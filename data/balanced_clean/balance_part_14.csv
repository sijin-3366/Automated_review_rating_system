4.0,"Just a heads up, the sequins on the dress give a really bad rubbing rash on the inside of your arms, so recommended to either wear a jacket or keep your arms off of your sides as much as possible. Other than that, a very pretty and well fitting dress"
4.0,"Bought the pink ones for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, and she loves them. That's saying a lot, as she owns more sunglasses than footwear, lol! 4 star cuz they aren't polarized."
4.0,"They were a little bit bigger than I thought they were going to be, but I've found a way to make them work."
4.0,Very nice put that final touch on any outfit.
4.0,"Nice but, the split is really high"
4.0,"Everytime I get something from China, I always look at the size chart and get a size bigger. From experience And then it fits"
4.0,I really like this top! It was a bit tight around my arms but not to the point of it being uncomfortable! It's flowy and great over other tops!
4.0,"So cute and comfortable. I was worried about the sleeves being too shirt because I'm taller, but the sleeves were plenty long. One less star because the Navy blue is starting to fade a bit after maybe 5 washes. Will buy another one when it doesn't look as fresh anymore."
4.0,the material is thick and plush which is what I was most worried with. The only complaint is that the color is more like a squashy/gold yellow than orange.
4.0,Super grippy the rubber isnt that strong thoe
4.0,"Material is more like a cotton t-shirt, thought it would be lighter and more flowy, very comfortable though"
4.0,Bought several of  different styles as gifts shipping was  a bit  slow but the  quality  seemed to be  good
4.0,The gloves will work very well for my purposes.  but they are thin and I had to cut off excess threads.  I don't think they will hold up to strenuous work.
4.0,"These socks are super soft and cute. They fit to mid calf on me and I wear a size 8 1/2  women's shoe. The colors are vibrant. They stay up without cutting into your legs, which is good because my legs do swell sometimes, and my socks will dig in at times. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't say much for how they hold up in the washer. The only reason for knocking a star off is they have a really strong chemical odor to them when you open the cellophane package that they are in. I really like the green pair I got, with the &quot;creeper&quot; from minecraft on it, and my son who is a minecraft freak thinks it's so cool that his mom has minecraft socks. They are doing a good job of keeping my feet cool as it is 90 something degrees in Iowa today. I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"The dress was actually really nice and good quality, too. However, the sizing was a bit off. We ordered a size 8 for my mom that is 5&#34;2 130lbs. and a B cup. Everything fit well except it was a bit bulky and big from the chest area all other areas it fit perfect. It was a bit long but expect it to be. I returned it because we just didn't want to deal with alterations. The color was also not a deep burgundy as I wanted it to be, it was more of a red crandberry color."
4.0,"For someone with no butt, these briefs definitely provided that. Now I just need to figure out when and where to wear them."
4.0,"Not the best looking of draft boards but it arrived on time, at a good price, and did the job. Only had two names that weren't included so a large majority of the players had stickers."
4.0,"It fit great until I washed it. Handwashed, cold water, air dry. Not sure if it was the heat outside or what, 107 degree's. Otherwise love the length, love the fit. Will be making a few adjustments now..."
4.0,This shirt runs small.  Had a really odd and bad smell but left after 1 wash.  Cute!  Thin material but ok for summer months.
4.0,These are good quality & price but almost a child's size. Still usable & really keep my legs warm
4.0,Adorable but they do run a little small
4.0,"I did measure the size before purchasing, but when I got them it was still a surprise. These are just too big for me. Aside from that, they are nice looking earrings for a fun look."
4.0,"Like the swimsuit.  It is bigger than expected and it does not show that they offer one size down, which would have been better. I am going to try with another carrier, as I see one that is similar with smaller size."
4.0,Would recomend. Wife loved it.
4.0,"Being tall I wish the straps were adjustable, but cute dress overall light and flowy"
4.0,"Material is wonderful and color as advertised.  However, although the body of the shirt fit well, the shoulders are fairly wide and the seam drops down off the shoulder."
4.0,Simple cute bridal shower dress!
4.0,"i ordered 3 purple and 3 silver. on one purple, 2 stones had fallen off! i was able to glue it back on. not as high quality as i hoped"
4.0,Purchase these for my Halloween costume can't wait until everything comes together...
4.0,"So cute! Ordered for my daughter to wear to a wedding. i purchased a size up and it does run short, maybe have your child wear spandex shorts under the dress just in case. Overall I am impressed with the quality for the price of the dress. Very adorable."
4.0,"I ordered the size small for my daughter. I think it will be ok, however it is Very small. I am only 114lbs & 5‚Äô6 small frame & I would definitely need a size med or large for it to fit like the model wearing it. My daughter is only 95lbs & 5‚Äô5 so that it why I say I think it will be ok...maybe."
4.0,"These are somewhat difficult to put on, but do such a great job the trouble is worth it. As good as surgical socks I've used in the past."
4.0,The crossover at the very bottom front of the bra can make a person look a bit lopsided if not positioned well in the cup.
4.0,These were pretty I just didn‚Äôt realize how big the gauge was on these babies so sadly I had to return. So just keep in mind if your holes are smaller!
4.0,"Fast shipping top area larger than I expected,  but love, material design"
4.0,"Haven‚Äôt washed them yet, so that will be a test"
4.0,Wonderful items.!!
4.0,"This fits my Note 10+ with Spigen slim armor case. It's a TIGHT fit on your controller. This really only has 1 usable angle. But as far as these things go, this one is perfectly servicable. My hands do get tired holding the controller with my phone attached, your mileage with this will vary."
4.0,"The shoes fit great, true to size, and they are a great addition to my closet.  They do scuff really easy though."
4.0,"So far the quality is pretty good, however it‚Äôs a bit uncomfortable if you don‚Äôt have a giraffe neck. I‚Äôm a bit chubby myself and my neck is too, so that means the chain pinches it every couple minutes. Not too shabby, it‚Äôs just that it can be uncomfortable at times. If you‚Äôre skinny, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fine."
4.0,They stay on my ears without hurting my ears.  The dangle is a nice balance to this round old face<br />(I like to think so anyway!) Nice to have attractive earrings when infections made me give up on pierced.
4.0,"Perfect fit, easy to install and replace the original one"
4.0,"The hood was a little weird, but it makes the perfect crop hoodie for the gym! üòÅ Sits perfectly well with my high waisted leggings to show off that pump üëÄüçë"
4.0,my daughter loves them!  Just be careful of the decorations falling off (or picked off by a 3 year old!)
4.0,"This costume was great for an office appropriate Halloween dress-up day. Like other reviewers mention, the skirt is a little thin and creeps up, so you definitely need leggings (or shorts) underneath. The edges of the skirt are unfinished so it rolls up a bit. But it looks great for the $20 I spent on it. I paired it with a curly wig, furry velvet leggings, and a homemade headband. It was comfortable and I will definitely be putting it in the closet to wear again."
4.0,"not as bright as i thought it would be, can still see it pretty good in the dark, i like the fact that i can tell everyone that i have a radioactive necklace  lol"
4.0,"Don't order up on size, it's big enough that you don't need to.  Cool design, very soft - I like it!"
4.0,"Cute, but the only thing is the color is way lighter than the pictures."
4.0,"I am 5'-8"" and 125lb. I ordered a medium size and regret it because the shirt comes oversized. I recommend ordering your usual size or a size smaller. I didn't mind the large size too much because the shirt is already very flowly and intentionally puffy. However, I had to wear a white bandeau or white spaghetti strap shirt so I wasn't overly exposed. The shirt is also see-thru so I recommend wearing something light underneathe. I liked the tie off in the neck area and the mid section with the bow string. It helped secure the shirt somewhat. The lacing around the shirt is absolutely gorgeous and the small details like the open slit in the neck area and the white buttons down the top make the blouse even more appealing. I ordered a white blouse and it goes with any type and color of pants or skirt."
4.0,Took a long time to arrive but it's what I expected
4.0,"It looks very cheap, but once on it was light, fit well and cute."
4.0,these fit me perfectly!!!! but they are cheaply made.  currently on my 3rd pair since i like the fit so well but they break easy.
4.0,The band is short!  I have a very small wrist for a guy that's 6:1.<br />Other than that; Casio watches are the BEST!  Ten year batteries!  I've wore Casio for around 40 years!  Never needed new batteries.  I usually catch it on something or break it before ever needing a battery.  I've never had one stop working!  In fact; I have one that I have had more than 10 years;; it's still going!  Casio deserves the Timex motto!  Takes the licking and keeps on ticking!!!  Sorry Timex!  Casio WINS!
4.0,"I bought small and as I have rather thick arms under the elbow, those sleevs are tight but other parts are okay and fit well. I am 5' and 128lbs. I didn't like bottuns - cheap colors and looks, may want to change them myself."
4.0,Fits good and love the look
4.0,"This is a flattering hat that provides great sun protection. It is foldable but still looks good without being too floppy. The hat is well constructed and features black grosgrain ribbon accents. There is an inner adjustable tab that allows the fit to be customized. But despite the product description saying this has a chin strap, mine did not. But overall this is a quality hat that is flattering and offers good sun protection. Perfect for summer for individuals of all ages..."
4.0,These shirts were really fun! Wore them to a food themed anniversary party and they were a hit. The women's medium was a little tight on me but I think that's just becaus it's a fitted cut which I usually do not wear. The large for my husband perfect. Have only wa shes once so we'll see how the print holds up
4.0,It is beautiful and comfortable. My daughter loves it. It runs big but it's  good because it will last her lfor a long time. :)
4.0,"This watch did a great job keeping a simple design but still looking aesthetically pleasing to the eye. However I am bummed out that it's so small/thin. I don't favor those big and thick watch bodies that everyone else does, so me saying this should hold some meaning to it. It does feel the size might make it a little more fragile too. Luckily the overall look and the feel of the leather still make this a watch worth wearing."
4.0,Cute skirt but the color is brighter orange in person than in the photo.
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful boots. The wine color is perfect. Not a total fan of the gold zipper,  although the cute faux zip tassle does cover it somewhat.  These do run about a half size larger as stated in most reviews. I can usually wear a 7.5 to an 8 US, so I went with a 7 to be on the safe side and they do fit like a 7.5. (Only reason I didn't give a five star rating.)<br />Fast shipping and packaging was done very well with each boot individually stuffed to hold shape and bagged to keep from scratching the velour looking exterior material.<br />Very happy with purchase and with an added 10% off coupon, I'll definitely be ordering another pair.."
4.0,"Love the sweater, fits perfectly,  but was dirty inside the package.  Dirt marks on the sweater."
4.0,Fit well and I am busty. Trim on the shorts is not as pictured but nice pajamas for summer nights.
4.0,Arm area tight. Like the product material not impressed with the built in bra appearance
4.0,"I love the feel of the fabric, there is TONS of room and I like how I can choose between the regular straps or add the long strap. I took a trip and flew but since I'm in a wheelchair, I couldn't easily take a carry-on bag in addition to my &#34;personal item&#34;. I packed my purse with my laptop (yup!), my tablet, the usual woman's everything under the sun things and snacks for myself and my grandson, then bought a bottle of water at the airport and it fit in there as well!! Yes, it has tons of room! Couldn't pick it up because it was so heavy, but everything fit and would even zip!<br />The negatives only take one star away for me since I do love the purse. I like a little more structure to my purses (it has no form to it at all so lays over and down all of the time). When attaching the long strap for putting over head and across my body, the regular straps don't detach and just hang (if I were to stuff them in the purse, it won't zip).<br />The purse material feels as though it will last a long time. I will update this if something changes. I'm very impressed and have had it 2 months now."
4.0,Love the fit but the white was a little see through.
4.0,"Fits good but I do not like the draw string bottoms, however this is only my preference. Pants overall are nice for the price."
4.0,What I like the most was the fit.  It material made the dress very comfortable to wear.  The dress was elegant.
4.0,Love this outfit and the colors. Its so cute just not loving the material of the pants. Real thin compared to cotton and shes gonna be a winter baby.
4.0,The look great!  Great value for the money.
4.0,"I was surprised at how comfy these were. I had bought a pair like these year from a known company and they always felt like they were coming off, these did not feel that way at all. Only downfall to them was the fabric that is wrapped around the toe area...it rubbed a little. i got these at discount as well."
4.0,The hat fits well and looks very nice.  It sends the message however the sequins fall off too easily yet still good for the price
4.0,They feel really nice but I would recommend sizing up
4.0,Perfect cover up at the beach or just a chill dress that's cheap. Might only look good this summer.
4.0,This will be a very nice shirt when the weather gets cold again. It fit as I expected which is always nice and sleeve length is perfect which is always a problem for me. The material is nice and feels like firm. This is definitely not a cheap feeling shirt! The only one thing that bothers me is the care instructions. Hand wash or dry clean only. For a 'casual' shirt that seems a bit extreme. That is the only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my 100% honest review.
4.0,I really liked how soft it was. I was surprised that it actually feels and looks great around your neck
4.0,The hat is nice. Good for a work hat. It is cheap but for $30 it is great.
4.0,"Overall great pajamas! I sized up and they fit my toddler well. She is average size, and I recommend going up one size if you want them to last awhile."
4.0,Brought our son a which needed a winder for Christmas and bought this winder with it. He says it works great. So good for the money.
4.0,"Just delivered and I have to say the packaging was beautiful, I love that it came in a lot early than expected. I absolutely love the weight on the watch, definitely a gorgeous piece.<br />Watch was a gift for my uncle. He loved it and couldn't stop picking it up and looking at it.<br />The same style as Gshock, the material used is far more than it. The colors are very nice and the watch is very durable. Good quality and heavy duty watchÔºÅ<br />I would recommend it to everyone I know, very good shopping experience. Each of my friends bought one."
4.0,Easy to use and protect the eyes from the laxer light
4.0,"This frame is great, awesome price for a pair of authentic prada frames and they fit perfect."
4.0,These hospital gowns wash and dry beautifully. They‚Äôre easy to put on and stay in place. I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because I think a pocket  on the chest would be very convenient.
4.0,This is a very nice watch but the bracelet is really cheap kind of feels and looks like tin. I brought a new bracelet for $35 and now it looks like a nice expensive watch. The way the bracelet is made is also a huge pain in the butt to remove.
4.0,"The ring was cute. I really liked it and it seemed durable. It was lighter than pictured which was fine. It was also too big, when I have always been a size 12. I had to pay for the return, almost 4 dollars, which sucked too, but it‚Äôs fine. O"
4.0,I ordered this for a Barristers ball. The theme was &#34;Great Gatsby&#34; and the headband made it easy for me to get into the theme.  The price was great and I'm very impressed with the quality.  The decorative prongs can be gently moved so it makes it easy to mold to your hairstyle.
4.0,"Sweet shoes as described. Go up a size, ie 7 1/2, order a 39. Fabulous customer service. Very happy with purchase especially at the price."
4.0,"NOT a 1.25‚Äù width, 1.5‚Äù width. The belt even says it right on it so I‚Äôm not sure why the product details advertise it as 1.25‚Äù. We were looking for a 1.25‚Äù, but I guess we‚Äôll settle for the thicker one üòí Other than the advertising issue everything works the way it‚Äôs supposed to. Good quality belt, we usually love mission belt."
4.0,Husband likes these and uses them for his computer work.  Ordered online to obtain the higher 3.5 strength we were unable to locate at local stores.  Attractive and very sturdy.  Spring tension on the arms.  Came with both a nylon pouch and a formed zipper case.  Would recommend.
4.0,"This wallet is perfect.  Arrived on time, perfect condition and color.  The snap is well manufactured.  The size was exactly what I needed to fit in a cross body purse."
4.0,"really thick winter gloves, a little too much for winter hiking and snowshoeing, I'll try them on an upcoming ski trip.  Can't believe anyone would find these gloves not warm enough!"
4.0,"They're actually very pretty and sturdy looking but they are ONLY &#34;frosted&#34; on the front portion of the hoop. I didn't notice that when I ordered so I'm sending them back. This may not be an issue for others, but I brought them specifically as hoops to go through my tunnel gauges so the one-sided &#34;sparkly&#34; look doesn't work for my purposes, personally."
4.0,Nice with that green ring
4.0,"I like this band very much. I got red instead of black because it was 10 cm shorter. My wrist is small enough that it can fold back under the links. Good weight and durability. The D-rings are sold and stitching is strong. The only thing I would change is the length. These bands are really made for a man's wrist. So they are too long for most women. If the length was ~250 cm, it would be better. But it is not so annoying that I want another brand. The quality wins out over the length issue - hand's down."
4.0,Very skin tight pretty good quality for the price very shiny and bright red just like the photos a little on the thin side runs small.
4.0,"I've used a couple of the sizes here, does the job well, however the bigger the taper is, the longer it gets, which gets pretty uncomfortable. But loved the colors!"
4.0,They are ok. Fit good and like the length but I had the stiching came out on one strap but nothing I can't fix.
4.0,"I purchased this Handbag for my wife for Christmas. She is very picky. We had looked at other purses the week before. I then looked on Amazon. Of course I looked at review after review. My wife has many black purses, I thought it would be nice to get a blue one. She was and is very happy with the Handbag. An extra plus, her CCW gun fits in the side zipper pouch. She likes how its made. Good quality. Her co-workers like it as well."
4.0,"Nice color, plenty of room although it is larger than I usually pick but is is very flexible so still works out okay."
4.0,Didn't realize front came off not ball. Alittle more difficult to work with. But pretty
4.0,This sweater is very soft and comfortable and will keep me warm in the cold winter months! The pockets are a wonderful feature. The fit is oversized which some may prefer and others may not.  I got a medium which I center alt get for cardigans because they shrink but I definitely could have gotten a small. I machine washed it on a regular cycle per the tag instructions and it pilled a little bit but I don‚Äôt think it shrunk. I read the care instructions online and it recommends a gentle cycle so I will do that next time.
4.0,"I was thinking these would be larger for more of a ""statement"" piece.  About the size of a pink pencil-top eraser.  Beautiful stones.  Red is dark -- looks very dark unless in the sun.  Overall nice and good quality."
4.0,"on bike:  maybe will not expose the goods if using a belt since the waist while not low,still fell and needed tugged up.  even exposed myself in a classroom where a student was on the ground and i had bent over to speak with him.  the reflective trim was well sewn and they rolled up easily and stayed put.  the fabric is a not quite middle weight but it's actually heartier than lightweight layers given the water resistance since in 80 degree whether it was a little warm.  the one zippered left leg side pocket is a little too far down on the leg to access while pedaling.  i could get the cell from the pocket easily, but returning it required slowing down and using 2 hands on the zipper.  not effective in traffic, so i'm hoping this gets easier to zip with use.<br /><br />off bike:  these pants are cut almost exactly like my JCrew or Lands End style chino's and they stretch and look quite presentable. if they made them in basic colors like black and grey and navy, no one would know the secret reflective strip existed and they're actually an on bike performance pant.  I opted out of riding in the rain with them today b/c i don't like arriving to work wet -- water does get in no matter what and the commute is much slower on rainy days -- but they seem sufficient for light showers, though all the coatings wear off over time.  i just couldn't get over how composed they were.  they won't wrinkle like cotton. but are very presentable.  planning to wear them rolled up (to look less jean like) with hard leather Fry penny loafers tomorrow.  fit:  i wear between 10-12 in Lands End and JCrew chino pants, but usually they're baggy.  these are a semi fitted cut, but they look quite nice.  i should note, i live in a mostly flat area but for a giant hill climb on the routes home, so my legs and butt are not typical biker big.<br /><br />after 8 hours, they remained pretty close to wrinkle free after a 6 mile ride then sitting during portions of my day.  i also believe the resisted odors enough to where i can possibly get away with a 2nd ride in them.  am atypically less sweaty and smelly though the gamey odor is no stranger, these pants smelled like new fabric after one ride.<br /><br />plz Club Ride, come out with a few more work friendly colors - black, grey, brown, ruby.  now that my boss said &quot;no shorts&quot;  am scrambling to supplement my wardrobe."
4.0,The shirt I received was a bit different from the picture but I decided to keep it anyway since it was a cute top. They contacted me right away to do a refund which I really appreciate.
4.0,"Size little small, but the quality of the product is good!"
4.0,i had to use pliers to get the ball off
4.0,These are super cute and my daughter loves them - we have had them since christmas and one of the lights is already messed up. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.<br /><br />Great price
4.0,Cute winter themed charm.
4.0,So the hoodie is true to picture. Really good stitching. The print isn't 100% sharp but not noticable unless you're really inspecting. The colors match the picture. Is not lined and is slightly thicker than costume material & slightly see through once on. I bought a large. I'm 5'4 130lb with C cup chest & this is snug like a hooded shirt which I don't like. Gave to my 5'0 100lb daughter who likes her hoodies loose & she loves it. Great quality for the price. Will reOrder myself an XL because I like my hoodies loose too.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful. Love it. Perfect for what I wanted it for. Only complaint is the quality of the wire it was wrapped with. But with a rewrap of wire it was completely perfect.
4.0,"pro : light, well made, great price, it have a timer which i like very much, it also have an alarm which is nice to have none the less, looks great/sporty<br /><br />cons: the viewing angle isn't great and if you are in low light rooms you need to click on the watch light button to see the time<br /><br />i hope that help"
4.0,Runs large indeed.  I didnt want to take the chance and order a size down so I ordered my size xl.  It's wayyyyy too big.  I believe a large or medium would fit.  I am 5'7 200lbs
4.0,Really cute. Runs a little big
4.0,"Thank you again for your quick service!  It arrived on our son's birthday, and the T-shirt was just as described.  The fit was perfect."
4.0,"My wife love's these, easy to mix and match colors."
4.0,"I bought this as part of a costume, it looks really nice ."
4.0,Only used it once. It's OK.
4.0,"This review is for Spikerking Mens No Show Cotton Deodorant Socks 3 Pack Crew Socks (Size:10-12).<br /><br />Overall these are good socks! However they do fit a bit small. My husband's feet are a 10.5/ 11 and they are pretty tight. When he first put them on he asked if they were women's socks because they came pretty low on the top of his feet. He adjusted them a bit and then tried on his shoes. We were worried that the skin on the top of his feet would touch his shoes but that wasn't the case. They wick sweat fairly well but are not totally deodorizing. My husband was happy with them though. He wore them to a basketball game and came back feeling fine even though he generally wears much thicker socks (they're pretty thin). If you're looking for a thick sock I might go with something else. But if you're looking for thin socks that won't show but would still sustain some athletic wear, check these out!<br /><br />Disclaimer: Please note that I received these Spikerking Mens No Show Cotton Deodorant Socks at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Opinions are entirely my own. I depend on reviews and know that you do too. I hope this review is helpful for you!"
4.0,"Everyday wear, but not as pictured; can't see day and date clearly; smaller than in picture,"
4.0,"It is a really gorgeous pair of gloves; quite handsome.  VERY soft and well made. I got a large, after finding that a medium was too small. The large barely fits and that makes them not so comfortable for driving."
4.0,"very well mad solid and works, one slight draw back is a little thick but I guess if wasn't would probably bend easy."
4.0,Very comfortable and well fit.
4.0,I really love this blouse and the vendor for such quality. The blouse is vibrant in color and rather durable material.  It is better than the picture. I purchased this one in dine after buying one in white months ago.  I get so many compliments on it. Looking to get another blouse like this or at least by the seller.  Thanks
4.0,"Bought as a gift for grandson , he likes it very much"
4.0,Good quality and nice print on scarfs
4.0,to small tp fit over glasses
4.0,"I bought this coat specifically for my trip to Canada. I didn't have any coats that I felt would be durable enough to last the cold weather there. This coat was exactly what I was looking for. It was durable, super warm, and is even lined in the inside! I like that it kept me super warm and that I was finally able to get a coat that had a hoody that WOULD stay up. Such a great buy, I'm extremely glad I took my chances and got this coat. The only thing I wish it didn't have is the faux pockets. It would've been nice if the pockets in front actually buttoned and unbuttoned."
4.0,It's fresh style is great.  The vest can be layered which makes it flexible.
4.0,The 4T is actually the size of a 3T. If you want room to grow I'd go up 2 sizes!
4.0,My granddaughter went nuts for it. Since all she wears these days are tutus and pink this was perfect. She‚Äôs 3 and it fit her perfectly I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs pretty average size for her age if your little girl is thick I‚Äôd go a size up.
4.0,"Very cute, but you have to be careful because I almost snapped the post (the piece that goes through your ear) off by accidentally putting the back on backwards."
4.0,"I'm loving compression socks as being a nurse, my legs tend to swell and my feet ache after a shift.  These aren't &#34;amazing&#34; or &#34;life changing&#34; but, I would recommend them to a friend or coworker."
4.0,"Good quality for the price - needed a going out purse to carry my wallet, keys and phone. Converts into a clutch with hooked strap. Fits much more than expected. Note: the clasp/lock doesn't close well - make sure it clicks. Will drop all your things if you're lazy like I was once or twice!"
4.0,"I like these glasses. They are light and polarized. Even though they are light in color they are fashionable. I wish that they get more darker in the sun, but they work quite well."
4.0,"The shirt was a bit to snug around the collar for me.  I did go up a size because of the design of the collar.  The shirt is a nice material and did fit loosely as I wanted.  Would have given five stars, if not for the collar."
4.0,"This is a very nice bag. What I like most is the flat bottom and upright sides that dont sag or fold over. It keeps its shape. The leather, stitching and details are all nicely done. The bag has a quality look and feel. The thing I really dont like about this bag is that the two handles are very thin and round so when the bag is loaded up, with thin straps it isnt comfortable to carry over the shoulder. I wish they had made wider straps for such a large bag."
4.0,Tinkerbell is smaller than I expected...but still a beautiful Pandora charm.
4.0,"Ease of use, easy to breathe in, and stylish to boot. Sits around neck and so easy to just pull up to cover."
4.0,"I swim a lot and these goggles are good. My four stars instead of five represents the fact that sometimes the goggles get clouded when I'm swimming adn that's not supposed to happen, but I love the package and am enjoying these."
4.0,Warms fast
4.0,"So far so good. Its a cute wallet (looks as pictured) and holds everything pretty well. The biggest problem I have is with the card holders.  There are no bottoms to the vertical card holders (that go above your ID), so if you are not careful when putting your card back in your wallet it can slide all the way down into the pocket and you will have to take out all of your cards and hope your fingers are small enough to reach in and get it out. As for my horizontal card holders (which are supposed to fit two cards side by side) one side of the holders is too small to fit any cards. Not a huge deal if you don't have a lot of cards but kind of annoying.  Overall though, for the price, you can't beat it."
4.0,"I'd like to reserve a 4 star review for a few more weeks, so far this is comfortable and very nice."
4.0,"Cannot complain,as they were one cent, but the posts are very different sizes, so be sure to have extra backs on hand; neither packed with the studs really fit.<br />I recommend ordering disc backs, so they sit correctly in lobes.<br />Not good for gifting, as the quality is very low, but they are Very Sparkly and will win complements every time!"
4.0,I wear these almost daily in winter and they are cute with shorter skirts or hiking shorts
4.0,Bright red and lightweight.  Perfect for my needs.
4.0,My daughter loves the fit and like the simple style
4.0,get compliments when I wear it
4.0,"when the wheels are tucked in, (to enter a store) if my 6 year old wears them longer than 1/2 hour, her legs start to hurt a little.  the shoes don't seem to bend very much for walking.  (way too clunky to run.)  but absolutely perfect for what they are supposed to be used for - the wheels.  they even glide over rough pavement. she can also wear them without socks and not get blisters. her favorite part is that they light up."
4.0,"It feels very good, heavy and pretty. However, if the necklace touches your skin, the color will fade off soon..."
4.0,"The chest covering (breast area) was entirely too small.. other than that; the outfit was nice, material good & ‚Ä¶"
4.0,"Very nice-looking watch.  Accuracy is better than expected for a mechanical watch.  I gave it 4 stars because, unlike my other Invicta Pro Divers, this one was difficult to remove links to get it to fit.  Even with a link pin tool, the tool was bending rather than pushing out the link pins.  My other Invictas were easy to size but not this one.  Not sure why."
4.0,"Seems like it generally runs small but the graphic is sweet, just order a size up from normal. Hope the graphic lasts"
4.0,I go this for someone and it looks great on her. I haven't heard any complaints but I cant truly attest to it as I am not the one wearing it :)
4.0,Love the bags but the zippers get caught at the corners. Probably just the fact that it's rectangular.
4.0,"Cute dress that can be dressed up or down. I wear a large in everything, and purchased a large, and it looked a little drab on me. But maybe add cute cardigan and it would be perfect."
4.0,The description & comfort are great. Great top to go with leggings. Will purchase more colors.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and between 125 and 130 pounds generally and I found the medium to be a good fit, but it's a little shorter than you might expect. The sleeves are long enough, though. It's a very high quality knit and the graphic is as soft as the rest."
4.0,"For the great price, it's obviously not going to look absolutly perfect, but it's very pretty & seems durable & functional."
4.0,I'm so heartbroken-these are so cute and such great quality but I had to return them since they were too narrow.
4.0,The fit of the mask was great for my small head but would be a bit tight for a larger person. It is okay at moisture wicking - I‚Äôve been wearing it at boxing classes. Stays in place but does stretch a little when wet
4.0,Had to return too big. But nice shoes.
4.0,"Cute dress, skirt is a little on the large side, even for a small size"
4.0,Very thick I find them hard to breathe in. But very pretty!
4.0,"The fox is incredible!However the chain is cheap and broke the second day my daughter had it, just taking her shirt off it got caught in it and snapped!So I suggest buying your own chain."
4.0,I love so perfect
4.0,"This is a good quality fabric,  thick, soft hoodie.  My teenager loves it."
4.0,Definitely a little smaller than I thought it would be even knowing the dimensions. But it works very well for what I needed and so far I'm really happy with the purchase.
4.0,"The watch is awesome for the price, I needed a watch for Basic Training and this one has fit the bill.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about this watch is the light that illuminates the face display. It‚Äôs not very bright and only really light up about half of the face. But I guess I can‚Äôt expect too much with the price being as low as it is.<br /><br />All around good product."
4.0,"Slightly see through, but then a choose a light color. the dress is cute and stylish. It fits well. I thought the material was going to be smooth but it is a textured material similar to the old Izod style polo tops. Overall, I like the dress."
4.0,"These pants are definitely better than expected. The quality is a sturdy material and does have a nice shape. However, they balloon up more than I expected and the metal chain could be of better quality. Mine came with a belt loop coming off, but that was quickly fixed with a bit of fabric glue. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,It‚Äôs cute! I wish I ordered a size bigger just because I really wanted to wear it as a dress with tights but either my body shape wouldn‚Äôt allow it or I just needed a bigger size..
4.0,My son likes these glasses very much.
4.0,I work at a grocery store that requires black slacks. I Wear them to work all the time and they are so comfortable. They do stretch out a bit by the end of the day.
4.0,"These shoes take a little getting used to, but once you do they're pretty amazing. I wear them when I go hiking, and plan on exploring streams and such. They are however a little uncomfortable fresh out of water, as most shoes are."
4.0,little hard to fit
4.0,"Thought the chain would be a little longer, and the elephant wouldn't be as big which is why I'm giving it four stars but overall it's beautiful and I love it."
4.0,The watch is high quality and I really comfortable! The strap color is different than pictured and wish that it was darker to contrast the color of the wood.
4.0,"Love the shirt, the quality is a bit lackluster but it's overall great for the price."
4.0,Was slightly smaller than I expected. So I didn't end up wearing it.  Dress is pretty though.
4.0,Dress fits well but jacket to small in the arms
4.0,"They‚Äôre cute, but you‚Äôre obviously getting what you paid for, they haven‚Äôt broken (I‚Äôve only worn them a handful of times and I take care of my sunglasses) but the material isn‚Äôt so sturdy. They do come as pictured."
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if i didn't have to saw an inch to make it smaller, other than that it's beautiful, stylish, unique! Bought the gold version too."
4.0,"These are good for the price, however, you‚Äôll have to size up about 2 sizes. They run small. I‚Äôm usually a large, so I ordered an XL. Should‚Äôve gotten an XXL lol. No pockets and they do roll down if you have some Chubb. Great that there‚Äôs no crotch seam, though."
4.0,"I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for a review. So what I can say about this product is it's very comfortable to wear and fits nice. The sound quality is actually better than I thought it would be! Very easy to pair as well. The only negative is if using this for voice calling it is very low on the other person's end. However this function isn't a deal breaker for me, as I mainly intend to use this for listening to audio while out and about. I am really pleased with this product!"
4.0,"There was a small discoloration on one of the shoes. They looked like they had been worn once by looking at the bottom of the shoe and the stain. I almost sent them back but decided to use this pair for work. I have not looked at the other pair yet. Overall, I‚Äôm still satisfied with the shoe."
4.0,"My only complaint is that I wish it were a little longer. However, it looks exactly like the picture so not deceiving."
4.0,"Well, I though it would be good for running errands after covid hit, a bit of extra coverage over the mask. Good enough for that. The brim is very narrow is not good for sun protection."
4.0,Was nice suit but just to big and feel the smaller one would have been too tight
4.0,"Wish the fabric is more thicker, even if its double layered still see true, i could pay a little more."
4.0,"Was a little bigger than I would‚Äôve liked, but it was fine."
4.0,"I only wear fitted shirts because I have very long arms.  I was disappointed when I got this shirt and the collar was about a half inch large and the sleeves we're at least one inch long. Otherwise it was a great shirt.  Well built and nice fabric, it just didn't look great with the entire cuff regularly pulling completely out of the tuxedo jacket."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful print on a nice sheer bodysuit that you can wear in all seasons. The fit is nice, but remember because it is sheer material you do have to be careful not to snag or run it"
4.0,They arrived on time and in tact. I ordered a size 0 and as i expected the design was a bit small/ unnoticeable up close. I think the design is better suited/more noticeable on a larger size. How ever I still like the way they look. They wear comfortably and i'd find them true to size.
4.0,"Cuts glare from oncoming headlights, even work in the daytime in a pinch."
4.0,hat is perfect.  Gloves are a little on the large side (my daughter is 2)
4.0,"Really like it. Fits great, i think its true to size."
4.0,"the colors are not exactly true to the images on screen - the blue is a deeper, darker blue, the green is not as deep as shown.  others have reported that it is one big pocket, that is not the case with the ones i received- there are two lines of invisible stitching going down the width of the scarf about 9 inches apart, in effect creating a large 9 by 13 pocket."
4.0,"Fits me well,good fabric material.I wear it daily.I like it's leopard print."
4.0,"I bought it for my son, he loved it but i think it‚Äôs very big"
4.0,"I like the way they make me look, very flattering, especially since I'm pretty curvy.  They are really thin, which is nice when you want to wear these under something else, and probably for running too- but I probably won't use them for that.<br /><br />I wish they were a little thicker, at least on the top section, because the top bit rolls down just a little bit (like an inch or less) as I'm wearing them.  They stay mostly in the same place as where I want them, it's just a tiny annoyance to have them rolling a little.<br /><br />Update: I think they are a wee bit see through when I bend over.  I won't be wearing these in public, anyway, so that doesn't matter that much to me, but I know that's a big deal for a lot of people.<br /><br />But it is nice that they have pockets on both sides, they stretch pretty far, which probably means they can hold a lot.<br /><br />Other than that, I love them! They're exactly what I was looking for, and I'm loving the navy color, too!"
4.0,"First off, these are awesome, I love them and wear them around for fun all the time. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, the bottom of the shoes are super soft like a really thin material. These are going to wear out REALLY fast on the bottom."
4.0,Nice<br />Getting really great<br />Compliments
4.0,Nice band but is really small...
4.0,The black material is very silky. The zipper is a gold color and does cause the fabric to push out a little.
4.0,"The service was great and the necklace was of good quality.  I just didn't expect the necklace to be so large.  It would have been good to have a picture with it on a model, so buyers can see the size on a person."
4.0,"Material was very soft and stretches. Top runs small, but still look nice"
4.0,"This product came with a rip on the inside seam (right glove -little finger). Feeling like I already paid too much for a pair of gloves, I contacted the company directly and they are shipping me a new pair immediately. I only had to provide pictures of the damaged product and an order number.<br />Very pleased that they stood by their product and made things right.<br />The product itself (aside from the tare) is of food quality and very warm. I will be buying more in the future."
4.0,It runs a bit smaller.
4.0,They were as described !!
4.0,"Very cute dress! The belt that came with it is a great color, but it will not last long with heavy use. A slip or nude undergarments is a necessity with this dress. I'm 5'2&#34; and it sits above my knees without being too short. I feel like this is long enough for taller people as well."
4.0,"I love this robe, it's so cute and light weight, perfect for the summer robe I was looking for! I did read a review about how it is open in the front area, and I very much agree with that. The way that the robe front is shaped does leave room for a full frontal view. I don't mind because I'm usually wearing panties, and my boyfriend doesn't seem to care either. üòÇ"
4.0,So cute. Exactly as pictured.<br />The pants are too short but my daughter is y‚Äôall for her age.
4.0,This shirt is well made but is cut for a petite child. I'm glad my granddaughter is slight of build or this wouldn't have fit her. Order a size bigger if your child is regular sized and not petite. The decal washes nicely and keeps it's color.
4.0,Love the vibrant colors of this dress and the fit. Length is good and dress fits well. I've washed it with no color fade at all and it dries almost instantly.<br />I'm not a fan of the material. It's not good in a hot climate (humidity worse). The dress tends to trap in heat and moisture.<br />I think this dress will be best as a autumn or spring dress. I am looking at ordering another in a different pattern.
4.0,ORDERED 2 PKGS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE IS VERY HAPPY. THEY ARE LARGE AND WASH UP VERY WELL.
4.0,"I bough these for my two year old daughter. They are true perfect size for her. She has been wearing them for a few weeks now and they have not turned her ears green or changed color in anyway. They only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5  is that the alignment of the back was slightly off and I had to adjust it, once I did they were perfect."
4.0,"Super cute, but I took away a star because youd have to wear a strapless bra and the material is so thin you can see the bra lines. So unless you want to go bra-less, consider a different dress."
4.0,"It arrived later than expected, but worth the wait. It can fit 2 regular size cereal boxes. Strap is long and you will need to punch holes yourself for desired length.. if you are familiar with leather you know it has a scent, but nothing overpowering. Was a bit stiff and comes with care instructions to loosen it. So far happy with purchase."
4.0,nice i like it  thank you
4.0,"I liked the print on this dress but it arrived with visible dirt on it, and like it had been tried on by a much bigger person that stretched it out in the thighs/hips."
4.0,"A little smaller than expected,  but seems to be good quality."
4.0,This suit is gorgeous!  It took a little bit of time to get on past my bigger hips...the lace by the belly does not stretch like the swimsuit material so if you have bigger hips you kind of just have to wiggle into it.  Haha.  Once it was on though it fit great.  Looking forward to wearing it on vacation.
4.0,It‚Äôs a nice leather band. Fits good and feels good.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings.  I purchased the platinum and rose gold pairs.<br />The platinum pair came in a beautiful, high quality velvet box.  The rose gold pair came in a cardboard-like box.  Quite a difference in presentation.<br />Both pairs of earrings are dainty and sparkling.  They are not heavy and will not 'droop' off the ears. If you put a round plastic back on them, they will sit flat against the earlobe.<br />The earrings are 1/2&#34; across.  They are not large and gaudy: they're small enough to look authentic and realistic.<br />The only reason I am giving 4/5 stars is that the presentation boxes are so different in quality."
4.0,Top has underwire so u look nice without looking like u have 1 breast across ur chest like some swimsuits.  Would be nice if they went by bra size.  But this is the best alternative u can get.  No complaints.  Very nice
4.0,"It's a nice shirt but the material isn't what I thought it would be, I wouldn't wear it it I'm doing work or cooking the material is so thin, if it's a casual shirt for you then yes the Jason portrait is awesome but if you get dirty and cut up a lot than no, maybe they'll carry it in a tougher fabric if so I'll definitely buy again"
4.0,Somewhat small but o can pull it off...
4.0,"After paying $50+ for watch bands, I decided to reduce my costs.  I have 7 watches with ""leather"" bands.  This band looks and feels OK to me, and is the right price.  You get the band with the insertion tool and some weird looking metal pellets that I can't determine how to use.  Just remember to use the tool's  ""forked"" end to remove and replace the pin.  It's a struggle sometimes, but be patient."
4.0,"Thin material, bleeds sometimes when you sweat, but looks and feels cool."
4.0,"Nice coverage, no visible panty outline under slacks, washes well."
4.0,"We love this! It is so cute!!! It is flowy and soft! The belt is a little cheap either masking tape on the end, but other than that no complaints."
4.0,Very cute case. I put it in my car with 2 pairs of back-up shoes.
4.0,Kinda small..but I like the material.
4.0,"This piece is exactly what it looks like on the front with one bead out of place.  I'll fix that.  However the back looks like it was pressed together by hand...not like the product picture leads you to believe.  However...<br /><br />If you like the bohemian look, and you can tolerate the back looking like a broach - this piece gives you that earthly look that will go well in pictures...and it is $3 with free shipping."
4.0,"Arrived as advertised. I love the color and the pockets. I wish they were dry fit. However, they are true to size- Large"
4.0,This was a great kaftan to wear during the summer
4.0,"I chose this watch after looking at pictures submitted by others, and it is beautiful. It can be worn for a special night out (I purchased the black & silver), or for every day.<br /><br />I read a review from someone who said they had a 6"" wrist and it fit perfectly. Since I had measured my ""bracelet size"" according to what's recommended for buying bracelets or watches. My wrist: 5 3/4"" + 1/2"" (as recommended) = 6 1/4"" so being sure it would fit, I bought it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if I'm wearing a sleeveless or short-sleeved top, it seems too big for my tastes.  Let me stress that part, ""for my tastes"", because it's a keeper and will be perfect when I'm wearing long sleeves with the cooler weather.  It's just too pretty not to!"
4.0,This jacket is my favorite!! I wear it to school all the time ^^. It keeps my warm and its fuzzy c: The only thing i was was better was that the button thingys were more secure
4.0,price versus hat was super. It was inexpensive but if a person expected a hat that will last many fishing trips. I have a feeling they may be disappointed. I have no problems with the hat and I do enjoy wearing it but based on the quality of the material used to make the hat I have a feeling it will tear easy.
4.0,These are perfect fit and don't slip off andgive great traction.
4.0,Very comfortable and easy to put on. I'm hoping this will be more durable than the silicon ones.
4.0,Top is just as pictured.
4.0,"The case seems to be enough protection, I'm not very hard on my phone but have dropped it once since having it in the case.  The screen is responsive--no issues there.<br /><br />The case was really easy to put on the phone, and it comes with a pry tool for opening it back up.  It also comes with a wrist strap, but I chose not to attach it.  I won't use the kick stand feature much because I have a Pop Socket on the back (I use in my car to hang on the dash).  The camera and flash openings don't interfere with those functions and both the speaker and mic sound/work just fine.<br /><br />The only two things that I would say is that the right-hand &#34;wake&#34; button is hard to push (I've got some tennis elbow going on, so it is noticeable to me--might not be for others) and the cover for the charging port is really hard to get out, BUT the case is supposed to be water proof, so I get that there needs to be a tight seal.  As water proofing isn't a feature I was looking for anyway, I may just end up removing the cover completely.<br /><br />I don't usually buy these kinds of &#34;big&#34; cases, but I'm really happy with this one and feel better knowing my phone is protected from accidental drops."
4.0,I get many complements on this ring. fits great. it looks a tad cheap compared to my other gemstone rings but its still a nice little addition.
4.0,"Wife has only worn these a couple times, so no observations on long-term wear-ability.  They do fit very nicely and look sexy with a halter or baggy top and heels.  Great for an inexpensive &#34;rocker&#34; look."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:996810dc1158aa9f1155c82754f0811f]] Perfect costume accessory! The smell was super synthetic, about It looked so good I had to wear it. I also have a small neck so I had to overlap/clasp to the lace instead of the lil metal extension. Overal, really satisfied! I got it for Halloween and was pretty pleased."
4.0,Love my socks. So comfortable. Will order more for myself and cowokers. Makes a good Christmas gift for Nurses
4.0,I liked the color.  It is a bit flashy.  If flashy is your style you will love it.
4.0,Cheap construction (rolling a bit at the neckline) but I get lots of compliments when I wear it.
4.0,I like it but the finish wears off quickly where it overlaps. But that doesn't show when it is secured on your wrist.
4.0,my wife likes it but the studs are capable of coming off.  I put the ones that came off back on and no problems since. Someone reviewed that the purse was bulky-  theirs must have been different than the one I purchased because it is not that big.
4.0,I like but not as much as I thought I would and material was not what I expected.
4.0,I'm going to sew/taper the bottom corners because I don't like square bottoms. Its fits so cute that I don't mind doing that quick work. So cute!
4.0,Had to return the first one...size was too small...had to re-order one size larger...
4.0,"This sweater is a nice knit material, fits well, but is somewhat short in the sleeves. I maybe would size up if you want it to fit like the photo. I typically wear an XS [5'5&#34;,115lb] and went with the small and wish that maybe I went with the medium. See photos for fit. [Also I didn't intentionally dress like the model, just so happened to be what I was wearing when the package came]"
4.0,"The OSFM sizing is close to the standard New Era 39Thirty sizing of M/L.  That being said I typically wear a L/XL and this hat, while a little snug, fits fine without being uncomfortable.<br />If you normally wear a S/M size this hat will most likely fit too big."
4.0,It is a pretty blouse with lace on the back. I‚Äôm glad I purchased it.
4.0,"These sunglasses are very cute and also huge, which was fine for my Janis Joplin costume. But they are a bit on the flimsy side, very thin, and had I purchased them to actually wear on the regular as sunnies, I would be highly concerned I would break them quickly. Great for a costume piece and occasional use."
4.0,"Love this dress, but I didn't realize how long it was.  The model was taller than me.  I am 5 ft 2 and I ordered a small.  It didn't look good at all on me until I added a belt and kind of shortened it by blousing up the dress, if that makes sense."
4.0,"Very cute, but too expensive!"
4.0,"Super cute set! The necklace came twisted and slightly damaged, but I was able to fix it with some tweezers and small clamps."
4.0,"Very nice flowy fabric. Soft, just as pictured."
4.0,My grandson had fun playing with this.
4.0,Nice I Like it
4.0,Son unos lentes ligeros y el estilo espectacular a la moda protegen el 100% de los rato solares y dejan ver perfectamente entre al frente ya que a los lados yo tengo que voltear la cabeza especialmente cuando estoy manejando porque me dificulta la visibilidad m√°s sin embargo las recomiendo.
4.0,"Every woman needs a basic black maxi in her summer closet and this is perfect!! Super soft, long but not too much (I am 5'3 and touches just at the ground) Ordered a medium, I am 170lbs and about 34DD. The material up top seems a little thin but I wear cardigans all day at work so I can hide it."
4.0,little sharp on post
4.0,Good quality. The top of hats material is thick. My be hot in the summer. I recently bought a similar hat from another vendor which I like better. For price I am pleased with purchase
4.0,Needed something strapless to get some sun before my wedding day. This top was cute and pretty comfy
4.0,"I like it - it's slouchy as slouchy gets.  It is reversible but it has one design flaw - the two sides are not fused together so it rolls up on the forehead, exposing the other side.  I imagine this can be remedied by rung the opening through a sewing machine in order to lock both sides in place so there is not roll back."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; a 34D & 155lbs - always self conscious of my stomach area, so I ordered the large.  Pants are always short on me, my height is in my legs, and the legs are a bit long.  It fits great and does not hug my middle.  It has the texture of very thick cotton.  I couldn't tell from the photo, I thought it was a turtle neck, but it actually zips up to like a mock neck, but it looks weird all the way zipped, the neck bulges.  Its fun, it just will serve a different purpose, as there will be less that I can wear it under."
4.0,I wish I would have gotten one size smaller. But other than that it's a cute little jelly sandal.
4.0,"A little on the smaller side. Bought for my husband for Halloween, but didn't fit."
4.0,Thought they were posts but the picture wasn‚Äôt very good.
4.0,"I was really thrilled with this product! It was exactly what I wanted and fit great. However, I would not dry them. All of them have shrunk and are no longer great. They come off my feet hourly. It took couple washes for this to happen."
4.0,like will order more
4.0,its way to tight and i dont have a large head.
4.0,Light weight similar to Chilly ' s brand
4.0,"Nice shirt for my daughter, but was a little small in places"
4.0,"The costume itself is gorgeous and well made, however the size chart is not accurate. I measured myself and ordered according to the chart, but it was about 2 sizes too small. I would not recommend this if you are bigger, but if you are small you should be okay, just double check about sizing with the seller"
4.0,"Good product. Thin, light, and cropped perfectly. Quality zipper as well!"
4.0,"I love them. I have thunder thighs, so they are a bit snug."
4.0,The chains are absolutely beautiful. Great workmanship and not a bad price. Would recommend to others. Smooth transaction all the way.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&quot;, 117 pounds, and I usually wear a size 0 in pants. It's soft and size x-small fits me perfectly. The only con is that it attracts lint because of the material. Other than that, it's a great staple to have in your closet!"
4.0,"So I decided to review these as soon as I got them (literally 5 minutes ago lol). So when I received them, they came in a plastic package bag with another smaller transparent plastic bag for the earrings. The jewels, up close, look obviously fake and overall, the earrings look bent forward just a tad. I was going to rate it five stars BUT, as you can see, one of the backs is bent which made me sad. I tried to gently bend it but, in risk of breaking it, I stopped. Good news is when the earrings are in, particularly the bent one, it doesn't hurt. Also, the earrings are heavy-ish since it's mostly metal but, as you where them longer, you forget they're there so, your earlobes probably won't stretch. Overall, they're really good for their price!! Note: the bent earring back us the last picture with it in my ear on my right side."
4.0,"Received the item in a timely manner. The packaging was neat. Not sure if I love the material, it reminds of a bathing suit. The design, however, is still nice. Naturally, I won't be able to wear knickers whilst wearing this. I am about 5' and it sits on me just right."
4.0,True to fit and the color to the bottoms are gorgeous!
4.0,"I ordered a medium because I expected it to be fitted, but there‚Äôs a little extra space in the back. I really love it though. Super comfortable."
4.0,"Comfortable and for as expected. Durable and haven‚Äôt worn out after wearing half a dozen times and washing them. I love that they are footless. I would not say they are co trip too or that they mold to your shape. As with a lot of brands, they stretch out as the day goes on and the crotch hangs down a bit. Maybe try a size smaller than your normally wear?"
4.0,This bag was purchased for my husband for his birthday.  I was surprised that it was so small but he loves it.  He immediately took his old bag and loaded everything into this new one.  The best part was that it has so many compartments and places to secure items that it was a real winner in his eyes.
4.0,"gifted it to a friend and love the complete packaging, box and a little card which came with it. Also the bracelet is beautiful, my friend loved it .<br />Would definitely recommend."
4.0,Everything okay
4.0,A little bigger then expected
4.0,i like them!
4.0,"I have several leopard coats, but this one fits the best and has the best color."
4.0,"Idk why other reviewers are saying they‚Äôre the same as NVGTN because they‚Äôre NOT. The fabric composition is entirely different. So beware.<br /><br />I compared the royale blue AOXJOX leggings to the NVGTN leggings in forest green. Bought an Extra Small and I will say these are true to size.<br /><br />For starters, the Aoxjox leggings are not the softest; in fact, when I put them on the first time they felt pretty scratchy/stiff. These are slightly bigger and fit looser than the actual NVGTN leggings. The NVGTN leggings have so much more stretch to them, as well, and they are softer. Not even fabric softener made the leggings as soft as NVGTN.<br /><br />Fabric composition includes Nylon, Polyester and Spandex...These would have been the perfect NVGTN dupes if they had used the same fabric as them (87% Nylon/13% Spandex).<br /><br />The design of the leggings itself is cute, however, I will mention that I had to pull up the leggings in the back in order for the booty contour to sit right under the booty.<br /><br />Unless they change the fabric composition to just Nylon and Spandex then I probably won‚Äôt buy another pair. I‚Äôm glad I tried them, though!"
4.0,Needed a size up.
4.0,Really cute suit
4.0,Was smaller then expected (in pocket capacity) but good quality
4.0,"Absolutely stunning, and great quality but the post was way too long for my nose. Otherwise, would definitely recommend!"
4.0,"A set of loosely falling top with drawstring pants with very wide openings on each pant leg. I included a picture with arrows to provide a visual to understand what I mean when I said ""wide"" as each is exactly twelve (12) inches across. My personal opinion of that is wider than most. Perhaps just me, but thought worth mentioning.<br />I need to be honest again ""personally"", I have to say I am not overly fond of the feel of the material. 100% polyester, no problem with the poly as I have several items made of the same. No? Is it possible the way it is produced as in the material process in the original before being made into an outfit? I know nothing of manufacturing, so total conjecture on what the problem is that I do not find that comfortable. But it just seems rough when wearing. Again this could be my problem and no one else will find it.<br /><br />I ordered a medium and it fit as expected & surprisingly a smidge roomier without being baggy which was nice. Hence, I think this would be an excellent traveling outfit. Comfortable in size, not overly warm, and with a jacket just in case (as I never know how the weather/temp might be when flying) and stylish enough to not be considered a sweat/tracksuit. The true color is noticeable in the darker color within pictures, excuse the other ones in color. Somehow my camera captured a much lighter shade than the truth. And wanted to ensure the actual shade was shown as it is a great fall tone. I also found the bottom of the sleeves pleasing (shown in the attached picture) as I have a top similar but without the higher cuffs and I find this type much better in case I want to push up. They stay up on arm and I dislike folding sleeves.<br /><br />All in all the entire cut and color is very attractive, again I am unsure what about the material I personally find it a bit off. But will not be so displeasing that I don't plan on wearing it. I plan on wearing it on an upcoming flight and I am certain it will be a good choice."
4.0,"I was really excited to try this on, but it would not blow up. I used new batteries and made sure I followed the instructions correctly several times, but nothing. I emailed the seller  on 3/17 and have not received a response back.<br /><br />Update: Was able to get a replacement fan. You need to make sure the batteries are strong, or this won't work. It didn't blow up like the picture, but I still like it. I will try it again properly and update to see how it holds up in a walk"
4.0,"I ordered this for my son's 19th birthday.  He is 5'10"" tall and weighs about 155 lbs.  I ordered the medium size and it fits him perfectly.<br /><br />We will make sure to wash it in cold water and hang dry it.  If it shrinks, it'll be too small.  He got a kick out of the message on the front, which was, of course, the whole reason for ordering it.<br /><br />The quality is about what you would expect from a novelty t-shirt like this....the material is fairly thin and the lettering is iron-on.  It does seem well stitched though, and the collar seems tight and also secure in its stitching.<br /><br />Overall, we are quite pleased with it and I am happy that I ordered it, it was a big hit when he opened it."
4.0,"Very vibrant color. Material is very soft and comfy. I did end up returning this dress due to the fact that the waist falls on an odd part on the body. It‚Äôs not high enough to be an empire waist, but not low enough either and made for a weird look when being worn. I tried to cover with the tie, but was unable to get over the waistline. I wish I could have kept this dress because it was super comfortable."
4.0,"This runs small and in Asian sizes. I say that because of the tags. If your a man who wears XL normally, you'll get the 3X in this. Don't be alarmed, it balances out and the fit is almost right. Possibly a little snug but it depends how you like to wear sweaters. I bought as a Christmas gift. It is great material and thick. A good looking sweater."
4.0,"I love it, only thing the two strings tend to fall down a little so it looks like a one strand choker and I have to separate them a lot, my neck is normal sized so I don't think it's cause my neck is too small. still like it a lot"
4.0,"I really like the design and material of these leggings, but unfortunately the legs were too tight for my wife despite being the same size as all of here other leggings. So if you're like my wife and have thicker legs, I'd suggest passing on these."
4.0,I like it. For the price is just what i was looking for.
4.0,"They are oversized in lens shape, just like I ordered, but a bit loose around the ears so they fall often but I also have a relatively small head so take that into consideration when buying. Otherwise, really pretty shades (mostly cosmetic, don't have practical use as sunglasses.)"
4.0,Runs a bit small. It feels great and looks great. It‚Äôs very soft. Perfect for cold weather but not freezing weather.
4.0,Very cute. But very delicate.  Won't hold up to washing.
4.0,Easy to use. Good for routine cleaning and touch ups!
4.0,"Nice looking pants, very funky! Waist is a bit tight, for the size.<br />However it arrived stuck in a package so small that even with a iron I can't get rid of all the wrinkles. And these pants are not easy garment to iron!"
4.0,"I read all the reviews and saw the pics. I believe it has copper, registration cards etc.  Frankly I don‚Äôt care which copper company makes it. This mask is the best mask I have. HOWEVER, I am a grown female person with a SMALL FACE.  I truly don‚Äôt see how this mask could fit a full grown man. When I opened it, it looked so small, I didn‚Äôt think it would fit. But, it worked out."
4.0,Pretty top for the price.
4.0,"I was looking for an outfit to comfortable exercise, this shirt did not disappoint"
4.0,The skirt is very cute and soft but the material is very thin and Raggy it came out of the package all wrinkly and very thin material it‚Äôs not great quality
4.0,I really am pleased with this set of prayer beads. They are just the right size to fit over my hand and onto my wrist. The texture of the beads is very nice as well. The only reason I removed a star is the beads are all the same size; knots are used for the cruciform beads which I didn‚Äôt notice until they were in my hands.
4.0,"Dress was very flattering and soft. Could be dressed up or worn casually. Loved the style and look, perfect for fall."
4.0,"Too small, but it is a very nice quality dress."
4.0,"Love! Great quality and very flattering. Runs on the larger size. If you‚Äôre in between sizes, definitely  size down. I‚Äôm returning for a smaller size."
4.0,She lives it
4.0,"It didn‚Äôt take at least a month for shipment to deliver, the seller is actually in the United States but received it‚Äôs products from China. The mask üò∑ fits pretty okay on my face, reasons for the one star short is because not every one of the face mask fits the same, one mask could fit well but another mask could be loose fit, I would have to try to stretch fit the mask apart so to keep the pocket lining in the mask from plugging up my nose as I try to breathe, since I‚Äôm a deep breather. If anyone of the ten mask come out a bit loose I could just tie a knot on the earlobe lubes‚Ä¶but in any case‚Ä¶it is wreath the money in buying the mask."
4.0,Great maternity dress. The line cuts right above the bump. Very flattering and fits great. Medium worked perfect for me and I'm 34DD. Needs washed before you wear because the fabric needed softening.
4.0,love the dress but it is tooooooooo long - titled mini dress but it is knee length -  not what i was looking for.
4.0,Nice feel and look for the price.
4.0,"The lightweight, all seem to fit right, but all 6 are different sizes"
4.0,"I've had these sox for almost 2 months and so far I'm pleased.  They are probably not medical grade compression sox but they are still pretty tight and control my edema wonderfully.  Since I have a 37 inch inseam, I was surprised that they fit my entire calf up to the bend of my knee.  They might be too long for someone with shorter legs.  Other medical grade sox I've had in the past cost 3 - 4 times as much, tended to rip after a while and were so difficult to get on that I didn't wear them much.  Not so with these.  They haven't ripped and are much easier to get on.  I wear them every day."
4.0,they were a gift for my son and he said that he likes them
4.0,I love the boots  They fit pretty good.
4.0,"I really love this item.  It futfill my expectations! !. And the price is great good looking chain and quality.  I do really recommended,  no one would be disappointed. For sure you'll received a lot of compliments."
4.0,"Giving 4/5 on this pair because they weren't close to the same color as the picture posted, they are more like navy blue where u see the bright blue in the picture and black in the other places. That is ok though i like the designe and pocket layout is so nice, the zippers give a little added piece of mind ur stuff isnot just gonna fall out depending if u are using them to be active or not.  I will be using them for flow art performances, and am very excited"
4.0,The pictures and description of the product showed an elastic waist pants. What showed up was drawstring pants. I tried to make it work but the drawstring was either constantly falling down or cutting into my skin. I then contacted Ultimate Fighting Gear and they offered to send me elastic waist pants for free. The elastic waist pants were nice but not the same 100% heavyweight cotton construction (the only reason this is not 5 stars).<br /><br />Overall I'm impressed with the quality of everything I received. It's much better quality and fit than the free uniform I was provided at my TKD school.
4.0,The jacket was slightly small and thinner than expected by my girl loves it!
4.0,Like the shirt but sizes seem to run small
4.0,"Price was right, but the quality has gone down since the last time I bought this shirt."
4.0,Liked the bag
4.0,"These running pants are comfortable and feel cool with a breeze. They do fit a little bit on the smaller size. But not too much, only in the junk area, so it can cause some stares at times. Other than that, I would recommend!"
4.0,Too small but made well
4.0,"Good lenses, fit as expected."
4.0,It was very cute. It runs a size or 2 too small. So this won't fit her next year.
4.0,"I like the ring, too bad no paper was included to tell what the colors meant regarding your mood"
4.0,"BUREI Women‚Äôs 13002-LH Watch<br /><br />I should begin by saying that I received this product at a discount for a review. I agree with other reviewers as to the presentation of the watch. Once you get the package, you feel like you purchased a very fancy watch ‚Äì which is true. The package comes with an elegant gift bag, the watch encased in a suede pillow, owner‚Äôs manual, warranty card, and a free gift (in my case, I got a fancy hair clamp). I rate them highly on presenting the watch in a very nice way. However, since we are not here to talk about the packaging, let me focus on the main attraction ‚Äì the watch.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful ‚Äì especially the rose-gold watches. I love watches, and this won my heart. It has a standard adjustment dial on the side of the watch to set the time. According to the manual, the watch is a 30M which means that it has some level of water-resistance to it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you would necessarily want to go scuba diving with it. I love the red and blue nylon strap; it looks like you can easily clean they should they begin to look dirty.<br /><br />If they could change one thing, I‚Äôd suggest they elongate the strap a bit. I have larger wrists, and this watch fit just OK, but it didn‚Äôt leave a little wiggle room to rotate freely around my cuff. Nonetheless, I will keep wearing this watch.<br /><br />All in all, this is a lovely, decent watch and ‚Äãhas a lot of value in it. I recommend this piece to anyone, especially if you like what you see.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review. Let me know if you have any questions regarding the item and please give me a helpful vote if this was useful to you."
4.0,Love it and fits my wrist perfectly.
4.0,"I absolutely adore this necklace. Every time I wear it, I receive numerous compliments. It is slightly longer than I expected, but it is still one of my favorite pieces of fashion jewelry. The only problems I have with it is the outside pearl twists upside down, the bow is black and much smaller, and it is difficult to put on by yourself. It is adorable, especially for the price!"
4.0,"These are easy to slap on when rushing out the door.  However, have had the watch face pop out of the silicone wrist casing and fall to the floor.  Luckily, it didn't damage the watch itself when hitting."
4.0,"I have really sensitive ears I suppose. The 14k white gold earrings in my second lobe piercing was irritating my ear. I put a pair of these in, and in just the few days I have had them in, my ears feel much better. No more redness and very little pain. I'm guessing that it will only keep improving. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I only left 4 because when the earrings arrived one of the posts had separated from the earring. Luckily it was on the biggest set which I probably wouldn't have worn a lot anyways."
4.0,Really liked the bra. The only thing on it is the zipper will scratch you on the bottom.  Needs a small piece of material over it. It's where it connects on the bottom.  Other than that it's a great bra. Will definitely buy again.
4.0,They are a bit small but very durable and stretchy
4.0,It fits well and it is warm enough.
4.0,"I was wanting to try something besides a mask because the masks were hurting my ears so I wanted to try one of the neck gaiters.  I have heard that gaiters do not protect as well against spreading droplets, but I will say it is more comfortable.  Something is also better than nothing in my opinion.  Super easy to put on and super comfortable, just slide it over the head.  Sometimes the gaiter would slip down, it might depend on your head size."
4.0,"These are REAL 9mm Luger shells ... minus the primer and powder, of course.  I think they're absolutely great ... and I wear my 9mm earring on those &#34;special occasions,&#34; like last month's gun show.  Nonetheless, I have to give them a 4- instead of 5-star rating because they're so heavy that my poor left ear (I'm a guy with just the one lobe pierced) is begging for relief after just a couple hours of being pulled on.  Even though it would have detracted from the authenticity of this piece, I kinda wish that the manufacturer would have opted for a plastic replica bullet instead of this real deal 115-grain RN-CP.  One thing for sure: You don't forget that you're wearing this baby!  It swings around and bops you on the side of the noggin with every twist of your head.  With most earrings (and I have dozens), I don't even know that I have them on ... till I catch them on a piece of clothing and get a taste of the OUCH!"
4.0,Very nice product but need more c.c. slots
4.0,It is fine just a sleep bra nothing really special but what I wanted.
4.0,"I really like these but not sure why they have thick in their name because they are not, also the backs of these are really tiny so I used others that I have but having said that I really do like the look!"
4.0,Super comfy. I wear them all the time.
4.0,Runs like a half size small..
4.0,"Not sure they are authentic, beautiful appearance."
4.0,I love this thing it's so goofy looking and makes me wanna fight Arnold Schwarzenegger
4.0,I like the color and fix nice
4.0,Very cute top.  fabric is a little clingy but not too much.  I like the ties on the side
4.0,Not Cotton whatsoever. I repeat NOT COTTON
4.0,"Smaller than expected, tight fit."
4.0,"Love the magnetic bracelet, but had to give it a 4 star rating because one of the magnets fell out. Great color. You do need to be careful when removing all the time. The shape does tend to get distorted, but easily fixable."
4.0,"Bulkier than expected, but beautiful! I love it!"
4.0,The top was just a little small
4.0,This NERLEROLIAN Women's Summer V Neck Strappy Tank Top is a very flattering top. It shows off cleavage perfectly and has enough space near those problem areas- aka the stomach and hips. A very classy looking top for a night on the town.<br /><br />Katiebabs
4.0,"Not top of the line, but a basic pocket watch. Very nice for the price and a decent chain also."
4.0,Great material  Very flexible.
4.0,"These are really cute, but they are a bit flimsy and don't do a great job blocking the sun."
4.0,Great sweat shirt. Well made. Medium weight. My husband loves them.
4.0,Beautiful ring..happy I am
4.0,"This is very nice scarf and hat set. Good quality, warm and not scratchy. I just wish different colors were available."
4.0,Pretty nice glasses but they look too plane workout a brand logo. It actually says China üòè
4.0,For the Price it will work for the night!!!
4.0,"I was worried last night when I first got it, since it feels a little thin, but I decided to give it a shot anyway, and it was surprisingly warm on my way into the office (low to mid 20s, VERY windy, and snowing).  So my primary concern (is it warm enough for winter in Upstate NY?) and secondary concern (is it cute and a little funky?) are both dealt with beautifully - the answer is yes to both.<br /><br />I have a few minor issues with it though (thus the 4 stars)..<br /><br />The belt is a little slippery, so comes undone unless it's tied twice (the second is a slip knot so it can be untied).<br /><br />It is a tiny bit tight in the shoulders, not HORRIBLY, but if you've got muscular arms, or wear big bulky clothes? Go up at least a size.  If you're just wearing tops and blazers, you'll be fine, but.. more than that would be problematic.<br /><br />The inside is a bit scritchy, which is sad given how amazing the outside feels.  I tried it on last night with a 3/4 length sleeve shirt and the area where it was touching my skin was very irritating.  For wearing it to work that isn't a a problem, since I wear blazers every day, but.. For dresses and going out it could be uncomfortable, depending on the style of dress.."
4.0,This dress is really pretty I ordered S is a little loose like the picture is nice the only complaint about it is the smell was really bad I have to put it in water white suavitel for a 30 minutes and the smell go away  I prefer to watch because the price was just $11
4.0,"It's pretty and looks like the photo but I wish the chain were a bit shorter so it wouldn't hang as low. The &#34;dot&#34; flips over and doesn't lay flat. I think if the chain were shorter it would keep it from doing that, but it's a nice necklace especially for the price."
4.0,We ordered as mother's day gifts for both my mom & MIL; both expressed happiness and pleasure at the gifts. Pretty without being gaudy.
4.0,Very thin and mostly polyester but still nice looking.  My issue was the button holes were closed so I had to cuT them open myself. They also don‚Äôt go up all that high in the waist. The model must be less than 5 ft tall.
4.0,It fits true to size. Somewhat of a spandex/polyester feel.
4.0,Nice leather but not enough card slots and no coin area. Returned.
4.0,Have purchased the same dress before fit and looks great. The ones I just got are the same size but smaller. The waist is higher. I can pull it down a few inches and wear a belt. Love how they flare out and sway.
4.0,These are nice socks not the highest quality or thickness in material but nice socks. You get what you pay for and I am happy with this purchase. I have a size 14 shoe but these fit fine.
4.0,Mine fall off a lot.  Maybe it‚Äôs just me not getting them attached securely
4.0,Love the fit. Only unhappy about the bottom being tangled. Easy fix.
4.0,Fits as expected and really beautiful. Light and Thin. I found the tying strip a little short but still able to be tied.
4.0,"nice looking, sturdy pleasure boots. they are not work boots at all, but I like them. they go well with my prosthetic boot"
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my friends 40th.  It was nice for the price, but a little hard to stretch to get your hand in.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
4.0,"Fuzzy warm socks, actually bought for an 8 year old. She loved them however after a few washes they break down a little bit."
4.0,Very pretty. Cups were a little weird for me
4.0,These earrings are so cute and tiny but fit really nicely in the ear.
4.0,"Got this for a birthday present, it was very pretty"
4.0,"These glasses are pretty good over all! I love the heart shape I have been looking for a pair like these for a long time, they are a little to big for my face. Also they don't block the sun very well but you can tell there is a difference. Last I have seen that they tend to bend by the nose so I have been very careful with them. I think these are great I'd recommend you to try them out!"
4.0,"Turns out I don't need the extra inches, but I like the way the belt feels. It's too wide for anything but jeans. This is a serious flaw, in my opinion. Even your belt loops measure 1.5"", remember the belt and the buckle has bulk. Like the way the belt looks, but almost returned it."
4.0,Very cute dress. Runs a little small.  Dress is extremely long.  I'm 5'3&#34; and could easily get 3 or 4 inches cut off and re-hem it.  Thin and comfortable.  Great for summer.  Would order another if they had more colors available.  Received it way sooner than expected.
4.0,These look great so far. Just hope the quality doesn‚Äôt diminish after only a few times of wearing them.
4.0,"Cute casual dress made of quality material that isn‚Äôt see through, like many are. The length hits right at the knee. If wanting a more snug fit you may need to go down a size because this is a baggy fit dress with a lot of room for give."
4.0,Nice but tarnished within two weeks
4.0,"Pretty but metal for nose piece is flimsy and seems like it would come through the fabric easily, because it's a thin wire. Other than that, I like it."
4.0,"Well made, nice material and color. Great fit."
4.0,fits nicely
4.0,"The mask fits my face pretty well. I wear a medium size motorcycle helmet, so I'm guessing my face is probably about average size. The mask material is thick enough that it would help keep your face warm in cold climates, but its still breathes fairly well. The only thing is that the face picture on the mask seems a little too large, so it doesn't look quite right."
4.0,"Good quality. Far better than I expected. However, I do have a few issues with the costume.<br />1. The thigh holster. It is HUGE. It has elastic so it *should* fit, but there is far too much elastic. I have to safety pin or cut the elastic and sew it to make it smaller.<br />2. The top. It's only one piece, which ia fine by me. But, it is cut very tight in the underbreast area. It fits fine on the breasts, but the area right underneath, where your ribs are and there isn't much fat, is tight.<br />3. The pants are very cute and fit perfectly in the waist. They are pretty long, but since I'm short I expect this and don't worry about it. I will be wearing knee high boots, so no one will see the length.<br />Overall, the costume is cute and well made. For the price I paid and how often I will be wearing it, it's good. I would buy it again, but I think I would go up a size."
4.0,"Cute dress. Nothing fancy, but has pockets and is comfortable. I am under 6ft and I wish it were a little longer but it will work."
4.0,"Cute little beads. Worked great for our team soccer bracelets! I wish that the threading loop was vertical to the pendant so that it would lay flat, but overall it was a good purchase."
4.0,Description was spot on. They also are decent quality for the price.
4.0,"Ok, I got these quickly and they are all of 2 inches wide.  I like that.  They hold up my pants which is sort of required in our society.  The one minor issue is that the adjusters will NOT stay where I put them.  I have to constantly adjust them to keep the suspenders tight!  It's not big deal as I will just get a couple of safety pins and  pin the adjusters  to where I want them.  I  have this trouble with all suspenders that are belt clipped.  I wear suspenders due to a back issue. I can get by with belt alone, but I have to keep it too tight and that is uncomfortable as the belt presses against my back..painfully so.  I have a degenerative disease so it will only get worse.  I can keep the belt looser and  use suspenders which solves the problem.  I l like the belt clips since other types of clips just tear  up my pants.<br /><br />Bottom line, good sturdy suspenders..all of 2 inches wide.  I hope they last awhile as I would like to get some more!  Just wish the adjusters would stay where I put them..."
4.0,"Nice, but blue in bottom glass bead is not matched well with crystal bead on top. The top bead looks more teal, than blue."
4.0,"They are well-made, and have an ajustable fit feature. Thanks!"
4.0,"I am 5'1"", 103lbs, 32D and this fits great. I have not tried it in the water yet but amazing to buy wetsuit off the web. Note: can tell that it is not thick enough for really cold water but hopefully good for my needs."
4.0,Good value if you're into this sort of thing. I am.
4.0,"I am nearly 40 years old and something I jokingly pride myself on is that I never have stinky feet. Like ever. But these changed that. I wear them as I have worn my Isotoner house ballet slippers for years, thinking they‚Äôd provide more support. I was wrong in that front. They are super comfy but at what cost? I have sprayed them with odor eating stuff .... I have aired out the removable insoles... I have scrubbed my feet before putting them on. Doesn‚Äôt matter. They start smelling again. So back to my trusted ballet slippers.  Sob"
4.0,A bit on the heavy side.
4.0,My Grand-daughter loves the all-black set I bought her.  So I am ordering two more in different colors.  I just hope the skirt twirls and fits like the black set I bought her.
4.0,"I like the fact that it fit great and stylish, also comfortable and has always fast shipping!!!"
4.0,very comfortable and good during the winter season.
4.0,Goo bathing suit for the price. Perfect for a modest look. Fit is true to size.
4.0,This piece is amazing. I have received numerous compliments.  The only downside is that I find the black strings in my path.
4.0,"These slipper socks are cute and toasty. I gave them 4 stars though because they are a little big. That being said, I only wear around a size 6.5. I wear them with regular socks & fold over the cute leggy part that should go over your calves and they‚Äôre ok. But they still want to slip off. They‚Äôre just too baggy in both the foot & leg. I think if you wore at least a size 8 or 9 &/or had wide feet they would fit better."
4.0,"So far, this bag is very good for traveling light. No tears, material appears strong. I've only used it once though so cannot give a comment over longevity."
4.0,"this jacket was expensive but it was less expensive than the other version.  that was my only negative comment.  It will serve as a raincoat for my daughter for a few years and it will do the job.  The hood, zipper, and snaps are good quality, but the material is thin, so you will need to wear a sweatshirt under it if you have cold weather.  For size comparison, my daughter wears a child's size 12--this jacket was big for her, but not ridiculously so--we had to roll the sleeves up a little. If you have a daughter who wears a 12 to 18 girls/youth, then this jacket would fit them.  As far as I could see, this jacket only comes in adult sizes, so if you have a girl that wears at least a 12, then you should be able to get away with buying her the adult XS."
4.0,"For fishing in the summer and the winter, this product is great. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is there is no banding in the sleeves. Also would like to see this product made in toddler sizes."
4.0,washed twice & faded but over all good
4.0,"Very nice bracelet. One of the strands broke as I was trying it on. Didn't care much, the pretty ones stayed on. Overall I like it"
4.0,"Not as hefty as I expected, but worth the price. Did get one size larger, that works."
4.0,Have bought many colors and love
4.0,Nice color. Fit well. I ordered xl it fit well but I thought was mire like a sweater. I returned.
4.0,"The sizing instructions were a bit obtuse, but a quick study of the product made that part obvious and easy to complete.<br />The open / close function takes a bit of getting used to, but again quite easy to manage.  Belt looks good, and the quick adjustability is really nice.  This is the first product of this type I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to any competitor.<br />Bottom line is that I like it."
4.0,Fits as expected. My husband liked me in the dress. Bought the pink can‚Äôt wait for spring/summer.
4.0,Absolutely loved it so much that I ordered another one for a back up
4.0,Super cute nice color
4.0,The tshirt material is nice with some stretch. Fits as expected. It is longer than picture shows. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it hangs below my thighs. I‚Äôm keeping it to wear as a bathing suit cover up or a night shirt.
4.0,This watch is overboard lovely!  Easy to read for my aging eyes and extremely expensive looking.  I would have kept it and gave it a full 5 stars but it is an overseas Seiko product so Seiko USA does not carry the links for lengthening the band.
4.0,"They do run a tad bit small, order up at least one size"
4.0,A little bit snug
4.0,Started to unravel after I took it off the first time otherwise very nice product.
4.0,My hubby has been looking everywhere for a belt like this!  Just told me today how much he likes it!!
4.0,"I love the shirt, the color is beautiful, I would get all of them but I don‚Äôt like the pictures on the front of the other ones.  I didn‚Äôt like the length of the sleeves so I cut them off and hemmed them to fit my short arms and am going to make a matching mask."
4.0,Perfect for a school drama.
4.0,Great value. Good quality.
4.0,Fairly comfortable. Stretchy but soft and durable.
4.0,Dress is super cute. However the skirt material is a bit stiff and darts in the cut make the skirt stick out more than I'd like. Otherwise very cute.
4.0,"Its a great product. The way it feels is amazing, the different stones give it more style. But I was looking a male to pray or meditate, so if you're looking for something this is not the right one, is a good piece of jewelry and looks amazing on the first, It has 126 beads so it pass the 108 beads, when set on the wrist looks a perfect size, but the beads are too many, if it could have the 108 beads it could be more useful, but if you want to have something different and unique, you could order this one, the string doesn't feel so durable, it seems to thin. I hope this last a little bit more with the usage, but lets see what happen."
4.0,Thanks! replaced a broken band....works great!
4.0,"Great set of socks and the presentation is perfect for a gift. These are lightweight and perfect for warmer weather. I wear a size 12 and they fit great. Since they are on the thin side, not sure yet on the durability."
4.0,"My son is 2.5, but wears 4T-5T. These gloves are unfortunately small for him. But for average size kids, they should fit fine until the age of 4, as advertised."
4.0,"nice jacket, but I would have bought a large if I knew they aren't true to size"
4.0,"I am large busted - so it stretched quite a bit at the top and felt like the color/print stretched a lot, not enough to be see through, but just something to know. Otherwise very comfortable, hits me at my knees. Cute dress"
4.0,A little wide on the bridge but it's okay
4.0,"I would prefer it a touch smaller,  but overall it got really well. The ruffles are flattering and thinning,  I got lots of compliments."
4.0,Nice belt. Attached easy.
4.0,Really cute little things. I will have to find someone with much smaller ears though.
4.0,light weight and breathable. needs readjustment after sliding it off and on a time or two but at least it doesnt errode my flesh like the band that came with my watch
4.0,"Looks much bigger in pic, probably my fault for not reading the dimensions. Too small for the school pack I wanted for my son but is perfect sized for a first aid kit so we kept it. On a good note, it is rock solid and will last years."
4.0,"My wife is always misplacing/loosing her glasses/sunglasses pouches. The work as suitable economical replacements. The quality on these aren't particularly high, however for the price you pay for the set they're more than worth it."
4.0,Wish the shorts were just a bit longer.
4.0,"They are very nice, just like I was looking for but does not have a musical chime sound I hoped for. Very happy with them."
4.0,The pants we're way too long.I am not 6'4..
4.0,I'm thoroughly surprised with this purchase! I'm chesty and got a medium and it fit great! Full coverage of my chest. The bottom came up a little but it's fine by me! A little cheek on the bottom is never bad! The waist is the only problem I had. It doesn't sit close to the body of you have a small waist.  Color is perfectly purple! Will be ordering in other colors! I orders a medium and am 5'4&#34; 150 34DDD
4.0,It took me a little while getting used to the mask. I have very mild asthma. Learning to breath differently.
4.0,nice and a bit different in a good way
4.0,This item was cool! I think I may get another one. The price was more then fair! Icp got lots of things by them.
4.0,Not too big the way I like it but enough to be noticed
4.0,"I'm gonna be honest, I'm enough of an exhibitionist that I wish I had the body to wear this with nothing but pasties underneath.<br /><br />First off, keep in mind that this is ""kimono print"", whatever that means. It is in no way, shape, or form a kimono; it comes just about to the waist, so, you know, wear pants or something. Big Farrah hair and sky-high heels would be a nice accessory as well. It just ties in the front, and it should fit you unless you're really tall. It's not 100% my style, but it's a nice addition to my closet and maybe I'll find something to wear it with this summer."
4.0,Can't do as many styles as shown. Light weight. Pretty print. Knee length.
4.0,"My wife really likes this studs set as they are well made, offer a good variety of choices in terms of colors and size that should go with most everyday wear<br /><br />- Comes with 2 pairs each of black, sliver and gold plated studs with round and square imitation diamond inserts and then three pairs of black, silver and gold plated studs with a slightly larger round stone insert<br />- They are well made and easy to put on and take off<br />- The stoppers have a notch in them that provides some resistance while removing it, this prevent accidental opening while wearing them<br />- Very lightweight<br />- My wife reported no skin irritations or reactions while using them all day long<br />- Comes wrapped in individual plastic wrappers and a velvet drawstring pouch for easy storage<br />- Stoppers are inter-compatible with each other,  so even if you loose one , you can use the ones from others<br />- The imitation diamond quality is good and they do sparkly nicely under proper lighting<br /><br />Overall this is a very decent set that goes with almost all daily wear styles and it is inexpensive as well as you get a lot of different studs/styles for the money . My wife definitely recommends them"
4.0,"These cuffs look great on my ears, just as I expected,  but they would fall off when I used my cell phone.  I ordered two and have already lost one, I have to be aware of them when Im wearing them because you dont even feel them on."
4.0,"I just received this apple watch band. I like better this clasp rather than the butterfly clasp, it is easier to put one. Package is well wrapped and comes with multiple tools: wipes (2), band adjustment tool with extra tip (2) in case the original break and the band. The color of the band &#34;black&#34; is not so much a black but more a charcoal brushed color. I bought for my gold apple watch serie 1 and I would say it looks pretty good. I think a solid &#34;dark&#34; black would have looked better but I think the brushed color will last longer (especially for scratched). Very easy to remove the band adjustment. I removed too many and was able to add one more after, no problem. The weight is quite &#34;heavy&#34; and change completely the feeling of the watch after. Some people like that I think it will just take me a few days before I don't notice it anymore. For the quality of the stainless steel, I would say it is fair quality. I really don't think the color will last too too long (one year or two) before the charcoal color fade and starts to turn redish. I can see already some color differences in the edges between two adjustments in the band. For the price, what would you expect I guess.<br />Buy with confidence. Shipped by Amazon and was there as planned, on time. Would buy again another color to complete my collection. Cheers."
4.0,Attractive looking but light. Wife likes the bracelet but under-estimated the cost.
4.0,"Like it a lot, 4 stars and not 5 because cards stick and a little bulky.  But use it everyday, and will be using for a while."
4.0,Good shoes and as expected good quality!
4.0,Nice hat for casual wear.
4.0,Love it! Very stylish.
4.0,"I like the color, the print, & that the fabric is what I expected."
4.0,"I'm a petite woman, about 5'2&#34; and 117 pounds. I normally wear a size small, but since this was made overseas, I ordered a size bigger since they tend to run smaller overseas. I bought this dress in a chocolate brown and gray, both in size Medium. The brown fit very snugly and the gray was too large. If you can get one that actually fits you right, it's adorable, and looks great with boots."
4.0,"Really awesome shirt! Being in a band, I plan on wearing this on stage. My drummer got one too but his was a little wide (he got a medium he is 6'0 and slim) while my shirt fit perfectly (I'm 5'10ish and slim I got a small) so think about that. I love this shirt and I love Regular Show. I recommend this to anyone else who does too."
4.0,I would have given them 5 stars cause they work very well at night and on overcast days even better than the yellow kind but they break easily on the nose bridge. Yeah I know they're cheap enough to buy another pair but wish they were at least a thicker plastic. Be really nice if they had them in a metal frame.
4.0,Comfortable and relaxed look
4.0,Love the Teal color. The sleeves are a bit longer than expected but feels and fits great.
4.0,"My first impression upon opening this is that it is a good product and it turned out nice; however, the writing on the back that I requested via the order was not what I received. I took a picture when I placed the order to verify when I received it. The writing I received was not bad, but what I requested was what I really wanted for a specific reason. Other than the incorrect writing, it seems to be a good product to purchase."
4.0,Great traction and my 4yr old son loves em and can put them on easily himself. They are really flexible which to me seems like they wont last but other than that they dont seem of low quality.
4.0,Sturdy. Increases the visibility of ones luggage substantially.
4.0,These boots were sent to great-grandchildren in another state.  I have not received any feedback from the children's parents.  I'm sure the boots were fine.
4.0,"I am a size 4, 5'8&#34; tall, about 135 lbs. This dress fit me really well. The neck was a little too loose, but had i ordered a small instead of a medium, the waist would have been too tight for me. Everyone complemented me. Love it!"
4.0,"I got this because my original strap ripped after a couple of weeks at the point where the pins connect it to the watch face.. Not good, since I work with squirmy animals. I hope this one is more durable, but I won't get my hopes up.<br /><br />The red is more of a deep rosy pink, and I had been expecting red-red. Maybe it's just mine, since dark pink doesn't seem to be a colour they have. Next time I'll try royal blue, or go back to black, since i'm not crazy about this shade."
4.0,Could be just a little thicker metal but item is exactly as described. Nice wide opening
4.0,"I ordered the keychain, so all my keys would be in a central location.<br />Some of the pros include:<br />many slots for keys<br />Cute design<br />Easy to snap<br /><br />The only con is that I broke the clip on accident flipping my windshield wipers on; while it was my fought, I would have hoped the key ring a little sturdier.<br /><br />I would recommend & purchase again."
4.0,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the part of the strap after the buckle sticks out. Wish they put a loop there to hold it down, like on belt."
4.0,So cute!! Cut is so different!
4.0,They are good enough for the price. I wore them with my halloween costume and had no problem  with it.
4.0,"Wow ... this is a great Fez Hat. I don't know when I will be able to use it, probably for Halloween party.  But the material is super. It is soft and well made. The size is more for woman or kid. But since it is a custom item, I guess it does look funny when a men wear a tiny fez hat.<br /><br />** This product was received either at no or low cost for review purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. **"
4.0,"These are a good buy. Easy to use, they don‚Äôt rust easy"
4.0,"Bought these to get free shipping on an item. They don't have aggresive side cuts for kicking, but my mobility really isn't hindered much by them either. Large waist band too if that's a big deal to anyone. Worth what I paid for them and I like the styling so I'd buy again."
4.0,"This is a really great dress - the design is great. You'd think the bodycon style and the grid style wouldn't be a good combination, but I think they really work. The blue grid lines look really nice against the pink too.<br /><br />It is true to size IF you follow the size chart. If you're going by &#34;your size&#34;, order a size up. But really, just follow the size chart. For reference, I'm 34-31-37 and a large works beautifully on me.<br /><br />The fabric is thin and stretchy, but super comfortable - a lot like a bathing suit, actually. You can see in the photo that you can see bra lines through it, and it will show off any tummy you might have. I'll probably wear it with a slip or something just to be safe. I would love to see this made of a thicker material to help avoid lines and smooth things out a bit - I have a different bodycon dress that does an AMAZING job with this. Still, I really like the look of the dress, and for the price I think it's a really nice dress. I didn't notice anything looking too see through, which is good as well.<br /><br />I think it's going to make a great presentation dress when I pair it with my navy blue blazer - no need to leave it just for a night out, this can definitely be made office appropriate with a blazer or cardigan, though the blazer will probably look best since the fabric will match better. It helps a lot that it's not overly short - in fact, it's barely above knee on me.<br /><br />Overall, really fantastic design and pretty nice dress overall. I'd pay full price anywhere in the $15-$25 range, and probably a bit more if the fabric was thicker and smoothed a bit better.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."
4.0,Product is nice . I‚Äôm glad I ordered a large I normally wear a medium but large fits great . The material is super soft . And the color is very accurate. I‚Äôm glad I purchased.
4.0,"Thick and comfy, good for hiking. Wish they have more color choice."
4.0,It's useless it's not a jacket nor a custom...... but it looks nice..... feels awful..... made of spandex
4.0,Slightly shorter than I thought but I still like it. Fits nice and I love the color (red).
4.0,"Bought the sunflower headband with the 5 larger sunflowers. It fits well and looks great- just as pictured. The sunflowers are big and noticeable, but not so large to where it looks funny. It is the perfect accessory to my sunflower Halloween costume."
4.0,"Perfect fall flannel, its not super bulky. Not quite a slim fit, in between slim and standard size so cant give it a perfect rating. Im going 4.5 as it is quite comfortable at a great price. Def recommend. Would like to see some more color options available in the future!"
4.0,I sized up and got a large I usually wear a medium. Love this! Just wish it was sweat resistant
4.0,Love this necklace. very pretty and good quality for the price.
4.0,"Nice, great quality."
4.0,Nice for the price. Roomy with a nice texture to the PU leather.
4.0,SO CUTE! The picture is accurate!! I ordered a large in hopes that it would give it a bit more length when usually I would order a medium (a little frustrated that all the dresses I've ordered (and returned) have been too short to be a long dress and too long to be a shorter dress). I was so happy when I put on this dress because it was really long - but the dress itself was too big. I'm returning it and ordered a medium instead. I hope the length is similar to the large.
4.0,The cat design is really cute. The card case fits my phone. It did not seem to stick as well as my old no brand one.<br />However so far so good.<br />Really is not useful for more than one card. Phone pocket is  stiff without any stretch to it. Case may soften with time but for now it holds either a card or an id but not both.<br />Like everyone else I bought this for the cute cat design and of course who doesn't love Kate Spade's products?  Anyway I will use it because the cat is so cute.
4.0,"I got the dark green one and I absolutely love it. It's soft and comfy, I can dress it up or down depending on what I'm doing."
4.0,I just think this boots is great.  I love them. ‚ù§
4.0,"It feels comfortable. I would wear it more with the flaps folded up so, I would be more satisfied if the seams were made for the flap to fold in place better to cut down the bulkiness at the seam.  Would make a good gift if that correction was made, in my opinion."
4.0,"Product arrived in fair shape, but much later than promised. Very disappointed and won‚Äôt be buying more from this seller"
4.0,Had to return it as it was small for me but great style
4.0,Not all hats are the same size but good quality otherwise.  Couple of hats were tight after 1 wash on my baby girl with HC of 16.5 in
4.0,These clips are beautiful and well made! They seem to stay in my baby's super fine straight hair pretty well. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the white felt backing is rather large and shows if you push the clip in from the front. Otherwise colors and size are awesome.
4.0,Verdict is still out on this top. Havent worn it yet.  It fits but there is a pocket space in from (guess torso not wide enough for it).  Will keep because if I go up another size it may be worse.  Will have to sew piece of elastic  near  underarm to give that extra cinch and fit.  Overall lovely top.  Cant wait to wear it on night out.
4.0,"This shirt fits just right almost borderline somewhat small, I cannot wear anything under it as it is a slim fit.  The mustard color is really unique and can be worn as casual or business casual.  The materiel is well made, but note it is very thin.  You will have to watch what bra you wear with this or layer it with a tunic or open sweater on top.  This is long sleeved, however, because it is so thin it really does not keep you warm, but makes this perfect for Spring and Fall wear.  It is comfy with a bit of stretch to it, I could wear it all day and not be bothered by it."
4.0,"Nice dress, but SOO much longer than I thought it would be. It went to the bottom of my calves. Seemed like a black version of the Amish dress. Has pockets though, so that was awesome.<br />I returned, because was way to long for me. I'm 5'4&#34; for reference ."
4.0,I like the shoes but the top stretched a little.
4.0,Great suit.  Would recommend it.
4.0,"It's the perfect size! About 2 1/2 inches for the fork. The chain is really long, but not a problem because you can choose another hole to clasp onto. I like to dress Disney themed at work sometime without going full costume. This was just what I needed to complete my outfit for Ariel."
4.0,"Very cute and well made. Tall girls be aware that this dress will be very short on you. I'm 5'10&#34; and around 180 lbs, I ordered the XL and it fits nice. It's hangs nice and blousy like the pictures imply. The only thing is that it is pretty short, so you'll want to wear some kind of bloomers or shorts under it just in case the wind kicks up. Overall I like this and would purchase again."
4.0,"I love the look of this watch, and the fact that I'll never have to adjust the time or buy a battery for it.  I have other Casios that are solar/atomic, as well as a Citizen Ecodrive, and love them all for that fact.  With as many watches as I own, including Brietling's, Rolex's, and Omega's, it's nice to not have to set some of them for DST or change the dates manually at the end of a 28 or 30 day month."
4.0,Its a pretty cool bracelet! The only bad thing I have to say is after wearing it in and loosing it up sometimes I bump stuff which makes the buckle come undone. Not very often but it does happen.
4.0,Good quality and nice item... SSM
4.0,Really cute and simple necklace for an owl lover
4.0,"This is a very attractive, flattering dress! Size up if you are large-chested."
4.0,"Very small, cute crossbody. The color is what I most like about it. Doesn't look cheap."
4.0,I really do like it. I also feel comfortable walking around without worrying it will fall off. I do feel like it's pretty big but to be fair I am very small.
4.0,The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the bow is SO thick and huge- it looks crazy. So I throw the bow down inside the pants and wear my shirts over the waistband.
4.0,"Nice material, fits nice! Would buy again"
4.0,The little baby kangaroo tail was unraveling when I took it out of the package and he wouldn‚Äôt stay in the pouch like I had expected. I was pregnant at the time however so my belly probably got in the way.
4.0,Read design the size needs to be more tighter
4.0,"These are almost perfect! Wonderful bright red color, very clear red, pleasingly round, and a nice size (the stones are about the size of dimes). I just wish they dangled. They‚Äôre very ‚Äústiff‚Äù and just hang with no movement. They‚Äôre still very pretty, though, and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments on them."
4.0,"Nice, but the sizes and expected length is not as described, shorter and smaller than actually sizes"
4.0,Very cute and great for the price!
4.0,product was absolutely beautiful.. purchased for my mom but it was a bit shorter only bc my mom is curvier but I love this and would purchase for myself
4.0,"Excellent hold, comfortable and bathroom convenient."
4.0,Don‚Äôt care for the material of it‚Ä¶may just remix it somehow
4.0,"It's a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures... I made the mistake of going by the color tone of the last picture, thinking it was more of a silver. It's definitely gold.. The necklace is well made; however, the chain is very long and that looks kind of silly. It's a very pretty necklace, just not what I thought it would be."
4.0,Love  this jacket! It is so comfortable and fits perfectly. It is very well made and the material soft. Wore it out on a cold winter night in NY and kept me warm and cozy
4.0,"Fits very small. I wear a L/XL, I ordered (and returned) the XL, XXL. They were out of stock on the XXXL.<br />Shirt looked great, light weight and fast shipping."
4.0,"I liked the coat; however I thought I had read a review that said it ran large.  I ordered a medium and it was a tad tight through the shoulders.  I could have made it work, but I would rather have it more comfortable and be able to wear bulking items under it.  The coat is cute, but I returned it."
4.0,Daughter really liked them but they were hard to put on and she was scared she would break them.
4.0,Pretty mocha color.  Had to go 4 sizes larger to get it to fit but very pleased with the results.
4.0,Just a little snug...
4.0,DECENT SOCKS THAT FIT MY SIZE 15 FEET PERFECTLY
4.0,The dress is absolutely stunning however with the back as open as it is it doesn‚Äôt stay in place well.
4.0,very cute but a little on the large side.
4.0,The band fit and works just could be much more comfortable and a little easier to use please!
4.0,This top is very cute but it‚Äôs too large and droopy for me
4.0,"Quality leather, very nice piece! I wish it were a bit thinner, but, really, it does fit my purse fine. My 33-yr old daughter, who's in  corporate business, thought it just perfect and I was being too picky."
4.0,Alittle tight but very cute dress
4.0,"My husband has an old vintage watch with a 19mm lug width. He's had trouble finding decent watch bands that fit and look good with it, and usually just squeezes in a common 20mm lug width strap. I wanted him to try out this BISONSTRAP Watch Strap with Quick Release, as it had a retro appearance and came in a variety of sizes including 19mm. Overall, he was very happy with this BISONSTRAP. The 19mm lug width band fit his watch perfectly, and the appearance of the band matched well with the vintage watch. He particularly liked the exposed stitching, which gave the band a more rustic appearance. The band is made of lightweight leather, but still feels sturdy and comfortable on the wrist. The band comes with quick-release spring bars so switching out watch straps is very convenient. Additionally, a spring bar tool was included, which came in handy when removing his watch's original band. This BISONSTRAP is also affordably priced. Given how difficult it has been to find decent 19mm watch straps, my husband is already considering ordering more of these in the other color options."
4.0,Fit as expected. Very cute
4.0,I love the dress just runs a little tight.
4.0,Looks sturdier than most wallet inserts I have used.  It certainly is larger than most and has by far more pockets than any I have used.  I may end up removing a couple of pockets that I do not use.  Good value!
4.0,Beautiful leaf detail.  Picture shows pink simulated Mother of Pearl.  Actual is more gray.
4.0,"These high waisted yoga pants are made from 78% polyester and 22% spandex. They have 2 side pockets in which a phone fits easily. It has a small hidden waist pocket for a debit care of keys. The hems, butt and crotch area are very well sewn and they are not thin so you cannot see through them even when bending over. They do have quite a bit of compression in the mid section area where I definitely need it. However somehow they just don't fit great. I am very curvy and they are snug but not over tight just fit odd. They are a good price coming in at just under $17 so that is a definite plus. A solid 4 star for price and being well made."
4.0,"Reviews were right, order a size up!"
4.0,I liked the lightweight material
4.0,"Incredibly pretty, definitely worth the price and would recommend to anyone wanting to buy a unique middle finger or thumb ring, I‚Äôve had previous resin rings like this for over a month and none broke so i got them in more colors, I would say they are somewhat true to size (?) easy to get on but a lil but of a struggle to get off"
4.0,Was a good choice
4.0,Love the look of this bracelet. Very substantial
4.0,I love the color. I like the length. It fits a tad tight in the arms.
4.0,"I bought this for a casual dress to go wedding dress shopping in, and I am SO pleased.<br /><br />The material is light and airy but with a good liner so it is not see-through. Although it is not necessarily stretchy, it has enough give that it doesn‚Äôt pucker in the chest, which I always struggle with with bigger gals.<br /><br />Also, the buttons are non-functional so there‚Äôs no gaping at ALL which is fantastic. The adjustable straps make it more customizable - esp bc I usually buy petite clothes.<br /><br />The *only* suggestion I have is if it had pockets lol.<br /><br />Overall, I will def be reusing this white dress for more bridal events and I will DEF be buying in more colors. Perfect for summer but I can also style with like knee high boots and a cardigan to take me into fall :)<br /><br />*edit: I did just steam it, and noticed a couple small light grey spots, likely dirt from when it was being packaged. Not a big deal and if it wasn‚Äôt white I likely wouldn‚Äôt have noticed - but taking off one star just because it‚Äôs technically not five star condition*"
4.0,"I like this ring, but the sides of it are a little sharp sometimes when I sit down.  Still, this wouldn't keep me from buying it.  Really like the look of it, it's slightly smaller than typical rings."
4.0,"Amazing length! I'm 5'9"" 195lbs and the XXL is juuuust off the floor. This is the first pair I've found with perfect length. I love the feel of the cotton fabric, but they justbdont have any flow to them, so the wide cut is unflattering on someone bigger (in my opinion). Waist is super comfortable and high rise (although no tummy control so I'd be wearing a shirt to cover it, even though it has nice stitching)."
4.0,The fabric is amazing absolutely love it but they do come smaller in sizes then usual so I would order two sizes up
4.0,"As with all the GM men's suits I've bought, great quality, fit and finish for the unbeatable price. This one fits me particularly well.  HOWEVER, I will be sewing the zipper shut after two very unpleasant incidents of the zipper slider bottom edge catching, well, um, delicate human flesh when being unzipped by me.  Given that some friends will likely think it is funny to try to unzip this as a joke, I won't be wearing it until I do sew the zipper shut.  :)"
4.0,It fit comfortably over nose & mouth. Washable.
4.0,I purchased the shirt for my husband. He hasn't worn it yet but he tried it on and it seems to fit well.
4.0,"The dress is very pretty.  It did have a few threads that need to be trimmed, but overall it was a nice dress.  I returned it because the underslip was sewn into the dress. I was looking for something with a detached slip so I could pair the over dress with whatever I chose."
4.0,"Very beautiful, well-made with the exception of back zipper, hence the four stars. It‚Äôs longer than expected.  For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and bought a size large.  It is tea length.  The dress appears to be much higher quality than the price reflects.  I plan to order in another color."
4.0,Works great! only complaint is the charge doesn't hold as long as a previous shoe we had like this bur the cord is hidden which I like and the other brand of shoe we had of these the cord was on th side and hung out a lot. My 3 year old son loves them!
4.0,"Pretty great length for my double pierced ears. They do slip, so the prior reviews about the clear plastic backings were extremely helpful. Really like them, but I wish the cube pendants were a tad bit smaller."
4.0,A product  that  helps you put your bracelet on
4.0,Decent material and kept me warm while outside giving candy to trick-or-treaters
4.0,"Works great for me on my daily commute. Two problems are that the left side appear to be a little bit quieter, and that overall the volume is not very impressive and I sometimes (not often) need to press it to my ear to overcome street noise.<br /><br />It also works pretty well as a phone handsfree with it's microphone - which was a great bonus!"
4.0,"Nice vest, good quality, light-weight, good fit, but I did order up one from XXL to XXXL.  The khaki was off-putting, so, returned for black.  I see a lot of posts about the zipper being on the wrong side.  It's not.  I have another vest I bought for $100 from England and I bought it in the Caribbean.  It is common for zippers to be in the same position.  Who cares.  It took me about a minute to get comfortable with zippers outside of the United States being on the opposite side.  Seriously, some people think it is a woman's vest, because the zipper is on the other side.  It's like the USA is still the only country that is not on the metric system, so the other countries are all wrong?"
4.0,"Pretty color, nice material"
4.0,Great socks. Too bad I only received 11 pairs out of 12.
4.0,Loved that it matched the bracelet I was planning on getting.
4.0,"I am very picky when it comes to the material of any type of leggings i purchase. I don't like when the material is flimsy, see through and does nothing for your figure so i'm always hesitate to buy online but decided to take the chance since returning things on Amazon is fairly easy and haven't had any luck at the stores.  I Just received these yesterday have to say love the feel of the material far from flimsy.  I tried them on and they feel really nice not tight on the waist at all which i was afraid they would be and the BIGGEST plus is that they aren't see through.  Gave it 4 stars only because i haven't worn them yet but looking to buy the gray pair also."
4.0,I love this dress however the sleeves were a little to loose but I still like it
4.0,I actually loved everything
4.0,Great quality. All around product.
4.0,The color of the romper is very pretty. Nice fit. But I noticed that there was a little rip in the back of the material. Not sure if I'm going to keep it because of the tear
4.0,"Elastic waistband and pockets make this an easy pull on choice.  The blue is not a dark navy so not easy to match but good with a coordinating top.  Rather long and I'm 5'7""."
4.0,Very pretty. I bought it as a gift.
4.0,"These are definitely shaped like joggers; they‚Äôre on the looser side, but it‚Äôs distinct. The bow belt is adorable and they fit VERY comfortably, and honestly, they‚Äôre pretty flattering, considering what they are. I would say they fit as expected or maybe even a smidge large.<br /><br />The only flaw for me is the ankles, but not for the same reason others have mentioned. In a pair of booties, it doesn‚Äôt matter and the jeans can give off such a nice, high-fashion appearance. But put on a pair of sneakers or flats and the elastic at the ankles suddenly makes it look like they‚Äôre grandma jeans. They give the ‚Äúneed to be baggy in the leg and cling to my dress socks‚Äù section of the department store where all the little old ladies can find them.<br /><br />The result is that the shoes you choose to wear with these COMPLETELY change the style/impression. They‚Äôre like denim sweatpants in regular flats, or date-worthy in booties/heels. It‚Äôs such a bizarre combination but I honestly wear them in both styles. I also wore them on an 8-hour plane ride and they were REALLY comfortable, so there‚Äôs that, too!"
4.0,"Would have rated higher but the skirt was bigger then expected. Would buy again, just size down."
4.0,"I've bought from this Kalon brand before and very pleased! I'm a full figure gal and they are very comfortable!! Length is great and doesn't bunch up requiring you to keep pulling them down. Don't  shrink. I usually wear them under my work scrubs, but nice to wear alone!! Highly recommend!! Will buy again!!"
4.0,"Mask does not adequately reach bottom of average chin. A better design would have perhaps another inch of height. Also, the metal band inside that can be bent to help seal leakage around nose is not secured inside the mask, allowing it st slide up and down and side to side, so it may require fiddling to get it into position when putting on mask. Overall, a nice mask."
4.0,Very nice watch. I do like the matching set a lot but I don't know if it's resizable or not. I tried taking out the pins in the links but I could not get them to budge. But overall still a cool and nice looking watching.
4.0,"I was SO scared to order this when I saw the reviews that it was way too small, but I wanted it bad enough that I took a chance. It turned out great! I got a large and it fits be great. I am about 5'2&#34; and 140 lbs and it fits me great. The only downside to this is that the breast pads are a bit too small and off when I wear it, so I might just have to go without."
4.0,Super ..!
4.0,"Ok so far. Waterproof, comfortable, cute‚Ä¶ fit a little big, kinda noisy and a bit overpriced."
4.0,Love the blue color!  Its a little big on me but I can roll up the sleeves and the extra space will allow me to wear it with my backpack.  I haven't worn it in heavy rain yet but the material seems like it will keep me dry.  I will pack it to take on a Disney trip to wear in case of rain.  It isn't small when folded in its pouch but that means it's more hardy than the baggie thick ponchos.
4.0,Loose fitting.  So comfortable I want more!
4.0,Quality pair for the price!
4.0,We had such issues with winter boots.  As we are in the muck a lot.  Finally a boot they can stay warm in and dry.  Easy on and off and easy to clean with fun colors.
4.0,Cant say. Had it returned.
4.0,"Boots are much nicer than I was expecting for the price. Fit true to size. Happy with my purchase. I wish they had my size, 8.5 in other colors."
4.0,"Love the quick release chin strap, but the inner screen visor is useless. If you have ever riden you know there are times you need a good sun screen and then at times not so the idea is great just has to be very sun proof. The helmet itself is also good looking. Just didnt want to have to try and shop around for a replace visor especially when I cant tell how dark it is so for the maker take one out side and look at the sun with it if you cant look then what good is it. Price also great but got to have dark visor. Have a few helments with outer dark visor but again at times that is to dark for some situation so you have to ride with it open. Not so nice noise or wind then."
4.0,I wore these boots for the first time today. They are quite comfortable and will be useful for winter weather.  I also like the fact that they are slip-ons.
4.0,"The dress is a gorgeous color and has great sparkle. It has good stretch and is not sheer. I love that the side without the shoulder is cut higher than most 1 shoulder dresses I've seen. The slit is very sexy! I am 5'1 and I love the length on this dress. I am wearing 5"" platform heels in the photo for reference."
4.0,Great looking shirt but I had to return it. I wasnt digging holes in the shirt. I did like the style and the soft fabric. Please dont design the shirt with holes in a big and tall shirt. It just dont look right on a big guy. If take the holes out will definitely buy because the shirt does look great.
4.0,These are a little bigger than I expected but still cute. The lenses feel like they might pop out easily but they havent yet so maybe not. I checked to make sure they are really polarized and they are.
4.0,Very nice bracelets. Bought for gifts.
4.0,My burgundy colored pair had a tiny hole in the middle of one leg. I sent message to the seller but it did not get resolved. Also the material is wonderful. It's thin but soft. My biggest issue is they fit great everywhere but the elastic is way too tight. It sucks into my stomach and the elastic folds itself over. It makes me look way fatter than well fitting elastic would. I might re-order in the future and get several sizes larger.
4.0,I like this hat. I just wish I could get it bigger as some people have big heads.
4.0,"The fabric, material, design was as expected and good quality. The fit was way bigger than the size chart indicated. I wanted to simply exchange the product for a smaller size but did not get an option to do that so I had to return it for a full refund."
4.0,very nice.  classic style.  simple true to size .  let's face it this is not high fashion but my granddaughter puts it on a lot under short sleeve uniform tops for warmth.  nice saturated color and easy wash/wear
4.0,Good quality. I love it.  But the sleeves are wierd
4.0,"Other than the stitching on the bridge of the nose being under-looked, it‚Äôs very comfortable and the designs were clearly sewn."
4.0,"My husband loves the, but I think they are a little too see through."
4.0,"A bit snug, but really not bad."
4.0,Works well with my touchscreen scan tool at work
4.0,Comfortable for cooler nights!
4.0,"These pants are cute and comfortable, they fit but I would like more stretch in the waist. Overall, it would just improve comfortability while wearing. Unfortunately, I don't reach for these as often because they are a little too snug compared to other pant options that I have. The waist band is elastic with drawstrings so I feel that they could be a little bit looser."
4.0,No me quedaron y los regale
4.0,"PHENOMINAL quality, especially considering the price!<br /><br />The only down side was the chain and clasp were broken on the choker with the Yin-Yang charm :(<br /><br />But the rest of them were in GREAT condition, this is definitely a purchase I did NOT regret!"
4.0,Should have checked the size at checkout. I had put medium in the product description. My fault oh well. The shipping was fast and shirt is very pretty.
4.0,This fit well except that the skirt top was a bit loose and didnt stay in place very well but still cute the material wasnt the beat but for the price I wasnt expecting anything nice.
4.0,"This is a little longer than I expected. It's a long chain that comes down to between my breasts. Also, the mirror fell out the first time I wore it. But a little glue fixed it up and I do still like the looks of it. The pendant itself is probably about and inch and a half to two inches long."
4.0,"This cat scarf is cute, but I thought it looked child-sized when I first saw it. It took awhile to figure out that the ribbed section above the cat head is a two-sided tube. The ball goes through the ribbed tube to secure the scarf. When worn this way, it does fit an adult snugly. The problem I have is that there is a defect on mine; one end of the ribbed tube is stitched closed with the tag. I will have to remove the tag so the tube is open."
4.0,Work very well with my prescription glasses for night driving.
4.0,Very cute. Didn't like the petty coat under it though.
4.0,I like it but the pins were a major pain to change but it was worth it love my new band
4.0,Very flattering but very long. I had to shorten it and I am 5f11
4.0,"I usually wear a XL in sport shirts, basketball shorts, board shorts, but in MMA shorts I need a 4XL and they're still kind of tight"
4.0,"For the price, it's good!"
4.0,My only complaint is maybe they could be a tiny bit smaller... Otherwise they're nice.
4.0,Very pretty necklace but was smaller than expected.
4.0,Very flattering top super trendy<br />Love the high low
4.0,Great watch except for the tiny band which barely fits around my wrist.
4.0,"Cool bracelet!  maybe not as 'soft' of a material as I would have hoped, but still very cool looking and easy to wear/take off."
4.0,I bought 2 of these hats for my kids who live in upstate New York. They were nice quality for the price. Good value.
4.0,These are not a thick heavy sock.  I love the bright colors.  They do not have a cushioned foot bed just a single thickness.
4.0,"These glasses are advertised as polarized, but when I put the glasses on and looked at the little card they send you that's supposed to show a different part of the picture with the glasses on I couldn't see any difference. According to that test, then no, these glasses aren't polarized as advertised.<br /><br />They do, however, reduce the glare from light sources when driving at night. My wife has super bad eyes and wears contacts. She can't hardly stand driving at night, but when she wears these it makes it tolerable.<br /><br />EDIT: The company reached out to me and suggested I use a different method to test whether these are polarized or not. I looked at an LCD screen with these glasses on and it does appear that they are polarized, but only slightly. So since they actually are polarized, I changed from 3 stars to 4 stars."
4.0,It would have been a 5 star review if it had fit. Unfortunately it was too small and had to be returned.  But the look and quality were excellent.
4.0,"We bought those for Halloween, they are a good size, we had plenty of room for candy hunt.."
4.0,Cute pieces. Good quality for the price. Washed well.
4.0,"I purchased this carry on because of the sizes posted. 17x10x9 which I need. The tag attached states an inch less if I don't expand the item which I can't due to strict air line policies. It's only an inch, but when you have a small carry on to pack and it's your only item allowed, you don't want to lose that precious inch of space. So, it isn't a 17x10x9 and should state so in the description, along with the sizes that it really is...Zipped in 17x10x8 and Zipped out 17x13x8. Unfortunately I have to use the zipped in size for this upcoming trip.<br />I had to cut the tag from the bag in order to open it to inspect it since it was connected to the zipper that opens the bag, yet your only given three working days from the receiving date posted to claim a free refund or call if you don't like it.<br />Maybe I will write another review after I pack the bag and see if it does what it's intended to do, but for now, it seems to be a good item. Just [pst the correct sizes!!  Thank you."
4.0,I like the warmest. I wear a size 5 so these are on the big size. Wish they had a size to fit me better.<br />It says size 5 to 6 1/2. That‚Äôs a BIG difference!!!
4.0,"beautiful detail on the sleeves, little bit small on my armpit but no enough to return it.."
4.0,a lot bigger than I thought but its really not heavy. Very beautiful! Although 2 months and the chain broke
4.0,Runs a little small but DO cute.
4.0,"The locket is worth it, chain is cheap"
4.0,It's nice I give it 4 stars due to the fact that I emailed the seller to correct my order the plate or charm is way to small but nice
4.0,"The colors are vibrant and pretty. This fits well, but a little on the small side, but still very cute. My daughter loved it."
4.0,"Update March2020:<br /><br />I've been meaning to come back to this after using it more. Finally time to do so. I'm upgrading this from 4 to 5 stars, because after many many uses both casually and for perfomances, it has held up well, kept its shape, and proven to be up to the task.<br /><br />Solid product.<br /><br />------original review:<br /><br />The most difficult aspect of buying any mask is not only the over all fit, but the spacing of the features. This mask is not overly tight, which means with a little pinching and pulling, I could adjust the mask to be loose in the right areas, and it lined up very nicely with my eyes (which is I think is where masks either succeed or fail). The eye holes are not too big that you see a lot of skin underneath. They are just small enough that if they aren't adjusted to be in the right place, they are a bit uncomfortable, but thats the trade off for a close fit. I was able to get it adjusted so it hung quite naturally, and my eyes fit well.  The mouth is a tiny bit lower than I would like, but not bad. Was able to drink etc, easily.  The trade off for it being just slack enough to adjust, is that it isn't /quite/ tight enough to respond to facial movements beyond opening mouth to drink, talk, stick out tounge etc. For example, if you smile, it doesn't really register- but thats probably normal for this kind of product.  Love the long neck and shoulder flap, it helps the mask blend in and fit with/under clothing, or a body suit, with no visible skin underneath.<br /><br />Only reason for 4 stars, is I've only tried it on once, and maybe I'll discover more to review. Will update if after wearing it a few times I think it deserves a better/worse rating. But as it is, I say: buy with confidence. Arrived very quickly too."
4.0,"As seller described, low quality diamonds. I did receive then slightly chipped near setting and seller offered a full refund, despite telling me he warned me that they were poor quality before he sold them to me. Seller has excellent ship time and responds swiftly to all questions. I WILL buy from him again!!"
4.0,"The pants are excellent, except for one major flaw:  The buttons rare held on by only one or two loops of fragile thread.  Every button fell off the firrst time I wore them.  Once I properly properly attached them I am happy.  I bought two other pairs in other colors, with the same result."
4.0,Bought this ring for my mom it's very dainty and cute
4.0,I liked it. Super cute. WIsh it was in different colors too.
4.0,"Was perfect for my travel to Guatemala. Easy to hold around my small wrist. Hard to see by others that I have a purse , that made me feel more comfortable walking around shopping & sight seeing."
4.0,"Its a handsome little wallet.  Its much lighter than my old bifold and bulges less in my front pocket. It can still hold a lot of cards but I feel like the point of this wallet is to minimize what you take around with you.  I'd rate it 5 stars if it was less awkward to carry cash in it. I feel like I have to be careful I don't rip the cash when pulling it out of the front and back pocket, and careful not to drop it when I take it and everything out of the middle one. overall its a great little card wallet"
4.0,"This has got to be the 3rd time I've ordered from Amazon and the fabric or quality of the item I ordered was nothing like the product, these pants looked like a nice comfy sweatpant but the material is kinda crunchy. And having one side be a zipper pocket and the other side not is a complete waste. It's uncomfortable to put your hands in the pockets because they are not the same. All in all the pants were constantly sliding down my body even after re-tieing them several times, and you are supposed to work out in these?!?!? Get ready to put on a show I guess... As for fit, they were plenty long I got a medium and I'm 5' 9"
4.0,"This dress is pretty. The material is soft and forgiving. The ruching is very flattering for a postpartum body. It also helps to define my waist. Half the rushing covers my belly while the rest of the material drapes over my lower belly instead of hugging it which I like. The dress is versatile. I believe it can be worn to a dinner date, church, work or a cocktail party. I'm 5'7"" and about 200lbs, I have on a size XL. The length comes right to my knees. The material of the dress is nice, stretchy and very comfortable. I think it can be worn in all seasons. The material is thin but not see through. I think it can be worn in the winter paired with leggings. It's a plus that it's breastfeeding friendly. If you're a nursing mom don't hesitate! The only con is that it's not the same color as it is in the advertised photo. It is much lighter. Overall, it's a beautiful and well constructed dress."
4.0,"This dress is adorable and fits pretty okay, it wasn‚Äôt really loose anywhere but the chest fit kind of weird"
4.0,"Just what I needed,all different sizes! Much better than going to the mall and buying 5 different pair."
4.0,A little small but love the shirt. I will get one size bigger next time. I am 172 and 5‚Äô8 and wear XL.
4.0,"Absolutely comfortable right out of the box. From my experience they run small, I usually wear 9.5w in most boots and a 10D in red wings. Had to make 2 exchanges to get a good fit with a 10.5D, but it's worth it. Seems to have quality construction, will see how it holds up.<br /><br />Lasted approximately 8 months of hard use before the sides and the stitching gave out."
4.0,GREAT  EARRINGS
4.0,These fit great and look cute when I first got them! I've worn them a lot since then so they are starting to get that lose feel to them but they still look great. I'm not sure if I should wash them because I'm afraid they may fall apart.
4.0,nice but order 1 size larger for a good fit
4.0,This is a gift for a huge Zelda fan. I know he'll like it.<br />It's a little bigger than I expected but it doesn't feel as cheap as it was. I'm happy with it!
4.0,Love the flow of this. Not long enough to wear without something under it! Unless you‚Äôre the model pictured. Very comfortable fabric
4.0,"I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars for the color. The silver/gray is a bit like a metallic lavender. I like everything else about the purse so I‚Äôm keeping it. The color isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs just not what I would call silver/gray, and I really wanted a true silver. Imagine rose gold, but rose silver."
4.0,"I like it a lot, was wondering if it comes in other colors(i.e. black, gold, silver)"
4.0,Feels strong with the screen to keyboard connection. Time will tell.
4.0,Reasonable price.  Sturdy.  Did not work well for fabric straps with interfacing.
4.0,I bought this for my mom to wear around St Patrick's day. She loved it but it's huge on her. She just added a couple stitch's and it fits a little better.
4.0,gave them as a gift.
4.0,"These work very well, especially the yellow night time ones. The only downside is that the clip part broke off the daytime ones within a few weeks of having them and I had to glue the clip back together. I use them on a daily basis as I drive quiet often for work so it may have broken from over use."
4.0,Lightweight glasses that are fashionable. It not super comfortable for long wear.
4.0,"I guess it depends on body size but these leggings really show the fatty rolls and camel toe, my other leggings don't show camel toe and I'm pretty fat lol. So a long t-shirt dress would go great with this so it can hide the upper part of my legs."
4.0,Pretty cute for the price but runs large.
4.0,"Very adorable color, the protective sides are really awesome honestly.<br />love it!"
4.0,Shirt isn't very soft. Washing helped a little. I'll just have to wear it out a bit ;) Other than that its great!
4.0,"Perfect for someone with small feet (size 6). They are so SOFT, plush, and COMFORTABLE. The added no-slip grips on the bottom makes it easy to go from carpet to hardwood flooring without slipping. Glad the weather is still on the cool side so these can be enjoyed a while longer."
4.0,Bought this bag as an alternative to my backpack/diaper bag. Fits lots of stuff. Does have a few small inside separation pockets that I wish were a bit bigger. Other than that I really like this bag.
4.0,"Good quality tie. Matte. Nice color and goes well with blue, grey or tan suits."
4.0,"I actually ordered these by mistake. I was considering them for my son and meant to add them to a list, but instead I---well, I got the socks. He'll love them. And they are well made. Sooooo soft. Colors are vibrant, contrast is sharp. The only thing I don't like about them is the price. $12.99 for a pair of socks with a picture on them seems high. If the price doesn't disagree with you, neither will the socks. Price is the only thing keeping them from a five-star review."
4.0,Was large and comfy. Did shed black fibres on my coat but was able to cover my face and keep me warm and that was the most important thing.
4.0,Just as described.  It is long enough to cover my arms and will be perfect for my winter wedding.  The fur is really soft and it has a great silk type lining under.  The only thing I may need is a brooch or pin of some sort to keep it closed so I don't have to fuss with it while holding my bouquet and such.
4.0,"I read a prior review stating the bee was small and expected it upon ordering. The bee is hardly noticable to anyone that is more than a foot from your face (ear, whatever), but I really purchased these more for the sweet honey comb cut out design. They're light weight which is great for larger sizes. I think the preview photo is deceptive about the quality of the wood and the detail of the bee. The flare is slightly smaller than expected, but this overall a good product. If I lost these for any reason, I'd definitely buy them again."
4.0,Very nice bra but is a bit small.
4.0,"We bought these for my 96 year old grandmother who recently had a stroke and his house bound. They're a well made product but unfortunately made my grandmother trip and almost fall because they grip so well!  I guess for someone that doesn't shuffle their feet or drag them at all it'd be a great product but before ordering these for anyone older watch how they walk as you could run into the same situation.  In the end 2 pairs of socks were our best solution, one regular and one &#34;gripper&#34; sock over it.  By using 2 they don't fall off as they were."
4.0,"Really like this dress, the color was just as pictured and fit well. The fabric is nice and kept me cool. I gave 4 stars because there were many strings hanging from seems and buttons all over the dress. It was cheap, so it didnt bother me too much to just trim them up.<br />It is not ""poofy"", which I like but if you want more volume at the bottom you will want to buy a slip that can provide this."
4.0,This shirt is gorgeous! I absolutely loved it.<br />It does run small though. I normally wear small shirts and ordered a medium and it was pretty tight. Especially around the arm holes. It was actually cutting off my circulation and my arms aren't that big.<br />I ended up having to cut a small tear in order to wear the shirt! But you can't see it unless I lift my arms.<br />It fits really nicely every where else though.<br />Just be careful if you decide to order it!
4.0,"It was a little large, but I was able to shrink in the wash."
4.0,"I am 5'5"" and 120lbs. I ordered the size small. It fits but I would like it to be just a little bigger since I feel like the arms and legs should be a little but longer."
4.0,The earrings are very pretty  Will recommend to others will up date later after I wear them and they are very light.
4.0,"Bought these for my nieces and they loved them. The only small issue we had was putting enough pressure to get the eyes to pop up. Once they had the exact spot figured out they were able to &#34;stomp&#34; around a little better, but they didn't seem to pop as much as they do in the commercials. Cute characters, though."
4.0,Need a strapless bra but cute. I will be using a waist trainer cause fits tight
4.0,"Fits well , didn‚Äôt really like the material.  My daughter wears it a lot."
4.0,I only wish it was long sleeved. Mine had a small hole in the seam but I stitched it up quick.
4.0,"The diamonds look really grey compared to my center studs. I kept them, though."
4.0,was going to use this to wear to a fall wedding with boots but ended up being too short for the look i was going for so i had to add some leggings
4.0,"the lenses are really nice y love it , the only thing is one of them have like a line , not a scratch but a darker line across de lense"
4.0,Good value...a little difficult to  get the clasp to work but take your time and you can figure it out. Some instructions would help.
4.0,"My second set of replacement lenses.<br />The original lenses got scratched up and were completely unusable after a couple of years.<br />My first set of replacements worked great for a while but got damaged by some lens cleaner chemicals (!)<br /><br />These are clear and vivid, fit the glasses well and hold up ok to salt water and general use.<br />I use these on my motorcycle and they're fine outside in the wind, rain, and bugs.<br /><br />Took off a star because the lens cleaner wipes destroyed them.<br />Now I just use dish soap and water - that seems to work fine."
4.0,Didnt like it fits kinda snug
4.0,Fits nice but sleeves are very big. I added elastic to sleeve bottoms and that did the trick. Delivery is long waiting
4.0,It‚Äôs a great sports bra but a little bit tight it does make some of my skin spill over but it‚Äôll be good for jogging and active stuff. It‚Äôs a great dupe for lulu. I teach yoga full time and this sports bra will work for my heated and more active classes. I‚Äôm roughly a 36 C-D. About a 35 inch under bust and a 39-40 bust.
4.0,Good statement piece
4.0,"I wear a size 14-16 woman's, at the moment, and these are a little tight for me, and they sit kind of low on my hips so when I bend down they slid down a bit. I would not recommend these for anyone bigger, just smaller! The only other issues I have is, I stand at a height of 5'7' tall, and the pants come down, about an 2 inches above my ankle, so they aren't capris, but they aren't long pants either. So, if you are taller then me, or the same height, please keep that in mind as well! Also, they are skin tight. They can be a little hard to get on, especially if you are like me and have many curves. These WILL show off EVERYTHING!<br />  Now for the good stuff. I wear them around my house. They are the most comfortable pair of pants I have ever had. They are soft. They are warm, but not too warm. They do allow air in so you will not get hot while wearing them. You can move around with no issues at all. I love the fell on the inside, as well as the outside of the pants. You can walk, run, play, clean, etc. and have no issues at all.<br />  When I first received them, I did a very thorough check of the pants, and seems. No snags, no holes, no missed seems.  The pants are in perfect condition, and ready for you to wear them.<br />  Now, with all that being said, I will repeat some of it. I wear a 14-16 woman's pants. I am 5'7&#34; tall. These are skin tight, show off all the curves. The pants do slid down my tuchus when I bend over. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND these for someone of my size. I would however recommend these to someone wearing a size smaller then mine! They are nice pants and extremely comfortable.<br />  I do have to say that I did receive these pants at a discount in exchange for my OPEN, HONEST AND UNBIASED opinion. With that being said. go for it. They are awesome, and are beautiful!"
4.0,"I will start by saying that this cardigan came with a very, very strong chemical smell. However, the fit was really cute and color with floral pattern was exactly as pictured, so I decided to keep it. Gave it a co!d water washing and it smelled better, even though so smell was still there. I ordered my usual size and was pleased with the fit"
4.0,"I love this dress. Easy to wear and doesn't wrinkle. Packed it for our vacation to the beach, pulled it out and it looks great. So happy it has pockets but the armholes are a bit big. I typically wear a 12 and ordered a large. Medium would've fit better but not worth exchanging. I'll wear the L."
4.0,Some of the bandanaz don't seem to have the same &#34;beads&#34; in and/or don't seem to expand like the others.  The majority work just fine.
4.0,A little bit big on the sides but still fits really good. Super cute though !
4.0,"The shirt is nice,  however it runs big"
4.0,Nice but fit to small and did not like the way it flowed.
4.0,"It's a little long, I am 5'6&#34; and it goes to my upper calf. I need to get it shortened, but all in all, it looks great and fits great!"
4.0,"I love the feel of these on my feet--great material and almost feels soothing to put on.  Great everyday no-show sock that truly doesn't show, which can be surprisingly hard to find for men, I find.  I'm a 9.5/10, and while they do fit, they are snug, and if your feet are much larger you may have difficulty fitting into these."
4.0,I love them. I just wish there was a long option when I purchased them because regular stops at my ankles. If I see a long option I‚Äôll buy those too.
4.0,The quality of the clothes is good but It is little bit bigger for me.
4.0,"The dress is what you'd expect in a Boho---I really like it.  I'm 5'6"" 180 lbs. so I ordered a XLG and the dress fits.  I thought it was going to be too tight in the chest area in that I measured my chest size at 44 inches.  Actually, a large might even work better.  I probably will order a large and see which one looks the best and send back the other."
4.0,"Super cool style and comfortable. Carries what I need it to, but doesn't have a lot of room inside. The pouches look like they would carry more. The cell phone pouch is not big enough for today's cell phones. Don't expect to use it for your cell unless you have maybe an old Razor or Nokia. My only real complaint is the strap. The padded part really isn't long enough once you have it on, looks kind of strange."
4.0,These are very small! But light and cute. Wish they were a bit bigger...
4.0,"The red, white 7 blue  pattern is a little bright for my taste but the blue design  one is perfect."
4.0,A little snug but very durable. Even though they are tight and I've worn them a million times they are in excellent condition still!
4.0,"I like how it looks and that it stays latched. Although one week after I took it to get it sized, the pin that connected the latch came out and the watch fell off, so I had to pay $7 to get a new pin put in and $7 to have it sized the week before, so the cost went up $14. I am praying it stays together now."
4.0,Very cute! the only down side is that the paint has started chipping after a couple of wears.
4.0,"it did not fit as I wanted but a few alterations to my under garments and it  fit fine.  love the length, but off the shoulder had to go to make it fit right I still is one of my fav outfits"
4.0,It's good watch very precise on timing . Excpet for strap
4.0,Love It very nice!
4.0,"Ordered a 6x which is 2 sizes larger than I normally would order as I wanted this to fit loose and flowing.  Glad I did otherwise it would be straight hanging, tight, and binding.  I'm 6' and the 6x ends just above my ankles.  Also, very thick and heavy with fabric finish so I immediately put into a cold water wash and was relieved to find the dryer did not shrink it.  Love the full-length zipper!!  I'd order again."
4.0,"Adorable dress. Luv the flow and style of these skater dresses, they are on the smaller true to size end, so of you want additional months of wear out of this, size up. Looking forward to ordering more"
4.0,Very cute pattern! The fabric is nice and flowy. This is a wrap style but it has no danger of opening up or showing too much even in a gust of wind. A little longer than I expected from the pictures but it works. The fabric is see-through though so a slip is necessary.
4.0,"This shirt is nice and comfortable. It's thick enough that it's not see through, but thin enough to still wear during the warmer seasons. The length is great. It goes perfect with some leggings."
4.0,"They came exactly as pictured but the nose rest part was bent on one side slightly which might be due to packing. I like them and will probably keep them, I personally think they look a little off on my face type so I might give them to my sister to wear! They actually came with a little handwritten thank you card! So cute!"
4.0,So I‚Äôm a 1x and ordered and xl‚Ä¶.fits well short is very stretchy but to all<br />The no bootie chicks the pants won‚Äôt fit well ü§£ü§£ü§£
4.0,"Color was accurate, it looks beautiful on, loved it."
4.0,Great price and fun strap
4.0,"The coat itself is very cute and decently warm, although the buttons are very cheap looking and not well attached. Can fix by sewing your own buttons on but wish I didn‚Äôt have to do so."
4.0,Very nice sterling silver choker.
4.0,Cute but runs extremely small!
4.0,It‚Äôs great but the color definitely doesn‚Äôt match the picture
4.0,I like how shiny it has stayed.  I have worn it everyday since receiving it.
4.0,"I use this for work to carry all my daily items, lots of room and material is thick/ higher quality than most. I am unable to adjust the strap to fit my waist, that would of been 5 stars."
4.0,The keychain is really nice and the metal feels very solid but it did not fit my key. My Acura key fob has a notch on the corner and this was very straight and would not fit. Make sure you have the key pictured.
4.0,For us taller girls it kind of rides up...... I even got a size bigger. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 size 12/13 and I ordered the xl. But it‚Äôs super cute!
4.0,My daughter loves her panda pjs!
4.0,Not fancy but functional! Durable for frequent washing and comfortable! Cotton cooler in the hot summer weather. Good buy!
4.0,My husband loves the hat!
4.0,"Very vibrant colors and makes the phone feel great in my hand! I subtracted a star because I'm not 100% confidant it will be protective to the phone, but we shall see!!"
4.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful but I am 5'10 and it hit lower mid calf and was a bit awkward looking with the heels I own. It would be great for someone a couple inches shorter.
4.0,You need to get a 4X in your sizes.
4.0,I‚Äôm very happy with this bag as I only paid 10 for it. It has enough room and many pockets to include everything.<br />It does not seem to be durable but for me it does the job.
4.0,"The only thing I don't like about these, is the rainbow sheen on them goes away once it gets wet, ie: once it's in your mouth. They just look clear against your tongue. The only reason I bought these was for their irradescent color. I'm a little disappointed. Otherwise, size and length are fine."
4.0,Perfect length but very fine and loose material.  More like gauze.
4.0,Liitle tight but great color pairing with parrot green sweater
4.0,"Very pretty earrings.  They have an oblong shape to them, but not enough to keep me from wearing them with my round, pearl necklace.  I was impressed with the beautiful gift box and jewelry box they came in.  They would make a wonderful gift for any woman with pierced ears."
4.0,Nice hat! Runs a little small. Bought for teenager.
4.0,"I called these &#34;the Charlie Brown shoes&#34;. They were so cute on mu daughter but in the brown color I think they would look nice on a little boy as well. My daughter was a really early walker and probably needed something with a hard sole. As it is, these wore out pretty quickly. I would recommend these for a crawler or as a dress up shoe."
4.0,nice nightgown for the price. Probably best to order a size up to have extra room.
4.0,"Giving it a 4 due to the straps rubbing a blusher into the top of my foot. Also, when I opened them there was a jewel missing already"
4.0,"I went with a large even though I wear a size small / size 4 panty... the leg holes are rather large but the band on top of the panty was excruciating Lee tight. I wore them at home for a couple of months before wearing them under clothes and they finally loosened up around the band. Also the band is extremely low-cut so keep that in mind. Now they work out pretty good and I love them but it took a long time to stretch that band out, that said that I didn't have muffin tops lol"
4.0,"Pros:<br />Minimalist<br />Modern/Rustic design<br />Great craftsmanship<br />Feels like it was built for me personally<br />Not bulky<br />Lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br />The cut ends of the leather could be a bit more refined, small particles from the ends keep rubbing off on my clothes. If the clothes is dark it's not a big deal, but light clothes it shows alot. It messed up a white shirt once, I'll just have to avoid wearing it with whites or carry it via the hand strap.<br /><br />Apart from that I very satisfied, I've gotten many compliments from friends and family about the bad."
4.0,"This isnt a shoe like the questions asked, but the product was good. was a small gift for someone."
4.0,I like the bag it comes in handy for all my medical work supplies
4.0,BUT TOO BIG ON MY FACE AM SO SAD... I HAD TO GIVE IT TO THE FAT GUY.... EVEN THOUGHT I LOVED THE QUALITY ITS AMAZING
4.0,I do really like this product I got a little more then the amount I asked for which was cool. I wish there was a little more variety. But overall Im happy I bought this
4.0,Very nice ~ my sister like it a lot!
4.0,Fit is a little small but not uncomfortable I use it for early morning Golf and it works great not to heavy not to lite it serves the purpose just fine zipper is on left side.
4.0,Nice runs small
4.0,Came in a timely manner an fits nicely. The colors are spot on. Sharp looking shorts!
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and weigh 250lbs. I ordered the 2x and it fits snug. It‚Äôs not loose or flowy BUT it‚Äôs very cute and great material. I love it.
4.0,These are a little more Black than Green.  For the price it was worth it.  I would buy them again.
4.0,It serves the purpose.  Bought it for our beach condo. Good quality but the beige/brown tones were more predominate than I wanted or thought they would be. I did keep it tho.
4.0,"Product arrived in good timing. The material is what you expect for a Halloween costume. It‚Äôs not a one piece at all , its two pieces and a hat. The print is well done just the number feels like a sticker stuck on . For the price is good . Easy simple and affordable"
4.0,"Very pretty top.  I bought it for a trip to Hawaii and it will work perfect.  It's a little short for my taste as a dress, so I paired it with navy leggings and it looks great."
4.0,My fianc√© like the ring very much
4.0,"This was a gift to my husband for our first anniversary. I liked the font options for the price point. I took the extra keyring out because it made the whole thing stiff, but that's a preference and an easy fix. Took off a star, because it came noticeably scratched up on the back."
4.0,Hope he likes it.
4.0,"Fits fine but just a little boxy for my taste, very plain and good for a professional work place."
4.0,"These are really beautiful prints. Have a nice stretch and look great. They are thick‚Ä¶and for some will be hot. These are double so can do different styles. The only down side to these is that they are thicker than my other ones. I‚Äôm sure in winter, I‚Äôll really appreciate them!"
4.0,"It took a while to arrive and I never heard any feedback from the seller which was frustrating, but it showed up today and the mask is very pretty and good quality.  I‚Äôm happy to have it now."
4.0,"I do, from time to time, have a need to cover my throat where my permanent tracheotomy is, so I'm always on the lookout for something light and breathable that doesn't make me look like a bandito from some 70s western movie as regular bandannas do. The color is great, it's light, it allows air through without it feeling drafty, and since it's a loop, there is no worry about loose ends hanging around."
4.0,I love the sleek design and the multiple slots for all my cards. Now I can keep everything in one place w/o taking up a lot of room and being bulky. Very nice product.
4.0,I really like this hooded cardigan which is more like a sweater. It's wool so I tend to get hot easily. It's perfect for a cool day and I love the length. I kinda still smells like the packaging after a couple washes but I'm sure that will go away eventually.
4.0,"I started getting in to ‚Äúinexpensive‚Äù watches a few years ago (ie replace every year or so) and this was my latest. Looks great, seems to take time perfectly. Unsure what more I would want."
4.0,I am satisfied. It serves its purpose n adds a bit of zest.
4.0,I love them other then the bows fell off right away but they are comfortable and very nice
4.0,"I got a large size because I'm tall and busty although narrow in the hips. It fits quite comfortably except it is a bit short, both bottoms and sleeves  (I'm 5.8') Very soft and feels cool."
4.0,I like the glasses but prefer a smaller frame.
4.0,"**EDIT**<br />Wore this on a short domestic trip. First, the pad pocket is just SLIGHTLY too small for my galaxy tablet when in its case with the built-in bluetooth keyboard. Second, the pockets DO end up looking lumpy and ridiculous. BUT, i was plenty warm in it and the wire control worked well for my headphones.<br />******<br />I had been eyeing this for an upcoming Europe trip when I received it for my birthday. I had selected large even though, according to the size chart, I should fit a medium largely due to reviews which said it ran small and the fact that I will be wanting to stuff it full of stuff and not look completely ridiculous.<br />First of all, I can say that it fits mostly as expected. The shoulders are a bit big and stick out even more thanks to the removable sleeve feature and it's loose through the torso. I assume a medium would have been a more fitted look. However, the sleeves are just BARELY long enough. I don't generally have a problem with sleeve length so that was a surprise and I wonder if I would have found the medium sleeves ridiculously short.<br />Second, it arrived quite wrinkled and while it's machine washable (a must for travel), it can only be cool ironed, which basically does diddly squat. This is generally a bad feature for any travel clothing because you'll end up walking off the plane looking like a rumpled mess.<br />I will also say that while the larger size does seem to disguise some full pockets, others clearly end up showing lumps no matter what. I love the cell phone pocket for ease of access (unless you zip up the collar all the way it's very easy to reach inside and grab it from its little half zip pocket), but if I zip the jacket at all, it becomes immediately clear there's a big square ""brick"" right above my chest.<br />I agree with previous reviews that, for the money, you would have thought the look would be a bit sleeker, but I do think it will help me keep my personal item to a small purse instead of a giant tote without looking like I'm going on safari which was the goal."
4.0,"It is cute and just as pictured, but runs really small. I went up 1 size and it is skin tight. It works for my purposes, but would suggest going up 2-3 sizes for comfort."
4.0,This skirt is so cute! The band is a little tight but it‚Äôs very flattering.
4.0,Did what I wanted. Good value
4.0,"I got these gloves for my Latula cosplay and they arrived rather quickly! These gloves are a wonderful color, good quality and are  true to the picture. The price is great and the gloves look nicer than something from a party shop for the same price.  They might be tight for longer or thicker fingered hands but they fit my hands and wrists nicely. (i am a small in glove size) I do suggest trimming the excess fabric on the inside of the gloves around the pointer, thumb, and pinkie fingers for a better fit and look, but all in all its a good buy."
4.0,"This is a well made sweater. Nicely sewn and looks expensive. Great attention to detail. On me, however, it looked matronly rather than flattering. That square neckline is not for everyone.  I still reccomend you give it a try and see. On the right person it will look very elegant."
4.0,The shirt is super great! Im a huge 80s fanatic when it comes to music n movies. Karate kid is def a classic. I love the vintage look of the shirt..its recognizable from miles away. Only reason why i knocked down one star..it is so small. Its more of a xtra small than just a small. Im a little nervous when I have to wash it. But other than that...its a kick ass shirt!
4.0,Looked nice just runs small
4.0,Only comes in one size
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 160 lbs and the large was very long (hit at mid-calf), and very baggy. I will probably reorder a size down because the print is darling and material is lightweight. Great for a guest at an outdoor wedding!"
4.0,"I wear these flip flops all year, every year, for the past 2 and a half years.<br />I've worn them in the cold winters of Boston, and the hot summers of California.<br />If you wear them as extensively as I do, they last exactly 8 months, but for those 8 months they're great."
4.0,"I like it.But,Creased front."
4.0,Bought as a gift for my wife. She likes the quality and fit of this robe but has said that the tie is very high on the robe. 4 out of 5 stars.
4.0,Exercise but also shapewear.  It fits true to size.
4.0,These sunglasses make it easier for me to get outdoors again. The sun here is bright and I need to control the glare.
4.0,Its a nice product. Seems well made and my girlfriend loves it
4.0,Wore this for my niece's wedding (guest) and it was very cute. A little tight in the chest; I'm a D cup.
4.0,They are very cute but if you put them on  for like 2 weeks they start to stretch out
4.0,Pretty color.  Lightweight.
4.0,band looks cheap if you focus on it.
4.0,"Color Looks exactly like the same. Came on time, but material looks cheap..."
4.0,"These are probably the lightest pair of sunglasses that I have.<br />It doesn't feel flimsy, and seems to be somewhat flexy.<br />They do claim to have a lifetime warranty on the frame.<br /><br />The lenses are on the larger side, which I like, but given that there is no separate nose bridge and the shape of my face, the bottom of the lens nearly touches my face. I'll probably have attach something to get me a bit more spacing. This cost it a star.<br /><br />The lenses are adequate for outdoor quality. There is no distortion, and have a good amount of sun blockage. I do have a pair that does seem to enhance the vision, but the price point is much higher than these. For the price and being so lightweight - these are pretty decent glasses."
4.0,This is a very comfortable shirt.  I typically purchase X-Large but decided to size down after reading reviews.  Glad I did as the large is still very roomy.  The top hides mid-section issues beautifully.  Would have rated it 5 stars except one of the removable pearl buttons was missing. The buttons are what gives this top some class.  I happened to purchase this same top in black. It arrived with both buttons.  I'm able to use the buttons from the black top.  Easier to &#34;interchange&#34; the buttons than to EXCHANGE the top.
4.0,My son loves these shoes. My only complaint is that the tab at the end of the bungees came undone on day 1.
4.0,I absolutely love this top. For the most part.<br />It‚Äôs fits so nice and it looks so cute. The buttons are amazing because they‚Äôre real so they work with nursing. However that‚Äôs also where I have and issue. The button holes are almost to big for the buttons. The buttons don‚Äôt stay shut
4.0,"Pretty color but huge.  The shirt was several inches too wide and the sleeves were several inches too long.  I usually wear a medium but ordered large because most tops made in China run small.  The shirt I received is marked 'large' but is probably equivalent to XXL or even XXXL.  The seller contacted me to offer several options to resolve the issue,  Their customer service reflects their commitment to customer satisfaction.  I hope to purchase from them again."
4.0,Nice sunglasses. Tint a little darker than I expected Lightly tinted is misleading.
4.0,I didn‚Äôt get the distressed jeans. They‚Äôre regular ones. I like them so I‚Äôll keep them.
4.0,"i bought it for a halloween costume. but it actually seems pretty well made, it‚Äôs not lightweight and doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúcheap‚Äù"
4.0,But really good quality.
4.0,The outfit itself was awesome fit perfect. The wrap that goes around the waist was wayyy too small. I wear a 5/6 and a small did not fit me.
4.0,"Its a cute ring.  It looks a little bit cheap, but I am happy with it for what it is."
4.0,I have ordered several pairs of PajamaJeans and they all have a slightly different fit.  These were too small for me.
4.0,"Just don‚Äôt ever drop it or drag it across anything because the scratches come easily and will never go away, after a week it looked pretty used but still nice even though no one still respects my pronouns."
4.0,"Delivery was on time and product was as expected. Too soon now to say how it will hold up to laundry and wear, but seems to be a good product."
4.0,Used for dh mtb really comfortable
4.0,The earrings arrived early.  The o-rings are somewhat fragile but the earrings look great in!
4.0,It is what it is. It's‚Äã a nike shoe
4.0,Ordered this bag for a specific event.  Bigger than I thought but that wasn‚Äôt an issue.  Very stiff and makes funny squeaks when you move it.  Overall good bag for the money.  Looks more expensive than it is.
4.0,"Mask is great for cosplay. Well made and sturdy. I‚Äôm using mine to do Carnage, so just using the venom base and repainting. You may want to poke breathing holes for your mouth though because there aren‚Äôt any. Also it gets very hot inside so just make sure you are in a cool place when wearing."
4.0,Definitely runs small.  Gave it to a friend. She loves it.
4.0,"I was a little confused on how to wear this when i got it. But its pretty neat. There are several ways you could wear it and you could add those larger pendants to this and it would look amazing. With just itself, it can be worn wrapped a few times or in a bow or just hanging. Its very toughly made. Its not real suede but it is very close look to it. You could wear this as a bracelet or a anklet, so many ideas. Did come in a little box so great gift for someone who you aren't sure what they wear and since its not metal, less likely for allergies.<br /><br />i received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,Just received. Will be Christmas gift. I don‚Äôt know anythmg about at this time.
4.0,"I liked the stretch, very stretchy. It is just a tad too big though so I can only wear longer work shirts. But I got a good deal for this so I‚Äôm happy"
4.0,"Definitely synthetic, as advertised!  Good tool."
4.0,"Cute, but sleeves are an awkward length. Too long to be three quarters but not long enough for full length."
4.0,Fits as expected and Mom likes it but the lace is scratchy
4.0,"The skirt is beautiful. I normally wear 2x for bottoms, i ordered a 3x in this skirt because i was afraid of it being small like previous things ive bought off of amazon. It is still a bit snug, certainly not a 3x. I still love it and still plan on wearing it. Its beautiful and very well made. Packaging was nice and it took the usual 2 weeks to get here. Overall.. Happy. But beware of the sizing."
4.0,"This this the second bracelet I've bought from this vendor. The other was black tourmaline. This one pretty much looks like the picture, but the beads generally are more gray than online. There is a range in colors, primarily milky to dark gray, blue black, and shades of tan and brown. There is a bit of depth to them, but mostly opaque. Not an expert, but I can see they are obviously real stones. Can't speak to the properties they are supposed to have, since I just put it on for the first time yesterday, but I guess I'll find out. Elastic cord seems pretty secure. Came with a selenite stone for charging."
4.0,Great for shower and steam room at health club or hotel.  Light weight and easy to transport.
4.0,very pretty for the money you could wear this to a very nice place doesn't look cheap sparkles so pretty.üòç
4.0,Really cute dress and my daughter loves it. I should‚Äôve sized down though. My daughter wears 4T/5T so that‚Äôs what I ordered. It‚Äôs very very long. It‚Äôs more like a 6/7. I‚Äôm going to have to hem it up about 3 inches so she won‚Äôt trip and step on the material.
4.0,"Got these for post c-section hospital stay.  They fit as expected and are high waisted as advertised.  A bit more sheer than i would like - can see underwear through - even solid colors - which is reason i took away 1 star.  I probably wouldn't wear them to the gym,  but great for around the house or yard projects - with a long shirt to cover your butt.  Quality in line with cost though."
4.0,"The clasps are a little stiff and some don't work at all, but for this price WOW!"

4.0,"(SCROLL DOWN FOR PROS AND CONS LIST. First paragraphs are my impression and description.)<br /><br />I really love this set of nose rings. I usually wear stud style nose rings but every now and then i like to change it up. Hoop nose rings, in my opinion, can really change up your look and style and can noticeably add to an outfit. They are a more noticeable, eye catching style, which will be noticed easier than small studs that tend to be more subtle. The open hoop style is one I prefer and I find them easier to wear. It leaves some open space in your nostril that I find far more comfortable for day to day wear. (TMI warning! LoL ‚Äì They are WAY easier to deal with when you need to blow your nose! When I have a full hoop in my nose it can really hurt trying to blow my nose and having to maneuver it.)<br /><br />This set of nose rings came in a handy little plastic box that can hold them safely for travel or storage. They were each individually wrapped in plastic sleeves before I opened them. There are five colors provided: silver, yellow/gold, black, a blue chrome finish, and a multi-colored chrome finish that reflects different colors in different light (it leans predominantly more green/yellow and resembles an ‚Äòoil slick‚Äô appearance). The color selection includes all the ‚Äòbasic‚Äô colors for a wardrobe I could want. They are core colors that will match most of my jewelry and other accessories that I would add to a look. On top of having the go to colors of black, silver, and gold ‚Äì they also include two REALLY fun ones for more funky moods and I LOVE the chrome finish on the blue nose ring as well as the REALLY COOL effect the ‚Äòoil-slick‚Äô one has.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Great price for a set of 5 nose rings. (~$2 for a nose ring is a great deal - Especially for a hoop in my buying experience!)<br />-Comes with a durable handy plastic case for storage.<br />-GREAT QUALITY for the PRICE! (I have worn the silver one for most of the month I have had these and it is still in GREAT condition.)<br />-Sellers pictures accurately show how the rings will look.<br />-SHINY clean finishes that have not dulled or discolored with time. (I have had these about a month and they still look new and as they were when I got them.)<br />-GREAT VERSATILE color selection! (Includes all basic colors for most wardrobes/matching accessories.)<br />-UNIQUE , VERY COOL, multi-chrome finish on one! (It really looks like an ‚Äòoil slick‚Äô and I love the effect. It reflects different colors when caught in different light!)<br />-Popular 20 gauge size that will fit most nose piercings. (My nose was irritated when I first got it in, but I adjusted and they were very comfortable to wear and fit well.)<br />-Stainless Steel made and does not irritate my skin! (It was only irritated when I first put it in because I had tons of trouble getting it in there!)<br />-It does not fall out or shift much. It stays put once it is in.<br />-OPEN HOOP style that allows space inside the nostril and is more comfortable to wear than closed hoops that must be clicked shut. (Blowing your nose is so much easier with this style rather than closed hoops!)<br />-When put in the nose the right way for the odd design of the hoop, the gap DOES NOT show and it looks like a closed hoop in the nose.<br />-Appropriate size hoop that sits well in my nostril. (It doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äòtoo big‚Äô or ‚Äòtoo small‚Äô for my nose and it fits well. I provided a picture showing it in for an idea on the size.)<br /><br />CONS<br />- POOR DESIGN. They have to be put it from the INSIDE of the nostril going OUT! They are NOT EASY to get in! (I have never had to put a nose ring in from the INSIDE of the nostril going OUT so it was quite the ordeal getting the hoop in at first. I could NOT find the piercing on the inside of my nostril and irritated my piercing trying to get it in and there was some slight swelling afterwards. I can‚Äôt complain for $2 a ring though and am still happy with this purchase ‚Äì it is a CHALLENGE to get these in though so fair warning!!!)<br /><br />Overall, I am REALLY happy with this purchase. You really can‚Äôt beat the price for what you get. The rings look to be high quality as well as feeling durable and sturdy. I have had these about a month and they still look brand new and have worn VERY WELL. The size of the hoop fits my face and is a good size. The set includes all the ‚Äòbasic‚Äô colors you could want and I LOVE that black is included! It is great having gold and silver for when you want to wear different jewelry but the black is my favorite because I have A LOT of black in my wardrobe and it goes with EVERYTHING! The blue and multi-chrome ones were just added bonuses for me and really great colors. I have blue eyes so I love that blue was part of the set. (Blue is a REALLY popular color anyway it seems, so I think it was a great choice.) They feel comfortable in and I don‚Äôt even feel it there that I forget I have a hoop in sometimes. The gap can‚Äôt be seen when it is put in but it allows more space in the nostril. The only complaint is the odd design. I didn‚Äôt know there were nose rings that had to be put in from the INSIDE OF THE NOSE! LoL In order for the gap to be hidden in the nose and for the ‚Äòstopper‚Äô or circle on the end of the hoop to be hidden, it has to be inside the nose. I just think it is so backwards. It was CRAZY HARD to get these suckers in at first and there were SEVERAL ATTEMPTS before I got them in. If you are up for the challenge and want to save money then they are WORTH it. If you don‚Äôt want to deal with getting them in and performing what seems like some pseudo-surgery looking in a mirror up your nose feeling around like you‚Äôre blind dodging nose hair, then DON‚ÄôT GET THESE! If you are one to change your nose rings A LOT, and want these hoops to specifically wear for SHORT TERM periods, I would say the hassle of getting them in IS NOT WORTH IT. Once I finally got mine in, my piercing was slightly swollen, and to go through all that just to try and put a different color hoop in the next day, it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it to me. IF I was just putting the hoop in for a day and then switching to a stud I would be fine with it though! I received these at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. These opinions are my own and I was not swayed in any way. If you have any questions let me know and I will do my best to help!"
4.0,"Fits well, I ordered a size up. Shoulders are narrow. Washes well."
4.0,"I really like the detail on this sweater. It is a medium thickness, not thin and not thick. The color is true to the picture, it is a cream color. This is something I can easily wear to work with some nice slacks or a skirt. I could also wear it more casual with a pair of leggings or jeans. It does run large. I ordered a size small and it is very baggy on me. I can tuck it in the front to give it some shape but if I wear it just the way it is, it is very boxy."
4.0,"This coat was very warm and stylish on me! Its great for those chilly, brisk days."
4.0,"I order one three size larger than I usually. It fit me perfectly. I like the style,it's cool."
4.0,"I really like these tanks. The material is perfect for everything in Texas weather. I wish there was a little more &#34;compression&#34; in them, but that's not at all a deal breaker. I will be buying more very soon!"
4.0,Absolutely love this on my phone three-year-old granddaughter the only thing is that the straps had to be tied in the back because it hung too low
4.0,"I received this suit last week and tried it on the day I got it. I am actually pretty impressed with how well it fit. The only complaints I have, are that it isn't as high waisted as what I was hoping. It hits about a finger width below the belly button. (Normal rise jeans) and the top tends to show a lot of the liner in the cleavage part. I will still wear it and feel comfortable, I was just expecting something a little different when I placed the order."
4.0,Product is nice but not made for busy women.  The top part of the robe is small and pops open.
4.0,"Honestly, I love this wallet. Tons of room, holds all I need it to & more. However, the only downfall I found that would make me look elsewhere before buying another, is the strap. It literally fell apart after about 2 weeks of regular use. Thankfully I don't really need the strap."
4.0,"Quality is very nice, much nicer than I anticipated to be quite honest. However, I think I ordered a size too big for me."
4.0,"Seem ok so far,lets see how they hold up"
4.0,Great for kids. Must say the eye shield piece is poor quality as it‚Äôs very blurry and the filters are for adult size mask so you must cut it . Other than that it‚Äôs great
4.0,Fits perfect looks grate<br />Downside-back has 4 hooks difficult to zip unless it‚Äôs done first on the front
4.0,Perfect for wedding!. Love it!
4.0,Very good quality and it shipped fast as well
4.0,Nice shirt and great service but the collar is mot proportional to shirt
4.0,"I like that you can see through it. However, if it were raining really hard, that might not work so well.  It is shaped in such a way that it is not likely to flip on you in the wind. The plastic itself seems pretty thin; I'll use it for a while and come back for an update.  It is lightweight, which is good if you're walking a long way.  I got it at a discount for the purposes of reviewing it."
4.0,The quality of the fiber and the stitching is really fantastic. They might run a little big.
4.0,Company does well with our questions and gloves working well
4.0,"I do love the clutch, but the strap on it is awful.  The first time I used it, it caught on my nice lace dress and ruined the shoulder of it.  I had to go get it fixed.  So, I took the strap off and have not used it since.  Even without the strap, it's still cute."
4.0,"This is a great bohemian style necklace.  I wish it went further around the neck, but it is a fun piece.  I like the silvered element and the shape of the necklace as it is almost a choker length necklace.  It really make any simple element funky and trendy.  Great finishing touch! A really easy way to make a statement."
4.0,Went with the size guide and didnt fugure to size down but i would recommend sizing down if you truely want a compression tank top
4.0,"I am 5'3"", 130#'s and B to C cup size. I am returning this set only because I am too short in the torso and it doesn't fit me correctly. I would otherwise keep it, it's soft and very pretty."
4.0,Nice material  and sized just right
4.0,It‚Äôs a bit small. I‚Äôm a thick girl so it JUST made it around my waist. But it served its purpose so not bad overall. Just wish it was bigger so larger people have a chance to adjust it to their fitting.
4.0,"It looks like the picture, maybe even a little more vibrant, more turquoise actually. The only thing I didn't love about this is the &#34;square&#34; shoulder shape, not a fan coming from someone who doesn't have &#34;delicate&#34; shoulders to begin with."
4.0,Great quality for the price. Runs a little large.
4.0,These are so comfy! I'm 5'3 so they are a little longer than a normal Capri length but other than that I love them!
4.0,"This is adorable!! I am obsessed with this song and obsessed with Hocus Pocus so this was the perfect purchase for Halloween. I ordered an XL, which is my normal size, and it ran a little small. Got so many compliments.  Even if I never wear it again, I will forever keep this."
4.0,"I like the shirt. Its soft and comfortable,  however, I'm not sure how long it'll last. It seems to be fading a little already after just 2 washes"
4.0,I've used them once for my kickboxing class so far. The gym does not let you wear shoes. I like them! Enough grip that my feet don't slip when doing push-ups or mountain climbers. I have issues with my Achilles but do not feel supported my these. I have size 9 women's feet and the socks almost feel too short but plenty of room width wise. So figure a men's size 8. I ordered a medium if that helps you determine your size. **Update. The socks have stretched enough that I don't feel my toe pushing at the edge. I have about 6+ classes with  them. Still them
4.0,My husband likes the leather look bags instead of the canvas ones.  He purchased two other bags of this type for travel but he wanted a smaller bag for the gym.  He's very satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,"Definitely runs small. Order one or two sizes up. I bought a different model North Face snow boots last year for my daughter, but because it is the same brand, the size chart reference should be the same. I ordered 1 size bigger after reading the reviews, but the pair was practically the same size as the ones from last year, which are 2 sizes smaller.  This pair was a bit heavy for my daughter, too, so instead of getting a bigger size, we went for another model."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, little smaller than expected"
4.0,Love this dress. I used to go to the pool or beaches
4.0,El detalle m√°s bello de la blusa vino da√±ado o roto por esa raz√≥n le pido se me envi√© uno que sirva o devuelvo la blusa y me env√≠a una que no est√© da√±ada
4.0,The ties are great quality and beautiful. Worth the money.
4.0,There was a small crack in the lenses.
4.0,"Love these earring and get tons of compliments on them. However, one earring has the words printed backwards as pictured. Not sure why...maybe that's for selfies! lol. I solved that problem by ordering a second pair so that I had one complete, non backwards pair. You still can't beat the price, even when ordering two sets."
4.0,"Comfortable, light weight, reasonably priced. I bought a size larger as I don't like fleece to be tight. I haven't worn it enough to comment on durability, but I hope that this product is just like the Russell fleece zips I have bought in the past (they wash well and last)."
4.0,Loveeeee it but I got beat head phones for Christmas and they will not fit in there :(
4.0,One of the seams is coming out inside of it after a few weeks but otherwise its cute!
4.0,"There were no heat packs in my package, but the mittens kept my hands nice and warm while snowboarding. It was only 4 degrees outside, so they did the job."
4.0,Love it it look like  high price and classic
4.0,"This was a great value for the amount of jewelry included. I wish the little ball at the end of the studs was a tad larger as sometimes these lift out of my nose and I have lost a couple of them. Aside from that because of the value and overall I've had these for years now, I'm pretty happy with this purchase and would get them again."
4.0,"I was very disappointed in the print quality of the butterfly's on this top. The online images look crisp and clear, but in person the butterflies are blurry. I wore this on a trip during a heat spell and that was a mistake as this top was just about as hot and miserable to wear in the heat and humidity as it could be.<br /><br />But I only took 1 star off for those items because the top is really well made, the fabric very soft and this should be comfortable in more mild conditions. The fabric is very heavy for the type and style of the top. I am going to wait for cooler weather to wear this.<br /><br />When I first put this on I wasn't to thrilled with the overall look, but I got several complements on it. This is a neat top but don't expect perfectly clear print and save it for cooler summer days."
4.0,"I really like this vintage style jacket of Finejo! The style is so stylish, elegant and casual! I like the combination of synthetic leather being and cotton blend with wide lapel. The side zipper is adding beauty to it but the zipper is not big and heavy duty though. I also like that it‚Äôs long sleeves and it‚Äôs made well. The only problem is that the sleeves are quite tight so I cannot properly bend my arms. I should have bought 1 size up. However, the body of the jacket fits well on my size. I stand 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weighs 118 lbs. I usually wear Medium size shirts like Guess, Gap and Nike but I wear Small size CK Coat.<br /><br />I really like the construction of this jacket. It‚Äôs soft and thin so this is ideal during spring and fall. The black lining is made of polyester and stitched well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest/unbiased review during its promotional period. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own. I was under no obligation to post positive feedback. I am simply sharing my opinions the same as I would have if purchasing the item at full price. I will update my review as soon as I encounter some issues with the product."
4.0,Love love love this! Material is a little cheap but overall can‚Äôt wait to wear it to work and is very comfy!
4.0,I love this product I just wish it was a bit longer it would‚Äôve been better if it had more length on it
4.0,"These bracelets are easy to put on and take off, and they are very comfortable.  They are<br />a nicer quality than I expected and made great gifts."
4.0,it was shorter than expected but the fabric was nice and thick.
4.0,Looks like the picture but was WAY bigger than I expected. It's humongous on my little wrist.
4.0,"I have this top in 3 colors (pink, green, brown) and they are pretty close to TTS, but the pink one is larger than the green and the green is slightly larger than the brown. All are size M. Material is pretty thick which I like so they don‚Äôt feel cheap. I have to wear a strapless bra with these, tried a racer back and I can still see the straps in the front so keep that in mind when purchasing!"
4.0,"I love this little shirt. Be careful washing it, it shrinks quite a bit."
4.0,"Just received it so a little biased review from first glance. It looks nice and gives you the edge of &#34;I used to be in the military&#34; look ha! Other reviewers have had some troubles with this watch (research them) so I will update later. Easy to set up and use. It is big though, I had a big watch but the dial piece on this completely covered it up excluding the square piece so be prepared. Now I'm not a twig nor a body builder but right now it is on the second to last hole on the band closest to the dial face so be prepared to cut mini holes if you need more.<br /><br />-Dial does rotate as featured.<br />-Does 12/24 style time on digital<br />-Stopwatch<br />-mm/dd/yyyy<br />-alarm"
4.0,"This is basically a round piece of felt cloth that has two holes where your arms go. Not bad for a basic coverup. I might do some embroidery on it to perk it up, maybe add a buttonhole/button or some kind of clasp. It might be good when it's freezing at work and I need my arms free for working on my computer."
4.0,"Very nice band. I have a thick wrist and it fit nicely in the second to last hole. The finish is very well done. The tone of the hardware is not exactly like the rose gold watch, but pretty close; a little more lilac. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, so I can‚Äôt really attest to durability. So far so good. I wish they had more colors for my size. Only black and blue were available when I ordered."
4.0,"It is a good quality sandals.  Unfortunately, my son's feet are too wide for these sandals."
4.0,"very good seller, product is ok for the price, the earring are too big for my taste."
4.0,They r super cute sturdy and I luv them. I am normally a 9 1/2 but the 9 worked (read other comments on sizing)
4.0,I've got into anything with wings. I've received several compliments. The hook wire is wide. Place plastic pieces on the to keep fro losing
4.0,"Fit well, light, pretty thin, and dried fast. Good value but don't care for the branding."
4.0,L/XL Fits 5' 5&#34; size 8/10 perfectly.  Nice navy color.  A little shiny rather than matte.  Washing/drying doesn't shrink leggings but makes the leggings fuzzy and worn looking.
4.0,Very cute blouse!
4.0,Really tight in the posterior area.
4.0,Fabric is thin and shirt is small for the large size I would order up a size or two when you order. Other than that a very good product.
4.0,"It fits good if you have small bra (A, B) I am C and I can wear this dress with a non cushion bra."
4.0,"Very cute dress that hides your flaws mostly. Everything on it fit well expect for the back since I have a booty. It tends to ride up if the back of you have any junk in your trunk. Still really like the dress, I will just have to wear shorts of some sort underneath"
4.0,My son loved them and they fit perfect for him.
4.0,"I liked it very much. Just as advsrtised. The size was perfect, the inscription was wonderful."
4.0,My mother enjoys her gift.
4.0,"Soft, comfy, warm."
4.0,"I like the shirt in general, the quality is good.<br />But I usually wear size XS and this shirt fits perfectly on my waist and everything, but the sleeves are so tight, that I can't even get in. I ordered the same shirt in S now, hopefully it will fit."
4.0,"It was exactly as pictured, however, the texture is very rough, so don't wear it against your neck if you have sensitive skin. The Hebrew lettering & tzitzit are just fine. Next time, I will pay a little more for a raw silk or wool tallit."
4.0,"Can't beat it for the price! Super cute, as pictured. Fabric is a little on the heavy side. That is fine, as I gold the gold/black one to wear in fall. The dress has a little stretch to it.<br /><br />I ordered a medium. I am 5ft4inches, 135 pounds. 34E bust. I have an hourglass figure. Having such a large bust I normally order a size up. This dress feels about a quarter to a half size too large. Hoping after a hot wash it'll fit a little better.<br /><br />Overall I love it. Can't wait to wear around Halloween. Also my cat likes it quite well, so double win.<br /><br />In my attached photo, I'm wearing it immediately after having received it."
4.0,"These are awesome shirts, really. Great fit for me (42 inch chest, 32 inch waist), and I get compliments on them. But, after a few washings on cold and light drying cycles, they do shrink prominently. Overall, 4 stars for the fabric and initial fit. I do keep buying these, often."
4.0,Really nice you can change to what ever color you feel like wearing. Also the cat eye is nice because you can adjust to however tight you want. Very Happy with both orders
4.0,Purchased this for my 7 year old I usually like to buy stuff bigger to last him longer but this sweater was just the right size for him and it was a Medium most likely going to have to purchase a Large soon.
4.0,Happy with purchase. Hope it launders well.
4.0,"Nice cheap belts!  Fit is smaller than described, had to return first order for larger size"
4.0,"Super cute and comfy, but a little awkward looking in groin area if you are over the age of 30. I just tied a sweater around my waist. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 145 lbs. bra size 38 C. Liked you can adjust zipper to show as much or as little of bust you want."
4.0,Nice quality but too big even with the extra links removed. Was able to return it for a refund.
4.0,"The vest seems to be well made.<br /><br />Sizing runs small. I wear a men's large shirt; this vest in XL is too small for me. It is also short in length.<br /><br />The two pockets are sewn from the seam where front & back meet. as such, they are situated behind natural hand positioning.<br /><br />Go big or go home."
4.0,Color faded after a few washes.
4.0,It was a great accessory for my son's costume.
4.0,My granddaughter loved the ring.  I might buy it again.
4.0,Purchased this for my bf and he likes the fit. It's comfortable and fits true to size.  The tag says Nineteen Ninety One by Cotton On which was a pleasant surprise. The only issue with this is how the pockets are positioned. My bf's phone is constantly falling out when he sits down.
4.0,Nice but more flimsy than I expected. Very spacious inside
4.0,"I noticed this set ran a bit small, mostly the top. The material is soft and the pattern/print was exactly as shown. It‚Äôs cute and comfortable, but if you are looking for the fit in the photo, size up. It does shrink a bit in the dryer as well."
4.0,"These are cute gloves but a little shorter than I would have liked.  Think they would be more appropriate for a more petite woman (I am 5'10"")."
4.0,This is a great long sleeve shirt. It is a little bit small but not bad. the print is high quality and looks as pictured.
4.0,"I recently got a back tattoo and wanted something to show it off with, the material wasn't what I was expecting. Very sheer, so if you're uncomfortable with that, this isn't for you."
4.0,"I got these for my husband to wear with his dress/loafers and he loves them!!!! Good quality socks, compared to some others I have purchased for him, and he loves how comfortable they are."
4.0,"Clasp is a bit off-putting,  but when you figure it out it works fine."
4.0,"Dress is very flattering, I love it! The color is NOT what is on the picture though. I ordered red and it was definitely bright pink, it is a very nice bright pink though and I would definitely recommend buying a slip to go under because it is also see through."
4.0,"Super soft fabric, but wish it was a little longer"
4.0,a little thinner than I like
4.0,"Pretty snug at first, but they stretch out.  A nice little something when wearing open-toed shoes, that's not too hot during the summer."
4.0,Product looks just like picture very pretty romper fit is a little small but not enough to return hate back zipper but will live with it because I like item
4.0,"I just finished the skiing Rudolph model. The printing/ink is very nicely done, the instructions are clear, and the functionality is superb.<br /><br />The only problem is that there were 3 missing pieces from the model--they not even printed on the card stock. 2 minor pieces--21 & 22 are tiny structural supports for the arm. They are hidden and we're not crucial.  Part 40a, however, is Rudolph's santa cap which is supposed to cover a tab.  I suppose I'll have to make one myself."
4.0,"This is made of very nice microfiber.  One side has an elastic string with a lock so you can pull the end closed and actually use the warmer as a hat.  If it were longer, I would give it 5 stars.  It is not long enough to use as a balaclava, it is only about 10.5 inches long."
4.0,"Very nice, flowy, sheer so you will need slip. I like it, very much!"
4.0,chain it a bit clunky and hard to keep strait and you will need to as its like a bike chain on your neck. long chain is really.... long gave it as a gift and my friend loved it. had he not i would have said 3 stars because they chain is bad bad heavy and hard to keep in line. if you like a thug level big chain go for it lol.
4.0,I was looking for a new Michigan shirt to wear for sporting events. This shirt fits good but the quality is okay. It wasn't totally what I was expecting when it came in the mail. I worry as time goes on the material may fall apart. I will be careful how much I wash this shirt.
4.0,"I wanted a strapless bra that does not show under dresses. I have seen this one on Amazon, and I have seen the pictures from other reviewers, so  I decided to try it out. I have ordered the beige color in Mango shape. I read that some people said to order larger size. My cup size is C but I ordered D just to be safe. It fits okay. So I recommended you to order larger size especially if you are chubbier in the breast area.  I have wore it to try it and give you my review. The silicon was super adhesive for the first 20 minutes, but then it started to loosen. They say that it is reusable but I do not know if it will last for multiple usages. The first time I have used it, it felt weird at first. I did not feel secure and all the time I have felt that it is going to slip or change place. I am not sure if I am going to wear it out for hours, because whenever I move it un sticks from the sides and I have to go and check it and fix it in place again.<br />I feel that this is going to be hectic for long time usage.<br />Overall, I think it is okay based on its price, but I will not take the risk and wear it for parties.<br />Disclaimer, I have received this product at a discount rate in exchange of my honest review.<br />Hope you guys find this helpful."
4.0,"A little thin,  material wise,  but fits wonderfully."
4.0,I truly like this. The colors are rich and it had decent weight to it. My only concern is that a few tiny beads fell and I hope I don't lose an more of them.
4.0,"I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  All opinions expressed are solely my own and have not been influenced in any way by outside sources.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, short,  black robe. I received the 16/18 XL.  I am a size 16 and it barely closed for me.  Fits fine around the waist but did not stay closed around the hip area.  Left a nice V opening at hip height and lower.  Sleeve came to just below the elbow on me. Length - to mid thigh. Includes black tie belt.  Material is a soft satin which is light weight.  Does not include pockets.  Looks well made.  Strong seams and sturdy construction.<br /><br />All in all, a good robe, but if you are a curvy girl like me who is large in the hips, be prepared."
4.0,"Great ring. I'm not sure what it's made of but it is sturdy. Doesn't turn your fingers green either, which is something you'd usually see in rings this low in the price range."
4.0,Pretty good for the price. I'm 6' 170 LBS and wear a 34 - 32 jeans and the large fit good. I wore them once in 55 degree weather and they were warm.
4.0,Well improved vision. Nice colors. Good fashionable pair.
4.0,The quality of this was great but it was far too large. I am a size 12 and ordered a size xl. It was so big on me that maybe even a medium would have fit better. I am also 5'9&#34; and weigh 190 if this helps any of you other gals in your ordering process. The chest area is not ideal for bigger busted woman either. I am a 34 DDD and this did not contain the girls. I ordered the xl hoping to help with my chest issues but it was still a small area for breasts.
4.0,"UPDATE: You can cinch up the shoulder strap to make it snug- so the bag's a little above your waist. You just have to pull the shoulder pad through the clip. However, this only works if you pull it all the way through, then the two clips are butted together, so you basically have one short setting, not adjustable shortness. If that makes sense.<br />I've been using this as a work bag for about a month. I'm not hard on it but I do carry some heavy gear. So far it's holding up well. Feels solid, no flimsy stitching or thin walls. Overall I'm very satisfied with it, and while it's early in its life, I've had a lot of lower end duffel bags show wear and tear very quickly- with this, so far so good. Two things of note- the shoulder strap, which is sturdy with metal hardware, is pretty long. The shortest I can cinch it up is about as long as I'd ever want it, and I'm 6'2&#34;, so something to keep in mind. Also, there are no dividers or side pockets, which I like, less stitching, zippers, panels to get in the way and/or break down. There's one small flap pocket in the inside center of one long side, but it won't hold much- about the size of a sandwich bag. Probably the only reason I didn't give it the fifth star is the shoulder strap- I'd prefer to be able to take 6-12&#34; of slack out of it. Otherwise- I'm very satisfied. Sidenote- if you're on the fence on the size, this is about the size of a large gym bag. I ordered the 30&#34; one (maybe not available on Amazon, and I could have fit inside. It was like a hockey bag."
4.0,"Overall, I'm very happy with this dress. It lost one star because despite being a perfect fit everywhere else, the elasticized waist is a good two inches higher than my natural waist, which means it generally rides up right underneath my bra.<br /><br />Otherwise, the dress is perfect and I love it. The stitching is well done, and the material has a really nice weight to it. It's got almost a linen feel to it, or like a raw sort of cotton fabric? It's not flimsy and it doesn't feel cheap.<br /><br />It's even a perfect tea length for me and I'm 5'1 -- this is so rare! I just wish the waist band was two inches lower. It would make such a huge different.  It's such a shame, because it's so perfect otherwise. I'm going to try sizing up and I'll update my post."
4.0,The elastic in the waist is to tight. I will order a size up. Other than the waist they are very nice.
4.0,Muy bueno producto.  Gracias por el regalo .
4.0,"very light weight  ,,small  watch,,,  case  seems  like is made of plastic,<br />the good part is,, easy  to see  the hour ,, and  so far  is keeping  the right  time<br />the price is super good ,, wont  brake  anybody's  bank ..."
4.0,"i love the color. my bf and i got our initials for eachother and they are super cute, just don‚Äôt get them wet the gold plating on it will come off. Did not ever discolor my skin :))"
4.0,Absolutely like the style of these glasses. If they came in Polarized lens i would buy all of the styles.<br />Fit well - color is nice
4.0,"good slipper, but runs a bit large; adjustability helps"
4.0,"I like it except that it is too small to shut all the way with my larger sunglasses. But they still stay in the case. Also, it comes with 2 cleaning cloths."
4.0,"I came across these pants while looking for a comfortable pair of boot legs to wear on the plane for my up coming trip to Switzerland.  Following the size chart I first ordered size 3xl (I'm  5'6"", 200lbs - 38D-34-46) they were way to big and long so I returned them.  I really liked them so I decided to reorder them in a smaller size but before doing so I posted a size question.  Both a customer and the company responded.  The customer's response was great and on point! Although she weighed less then me (about 35lbs less), she told me she had purchased a size XL which was a little big on her.  The seller suggested I purchase size XXL giving the measurements listed on their size chart.  I chose to order the XL and they fit perfect just as the customer said! Had I gotten the XXL as suggested by the seller they would have been much too big for me just like the 3XL. That said please know because THESE PANTS RUN VERY LARGE.  They have a nice yoga/workout pants feel however they have no compression and therfore fit relaxed and loose not hugging the body at all. They do fit nicely on the waist and butt.They are made of polyester and spandex with 4 way stretch.  I love that they do not bulge at the waist and are flexible when moving.  I can't wait to wear them.  If you decide to purchase a pair, I suggest sizing down and or using my size info listed in this review as your guide because the seller's size chart is not accurate.  Hope this helps! Stay safe and healthy."
4.0,Comfy sock.  Fits great too.  I love wool socks.
4.0,Dress measurements in sizing info were accurate and dress fit perfect.
4.0,Almost worth buying a new watch instead of this.
4.0,"I love these,  but they were to small"
4.0,i love it. this is what i want every time. he has very nice and imfrecciv mirror. it loke very nice
4.0,"Being lucky enough to live in Orlando & have many season passes of all kinds, lanyards are important to my family. Capt Marvel was bought to sport one of the UOAPs at our home. It works. They only disappointment is in the thickness (hmmmm)... in fairness it‚Äôs probably clearly stated in the dang item details. Guess I just got too excited with the find to look at or fully process them!"
4.0,"just a tad snug in the leg, otherwise, they are great"
4.0,"Good quality, only complaint is lenses fall out easily.  However, they are just as easily put back in.. and when you get 3 for this price, how can you complain?"
4.0,I love this evening bag . It's big enough to hold your cell phone and others
4.0,"I was having problems trying to find a belt that fit me. So when I found this belt I was intrigued. This belt promises the ability to easily shorten it to your desired width. You are able to cut the belt to the desired length then simply attach the clip back on. It works well. Simply poking holes into the newly shortened belt will complete the process. I'm the end it is a good process and works well. The belt itself is double sided. It has a black side and a brown side to fit with your various outfits. It isn't too large and fits well into my belt loops. The only problem is that if you cut it too short, there's no going back. In the end, I recommend this belt. It has an interesting concept and it executes it well enough.<br /><br />I hope my review can be helpful for a future buyer. If my review is helpful, please don't forget to click the &#34;YES&#34; button below. Thank you."
4.0,"I love the dress, decent length but to small"
4.0,The kid loves it. Didn‚Äôt come with a carbon filter. The pocket for the filter is pretty small. It is warm but comfortable.
4.0,Great look great price
4.0,"This is pretty and as described, but it is very hard to tell what it is (the heart) when you're wearing it because of the lack of contrast between the heart and the ziggy crystals on it.  Quality is fine, just not pleased with how it looks in person."
4.0,"Fun hat for a toddler. Kid likes it. Since it's not lined, it's good for transitional weather"
4.0,"I think this is sized for kids‚Äô noggins, but it fits so I‚Äôll sport it."
4.0,"They are lovely, a little smaller than expected but I like them."
4.0,"The leather seems to be real. It's really soft. They run small. I have small hands and they were tight.  However after putting them on and off they seem to have stretched a little. I think after wearing them for a bit they ccx will be perfect. The lining us thin but seems to be warm. I'm not sure it's real cashmere though. It seems a little scratchy.  All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase. Would recommend."
4.0,"These are somewhat long for me--but I have short legs for my 6 foot height. However, I do wear a size 12 shoe, and this has extra material at the toe area when the heel is seated.<br /><br />If I unroll them up my leg and don't pull too hard on them, they fit without wrinkles or folding over at the top.<br /><br />That being said, they definitely help to reduce swelling in my lower legs and keep my legs from aching."
4.0,"Gift for my nephew, he did some powers with it, got me some birthday cake, all in all, nice glove."
4.0,I should have ordered a smaller size because it‚Äôs a little loose.
4.0,The hat style is tall and the size is kind of large. The material and the hat made is perfect.
4.0,The hat fit a little to small but was the correct color!
4.0,love the shirt!  it would get 5-stars if it was a little bit longer. I expected a tunic top to be long enough to cover at least the top 1/3 of the thigh.  This covers only to bottom of hips and I am short-waisted.
4.0,"Pretty skirt, nice material and flow but was hoping that the pleating would have been a little smoother and not as &#34;puffy&#34;."
4.0,"Good quality material for tie clip. However, the engraved initials are incredibly small. It is hard to make out individual letters (they are much smaller than what is pictured on the website). Otherwise, it looks nice!"
4.0,"These are well made and I love the colors and sizing, but they are a little too flared and I have issues getting them in my ears."
4.0,Fits ok... Kinda big but comfortable. Nicely made perfect flowing material
4.0,Its cute!
4.0,"It was not as ""brightly colored as it looked on the computer screen."
4.0,One of the gloves ripped when I was trying to tighten it
4.0,Was in Maui and didn't have time to shop I have keychains from everywhere i've been now I have one from Hawaii
4.0,"Loved this dress, perfect for the beach, it is just a little see through."
4.0,Really cute. A little bigger than I expected but not too bad.
4.0,I knew ordering this I had to buy larger then I wear in close but they have this in 5 x so I went for it it fits I normally wear a 2 x
4.0,"Super cute swimsuit- cuter in person! However it's way too small , so I have to return. I am a medium and normally always wear size 8. I read the reviews about ordering a size up , but I have a small bust so was was worried the top would be too big. I wish I would have went up a size."
4.0,"Bought this for a Halloween costume. I wear size 13/14 pants, I am bottom heavy, so I ordered a XXL and it fit perfect with. Material was A little thinner than I expected, had to wear panty hose under, but overall happy with it. Loved that it wasn't a plain white color"
4.0,"I liked this skort a lot!  Nice fabric & very soft!  But it runs a little big; depends I guess. I usually wear a 10 but sometimes a 12. The Large was too big for me.  I can't return for a size medium (I don't think?) because the seller supposedly isn't selling same item now, and only 1 available is for $21 MORE than I paid!"
4.0,"Great for long torso! These do fit a bit small, but I expected that since they are supposed to snatch you up! They are pretty comfortable and I have had no issues wearing them all day. If you want a more comfy fit I suggest sizing up. I wear these under jeans and dresses and you can‚Äôt tell I have them on. Overall I‚Äôm pretty satisfied."
4.0,"It‚Äôs obviously adorable but the little chain thing it came with kept coming undone. I had to just put a key ring through the hole. Also, when I use it I have to pull it back a little or else the whole key won‚Äôt go in the lock."
4.0,Mask is pretty big and covers lower part of face well. Its not for smaller faces though. I wear filter underneath for additional coverage as its quite thin.
4.0,"What sold me on this was the fact that it's from Big Cat Rescue. Its a beautiful little bracelet. Only one recommendation. It is on the large side. Not the beads, but the diameter. I'd maybe remove a bead or two and it would fit perfect! I've got pretty big hands, and this still slips a little too far down. I use my other bracelet to hold it up."
4.0,Beautiful skirt but is a bit long.
4.0,have had this on my watch for a few weeks now. No chipping of the paint. I would give it 5 stars but adjustments are time consuming and very limited.
4.0,"I really like the color, style, and quality of fabric. I ordered the size based on other reviews and the fact that I wanted it to be oversized.  As with anything orginally in Asian sizing, expect to go up at least 2 sizes in American sizes, especially if you have a larger chest or hips."
4.0,Loved this dress. A little more fitted than a swing dress. Wonderful material. does not wrinkle easy.  Got many compliments. I put a cardigan and brown boots with this and it looked great
4.0,Very cute socks but they didn't fit right.. Very tight.. Seems like these were irregular socks cause I bought the exact same a couple of months earlier and they fit just fine.
4.0,"These earrings are pretty. They are not as bright a green color as they look in the photos. In reality they are more of a dark green. I still like them though. I just wish they were a little lighter and caught the light better. The quality is good.  I got them because they reminded me of emeralds, which I love but can't afford. These are a much more affordable substitute. Even though they are green, they will go with pretty much any color outfit.  I'm wearing a teal colored top today and the earrings look fine with it. I like that I can wear them with anything and they look nice with my hair up or my hair down.  I should also note that I do love onyx. Both black onyx and other colors it comes in.  I'm somewhat into the healing properties of stones and gemstones and onyx is good for driving away negative energy.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Is very soft and hangs nicely.
4.0,Seems to work okay.  It is a little loud.  I am anxious to see how long it last.
4.0,"Great swimsuit, my only complaint is that the band along the bottom of the suit is kind of loose, but that may have been fixed by ordering a smaller size.  I just ended up taking it to my alterations lady to fix."
4.0,Nice warm jammies
4.0,"This is a nice bag, but the handles are NOT long at all.  Actually, they're a little short to wear the bag comfortably over my shoulder.<br /><br />I am updating my review to account for the seller's response to my comments. The seller contacted me almost immediately to address my concerns and my issue with the bag was resolved immediately, with no hassle."
4.0,I'm not sure yea
4.0,"I've never tried compression socks before, but thought they might be helpful hiking with a bad ankle. I hurt my ankle pretty bad in college, and it's just never been the same. I am extra careful with it when hiking and exercising. I was very happy with the support it gave my ankle as well as how &#34;less-tired&#34; my feet and legs were after walking all day.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with them and will pick up a few more pairs. They are comfortable, even if they aren't super stylish."
4.0,"Nice size hoops, not sparkly or shiney if they were buffed more I would had given them 5 stars"
4.0,"Large, cute.<br /><br />Ordered two pairs for a party for myself and a friend.  One of them the post was off.  Crazy glue fixed that fast."
4.0,A little big on me. I will just tuck a camisole in to keep it from slipping.  I like the color.
4.0,"The material pills easily, but I have gotten compliments each time I have worn it."
4.0,"I got this sweater in the cream color, I can‚Äôt remember what it is called, (the one on the model) but it is a great winter white if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for. It is very warm and the lining is really nice throughout the body and hood of it. The arms are a bit tight. I usually order a large in tops because I like them looser but this one is pretty fitted on me in the large. You should probably order a size up in this in my opinion. The quality is nice and the cut is nice although slightly small. I will definitely order in another color in a size up next time."
4.0,The draw string is a bit flimsy but otherwise a good product/
4.0,"These Lace Boy Shorts are super cute and the colors are very pretty. They are all lace except a small piece of cotton lining in the crotch area. The lace is very soft and seems of very good quality. Unfortunately, they run a bit small. I got these for my daughter who typically wears a size Large. These, in my opinion, look to be comparable to a size small. I could tell taking them out of the package that they were not going to fit her. I definitely suggest ordering 1-2 sizes larger than you normally wear. Other than the sizing being off, they are beautiful panties and very sexy. I ended up giving them to my best friend and she normally wears a S-M and she said they fit her real good. Said they were very comfortable and sit on her low enough where they don't show out of her pants when she bends over or anything. She has worn them all and washed them twice now and said they are holding up very well.<br />** I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"Decent quality, but the sleeves seemed short in relation to the torso"
4.0,"It is see through, but nothing a slip couldn‚Äôt fit. I love this dress tho!"
4.0,"Very comfortable!! Only problem is a very strong odor of rubber that hasn't gone away in over a week,üö¥üèø"
4.0,"They arrived and everything works. It has different colors to choose, he only has to strap it works great for him since he doesn't like to tie his sneakers. Only reason I'm giving a 4 is because I am not letting him out on until school begins, so I can't say its comfortable for my child."
4.0,I used to buy Kathleen Kirkwood shoulder pads but sadly discovered she passed away. I wanted a small thin shoulder pad to give my clothes a better look and these shoulder pads did the job.
4.0,"Lets be honest.  This looks a little funny on me personally, but I still love it and will rock it.  I think this will be perfect for the winter.  I live in the South and do not really need weather wear, but it does get a little colder for a month or so.  This will be great to grab and go as I always wear my hair up in a ponytail."
4.0,"I usually wear a 1X but decided to order this dress in a 2X after reading reviews, glad I did, it fit perfectly and was made from very good material.  The color (blue) was beautiful.  I would recommend this dress."
4.0,I liked the scarf but it had a pulled thread. I was not too happy about that.
4.0,It might be a little heavy for here in Florida. Fit is good. Very attractive.
4.0,Very pretty.  Got lot's of compliments at work.  A little shinier than I expected.
4.0,Great product; we switched it to a different cord for a more authentic look but otherwise it's great!
4.0,"Tiny and delicate, very pretty for costume jewelry!"
4.0,Definitely use as costume.. very light and seems to run small.
4.0,"Very pretty, the chain did break but was easily repaired."
4.0,"Super soft. Well made. A little warm for GA summer‚Äôs, but love them!"
4.0,"The product seemed to be of very good quality. Size was true (ordered M for my 5.2 / 115lb frame), but just did not look good on me. Return was very easy."
4.0,"This fit good, but it ran a little small. I have a 1.5 year old with a normal sized head and I got a size up, and it was snug. When we washed it, I put it away and didn't think about it until I pulled it out for another trip and the rivots were rusted on the sides for air flow and had stained the hat orange in some places."
4.0,good gift for the individual I gave it to.
4.0,"So far very happy with this. Curious to see how the color holds up over time or how susceptible it is to scratches.<br />I paired it with a black frame as well.<br /><br />I only have a couple issues:<br />1) with it is the supplied pins. They fit, however the tab that is used for putting the pin in is way too big. Actually stands out too much and rubs on my wrist. Much bigger/longer than originals.<br />2) sizing it isn't overly difficult but does take a fair bit of effort to use the tool to punch out the link pins to the point where i was worried about damaging it.<br />Shipping was incredibly fast."
4.0,Came a few days earlier than expected. Thank you for that. The pockets are tiny and that was slightly disappointing. The fabric is super shiny which I am ok with but because of that I do wish I got in a different color there rather than black. The maroon would have been beautiful. The top of the dress has weird bra cups so I need to cut them out and replace them. The fit at the waste was perfect. I got a size 16. Also the dress isn‚Äôt super long and it hits the floor perfectly.
4.0,"I am 5'6""and 128 lbs, and I purchased a small.  The dress looks exactly like the photograph...It's a great little party dress.  I am happy with it (especially for the money).  I will wear while dancing on an upcoming cruise."
4.0,"Very good quality plastic with more pockets than I expected.  Should last a long time, and also comes with a spare for the future as well"
4.0,Love this top perfect for that bashful bikini wearers. Tops alittle long and bra too has a few stray strings but it's so cute and flattering on.
4.0,the most comfortable and beautiful sandals i‚Äôve brought didn‚Äôt know i would like them so much thank you
4.0,"Love the slip, hate the tag.<br />The slip is so soft and comfortable.<br />Perfect under dresses.<br />The tag is irritating on the skin. Why would a manufacturer put a scratchy tag on an under garment???!<br />I'll never understand. Stamp it!!!! I'd gladly pay more if that is the problem!<br />It's not easy to remove either. I'll end up teasing it off with a razor blade.<br />I'll order more of this slip but end of removing each and every uncomfortable, scratchy oh so annoying tag."
4.0,"it was a gift for a new mom , even though the hat was missing i still was short on time, to go to baby shower and gave it anyway. they where out of stock so it was an honest mistake"
4.0,Worried it‚Äôs going to shrink when I Wah it
4.0,"Made in China. Polyester/ rayon/ spandex.<br />This fabric is light (thin), soft, and drapey. I usually wear size S to M and this fits me nice and loose which is what I was aiming for. It feels comfy without looking grungey.<br />The seams are unfinished as you can see in the 2nd pic. But it does not feel cheaply made.<br />I find the gray swatch on each leopard sleeve to be a bit strange looking. But otherwise I love the look of this shirt."
4.0,Honestly really like the shirts inwould buy again
4.0,"I like the suit, but it did seem to run larger than expected."
4.0,"After purchasing and losing many sterling silver toe rings in the past, decided to buy less expensive ones. So far I'm very happy with these. They're pretty, shiny and I like the various designs that I received. Can't speak to they're durability as yet, but I'm glad to have bought these. Hopefully will stay shiny."
4.0,"I was a little doubtful about getting this after reading mixed reviews, but figured I'd give it a shot since there were free returns with Prime. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived though! For the price, I thought the gold buckle itself was great quality. It may not be the strongest material, but it's not &#34;flimsy&#34; as other reviewers have described it. The elastic is not the prettiest material, but what stretch elastic belts are? The elastic looks like it will hold up well. The belt goes beautifully with a number of my dresses -- not too tight to create those unsightly lumps and bumps, but tight enough to stay in place. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a similar product from Allegra K!"
4.0,"I love the fit and quality of the dresses I purchased. They make me feel pretty, classic, romantic and so feminine!  I‚Äôve found this shop to have the best  retro clothing I‚Äôve ever seen!  You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
4.0,"I ordered a large because I wear a medium or small, but I am always skeptical of this type of clothing, having been burned before by ridiculously small sizes.  It actually WAS a large, so I wear it to bed.  You just never know..."
4.0,"This is a cute sweater, i ordered one size up to give it an oversized look.<br />My negatives about it, the colors aren't as bright as shown in the photos, and I wish it was softer."
4.0,"Very comfortable and not too hot for warmer months. I am between a size 7.5-8 and the 7-8 fits perfectly. The elastic that holds your foot is too small though, so it doesn't let your heel touch the back of the bottom of the shoe. Sort of like those ballet flats that are bendy? I don't like that part so that's why 4 stars instead of 5. The soles aren't slick at all and I've had no problem on hardwood, laminate or linoleum. I appreciate that the soles are rubber so I can take the trash out quickly in them."
4.0,It's a great wallet but needs more slots.
4.0,Love this dress. Can be simple or can be dressed up.
4.0,The toddler this was a gift for absolutely loved the suit. But you could tell the material was thin and her mom said it's pulling some.
4.0,This dress is so cute! Bought it for family pictures. However the background is GRAY not white as the pictures look.  That was disappointing! The dress is huge! Size way down when u buy. Not sure what kind of material it is. It's slick n shiny. Probably wouldn't be too warm
4.0,"My fault, I did not notice in the description that some of the beads are copper. That will give me a rash around my wrist. Also, some of the other beads seem to have been treated with something to give them a specific appearance. Some of that material was already flaking of in the packaging and again when I was handling the bracelet. I had to return it due to the copper beads and the material flaking off."
4.0,"Comfy and warm but a bit snug on me. I wear a woman's size 9.5 shoe. The fabric inside tends to bunch up which makes it feel like there's something in the slipper. I bought these because I wore holes in all of my Old Navy slipper socks. I prefer the Old Navy ones but these are fine too. The more I wear them, the more I get used to them and like them."
4.0,These are really cute but slowly one by one they are falling apart
4.0,Nice comfy flip flops. My only complaint is they don‚Äôt have enough arch support. Cute flip flops
4.0,What I expected for the price. Super soft when they were new and a little rough after 5 washes. Also some miss-shaped things happening and it's had to fold because it's sticking together.
4.0,It‚Äôs advertised as having a hood. There was no hood on this product.
4.0,Fabric is super see through and it was large on me
4.0,very good for such a low price id buy again
4.0,"I LIKE IT - TOOK TOO LONG TO GET HERE BUT IT WAS COOL TO RECEIVE THEM WHEN I DID. THE PIECES ARE STRONG AND NICE TO TOUCH, THE ONLY THING i DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO IS THE LENGTH. I WISH THE CHAIN WAS ABOUT 4 INCHES LONGER, THEN IT WOULD BE PERFECTION."
4.0,Nice looking and feeling sweater. Runs a tiny bit small great weight - not too buy or too think. Color is great ( I got the coral colored one). Soft and nice on.
4.0,It's a little big than expected
4.0,Kind of drab
4.0,"Fits a bit small, half size would help, also the ‚Äústeel toe cap‚Äù inside the shoe would rub on my ‚Äúpinky‚Äù toe so I had to return them."
4.0,They were great except that they didn't fit. If they came in a longer size I would get those.
4.0,"Although I am tall, it was much shorter than I had expected it to be. It is very cute and I love it, just wish it was longer."
4.0,"I bought this to wear under my working uniform (kinda like how people wear long sleeves shirts under their scrubs), but I didn't want to buy those cotton or whatever other materials that people tend to purchase because those do not look flattering in my opinion and I feel like they fade pretty bad after wash. It surprised me how expensive these kind of basic black long sleeves shirts are, so yeah, these shirts are selling at pretty good deal for a pack of 3, about $11 each. I am usually size 4 or XS in US size, 34C and these fits me snug but very comfortable. Again, I use these for work and right now it's in the colder months so I can't tell for sure how well they are at absorbing moisture. But the fact that they looks flattering on body, comfortable on the skin and gentle on the budget are definitely enough to make me want to purchase them again. The shoulder is a bit wide for me (but I am on the pettie size so that's normal). The only reason I took away 1 star is because they do not feel as black as I want, like it's not jet black."
4.0,"Comfortable fitting jeans that don't ride up or pinch on the 'family jewels'. The recipient usually wears a 32x32, but the relaxed fit of these jeans is a perfect fit. He likes that the legs aren't tight in the thigh, and that the front pockets are deep rather than oddly shallow like some jean brands are doing. No shrinkage when washed or dried on low heat. The color isn't bad, though the pair we received are a good deal lighter than the image for the listing. The overall appearance is more like the color around the knees in the image with little whiskering or darker areas around the pockets or seams. Because of this the fabric really shows any dust, dirt, or stains that the wearer might encounter."
4.0,"Good frame design, color and dark lenses. Good fit. Wish it was a bit more sturdy."
4.0,These are gorgeous!<br />Awesome buy
4.0,Can honestly say I'm surprised. Tried it on right away and fit perfect. Wasn't too tight nor too small. I'm 5&#34;1 110 pounds and a 38B cup and it fit perfect. The straps were a little confusing but once you get it its easy. Haven't tried it in water but seems like it would hold up if its tied tight enough. Doesn't seem like it would be see through.
4.0,"Was perfect, material a bit delicate though"
4.0,"I love this umbrella  I do have a small problem with the automatic closer, but I can pull it closed."
4.0,Better quality than expected. True to size.
4.0,I love this dress. It's beautiful and stretchy. It's a tight dress though so I might have to shed a couple pounds around my gut for it haha.
4.0,"Cute shirt, material is not that comfortable"
4.0,Love these super light just wish they came in silver to
4.0,THis dress is nice but I am 5'9&#34; and it was too short
4.0,Wife liked them!
4.0,"Very comfortable and easy to slip on and off. The fabric snags a little, but not too bad."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, not stretchy so be mindful that at the waist it is pretty fit. Very fun and comfortable, got lots of complements while wearing it the only reason why I don‚Äôt git it 5 stars is that the material is too thin and kind of see through other than that is sexy and beautiful, I love it."
4.0,"Very high quality coin. Some kind of metal. However the coin in the movie is quite large, almost the size of Elizabeth's palm when she holds it. This coin is the size of a quarter. It will work for my party and as a fun piece of jewelry. But not authentic as expected. I also had to swap chains bc the chain is very short. No big, was easy to put on a longer one."
4.0,For gifts to international college students before their return to Japan.
4.0,"This backpack worked out great for my trip to Kauai.  I used it as a carry on for the plane ride, as well as for hiking and the beach.  Love the color.<br /> The size was perfect - I didn't want anything too big, but big enough to put a few items in it for hiking.  The outer side pockets worked great for our water bottles (16.9 oz).  Slightly larger bottles should also fit.  The straps were comfortable during the hikes and there is little bit of padding in the back of the pack.  This is not a heavy duty backpack - the material is lightweight.  I noticed that one of the straps is starting to pull away just a little bit and plan to stitch it up before it gets worse.  I stuffed it pretty good some days.  I think it is a good backpack for the price."
4.0,"These are great earrings. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because they were slightly bigger than I was expecting. I still love wearing them, and the service from Dragonfly Spirit Designs is great!"
4.0,Great bag! My wife loved it
4.0,Cute but design faded. Fits well
4.0,Was hoping for a mask to help with glasses fogging up. Great quality none the less
4.0,"These writings are really cute, with extremely vibrant colors for the summer. Their advantage is they are very light weight especially for earrings of this size.<br />However, the only one thing that is a little disappointing in the design, is that, when you wear the them, they are rarely straight, and you can rarely see them from the front as watermelons.. they flip a lot"
4.0,"Just as pictured, perfect fit"
4.0,Great variet and value for the price.  The only drawback is that the securing rings slide off causing the strap to flap open.
4.0,Love the way it feels although it runs a little big I'm 5' 2&#34; 153 lb and could've wore a small other than that love it
4.0,"I really like these Bohemian Hand-woven Beads Earrings. These earrings are well made for the price, light and comfortable for her to wear. I enjoy the fun color combination. They look exactly like the photo. I am very happy with these earrings and if they look like they would work for you, I would recommend picking up a pair."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and around 185 lbs right now. I initially ordered ‚Äútag size 2XL‚Äù and it was too small ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt even get it on. The 3XL fits much better. I wear a size 10/12 in pants and a M/L in shirts. This suit offers the coverage I wanted on my thighs, and I can‚Äôt really complain about much at this price point. I haven‚Äôt swam in it yet, but it seems like pretty good quality and all the stitching is nice and symmetrical."
4.0,"These rings are wonderful. I wear them when swimming, working, etc. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is they stretch out and fall off after a few uses."
4.0,"I read all the reviews before buying this for my husband and Im really glad I did. He usually wears a large in mens and so I got him an extra large in this sweater. It fits the slightest bit snugly but I think he likes it that way. He's 5'11'' and about 200 lbs. I think the XXL probably would have fit him even better, but this is fine. The fabric is thin, but looks great when layered with things. Hes very happy with it."
4.0,Loved the product. Just did not fit correctly.  I actually need a Sketcher slip on that has a small top to it.<br /><br />I actually really love Sketchers. Have a pair on right now..
4.0,"I LIKED THIS ITEM,  VERY NICE ONES PLEASE LET EVERYONE KNOW THESE ARE GOOD,  I WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED MORE"
4.0,good underpants
4.0,Bought this for my husband to add to his golf hat and he was thrilled. Nicely constructed and sturdy.
4.0,"It is 6&#34; too long, and I'm 5'7 1/2. Plus a 2&#34; high heel. Have to take it to be hemmed. Other wise very nice."
4.0,"Liked the style and definitely the low price,,,only thing I was disappointed with was the clarity"
4.0,Good product at a good rice.
4.0,A little too small but doable.
4.0,"Fit well, but one cap was slightly defective"
4.0,Would definitely recommend this dress. The only problem is that they need to made other colour available in this dress.
4.0,The memory foam in the bed of the slippers makes them super comfortable.  Being a slipper there is really no arch support but I can wear<br />them pretty much all day..  Also they wash nicely in the washing machine.
4.0,"Great material, strong yet flexible.<br />The size 14 fits more like a medium than a large, so you may want to take a larger size than usual..<br />None the less, I'm a satisfied customer!!!!!"
4.0,Nice lenses.  Not perfect fit but close
4.0,Love mask only complaint is whole package smelled like cigarette smoke
4.0,Nice for the price. As far it's ok!
4.0,"The wig was pretty thin, I wouldn't recommend if you have dark hair. I took it apart to sew into another wig i have so it was perfect for my project."
4.0,Bought for my husband. They were to small and I had to give them to my son.
4.0,"These extenders work well but are unfortunately a little wider than my bra, making attaching them a little problematic.  But, nevertheless, they do work."
4.0,"They stretch out a bit easily, but they hold up pretty well and fit as expected."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter's steampunk outfit.  She loves it.  The back is sketchy, but the front looks great."
4.0,Cute & Comfy for a girls Pj party
4.0,"Super cute, the only complaint is that the sticker in the crotch stuck to the suit and took forever to get off! Please use different stickers!!!"
4.0,"The blouse is great, especially for the price, but be aware of sizes- ORDER TWO SIZES UP. I am normally a M or sometimes S for the tops, but this one I ordered XL- good thing I did!"
4.0,"Perfect color for spring/summer! A little stiff when you first put it on, but softens with wear and quickly becomes very comfy. Great item and great value"
4.0,"Good combo for the price. Genuine leather, only one side to adjust."
4.0,Verry nice my daughter loves the sneaker
4.0,Was a bit big but still really cute.
4.0,I did not give 5 because of the sagging pockets.
4.0,these rings are really cool but some rings are way bigger than the others though
4.0,"Beautifully made and love all 4 of the crystals,"
4.0,"This dress is darling, and unique. Am 5'5 and 140lb and the medium dress is a tiny bit too big, but not a  problem just more comfortable.  The quality is a bit better than I expected, however the lining is very thin and a skirt slip is required. It's also a bit longer than expected but not a problem. Still very happy with it:)"
4.0,Walking and working
4.0,Fit as ecpected
4.0,"This is a really nice nighty, I call it that because I don't really qualify this as lingerie. It has pretty soft fabric, with a nice trim of lace. It isn't itchy and very comfortable. I like that it is sexy but not over revealing, so you can wear it as a shorter night gown. I personally would wear it nightly it's super comfy. When you don't wanna be in uncomfortable lingerie because face it they mostly are awful feeling and itchy. I ordered an xl and I'm usually about a 14-16 depending. This is a little larger which is fine so it's flowie. The color I ordered is very pretty and looks really cute. I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"While this dress has some extra room in it,  it is certainly comfortable. The fabric is soft and stretchy and hits modestly at the knee or a little below-at least for me.  It is very forgiving which is always nice.  I found the sleeves a bit long, but I'm bit very tall either.  I tried rolling up the sleeves, but the white inside shown through.  With it being long sleeve and Christmas decorations, it is best for the winter season. But it would make a great holiday dress to wear to a gathering or just because.  Overall, it is comfortable and wears easily<br /><br />I purchased this at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. these opinions and experiences are solely my own."
4.0,The color of the sunflower is fading
4.0,I love the fact that the brim of the hat have a wire so you can style it how you want.
4.0,"Surprisingly good quality! I sized up based on the reviews, it fit perfectly. I wasn't crazy about how open the slit is in the front so I returned.  It looks cute when your legs are staggered (like how the pictures show) but if you're just standing straight it looks a little weird."
4.0,"It has a dust filter and is anti-fog?  Yes!  It actually works, I was surprised.  This was one of those pandemic gimmics I'm using as safety for around my cnc which can get dusty."
4.0,very soft and sweet!  runs big!
4.0,"I bought this dress for a Great Gatsby Party and read a number of reviews. Based on those I read, I ordered a medium (usually wear a petite 8) and it fit perfectly. It might be short on anyone over 5'4&#34; especially if you are older as I am. I would not recommend it for anything other than a themed event. It is fine as a costume though."
4.0,I wish I had ordered more. I love it.
4.0,"I've had this top for a while now, so I can give a good review of how it holds up over time.  When I first bought it, I would have given it 5 stars.  It lost a star thanks to some fading in the wash and slightly shrinking. Even so, it's still really comfy and cute! I wear it all the time and love it!"
4.0,I like the socks but with my short legs these are a little too long.  My legs feel better with them on.
4.0,"I had already prepared myself that this dress wouldn't be the quality I was hoping for - but I am glad to say I was wrong! It fits great, looks great, and the fabric is a better quality than I had anticipated! I'm excited to wear this dress to an event, and keep it as a ""go-to"""
4.0,"Top is fantastic.  The necklace broke right after I took it out of the package, lost 2-3 of the chain links, had to purchase a connector to put the two sides of the chain back together. Otherwise, love the top, fits comfortable, soft material."
4.0,Bought this as a gift & and it was SO WELL received. I give it a 4 star because I ordered up a size & it was still snug.
4.0,Looks just like the photos! Always order a size up they had to give me a different size but still ended up being perfect! Pretty comfy for something that's cheap!
4.0,"Bought these for my husband who always complains about the light at night.  However, he forgot his sunglasses on a road trip on a very sunny day, and I pulled these out.  He immediately fell in love with them.  Evidently they work well during the day also."
4.0,"Super comfortable. Light weight. However, id order a half size up and then a million colors."
4.0,Beautiful band is stiff but it os not uncomfortable way better than apple
4.0,"So I really like these glasses because they‚Äôre retro and I have a wide face and they fit perfectly. However, I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars because there‚Äôs two imperfection or marks on the frame and they‚Äôre brand new"
4.0,"Cardigan is light weight and very soft and comfortable.  Ordered Large 1st time, but was too small, ordered XL and it fit perfectly. Would recommend ordering size larger unless you want it very form fitting.  I am senior citizen - showing my abs is not at the top of my wish list."
4.0,"they were really nice! i love them, but i have small earlobes so they were a bit too big . I used them as wonderful thumbtacks on a cork board of mine though. Wonderful product (:"
4.0,got it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it!
4.0,"A little large for a Steve Jobs costume (his glasses were smaller), but we will use these again for a Harry Potter Halloween costume."
4.0,"I love this ring, and I receive many compliments from friends and family about the unique style."
4.0,Shirt was smaller then the measurements were. The shirt is really nice !!!!
4.0,Ear elastic has plastic slides to make mask fit comfortably.  Copper nose plate reduces fogging on glasses.
4.0,This dress is slim fitting. I won‚Äôt wear this to work but would wear out on a date. Very form fitting and sexy but not work office attire unless you go a bigger size than what they recommend.
4.0,"This tactical belt is made with durable metal and an elastic web belt. The quality is solid and it looks great. I finally found a quality belt that I can depend on. The only part that I don't like is the two ends don't fit through the belt loops. You need to take the buckle off each time to get the belt around your waist, then reattach the buckle. Other than that, it's an excellent belt."
4.0,Adjustable fit.  Stays secure.
4.0,Decent quality. .. they were very prompt with the shipping... I will buy these again...
4.0,"Bought these for my granddaughter.  She looks so cute in them.  They fit perfectly, but after the third time washing them, part of the seam came loose on the bottoms.  So gramma just fixed them."
4.0,"This is a well made pajama set.  I ordered a large as I don't like tight elastic around my waist.  It seems to run just a little bit larger than some of the other sets I ordered from Amazon.  It washed well on delicate cycle, cold water and didn't shrink.  It says to line dry, which I do.  I think it could possibly be dried on low in the dryer, but might shrink some."
4.0,"I tried several similar round style glasses off amazon and these seemed to be the best bang for the buck. They're not premium shades BUT they're better than gas station cheapos. A decent quality and an excellent price. They were hauled around in a backpack for months without a case and held up well. The frame did eventually crack, but that was likely due to user abuse. Overall, a great value!"
4.0,"The color changing bag is so beautiful! The only issue I had was the strap was not long enough to wear on my hips where I like to wear them. I have to wear this up a little higher, which isn't so flattering. I usually wear a size 16 or XL-XXL, underwear size 8, if that helps you decide if this is right for you. You cannot replace the strap because it is sewing into the sides so I'll deal but only because it's a beautiful color changing bag."
4.0,Fits wonderfully- ordered normal size (42H)- I do not dry my bras in dryer so cannot speak to that. Looks good under clothes and is supportive and pretty
4.0,fit was great and good for the price but was shorter than expected. Still comfortable and works though.
4.0,I really like how it looks on. I'm 5'4 and had to wear heels with it but thats normal in most maxi dresses for me.
4.0,I bought this watch because I think it is very nice looking. Unfortunately it arrived missing pin that holds the band to the watch. Jewelers could not fix it because the holes in the watch were missing (no place for the pin to seat). I exchanged the  watch with Amazon. New one is perfect and keeps very good time (for an automatic).  Wife thinks it is beautiful.
4.0,I like the belt and it fits well but the belt loop keeper slides all over the place there needs to be a way to lock it down otherwise it's just too loose
4.0,It a nice tie but the tie is a little thick to tie but work able
4.0,Little bigger than I thought it would be
4.0,This top is worth the money.
4.0,"Aside from the fact that the tassle came loose from the earring the first time I wore these, and I was fortunate that it didn't get lost, I really like these.  The tassle itself is sturdy, they're a good length and I wear them frequently.  It's a good bang for a little buck.  If you buy them, I would recommend tightening the little connections before wearing."
4.0,"Necklace is very pretty and looks more expensive than it is. Only problem is the stones are aqua, brown, orange not purple, orange, blue. I was looking for a necklace with blue-- I will have to keep looking. But I like this one well enough to keep it."
4.0,"Loves the feel and fit, but the green color was gross on me üò¨ It‚Äôs a really muddy green...not like a pretty olive or army green. I would try one in a different color."
4.0,goof for gift
4.0,"This dress is really cute!  I ordered a med and a large,  I kept the med.  the reason I gave 3 stars is because the top on the med fit, but I liked the bottom of the large better.  The large was way too big on top and I am a 36DD 160lbs and 5'6&#34;. But I really like the dress, material is nice and has pockets."
4.0,I like the material but the size is very small. It was 18 but is really like 10. It‚Äôs better if they put a size chart also with waist inches to avoid returning product.
4.0,Comfortable and waaay cheaper than the ones from apple.  I think it feels better on the wrist also.
4.0,This dress fits perfect. I wore it to my business class and everyone gave compliments on it. Love Love Love
4.0,Didn't roll down.  Yay!  Little bit of a pantyline but with what I wanted to wear them with that didn't matter.  I'll order these again but the thong version.
4.0,Seems to fit a little smaller than I expected.  The arms are fitted and not as loose as they appear in the picture. Overall nice for the price.
4.0,"Very cute, fits well, wish the fabric was a little thicker."
4.0,"I debated not keeping this shirt even though i fell in love with the print instantly and had to have it.  It's borderline huge, dress like long.  I hoped to be able to wear with jeans/skinny jeans but it almost needs to be worn with leggings/tights only.  SO MUCH FABRIC.  However it's a decent fit in the shoulders/chest. It's just super long and 'a lined' just like a dress.  For reference i am petite, 5'1"" and 110 lbs, and i got the smallest size.  All that said, i wear it with leggings fairly frequently because it's so fun and colorful.  If you are a tall woman, you will totally rock this blouse and i'm envious!! :)"
4.0,"My new go to hat for outdoors. Blocks the sun well, easy to adjust for a perfect fit, and stays on in windy weather."
4.0,Its just like the picture but the bottom isn't very flattering
4.0,I loved all the little details but some part of it is mehh.. The top part and blazer are wayy to tight and I don't know where the black bow goes. The red bow scrunchie part would not fit in the hair and the hair was more coral than pastel pink.
4.0,A very nice keychain just bigger than I expected!
4.0,"Okay but not windproof. I haven't tried running in them yet, but using them for driving they don't really insulate all that well against a cold steering wheel on a really cold day. Wouldn't buy again as winter gloves."
4.0,"Just how it looks online. I haven't worn it yet, so far I have no complaints."
4.0,"This is a beautiful and delicate looking (yet sturdy) price if jewelry, I like it a lot, but I wish the leaf was slightly smaller."
4.0,"If you've ever owned a replica designer bag you will know the quality and feel of the texture.  This is just the same without the designer logos.  I honestly didn't order it to use, I am going to use the handles to repair another similar replica bag!  They seem strong enough to work for that use.  I will use the rest for other DIY projects."
4.0,These are very comfortable fits more like spandex so they fit close around the hips nice color for summer will buy more colors
4.0,"Style, office outfit"
4.0,Is a little bigger then expected will probably shrink in th ew wash. Its very comfortable to be honest I have cup size C makes me look pretty small. And its not super tight where I cant breath.
4.0,Fun to wear. A little bit itchy tho. Hopefully will soften after it‚Äôs washed a few time.
4.0,It‚Äôs very lite so I don‚Äôt sweat in this hot weather will work out fine for summer
4.0,very cute thin summer cotton socks
4.0,"I purchased a one size, the package has an S on it so I thought maybe it was a small but when I tried it on it fits loosely like a medium. I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 115 pounds."
4.0,Sit a little low on my face but like the glasses. Seem like good quality.
4.0,"Perfect for my 3 year old who is on the tall side ! Looser than I expected but nice, especially for the price!"
4.0,"The shape was cool, just too big for my face. Nice quality though."
4.0,About a week in the strap broke. Rigged it to work but wasn't that happy.
4.0,I love this shirt is perfect for me.  I have a small back and waist.  5'5 145 lbs.  If curvy/rolls on the tummy you won't like how form fitting it is.
4.0,"The back heel thing is going under my heel instead of behind it keeping my foot in. The slipper is too tight. I normally wear a size 12 and I got X large which is supposed to be good up to size 12.5. Feels like a size 11. I guess I'll be wearing these on half my foot in order to maintain circulation.<br /><br />Edit: I've broken them in a little and they now fit much better and don't feel overly tight. However, it's still a bummer that they barely cover your heel."
4.0,I just received the bracelet yesterday so a true review is not ready yet.  But it arrived as promised and looks as I imagined.
4.0,"LOVE these so much! They are squat-proof, breathable (they move with you), don‚Äôt give you a camel toe and SUPER flattering. They aren‚Äôt super compressive, which I like. Seamless leggings tend to be almost too restrictive. The waistband fits well, the top rolls down the slightest bit but still looks good and doesn‚Äôt give you a muffin top. I ordered a small and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 127lbs for reference, athletic build."
4.0,Highest praise possible: the product was better than I expected and relieved a lot of my fear about ordering clothing on line.
4.0,"Cute dress! I wore it when I was pregnant and I think it‚Äôs really flattering for the belly! I can say it is a touch too thick for my liking, for summer weather.  But still really cute! Would recommend."
4.0,Takes a second to adjust so it looks correct but once you have that down it is an easy way to cover up between the car and the beach and back. Or if you want to stop into a restaurant.
4.0,"Note that these are NOT spheres. They look like spheres from a distance, maybe, but they're just half pieces."
4.0,"Fit well, well made, women's swim bottoms."
4.0,"Fit fine; arrived fast. A bit shoddily made, with ends not stitched so may unravel. Will be sure to only hand wash when needed. Fine for the price, cheap.."
4.0,75kg fit
4.0,"These Lenses fit in perfectly. They look nice. And with this color it makes everything have a purple tint, I like it. One complaint I do have to make though, is that one of the lenses was a little scratched right out of the box. Upsetting to say the least. Overall not a bad pair<br /><br />I  was fortunate enough to receive this item at a discount in exchange for inspecting, testing, and reviewing. I received no compensation aside from the discount and have provided my honest unbiased opinion. I hope you've found my review helpful!<br /><br />Also I update all my reviews if I ever come across any issues, so you can trust this is the most recent appraisal."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, have a little smell.<br />Size: im a 6-feet tall guy, the length of the glove fits me, however its kinda loss. Another word to say this is, it might fits a fat hand more.<br />NO BUTTON. even it seem like so, the thing is just a logo, not a real button.<br />shipping: i chose the &#34;standard shipping&#34;, it arrived at the 4th business days."
4.0,"Solid frames, great lenses. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with photo chromatic lenses they may disappoint. These are high quality safety lenses but do not get extremely dark. So those bright sunny days riding into the sun may not be what you need. I still carry two sets, I prefer these as my primary with extra dark for the times I ride towards the sun. I highly recommend subtracting one star for the lense darkness."
4.0,"Fabric thickness/thinness is good, we love the bright color and the hood, and the delivery was speedy. The rashguard will definitely last however the outside has started to pill and it‚Äôs only been 2 days but it could be because he was using it while surfing. I would recommend as kids grow out of things fairly quickly anyways."
4.0,Very Pretty! But the chain looks very cheap. So I'm gonna get a different chain for the beautiful pendant.
4.0,Runs a little big in my opinion but is a favorite.
4.0,Very comfortable but unfortunately slides off the face.  I had to add ear loops to it.  Otherwise very comfortable and makes wearing a mask for school all day bearable.
4.0,"I am 5'9&#34;,  31&#34; inseam, Hips 40, waist 34.  They fit perfectly and are just the right length.  Very comfortable .  We'll see how they hold up to washing."
4.0,"I bought up a size, and glad I did.  It's a good, comfy 100% cotton sleep shirt!  The length is perfect.<br /><br />I wish there was a print less specific to winter or holidays.<br /><br />I wish the sleeves were a true 3/4 instead of just below the elbow."
4.0,Long wait for delivery but pleasantly surprised by the nice quality.
4.0,Preciosa lastima tan grande
4.0,"I bought these in a size 4 for my 10 year old granddaughter,  she says she just loves them. She said  her feet did not get wet walking  in the snow"
4.0,"These socks are so cute! They are a little big for my baby though, who's 15 months and about 22 lbs. She fits a size 4 shoe too if that helps any. I like that she can wear them year round (I use them as an added layer of leg warmth during the winter). I wish they had grippy bottoms though."
4.0,"For the price, it is a very nice dress."
4.0,"They fit very well (I ordered according to the size chart) and are comfortable. They certainly did the trick on a 13 hour flight, no swelling at all. All that said, on the long flight back home I felt quite constricted by them (even though they were not tight) and ended up taking them off. Think that perhaps it was just &#34;ramminess&#34; and certainly not an issue with the sock per say. Yes I would recommend them!"
4.0,Super cute dress. The only strange thing about it is the material. It kind of has a swimsuit feel to it rather than a cottony feel. I did notice that because of the material you can see everything jiggle...but with some control top panties this should help. I realize this may not be the case for everyone as I am a size 12/14.
4.0,"I ordered these after reading in GQ that metal collar stays are the best.  I received the package and the clear plastic container was broke.  Not really a big deal, the stays were fine.  But after using the stays I realized that the metal will poke you in the neck and can get uncomfortable.  This is not a product flaw, its just a personal preference.  I prefer a softer plastic stay that has a little give.  These are very nice stays for the money. They are a little thick but very strong!"
4.0,The colors are good. Liked the adjustable ear loop and under chin flap. Fits great.
4.0,Great fit. Love these. A little bit long though.
4.0,A little small on the sides. I feel that I would need an xxl to accommodate my D sized boobs.
4.0,Works fine hat now fits.
4.0,Loved the price. Wore with her homecoming dress. Certain pairs looked a little<br />Cheaper then others but she was happy.
4.0,nice colors... very very very thin
4.0,"Its gorgeous, I‚Äôm only giving it a 4 star because its see through but other than that is just like the picture"
4.0,Don't like the wristband. I have bought multiple watches just different colors. This was the only watch that had the Bracelet Watch Band Strap Straight End Solid Links. I am use to and prefer the nice smooth rubber strap.
4.0,"These sun readers are definitely oversized which is what I wanted. If you want some that are closer to the size of regular glasses, then don't order these. They are a bit lightweight so I don't know how they will hold up, but I like them so far. It was difficult to find sun readers in the 1.75 strength, and I was happy to find these. My only regret is that they didn't come with a case of some sort. When you spend that much on sun glasses, a protective case is essential to keep them in good condition and prohibit scratches."
4.0,"My son purchased this and was thrilled when it came.  He said it was bigger than he thought it would be.  We love the option to turn the music off. The only downfall is if you try to use real coins, they seem to be too heavy for the pushers and they stop working.  So we stick to the plastic coins that come with it. Hours of fun!!!"
4.0,effective
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable. Very roomy and flows. Enjoy wearing this dress
4.0,"I love this dress but it runs SMALL.  I got a large based on reviews (I'm 5'4&#34;, 135 lbs, 34A) and while it fits, it's much too short to fit as a dress.  I do love wearing it with leggings though.  The material is actually a bit thicker than I expected and its better quality in general than I was expecting."
4.0,Super cute but looser fit then I was expecting
4.0,Looks way smaller than a 2t. I recommend ordering a size or two up.
4.0,Very cute but super slow shipping
4.0,"Love the feel and the fit.  Usually a 12-14, but I‚Äôm<br />short so I got a medium and it fit great.  The material is very thin, and shows any undergarments but also curves!  Seems expensive for what it is, though."
4.0,Nice cute works fine
4.0,"The house dress is amazing: soft, comfortable, not so light, but good for summer and other warm areas. I ordered XXL and it was too loose for me. Had to return. The seller received the delivery back a few days ago, but Amazon has no information about it when I check my account. I wonder if I am getting my money back?!üòÄ"
4.0,this vest is nice looking and seems well made a tad small
4.0,"Pretty, but it tore on the 2nd use. However, Shari is wonderful, very kind, and was willing to send me a new one for free. üòä"
4.0,Love these! My only complaint is they can slide out easily due to the silky fabric.
4.0,great hiking sandal.
4.0,Money clip sucks but everything else is great
4.0,Very good gift for a small footed person
4.0,"The large bands DO NOT fit a 8.8 in wrist. I have 8.25 and 8.325 inch wrists, getting watch bands long enough is a pain. Got excited seeing the large bands available within a couple weeks of the Sense being released and ordered these. They are actually the same exact size as the original Fitbit band that comes with the watch.<br /><br />They appear to be well made, and I would expect them to fit exactly as the band I already have: almost snug on my left wrist and too snug on my right. They're going back and the search continues..."
4.0,Hat was exactly what we wanted
4.0,"I loved the quality of the shirt. Very deep color.<br />I gave it a 4, because it was missing a grommet on the collar. I didn't return it because I needed to wear the shirt the next day."
4.0,Great quality and a great price.
4.0,"Beautiful bag! My only issue is that it was hard to get the folds out because of how it was shipped, but I stuffed it and let it sit and it's fine! Totally looks designer"
4.0,Looks really good and my daughter loves it! Thank you!
4.0,This is so cute. I really like this bracelet. It catches the eye and is very comfortable to wear. Just make sure you keep the clear plastic brackets to hold loops in place.
4.0,Ll√©vele dress and very nice fabric.. it just runs. But big and once washed it kind off enlarged more.
4.0,"I liked that the order came with several nose rings because several arrived broken or broke while putting them on. However, the ones that were not broken worked great."
4.0,It's not bad but the fabric is thinner and needs an undershirt and it's not a long as in the photos.
4.0,Go up one size ...size large fits like. A regular size medium
4.0,Cute colors but had a horrible smell.  I immediately soaked them in baby detergent.
4.0,"I like the material (gray) of these pants, but they are a little bit thinner than the GYMSHARK leggings. They aren‚Äôt see through. I‚Äôm just confused on the sizing. I ordered a size large and they almost go up to my bra line. I‚Äôm afraid if I get a medium they will not fit. They do stay up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù7, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm short so idk why they come up so far!"
4.0,"The thicker insoles cause these shoes to be crammed in the toe .also tops of toes rub. I switched insoles with my new dvs deegan dirt insoles. Both were crammed in their  originals then both became quite comfortable with just the swap. got lemons, Made lemonade..what else can I say? :)"
4.0,Packed for a three night stay without need for extra bags.  Love it!  I wish it had more deep compartments inside.  The end storages are great.
4.0,The studs are wonderful but the jewel balls fall off easily & i always have to check to make sure the ball is on & is twisted on comepletely.
4.0,Good quality as advertised.
4.0,Awesome boots. I don't usually buy boots that go past my calf because they never seem to fit (I have large calves). These fit like a dream though. And are so comfortable.
4.0,"The earrings are a little heavy, but sturdily made. Unfortunately, the fasteners are poorly designed; very hard to open and even harder to close. Every pair of earrings I've owned with this type of fastener end up breaking or simply become too loose to stay closed. Otherwise, nice earrings."
4.0,"Very nice except the zipper got stuck the first time I wore it. We were able to get it unstuck without ripping or tearing anything. I wish it was a little longer, but overall I like the dress."
4.0,"My daughter just turned 3 yr. old last week, and I bought 4T, but it fit her too perfect. Its very cute, but I wished it was a lil bigger so it gives her room to grow into. Please see picture."
4.0,Great fit came fast. Little slippery for my taste cant really use your cellphone with them
4.0,The beanie can come in handy especially when going out on night walks or going outdoors. It also comes with build in speakers which have really decent quality sound which can be good for walks or even for just hanging out at home listening to music. It it's really comfortable and keeps your head warm during those cold winter days. The flash light has a decent light and lights up a good distance.
4.0,Cute dress but it was too big in the torso area and longer than expected.
4.0,They liked the gift.
4.0,smaller than expected but nice.
4.0,Great sock fill-ins for my Joules rain boots. Comfy and warm. Giving them a 4 because they do not stay put when taking them off. Wish they had a Velcro on the bottom or something? It's a design function NOT an actual reflection of the seller.
4.0,Muy bonita justo lo que buscaba solo un poco grande para mi mu√±eca da la vuelt el<br />Sobrante
4.0,"Yes, I do like them so far.  Alaska has a lot of darkness right now."
4.0,"Was torn on whether to keep this necklace or not. Nothing wrong with it but upon arrival, stone was much larger than it looks in product photos. It was closer to an inch large, when it looks more like 1/4-1/2‚Äù big in the photos. Wasn‚Äôt the look I was going so, as I wanted something much simpler and more subtle, so am returning. Will keep an eye out to see if the vendor ever has anything smaller in the future, as quality seemed otherwise very nice."
4.0,It is ok for the price.  Like the color.
4.0,"Nice quality and beautiful colors, a little short for a winter scarf. Very happy with my purchase and excited to give it as a Christmas present to my Opa (German grandfather)!"
4.0,It's a little tight around the breast area but other than that the product fits well.
4.0,happy but a little bit tides
4.0,I ordered these compression socks because I am on my feet all day long.  I originally ordered the argyle style but after wearing them for the 1st time I saw they left red marks on my leg. I contacted the company and they replaced them with a solid color. They work great for me and didn't leave marks like the argyle style.  I would definitely order from this company again.
4.0,"For the price, seems like overall good quality and deal"
4.0,Its too bad this product doesn't come bigger. lg was a tiny bit too small :(
4.0,Geat for night driving
4.0,Great .
4.0,bought these for my daughter and she loved them.
4.0,so far so good.  just hope it lasts a long time and not just a few months like others I've had.
4.0,definitely not compression tops but they're made of that athletic dry fit material
4.0,"Headline says it all. Also, I couldn't tell by the description whether they would look more silver, or gold. They are definitely very, very silver. But I do really think they're cool looking earrings! Also, in the pic I am wearing these in the bottom piercing, and a small silver ball earring in the upper piercing."
4.0,"This is a really soft sleep cap that I originally thought my husband might like but when it came I tried it on and think I will keep it for myself.  I am always cold but wouldn't want to sleep or hang out at home in any kind of restrictive or tight beanie cap that would make my head sweat or itch. This is the perfect combination because it is soft and breathable but also keeps your head warm. I was wearing it for about 2 hours and forgot it was on!  It was very comfortable! I think this cap would be perfect for anyone who is always cold, for an elderly person who has thinning hair, or even for a patient who is losing their hair.  This one is sized for men, but like I said it is loose and comfortable for sleeping.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I use reviews to make purchasing decisions and would never post one that didn't reflect my honest opinion. I will also update my review at anytime if the product fails or I have any problems with it. Thank you for reading my review!"
4.0,2 great belts in 1!  Finding a men's belt with a rose gold buckle is tough.  Like the buckle shape as well
4.0,I found the quality of these glasses to be fine.  The spring tension was enough to hold them in place (up and down) with no problem and they blocked the sun as intended.
4.0,"I love the cute cat & fish design of this shirt.  It is soft, but a little snug across the chest and around the abdomen.  I wish it was cut a little looser!  I might have to give this adorable shirt away.  Boo hoo."
4.0,Works great when I sweat less on cooler days. My Headsweats Beanie is preferable on hot days because it wicks away more sweat than my SweatVac.
4.0,"this earrings are absolutaley amazing! the only negative thing, and why im not giving 5 stars, its because they are a little bit heavy... but you will handle it. amazing earring, you will love, the price is great, qualitty is great too."
4.0,"Very comfortable to wear, fits perfectly."
4.0,"It's definitely a sturdy bag once you can get it unfolded.  It was really stiff right out of the package, so I warmed it up with my blow dryer to open it up.  It fits all of my travel toiletries and makeup which is nice.  I haven't taken it through airport security yet, but I'll update this review once I do that this summer."
4.0,I first ordered a size 7. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5.  My heel was sliding off the back but it fit good around the top of the foot.  I exchanged them for a size 8.  The length was good.  They were looser around the top of the foot.  When my feet get sweaty they tend to slide around.
4.0,"Other than this dress being a bit loose in the bust, I LOVE it!  I did order 1 size up based on reviews.  Also just a tad bit longer than I was expecting,  that said I am only 5'2&#34;  and it falls about 1&#34; below my knees."
4.0,"Glasses seem to be well built for less. Work well, fit well. Polarization seems to cut glare."
4.0,Dress is beautiful. Was bigger than I expected and smelled like dirt when it arrived but a quick and hem in back to fix that. Already ordered 2 more.
4.0,"i apparently ordered these in an 18, which doesnt seem to available anymore - but i am typically a 14/16 so based on feedback, i went up.  i am seriously considering a pair of the light blue so i can have a pair of blue bell bottoms but i would go with the 16.  these are a interesting fit - the don't do much complementary for the rear area - in fact i find they create a bit of a sag if you let them fall too long on your hips.  it's not a forced high waist, and there are no belt loops, so i do find myself pulling them up to avoid a saggy look.  they are long - i am near 5'8 and i can wear these with boots, tennis shoes, or heels.  anyone shorter than that is going to be forced to hem them or wear them with heels.  i'm kind of torn on these - i get compliments every time i wear them (i'm not the only one thrilled that bell bottoms are back) - but the no belt loops or front pockets does have me on the fence.  but they are so cute and easy to wear and i know my fit in them - and the price is appropriate so i will likely end up with another color."
4.0,"The pants are larger than I expected.  I am 5'3&#34;, 130lb.  Wish I had ordered a small."
4.0,I was fine
4.0,I wear a 14 to a 16 and am 5'3&#34;. I got the XL and it fit very well except it was a bit long.
4.0,"After washing and drying the nightshirt it comes down to just above my knees. I'm 5'6&#34; tall and not XL, but bought this size hoping for more length. It's fine and I'll wear it in the summer."
4.0,Great strap wish the color matched the face of the watch but that's just a small gripe.  Shipping was so fast.
4.0,This was a cute product and I was definitely satisfied with it as a small gift.
4.0,I have a 38&#34; waist and it's rough getting it on. The feel great once over my but and up to waist. Very snug. They won't fit 40&#34; waits guys.
4.0,Got it!
4.0,"Again, Patty B. makes cute designs  but the very clingy fabric is quite unforgiving if you have any tummy bulge at all.  I'm afraid we are returning."
4.0,"Love the style, but they were too long in the fingers for me.  I ordered a medium because other reviews said they were cut small."
4.0,bought a size smaller and it fit as expected really nice shirt bought it from Amazon.com
4.0,Very nice watch for the price
4.0,This purse was exactly what I expected. I loved the way it came all wrapped up etc... The colors are lovely and for what I am using it for it's perfect. Such as my Cell phone and other odds and ends in conjuction with my larger handbag. The smell of the leather is great as well. A bargin too for how nice it is. Great gift idea as well.
4.0,"I love the color, but even though it has a slit it's still a little see through."
4.0,"Item came as what is stated in the description and shown in photo. Only problem was that I didn‚Äôt get all 9 earring backings in the pack, only 6. Not a huge deal but would have liked to get all 9 backings - 1 for each individual earring instead of only having 6 and reusing them. Metal is true to what is shown - gold plated steel (not actual gold). Otherwise all of them sit comfortably on either ear and looks very cute and different for once!"
4.0,"top was a little loose, but the rest fit great!"
4.0,I gave 4 stars because of the slight refection of light. Otherwise I like it. I would recommend this to anyone.
4.0,Great looking and great quality..but not as big as I thought it would be..
4.0,On the website the flower petals look pink but they are actually purple but I still love it!
4.0,I love it a lot.. one thing i was upset about was that it was too big for my ear as a diath piercing... but it was super cute.
4.0,"This is super cute! Love the green color even though it looks bluish on the picture. Size L 5'2 and 1/2 in height, bust 36B/C, Hips 44, Waist 30 Great material and comfortable."
4.0,Looks great but rubs on my wrist funny
4.0,So excited to wear this to a wedding later this month. It's is a gorgeous gown &  great deal.
4.0,"Good coat, good price, just the right color for what I needed, but it is a bit smaller than I was expecting."
4.0,My wife loves it but the scent does not last entirely too long. It is still however a beautiful pendant she loves to wear often. It is bigger than we expected but not huge.
4.0,"Cute and simple. Cheaply made, but you honestly can't except much from a $7 dress. love it though!"
4.0,"I would give it 5* but it's slightly smaller than stated size but I liked it enough to keep it since it's not an everyday coat. This is a picture of the dark brown which i really like.  If you have lighter brown shoes, like khaki or tan, buy the coffee color (which is NOTHING like the product photo). I returned the coffee for a darker color. Even the dk brown photo has a tint of gray and isn't nearly as attractive as the actual jacket color in person. I don't wear a lot of brown but this works well as an additional coat to the wardrobe when I do wear darker brown shoes or boots."
4.0,"I love these shoes.  They fit true to size, maybe a little snug.  I love throwing them on over the summer instead of flip flops.  My only complaint and it has nothing to do with the shoe itself, but do not wear them over rocky surfaces as there is very little support between your foot and the ground.  But overall awesome shoes that you can wear anywhere."
4.0,"Band is well made, and the blue color is a perfect match for my watch. Only reason not 5 stars is the length of the band is a little small- just a little tough getting off and on- but totally comfortable to wear so it‚Äôs worth it."
4.0,On the torso the item is slightly loose. I ordered a small. Fits nice in all other areas. I made need to gain muscle but the item is good.
4.0,"I've had my eye on this dress for awhile now since it pops up on Pinterest all the time, but I didn't want to take the risk, not knowing how it fit. I figured an Amazon buy was relatively low-risk so I would try it out. It is FANTASTIC. The material is a good quality-- pebble texture and lightweight but not flimsy, and it has some stretch to it. The cut is also VERY flattering, and I would imagine it is on most body types. The slit is a little high on the side but not too high, and the length in the front and back hit me right below the knee. I'm 5'9&#34; and about 185 lbs (41 x 35 x 46 measurements), and I ordered the XL. It is a bit tight through the hips but the material is forgiving and it didn't look obscene. If your hips are much larger though, you might be out of luck."
4.0,I'm about 5'5&#34; and 155ish lbs. I ordered &#34;small&#34; leggings and capris at the same time from this company. The leggings fit perfectly but the capris were a tighter. Loved the color and material however four stars for inconsistent sizing.
4.0,Pretty floral print but it looked like a tent on me even though the fit was perfect
4.0,Love this dress and absolutely worth the money! Would love to buy this in another color!
4.0,I like it. It is very nice..
4.0,"Loved it, super cute. Had it about 6 months, then sadly I dropped it and it broke, so be careful with it."
4.0,"This product was so cute upon arrival, adorable but larger than expected. I should have bought a slightly smaller gummy bear. Very high shine gloss & smooth surfaces. Vibrant colors üòç."
4.0,I read the sellers notes through several times before purchasing this ring.  Over all I am pleased with it however it is smaller than I thought it was going to be. The stone is darker than the picture shows.  You can only see the 'rainbow colors' if you hold it at an angle under strong light otherwise it looks like a black stone. Its nicked and chipped after wearing it a couple of times; this is NOT an everyday ring.
4.0,Nice and sturdy! The color was different than I expected but nice quality!
4.0,Like material fits well
4.0,"Beautiful and unique, good value."
4.0,I ordered a size bigger as I know it's made of stretch material. I was surprised of the good quality for the price.
4.0,4 stars because they are a bit clunky and heavy. They are of very high quality. They arrived quickly.
4.0,Cute eyeglass case. To short or my glasses.
4.0,"For the price, these are so killer. I thought they would look stretched out when I put them on but they're surprisingly well made. The paint may not last forever but I'm happy with the purchase initially!"
4.0,The nose piece was good but the ear socks were not the right size for my Oakley‚Äôs.  But I kept the kit as the nose piece was what I needed....
4.0,"Love it because the color I chose mainly. So I just can't not love it. However, the sleeves are massive. I usually wear a size medium to large. I'm 5 ft tall and roughly 140 pounds (so a little more thicker than I'd like to be for my height) and I ordered a size small. The body fits loose which is what I wanted to hide the pudge/belly from over eating situations. Still love it. No big deal on sleeves but if you have tiny arms you will be swimming."
4.0,Great mother's day present
4.0,it looks a little lighter than the photo.
4.0,"Kinda hard to tell that they're water bears, but if you're giving it as a gift to someone who loves them already, they'll get it. They'll dig it."
4.0,The dress fitted perfectly.  Received a lot of compliments when I wore it for a evening at the movies.
4.0,"Dress was too large, ordered a small so returning the medium. Nothing wrong with the dress."
4.0,Too short I don‚Äôt like short  tops but is a nice top
4.0,Nice purse for the price.  More sections would make it better.
4.0,This is a simple light weight dress that fits similar to the carters brand sizes on my daughter.  It is great for hot days and is easy to gwt on and off.  The stitching is clean and the dress color is true to the picture.
4.0,This was a gift for someone I do hope they liked it.
4.0,the only thing I don't like about this mask is that the print is slightly off.  if it was centered I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,Fit pretty well.  Liked the price.  Little to no spandex to hold it any saggy body parts  :(  For me -- usually wear a 2X or a 20.  Bought a 7X
4.0,Looks great. Very slimming
4.0,nice  however one coin strand missing
4.0,"My parents were looking for face masks ""Made in USA"" and needed them to be light weight, fit the face correct and still easy to breathe through. These Live Free masks fit all they were looking for. Nicely packaged The ear straps are the right size, not to tight and not loose either. For my parents these are the right size and fit for their face, keep in mind yours may differ in fit."
4.0,Served the purpose for my 7 year old granddaughters costume.
4.0,Nice watch band but a little bit too large for a woman's wrist.  But I will keep it and have it trimmed.
4.0,"Love this dress! Used their sizing chart to find my size and it fits perfectly! This dress is heavier weight which will be great for wearing it through the fall & winter as I planned to do. The only negative I can say is that the sleeves are slightly scratchy. Nothing that makes the dress un-wearable or really uncomfortable for me, but may be a bigger issue for others. Overall a great dress that I would repurchase!"
4.0,would have kept it if I didn't find something better
4.0,The gloves are lovely and dress up every outfit.  They also protected my hands from the sun. The only negative is that the gloves snag easily.
4.0,"Review for style #6 Halter Asymmetrical Dress<br /><br />Would‚Äôve easily given this 5 stars because I do love the dress but I received my dress (see pictures) 1) Front neckline has a makeup stain on it. Clearly this was a return 2) Product selected said Black & White but this is Navy and White. No big deal since I was planning to style it with white accessories.<br /><br />The dress is really cute. Love the asymmetrical look. Fit as expected. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù , flat footed the long part of the hem is touching the floor. But I‚Äôll be wearing platform espadrilles so that‚Äôs not an issue. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it !!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I am 21 weeks pregnant when I wore this dress. So love the versatility !! Received a ton of compliments !"
4.0,Great style and look.... great quality and fabric for he price.. will be buying more from the company!!
4.0,Came on time. Everything fits perfectly. Item did not come with a headband.
4.0,Soft material - love it!
4.0,Am happy with this item..
4.0,These earrings are lovely. They are not the traditional round pearls; they are sort of flat round. I expect them to be very comfortable on my ear. The package had two types of backs for the earrings. I only wish they were a little larger. But they are very unique and beautiful.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. It's a little snug across the bust area, but not so much that it's problematic. I am looking forward to wearing it!"
4.0,Look great. Lenses clear no flaws. Well protected for shipping and nice semi soft case.
4.0,"Nice looking, but came with a defective lobster claw clasp and knots in the chain. I had to take it to a store to replace clasp.<br />Needs to ship with better wrapping and not in a &#34;jumble&#34;."
4.0,"In the picture it looks more like a garment bag - which is what I was hoping for. But, when I received it, it's actually more like a computer bag. It is very beautiful & very well made. It was just not what I was looking for."
4.0,Really nice grandson likes alot then I looked on the back and it says Budda instead of Bubba so heartbroken
4.0,"Love that all my credit cards fit in here. My change fits in the other zip area, but if I have very many bills, have to carry them in a bank envelope or leave them at home.. I do have to fold the few I carry up and they are in the little slot kind of tight. I suppose I could put the bills in with the change, again, they'd have to be folded. But that is the only drawback to this billfold. It is very small and compact, so I do have to be sure my purse is kept zipped up so it doesn't fall out, but I sure love it that it doesn't take up a lot of room in my purse."
4.0,Delivery was fast... great product.. works as it said so far... I‚Äôm 150 lbs 5‚Äô4... ordered a Medium my regular size.. for me it was a bit small but wearable. I‚Äôm sure as I get smaller it will fit better in a few weeks.
4.0,Very cute romper. Fit a little snug bit not too small. Perfect for a cute Easter Hunting outfit.
4.0,Is lighter than expected but still warm enough for fall
4.0,"Pretty well made (one end of the hanging loop had to be resewn 2 1/2 months after purchase) thick cotton towelling robe. Otherwise it seems to be holding up well, and My Dear Wife the pro ballet dancer looks very pretty wearing it."
4.0,Very cute but was too short.
4.0,"Very nice, more detailed then it appears in the photo! I like it!"
4.0,They are great bought 3 pair.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! I just wish I could get it over my butt! Lol! I would give 5 stars based off looks only but I'm giving 4 stars because the sizing is confusing with Meilum dresses. I usually order l larger and I've encountered every senario...too small, too large or perfect fit. Lol. So, confusing sizing."
4.0,"I was not expecting this thing to fit like it did when it came out of the box. It is very light and stretchy, which can be a good or bad thing. It definitely shows what's underneath it. But it's a beautiful fit and the slit sits at just the right place. The back is a little loose where the strings cross, so I may end up pinning it or something. The blue is gorgeous. All in all, I think it's a good value for the price."
4.0,"fits fine, looks fine, not much else to say"
4.0,The zipper was broken when I received the item.
4.0,"I personally wasn‚Äôt too fond of the material, it‚Äôs almost like a spandex/polyester. It doesn‚Äôt stretch too much though. If you want something a little looser and have bigger thighs/behind like me. Then I‚Äôd recommend going up a size. Overall, it was cute and comfortable."
4.0,"I've purchased these twice now because I misplaced a couple of the caps, but my second order had holes in one of the caps.<br /><br />Still, the reason I bought them twice was because I liked the fit and even when it becomes loose, washing and drying it tightens it again. They have kept my hair looking good."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but the material was a little thin."
4.0,Love this top but it dose run small.
4.0,"Looking at them I was skeptical, I am a curvy lady. But they went on with a few snapping thread sounds but completely covered my tush. I'm impressed, but I'm worried about how well they breath. They seem very thick and warm."
4.0,"Bought this suit as a butler costume for a murder mystery party. Material is definitely somewhat itchy costume grade, but is lined at least and the stitch work seems reasonably solid. Didn't expect much more as a 5 piece suit for this price. Size listed in description is pretty accurate, I wear a 40R and the jacket and vest fit well. Pants are adjustable, I'm 31x32 and there was plenty of room in the waistline but I wasn't at the smallest setting either, and pants have unfinished hems so you can hem them just right for yourself. Biggest complaint is that the pants hook closure is rusted and looks like it might not hold long, will bring safety pins to the party, just in case."
4.0,"Very comfortable, a little lose for me106lb , but still good for the price,"
4.0,Cute I just wish not everything was a crop top
4.0,The look is beautiful- fits perfect but it‚Äôs very light wait and not what I expected- it‚Äôs still very pretty- but was hoping it was heavier!
4.0,"This is a beautiful bag, unfortunately I had to return it because it was too small for what I needed. The opening at the top is smaller than I had expected. If you want a really, really small leather bag, you‚Äôll probably really like this."
4.0,Not real leather but its one of the best &#34;faux leather&#34; belts I have ever bought.  Looks great.  Feels comfortable.
4.0,This is a very cute dress! Bought it for a wedding shower and it looked great in photos. I just wish it would have been a little longer. I am 5‚Äù9 and bought a large.
4.0,Light weight hat. Comfortable!
4.0,Just what I needed to hold my glasses
4.0,Purchased as a gift for a friend.
4.0,"Was much larger than I thought it would be and the cord is very long.  very pretty though, especially against a plain top."
4.0,I'm a fairly well built guy and I found this to be a little tight in my chest and arms even going a size up. The tail really does look odd should be longer. But overall wad happy with this wish the pockets were bigger is all.
4.0,i love the leggings. They are soft and well made. The only thing I do not like is they are a little short waisted.
4.0,"I bought the dress for an all black outing for a bachelorette party but the material was too stretchy and thin and the over the shoulder piece was too long, it felt like a cape. It is my personal dislike, others may enjoy the cape-like feel or the thin and stretchy fabric... however it was not what I personally expected."
4.0,"This hat is so unbelievably cute! It came way earlier than expected, much to my surprise, and it is honestly pretty well-made for the price! Some stitching is a little loose inside the cap and around the sides, but it's nothing a sewing needle can't fix if necessary. The cap is made of 100% cotton, and is super cozy; the back of the hat has a little buckle you can use to resize the cap, and it has a wide range of fit. (I'm going to say that it can fit younger kids all the way to adult!) My only major complaint with this hat is that on the sides there's text embroidered that I was not aware of when purchasing. It's nothing bad, just aesthetically it's not my cup of tea. On one side it says, &#34;gimme,&#34; and on the opposite it says, &#34;faith.&#34; I ended up seam-ripping the text off, and am now very content with this adorable hat."
4.0,Bought as music teacher gift. Cute for the price. She loved it!
4.0,Soft and not too heavy.
4.0,Very lovely set.  Heavy and looks unique. Can't beat the price.  Will recommend.
4.0,Looks great but I got a XL thinking it would be ok but I should've gotten a large but that's ok I will just alter it
4.0,Fits and good material shipped fast would buy from seller again.
4.0,"Gorgeous material and well crafted, but the XL says it should fit a size 14 and it definitely fits better for a size 12.  Would have absolutely loved this dress if I could get it one size bigger.  I ordered the burnt orange color and the shade was beautiful!"
4.0,"Really nice jacket but runs REALLY small. I wear a Med to Large. I read where these run small so went ahead and ordered XL and it was just too snug for my liking.  Great jacket though! Lots of great pockets, good quality, versatile. Loved the color.  Just knew it would be uncomfortable at times."
4.0,Bought as a birthday gift for my son that lives out of state. Always had a problem with him forgetting his cooler or borrowing one of mine and not returning it to transport something from my house to his. This cooler SOLVED the problem. He collapses it and keeps it in his SUV and it's there when we need it. He lives 3 hours away and the food stays cool and fresh.
4.0,good  for  the  money
4.0,This cover-up is beautiful and unique. Lots of compliments on the beach. The missing star is due to the neck portion being too big even when tied tight. Gaps at the top
4.0,"Good fit. Nice, loose maxi dress that can be dressed up or down. Super comfy!"
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, that flutters every time you move. Slightly heavy i can feel them. Good for spring, and summer! Really flatters my face."
4.0,"I am 5' 3 1/2 and weigh about 135. I usually order a small, but read reviews so I  ordered the medium. These run small I think, and the waist is really too tight. I didn't return them because I washed them before I wear anything.  I ended up cutting the waist band so they would stretch a little. The color pink is very pretty. I have older brushed back pj's that I've worn out so wanted some new ones and was going to get all the colors. I can not buy any more of these because of the waist sizing. The material is thinner than my old ones too. Was disappointed with these."
4.0,Bought for a friend. She likes it very much. Looks good
4.0,NIce. Comfortable. Hot looking.
4.0,"Plenty of space to hold everything in my previous wallet. Love the look of it though it is a bit stiff, I imagine that wear and tear will eventually make it more pliable."
4.0,A few of the gold ones were bent.  Too much of a hassle to return/exchange.  They are very pretty!
4.0,"The fit is great, with a nice wide opening.  I LOVE the warm fur lining.  My only hesitancy in giving it 5 stars is that the pattern on the boot looks like it will rub off fairly easily (so far so good though)."
4.0,It's a great top but size up! I wear a medium normally and I got the XL and it still didn't cover well! So make sure to just size up.
4.0,Cute! Perfect for a beach party.
4.0,These pants are nicely tailored in a stretch woven fabric. Sizing seems a bit off though - these run small so order accordingly. Otherwise a flateering fit and style.
4.0,"Love this set! I wear them when I'm at home, and I've even worn them out to go shopping! They fit perfectly, and the waist band is elastic so it won't ride down my hips"
4.0,Bracelet is very classy-looking.  Replaced the rubber-type band on a white and stainless Relic (Fossil) watch.  Had a little trouble connecting the pins but got lucky and connected.  Would recommend.
4.0,"I thought it would be slightly smaller, but I am still very happy with it"
4.0,Very comfortable and very well made. Only down for me is I am a big AND tall so it often means it will fit above the ankle .
4.0,"With everything going on in the world today, I remember how Copper has antimicrobial benefits. So I wanted to my EDC gear coppered out as much as I can. When I received this product, it came nicely packed. When I opened up the box, it was simply gorgeous. The brushed look that it already comes with is done well. I like the changeable face plates so you can always feel like you have a new wallet. I have 3 (hard/slim style wallets including this one) and wish I found this product first. Probably would saved on wallets to match my EDC gear."
4.0,"So pretty, not for short fingers. Also not for wearing with easily snagged clothes. Super pretty and sparkly, does look old."
4.0,"I purchased this in a large but when I received it, it was definitely big.  My concern was the chest area.  So I ordered it in a medium and it fit perfectly.  It is still super long even with heels on and I am 5'8"", so I have to take it to get it altered in the length. But for the price I paid, its worth paying the additional price to shorten it."
4.0,"I gave a 4 star because the black color on the fabric comes off easily.  My hands and fingers get dyed after immediately after putting on the pants.  The size is perfect, style looks unique, nice linen cotton fabric, and they fit very comfortably.  Other than the dye problem, I really like these pants."
4.0,The band works well and looks nice. My only complaint is that it snags on materials. It has snagged my pillow case and a dress.
4.0,Im in love with my items i wasn't expecting the material to be nice but thank you seller and Amazon.
4.0,Apron wasn't real sturdy and there aren't any pockets but the pig with wings was too cute.  Daughter was pleased.
4.0,comfortable to wear throughout the day
4.0,"They are super cute and the colors are vibrant like they look online<br />My biggest problem was ordering these Wednesday and instead of receiving them on Saturday (one day shipping) got them on Tuesday the following week and getting these sad and frustrated looks from my six year old,  which got worse every day they didn't arrive"
4.0,"Terrific quality. However, Larger bras do not quite fit. 34DD for example didn't quite fit"
4.0,"it's a bit pricey, but i liked it enough to buy it. Alice in Wonderland items are not easy to find."
4.0,"A lovely daytime dress, but I am returning it because I wanted something for dancing. It would be too hot and not swishy and flowing."
4.0,The shirt is shorter than it looks in the picture and a little more boxy not as flattering as it looks but still great quality still very cute
4.0,It is more kid size
4.0,"These enable me to wear earrings that caused itching, swelling and redness in the past.<br /><br />You have to &#34;gauge&#34; out your earring holes. My suggestion is take a breath and push it through quickly. Then care for your ears as if they were newly pierced both disinfecting and turning the earrings and posts until they are no longer tender.<br /><br />I would have liked more earring backs, I lost two in the first week. But I have a short hair style which I constantly tuck behind my ears... I have cut a slit in the clear earring backs you use on dangly earrings and these have done well as they fit snugly over the post and sheaths without taring the sheath.<br /><br />I will be purchasing more."
4.0,Love it but barely fit. Do not reccomned for plus size women
4.0,"I got this umbrella out of the box and had it put up and into the table/weight in less than five minutes by myself.  It has a velcro strap to keep the umbrella down when not in use that seems to stay in place pretty well.  I like the dark red color.  My only complaint is that the auto-tilt part of the pole is really high up-- I wish it tilted a little lower on the pole, so that we could get more shade at certain points in the day."
4.0,The onesie was on the small size. The adult fit as expected.
4.0,The dress Hugs you! I got a medium and it fits tightly The large would have been better for me
4.0,Soft & comfortable without being frumpy!
4.0,A great gift. Beautiful color. Only it did not come with the oil felt balls.
4.0,Great for their intended purchase... I would order a size bigger! I ordered 2 pair at the beginning of the summer and still holding up! No holes or tears. Super cute styles.
4.0,Superrrrrr cute! They look expensive and the stems aren‚Äôt flimsy which is a plus for the price!
4.0,Fits as expected and quality as expected
4.0,"Cute, simple, and $2.99. A little trendy piece of costume jewelry. Came very tangled but straightened out nicely. Great for summer."
4.0,Not cheap material. Last great and it‚Äôs been a few months. I wear it everyday
4.0,"This bra looks good and feels nice, but it doesn't provide a lot of support if you're going to be jumping around for your workout. If you're planning to only do low impact activities then this is wonderful! I'm a 32D and I ordered a Medium, I don't think I could fit into a smaller size comfortably, the medium is a good fit"
4.0,"I already have one dress by make me chic and love it. Loose and great material. The side seams on this one were a little off, but I decided to keep it anyway."
4.0,"This is a beautiful poncho. I tried it before wash it, and it was perfect. I didn't have the chance to wear it not even once because I washed and it was a disaster. The garment shrinked to a toddler size."
4.0,i wish it was cottone.
4.0,"I love my shirt.It is so soft and cute. It took awhile to get to me, but it was worth it."
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 135lbs and this dress fits great. The design is amazing and the material used is comfortable and does not look cheap. I would definitely recommend this dress."
4.0,Love the design and the fabric but the XL size was way too tight for me and my wife thought it was nice but too small even for her!
4.0,"In this case, they fit nicely and didn't bind; not enough compression for a double mastectomy patient. Otherwise, comfortable and easy dressing."
4.0,I got it for my bf for his birthday was disappointed with the quality but he love it because it‚Äôs his fav team
4.0,Top seems pretty true to size but looks a bit cheaply made.<br />Bottoms look pretty long - a little to long but nice quality<br />Hat loooks a bit on he bigger side but nice quality
4.0,Great for the price and very comfortable. It is a little flimsy though. One strap broke after a week but it was fixed easily.
4.0,"My boyfriend loves how comfy they are. He is a size 12 and we got the large (size 11-12). If you are a 12 you will need to break them in as they will be a bit tight at first. Great product for the price,  especially."
4.0,Super cute but had to return and go up a size in a different pattern.
4.0,Good materials comfortable
4.0,"Band is nice, design is perfect, material is excellent and it fits well."
4.0,"My LG G5 and a few credit cards and ID fit.  If i try to put a chap stick in too, it fits but is difficult to close.  Love the color!"
4.0,"cute - good quality - but too tight as other reviewers have said. i would say my wrists are average - i've never had trouble with standard store bracelets or bangles, but this doesn't fit me well."
4.0,"Like the look but these are definitely not compression. I bought small, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 132 and 36 c And this fits snug."
4.0,"These are just as described, and the quality is reasonable considering the low price."
4.0,Really covers all bases
4.0,Sweater is cute wish it was waist length
4.0,"Overall this sweater is pretty nice. It looks a little thin when I hold it up with my hand in it, but it doesn't appear quite that thin when I wear it. It's a pretty color and a nice design.<br /><br />I am 5'6 and weigh about 150. I ordered a Medium. It's not quite as long as it is on the model, and it's a *touch* wide around the middle. So I wish it was a little slimmer and longer, but it's not bad.<br /><br />I think it will be a pretty good shirt if hand-washed. I'll update my review if needed, but for now I'm pleasantly surprised."
4.0,"Very cute, soft material and fits pretty well, maybe runs a little small.<br />I'd purchase it again!"
4.0,"Always top quality as regards Patagonia.  But a large is too loose and allows cold air in, the medium is a bit snug.  No air will infiltrate for sure."
4.0,Good quality. As described. would recommend.
4.0,"Me qued√≥ muy bien, me gust√≥. aunque la tela no era lo q esperaba. Pero esta bien"
4.0,"This is pretty, but doesn't come with a full kit."
4.0,"Super soft, nice wide elastic(which sometimes rolls), love the feel of these pants. Shipping took awhile but it was worth it."
4.0,The ring size Is small per regular sizes so is too small.
4.0,"I loved how the dress looked, however if you have more of an hourglass figure it makes the dress a little bit more revealing in the crotch area, so if you do have an hour glass figure I recommend sizing up. The length stayed the same when I bought a size up it just didn‚Äôt make me paranoid if I take too big of a step that‚Äî- everything will be exposed if you catch what I‚Äôm throwing. The chest area fit perfectly."
4.0,La blusa es muy peque√±a
4.0,"Loved the comfort & quality. First wash bleeds color. Perfect for a set of family pictures, comes in girls sizes too."
4.0,"My son likes it. He says it completes his Dr. Who costume. We did have to put a cardboard to keep the shape. It is lightweight. Overall, nice Fez."
4.0,Great product at a great price. Feels so comfy using this gloves and doesn‚Äôt give any kind of irritation while wearing it.
4.0,"I am usually a size small, but this size small would not fit past my thighs. I had to size up to a medium, which fit great. I got the dark green leopard print and they were very squat-proof/not see-through. For reference I'm 5'2"" 115 lbs, size 2 pants."
4.0,"Great wallet, though do not use for change as it falls out."
4.0,Im usually a medium but after reading the other reviews stating that they run small I ordered a large. It fits good and is made of good quality not cheap. The colors are as they look in the pic. I love it
4.0,My son loves the shirt ! It's perfect for a Who fan
4.0,"These are great, but don‚Äôt last very long."
4.0,"They do the job, but they aren't nearly as comfortable as I had hoped."
4.0,"Brought to wear under my suits.<br />I love it, but after 5 or 7 delicate washes (in a wash bag), it still looks worn out and not as fresh and new anymore. Thinking about buying more."
4.0,"Excellent purchase as far as price (bought on sale).  I chose the color based on the picture rather than the description of &#34;Gold&#34;. Turns out they aren't med. brown or gold but instead dark beige which I can live with. But that's why I gave only 4 stars. Fit is great.  I wondered if I should account for winter socks and go up a size, but gratefully Mountrek manufactured them correctly so the 8.5 fits true to size with the room needed to wear socks.  Hooorah! They are very comfortable.  Now all it has to do is snow for the final test."
4.0,"Durable, well made, cute.  Fabric is a little rough."
4.0,"Great felling of fabric , the cut it's ok."
4.0,"This is a beautiful top! The design is lovely, and the fabric is lightweight and &#34;flowy&#34;. My only concern is that it's more of a crop style shirt. It has a fitted band at the bottom, so if you have a short torso, it may not feel like a crop top on you. I'm tall (5'11&#34;) with a long torso, so this hits just at the top of my pants and does show skin when I move around. I just wear a cami underneath to keep covered, or I wear it over a tech tank if I&#34;m going to a yoga class.<br /><br />(I still love this so much, I ordered another one with a different design!)"
4.0,"As expected, although as you can see in attached picture, there's some glue on one of the tassels. I'll have to try and color it in myself to fix it. They're pretty comfy, fairly thin - so I'm really hoping that they will last and not give out like the other reviews. The backs are a bit rough so I'll have to add some padding as well. Otherwise, super cute and excited to have purchased (have yet to wear out)"
4.0,Dress was a bit too short for me. Above knee.  A bit snug.
4.0,"Not as long in the torso as I'd like, but otherwise fit as expected."
4.0,"Great length, fits slightly tight in the arms."
4.0,These are very hot. I would not recommend them for the summer time. Also a bit snug so I would order a size up or two. They are soft but don't have much stretch to them. I am 155lb and bought XL and I wish they came in an xxl but so far they don't. For the price they should be more comfortable. Don't think I will buy them again.
4.0,I really love this good it‚Äôs good really well I got a medium and it‚Äôs a little bit tight at that‚Äôs the The Waze so if you‚Äôre usually a medium get a large
4.0,"Overall, I love this wristband! It is much sturdier than my previous ones, and I've gotten multiple compliments on it.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it was super difficult to adjust it to my wrist size. It took my mom's boyfriend almost an hour to do it, and he's a pretty handy guy! But, I still think that it's worth the hard work.<br /><br />As long as you're willing to work on it a bit at first, this watchband is one of the best!"
4.0,Went great with the lego set
4.0,"These work really well for my foot. I have really high arches. The support is comfortable without being either too soft or hard. The padding is comfortable under my heel and ball of my foot. The heel seat is good. Your foot won't float around in them. They are much smarter than most of the other brands, ( I have tried them all) On the bottom side of the insert, they have trim lines that are easy to follow if the insert doesn't exactly fit you shoe. When you consider that these are about half the price of other brands for equal or better value you'll know they are a good value."
4.0,Fits true to size. Seems like a well built boot. Due the waterproof membrane they are a bit hot but this is no problem for me as I bought them for winter time and to keep beside my bed. Due the the zippers these are awesome to keep at the ready beside your bed as they are super quick to slip on in the case of an emergency.
4.0,I'm 5.6 and 115 lb. I got the size M for a little bit more room and comfort. I wanted to be able to wear a thicker long sleeve shirt with my hoodie. I'm very happy so far. Fabric is nice and thick for those chilly mornings. I wear scrubs for work with long sleeve shirts underneath and this hoodie is just the thing for cooler mornings. I work out a lot and will also be wearing it to the gym. Happy so far.
4.0,Good pair glasses fits good. Plastic frames that are comfortable on face. Seems like will hold up well
4.0,"A darn good keychain. It‚Äôs bright and colorful and a fun insignia. Not a lot of weight to it though, the back is hollowed out, so it feels flimsy, same with the hook it comes on. To each their own, but I prefer something with a bit of heft to it, so I filled the back of mine with epoxy and nails. All good now fam üòé‚úäüèΩ"
4.0,Great quality and graphic...runs small
4.0,Good timing and size is as I have expected :)
4.0,"Nice looking suit, but top was too big."
4.0,Got this for my little baby nephew and it's adorable.<br />Very soft too
4.0,"Fit as expected, serves the purpose"
4.0,Worked great! Shed everywhere.
4.0,It's for my granddaughter's Birthday Aug.20 so I'm not sure how it fits. The top seems large.
4.0,"Overall seems like a nice dress.  The material the skirt is made out of us just stiffer than I expected. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not quite what I thought it would be."
4.0,My new favorite pair.
4.0,"It‚Äôs exactly as pictured. Fits perfectly. There is however, some kind of white residue in the fur. It flakes off mostly, but it was kind of weird. Needed it for a trip the next day so had to keep it instead of returning for a new one."
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt use yet, but looks like it will work."
4.0,"Fits as expected. Comfortable. Has removable pads, which is great cause I hate pads."
4.0,"This is a thick knit scarf, very warm and soft for outerwear or for layering indoors. You can take this one out of the package and go. The white color goes with everything and the width is great for extra coverage. You'll want to get a few of these-- one for yourself and a few to hand out as gifts."
4.0,Size of top runs very small and arms are long according to the person I bought this for. She is slim build.  It was for a 7 yr old girl and was adorable and well made but just sizing was off. Order up a size for sure and have the skirt taken in if needed.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings, they look expensive and are shiny. I gave it four stars because they are not for everyday use. I had ones in silver which I used every day with no problem, but these after some time become green, and when it happens it also becomes uncomfortable."
4.0,Very comfortable and nice for summer days!!
4.0,Bought for my son for Christmas he likes it but it shrunk a little bit
4.0,Happy with the fit and the quality. My only complaint is that they have more compression in my upper calf than in my lower calf. They are a bit slippery but fine in basketball shoes laced tight.
4.0,"I love everything about this dress!! The material , style ,length etc. Very lovely dress!!!"
4.0,Narrow hips 4 size 38
4.0,Super comfortable and flattering. I didn't read the description carefully before I bought the underwear. I was surprised to find that there's no cotton liner.
4.0,"This sweater is very elegant with a partial tailored look. It's very pretty, but I think this is Asian sizing. I'm not a large person-5 foot 120 lbs- and I found the medium just fit with little wiggle room. The sleeves were kind of tight around the forearm and wrist area. If I'm wearing more layers, this sweater would not fit comfortably. I like the way the sweater hangs and the nice button detail on the sleeves, but I wish it was a bit bigger."
4.0,"These are great. I need to get more in other colors. They are just slightly too big for me, but I wear them anyway. Very comfortable!"
4.0,I love it and it was very nice i get so many compliments.
4.0,I have pretty big boobies 38 DD and ya know mom boobs ü§£  so I didn't have high hope for these things but they arnt bad. It helped them stay upish.... but more cover my nips and keep em in place I'd love to try the bigger size and see how they fit but these will do. And pretty sticky too easy to wash and love that they come in light and black.
4.0,"These are super comfortable and fit exactly as expected. I sized up intentionally and they were just a bit loose. They do have some rubber on the inside at the bottom of the leg to help avoid having them ride up. The padding is right where you need it to be to make biking more comfortable, which as I get older I finally understand. The design is super cute (I went with the men's version because I'd prefer grey over pink for the side accents). My only issue with them is that they are super sheer. I tried them on over my underwear (even though my dad says if you wear bike shorts you aren't supposed to wear undies) and through the shorts there was no trouble identifying the muted pattern on my undies (they're nude colored with white stripes, but I don't need you to know that by sight). I like the shorts enough though that I'll wear them but with another pair of shorts on over the top for modesty."
4.0,"I'm not a teenager any longer, so it's nice to have an option for a longer cut. True to size. My only issue is that they are a bit too thick if you want to roll the cuff up a bit."
4.0,"I knew I was taking a risk when I ordered this, as the size chart only went to 5'8 and I am 5'9. But I was well with the weight range (145), so I thought I would give it a chance.<br />And yes, they are a little short on me. The gusset does not sit flush against my body. Were I thinner around the hips and thighs, I think I might have gotten it to fit, but at my weight and height it was just a tad too small. However, these are convertible, and if I wear them footless, they fit perfectly.<br />That said, the stretch was incredible. I had doubts when I opened the package and the unstretched waistband was about 4inches across. It took some careful wiggling, and there were some moments I felt it catch around a nail or a callus that I was worried it would run, but I got it on nicely. Though I'm still concerned that the material feels like they will run easily."
4.0,"I've only had these slippers for a week, but I have worn them daily and they appear to be well-made and are sturdy and comfortable.  I like the cotton shoestrings. They stay tied; not like buckskin shoestrings I've had on other moccasin slippers."
4.0,Es como se esperaba. Muy bonito
4.0,They get wet really easily but they look and feel nice
4.0,The color set  was exactly as shown it was a cute set but the bottom piece was too small for my sisters hips. Eventually i will be reordering the set again
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  However, I ordered it in rose gold and received yellow gold instead.  This piece is an elegant addition to my bracelet collection."
4.0,The jacket fits nice and is definitely worth the price.
4.0,"Exactly what I needed, thanx"
4.0,Theu are a bit too tight
4.0,"It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Why I gave three stars, as a previous reviewer stated, be careful when adding the ball as the stem does bend. I was able to right it, but if it bends again, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to break! For the money though, it did serve it‚Äôs purpose."
4.0,I had to give these away because they were too small for me<br />If they fit they seem to be good quality
4.0,Very cute and a perfect sizeüëå<br />But it doesn‚Äôt feel like 14k gold
4.0,"The purse was cute, but way too big to carry around for every day use.  The gold in the middle of the bow looked a bit cheap.  It just didn't work for me, but would be a great size for someone who carries a lot of stuff in their purse, or to use on a weekend trip."
4.0,Not as easy to read the writing as I thought it would be.
4.0,"It's cute, but there's NO traction. You will slip."
4.0,Really sheer but perfect for summer and super cute!
4.0,"Fit is ok, your basic long john"
4.0,"Works fine. Tiny watch. Hasn't leaked after months of daily showers, but I never press the buttons if it's wet.<br /><br />Update: After a year and a half, still working. A little bit of swimming (ten times) and I wear it in the shower every day, never leaks. Use timer every day repeatedly working out at gym. Strap shows no wear. Everything still works. Great value."
4.0,We had problems with keeping the shoes on. They slipped and didn't keep their shape.  Hat was too small but rest of costume was attractive and very authenic.
4.0,"Love the color,pretty blue color!!!"
4.0,It fit perfectly and all my friends love it!
4.0,"I measured my finger at 60mm, ordered a 9 & it's too big. I am returning for an 8. The rings are nice colors, but also a little too wide for my liking."
4.0,It‚Äôs not nearly as long as shown and the pockets line up directly under your bra cups.  I don‚Äôt see it really fitting a over a size large.  I‚Äôm a solid medium and it fits about right. But it‚Äôs cute and worth the ten bucks.
4.0,I ordered a large which is what I usually wear. I'm 5'3 154 lbs. 36dd. The waist struck the top of my hips. I gave this a good review because this dress is beautiful and well made. It just wasn't the dress for me. Not the fault of the dressmaker that I'm too short for it.
4.0,"I only needed a couple of units in the small size. So far, no problem with the quality of this product."
4.0,"Very good product, fits well and is warm!!"
4.0,Came a lot faster than was listed. Get a lot of compliments on it. Durable and warm. Great purchase for the price.
4.0,I had purchased this to put inside a satchel. One that had no pockets or interior zippers. I have found this to be extremely helpful. I'm a person that likes things in order and having everything in a specific place is great. This has space for everything with a very large Center that holds a small makeup bag as well as my wallet. The smaller Side Pockets are great for little things and as I found the two zippers on the sides we're useful for those papers that you don't take out but end up in your bag with nowhere to go ; now they're concealed where nothing can happen to them. This is a great organizer it opens up flat on the bottom and allows me to transfer to another purse anytime with the use of the handle's on each side.  It actually has more pockets than I had even thought about needing. Giving me room to carry even more stuff. And when not in use it folds snapping closed allowing you to slide it in a small space.
4.0,I really like this shirt.. Its smaller than a US large but it fits me perfect. I am 5'7 and 115. Its light weight and looks exactly like the picture. Its great for work and with leggings because it covers your back end.
4.0,The hoodie fits my daughter really well except the hood is too small. It won‚Äôt even fit on her head. She is 2 and it says 3t but will not fit her head.
4.0,olor raro
4.0,"Perfect for going into fall this tank looks great underneath jackets/ sweaters! Such a great price point with a good amount of color options, I would size up if you are between sizes or looking for a less form fitted look. The fabric is super comfy and soft!"
4.0,pretty and my friend like it
4.0,Colors are great! Material reminds me of a jersey.
4.0,The suite itself is really cute and wish would have fit as was just what I had in mind but had to return
4.0,Love this purse has lots of room and great to carry lots of things.
4.0,Perfect for the Richie Tannebaum look.
4.0,"I so wanted this dress. I ordered it, and it didn't work for me, but my daughter rocked it well!! Thank you Miusol for great and affordable gowns. I look forward to more orders in the future."
4.0,"nice shirt but ran small, too tight on me so I gave it to my daughter."
4.0,"red a bit too bright, but loved the vest.  Wore it all through Europe.  Enough style, but lots of pockets.  No purse needed."
4.0,Overall quality was good but I thought it was too long. Almost to my knees and I'm 5'6&#34;.  The fabric and feel of it is nice.
4.0,Said true to size but that's not correct. I advise you to purchase 1 size bigger. Clearly if your going to be wearing this coat you not going to be wearing a thin shirt under it. So 1 size up would be perfect. It's soft and beautiful.  I purchased one for myself and one for my sons girlfriend because she liked it so much . Nice buy
4.0,The color did not match the picture. The picture shows a darker red than it actually is. So I was a little disappointed. Besides of that it is a nice bag.
4.0,A little bigger then I thought but very nice.
4.0,"Got this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it! Cute, small (easy to travel with), and works well! The only down side was it took forever to set the alarm, now were not sure how to turn it off. My husband and I both messed with it for a day to try and figure it out."
4.0,"Ordered according to the size chart, but they are still tight.  They are no-show socks, so sit a little too low also.  Not as thick as other bamboo socks.  Would not buy again."
4.0,"This very so cute and I‚Äôm really glad I got it for my lanyard, I got the one with the pink backpack, the face details were okay and it was overall a good product. She‚Äôs now accompanying my other keychain creaturesüòä"
4.0,"Beautiful ring for the price. Only thing, is that the edges of the end symbols lifts up and catches on &#34;everything &#34; üòî. Not to mention if your not careful it may cut you making one bleed."
4.0,"Cute, comfortable shoes"
4.0,but this is thinner than I expected I'll have to lose weight or move the button
4.0,Hoodie is super cute with the pearls. Wish it fit. Runs small. Will be returning.
4.0,"This Amiery tank top is really cute.  When I first opened it up I did not think I would like the fabric, it is a very thin knit.  But once I tried it on I was very pleased with the feel of the fabric against my skin and it lays very well.  The vintage Aztec type print is nice and colorful.  It is a racer back which is really cute.  It is however, very low cut and I am going to have to wear a cami underneath.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review."
4.0,"These fit perfectly on my boyfriend who has wide shoulders. They were true to size. The blue on the shirt is a bit darker in person than in the photo, but it was fine for what he was using the shirt for (as a costume)."
4.0,"Supplied tools are small and strip out easy. I used my own Torx 5. Band is great. I liked the original band but, I was having a skin reaction to it. This band is strong and the fasteners are nice quality. Overall I love it."
4.0,"Fit a just a tad bigger than expected, but I'm cool with that.  Water beads right off as well...we'll see how they hold up."
4.0,Good quality leotard.  Washed up nicely.
4.0,Seems of good quality but seems to run a tad bit small.
4.0,Got this for my daughter. I think the construction is good and the material is of good quality.
4.0,"Okay, we LOVE this sweater. We have it in 6mon and our little man was growing out of it, so we got it in 12mon. It‚Äôs almost the exact same size.... I returned it and was able to find an 18mon at a OshKosh store üôåüèº"
4.0,"Little trinket for my wife, who always likes bracelets and such.  Thought it was cute.  Can't fingure out how they make and ship so inexpensively. It was packaged very well."
4.0,Carefully washed this top to take the smell out.  Fits well.
4.0,"Fit well, not as cushioned as I had hoped"
4.0,Okay but damages easy from tongue of sneakers
4.0,"Good shirt, but a little big"
4.0,"I just received the luggage 1 day ago.  I inspected thoroughly and found all 3 pieces to be in good working order.  I like the shell material.  Handles, locks, zipper, and wheels all function properly.  The roll is smooth.  I would have to update the comments after a trip where the luggage is handled by the airline, but I'm sure it will hold up.  At this point, I recommend it."
4.0,Velcro isn‚Äôt quite durable but fit and color are great.
4.0,"Cute but fits a little small. Does great with being washed, no fading."
4.0,"This dress fit me perfectly, not too long. Washes well."
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; 135lbs. I ordered a Large. The bottoms fit pretty well, but are a little tight in the legs. The top is too big (I'm a 34B). I ordered a Medium as well, but they were shipped at different times."
4.0,Not the same quality as the other colors.  Fabric totally different
4.0,Nice bags. Wish they were bigger. The can hold a large grocery order but i still question 50lbs. Still very pretty bags.
4.0,Good looking hoodie. Very narrow and long sleeves and leanght. Size medium does like a small with large arms and leanght.
4.0,"Small and compact.  easy to toss into purse.  I squeezed in 6 credit cards, but then it was hard to get them out.  Better with 3 or 4.  Has a nice hole in the clear plastic side to let your finger slide up your license or id.  not much space in the zipper compartment - it zips only on one side and has no expansion capability.  Holds a few bills."
4.0,My pre teen loves it.
4.0,My father likes it and the blue color is great fr summer.
4.0,"It may just be because it's thin, but it doesn't feel like real metal. But not like plastic either. I would recommend watch out for water. Came in a different box than shown but very well painted and for $3 not a bad buy."
4.0,Very long. Exactly as it said it was.
4.0,"I liked this. Ok clasp and would fit better if it was bigger. I use this for my daith.  However, I'm trying a ton and i dont want to change my Dath 20 times To review products; so Thats why I used the fake ear. It looks exactlylike my ear / piercings."
4.0,Ugly baggy pockets
4.0,"Tight fit for 9.5W shoes, but probably not much bigger items"
4.0,Noyhing major but ensure order true size
4.0,"Nice suit but just a little too small for my teenage son.  It was well made but just a tad to small for my son.  I ordered him a 36 and the pants a re little too tight, so unfortunately I am going to have to return it."
4.0,It's a little short through the torso but the suit overall is nice.  Waited a long time to get it which was disappointing.
4.0,Nice bands.
4.0,I bought these tanks to wear during my radiation for breasr cancer. Bras not recommended because they could rub the tender skin during treatment. The compression tanks were a good solution and helped with possible lymphedema concerns. I was hoping they'd fit a little tighter.
4.0,Nice. Fits well.
4.0,I kind of excepted that they would be a little small but they are great otherwise.
4.0,Very nice case for pendant and small earrings. The light really makes the jewels sparkle. Hinge is solid and so is the case. Nice feel to the finish.
4.0,Comfortable and pretty shoes. Not heavy despite being platform shoes. I agree with another reviewer that the blue color isn't as pictured but is still lovely. It's more of a pale ice blue color and no where as intense as shown online.
4.0,It‚Äôs a very cute dress. I was able to wear though my whole pregnancy. It‚Äôs super soft and light. Only downsize is the pink is completely see though and will need something under it to wear out in public.
4.0,Very comfy and flattering . Fit was true to size. I would say more stretch than not . The material is soft and has good tummy control . Overall a good buy !
4.0,"Purchased for my 1st grader who requested a bow tie. He loves it, I bought the 4-8 y.o. size would recommend sizing up if your child is toward the higher end of the age range but it is still super cute and comfortable. Very well made. So nice to find fun patterns, hope to see more in the future."
4.0,I liked the color and comfort but a little on the cheap side
4.0,Good looking. Would have given five stars but gave four because the  Female mask was a bit sticky on side that touches face.
4.0,"Let me start off with this: my husband LOVES these shorts. I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The sizing on these seems to run a little smaller than I expected. I would have gotten the next size up if I had known, but let's pretend that I was being optimistic and proactive and assumed that I'd be losing weight/inches and these will fit better in (hopefully) a short while. Aside from this, these are actually pretty comfortable. I did a high impact workout that had my pulse up to 155bpm and these were the last thing on my mind. There wasn't much in the way of adjusting that needed to be done, even after finishing my workout, helping make dinner, and changing two diapers while sitting on the floor."
4.0,I ordered a large based on the size chart and reviews but it was too big on top.  I had to return. I will probably order a medium.  The print of black floral is very cute and would look cute with a jean jacket or jean vest.
4.0,"I purchased this dress in &#34;orange red&#34; for a summer wedding. I was overall impressed with the quality for the price. The color is a perfect, bright coral red--just what I was looking for! I am 5'4&#34;, 120lbs, 34C and the medium fit perfectly. so could see having to size up with a larger chest though. The dress is very comfortable. I would have given 5 stars, but it seems the waist seam was a bit crooked. This is easily hidden by the waist tie, but would be noticeable if I decided to go without the tie. It was also a little difficult to get rid of wrinkles due to packaging, but a warm iron, no stream, did an ok job. I would definitely buy this dress again in another color."
4.0,"Not bad, though I did not like the buttons down the front."
4.0,"I love these and have gotten many compliments on them! Although, my only complaint is that there are areas where the threading is coming undone. I wonder if it is just a flaw/ defect in my particular pair (on the side thigh and rear)...? Overall, really like these and buy a lot from the RBX brand. They are a favorite of mine."
4.0,The fit is great and it‚Äôs super soft. The sleeves are a little much but it‚Äôs still super cute. Would buy in another color!
4.0,"Only 4 stars simply due the fact that I don't think they are real leather. They look kind of faux leather. I even tried to distress them like I do with other leather products, and these did not respond like leather would. I still have received compliments though and the price is so cheap who cares."
4.0,Get pasties if you care about nip slips. Maybe go a size up if you wan‚Äôt extra fabric? I felt like I needed a bra for it to look good so not in this pic but after I added one.
4.0,"super cute hat for baby boys and neutral colors for even little girls, esp the white one!<br /><br />doesn't fit 6M heads, but more like 1 year olds but they can grow into it!  the material is so soft and not itchy on the head at all.  it goes with just about any outfits."
4.0,Great only for winter as thick stockings but they are too think to make it look real as it bilges when you bend your knees. They fit right for my body weight and hight
4.0,Love the dress. Got many complaints on how beautiful the dress is.
4.0,Warm slippers. Synthetic material and not so breathable so your feet may sweat in them. Good quality though
4.0,"Bought this for my husband for snowstorms and he is shoveling the driveway. Great hat. Nice fit, not itchy and he wears it. will be buying more for other family members."
4.0,These were perfect! Had them in my ears for a few months and have t taken them out. The only reason it didn‚Äôt get five stars is the post is a little longer and doesn‚Äôt stay close to the ear. But not noticeable much
4.0,Wel made
4.0,I like the comfortable fit.
4.0,Love everything about this dress. Fits TTS.
4.0,Beautiful pattern.  The fabric feels nice.
4.0,Tried it on for the first time. And it fits.
4.0,"Nice suit, lasted two summers. Decent quality, and cute."
4.0,Was really impressed with the quality
4.0,"I was not completely satisfied with my initial sunglasses, however the outstanding customer service team took extra measures to make sure I would be completely happy with my next pair. I now have the gold framed aviators with blue lens. It's a little large for my face, however I really like the color contrast and also that I know I will get complete coverage from sun in my eyes. I love the case they come with. I think with a great company who cares about their customers, you are bound to be satisfied."
4.0,"These slippers are surprisingly comfortable for their price although not perfect. The main problem is the back part of the slipper, where the heel counter (that is, the back ""rim"") gets under the heel of my foot. To avoid this problem, I bought slippers that are much larger than my size, so that my heel does not reach the heel counter.<br /><br />SIX MONTHS LATER: The slippers developed small cracks in their rubber soles. If they get on wet floor, they suck water almost like a sponge through those cracks and get wet inside. The practical limitation is that they should not be left in the bathroom when taking shower. The cracks do not pose any problem on dry floor."
4.0,Material is super thick
4.0,It does run small. I ordered one size up and it was still too small.  I had to send it back. But overall it was a great top.  Just wish it had fit.
4.0,"Okay,  5'4"" 190lbs,  ordered the XL and it was not flattering.<br /><br />Material was thin and definitely summer comfortable, however the dress looked like a tent.  There was no shape and the side slit was more in the front.<br /><br />IF you're considering buying this,  order a size down. I mean that's a good thing,  right?"
4.0,"Really nice quality, but definitely bigger than I thought (I got a small). I received this item at a discounted price in return for a review."
4.0,"The dress material is nice, not thin so it falls nicely and doesn‚Äôt cling. The pockets are deep enough to hold your phone or keys without them falling out. The fit is where I was disappointed, I typically wear a medium and/or a 7/8 but this dress just fits too large."
4.0,"I was tempted to not get this outfit because there was no reviews but I am glad I did because I like it. I can't wait to dress it up. The fabric is soft and flowy. I love the slits on the side as well. I am 166 and got the large to be safe and it fits nice with room.<br />Update: So I finally got a chance to wear it, but had to change into my friend clothes because I had no idea I wouldn't be able to sit in it. This outfit is for the Brave, because when you sit it opens  up to the panty line and it was just too revealing for me. This outfit is for the beach."
4.0,I really like these leggings. I love the pockets because they are so big. My only negative is sometime they roll down a little bit depending on what I'm doing but I would still recommend this product.
4.0,It is a small watch so have that in consideration before buying it
4.0,Now this is cool stuff!  Try it in the dark!
4.0,I like this design and functionality. I can wear it fine but I wish there would be a little bit more slack on the velcro fastening.
4.0,"Only watch I ever need, but I had the face rotated so that it could be more easily read when pulled from the pocket. Wish it was sold in rotated form, and carried a larger battery so it would run longer."
4.0,"The tights are a beautiful as-pictured gradient of hot pink to dark purple. It's not a very gradual color change though, if you were looking for something with more in between shades.<br /><br />I didn't check the sizing because I did not actually buy these with the intent to wear them on my legs. However I did try them on just to see how they looked, and they didn't quite fit over my butt--but I do have meaty calves and watermelon crushing thighs. Throw them in the washing machine on cold and then dry them stretched between two hangers if you want to help your chances of them fitting a bit better.<br /><br /> [I plan to use them as sleeves for RWBY's Lie Ren (his volume 4 timeskip outfit).]"
4.0,I love this African Print dress. It looks great on me. I bought this for our black history event. Highly recommend.
4.0,Bit smaller and shorter than expected but good for a tropical vacation as a bathing suit cover.
4.0,"I really enjoy these plugs. I do think they are true to size for me and that was something I was concerned about from other reviews. Although I will say, I do think the stone plugs fall out easy at night. Maybe that‚Äôs just me. So I‚Äôve been wearing the wood ones more often and they give me no trouble at all. I love these and would recommend them to anyone looking for good quality plugs."
4.0,Comfort and very warmly
4.0,I'm not sure if I accidentally ordered the shirt too small but it's a short shirt but very cute. It comes from China so it's small. It's see through-ish so I will have to wear a tank top underneath it but I'm looking forward to the weather getting warmer so I can wear it with a cute pair of shorts.
4.0,"It‚Äôs more for pics and casual wearing, like to sit by the beach not to actually swim. It stretches a lot and even more when wet. Also, it has no breast support...better for smaller chested women, I‚Äôm a 36D"
4.0,Light weight<br />True to size
4.0,"If you adore the Omega Seamaster this is naturally going to peak your interest. It did mine instantly, so I did some research and decided I‚Äôll save $4k and get the Pagani. Upon receiving I was 50/50 on if I liked it. The grey wave pattern face is beautiful, but you instantly notice the indices/hour markers are about 30% smaller then the images show. Which is kind of a bummer. My 6‚Äôo clock marker is way crooked, saying it‚Äôs below the date window so my eye is always drawn to it. The blued hands are beautiful and the lollipop seconds hand with lume are great. As for lume, it‚Äôs about as good as the Casio Duro which is terrible. The sapphire Crystal is just as thick as they say, time will tell how durable it is. The ceramic bezel is breathtaking, the color, the design, the 12‚Äôo clock marker are all done so well. The stainless steel bezel design is gorgeous, although the way it‚Äôs designed isn‚Äôt my favorite for grip. For looks it‚Äôs so clean. The 90 click bezel is nice and strong and in no way feels cheap. The stainless steel case is so beautifully brushed and has no harsh spots that feel sharp. I was very impressed with the crown, being signed is a nice touch and the crown guards are perfect. As for the movement this is the first time I‚Äôm getting to use the Seiko NH35, the screw down feels good and smooth but going from the first position which is wind to the second position is tricky. But once you get it, it clicks together very strong and feels smooth. The case back is done well. Now if you‚Äôve seen one Seiko open case back then this is just the same, not much to look at in the way of beauty. It‚Äôs a solid looking movement. The laser etched font on the screw down case back looks great, tastefully done. I really enjoyed the curved end rubber bottom nylon weave top straps. They don‚Äôt feel stiff in any way so instantly putting on feels great. The clasp is beautiful, great design and doesn't catch hairs or feels itchy. And being a signed clasp is very nice touch. Because of Covid I‚Äôve chosen to use my own strap and clasp until this all blows over. All in all time will tell how good this watch truly is and this is just a first impression review. After purchasing this color I‚Äôm interested in what the white face on a steel band would be like. Cheers!"
4.0,A little small and shorter than expected
4.0,"ok, I travel for a living  so... I like it, it looks nice.  The aluminum  kickstand inside the bag tends to release from its Velcro retainers when checked at the airport.  Build quality is good, handle is strong.  When open there is no support for the lid so its much like half a duffel bag and wont prop open.  The big downer is there are no provisions for a hand held bag hook,  I'm improvising but wish it had one.  The side straps do a good job of holding everything inside the bag together when checked and they are a big plus, I wish they were larger straps and heavier material with a mid bag strap.  Over all its nice luggage and I recommend it, its light and durable and attractive."
4.0,"Not a lot of support for the breasts, but otherwise very comfortable and fits true to size.  The colors are a little ""muddied"" and dull, though, which is my main objection.  Not at all bad, though, for the price.  And having adjustable straps is a big plus."
4.0,The band is pretty but the drawstring loosens overtime. You have to re tighten it pretty often. Other than that it is really pretty and matches most other rose gold accessories.
4.0,Good size not too large and not too small.  I like all of the pockets too.
4.0,"Belt was larger than expected. It looks cheap, not inexpensive but cheap. It works as expected. I bought it in case I might have to use my belt on occasion to do something other than hold my pants up. It works perfect for the multiple uses I purchased it for. It does not loosen unexpectedly. Great product but it appears cheap. It doesn't look like a tactical belt."
4.0,"I have been searching for a dress for my daughter's upcoming wedding, and I kept coming back to this one.  I ordered a large and an X-Large based on reviews.  I'm normally a size 14 at 5'4&#34; 185 lbs.  I tried the X-Large on first and got stuck.  I can't blame the dress though.  I've been doing massage for eleven years and my arms are large.  I tried again when someone else could zip it.  It's snug and I initially wanted to get a XX-Large, but my mother and daughter convinced me to keep the one I modeled for them.  They were concerned the dress would lose it's shape if I purchased a larger size.  The bodice fits great, it's just the arms.  The fact that it's advertised as red and purple drew my attention because purple is a wedding color.  It is definitely more of an electric blue, but still very pretty.  It's wrinkled and I will have to steam it before wearing, but I'm excited to wear it.  I will post pictures after the big day.<br /><br />I ended up returning the XL for a XXL.  I don't own anything else that is a XXL, but this fit perfectly.  I got so many compliments.  I would definitely buy this again."
4.0,Ordered for prom  great quality.  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,"I purchased this for my partner, at her request. We‚Äôre both happy with the product‚Äôs appearance, but less so than another similar item purchased at the same time (it‚Äôs a subjective matter in any case). The hinge is somewhat flimsy, but not so flimsy the jewelry might fall out. We still think this was a good deal. If this product lasts a fraction of how long my partner‚Äôs previous septum jewelry lasted (she had it in for ~5 years before the finish started looking bad enough to replace), it‚Äôll be worth the price."
4.0,"I love the earrings. The look just like the picture, but they didn't come with earrings backs."
4.0,"Nice dress too small for me,I gave to my daughter"
4.0,The fit is fine but color of band is suboptimal for my taste.
4.0,"These barefoot sandals are surprisingly comfortable but do seem a bit fragile. I plan to wear them for my wedding on the beach and I just hope that none of the gems or stones fall out before then. They are beautiful though and do not look cheap. Great price and less then you would spend on the same product from other sellers like etsy, etc."
4.0,i like them but there a bit to small for my nose
4.0,"I got the Large and it fit like a medium. Ideally, it would probably fit someone that was a size 8-10. I'm a size 12 with broad shoulders and big boobies (5'3 175) it was way too tight, especially around the arms. I gave it 3 starts because their measurements were not accurate and I can't return it. However, it was really well made and the material was thick with nice lining. Too bad I can't wear it until I lose at least 15 lbs. :\"
4.0,Very comfortable and so easy to put on and take off. Quality is good.
4.0,"I have really enjoyed this dress! After first buying the purple, I bought it again in pink and green. It is super comfy and works great as a maternity dress! For reference I am 5' 5&#34;, about 165, and 28 weeks pregnant, and I got a large. I don't buy clothes online very often, but I think it fits as expected. Surprisingly, I didn't have to hem it. It comes very close to touching the ground though. Shipping was quick (within 1 week). Very pleased with my purchase!"
4.0,"Love these rings and they came very quick I just thought they would be gold like the pic that's the reason I ordered them but they were silver, I still wear them though."
4.0,"A little strange under the arms, but overall good."
4.0,We had a shrimp boil for Christmas and these kept everyone's shirts clean. Just throw them away when you're done.
4.0,Adorable but fit kind of tight. Shrink in the wash.
4.0,Very good product. I have several bands and use this one the most!
4.0,"A little small, thin leather not very sturdy"
4.0,"Fits okay, fabric stretches during day from sitting."
4.0,Bend easily but really unique and cute.
4.0,Pretty and true to size. FYI see tnrough.
4.0,I love the design of it and the keychain shield but the material for the lanyard is pretty weak. Less than a month after i got it and the thing open at the the bottom where the clip is. I wouldn't complain because i was really happy with it at first so but i wish it wouldnhave lasted longer other than that i thought it was a great buy. The mini shield keychain is dope and has a good feel to it worth it for the price.
4.0,"I got a large and it‚Äôs cute but it‚Äôs not white, it‚Äôs an off white color.it has stretch and lays very nicely. I would consider getting the black."
4.0,"The product is exactly as I expected.  It fits great, it's soft and warm."
4.0,Bigger then I imagined but works just as described
4.0,i like it but it was too small for me.
4.0,Kept her little hands dry. A little big for 18 month old but very nice product.
4.0,Good quality; runs a bit small. Size Up
4.0,These are nice thick socks that do not ride down as you walk. They are very nice and soft. This is great for me when I go to the gym as I don't have to worry about the socks starting to come off as I am running on the treadmill. The only thing is it's not as breathable as some of my other socks that I have.
4.0,Runs small. I was expecting it to be big on me as I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. It is actually a little tight. Love the material and it‚Äôs very warm
4.0,"Very cool design. The plastic teeth on the inside of the belt seem to be durable. My only complaint is that the buckle has a top and bottom so the belt can only be put on one way (really only deserves a half star ding for that, not the full star.) The release latch is at the bottom of the belt buckle and feels secure. It has not slipped or loosened in all of the time that I've been wearing it.<br />Package arrived quickly and in a very nice box and bag that could make this a very nice gift if one was inclined to gift a belt."
4.0,I loved the dress but the bust was quite tight for the sizing that it said.  It is a cute and comfortable dress and quite short.  I didn't keep it and wish they made it one size larger......
4.0,Loved the jerseys but they fit a little small.  They still worked out fine.
4.0,Definitely sufficed as a decent gift idea for its softness but it definitely could be a lot heavier quality.
4.0,"Not quiet as breathable as I'd hoped. I bought the purple one and the yellow one, and kept the yellow one."
4.0,Loved this and super cute. Only reason why a missing star is that it started to come undone on the sleeve at the end. But we where able to sew it up. I would buy it again.
4.0,"Really cute dress! Love the yellow color, love the flowers. It seems like it would be see through because the material is so thin but I just make sure to wear nude colors under it and it is fine. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 150 and a medium fit perfectly, is a little short due to my height but over all cute dress for the price!"
4.0,"Really like this watch. Very pretty, nice size and shape, sparkly crystal trim. The reason I didn't give this watch a 5 star rating is for lack of instructions on how to remove links from the band. - small tool which came with it was useless in removing pins. Finally had to take this to a jeweler to have 3 links removed. This didn't cost much, but was inconvenient."
4.0,"I love the dress it is made great, but I am 5' 9"" and it's definitely shorter than I would've liked. I like my maxi dresses to at least touch the top of my foot, this shows my ankles."
4.0,"Arrived fast,  great for the price!"
4.0,"fits fine! but I will say that it is a bit more flimsy than the image suggests. I expected it to have a good strong form, but its more loose."
4.0,"I needed a professional-looking work bag that can fit my slim 14&#34; laptop, hold my travel items while I am business trips, and still look appropriate for everyday wear.  This bag completely fits the bill.  It's fairly light and is the perfect size.  I did deduct a star because the gold embellishments were scratched, there were lines on the bag, and as weird as this sounds, it's not as black as I expected.  The pleather looks fake, but for the price, I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,I'm impressed. For the price it's a good deal. Had no problem with delivery either.
4.0,"I'm 16 and needed a leotard for my new dance class. I'm a total beginner, so I had so idea what to expect in terms of fit and comfort. This leotard is so cute and so comfortable! Size XL fits me perfectly! The lace detail on the back is so flattering, and the only downside is the clip in the back. It's very, very annoying to try and fasten without help, but after many aggravated sighs, I got it. This leotard fits those with small chests, wide backs, side rolls, love handles, wide hips, and round abdomens. I have been struggling to find a leotard that would fit my body type, but this is it! Great for people who wear XL in women's clothing. Don't hesitate to try it out!"
4.0,"Love the length, the color, the feel of the dredd. Sadly didn't fit on the arms (fat arms), the rest of the body fitted perfect. Would buy if it were larger size."
4.0,fits bigger than expected
4.0,Does the job. Fits my large calfs quite well.
4.0,Little to long for my 5.1 hight. Got a medium
4.0,"Great fit for my fitbit. Seems very durable and is suitable for everyday wear. The directions for removing the pins were intimidating at first, but after removing the first pin, it became very easy. The pin removal kit is very good and has more than enough pieces to get the job done for a comfortable fit."
4.0,"It's beautiful,...but once again the size was not advertise correctly<br />otherwise the it would be 5 stars"
4.0,I was unsure about the size because I have wide feet.  I normally like to try shoes on rather than buy online for that reason.  The fit is perfect and the boots are comfy and warm.  I have them on right now
4.0,"I'm kind of a wallet collector, I guess you could say. Half of the top drawer in my nightstand is full of different wallets. I have wallets made from leather, vinyl, nylon, duct tape, PU leather, plastic, metal, elastic, etc.. I even have a couple made out of old fire hoses!<br /><br />I've tried a lot of wallets.. and I've come to know what I like about them and what I don't. I will admit that I've mostly switched to front pocket wallets in recent years, as they are much more comfortable for long drives and long TV/movie marathons, but I stand all day at work, so it's not really a factor there.<br /><br />Anyway, about this wallet. It seems very well made and feels like you would serve you well for many years. The leather is nice and thick. The stitching all looks really clean and well done. The card slots are lined with smooth nylon/poly fabric. The bill slot is lined with a soft cotton/blend fabric. All in all, it's a very nice quality wallet.<br /><br />That being said, I would not call this a front pocket wallet based on what I consider those to be. If the magnetic money clip wasn't there, I could be convinced to call it a ""large front pocket"" wallet. My current front pocket wallet is holding 4 credit cards, 4 gift cards, 1 public transit pass, 1 national parks pass, 1 driver license, $81 in bills (4), and a business card sized coupon for a free corn dog.<br /><br />I transferred all of that (minus the corn dog coupon) to this Wolverine wallet to give it a test run. Boy was I disappointed. You can see from my photos that this wallet got pretty thick after loading it up. I included several photos of this wallet empty and full, as well as my current wallet full. Hopefully these will help in comparing them.<br /><br />The picture with my current wallet (full; incl the corn dog coupon) and this wallet (empty) side by side is pretty interesting. For a ""front pocket"" wallet, this one seems quite large. Even if the magnetic money clip wasn't there, this wallet empty would still be bulkier than my current wallet full.<br /><br />I know this was long and probably boring.. but like I said, I'm pretty into wallets. I'm not sure when or how it started.. probably something to do with not being able to afford a new car during a mid-life crisis, so buying wallets seemed close enough to money.. that, well.. something like that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good wallet. It seems made very well, and the leather feels very strong. If it's size works for you, then I highly recommend it. It's just too big for me to consider it ""front pocket"" sized since I also carry my phone in the same pocket as my wallet. My left pocket is a whole other mishmash of a ring of keys (home/office/moms), multi-tools (2), a pen, a USB drive, my car remote, etc. We probably shouldn't get going on that."
4.0,"This look well made, but is a little bit small, and are not very shiny, maybe better to wear on Helix or Orbital not good for standard lobe, this is for 1 earing only"
4.0,"Gave these a 4 star rating because they are soft, yet rugged and great work gloves. But they are not warm. My fingers and hands froze in these every time I used them. I‚Äôm in NC so they would really be bad in cold places. 5 stars everywhere else. 1 star on warmth."
4.0,"Cute, fits good."
4.0,"The black isn‚Äôt the blackest, it‚Äôs more a grey with the teal sparkle. Otherwise they are great for the price!"
4.0,"the band is great quality, as i expected. the only potential downside is it seems as if its for a large wrist altho it is not designated as such. i only have two holes to chose from. if i lose weight (HA) i will only have one - i suppose there are worse things. now if i GAIN weight (yikes) i have 5 holes to chose from. the wegner band it replaced put me right about in the middle and wasnt as long.<br />anyway - great band, just doesnt need to be so long since they do make larger bands - cant imagine how big they must be!"
4.0,"I love the necklace - beautiful.  Sadly it came in a zip-lock bag, when the description clearly says &#34;boxed&#34; necklace.  It is a gift and a box would have been nice."
4.0,Not a bad dress for the price.  Wore a crochet vest over and it was very cute.  It is very see through but great for the spring/ summer coming up.  I‚Äôm a true size 4 and the small fit perfect.
4.0,Inside mask is cracked and the bottom inside part almost looks like they tried to glue it. Want to return but don't want the hassle and my kid wants to wear it anyway. Just disappointed.
4.0,Nice wallet but doesn‚Äôt loook like real leather.
4.0,Good fit and very comfy
4.0,Looked nice but hurt the ear a little due to larger size.
4.0,"Fit good, baggy like I like. Pretty true to mens sizing."
4.0,"Doesn't stretch very well at the top.  Probably so that with regular sized calfs, they won't fall down."
4.0,"I love the cross and necklaces. It came with 3 different sizes of necklaces. Made of heavy material. I thought it would be 925 Sterling Silver, even though has 925 engraved on it, it is not or I would have gave it 5 stars. Other than that,I'm happy with my new cross and necklace."
4.0,Only reason for a 4 star rating is that they are quite small so I'm guessing if you are larger that a US size 8 don't buy. Otherwise I'm am very happy.
4.0,"I like it, but not love it! It is decent quality, but not worth the price. I was hoping I loved it. I wear size 4 pants & 36 bust line & the cover up is over sized."
4.0,"Shoe is true to size, I bought a toddler size 5. I was worried the shoe strap was short but its long enough and fits perfectly. Good quality shoe for the price.The only issue I found is that the shoe is a bit chunky, my son stumbles sometimes. They almost look heavy for a toddler, but it's lightweight."
4.0,"I am 5&#34;5 and 190lbs. I got a large because that is what I normally wear, and according to the reviews- it fit as expected. Unfortunately that was not the case for me. I will be returning it and exchanging it for a larger size, because the skirt was gorgeous. Great material, and looks like the picture. I cant wait to get a size that fits!"
4.0,super cute and comfy. great for the casual office!
4.0,A little too big but still super cute!
4.0,"I give this 4 stars liberally just based on how much my kid likes it. Everything is exactly how he imagined. Now, the gloves were too long but easily fixable to cut back the finger length. The other issue is the stitching on the hat. It wasn‚Äôt great and I imagine it will need to be redone on my end pretty quickly. The quality wasn‚Äôt great but for the price I expected it. You get what you pay for and in that aspect it‚Äôs exactly what I thought it would be. If you want amazing quality I would maybe pass but fora kid to play with its fine.<br /><br />Image of glove is on my adult lady hand."
4.0,My son loves them. They are a little bit difficult to introduce.
4.0,"I like the shirts, I've just noticed that the material they use for these shirts makes me smell musty a lot faster than other workout clothes I have. Other than that, its nice around my arms and chest."
4.0,"This ran a little smaller than I expected, but other than that it is great.  My daughter wore it under a dress we bought on Amazon for my wedding and she looked adorable!!"
4.0,Drapes nicely.but it is not long sleeved. Lace is a nice added touch.
4.0,"So, I bought this by accident under the &#34;one click purchase&#34; feature. I have ever plan on returning it until I got them item. I figured &#34;why the hell not?!&#34; and tried it on. Fits great and looks great.  The only downside is the material is a bit thin and it was very wrinkled. will need to be washed before use."
4.0,Really wish they would stay up better. Garter belt needed.
4.0,"It's a small fit, but overall good.  It also loose hair very easily."
4.0,"Nice weight, pretty color. I like the way the collar lies when unzipped or partially zipped"
4.0,build quality is just ok. good for starters
4.0,Nice color and details. I surprised my husband and he put on immediately. Gives a more stylish and professional upgrade to the smartwatch.
4.0,It fits well in my 13 weeks baby's head but the sequin bow is quite large. Cute though!
4.0,Fit was flattering and the shirt is very pretty. I don't dry the shirt but hang to dry and the bottom seam still shrunk a bit after about 2-3 months. Still a flattering shirt but the lace gets worn pretty quickly even without drying in the machine.
4.0,"I got a 3X and it just fits I usually wear 18/20. The fabric is thin, but it is beach wear. I love that it has pockets."
4.0,A bit on the small side for a slouchy hat... and had a liner inside I would just as soon not had. People with normal sized heads should be happy with it though.
4.0,"A little smaller than expected, so order a size larger.  Work very well, even in forest environments.  Not nicking, hanging, or tearing as you would expect when being ran through brush.  Great buy."
4.0,"Although I'll keep this for a costume I need it for, because I don't want to spend any more time energy or money on a minor project , it's disappointing. Beads fall off, gobs of glue dot the top. I had to repair it myself. Too bad, because it's perfectly shaped and the intended design would have made a nice product if the makers had been halfway conscientious and efficient!"
4.0,"I ordered these Hanna Andersson T shirts thinking I‚Äôd give them to my five year old grandson, but they run so small that I gave them to the three year old instead. They‚Äôre a size 5 but look and fit more like a 4. That is my only criticism though. These are wonderful T shirts, made from a soft, stretchy cotton fabric. Do not expect them to feel like American-made White T shirts, because they are very different. The fabric almost has a subtle, fine rib to it which makes it much more supple and stretchy than typical white T shirts. The comfort level seems to be much greater with these T‚Äôs from Hanna Andersson. Just know that you will want to size up."
4.0,"The necklace is pretty, but more peach than pink.  The chain has sharp edges and digs in, so I replaced the chain part with chain from a craft store in the jewelry making department."
4.0,Todo muy bueno y r√°pido gracias üôÇ
4.0,"Nice for, flattering and would buy again."
4.0,Love this dress fits great just a little to long but I had it altered. I am 5 6&#34; and weighs 178 lbs I took the large and it fits great.
4.0,"my only issue is the color is more of a brown than a true green, but it fits great and it is really soft"
4.0,"I ordered the blue smoke shade, and the ones that arrived are clearly black. I still like them as they REALLY flatter my face, which few sunglasses do. I would even say they make me look a bit thinner and younger??? LOL<br /><br />The glasses feel well made and sturdy. They are a bit big, but not too bad at all.<br /><br />Buy a case to keep them in so they stay nice longer. If you're fussy about the color, call the company after you order so as to make SURE you get the right color!<br /><br />Lens shade is not too dark - I can see very well out of them.<br /><br />They look expensive, so it's great to get them for so cheap.<br /><br />They did arrive very promptly."
4.0,Luv the color the size is perfect just needs to be more comfortable more memory foam
4.0,"I like that these come with a nice large size cleaning cloth and a baggie to store them in. I also like that the acetate frames are more blended tortoise, rather than yellow dot like the online photos depict. I am not a fan of how flat the front of these sunglasses are. They do fit my small face and head quite well which is a huge plus!"
4.0,The dress fit perfectly and is ideal for the office. One downside is the material is a little thinner than antipated but it did not take away from the look of the dress as you can throw a jacket over it to add to the professional look.
4.0,I got these for my daughter and she loves them!
4.0,It's really cute.  the color is a bit faded and does not look as fresh like the picture. It runs a little bigger than normal.
4.0,"I got these for a couple of purposes. First, to function as a face shield as I sometimes wear a mask and at other times, the mask hangs around my neck on a lanyard. Indoors, I still use a mask. But outdoors, when it's warm and I can keep a distance from folks (despite being vaccinated), I like that I have this and still have my mask handy. This, by contrast, doesn't make me too warm. Also, I am using this as a huge set of sunglasses and face cover to keep the sun out of my eyes and face. I walk a lot and also wear glasses. I often have the sun in my eyes. This goes right over my glasses, stays in place and doesn't slide down on walking. It definitely cuts down in the direct glare and gives a muted effect without turning everything brown or grey like sunglasses do. Also, I don't have to use contacts just so I can wear sunglasses. These go right over my glasses and there is no discomfort. It's good for games. The thing I'm concerned about is that it came a little broken and I had to fix it. Poor packaging. I wonder, now that it's been banged up and fixed, how long it might last. Having said that, it's priced well and if it doesn't last on account of where I had to fix it, I could just buy another. This was the only reason I gave it 4 stars and waited to post a review. It hasn't fallen apart yet. A properly packaged piece would get an easy 5 stars. It could also be used by someone in the beauty profession/salon setting."
4.0,"I like the leggings, but probably should have gone with the medium.  Small is snug"
4.0,"Sparkling stones, but my ears were sensitive to the metal."
4.0,nice but not to size
4.0,"NOT true to size, runs small."
4.0,Got these for my husband who is unsteady at walking.  These help him not to slip on tile floor
4.0,"very good for the price,very nice,little tide I hope with the time get loose but is not a big problem"
4.0,"nice shoes for kids. they fit well, so far no complaints. Kids are happy."
4.0,Very pretty and well made. Perfect for a gift.
4.0,"I like the shirt but sizing runs small.  I ordered a large and it's more like a medium,, should of got an extra large."
4.0,Love the colors but a little tight.don‚Äôt stay in place
4.0,see through up top but really cute
4.0,"It's a quality product and well made. However, there is some slipping with fine hair."
4.0,"Great deal , sturdy but getting it to fit is a whole other story"
4.0,I love this shirt except for the fact it needs to be ironed.
4.0,"Outfit fit very well, i am 5'4&#34; 165lbs i ordered a large and the only issue i had with this outfit were the sleeve being a little too short but i got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,Quality seems great so I don't want to give us a bad review it's just way bigger  so I have to return it sadly
4.0,This fits like you would expect. It would look nice as a work outfit. The fabric isn't very soft. In fact the whole thing feels like stretchy pants. I think it would get very warm and not really breathe in the summer time. It also has apiece of fabric that goes right across the chest.
4.0,"The cape is super cool, but some of the feathers aren't tightly assembled.<br /><br />The horns are great but the styrofoam somehow gets slowly pushed out (i.e. towards the ""inside"", where the head is). They also run kind of big but I guess that's good for men or women with long hair who want to tuck it in.<br /><br />PS - note that the only 1 star review is that it's too scary haha. I feel that should be a 5 star review!"
4.0,"Sturdy and fit well. Came with nice zippered case and cleaning cloth.  Clarify vision for night driving, especially at dusk."
4.0,Really like the watch
4.0,"It is beautiful.....however, it is a bit large (the ring and bracelet will both need to be altered to wear it)."
4.0,They are a pretty shade of light blue-gray and go great with jeans for casual wear.
4.0,Really good. Prefer the triple chocolate chip cookies
4.0,Love em‚Äô
4.0,"Nice jacket, nice quality."
4.0,"For the price you can't beat this purchase, but I give it 4 stars because it wasn't as feminine as I would have liked it to be for my girlfriend!"
4.0,The shirt is fine.  The size chart is off.  Im 6‚Äô 180 with muscular build and the large is too small out of the box before even washing.
4.0,"Fits perfectly and looks good, but too long , I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, the pants are made for like super tall people 6‚Äô feet women, I cut 3 inch off the pants but it was still too long for me"
4.0,"Item was fairly good quality and weight, definitely had tortoiseshell buttons and not the exact neckline in the picture but was fine for my purposes as I sewed the neckline to change it for a costume piece! Came quickly and size was as described."
4.0,"I love these yard gloves.  I love using my hands to garden, and I find that since I'm right-handed, I instinctively grasp with my right hand.  There are times that I have to remove my right glove, so that I can grasp what I'm trying to pick up.  Just a tiny inconvenience for me.  I would still buy these again.  My next door neighbor loved mine so much, she bought some for herself."
4.0,If the buttons were not so easy to detach would have given 5 stars
4.0,Fast shipping. Fit like stated :)
4.0,"My wrist size is exactly 5.5 inches. This bracelet which is advertised to fit all wrists 5.5 to 9 Inches should rather be advertised to fit all wrists 6 to 9 inches. It fits very loosely on my wrist and has a tendency to slide around. That is why I gave it only a four star. Otherwise, it is beautiful, exactly as pictured. Mine easily adjusts, and it looks great. High quality. I absolutely love it! I just wished I could pull it a little tighter... I have not had any trouble with color &#34;bleeding&#34; so far (have had it for about a month) but I also live in a dry climate."
4.0,"I am told that this product is made well & comfortable to wear for the most part. Where it can be improved is where the material covers the abdomen. That area needs to be made of the same stronger material as the rest of it for more support. Otherwise it stays up and does Not roll down at all and you can wear it all day & night, plus it feels nice."
4.0,for the price its ok..
4.0,I love the style of these sunnies. I took them with me on a weekend trip and they look great but they do feel a little heavy on my nose and sometimes they slip a little but I still will wear them!
4.0,"I had to get the 12 because of them making the waist kind of tight, it fits all right, but it is a very full wide skirt, kind of too full.  It is made nicely and lined, though.  I wear it with knee high boots and a sweater in the winter for church, it looks cute."
4.0,Just like the picture and my daughter loves it.
4.0,They're cute for my toddler but the back on one was screwed in crooked and I almost broke it trying to get it apart to put in her ears
4.0,"Adorable dress, a big hit but won't fit for long, running small."
4.0,Looks good but I haven't used it yet because I live in a warmer climate and I think the heavy scarf to be warn with this needs to be  a more loosely woven fabric because the pin on the brooch is very bid and would destroy a finer woven fabric.  waiting for the right day and the right scarf.
4.0,the zipper was trash and broke when i wore it. but i had a camelback on so it covered the opening. im going to buya zipper and sew it on.  seriously amazingly cute
4.0,The fit was perfect for me.  The blouse is very well made and the wuality of fabric better than I expected.  Very pleased with the product.
4.0,Good value watch
4.0,"I just got these shoes and I think they're great!  I recommend getting a half-size smaller, if possible.  I wear 7.5 (and my foot is slightly wide) and I found the 7 to fit perfectly.  It's leather, so it should stretch a bit if it doesn't fit right away, anyway.  I like these shoes--I think they are very comfortable.  Because of the angle, there is basically no strain on your foot, yet you get the height you want!  Casual yet funky!  I think they go with just about everything."
4.0,Pretty good just that pins for links were to hard to remove. Broke couple pushout pins from watch tools. Normally other link pins come out easy.
4.0,Product is lightweight so you definitely need some type of support underneath.  Arms seem to be long but I'm able to roll under.  I do like the feel of it and believe it will protect me from the sun.
4.0,I like it very much. It fits me perfectly
4.0,My only complaint is the color is different than the picture on line. I expected a Kelly green bottom its more of a real
4.0,Cute love it good quality sits weird on my wrist tho but way better quality than I thout good price for the product
4.0,"The shirt is good for the plus sized girl that does not want a long tunic.  I would have given it 5 stars but the sleeves are a bit form fitting, otherwise it is perfect. Going to order a second one."
4.0,"I am grateful for this wrap. I am a black natural haired female who works out 3-4 days a week. Yes, I do sweat but the difference is noticeable and not as heavy. Also, I followed suggestion of keeping tied for 30 minutes after I am done, and it works perfectly. By the time I drive home from my work outs 30 minutes has passed and my style is still in tact. However, I have to apply edge control to my edges, but definitely cannot complain about that when it saves my style overall!"
4.0,"I was a little apprehensive after reading all the reviews. The fly is a little smaller than standard and they are slightly tighter around the thighs than other boxers. The fabric is comfortable and so far the construction seems pretty good. The value is so exceptional that I would absolutely recommend (if recommending underpants was something men actually did). I would say I would purchase them again, but seriously, who needs that many pairs of boxers?"
4.0,"The bottom of the shoe needs to be made with a better grip for such a high heel. Overall, I really like them. Satisfied."
4.0,I'd say it runs a size small but I love the dress and got a ton of compliments!
4.0,"Honestly, for the price, this was a lovely piece. The rubies were bright (I have no skill in jewelry) and it was well received. I ultimately ended up returning it as the person I bought it for needed something a little bit more delicate. The links of the bracelet were just a little thicker than what she likes, and the bracelet was less like a chain (stiffer) than I was hoping.<br />That said, a ruby bracelet for this price is hard to beat.<br />I will admit extreme hesitancy in buying jewelry off of Amazon prior to this. But this experience was very positive, and I will have less worry in the future."
4.0,"As expected, they work well and are great for concerts or loud environments for kids.  My daughter is 4 and didn't mind wearing them for an extended period of time.<br /><br />I would give a 5 star rating but one of the ear muffs falls off the headset regularly - when it's not on someone's head.  The clip doesn't appear to be broken or anything, just doesn't stick together well.<br /><br />Overwork - worked as I had hoped and is a good value for the price."
4.0,The cap fits as expected and the brim was curved as pictured.  It's a great value for the money.  My only reason for giving it 4 instead of 5 stars was that the acrylic felt a little too acrylic.  I've had other hats that have pulled off a less plastic like feel while still being acrylic.
4.0,"I like the material and amount of stretch especially for the price.  HOWEVER, the sizing is waaaaaay off.  I wear 32-33 waist and first bought a large.  These fit like spandex.  I ordered a 4X next based on the sizing and they were just a little more snug than what I liked.  5X are coming tomorrow and will update.  Remember this was for a 32-33 inch waist."
4.0,I love the dress the slit is higher than shown in the the picture and the sizes run small
4.0,"I ordered these to replace my thumb ring that finally gave way. I really like the choices. I like the different styles and like the rings, but I took off one star because they seem to all have rough edges, I have small scratches from wearing them."
4.0,"En general las especificaciones del producto fueron bien exactas.  Personalmente el √∫nico detalle que me afect√≥ un poco es la longitud de los brazos, ya que es un par de cm m√°s peque√±o. En conclusi√≥n, es una buena compra."
4.0,"For the price, it is perfect! Definitely more flimsy and see-through than I thought...but it's coming off anyway right? haha."
4.0,Runs small in size and material is cheap. Ok for one time use.
4.0,The suit fits great. It keeps me together in the pool while exercising. I would have given it a five-star except the pads in the bra area slip a bit and I always have to readjust them when I put the suit on. They are not stitched into the garment but the seam is closed around them so it's hard to adjust. Once I get adjusted and put the suit on it's perfect. Very comfortable and the boy legs give me all the coverage I need. It is modest and fits snuggly allowing me to focus on my aquafit not my suit. I never have to pull and tug to get everything adjusted. I took a chance that the 14 would fit and it's perfect. My last suit was a 16 and a bit big. For the price you absolutely cannot go wrong. After a couple weeks in the water it seems to be holding up well. I am thinking of getting another one in a different color before summer.
4.0,Better quality than we expected. Nice pants. Not a bad deal
4.0,"Very nice watch and looks great for the price point. I've owned it for about half a year now and probably wear it about once a week. Reason there's 4 stars is because there is some wear on the back of the piece already. Maybe its from me sweating more than others, but I really don't wear the watch that often or at a time when I would expect my wrist to rub it the wrong way. Added a picture where the black ink was coming off of the back of the piece. Everything else is in top condition.<br /><br />And obviously very accurate -- its quartz. Haven't tested it but its also on the correct minute 6 months later (5 technically because I adjusted it for daylight savings)."
4.0,Good fit I like these shirts a lot
4.0,Very cute and perfect size for my daughter.
4.0,The Person Received Them Liked Them
4.0,"I bought these for my mother.  She wasn't really sure about them because of the little &#34;pom poms&#34;, but when she got to work, all the younger co-workers had a fit over them.  My only complaint, I wish they were skid proof.  When they hit ice, they are VERY slick and my mom almost slipped in the parking lot."
4.0,Fit as expected. Needed to cut out center metal eyelit as my poke was too thick. Let‚Äôs hope it holds when it gets windy.
4.0,"They fit a bit larger than I expected but the 4 stars is because they don't feel very nice. They are not as tight as some other flat waxed shoelaces that I have, in fact a pair after using them for the second time are kinda falling apart."
4.0,Great jeans. Great price. Be sure to size up though. Even for juniors sizing these are small.
4.0,Overall i like the pajamas.  They have pockets and are nice and soft.  The fit is slightly small but ok.
4.0,Nice in its true sense
4.0,"Liked it,but a little large"
4.0,"My daughter wanted these due to some spots on her legs.. She does like them but the waist was super big I had to sew them in. They are comfortable. They were ankle length, I wasn't really sure from some of the pictures and measurements. Overall seem good and will last."
4.0,I'm a small girl so this didn't fit my head at all bu tit was good for the goofs and gaffs
4.0,"Very cute suit, a little small for an medium. I most likely will onlymhamd wash in case of shrinkage."
4.0,Small only through the sleeves and shoulders.  Otherwise I love it.
4.0,Loved the look..just little heavier than I wanted... but overall great quality
4.0,My granddaughter loves these.  Nice fit true to size
4.0,"Very nice bag -- looks just like pictured.  A little bigger than I planned on, but I like it.  There is an instruction paper for getting rid of bad smells, but the bag doesn't smell bad.  No problems at all."
4.0,The material is of good quality. It fits as expected. I am satisfied.
4.0,"A little flimsy, but gets the job done!"
4.0,Alright for the price I paid...they fit good and they still wear good.
4.0,"Super cute and versatile.  I've worn it out on a date night.  and I  also use it as a cover up at the pool. It looks great with flip flops, sandals, heels, etc.  It is on the short side. A little longer would be better."
4.0,Cute blouse. The material is light and cool to touch. The sleeves has an opening and you can tie a bow.  The blouse is loose fitting but not oversized.  This is great for work.
4.0,Nice soft gloves. Good quality. Good price.
4.0,I just received my coat and I must say I love everything about this coat so far I order a xml because I have hips and a large back side so I wanted to have room being that it's a lager coat .it's roomie I can add layers under it at well and I'm not one for color coats but I did order this in red and I love it on me. Can't wait to wear it and yes I will be ordering  this in black.
4.0,Comfy I use these as pajamas ü§≠
4.0,These are very pretty but also very heavy.  I probably should have gotten the smaller size.  Great value for the $$ and they do look great.
4.0,Liked the style and size.  Ordered black and came as a definite brown which is odd since brown is not an available color. Had to send back.
4.0,"Love this dress! Stretch and fit are great, sleeves are almost too short, wish I would have purchased a medium only for that reason. Don't dry in dryer or will shrink a bit. Other than that I love this dress. Lots of compliments. For reference I'm 5'5 135lbs. Typically wear small/medium. Recommended medium for sleeve length."
4.0,"Just as pictured, nice cut and fabric."
4.0,"This bag is beautiful. One of the back metal pieces broke off soon after purchase, but it's not noticeable. My daughter is taking it on her 1.5 lds mission, so we'll see how it holds up with excessive, heavy daily use."
4.0,"When I travel, I don't like to wear my &#34;good&#34; watch, so I purchased this one -- knowing it could double as an alarm clock.  I found it easy to set the time and alarm, in contrast with several online reviews I read. The alarm isn't deafening, but it woke me up.  The only negative is that the illuminated face isn't very bright, so I couldn't read the time without putting on my glasses (better yet -- turning on the light!)  But it does exactly what I want a cheap travel watch to do -- and I plan to wear it kayaking this summer."
4.0,This is so mush long
4.0,"1. The color is very nice. I really love it.<br />2. Quality is good.<br />3. I feel comfortable in this dress<br />4. Legth : good as I expect<br />5. It is a little bit large  for me because I am slim. I am 5'2"". 100 lbs"
4.0,Well matched high quality earrings. Shipped promptly.
4.0,and not sheer!
4.0,"Lost a star because of them being bent. Otherwise very prompt shipping, good quality, and even comes in its own cute little box! Other companies have these but they are harder to push the top piece in so that's another plus! Would definitely buy from them again!"
4.0,The most important thing is my toddlers really like it. I put it on last night and surprisingly it has pretty soft bottom and top. It looks comfortable on my toddlers that they don‚Äôt take it out like other shoes I had bought for them.
4.0,Great value for the price. Only complaint is that the black is already wearing off a little on the part near the ball.
4.0,great work out gear
4.0,I love the fit and the colors. There is very little true brown on it.
4.0,This is a fun and comfortable party dress! I wore it to a cocktail hour gala at an embassy and received many compliments. I particularly loved the length (on the short side like me) and that the neckline was open and flattering yet modest. And it has POCKETS!!
4.0,I‚Äôve only been wearing them a few days so I can‚Äôt doesk to durability. However they fit good and are comfortable. The only issue is telling the left shoe from the right. I have look at the soles and even those are vague. Still comfortable though even though they may be in the wrong foot.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a98ab3bb0df6d65e38c4245aa425f04]] Not as big as expected.
4.0,"The watch winder was a present to my husband. It works really well and looks great. My husband was super happy to have it as it was something he'd never buy for himself. The reason I gave it 4 stars over 5 is the noise it creates when it is actually winding. If you are a heavy sleeper the noise will be no problem for you; I'm obviously not a heavy sleeper, and the machine sits across our room."
4.0,they‚Äôre cute but attract pet hair.
4.0,Super cute and comfy. Fits how it‚Äôs suppose to
4.0,"Good quality, I only wish they weren‚Äôt so solid!"
4.0,"Great length, hits past elbow. They do roll down a little, but not too bad. Can hand wash if needed"
4.0,"I really like these, the emoticon at the hem is cute. They are nice--not too thin like some. They are very long on me, and I'm 5'8&#34;--but I'd rather have too long than too short!"
4.0,"Great scarf for the price. It is very thin, scratchy material, but what else do you expect for less than $10? Super cute though!"
4.0,Only reason I did not give it five stars was that the battery only lasted for two days after I received the watch.
4.0,"Tried a stretchy, non-adjustable band first, and it stretched out, tried an adjustable one after and it kept loosening up. Bought this and so far seems good. Velcro is sticky, the installation was quick, size held firm throughout the day, and appearance is great. Would be 5 stars but the connection point between the band and the watch is plastic. If that was metal it'd be 5 stars."
4.0,Don‚Äôt care for the button on shirt pocket but otherwise great quality & fit!
4.0,"When I received this product there was no way to get it open. It looked like it was moulded to have an easy-open lid but it was sealed. I managed to get it open with a small knife, but now the lid never stays closed unless there's something heavy sitting on it.<br />That said, the sheet masks inside are absolutely lovely and saturated in product! My skin loves them. I'll buy them again, but will definitely check the packaging more carefully in the future."
4.0,"i'm far from the target audience as a teen boy but hey, it's a good ring and I love ladybugs.<br />bends really easy though, but that might be helpful if you accidentally get the wrong size or something."
4.0,"The fit is great, like how they are tight to the knee then flare out. Bought 2 pairs at different times."
4.0,LOvedmines until it popped
4.0,"Fits like a charm! My reasoning behind 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bralette top doesnt fit snug because the elastic in the bottom seem was not stretched enough when sewn, however I can easily remedy that. The bottoms fit perfect as well as the tank and all in all, it is super comfy. Will def buy again in a diff pattern. I am 5' 8 and about 145 in weight. I bought it in a large."
4.0,It feels stiffer than I hoped for.
4.0,Material was ok. I love the design and bright orange color.
4.0,"Bought for a friend, small scratch. Didn‚Äôt return."
4.0,"Really love the fit and length of it (hit perfectly as a midi length on my 5‚Äô9 frame). I had to line the midsection with ribbon because it looked ridiculous with my pasty stomach showing through (and not as formal as I needed), but I loved it lined. Very flattering and hid stomach imperfections. I wish the lace was slightly tighter as it ripped almost instantly along the zipper since there are areas in the lace where there are big gaps with a teeny tiny string of material holding the shape."
4.0,"Very pretty and adjusting it is so easy. I gave it 4 stars because my daughter hasn't worn it yet, will update on quality when she has worn it a few times"
4.0,"I ordered this item for myself, it was a big small for the breast area and cut into my skin, but perfect otherwise! Good material item. I gave it to my little cousin who looks stunning in it! Just not for me because of the size, but great material!"
4.0,Love this purse...nice and roomy only draw back is there are no zippered pockets on the inside.
4.0,Love this but the yellow is MUCH brighter than the picture shows. Sleeves are snug also
4.0,Bikini is awesome. Well made i/ it also had beading around the bikini which makes it stand out / / would recommend
4.0,This is a different type of necklace . I do like it . It works well when I am in the mood to wear chunky looking necklace. Gives a plain T-shirt look a whole new style.I would recommend to any one that likes a little different look every now and again
4.0,"Love the color.  Fabric is pretty sheer, but not see through."
4.0,"165 lbs , M"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:dcf2ce4218c381fc7acbd5afc3f25571]] I have had this for a couple weeks & it‚Äôs starting to wear off. It works great & keeps my watch safe.
4.0,i love this shirt.  i am a size 18 and the 2x fit right.
4.0,The product is very nice. But it is extremely small and was very hard to get a photo you can see to put inside of it.
4.0,Great color. Easily adjustable custom fit. Exactly what I needed.
4.0,Good and slim
4.0,"This dress was PERFECT for my college graduation. It was flattering, perfect color, everything was great! The only problem I had was one of the strap rings broke so I had to safety pin the strap together."
4.0,My mom loved it as a gift
4.0,Great sunglasses for a party
4.0,"I love all the shirts I get from Patty Boutik.  This one has an issue with the strings on one sleeve.  Had to send it back, but plan on ordering another one.  The fabric was nice, and the fit was perfect.  I"
4.0,"I bought these for a church children's ministry and they are just as described and I'm sure the kids will love them.  Out of the 40 in the bag, however, 10 did not work and some of the on/off switches were a little hard to make work.  Amazon Customer Service was wonderful though and issued me a partial refund, so I am quite satisfied.  Just be aware that some of the lights may not work when they arrive."
4.0,As an RN I am proud to wear this t shirt
4.0,So cute. The shorts aren't made for the washing machine. Hand wash and it may last.
4.0,Great casual pants!  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù weight 123lbs and I ordered medium.  They fit good but a little tight  at high waist. I will NOT put them in dryer after washing them.  They are not thick warm pants to wear in super cold winter days outside but they are cute and stylish and if you take care of them and wash gently and do use dryer they will last.  I wore mine to my doctors office today to get my chemo treatments and got compliments on them üòá
4.0,Super soft and comfy!  Only complain is the arm holes are a bit snug and there is a seam going down the middle that kind of looks like a seam.
4.0,"While adjusting a ring it snapped in half, but overall the rest are in great condition and are worth the money."
4.0,I like the fabric since its not too thick or thin perfect for sleeping. Just get one size up my usual size is small to medium but I got a large and it‚Äôs much better not too fit.
4.0,Cute but I do not like the fabric at all. If you're sensitive to texture don't get it. It's almost a jersey pajama like fabric.  The arms are really tight as well.
4.0,"We got this to give us a reminder all day long. It‚Äôs not to hard to program, and gives you more than enough alarms to set. I like the sleek look and comfortable band. I wish they could have made it more waterproof, but that‚Äôs my only negative thought."
4.0,Fits good really cute.
4.0,I was hoping they were for a childs face... My daughter is 3 so they were a little big but not too much. Went great with her costume. So cute... She wears them all the time now.
4.0,"Love the idea of this blouse the contrast between the pink and the white and specially the collar and fold button details i had been looking for this type of blouse for some time and was glad when i found this one but sadly it did not fit. I usually wear sizes 6 or 8 for tops or M,L and i followed the size chart but still it did not fit so definitely size up. I was some what dissapointed with the material it felt rough. Overall i like the idea of the blouse and would order again if more sizes become available."
4.0,As far as comfort goes these slippers are not the best but the lights work great and are a perfect gift for the person that has everything!
4.0,"these were the perfect pants for an indiana jones costume. my fiancee normally wears 34 but these were a bit tight. we sized up to a 36, and they were just right. easy returns, and quick shipping. refund was issued very fast."
4.0,"Exactly like the picture, Really cute with knee high boots."
4.0,For me it's great for going out on a walk. I really liked it.
4.0,"The hoodie is light and comfortable, definitely size up"
4.0,My husband has owned a few pairs of Nectar sunglasses and loves them. This model broke within a few days of him wearing it for some reason though so we returned it for a new pair. Nectar has a pretty good warranty though!
4.0,"I get so many compliments on these earrings. But I deducted one star because the dangling bits get caught in the loop when you turn your head. I had to remove the dangling bits, but the earrings are still pretty without them."
4.0,Overall this is beautiful. There were done issues with paint around the eye cutouts but I will use touch up paint to fix.
4.0,Well made key chain.  Nice gift for graduates.
4.0,"The shirt is 100% cotton, so taken out of the box, it looked too big, but after washing it fit perfectly."
4.0,This is airy but just heavy enough for cooler days/nights. I get compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"Nice sun reader. I can sit on the beach on a bright, sunny day and read a book!"
4.0,"I ordered my usual size, and it's basically just a regular sweater. Don't get me wrong, it's very nice -- soft, comfy, fits properly -- but if you want it to fit more like the pictures, you're probably going to want two sizes larger. Sleeves aren't that ""poofy"" either."
4.0,It is an attractive dress. It was it little loose for me. I adjusted it and it looks good on the body.
4.0,This watch is awesome!  It looks exactly like the picture and it fits extremely well.  As others have stated - the knob on the right comes out very easily.  It's pretty annoying.  I ended up super gluing it to remain in place.
4.0,The shirt is fine for the price but very see thru!
4.0,I liked it because it looks very elegant. The size of the earings is a little smaller than what I imagined.<br />I recommend it.
4.0,"It was way bigger than I expected. The leathery part is kind of cheap. But over all I like it, just wish it was a bit smaller."
4.0,I got this for my Granddaughters birthday.  She absolutely loves it.  Most definitely a great gift.<br />The face of the water is a bit bigger than you would think.  But it looks good on. It‚Äôs because it has a camera for selfie‚Äôs.
4.0,"I like this product but I find that some of the pockets don't have 'mouths' wide enough to put things in. Other than that, I works quite well! I can carry my IPad, my cell phone, various pens/pencils and paper for writing/drawing, as well as a snack and a gargoyle-type figure to keep the Evil One away!"
4.0,"I love the idea of this bag, especially since Think Geek is no more.  However, the straps on this are a bit odd.  The 2 handle straps are too close together for carrying over shoulder without it feeling awkward, and the longer strap sits at an odd place for me personally, like right at just shy of the right length for a cross-body bag.  Otherwise, it's a nice big bag, seems pretty sturdy, with lots of inside pockets."
4.0,"Comfortable, silky, and washable.  A little big for thin person, but would fit anyone up to size 16 or more."
4.0,"Attached umbrella to backpack shoulder strap for rain or sun protection. Works pretty well, if secured properly. Pain to apply, had to remove shoulder strap from lower connector, thread the two stretchy cord thingys on and reapply the strap. Might be nice to have the cordlock removeable, but why be a Nancy? Worked ok to keep the sun off here in the Mojave Desert, no rain to test that function. Relaxing a few moments in the shade, well worth  the effort! Probably not worth much in a wind storm."
4.0,"These are very cute, but they're much too wide for my baby girl's feet. Granted, she has skinny narrow feet like her father, but I feel that even an adorable chubby foot would have a lot of extra room. My girl is clumsily walking, but doesn't seem to have a problem doing what she can in these shoes (when I cinch the velcro to its max)."
4.0,fits perfect and my daughter loves them.
4.0,"My sister's wedding dress has lace and sparkle all over, this necklace was simple and elegant enough to compliment the dress without being too busy."
4.0,fit a little smaller than expected but was very cute
4.0,The petticoat didn‚Äôt come with it. I‚Äôm petite and thin and the small is a little big I need to alter it. The length will need to be altered it too it‚Äôs longer than I expected. The material is good! I got it to wear to Disneyland with my Minnie Mouse ears!
4.0,LOVE it!!  Definitely up size it ordered an XL & it fits like a medium!
4.0,"Bought this as a bridesmaid dress for my friend's wedding as she didn't particularly care what we wore provided it was grey, and I didn't really feel like spending $175 on a dress at David's Bridal that I'm probably not going to wear again. I wish it came in black, I have another wedding in a couple months that I need a long black dress for.<br /><br />Fit beautifully...the only problem was there was a small hole on the seam of the skirt which the bride discovered when judging if she could dye the dress black for me after the wedding (womp womp, wrong fabric for that.) She's a sewing wonder woman and obviously had a sewing kit in case we had any mishaps, and had the hole mended in 5 minutes.<br /><br />If you're any shorter than 5'7&#34; you may need to hem it or wear decent heels. I had low-ish heels on and am 5'7 and a half. It was floor length on me."
4.0,"just not enough room, I thought it was a bit larger"
4.0,"not super great quality, but they‚Äôre ok!!"
4.0,"Recommend replacing the cords with elastic bands, it's a bit hilarious trying to keep this thing on and adjust it at the same time. Doesn't have the mesh like in the picture of the model wearing it."
4.0,"I love the fit of this dress. It is so flattering. The color is beautiful as well. The fabric is so soft and the perfect weight. It doesn't blow up in the wind and I feel well-protected, yet it is breathable and feels lightweight when I'm wearing it. I could see myself wearing this to a wedding with black, closed-toe pumps, to a company picnic with wedge sandals or on a field trip/playdate with white sneakers. So versatile and fun."
4.0,"Sent it back, it was too small. But the quality was there.  Just did not have my size."
4.0,My son loved it. Unfortunately it was too small.
4.0,Looks good but its small.
4.0,"This is the first cosplay I have ever ordered and I love it!! The dress is exactly as pictured,and despite how dusty the packing was, the dress was only wrinkled and not dirty. I was really nervous about the size (especially around the bust) but besides being a little long it fits me perfect!! I am 5 feet tall, weigh 139 pounds, and I am a 34 D. The only reason I gave it only four stars was because there are some fraying around the ruffles at the bottom. It's an easy fix, but I would rather not have to fix it."
4.0,"Buy!!! It‚Äôs genuine, it‚Äôs real!! It‚Äôs freaking beautiful!! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on my necklace and I feel like the meaning behind it if you know what this heal rock does, I feel like it works, like I know it works! Thank you!!!only problem is the necklace it came with would‚Äôve been perfect but it‚Äôs supposed to sit between the two beads and unfortunately the loop on top of the rock isn‚Äôt big enough to go over the bead. I would suggest putting smaller beads or a tad bit bigger loop for the top of the rock where the pendant is supposed to go through. Also the wrap around the rock is cheap and bent."
4.0,Earrings as described. Would have given 5 stars but earrings came in small little plastic bags instead of a box.
4.0,Wish they would cup the crotch a bit more but otherwise great. I will probably buy again
4.0,well received
4.0,"Nice shirt, runs small."
4.0,"I never gave any thought to needing an RFID wallet until my credit card company sent me a new card with a chip in it, and my husband mentioned getting one for his passport.  I had previously carried most of my credit cards and driver's license in my checkbook, but kept my most-used card and debit card in my change purse; between the two, they took up a lot of space in my purse.  So, I decided to look around on Amazon to see what I could find that could accommodate all of my stuff in one wallet.  I decided on this one because it looked like I could fit just about all my stuff in it, and I liked the way it looked.  The price was also a factor.  Overall, this wallet seems well made, except maybe the zippers, which could be a bit better.  As others have mentioned, the credit card slots are a bit tight, but not a major problem for me.  It has 8 card slots (4 on each side), a zippered change pocket in the middle, and a pocket on both sides behind the card slots.  The pockets are a tight fit, and I only put things I don't need very often in there (business and insurance cards, etc).  It does not have a window slot for a drivers license, which isn't really a big deal for me, but I know a lot of other people want that feature.  There also isn't a designated place for a checkbook, which I would have liked; however, I tend to only carry a few checks and the register with me, as I don't write many checks, and that will fit in the wallet.  I can't rate the effectiveness of RFID protection as I have no way to test it, or long-term quality since I've only had it a couple of weeks.  In general, I am happy with my purchase.  It fits everything I need to carry and takes up less space in my purse than the separate checkbook and change  purse I was using before, and the price was decent."
4.0,Awesome warm socks in great colors!
4.0,"I was a little surprised that they fit larger than expected after reading reviews.  The belt helps keep them up and fit nicely.  The fabric was heaver than I expected, but very fun to wear.  These pants of very long.  I had to have them hemmed about 2&#34;.  I am 5'5&#34; with a 31 inseam.  overall a nice pair of pants.  4 stars because of how long they are and my needing to pay extra to hem them."
4.0,"I like nice things, and this bag is definately nice.  Looks well constructed; zipper seems sturdy.  The interior has a small zippered slot in the lid...maybe to store your meds separately from larger items.  Lots of space in the main compartment for mouthwash, shaving cream, brush, razor, floss, etc.  The bag profile is low, so stowed items shouldn't shift around much.  My only beefs are:  I was hoping for the high price for such an item that it would be made in the USA -- not so; DomRepublic.  So, even though it's made of leather, the price is too high.  Since I like it and I'm preparing to travel overseas, I'm going to keep it regardless of the price.  My second beef is, the bag has a 5-year warranty, but the warranty does NOT cover damage resulting from NORMAL WEAR (emphasis is mine).  Does this company expect the owner to keep this bag in a drawer for five years and not use it?  Oh well, as with most of the warranty cards that come with products I buy, I toss them in the garbage to prevent future aggravation.  Bottom line:  the bag is nice and functional, but there are probably just-as-good bags on the market for a lower price.  I know I'll enjoy it.  If something bad happens to this bag during my overseas trip, I'll provide an update."
4.0,The size chart is wrong and the fit is to tight
4.0,I love the fit and look of this band.  It is nice leather and well made as well.
4.0,these are super cute! actually slightly bigger than I expected which was nice. the paint job for the mushroom spots is a little messy but from afar not a huge deal.
4.0,Okay so this jewlery is nice quality but the part that is advertised as an opal is just more of like glass with confetti under it. It's really pretty and you really can't tell that it's not from the normal length people will be looking at it from but I was kinda sad by it. Still like it and will wear it but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting I guess.
4.0,"I like thin gaiters for the summer. It gets hot here, but sometimes I still need to protect my face. Sand blowing on the beach comes to mind. This one fits a bit tight on me (I‚Äôm a woman) but it‚Äôs very stretchy and easy to breathe through, and feels cooling, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as others I‚Äôve tried.<br /><br />I‚Äôm writing this during the pandemic and I do wear a mask when I‚Äôm out. I don‚Äôt think this offers adequate protection from viruses. Too much air freely passes through it, but I think you could attach a piece of something behind it to make it better. I know a lot of people who don‚Äôt want to wear a mask, but do it to avoid confrontation issues. Please understand, I‚Äôm NOT suggesting you disobey any local mandates or take inappropriate risks. But it‚Äôs easy to breathe and talk through, and I suppose anything is better than nothing."
4.0,I like the dress just didn't fit me how I<br />I would have like it to.
4.0,I love the strap it is very good believe me it's also comfortable and the pick holders rock that is made on the strap ... reason why I only placed four stars is because I only got 2 picks instead of 3 ... but other wise it is very good  product wonderful to have
4.0,"Although it looks like the picture, I was expecting it to be lighter weight.  It looks nice, but I won't wear it because I don't like heavy earrings.  They aren't terribly heavy, but they aren't as light as they could be.  The finish is nice, and the quality appears to be fine.  The necklace has an adjustable chain for about 2 inches, so you can make it the perfect length.  It has more of a rose-gold finish than just pink."
4.0,Nice study material...a little hot for warmer days...love the pockets and waistband though.  Only thing I don't like it they are shorter than I would like.
4.0,The bottom part should be a little bigger. For reference I'm 139 lbs 5'5'' and I bought a Medium.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for- very comfortable and great support.
4.0,"Lovely, good looking garment but the XL was much bigger than what I expected.<br />Seller shipped quickly and the garment is very nice."
4.0,"it's super cute, just as the picture shown! Only problem is that it's too big for me, though it worked out well after i did some alterations! :) I'm 5'2 tall and weigh 92 pounds FYI."
4.0,Great quality fits like supposed to and shipping was quick I ordered this shirt for my husband to wear to our son's wedding he is a guy with really Broad shoulders and chest and one that does not like to wear ties so bought this as an alternative dress shirt to wear with a vest he ended up wearing it by itself and said it was really comfortable however I did not realize that it had such large pockets and pocket flaps on the front as I could not see them in the picture but otherwise was very satisfied with the product would definitely order other items from the cellar
4.0,Beautifully timbled stones great color
4.0,"Fun earrings for healthcare workers but no earring backs so, earrings might fall off & be lost.."
4.0,Comfy butt panties ‚úåüèª
4.0,"its alright, i used them a few times when going to sleep due to a noisy room lol, wasn't the most comfortable but sleeping in them isn't their purpose. besides that, if you arent wearing them for super long they're comfortable. the noise cancelation is eh, i'd expect more. it muffles things more over cancels the sounds"
4.0,"the jacket fits alright, the button on the right sleeve came off after about a year but non of the others have yet. the jacket itself is still in great condition and is very warm."
4.0,Wonderful little vest. Beautifully made. Even more beautiful in person. The material is very soft. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the fit is kind of small. I have a toddler ( 2 years 7 months ) that is just a tad bit tall for her age (94 cm) and this vest already looks a little sort so there won't be any room for growing.I order a 3T.  I liked this vest soooo much that I'll probably buy the next size up and pass this one on to her little sister.
4.0,"You have to get the top about 2-3 sizes bigger than normal. But, knowing that, this top is comfortable and kinda sexy. I've purchased twice now."
4.0,"Soft.. cute, fits a big array of sizes. Great price."
4.0,"This toiletry bag seems nice for the price. They say it is ""100% genuine soft, hard-wearing water buffalo leather"" on the product listing, but I can't see anywhere on the actual item (such as on a tag inside the bag) where it says anything about what material it is. I am not a leather expert, but my observations about the leather on this bag are that it feels a little plastic-y, but looks nice. I've never had something that I'm aware of that was made of water buffalo leather so maybe the plastic-y feeling is normal.<br /><br />The bag has 2 large compartments accessible via a pretty wide opening, so it should be easy to get stuff in and out. There's also 2 smaller zippered compartments: 1 on the outside of the bag, 1 on the inside of one of the larger compartments. These offer a good amount of organization.<br /><br />The bag has some structure to it, not sure what the material is, but it feels like between the leather and the lining of the bag is some kind of thin stiff material to help it keep structure.<br /><br />This is a nice toiletry bag for the price. I don't get the sense that it is luxurious beyond its price point, but for what I was looking for will get the job done."
4.0,This is a gift so don't know if fit is correct or how it holds up.
4.0,This product was a great value... I usually get these type of sandals every 2 years at Kohl's but I was late this year and they were out of season.  The only small drawback is that you need to break them in for a couple of days before they feel<br />right and don't bind or pinch.
4.0,"I was surprised at how purple the pattern is. My screen on both phone and PC show blue and grey pattern. This is definitely purple and a greenish grey on a dark background. Far from being ugly, it's a nice tie. Just not what I thought I was ordering, thus the 4 stars."
4.0,"The dress is made of a cheaper material, which I expected so that's fine. BUT I am super short so this went past my knees and looked really weird on me."
4.0,its a little tight around the head area but overall it's a good hoodie
4.0,"Much thinner than expected, so will definitely have to wear something under it. O.o It's very stretchy and fun though."
4.0,This pair of legging lifted my butt but was quite unflattering for my thighs and calves. It really magnified the fat around my thighs.
4.0,I really like the way that this dress fits but was not a fan of the bows on the shoulders at all. Made them look weirdly bulky and so that I could not wear a jacket with. They are held on real simply though (literally one stich on each corner of the bow and two in the middle) so they were simple enough to remove without damaging the dress. I would buy again in other colors based on the fit and remove the bows.
4.0,"This is a nice, masculine necklace. It comes with an aged silver anchor on a brown leather cord. The cord is soft while still being rugged. The cord is also completely adjustable with slide knots. The anchor itself is a very solid substantial charm that has a good bit of detail on it. The only one drawback to this necklace, for me, is that the bead between the top of the anchor and the cord is not fixed in place. It moves a bit when you move so the anchor gets crooked. I have thought about tying a knot to keep it in place and I may do that in the future. It's a good statement piece and a bit larger than I anticipated. Make sure to pay attention to the size in the listing. Overall, I like this necklace and I hope that my husband likes it for Christmas as well! I received this at a discount in exchange for my completely honest review."
4.0,Love the fit and the material.  It is a good purchase and YES will recommend to everybody.
4.0,"It's so pretty, came on time and I think my sister will love this ‚ù§"
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 130 lbs. Ordered a large and it fits well. But the shorts arrived in a box, when a bag would have been better and less wasteful."
4.0,"I bought this heated vest as a gift, however I first wanted to test it out first for myself.  What impressed me the most was how thick the vest is, how soft the lining is, and how quickly it all heats up. The power/setting button is very responsive, and the colors to indicate the temperature settings are pretty. The wire to connect the battery also is very conveniently located.  There are a couple opportunities for improvement - The sizing runs small. I generally wear Large; but this XL was very snug on me. I‚Äôm also of average height, and the vest barely reaches down to my waistline. I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre 6‚Äô or taller this will not reach your waistline. Also, The battery pocket is an exterior pocket; not interior. I feel like the battery would be better protected from the elements if there was an interior pocket. Speaking of pockets‚Ä¶ Make sure your battery isn‚Äôt bigger than 4‚Äù tall x 3‚Äù wide; otherwise you will not be able to snap the pocket closed around the battery.  With all of this being said, if you are of medium build and have a small to medium sized battery, this vest will be absolute perfection for you!"
4.0,I like that it's all cotton. Feels very nice to wear.  You will need to order one size larger if you have anything more than a B cup.  And this shirt shrinks at the first washing so you will need to order another size up just for that. The waist line is not fitted at all so it kind of boxy.  it'd be great if they tapered it a bit at the waistline.
4.0,"It came with a funky smell, but that went away after a couple weeks of daily use. Other than the smell, I love it! It's a good medium size and can fit more than it looks."
4.0,Cute and super soft. Live the color. Sadly I had to return it because it was too small but if it fit I would have kept it for sure.
4.0,"These are good for my 6 year old. You get what you pay for. They look and feel cheap. For the price, though, high quality is not to be expected. I would recommend for children or as part of a costume, but not for an adult to wear every day."
4.0,Great product the only issue I have is that the cut out for the charging cord is not wide enough to accommodate the charger had to cut the case so the charging cord would fit properly
4.0,These long John's are quite nice. They fit snugly but are not restrictive. They are warm but not too warm. I live in Florida and bought them for a trip to Chicago in January. They worked well although I may have preferred something a little warmer in retrospect. I guess my blood has thinned a lot more from the Florida heat!
4.0,Fits oversized just like I wanted.  Less of a sweatshirt and more like a heavier weight long sleeve tee.  It‚Äôll be good for layering and is very cute.  I haven‚Äôt washed it yet so I‚Äôm not sure if it will shrink or not.  I hope not.
4.0,This watch did not cost very much but it looks like a more expensive timepiece.  I have received many compliments on it since I have started wearing it.
4.0,"Great glasses. As someone who owns a formatable collection of glasses, I can tell you these are nice from the short amount of time I wore them. However, they are a bit bigger than I wanted. They will be fine for James Potter, but I still wish they could have been just a few centimeters smaller in diameter."
4.0,Nice but a bit small and stiff for my taste.
4.0,I love the look but the sides are too thick and tighy
4.0,"Nice earrings.  Backs are a little loose, but they were easily fixed with pliers.  Have worn them constantly for 3 weeks and they look great."
4.0,comfy top. I got lots of compliments on it.
4.0,"I LOVE the dress and will still keep it and wear it however I‚Äôm a true XL, wear size 12-14 in jeans. Hourglass shape. The dress is tight in the biceps/shoulder area as well as the bust. Not too bad but more than expected. I also will have to 100% wear nude underwear because it‚Äôs pretty see through standing in front of the mirror so I can only imagine if I was ‚Äúwalking on sunshine, oooo‚Äù"
4.0,Nice mask but quite thin. Will be great for warm weather riding.
4.0,I love this shirt! It's got the moveable room I wanted but doesn't look frumpy
4.0,"Love the print! The cloth itself after washing not only shrunk but faded. It also started to have fraying. I wash m masks by hand and lay them the dry, wish it would last longer..."
4.0,"Very cute, wasn‚Äôt as flattering as I‚Äôd hoped for but I still think it‚Äôs a super cute top! I got a little confident and bought a Large instead of my normal XL size because everyone was saying it‚Äôs so flowy, I think I would have felt more confident in an XL, but thankfully the L still fits me pretty good. But I would say this is TRUE to size! Size reference I‚Äôm 5foot 200lbs"
4.0,"Nice lined hat, but the berber lining makes it small and tight.  Good for 8-10 year old."
4.0,"So comfortable...but...  these are more like a big flare instead of a boot cut, and someone said they were tight fitting, so I ordered a size up.  Nope.  My regular size would probably been perfect.  I‚Äôm keeping them because they are so comfortable but my sewing machine will be coming out to size them down and remove some of the flared leg."
4.0,Muy √∫til con algunos detalles a mejorar.<br /><br />Buen material. Bonita presentaci√≥n. √ötil sujetador externo. El sujetador interior se despega muy f√°cilmente. El espacio interior es muy reducido. Con pocas llaves ya da trabajo de cerrar.
4.0,Really like them be replaced ear hook with sterling silver ones due my metal allergy.
4.0,Perfect size holds my my phone with my life proof case
4.0,I love it. It matches my space pants and shirt perfectly. The hood feels kind of awkward though.
4.0,Very good but can end up with sweaty feet.
4.0,üñíüñí
4.0,"this is adorable.  fits perfect ""true to size"" and extremely comfortable.  I buy alot of clothes on line and this is one I'll purchase more of."
4.0,"Quality was as expected. The pieces come folded, so there's a little bit of a crease, but it doesn't affect the ability to wear"
4.0,My mother loves it. She took mine and I had to buy me another. It goes with just abut any type of clothing.
4.0,"Fit is as expected. Material is soft, but a bit thin; bra may show a bit if the color is too light."
4.0,"Shoes looks nice and outside of shoe is not showing wear.  However after 1 month, inside of shoe fabric is wearing and tattered under foot."
4.0,"My only complaint is that they don‚Äôt stay in place when working out. When doing HIIT or running, they fall down and gave me a diaper butt lol. They are squat proof, super soft, no camel toes, etc. just didn‚Äôt stay up. I‚Äôm a size 4-6 in jeans, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 155lbs And I ordered a medium"
4.0,Description should say they run small.  will have to give as a gift.
4.0,"..I'm sure I'll get used to it but the pants are just great so as I said I'll get used to it. Nice pants they are tight but not uncomfortable. Like the inserts behind the knees, I can feel the air moving around and feel cooler lol I do though. They wash and dry so nicely-I'm very pleased with them!"
4.0,I ordered a size up after reading the reviews. I'm a size large but ordered xl and it fits well.Sleeves are a little short but I'm tall and I have long arms. That's not a problem because it has buttons where you can wear them cuffed up as well. Not bad for the price.
4.0,"Good heavy cotton socks at a good price, unfortunately not like the last ones I got which were made in U.S, and made for people with larger ankles. I have edema and need socks that do not constrict my ankles, very difficult to find suitable socks."
4.0,"I gave this 4 stars because although it wasn't for me and I returned it, it was  really a matter of personal preference. I misjudged the sizing."
4.0,"It's beautiful but they are not all cut the same. I ordered so many of these for myself and my sister in different colors and its hit or miss on the same size and the aprons aren't always matched up right to the dresses-sometimes you get the right one, the satin of the apron ends at the sides of the dress, sometimes it is too small and does not end where it should and looks ridiculous. But they are all beautiful, good quality, formal dirndls."
4.0,"It is super cute. I kept it. It fit very well but I could see that if you were bustier, it would be difficult to button them."
4.0,I had to rotate the Angel because the snaps were opposite. Worked well.
4.0,I will be holding onto this until my grand-daughter in old enough to wear. It is very cute though. I think young girls will like this.
4.0,I really like the vest! It fits great and it goes with a lot of the outfits that I've put together. The only thing I don't like is that the buttons are a little loose.
4.0,nice quality but runs small
4.0,They are comfortable to workout in
4.0,The hat was of good quality.  Just not the style I was looking for.  I wish the brim was a 2 inch brim.
4.0,"As I've bought this exact shirt in a different color previously, I was expecting the same fabric, but this was very thin.It's a great fit and the color is accurate, but I've deducted 1 star for the thin fabric."
4.0,"Product fits great, looks lovely on my fianc√©, but she says the stitching is itchy. I looked and sure enough, everything that you see stitched in white is quite pokey on the reverse side. I do not suggest this for people who have overly sensitive skin, but my girl likes how it looks, so she‚Äôs keeping it."
4.0,"I purchased this for my husband, he is 5'11 and weighs 200lbs. He is more built, has broad shoulders and we went with an XL and it was tight on him. We ended up returning the product because he had a hard time putting it on over his torso. Overall material was great and it's is a nicely made wetsuit, just needed to size up."
4.0,good jsut a little tight
4.0,Sooo cute. But the sizes run big!
4.0,"Nice top, wife wears it to work pretty often."
4.0,Took over 2 months to receive but it‚Äôs really cute!
4.0,Xlarge fit like 12-14 large 10-12 juniors size really pretty in person daughter wore it in navy blue
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty and fun.
4.0,They are very loose.
4.0,"Nice quality band for the price. The buckle is a bit large, though. Using it on an Orient Bambino 3 with 21mm lug width, it just fit. I trimmed a very small amount off of one side with an exacto knife so that it's easier to remove. Would buy Dassari again."
4.0,Nice but hard to find openings for ponytail.
4.0,"I'm 5ft and ordered a mediam because it's from China so I was sizing up BUT DONT. The dress is super cute but a bit long, I wanted to wear over the knee boots with it but then you don't see and leg and it looks weird. It comes to just above my knee :/ frustrating but I guess I'll make it work"
4.0,"PROS:  best design I've found -- not too big but not too small, wonderful zippered UFID pocket for credit cards and passport, plenty of pockets and zippers including front slip pocket, enough width to fit most daily essentials.<br />CONS: Only con I have relates to color descriptions.  I like ""red"" but ""Ruby"" which should be rich red was more Pink.  Bordeaux which should be ""dark red"" was ""Grape"".  I'll try again for ""Ocean""."
4.0,"Used for a teenage boy.  Heavy duty material and stitching.  Holding up great.  Bigger than expected.  After 3 months no construction problems.  Color fade a little.  Not a big deal,  getting used plenty."
4.0,I love this dress. I'm a size 10/12 and ordered the x-large and I like the fit. The white area of the fabric is slightly see through so when I will have to wear a long sweater over it. I wore it out to dinner last night and got lots of compliments. I would buy it again.
4.0,For the price this is a great watch. I have had many compliments on it. Many people have mistaken it for a much more expensive watch. I wear it daily to work so it gets treated pretty rough and has stood up to me so far.
4.0,"The sleeves were too short for my 14 month old. However, we will still be wearing them."
4.0,I ordered a large because I saw other reviews I'm a 34c bought 125pounds
4.0,Perfect Purple for Waldorf.
4.0,"I am a size 12, 5'9"" and 200 lbs. It isn't oversized. It is cute and would be cute on a thinner woman. But it doesn't even cover my front without me pulling on it all the time. I wish they sold an XXL, maybe it would fit better. Otherwise very cute"
4.0,Quick deliver and durable jersey material.  Had to get a larger size due to limited availability
4.0,"Very cute. Pretty good support for a C/D cup size. The size L/XL should fit 10/12. It should‚Äôve fit perfectly but man was it snug! I won‚Äôt show a picture only because I‚Äôm pretty self conscious. However I like the straps, it makes it a little more sexy. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so snug. I am usually a 36D (I would be more comfortable in a 36C 1/2 üòÇ). But it is uncomfortable in the 36 around area under breasts after awhile. The shoulder straps are fine though. It‚Äôs cute, but I would be worried to go up in size but it‚Äôs too snug to be in all day log without lines around your back."
4.0,A little on the big side but other than that they are verry pretty. I like the material:)
4.0,"The buttons are white and the material is yellow/cream color.  It fits, but is shorter than expected.  The blues of the butterflies and pheasants are beautiful!  Overall, I like the shirt."
4.0,"good belt for the price... only downfall is the buckle is a bit flimsy though.<br /><br />For the price, just go ahead and buy it..."
4.0,"Looks and feels great on. The only problem (and why I didn‚Äôt rate at 5 stars) is that the front fades REALLY FAST. As an FRC shirt, it works because my husband‚Äôs work requires FRC clothing. When shirts show fading, they are deemed no longer safe to wear because it appears the fabric may no longer have the same concentration of the FRC chemical. The light and dark blue, and green have been worn for about a month, have been washed twice....and all show signs of fading. Other than that, they are great shirts.<br /><br />Would love to hear back from seller on why these shirts fade so quickly."
4.0,Very comfortable. Speakers slip around a little.
4.0,"Very cute I wish it would have fit, the arms were too tight"
4.0,"My mum loved it ü•∞, it was a beautiful jewelry piece. I would give it 5 stars but I did have to restring it to make it longer. But that's on me for not knowing her size üòÇ"
4.0,The way it was pictured I thought it was a silver frame when it came I discovered it was gold.  OK but not what I seeking..
4.0,"Bought these for my baby‚Äôs first Disney trip (got postponed), but they‚Äôre super cute and feel like they would be super comfy! I bought 2 different sizes (just to be safe after reading reviews) and would also recommend to size up probably 2 sizes."
4.0,"The Design is taking some getting used-to. I like this brand, the heel height works well for me."
4.0,"I love the shirt, a friend got it for me. It is a little small, but I love it so much!"
4.0,Very cute! A little bit sheer though. I wish they were a bit more opaque.
4.0,"My niece loved these. If you are sensitive to metals these are not for you but if you can wear any metal without reactions these are super cute, quite long and so nice from prom or similar event."
4.0,"The two necklaces come in separate clear envelopes in the same box, so definitely suitable for gift wrapping. The chains are adjustable - the cubic zirconia choker has four loops, each about a half inch apart to adjust the charm from a choker to just below the collarbone. The gold bar necklace has five loops to adjust necklace length, and the bar dangles from a 3 inch (ish) chain. The two pieces can be worn together but also look nice separately. Either one is a charming choice when you're looking for a grace note instead of a statement necklace."
4.0,"Great sunglasses overall. The only drawback is it is very dark, which is not what I wanted but my Brother prefers that."
4.0,"Bought a 2 xl hoping for no tightness in the shoulders or as you cross your arms and there is plenty of room. I normal wear an XL. The arms however are a little short, there are tabs/snaps at the cuffs it looks to make tighter but not an option. Good is detachable so that‚Äôs a night feature. Allows for extra layers underneath if needed. Over all happy with the coat not sure if a 1x would have been good enough if the arms are already too short. Looking forward to seeing it holds up in a Chicago winter."
4.0,"We like this long sleeve onesie for under costumes on the ice. The only negative is that I thought it zips in the back but it goes over the head and the opening is very tight so if you have a performance and are doing your kid‚Äôs hair, put it on first, then style hair."
4.0,"I definitely love this dress and it's very flattering, but I didn't know it had pockets and they stick out in exactly the wrong place for me. I'm going to sew them shut. I'm 5'3&#34; and a muscular 150 lbs with 36C bra size and the medium is perfect."
4.0,Great design/colors and fabric. Lots of complements.
4.0,"Very cute but they bend a little too easily. Awesome product for the price, though."
4.0,looks good but fits small
4.0,Works for it's intended purpose. Now just if my little one would potty train lol
4.0,"I did like this suit when I got it, but as other reviews say, it was too short in the torso."
4.0,My son loves these pj's. They are soft and a very nice quality. They are snug...but that's typical for this style jammie. The pants fit more like tights rather than a looser or more baggy style pajama pant. If you don't want them to be snug I'd go a size up. I got the 4t and my son still wears some things in a 3t...but the 4t is definitely a snug fit.
4.0,"Love the watch - hate the strap...  Like almost all 'buckle-type' straps, it is very difficult to get a comfortable fit.  The watch is either flopping around on the wrist, or else cutting off the blood flow.  Also, the little hump on the end of the male part of the strap locks the strap against the holding 'hoop', making it extremely difficult to get the watch off.  Just this afternoon took the watch to my 'watch guy' and had the strap replaced with a Velcro band.  It was either that, or else return it, since I couldn't wear it with the supplied strap.  Works well on the Velcro strap.<br /><br />I obviously haven't been wearing the watch a lot, but I have played around with it quite a bit.  Found a place where I can put it where it keeps the charge up - took about 3 hours full sun to get the charge indicator from M to H - and also it detects the atomic signal.  During the Summer, I wear a watch all the time with short sleeves, so charging will not be an issue.  Just now, however, I am still wearing long sleeves, so the watch doesn't get sunshine all day.<br /><br />This is not a simple device, but the basic operations are fairly straight-forward.  I will need to sit down again with the manual, and play with the 'abc' functions, but I think I have everything else straight.<br /><br />What to say...?  I like a big, meaty watch, and that is definitely what this is.  If you have a slim wrist, this may be a bit overpowering...  Very easy to read in most lighting conditions.  I was a bit concerned that it looked a bit dark in the photos, but in the flesh it is fine.  The 'auto-lighting' function is a bit of a waste.  I thought it was a great idea, but almost every time you move your arm, the light comes on.  It would be nice if it would detect just a nice 'flick' of the wrist, but failing that, you need to push the button.  The light does work well, having done that.<br /><br />I have several watches, and my daily choice is going to be between this one, and my tritium-illuminated 'tactical' watch.  This is my first trek-style acquisition, and it is filling a nice slot in my collection."
4.0,"I chose these sunglasses because they were the most comfortable from a bunch of similarly sized and priced sunglasses.  These were a replacement for another pair I left on the train.<br />However, the Barricade did not hold up as well as expected. The frame broke around one lens after falling off a desk onto carpet. I was able to fix with superglue. Then the finish/outer plastic surface begin to peel off around the nose and arms/temples. Finally, one arm just came apart at the middle when taking them off one day.<br /><br />I got almost two seasons of use before they finally broke. I would wear them outside for 1-2 hours about 3 days a week during the summer and early fall. Some would say I got my money's worth, but my previous pair of glasses held up better over a similar time period and cost about the same."
4.0,The shirt came and looks and fits exactly like I expected it to.
4.0,"I bought this top on sale for under $10 and I‚Äôm astounded. I adore the cut and the sleeves and the triangular opening at the back. I bought the 2X and it‚Äôs literally a ‚Äújust right‚Äù fit. Like, if I was 6oz heavier, it would be too tight (I usually wear a id 1x with room to spare so she runs small).<br /><br />The material IS on the cheap side. Feels a little crunchy and paper like to the touch. I‚Äôve washed it twice and it‚Äôs starting to pill a little bit in spots. God forbid if it accidentally gets thrown in the dryer - I don‚Äôt think it will come out alive! But for the price I paid and how cute it looks on me‚Ä¶meh! It‚Äôs with it!"
4.0,"Love these, matches my skin tone and makes me look taller"
4.0,Nice an comfortable pants. Mostly use them on cold morning walks.
4.0,"I got these for my 16 yr old & he absolutely loves them.  He says they block the sun very well & they're so ""cool"" looking! Comes with a nice pouch,  soft cleaning cloth, strap & little, i think, screw driver key chain. The only reason I only gave 4 not 5 stars is because they're completely plastic & feel super cheap.  I feel like they'll easily break & get scratched. It's very flimsy material as well."
4.0,It's cool. Looks very nice on my wife.
4.0,"Nice hat, fits nicely, nice fabrik and size,"
4.0,"This is a comfy, soft, and cute dress. It's a little long, and I wish the material was a little sturdier, but overall good for a simple day-dress or lounging-around-the-house wear."
4.0,muy buena tela me encanto
4.0,"These glasses come with a nice soft case, but the glasses themselves don't feel like they will last a very long time.  I think that may be typical of this stye of metal glasses, though.  My daughter wanted a pair because they are in style now and I liked the price."
4.0,The first pair I received fit perfect but they were the wrong strength. Returning them was seamless and I received the correct strength but the frames were too big. I sized them using warm water but they are still big.
4.0,"4 out of 5 stars because they are stable for their price point and the design used, but within 2 months I had two holes in the toe area where my uneven gait tenders to cause extra pressure. Might be better if washed by hand. Great for summertime!"
4.0,Pretty cool little ring for the price.
4.0,It fits.<br />Does a good job insulating body heat..
4.0,Have not used it yet but do like the looks of the purse and seems to have plenty of space for all the junk I carry in my purse!
4.0,"Love the flowers. The reason I gave it four stars was that the clip wasn't covered like other clips for babies are. I don't want to hurt my kid, but other then that I feel that this will be used for a long time."
4.0,Grandson wanted to like them but they didnt fit very well.
4.0,"It fits small (I'm a 2X, and I bought 3X) and i wear it comfortably as an undershirt."
4.0,"I have no complaints.  4 out of the 40 did not work but considering that this is an inexpensive mass produced product, that is not too bad. Considering the price, I certainly received what I paid for.  We used these instead of candles in a celebration but I see these as cute party favors. Also would be handy anyplace you need a small flashlight. These are bright enough to illuminate your path or your door lock.  I think they would add to safety during Trick or Treat or other times a person is in the dark.  These are so inexpensive that I will reorder when I run out of them."
4.0,wife likes the color
4.0,Fits awesome for high impact workout and cycling.  It kept my girls in place.  4 stars because it looks a little weird under clothing.  I appreciate the two hook placements.
4.0,"Nice, a bit tight for me, but many compliments"
4.0,Loved it inspite of some things
4.0,"Had to order in a size too big for me because going up one size was $50 more, so having it altered a bit. Great for a tall woman (like me!) as usually the rompers are too short waisted and cut me in half, but because this is off the shoulder, it has some &#34;play&#34; so it works"
4.0,"They looke very cute but the magnet isn't as strong as i thought it would be. Its small and its only at the behind the lips of both. I thought the heart would also have a magnet.  But overall its a good purchase, very cute."
4.0,"I didn't buy these to wear outdoors or to do much walking in. They lack arch support for walking and the sole is too thin to protect against rocks. But as indoor slippers, they are great."
4.0,A bit less than expected
4.0,"Although the band is very nice, the clasp to open and shut the band is very tight. I had trouble opening the clasp."
4.0,"Good quality earing. Fits nice and are comfortable. Love that they are adjustable! The description of the product is exactly how they came. However, once I got them I thought there were too many feathers and actually cut some of the feathers off and I like them better without so many. Otherwise, love them!"
4.0,"I was very cute but it did run a little small and the area around butt was almost too big for it's length, which meant in moved around a lot and to put it simply, gave my daughter a wedgie and she was constantly picking it out lol"
4.0,I like these glasses except for the fact that they just didn't fit my face very well (no points deducted for that). I also felt like they were extra dark (which some people may like) and good if you're in intense sunlight but maybe not ideal for less light intense conditions.
4.0,Cleans shoes
4.0,"i thought the top was made of a different material so i was disappointed about that. however, happy with length and fit. love the pockets."
4.0,It looks pretty good.
4.0,Love the fit and feel of this cardigan!  Nice stretch and the added polyester ensure it will stay nicer longer.<br />LOVE!
4.0,"Very cute, but ruffles kind of rough"
4.0,"Full disclosure in that i have to wear shapewear in order for this skirt to look good.  The material is cheep and hugs every nook, cranny, and curve you have. There is no forgiveness. For the price it is what I expected though. It's pretty comfortable, and if you style it right it doesn't look as cheep as it is. It's also a pretty versatile piece in that you can make it look sophisticated or slutty depending on what you are going for."
4.0,Cute dress. Order a size up if you dont want it to cling to you. Hides a little bit of a belly. Love the cut.
4.0,"I really like it although it could use a metal clasp. The plastic clasp feels cheep. At first I didn't think I would like the money clip. After using it for a while I've found that I really like having my cash right there. All in all good wallet, would definitely buy again."
4.0,Using them for something other than swimming but they are nicely made.
4.0,My daughter said she remained warm during our winter vacation in Colorado. Good for layering. 4 stars bc I would have liked them to be heavier.
4.0,"Very short in the front. Not good with leggings but cute with jeans. Soft, comfy, flowy."
4.0,It was a small fit so I‚Äôd order a size or two up but it‚Äôs amazing other than that very comfy aside from the snugness
4.0,"I am a short person and was looking for a smaller, classy laptop bag that didn't glide along the ground when dangling from my hand. I don't like the look of a backpack for work at my age. It holds my 14&#34; lenovo laptop, wireless mouse, A/C adapter and 1/2 in folder but really bulges and cannot close when I add anything else. It might not be appropriate for my normal use; but since I've been using it daily for a couple months, it has remained sturdy and stays clean in our salt-ridden winters. Cloth handles, zippers, insert divider all high quality and well-made. I would definitely recommend. Thank you for designing a product for the smaller professional."
4.0,The socks are nice and tall. They say compression but I don't believe they are true compression socks.
4.0,Great quality but I wish the gloves wear removable and I wish the footie part had a tougher or thicker bottom in case is want to walk around in it outdoors.
4.0,"I am 5'4"", 140lbs and ordered a large.  It's too big.  The belt does not have beltloops in the back, so I spend the day trying to adjust it since it rides up constantly.  Other than that, they are cute and I get lots of compliments."
4.0,It's fine if you wear it under another shirt.
4.0,"The torso is too long, but I made it work. Overall, I do like it for the price I paid."
4.0,"Great for my son, fits true to size, shipped quickly!"
4.0,What a great product.
4.0,"These belts are a lot cuter in person than as pictured. They are 42&#34; in length and have 6 holes. They definitely seem to be more for fashion than function, but for the price I'll let them live out there short lives as long as they last.<br />The variety and colors you get are nice especially for the price.  It serves its purpose.  I didn't expect them to be some fancy belts, and they aren't, but overall they are nice.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a few different belts for different occassions."
4.0,"Saved package from purchase several years ago (walmart) and was glad I did, fits perfect with my current glasses."
4.0,"This is really cute.  I got it and washed it right away as there was a bit of a chemical smell - that was a true test.  It didn't seem to shrink (although I got it many sizes too large, I am always concerned things will shrink too much).  It is very cute and comfy.  I am happy with this purchase.  NOTE:  I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I got this and gave it to a friend and she liked it very much, although it's made with inexpensive materials so hopefully it'll last for a long time but only time will tell. The picture shows three keychains/charms but they send you only one, so that surprised me because I thought I was getting three at such a great price that I didn't mind the shipping price.  This keychain/charm is the kind you find in a corner store or gas station convenience store, it's not a high end looking keychain."
4.0,"They're good shirts, and I kept them as camisoles, but they do run a little small."
4.0,The chain is sort of short to be an anklet so I had to use as a bracelet. But still cute
4.0,Purchased for my wife. Color was perfect. Well made and fit perfectly. She really likes it.
4.0,Beautiful dress got many compliments. Would recommend sizing up. I wear a size 20 and got the 5x. Also the chest part runs a bit small. Overall a good dress.
4.0,This skirt is more like a tube dress than a skirt I'm 5'4 and it could basically be a dress
4.0,"The quality of the sweater isn't great, but good for seasonal wear.  I'm not sure how it would hold up in the wash, probably hand wash and air dry.  However, it fits as expected and is fun."
4.0,"The pants are very thin despite the fabric being merino wool. They fit well on the legs and are slightly loose on the waist. There are front and back pockets. The legs have stitches so as to make this pants seem more fashionable. They are mostly comfortable, although they pull at the knees where the stitches are located - they try to turn sideways a bit. They also show all the imperfections that my legs have. Unlike jeans that may conceal them, these show every curve my legs have. Husband says he liked me in them, but I am a bit more critical. They are not bad looking, just the look I have to get used to. They are not for cold weather."
4.0,"I like the bag, it is as described. I needed a bag of this size with easy access pockets. Unfortunately, the top zipper does not operate smoothly."
4.0,"These are cute and fairly well priced. The back keeps falling off however. Possibly my fault however, perhaps when I sleep it loosens on my pillow. Not sure. The cute little bag they came in was adorable. Might buy again, especially if it gets lost because back falls off."
4.0,While these are nice they are adult sized...does not fit my 5 year old at all.
4.0,So far so good! I like how easy these socks were  to put on. They fit nicely and feel very comfortable. Time will tell on their endurance and if I'll order again.
4.0,"East to use, but not strap to keep the foot covers to stay in your feet so they curl up or just dont stay down"
4.0,This thing is super warm and I love that it‚Äôs long! The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because I ordered a Large due to my height and arm length but the arm length is about 3‚Äù shorter than a normal size Large would be. It doesn‚Äôt cover your arms right. I wish the arm length was longer so it fit like a Large instead of like a Medium.
4.0,Cute! Cute! Cute!! My baby looks like a fashionista!
4.0,"Material is great the inside nice and warm fleece. Overall I love it except its a little too small. I‚Äôm 5,1‚Äù and 113 lbs. If you are much bigger then me I won‚Äôt recommend to buy this. Soon I took it out from the bag I was shocked! Lol, coz they looked so small. I‚Äôm was afraid it won‚Äôt it me but it did."
4.0,Cute but some had holes
4.0,Quality is good as well.
4.0,"Great seamless option very comfy, may give you the dreaded Barbie crotch üòÇ but definitely a great workout legging!"
4.0,The top was a bit loose but the bottoms fit and were so cute!!
4.0,"These facemasks are not only warm, but they are very comfortable, as well. I like how they fit underneath my hardhat and that I can pull them up and over my mouth or slide the bottom underneath my chin, depending on how warm/cold I am. My only complaint is that when I do have it pulled over my mouth and nose, they do tend to fog up my safety glasses - so, I just make it a point to pull them up over my mouth, but not my nose. I work in 40¬∞ temperatures, so covering my nose isn't essential. However, if that's important to you, be aware that they might fog up your safety glasses, too. Otherwise, I love them, appreciate them, and recommend them without hesitation; albeit with the caveat."
4.0,Too small on the legs it‚Äôs not very stretchy like comfortable jeans<br />but very nice Embroidery over all it‚Äôs good
4.0,"The dots are larger than i hoped, nickel sized. The tag, i believe  was misplaced. There is a seam right down the middle of one side of the dress, the other side with no seam was where the tag was. I removed it because i didnt want the center seam as the front of the dress. Both front and back of dress are the same. It is rayon, so buy larger than normal if you plan on throwing it in the dryer. It goes to my ankles. Im 5'4""It really is a beautiful, nice, dress."
4.0,"Loved this bracelet, but I only wore it for a few months before the silver turned green and the cross actually broke! It's cheap, so I'm not too upset, but its definitely not meant to be worn all the time."
4.0,Got them for a gift
4.0,But super cute
4.0,perfect size for my reading glasses; slightly less durable than expected
4.0,Great. Still fits after being washed .
4.0,"Fits like any other shirt. Not loose like it says. I am a 14/16 and I ordered an xl. It's not tight though (well a little snug around the boobs). Fabric is soft. I'm wearing a red bra underneath and you can't see through. Fabric is lightweight so good for hot days. Length is good. I'm 5'10"" and it doesn't show my muffin top when I raise my arm. Arm holes are about right. Not tight and no bra showing.<br />Colors look good. Stitching is not high quality (this coming from a sewing woman) but I expect should last the season. Not as bad as (major retailer here) bargain clothes."
4.0,these fit amazing and have great size pockets the material isnt see through is nice and thick
4.0,Nice color and quality for what I paid.
4.0,Fast delivery but the dress is too small. I need to find their return policy.
4.0,My 4 year old is tiny so it was a little big but so soft and  comfy. Just double tie it. She loves it.
4.0,The posts for the earrings are a little thicker than normal so it hurts after wearing for a prolonged period of time.
4.0,"I bought this to wear walking the beach (to carry car keys, money, drivers license, etc.).  The zippers were a little stiff and zipper pulls little to big."
4.0,"Honestly just what I expected. However, the zippers cling together pretty loud with any movement."
4.0,"Lovely and delicate; good quality. For me too small to be seen with my hair most days, but when I pull it back they are perfect!"
4.0,They are bigger than i expected. Kinda heavy.
4.0,It's nice. Good size
4.0,"Its really pretty, the sleeves are nice and flexible but the sleeves are also long. And the stings are not in the middle of the corset like most. You definitely need two people get this on."
4.0,"I ordered this as a gift.  The top is just as brightly colored as in the photo here, and the PJ pants look better in person.  Looks like good quality."
4.0,If fits perfectly  stretching. Comfortable.
4.0,Good experience.
4.0,"Cute, a little smaller than I  expected. But over all very nice earrings, good quality."
4.0,These are very light weight. They breath well but are some synthetic material so feel a little warm. They are very streachy too.
4.0,"As soon I received them, I put them on and can't stop wearing them! Northeast has been so cold but I wear them out sockless and my feet are toasty warm. This is my second pair of Bogan boots and I love them. Price is great too!!!"
4.0,"The dress was nice and was exactly as advertised. It showed up quickly as well. However, I returned it do not liking the style on myself."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a cute dress. I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the quality. It would look good in pictures, but if someone stands closely they would know it‚Äôs a cheap dress. I returned it."
4.0,Toasty toasty warm! If they laundry as well the will be super value!
4.0,The shirt is really pretty and very opaque. In the pictures I'm wearing black underneath and you can't tell at all. I would love this shirt except it fits too small across the bust. I ordered an XL. I am 5'7&#34; I weigh 156lbs I am a 36D in a motherhood nursing bra anyway. The seller was great to work with. I could not return the product but they gave me a two dollar refund and I kept the shirt. I thought that was nice. I'm hoping when I'm done breastfeeding it might fit so I've hung in the back of my closet. I would recommend this shirt. It's very pretty and flows away from the tummy area. It will tend to be staticky though.
4.0,Fits eell
4.0,Haven't worn the dress yet so can't say what to like or dislike. Plan to wear it to a wedding in October.
4.0,Very pretty and elegant. Wore to a roaring 20s party and got tons of compliments
4.0,"Warm gloves.  Size is kinda funky.  I got large, couldn't go smaller, but fingers do not go all the way to ends, so makes it hard to use a phone or do much, but definitely very warm which is what I wanted more than anything."
4.0,"Other than its too tight to wrap around my wrist 4 times, I love it. 3 times is far too loose. so its for ppl with very small wrist or very large wrist. I cant wear it around my neck against my skin, it pulls the hell outta any fine hairs."
4.0,"I really loved this and it looks great on.  4 stars instead of five since it is very stretchy and was too big and the fabric itself is a bit itchy, Hubby loved it though :)"
4.0,"Gorgeous color, but not good for petite frame. Armholes/shoulders and overall cut better suited to women with regular or tall frames."
4.0,"These sandals are excellent quality and fit great once you have the right size. I recommend going up .5 a size. I'm normally an 8.5 in shoes, but these were somewhat narrow and so I exchanged for the 9. They fit perfectly and the ankle strap is not too tight as I have found with others."
4.0,A GIFT FOR MY SISTER IN LAW WHICH SHE LOVED
4.0,"Flattering feminine flowy skirt.  I have this same skirt in green and brown as it is such a great classic look that is timeless.<br /><br />Material:  100% Polyester, woven, printed ,  recommended to hand wash, or dry clean.  This type of material will wrinkle easily so best hang dry and/or use a steamer as well.<br /><br />Style:  Fitted at waist with elastic waistband.  Fits high at waist around belly button.  Material is pleated so it sits nicely around your hips.  Looks best with top tucked in where you don‚Äôt have a lot of bunch of your top underneath as it will create bulk underneath the skirt.<br />Side pockets on the side are a bonus!<br /><br />Color:  the brown is a nice warm reddish brown with white polka dots.  Looks great with a white top and any color of booties or sandals... or some white sneakers.<br />Fit:  I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù 140lbs and ordered a small and it fits great.<br />Length falls at my shin.<br /><br />Low price which makes this a nice value."
4.0,"few lose threads, but great for price"
4.0,"Good color, true to picture (purple). Fits well: I ordered a Large and am 5'5&#34; 160 lbs, large busted.  The material is thin, maybe a bit too thin for a dress alone. I purchased it as a layering piece for the fall to wear with leggings and a cardigan. Perfect for that. Love the pockets!!  I have not washed it yet, but will most likely wash on delicate and not put in the dryer."
4.0,"The skirt is really well-made. I love the pockets, and I love the elastic waist (I found the zipper to be superfluous but a nice detail). I would have given it five stars, except that it‚Äôs not as breathable as I would like. I knew going in that it was polyester, but I . bought this skirt regardless because it was the only one that I saw that was tagged as machine  washable, Having said that, I do own things that are polyester yet feel softer and drape better than this. For reference, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 113 pounds. I typically wear a size 2 in pants. The small fit perfectly. I have kind of a short torso, so even though this skirt me look a bit stumpy, I‚Äôm keeping it because it‚Äôs so comfortable."
4.0,Nice watch looked very nice for a couple mouths then the color started to come off but still looks nice.
4.0,"Looks great,  and as described."
4.0,"Shoes were great, but fit too large. However at the rate kids feet grow, we will keep them and make them work"
4.0,"These feel kind of cheaply made but they look so cute and fit my face perfectly. Bonus that they come with a case, microfiber cloth, and repair kit. For the price, these are great."
4.0,"It does what it says in the description very well, which is to keep your warm, but this thing is rather hard to get on and off. The manufacturer should consider adding spandex to the construction of the product."
4.0,"I am a loyal Pandora customer.  Just about all my charms are Pandora.  I have been trying to put together a Russian themed bracelet for an upcoming vacation.  Unfortunately, Pandora does not have a Matryoshka dangle charm.  I do have a normal Matryoshka bead; however, I don't like the colors on it and it doesn't dangle. So I was very pleased to find a dangle charm by NinaQueen.  Of course, I had to get over putting a non-Pandora charm on my Pandora bracelet.<br /><br />While it is a nice charm, I do not feel that it is exactly able to be worn with Pandora products.  First of all, what annoys me the most is the size of the bail that the bracelet goes through.  It is &#34;much&#34; smaller that the normal bail prominence on a Pandora dangle charm. Please look at the picture and look at the fitting on the top of each dangle charm. You will see, for example, the fitting for the Russian Flag Heart is much more substantial that the fitting for the NinaQueen Matryoshka charm. These should be a nice match because they both have blue stripes...but not a perfect match. Secondly, the blues on the Russian Flag Heart are also not an exact match to the blue on the NinaQueen.  Finally, I would also have liked for the Matryoshka to be a little more &#34;round.&#34;  It is rather elongated.<br /><br />Are these things enough to keep me from wearing it?  No, because I really want another Russian-themed dangle on this bracelet.  Until Pandora comes up with another one, I will use this one.<br /><br />Update: NinaQueen sent me another charm as an example their craftsmanship.  It is a nice charm...rose gold color.  It is a normal bead...round.  It is larger than the round beads that I own of Pandora...although I believe Pandora has some oversized beads.  I think that if you incorporate a few of these beads into your bracelet, is would have a cohesive look.  Raised my three stars to four for the gift charm."
4.0,I enjoy the feel of the fabric.
4.0,"super cute! the top is a little big on me, and the padding in the top is also super stiff which isn't my favorite thing ever. but the bottoms are ADORABLE and really well made!"
4.0,A bit tight in chest for larger bust but beautiful chemise
4.0,"Beautiful purse, the only things I don‚Äôt like are that items occasionally fall out through the gap on top. I lost a new lip balm and my pen also fell out a couple of times. The other thing is the clasp can open inadvertently if it gets bumped, causing it to hang open unknowingly."
4.0,"this comes with two sets of pins to secure the strap to the watch.  they are much thinner than the garmin pins and have small levers to help install the pins onto the watch.  these straps have plastic pieces that go between the strap and the watch.  the strap is connected to the plastic and then the pins go through the plastic pieces to secure the strap to the watch.  i tried using these thinner pins (the garmin pins are too thick to fit through the plastic pieces)  and they worked fine, for a few weeks.  i don't know if the small levers got rubbed the wrong way when contacting my skin, or if it just wiggled loose, but a pin popped out and my watch came off my wrist.  luckily i was washing dishes at the time and the loose watch and pin landed in the sink.  i then clipped off the plastic pieces and threaded the original garmin pins directly through the elastic strap and it has been fine ever since.<br />this strap is much more comfortable than the original garmin strap and because it is soft and stretchy, it stays in place on my wrist no matter how sweaty my wrist gets or how much water gets on it.<br />the only other thing i have a problem with is the colors.  they do not match the pictures, but are much darker.  the orange is a brownish orange and the purple is a very dark purple.<br />i am keeping a close eye on these, and at the first sign of fraying or loosening of the stitching, i will be replacing them - probably with the same straps if they are still available on amazon."
4.0,"Normally a US size 14 is similar to a UK 13 and a EUR 48,5<br />But they fit like a US Size 15 or even more.<br />That's a shame really, as the boots look excellent and are well made.<br />I'm willing to sell my pair as i've hardly worn them."
4.0,"I love a skort  better than shorts, just a little more dressed up look. The large fit me perfect, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 140 pounds.  I wish the pants underneath were not white. If they were black I would give it five stars for sure.  This is the second  Ekouaer skort I purchased."
4.0,"Comfortable, but tend to ride up throughout the day so I have to adjust them once in a while."
4.0,"The earrings are to large and heavy, but good quality overall."
4.0,Really cute and comfy. The pants were a little tighter than expected for a medium so I took a star off.
4.0,"After reading other reviews and attempting to do it myself, I ultimately decided to get help from a jeweler to remove links. My advice would be to go to the mall with several jewelry stores around, because it may take a a few visits before finding someone who can resize a twist-o-flex band."
4.0,"This was a last-minute purchase for a daytime party, and I really like the color, stretchy fit, and flattering neckline + short sleeves. The dress does look fairly cheap in person (the print doesn't line up at seams), so it's not going to fool anyone, but it worked in a pinch, and it actually did look really nice in photos (paired with a necklace)! I bought three of these from various listings and this was the only one that fit well, so I recommend ordering a few before you decide. I may try another from this brand if I need another fast/cheap dress."
4.0,It looks great. I just wish it were made of better metal.
4.0,I was very please with this dress.
4.0,Super cute dress. Very flattering. I haven't wash it yet so not sure how it will hold after wash.
4.0,"Its a lovely lace dress at a very good price. Was pretty impressed with the quality, as it doesn't look cheap. The backless cut is very cute. I just felt that it was a bit smaller in size than expected, I usually wear small in all my clothes but bought a medium ( because I bought it last moment for a party and I wanted it to fit :P) and I am glad I did as it fit me very well and gave me a really flattering look too."
4.0,It's comfy and soft!<br />Didn't shrink after first was either.<br />Good buy.
4.0,I have a tall medium frame and this worked out great.
4.0,"I love this workout set.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 170lbs, athletic frame, long limbs.  I got a large.  It‚Äôs a little challenging to put on the pants but after they are on, they are very comfortable.  And they don‚Äôt skip down!!! The top may be intended for girls with a larger bust because it is very large.  Not the support I need for these B-cups. But still a cute set.  I highly recommend purchasing this workout set, just beware of the oversized spandex top."
4.0,"Returned, as I ended up not needing it, but a nice hat! Would recommend"
4.0,"I have been using these mesh bags as an alternative to ziplocs for stashing gear, both at home, car and in my hiking pack. They are preferable in pretty much every situation that you don't need a moisture barrier in place - they are more flexible, easier to get into and out of, and more durable than their counterparts while still allowing decent visibility of their contents.<br /><br />The drawcords and cord locks are a little wimpy, so I replaced them with para-cord and some heavier-duty cord-locks I purchased online. I would like to see some reinforcement in the area from which the cord emerges from the bag - there is no protection there against tearing, so I imagine it would fray with continued use. This isn't an issue for me, because I use these bags to store equipment and am not constantly opening and closing them.<br /><br />I would recommend something else, in terms of material durability and build, if this is something you intend to give, say, a high school kid to use for sports practice. However, for simply storing things for intermittent use, they are pretty much perfect."
4.0,Very sturdy and colorful
4.0,"Order a size up if you deal with a bigger booty. Thankfully, I did. (XL) This is super cute and fits well."
4.0,"So love the dress, but it was a bit big. I ordered a medium.  I am 5.7 and 170lbs. Real hippy and small on top. The material was great. Going to post pictures next time around."
4.0,"Fits great, easy to put on so my 3yo can be independent. They look solid and strong for rough and tumble. The price is great! I am considering getting more colors.<br />Its 4 üåü because  I am yet to see how long they last...<br /><br />Update: it's been 4 months of almost everyday wear. They held up great. The insole lining started to come off and Velcro started to weaken but shoe itself is still going strong.  I can probably get one more month out of them price for value is unbeatable!"
4.0,"I  like the fabric and the style.  Not the most well made top, however, a good value for the price."
4.0,"This one is kinda strange because the material on the inside is very different than what's in the outside. It's more fuzzy on the outside and the inner material is like your typical cotton hoodie. I'm not mad at it, it's just different than any other hoodie I've had. It was a little on the small side for me as well."
4.0,"Pants fit as described in the measurement chart. As a man on the short side (5‚Äô7‚Äù) I picked the US Med/tag XL (28-32). They are good pants, feel soft and are comfortable. I would have given these a 5 star but the right inside pocket was not sewn completely so small items would fall threw. A quality oversight apparently with this pant. Not a big deal as I will have that fixed myself and I don‚Äôt plan on keeping items in my pockets."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughters homecoming dance and it fit perfect.  I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't really like the way it tied up in the back,, only because the rest of the ribbon had nowhere to go and there was a lot leftover.  We had to tuck it into her underwear.  Overall, beautiful."
4.0,Was a little smaller than expected however still ver beautiful!!
4.0,"Didn‚Äôt know what to expect. This is my second time buying this kind of band,<br />others were definitely bad quality and seemed cheap. I was surprised to see that they looked better and seemed like they would hold up. Liked the I received 3 bands."
4.0,"Comfortable, well fitting, flattering, nice density of the fabrics. Best to wear with an under skirt as it is unlined and the seams can be felt on the inside."
4.0,"I had to make an extra hole to fit my wrist, but it looks good and was easy enough to replace my original band. I like that the color is so versatile."
4.0,My niece of 12 years old loved these for Chritmas!  The fit was good and the heel was just right.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a29c1e19304680b4ffe55d6aa7d0b03f]] I like the color, style and versatility of this blazer. It compliments my dark hair. This looks great in jeans. I‚Äôm petite at 5‚Äô2. It works on my short frame."
4.0,Comfortable well priced
4.0,Very pretty. Wire a little thin but I'm pleased with quality for the money
4.0,"runs small, but is exactly like the picture."
4.0,"I can only find anime shirts for adults in my local stores, was pleased that I could get child size."
4.0,"Not gonna lie, I bought it because I thought it was a brick red. When I received it, it was straight brown. Now, I don‚Äôt own anything this color, so it‚Äôll be a challenge, but that‚Äôs the point in fashion. So, challenge accepted! Material is nice and great quality."
4.0,"Love this item. The silver tone has that strong casual quality about it. But yet the garnet diamond looks beautiful.  Making it a very giftable item for any girl or women, as well as worth the investment."
4.0,"My dress was somewhat large due to me choosing the wrong size. I wear US large, but due to past experiences where I bought dresses one size larger and they did not fit I went for a XXL on this one. I like the style of the dress but really do not like the material it is made of."
4.0,"It fits good, but the glow in the dark doesn't work very well."
4.0,"I'm happy with the product.  But, it is very, very large.  You'll be warm but scary!"
4.0,"Super cute! Not as long as I expected it to be, but still, it's comfy and cute! This coming from a bigger busted gal :)"
4.0,"Normally a 36C and ordered a large. Was hoping to wear last few weeks of pregnancy but was too tight. Fits a little on the small side now postpartum, especially when breasts are fuller between feeds. Overall very happy with this bra and love the texture of the fabric."
4.0,I got a 18-24 months shoe my daughter wears a size 4 and these fit s little big probably should‚Äôve gotten a size 6-12 months. On the bottom of the shoe is says size 5..
4.0,"Love it. Super warm, stretchy, and cute."
4.0,"This off the shoulder top is really cute in my opinion. My 17 year old daughter, the intended recipient, didn't like it as much. However, once she put it on, she decided it was not that bad after all. One of the things that she didn't like, was the fabric. It's 100% polyester. She prefers really soft fabric, but doesn't realize that those are not always easy to care for. Once she discovers that polyester doesn't wrinkle, she may change her mind! She's 5'7"" and weighs about 150 pounds. The medium fit her well, though I would prefer if it was a little bit longer, but it was fine by her standards. The shirt is well made. The straps are securely fastened. It looks really cute on her."
4.0,Love this print but the black did seem to fade after the first wash. Still a cute top though.
4.0,"Super comfy. Glad it has a drawstring, WAY too big. Bought based on size chart. However, were great for recovering from abdominal surgery when I didn‚Äôt want anything touching my stomach."
4.0,"The Chains look amazing (5 star look), but the middle ring/metal circle that holds the middle chain to the rest of them keeps popping loose. It's rather annoying since the the middle chain dangles straight down when that happens, so I am probably going to replace that circle in the future. For the price this is an excellent purchase, and I would do it again. I received great positive feedback when I wore these chains.<br /><br />Bottom line: I recommend them. (When I looked through other public posts I found out that this weak ring was a common issue though, so just be aware that it will probably happen to you too eventually.)"
4.0,This was a great graduation bracelet product description was completely accurate and perfect for what I was looking for for the very cheap price I couldn't expect much more so I am satisfied
4.0,"They are lightweight, durable and cheap. I'm buying my second pair because I lost my first one. Also they are stylish. I used my last ones for about 2 years and I paid $28. Now they are only $20! I wear them every day for work, fishing, water sports and driving. In fact...I'm going to buy a couple more pairs because I know I will lose or damage mine with all use I give them.  I used to buy Bolle sunglasses for over $100.  I used to get scratches on them in no time at all.  I never got a single scratch on the Soxich ones.  Happy customer from Chico, California. ""Home of Sierra Nevada Beer Company"" Yay!"
4.0,Nice fit comfortable !
4.0,"I like color and fit.<br />The material is a little heavy, for summer."
4.0,"They were a little smaller than I was expecting, but they're super cute. Color is vibrant."
4.0,"I like these, not my 1st pair either. Im starting a trend and pretty soon I'll be making my own!"
4.0,"Cute little handbag, bought it for my grandaughter.  The pattern on it is what attracted me.  The bag should be perfect for her for everyday use.  The purse is well made and the material average strength.  So far I am pleased with it, and am sure my grandaughter will love it.<br /><br />The package arrived quickly and was packaged well, merchandise in perfect order."
4.0,Its great quality however WAY TOO SMALL. I would recommend sizing up like two sizes.
4.0,Very good for the price.  It could be a little tighter but worked as needed.
4.0,"The only reason it doesn‚Äôt get 5 stars is because there is some casting leftovers under the chrome when you look closely near the arrow tip. Otherwise heavy, solid keychain."
4.0,"I was preparing for the cold winter so I bought few pairs of these socks.<br />California normally doesn't get too cold and instead of buying furry shoes, I thought some<br />Socks could be enough carry me through and I was right.<br />They are loose but still stay in place, warm but not too heavy.  Overall I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Really love the print and the feel of the fabric. Wish it came with wrap instructions but I figured it out and hard to keep over shoulders for my size.
4.0,"I'm quite irritated that the glasses arrived with a huge, deep scratch in one of the lenses. They were also thrown in the envelope with a fabric sleeve for the glasses. It would have been a good idea to have the glasses shipped inside the fabric sleeve, but there's no way to know for sure how they got scratched. I would return them, but they are for my toddler to play with. They will inevitably be scratched up anyway.<br /><br />As far as quality, they are holding up incredibly well. My boy is pretty gentle for a toddler, but he's a young kid nonetheless. He broke a pair of drug store reading glasses in 5 seconds (literally). He has had these glasses for 6 days now and they are in the same condition as they arrived. They are really quite sturdy. I would say they are almost the same quality as my prescription glasses. The only thing that I would be concerned about are the metal parts for the nose cushions. They feel very flimsy and it felt like I was going to break them when I was adjusting them.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these if you were looking for a cheap pair of glasses. They also make a great decoy pair to keep your child from accidentally breaking your expensive prescription glasses. I deducted 1 star because I received a damaged pair and for the flimsy nose pieces."
4.0,Very Good for this price
4.0,very pretty. The color is as shown. The setting seems a little thin. That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. I will be wearing these frequently.
4.0,Bags were well packaged and are exactly as described. My mother loves this set and a great value for price. Bought for my mother and shoulder bag was just what she was looking for . She uses the large one for work. The small ones are great for going out and hanging out with friends. Very satisfied with purchase.
4.0,"It's very cute and makes finding my house key a breeze! My only issue is that the chain it comes with broke easily, and the hole in the cap is positioned so that getting it directly onto a key ring is difficult."
4.0,"Comfortable, have been looking for a support and comfort like this for a long time, reasonable price"
4.0,"Wouldn't quite fit my Casio watch, but made it work with a little cutting."
4.0,"Love this dress!  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because the waist in in kind of a weird place.... it's not high enough to be an empire waist, but a little too high for a natural waist.... BUT, it's still pretty.... with the right belt, it looks GREAT!  I adore the flowy skirt!!!  I am 5'6, about 147 lbs, and usually wear a 6-8 on top and 8-10 in bottoms, and the medium fits PERFECTLY.  As stated in the headline, there are two different hemlines offered in this dress.  I ordered the black and the maroon and their hemlines are straight and the skirt is extra flowy and I LOVE them both!  I also ordered the navy and the dark red and their hemlines are asymmetrical (I think?  They're different, anyway), the skirt is slightly shorter, and isn't quite as flowy.... still pretty, but I liked the other style better and couldn't keep them all, so I sent those two back.  Well worth the money! :)"
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful. I bought them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They‚Äôre a little bit bigger than what I was hoping, but I think she‚Äôll love them!"
4.0,Super cute but because of the metal I can't wear them every day.Overall super pleased!
4.0,"Lots of shade for a cheap umbrella. I do'nt expect it to last more than one season, but I may not last more than one more season.!!!"
4.0,The item is ok
4.0,"Cute top! Fits true to size. The bottom is more snug than the top which I don't love. I wish it was more loose and flowy. But still a nice top. Fabric is like a sports fabric/legging fabric that does a good job of keeping me cool. I like the criss-cross in the back, it's a cute feminine detail."
4.0,Good purchase wifey love it
4.0,Great clarity good product recieved as advertised
4.0,It‚Äôs very cute.
4.0,I ordered based on my actual shoe size but they fit too large to stay on in the pool. The slightest bit of motion or force in the pool pulls the shoes off by the heel. My advice? Order one size smaller than your actual shoe size.
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter's 18 inch dolls. She loves to play with them and they're perfect proportion. They are erasers, but she couldn't care less. Great for her imagination."
4.0,Perfect for travel!!
4.0,Exactly what I wanted so pretty
4.0,"Fair price. Decent belts with some problems. The belt metal is a crude rectangular design that can be bothersome at times by digging into the belly. Granted, I could lose weight and not have my (slightly) large belly protruding over my belt line but we're not superheroes.  Most of the time the belts are fine."
4.0,Nice dress and looks good with leggings
4.0,"The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a little too short for me.  I am 5' 7"" tall."
4.0,"not as bright as you might hope, but exceedingly cool and works very well... material not as soft as a silk tie, but it's an LED tie...."
4.0,"Love the necklace, a few of the stones were off center, but cant really tell unless you are seriously staring at it. Over all happy with purchase."
4.0,"Daughter loves them, they were for her. Wish they had size small, medium are a big medium but overall a good buy"
4.0,Got this for my grandson and he likes it.
4.0,"Esta bonito material bueno, impermeable, amplio me gusto todo exceso las mangas que se gastan la pega por lo dem√°s 9 de 10"
4.0,Very sparkly...love them comfortable to wear ..but size runs big.
4.0,"The coral colour is just what I needed. Just as the picture shows. One of the only option showing this exact colour but a bit pricey compared with bundles.<br />The fabric is thin but not as see-through. What I didn't like is that even when I have a small head, it could be tight when used the first time and after excercise.<br /><br />The white one is even tighter and the sewing is pretty bad."
4.0,Love this dress i would have ordered up tho
4.0,Look great. Lots of stretch.
4.0,"These are exactly what you would expect for the price. They look nice, but the backs are really flimsy and the metal tarnishes after a few months.  If you switch out the backs for something sturdier, these are a great neutral earring for daily use."
4.0,Was not firm enough.
4.0,Love this outfit very soft n comfy ..true to size mines a xlg .red was so vibrant n got so many compliments.
4.0,I like the bright color! Very nice but was hoping for a thicker material.
4.0,"Fit very well. But, it had a long run all the way down the leg. It looked like a pantyhose run. If it didn‚Äôt have that then I would of gave it 5 stars."
4.0,"A very nice dress, except it's not exactly white, and is quite sheer, so a slip will be needed underneath. Also do to the fact that I have a smaller waist, I will have to alter the waistline to fit. But other then that it will be lovely for our 75th Church Anniversary Function. Thank~you and I will order from you again. Also arrived in a timely manner."
4.0,"Since I make clothes, I must say this is cheaply made.  However, it can fit girls of most sizes.  It has elastics!  I ordered the size 14.  My daughter wears a 18.  She could still fit it, but it was tight!  The dress does look pretty on and will last."
4.0,"Really cute... 5'3&#34;, 120lbs - ordered a medium because I didn't want the top too tight. Looked okay out of the package but looked even better with some accessories - I paired it with a belt and a cardigan and the belt made it more flattering because it was a little wide in the waistline. As far as length, it drags a little on the floor with flats (great for a casual look) but skims the floor nicely with heels (more work/outing appropriate). The pockets are a plus, but make the dress a little boxy in the hips in my opinion (also remedied with a well placed wide belt)."
4.0,"The scarf is very well made and versatile.  The fabric is soft and not itchy.  The zipper could be a better quality.  Overall,  I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"I like that I can clip them on to my bag and not have to worry about them falling. They are vary thick. I have a large face so it works for my, and they are super dark, which is go at the beach or lake, but not for when you go sun to shade like on a trail."
4.0,This is a little larger than the other items of the same size that I've ordered. Otherwise good.
4.0,"It's super cute, but it didn't fit me how I would've liked. I always wear XS and prefer things to fit me snug but it didn't fit my waist and fell onto my hips, it just looked and felt too big."
4.0,"Nice quality, but tight for my 12year old"
4.0,Nice but shorter than shown
4.0,It works great under dresses
4.0,"So I love the feeling of this sweatshirt- looks like good quality, but was a little disappointed because it does run slightly small. Hoping when I wash it that it does not shrink! I‚Äôm probably going to reorder one size up because I do like the look of it."
4.0,"My OT recommended compression t- shirts for a medical condition.I tried this one bc it is made with 80% polyamide (nylon) & 20% spandex at a reasonable cost. I am 5'6"" & 140# and ordered my normal size (M). This shirt fits my core snuggly but is a looser in the arms (I have skinny arms.). I believe it will work well for my condition and will order another - maybe 2. Wish the wine color was available in M. If I were ordering for non-medical, I would order a L."
4.0,Lookers
4.0,Chain was too short n fit like a choker :/ definitely need to be longer chain
4.0,"Ordered as a gift and when it came in, it looked just as the pictures showed."
4.0,The feel of the fabric is awesome. Good for practice or under clothes for insulation in cold weather
4.0,"These are cute, nice colors, stretchy and comfortable.  I use them mostly at night when I'm sleeping to keep my hair from getting into &#34;snaggles&#34; and also throw one on if I'm cooking to keep my hair out of the way.  They do however, have a raw edge on them where they tied them off.  I read the previous reviews and looked for it when I opened the first one.  Don't pull on this or you will have a long, pretty string for your money.  Just open up the package and hit all of those ends with a quick shot from your hot glue gun and they'll be fine.  Believe me - you could not make these for $1.33 each because they have matching elastic on each one.  Not a bad idea to hit the edges of that elastic with the hot glue gun also.  I would be just fine without the &#34;made in China&#34; tag on the inside of each one."
4.0,4 Starr's because it's a pain in the ass to use the second row slots. Otherwise works as Intended.
4.0,"Very nice boots for the price. The fit and style and feel remind me of keins, just cheaper. They‚Äôre very comfortable  and the sizing is perfect. I like the looks as well. They hold up fairly well to real work, and overall I‚Äôm very happy with them"
4.0,"These are pretty and stylish sunglasses that will get you compliments when you wear them. I love that it is polarized too. Weird effect is that when you look at your phone while wearing these, it almost feels like you're wearing the 3D glasses. I have to take a star off for the heavy weight of the glasses. The nosepads helps but leaves a mark on your nose after about 30 minutes of wearing them. Not practical for long-term use."
4.0,"Excellent value, but they do run a little small.  Will probably work for most people with an average size foot, but I wear size 11 shoes and these are a little snug and short for me"
4.0,"Love the color, fits a little loose but looks good"
4.0,"Daughter loves the scarf. Gave it 4 stars because there is actually a hole in the product. Since the scarf's design already has holes, it was not an issue. However it is disappointing to get a new product and it have a defect."
4.0,I was really surprised. I initially chose this ring because it appeared to be of a moderate size. It is rather large but not gaudy. It very tasteful with a darkness & just the right amount of shine at the edges. Being steel it has considerable weight giving an impression of durability & sturdiness.
4.0,I love it!  Very very happy to receive it as promised as well.
4.0,"I just recieved these shorts in the mail ahead of schedule. They are comfortable and light weight. However, be aware that they do not have pockets. These shorts are good for the price. The only thing keeping this product from a five-star-rating is that the description doesnt tell you that the shorts don't have pockets. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,Slimming.  I wear a size 8. I got a size extra large and it fits perfectly. As I put it on the first couple of times I heard stitches popping?!  That seems to have stopped after wearing it for five times. It is a good value for the price.
4.0,"They're doing the job. They are comfortable once they're on, just wish they went on easier."
4.0,I‚Äôm a 36B and using the size chart I ordered a B. It was WAY too small. Almost comical. I used it but I was more like pasties than anything else. Other than the fit it sticks on well and doesn‚Äôt hurt taking it off. I‚Äôd prefer if it came in packaging that you could put it back in and not lose the adhesive. I used Saran Wrap.
4.0,Really confort
4.0,"Good clip. It isn‚Äôt as tight as it could be, if you put only 1 or 2 bills in it they will fall out but if you have a 4-5 bills it will stay in better."
4.0,"I like the band & the shade of blue. But I don‚Äôt understand why it has a second ring on the part of the band that holds the watch, it just adds unnecessary bulk. The 4 band pins that came with it are to short for the 24mm band I ordered, so I had to use the original band pins that my Surefire 2211 wrist light was using."
4.0,The dress was a bit tighter than expected but all in all an excellent buy. I would definitely recommend wearing shapewear or a thong underneath if you are a little on the thicker side such as myself.
4.0,I like it but it is not exactly as pictured. The break in the ring is actually at an angle. It is slightly adjustable but doesn't adjust as small as a size 3. One of my pinkie's is a 4 and one is a size 3. Nice quality for the price  and I'll be ordering more Chuvora jewelry.
4.0,Well made shirts like this are hard to find. I like button downs and I insist that the button portion be pleated.
4.0,"Although clear, phone didn't recognize finger touch"
4.0,I rated it &#34;like&#34; instead of &#34;love&#34; because there are only 2 hooks instead of 3. Nevertheless it is very functional and works as advertised.
4.0,"This is a very cute top! BUT... I read the reviews and ordered a size up than I normally wear and it is too big. I wear a US medium, but ordered a large and it fit like a large/x-large would on me. So, just order your normal size!!!"
4.0,I really love this cuff. It took almost a month to arrive but Im glad I ordered it. I would have liked getting several since they are very small and easy to lose.
4.0,"Tight, stretchy, great fabric! I‚Äôm a LuLu kinda girl and I think these are great. Inexpensive and fit just how I like. The fabric is a little see through for those who mind."
4.0,"I like these masks because they have a KN-95 filter as the inside layer, so one need not choose to wear a KN-95 disposable mask. Unfortunately, because these are cloth masks and they do not indicate the strength of the enclosed filter on the outside of the masks, others may think they do not have the filter at all. Also, these masks (medium size) are a little loose on the sides; that is, they do not cling to my cheeks. For these two reasons, I have recently switched to wearing the disposable KN-95 masks. It's too bad, since I like the colors this brand has, and they are quite comfortable."
4.0,"My daughter thought I was crazy for getting this for her, but when she finally wore it to her game she loved it.  Shipping is a little slow"
4.0,"it fits ok, I looks great but I will need to loose some weight before wearing it."
4.0,its a good product... just a little tighter on my feet than I expected.
4.0,Even though they looked cute they didn't have the arch support I needed so I had to return them
4.0,good quality. looks good so far. My kid likes it. Wish it has dual zip .
4.0,"This dress is a really simple but cute summer cover up.<br />Runs large so order a size or two down.<br />I'm 5'8&#34; and it stops a little above my knees. It's longer than I thought it would be but not too long by any means.<br />The material is that lightweight, springy, soft material. It shows a lot of creases (was very wrinkled right out of the bag) but in black the creases arent super obvious. The tassels are all bunched up (see pic - don't mind PJ pants underneath üòâ), thought they would be that shiny thin material but they look like regular cotton so they bunch up on the packaging ... Again, not a deal breaker bc I'm using it as a cover up.<br />Could be paired with a cute hat for a fun summer look! Overall, for under $20 I'm pleased and look forward to using it this summer!"
4.0,"These are beautiful, and we're great for the Edgar Allen Poe event I went to. However, I have sensitive ears, and the metal was not good for that."
4.0,"I use these for hunting and are warm, but I still have to wear another par on top."
4.0,"The dress looks good on me. It has a sheath underneath, so the only transparent part is the shoulders. There are threads poking here and there, and lace looks rather fragile in the edges, so one needs to be careful, it can snag easily. It's comfortable, soft and stretchy. The sizing is wrong though. I ordered XL for Mom, but I wear M and it fits me, it's only slightly loose. So for better comfort and fit I would suggest getting a size bigger. The sizing is smaller in this dress."
4.0,"I bought the 8-10 for my daughter who generally wears that size and the 4-6 for my daughter who is currently wearing that size. When I got the package the first leotard I got out looked like the size I would have purchased for my younger daughter...it fit her...but after checking the other leotard I realized it was actually the bigger one of the two.  I immediately notified Amazon and they quickly resolved the issue. The leotard are well made, they just run small."
4.0,Like them but should of stuck with the next smaller size.
4.0,Nice little bobble for Valentine's Day.  A good value for the money.  Was larger than expected.  About size of silver dollar.  I have no regrets in the purchase.
4.0,The arm opening is too wide and it shows the undergarments.
4.0,This is exactly what I needed. It is very large though.
4.0,These are great. Warm and comfortable. I only gave 4 stars because the thumb lining in one glove has a hole. The seem split. I didn't feel like sending them back because it's really too cold for me to wait for another pair.
4.0,These &#34;flexible&#34; glasses broke within the first hour my three year old had them. :( His five year old brother's had a much better outcome.
4.0,"I like them very much, great construction"
4.0,"I have side 12 feet, but still wearable and nice"
4.0,Super cute and true to color as pictured. My son started wearing these at about a year old and continues at 15 months. They stay on as well as can be expected with a toddler.
4.0,"I purchased the black one and received so many compliments. 2 things I didn't like. When I received it it was shrink wrapped into a 3 in little ball so when I opened it I thought &#34;HOW THE HECK DO I FLUFF IT OUT?!?!&#34; Second,  the clips don't make it easy to clip on your hair but I made it happen. Overall I rocked it and it was worth the price."
4.0,Nice cuff and tie clip but the tie clip are short. Good thing i have skinny ties
4.0,"great robe, medium thickness, fits exactly as expected. Ive had it for a year and it still looks brand new"
4.0,The first time wearing this today and I received 3 compliments
4.0,"Is very nice but I thought it was supposed to be tarnish free? After a few days of wear, the back of the necklace is turning black! Other than that it is one of my new favorites!"
4.0,Looooove this for my planner item storage but boy is this color a lint magnet. If you have any pets with hair this will be an everyday struggle.
4.0,I don't like socks but they're a wardrobe must. Mind as well be cute ones.
4.0,"I am 5ft8 and it came to the back of my knees and hit a nice spot on my thigh. I liked it, but it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for for my bachelorette party. I probably could have sized down"
4.0,Awesome.  Good weekend watch.
4.0,A little on the small side I ordered a size up because I like tank tops a little loose. I ordered a LG and it fits like a medium. If I reorder I‚Äôll be getting a XL
4.0,just got 2day can wait 2 c if they work
4.0,"This dress is a pretty color (got the purple).  I love the pockets.  I am 5'6&#34; and this is almost too short on me.  I wanted to wear it to work with a jacket and booties, but it might be pushing it for length.  It's great for a summer dress."
4.0,"Cons: Sleeves are snug on my heavy arms. Solid color knit fabric doesn‚Äôt camouflage my boobs.<br /><br />Pros: soft, comfortable (even with snug sleeves), looks pretty on me, just like pictures provided.  Works well with a beautiful floral robe I have.<br /><br />Happily keeping it."
4.0,"I've been wanting a Moissanite piece of jewelry for a while but the prices are usually too prohibitive for me. This little sparkler caught my eye because of the price and great reviews. It's very pretty, not overly showy and perfect to wear anytime. I wear to work and even the gym. Not too flashy, just understated cool. Love it!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1f7dbbb2f361f4b2b75c0352e540c171]]
4.0,It is a little bigger than I expected. I like the zipper section
4.0,"My grandaughter  loves the colors,  They were a little to small but she wears them anyway, refuses to give them up"
4.0,Beautiful bracelets but very small.
4.0,"This took a while to ship since it's from overseas, but if you have time to wait for a necklace, this is ornate and detailed, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. The chain is a bit longer than desired, but you can just clasp it lower if needed."
4.0,Nice hat. Good quality. A little shallow for my taste but I do have a rather large head.
4.0,"Not as small as I thought it would have been. But if you have heavy breast ( I'm a breast feeding mom, so I have nice, but heavy girls ) It does stretch with you, but it's not fitted for the nicer boobies. Mainly for the smaller cheasted ladys. But awesome for spring/summer backless peices."
4.0,nice earrings but not as thick as i wanted. i am keeping them for an extra pair and will order from this seller again!
4.0,I love the soft and stretchy( fabric and the side pocket. This stylish dress you can wear with hills or sandals.
4.0,"Cute shoe! I wear a size 7.5/8 and ordered the 7.5 and the length is great and fits like it should. My only complaint is wearing them for the first time today, the insole piece on the left shoe feels like it is moving around every time I take a step."
4.0,"This is my second favorite all around belts and my first choice for any pair of pants I'm wearing for some heavy work.<br /><br />First off you are not getting these buckles through your belt loops, not happening.  This means you have to unclamp one side of the buckle from the nylon belt and thread the nylon itself and re-adjust the length when you reattach it to the buckle, EVERY TIME you remove this belt from a pair of pants.<br /><br />That CON comes with a PRO.  Because of this, the adjustment is the most secure of any of the buckle types I've tried outside of the standard prong and hole belt style.  My favorite type of belt is the ratchet buckle but for some people it doesn't hold since it clamps onto the end tip and has to be cut to size.  This tactical buckle clamps onto the nylon belt as it loops and folds over itself holding it firm.  That looped material hides itself meaning this belt can fit a wide range of waists with no dangling belt tail.<br /><br />So not the fanciest or best looking.  Not the easiest to adjust. Great at holding it's adjustment.  One of the simpler buckles to open and reconnect.  Strong."
4.0,"Nice size, good neutral color, moved into it and seems just right to hold my everyday needs."
4.0,I love the way it looks but it is a little small
4.0,"Despite being a slightly tight fit (I'm tall and slender, not muscular), this is a thick, fleece-lined pullover shirt that only needs a t-shirt underneath and nothing over it in dry, mild weather.  The quality seems to be fine: good stitching, ribbing is perpendicular to the neck and arm seams, the fabric is soft, and the fleece isn't too bulky or thick -- just enough to provide extra warmth.  The heathered blue color goes with jeans and any number of other casual items.  Great!<br /><br />This is my first fleece-lined shirt and I'm surprised I haven't tried one before.  It works pretty well for keeping me warm."
4.0,Larger than expected but seems to be made out of good material
4.0,Comfortable dress - gets compliments!  Have owned it a year plus and the wear is showing --- sigh--- this is a &#34;fast fashion&#34; purchase  but I have been overall very happy with the dress.
4.0,Nice easy to wear dress. Looks good with leggings or by itself. Well made and the sizing is good. I wear a size 12/14 depending on the brand and the large in this fit perfectly.
4.0,Look Just Like The Picture!  And Speedy Shipping!
4.0,They where amazing it just sucks that you get one use out of them they where ripping threw out the day
4.0,"This dress is adorable. I have a very large chest (F cup), so the seams on the bust did not work well on me. That does not keep me from wearing it. I love the detail of the fabric, the belt, and the overall fit. If the seam was not there on the bust I would be in heaven, however for someone with more typical size breast, such as an A to a D cup, it would fit perfectly. The top is rather thin, so I do wear a cami underneath."
4.0,Overall it looks amazing! Only problem is it was way too big for my head so I'll have to make my own adjustments.
4.0,"Not very durable. Thin material, but not bad for the money."
4.0,I like the dress cute but very form fitting. If u have curves expect them to show in this dress.
4.0,"If you are looking to protect yourself from the sun, this hat may suit you.  It is lightweight and fashionable."
4.0,I really like this bra. The only fault I see is that is does not support great around the bottom.
4.0,"Not use to this material after wearing crew socks for years, but we'll see after a few months...So far, so good....."
4.0,Beautiful watch but too big for a 4 year old for sure... wish it came in a smaller size.
4.0,Stretches but pretty
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Ruth‚Äôs nose is a little funky looking in this keychain and not very accurate, but still looks like her. 14 bucks is also a mega rip off, but cest la vie"
4.0,"I got this headpiece for my cousin to wear the day of her baby shower and she loved it, it looked very pretty!"
4.0,"Didn't like to stay up like the picture, but could just be my ears"
4.0,"When I first put on these pants, my partner remarked, ‚Äúyou look like you should be in the desert with a blaster on your hip‚Äù. I knew right then I had made a good purchase, because that‚Äôs exactly the look I aim for in everyday life. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 105 lbs, and the ‚Äúsmall petite‚Äù size fits me perfectly, though the legs were still a teeny bit long, so if you plan to wear them with boots pulled over them anyway, I would recommend cutting the bottoms to a length that lets you avoid bunching.<br /> I took off 1 star for the 2 pointless, non-functional zippers (which I promptly removed with a seam ripper), but let me assure you that these pants have multiple, real, and enormous POCKETS! Like, there‚Äôs one on the side you could easily stow a family of squirrels in. Really not much to complain about here, and a lot to love; the material is stretchy but sturdy and I now feel ready to fight my way through the desert hordes."
4.0,not necessarily the comfiest thong out there but it works and it doesn't retain any water which makes it perfect as a shower sandal
4.0,Cute. Simple. Just what I needed.
4.0,"I like it, it appears are described. I do understand it is one size but not really come to terms with it yet."
4.0,"I wear a large and this oversized sweatshirt fits me how I expected it to, cropped but okay around. The crewneck isn't too tight, but the sleeves are a little long. This isn't a thick sweatshirt, it's very lightweight and didn't keep me very warm on Halloween night. The material is also a little weird, it's a cotton/spandex blend but feels more like polyester to me. The texture isn't noticeable up close, but it feels a little weird on my skin. Overall, it's an okay sweatshirt for light use, but it's not a winter staple."
4.0,I hate sunglass straps... but this one was festive and saved my sunglasses more than once in some rough surf. They‚Äôre now a permanent part of my beach / water gear.
4.0,Outfit was cute. A little on the larger size but fit my 13 lb baby well. The headband was not the same quality as the romper. We decided not to use it since it was shoddily put together.
4.0,"I had multiple discussions with the brand about this top. They don't have a wide size range in many of their workout bra tops. I knew I would never be able wear the size Large that they were suggesting I try but  I am too small in the bust as well as very slim.<br />The vendor told me to try this camisole and I liked the look of it. When I got it, the fabric is nice-- it's pretty stretchy. The bra cups don't fit me at all.  For someone who is a 32 B (and that's pretty small), the cups had zero support. If I was as 34B or larger (either the number or cup ) it would have fit really well.<br />I  wish I were a little larger on top because the overall look was good but because I am so small,  there's insufficient support). If you are a 34  or larger or a good-sized B to D cup I would say the Wandoak collection has some great styles  that would work out well. I am jealous because all the styles I wanted to try were size L."
4.0,Dress was really pretty. I ordered a bigger size after reading the reviews. I usually wear a small so I ordered a med and it was to big everywhere.
4.0,LOVED the fabric. Very nice. This is unusual now days. However the style did NOT look good on my shape at all.
4.0,"These are great glasses but they get the 4 star because they never truly get super dark. They are comfortable, they look and feel great, the magnetic arms are sweet and the style is on point. My only other small gripe would be these are sold as the Adam Sandovol line but instead of his logo on the arms you get the Epoc Eyewear one, but really that's just an observational thing."
4.0,Wry Pretty!! Great Rhinestones!  All Stones on the mask non broken off!
4.0,"I love the dress, although it's a little too big. I'm 5 feet tall and 96 lbs so I'm not surprised it's a little big. I got the small"
4.0,"These work well,but they are a bit cheap feeling, and the lenses could be darker, both to filter more light and hide the glasses behind them."
4.0,"These are really 4.5 stars. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is they are thick and a bit warm. Otherwise some of the best compression socks out there. If you are in a cold climate or in winter, get them. But for summers and warm climates I prefer a thinner compression sock."
4.0,Nice belt.  Looks like picture.  Looks more expensive than the price actually is.  Little bit smaller than expected but fits well.
4.0,"Good Value, maybe not thet best looking crucifix, the details are a little poor, but well worth the money and don't forget to have it blessed."
4.0,"Got this for my daughter, she absolutely loves it. It can pull on your hair though, only because of the gems on it, however it's very very pretty on."
4.0,"I received the Ironborn 2.0 textile jacket from Viking Cycle without really knowing what to expect.  For this review, you have to keep in mind this is a sub-$100 jacket.<br /><br />My first impression was that the jacket is really well-built, feels solid, and is loaded with features.  The torso on the large was the right amount of snug (I'm 6'3"", 200 lbs., and have roughly a 43"" chest), but the sleeves could stand to be another 1/2"" longer or so.<br /><br />The armor it came with appears to be similar to RevIt's SeeSmart series, but I should disclose I do not have any first-hand experience with the SeeSmart armor.  It is very light, rather thin, and, with the perforations in the base, it ought to breathe well.<br /><br />I wore the jacket when I took my bike on the test ride after some maintenance and it did stop a lot of wind.  However, the vest liner leaves a lot to be desired.  Fortunately, the zip pattern appears to be the same as another jacket, so I could swap them out.<br /><br />I do appreciate all the vents and pockets.  Being able to adjust the amount airflow is great for days when the temperature will vary greatly.  The pockets allow you to carry lots of smaller items and the outer ones are easily accessed.<br /><br />The neoprene around the neck helped relieve any possible irritation, but I did find it rubbed if I turned my neck the wrong way.  The sleeves, cuffs, and waist are all adjustable, resulting in a very customizable fit.  Once it was locked down, I felt like I could wear it for an indefinite amount of time while riding.<br /><br />The material may be water-resistant, but I'd personally not ride in the rain with just the jacket.  I would feel much better with an additional rain suit.<br /><br />No, it's not a Rev'It or Dainese, but for the price, it's a fantastic starter jacket.  In all honesty, it seems like it would do well for a long day of riding.  Being able to modulate the amount of heat trapped on the fly is a great benefit."
4.0,Very sexy and fitting to the curves!
4.0,"These get the job done.<br /><br />I ordered this a few months ago and have used it regularly.<br />Considering the plastic lenses and frames are flexible and do feel cheap, they get the job done.<br />(FYI - They feel lighter and more flimsy than a pair of children's sunglasses.)<br />They clip on your glasses but what set these apart are the rubber clip covering stay on.  I bought a different brand and the rubber clip covers fell off.  These have been fine for a few months now.<br /><br />I do want to mention that when I used this, I had trouble seeing my phone gps while driving.<br />It's kinda annoying to flip the lens up to see my phone gps.  When I wore my sunglasses over my contacts, I never had this issue.<br />So keep in mind, when you use these you might not be able to see your phone.<br />(I noticed I couldn't see the screen when my phone was horizontal, but I could the screen when my phone is vertical.  It's weird, I know, but I guess it depends on your phone.)"
4.0,"The shirt is beautiful. The lace work is very pretty, and the color (red) is perfect for either a night out or to wear to work."
4.0,"Looks great, love them but my feet are narrow and this sandals are to wide for me in the arch."
4.0,Cute but easily tangled. Easy to dress up or down.
4.0,"Fits just like the picture shows. Very well made. Cute color. Warm, and will do well this winter!"
4.0,"I bought these for my 10 year old, but the waist line is too wide, while the legs are tighter..."
4.0,"The hem line seems to be a little lower in the front, come up at the sides, and back down in the back.  I don't like that.  Wish it was an even hem.  I'll be returning it."
4.0,"I love this suit! I only have one complaint, it hugs my neck and I don't like anything around my neck."
4.0,This set is awesome. It's cohesive and pairs well with most things I wear.
4.0,"The shoes are comfortable but they run a bit big, other than that they are good shoes"
4.0,"Larger cats (10-11 lbs) don‚Äôt fit well but smaller cats (9 lbs or less) fit perfectly.  The opening for your head is a bit snug.  I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, the sweater is comfortable and warm, she loves the thumb hole feature and the ears!"
4.0,"These were adorable, volunteer staff love to wear their pins.  Wish they were just a little larger."
4.0,"I would have liked for the material to be a little bit thicker. But it's a beautiful dress,and it came on time."
4.0,I brought this wallet because of the ability  to  button it up. very  pleased  with this product
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture and arrived fast! Perfect size and love that it is not stiff.
4.0,These feel nice and are long enough but they were a little thin.
4.0,"I am happy within the fit, style and look. I do wear it often. It's light and airy; it looks nice. I gave 4 stars because the stitches in the sewing could have been better. But it still looks nice."
4.0,"Well made and fits nicely, however a deeper v neck would be complimentary.  Great item"
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute on but the pants are extremely long, and almost goes up to my chest.  Was not expecting that at all."
4.0,"I love them on, fit just right."
4.0,After a few washed it seems to get bad. but other wise it's cheap for so many and its good quality.
4.0,"The item is really good, I am enjoying it. One complaint - the is not cilyndric like the one on the amazon picture, did came with interior case as discribed. I recommend the seller to be attentive on this details."
4.0,Silky and long. It felt breezy on the legs and light to wear; perfect for the spring and summer.
4.0,Was a little big up too other than I love the dress and material
4.0,"It's not the color in the picture, more of a fire engine red. The fabric is a bit stiff when you get it but after a wash it's fine. It's also pretty thin but not bad. Only putting 4 stars since the color was off."
4.0,Nice product for the value
4.0,pretty but the sizes listed are not correct
4.0,"The fit was surprising!y  good .I thought they would be short ,but they were perfect!üòä"
4.0,Tru to size. It is an attractive piece of jewelry
4.0,recomendable 100%
4.0,This is definitely a conversation piece!! Much larger than expected but pretty interesting..
4.0,The dress fit me quite well. The only problem was that I wish the straps were adjustable because they kept on falling off my shoulders.
4.0,Really nice dress & pretty pattern. I would go up a size. Tight in the chest area.
4.0,"This is a nice small size for pockets, etc.  It is well made and cute."
4.0,Fits very good. Very comfortable too. Good after so many washes.Good buy. Good for every day use.
4.0,Kids are happy with the purchase and has been surviving the kids use.  Actually good pair of sun glasses. Delivery was timely.
4.0,"Loved the colors. Just about a size too small. It is a longer length, which I love. It is a really good well made sweater, very warm heavy knit."
4.0,They are very warm. Well made. Unfortunately a little small for me.
4.0,"Love the way the top fits, can tie as tight or loose as you like"
4.0,"I normally wear size 7, but I ordered these in 6 and they fit perfect.  I wish they had a thicker band."
4.0,Love this Bag but after using a little while the straps are spreading.  Strings hanging off all over straps.  So it didn‚Äôt last too long.  Had to retire it already
4.0,"This suit was surprisingly cute! Fits great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 34C and a muscular 160lbs and I ordered a large which is my usual size. It did snag on the concrete pool pretty bad so I deducted a star. But I really do love this suit!"
4.0,It looks beautiful but the words aren't as large as they are in the picture. Wearing this in memorial of my uncle that passed away. Very happy with it otherwise
4.0,"Love these!! Wear them everyday! Very cute, and comfortable enough to wear all the time! Great purchase"
4.0,Ordered for a Harry Potter themed birthday party; very nice.
4.0,I find the sandals very comfortable and light but I did have to send the original pair back as they were too small.  I normally wear a 9.5 shoe and assumed that a size 10 sandal would be the appropriate size.  My heel was hanging over the back so I replaced them with an 11.  They're prefect.  This is my first pair of Reef's and once I got the correct size they're everything that I expected.  I gave a 4 star as I haven't had them long enough to see whether they hold up over time.
4.0,Nice suit for the price ...  Pants needs to be hemmed which is no problem.
4.0,Well made -- what buy again.
4.0,Happy with the price and how they work. I thread my headphones into them to make noise canceling headphones when I cut grass. Only one problem is sometimes the metal bars come out of the ear parts when you hold them. Haven't had a problem other than that. Would recommend
4.0,"Very pretty, runs tight in the upper arms."
4.0,"This watch band was better quality than I expected for the price. I may want to buy another one. This one came with tools and springs to hold it in, which I already have. It makes me winder if I can buy another for a few dollars off without them. Still, great product and package design."
4.0,"As many people have said these aren't 30x magnification and I knew that upon buying them. I was looking for a decent 10x loupe to assist in my coin collecting. It is important to be able to view all or most of the coin at one time and this loupe allows me to do it. Now it isn't a Hastings or a Bausch and Lomb but for the price I think you get your moneys worth. As some others have said there are dust specks in the glass that you can't get out but this does not really stop you from using it, it is just a tad annoying at times. The loupe does not stay shut or have any sort of clasp so putting it on a necklace to have around wasn't going to work without some modification. At the underside of the top where the loupe is fully closed I placed some foam rubber to make friction and hold the loupe closed when on a necklace but easily open it when I need it.<br /><br />I gave it 4 our of 5 stars because I feel the dust in the glass is something that could easily have been prevented especially with other people mentioning it. When you need a couple loupes at a good price that will work decently at 10x then look no further. Whether it is your first loupe or you have an expensive one and want something else to keep around in areas it could be damaged or broken then this is a good option for you. Enjoy!"
4.0,Fast shipping! Says it would arrive a month later but came in 5 days later. I have somewhat wide hips and thick thighs so the shorts fit awkwardly. The top fit nice and loosely. I ordered a medium. I weigh 135 lbs and I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù
4.0,"I bought these gloves for my bicycle commute to work every morning. It can be a tad bit chilly in the morning, and I wanted them for warmth, as well as for the added grip on the handlebars. They get the job done for a reasonable price.<br />My only gripes would be that the wrist cuffs have some threads that pull and unravel a bit and the liners are kinda flimsy. But my hands are shielded from the cold and that was my main goal here. I do like the grip pads on the palm and index finger; they're nice for pulling the brake lever and for changing gears with my grip shifters."
4.0,Too think and not worth $50 tbh. Xl is not even close. More like a medium. Really upset about it.
4.0,"I like this necklace, it works well with summer outfits. I would buy it again."
4.0,These were a little tighter in the waist than they should have been.
4.0,"I like the dress. Got the royal blue as the price was right and for casual outings. Can wear a belt to emphasize the waistline and to give shape. It comes up 1.5 inches above knees. Comfortable, swingy at the bottom and not wrinkly. Thinnish jersey material so I wore my bra and gym shorts underneath (I almost always wear gym shorts underneath dresses if bare legged). Got the small as because of the loose style and fit me really well without being tight or loose around my bust. The rest doesn't matter because of the style.  For reference I am 5.3, 34C bra, 27/28 waist and 36 hips. Dress size 6 in US and pant sz 4.  !30lbs."
4.0,I would like it better if it was a tunic style. Nice material
4.0,Metal part of the shoulder strap is sharp and you can get scratch easily.<br />Like this bag anyway.
4.0,Just what I ordered! Great for use after a shower.
4.0,Watch the video. Nice fit but the pearls are way smaller. Also the picture of the woman is photoshopped. Look at the hands and neck. That‚Äôs why the sweater looks different than pictured
4.0,"Great little wristlet!  It fits my iPhone (with a case on it), lipstick and and all necessary cards/cash.  And no animals were harmed in the making of product!  :-)"
4.0,"i purchased this for my wife and she loves it very much  she indicated that it can accommodate all her articles and personal woman stuff she showed her friends who fell in love with it also. This being the third one i purchased for her black, purple and rose red highly recommended  as gift items for wife, girlfriends, and other female  friends"
4.0,It is a lot looser than I was expecting. You definitely have to wear something under it like a bralette because the front comes down. Also the material is thin but other than that I really like it. It's a nice summer look.
4.0,Prints and style are cute but I wish the length was longer. I liked supersized sleeping gown so Ordered XL. 5‚Äô7‚Äù. 118 lbs.
4.0,its a little tight for an XL.
4.0,"I like very much, good fabric, very nice yellow color , just  a little hard to put it on !!"
4.0,Great for daughters cosplay
4.0,Gift was liked alot
4.0,"My head is slightly bigger than average so I half expected the hat to be too small. Luckily, it was just slightly too small; however, still fit on my head and it was impossible to tell that it was a tad small. It is also quite lovely and perfect for the beach! Very classy and went with all of my outfits. My only gripe is that the item cannot be folded like other hats so I was forced to carry it throughout the airport and during our 9 hour travel day to avoid creasing."
4.0,"La tela es de huequitos, no llega a ser transparente, pensaba que era otra tela pero esta bien."
4.0,Looks great and easy to read. Fits on wrist without any pinching. Get lots of compliments.
4.0,I will likely order more of these. I like that they inflate so I can pack them for travel and not take up weight or space.
4.0,Very cute bracelet. Has a few rough edges but overall for $3.99 it is a fun piece to add to my collection. Love all the colors and looks nice on
4.0,The money holder-clip can be easily removed. I like that after a year cards still don't slip out.
4.0,"I ordered the bright pink dress according to my measurements and it fit perfectly! 32/27/33 and I ordered the small. There's a little stretch to it, but I would order your normal dress size. Good quality. I would have kept the dress except that the gathered part of the fabric at the waist was very unflattering on me. My husband said it made the dress look like it didn't fit right and was messy. It definitely didn't look like I expected it to. It was a little too much. But it was comfortable!"
4.0,"Boyfriend loves it but he accidentally broke a part of it, but I'm sure we can fix it."
4.0,Nice fit and fabric but was oddly TOO flattering...too boobalicious for work lol! If you want to enhance your bustline this is your dress!
4.0,Little small and revealing.  I am normally a Small or Extra Small.  Still sexy.
4.0,"Im 5'7 145lb  ordered Medium and it fits perfect. Dress is a bit see thru but that is an way fix. I didn't give 5 stars because of the chest area see photo it's not thT my Brest are big it's just weirdly sew I think! Its a light yellow good for summer but it's just tooo yellow for me, I'm still wearing it wish they had a darker mustard  yellow . I ordered a blue one just because I'm<br />Happy with this one !!"
4.0,Upon unpacking the chain wasn‚Äôt together. I say broken but it looks like it was just never put together. This is a great piece of costume/holiday jewelry. It is a great size so you can actually see what it is. Nothing is chipping or peeling up and it is just freaking adorable. A quick minute with a pair of pliers and I had the chain together and in gift-able  condition.  The chain is long but not too long just about anyone should be able to slip it over their head without unclipping it. Overall it seems decently strong and it‚Äôs chain is thicker than I expected. Great thanksgiving accessory.
4.0,I did not like my arms were not free to move could improve arm flexibility.
4.0,and both of them loved the shoes.  Mom has worn them everyday since.  They are like houseshoes but can be worn outside because of the hard soles.
4.0,Loved the quality and the material that was used. Super soft and fit perfectly on me.
4.0,"Very good,soft,quality material,comfortable and lightweight.Run large.36 fits like 38"
4.0,"Ok, what you see is what you get. That is the case here.  But nothing can go wrong with this inexpensive Spring-y scarf. When NYC offered a beautiful Spring day today...I took the chance to wear the scarf. This is a scarf that will not warm your neck, instead it felt cool when worn (which I like at this time of the year). The material is soft and easily wrinkles when not properly stored but thankfully, you can rearrange it and ""fluff"" it again before wearing. The color goes with anything too."
4.0,Nice dress somewhat small
4.0,These rings are tiny. My piercing is a 20 gauge and I believe they are smaller in size then that. Hopefully they will be safe enough for my nose. The package says made in China so idk how low of quality they will be in the long haul.
4.0,"Very cute, but feels more costume like than elegant. Lucky for me I am wearing it to a ugly Christmas sweater party.<br /><br />I ordered an XL and weight about 200 lbs. I wear it at my waist and it‚Äôs just below my knees. I am 5‚Äô1"
4.0,Great jacket but sleeves at wrist stretches out easily and so does the waist
4.0,Good quality fabric. Thicker material than I thought. Good for Spring weather.
4.0,"Very cute, but too large under the armpit and waist.  The strap of my bra showed and you would need to wear a cami or something underneath it. It is a really cute dress, so I will be exchanging it for a smaller size.<br />**Correction - I can't order a smaller size bc there is no extra small. How disappointing!"
4.0,"Got it for a photo session and it worked perfectly, it was just really thin and kept twisting. I had to make sure it was right in every shot where it should of stayed put"
4.0,Cute dress. Shorter than I expected
4.0,"This blouse is very pretty and flattering. The only downside is that I ordered a small and received a medium, so it fits a little big, not so much to return it. I can fixed it."
4.0,Iys
4.0,My husband bough these because his other sunglasses broke.<br />These fit his head nicely and they look good.
4.0,"This is a good price and value for what you receive.<br />I used it as part of a Halloween costume.<br />I don't really see them as part of an every day outfit...definitely more costume-oriented...but hey...who am I to judge!<br /><br />Well-made, colorful, vibrant."
4.0,"These look great. Very well distressed to give just enough of a worn in, vintage look. Detailed stitching is also well done. Definitely not a winter pair of boots.<br /><br />Save from the looks of them, order a 1/2 size up. I wish I did. They‚Äôre a bit cramped at start of the toes (from the pinky toe inward). Needed them for a last second work trip (which I missed), so I‚Äôm stuck with them as is.<br /><br />The outsoles didn‚Äôt look like much at first, but they grip pretty well. How they hold up from the daily grind remains to be seen. My 6.5 year old pair of Bed Stu‚Äôs did quite well the first 4 years. Hopefully these do too.<br /><br />EDIT: I just noticed the return window is 60 days! These are being returned, as I've been unable to get comfortable in them while walking around the apartment."
4.0,My daughter was so happy. She just broke her last pair and did not know where to get some.
4.0,Bought this product for a teammate. Was a little bit big for their smaller arm but that was expected. The velcro has held up well with time.
4.0,"great service awesome shirt , but no fault but my own its a little tight , I gained a few lbs."
4.0,"Is the one I want , feel like strong and have lot the colors can choose üëçüèª"
4.0,Love the watch! It looks so pretty. The watch cover that comes with it does not fit at all.
4.0,"Very nice perchasing experience, received right away, and very happy with product....."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable and a great fit. I like a lot and would buy again. Would have given 5 stars except I don't like the front pockets. Although they are deep which I like, they have a vinyl trim that bulges out. It is more of a look thing,  but are very accommodating to a cell phone. My pockets are empty when I work out so I plan to have them sewn shut."
4.0,"For the price I'm very pleased. Comfortable flats and they aren't too flimsy (however you wouldn't want to wear them on a rainy day,  for sure.) I would definitely order again."
4.0,"I love these bracelets, I bought it for me and my boyfriend. I gave him the black one and kept the white one I noticed though that the white one became very dirty and very hard to clean."
4.0,Beautiful set but the earring posts break easily and seem malleable
4.0,Big size and smaller underwear.
4.0,"This is a good-looking watch, nicely finished case and markings.  So far, seems to be keeping good time.  The hands are not luminous and the watch band is economy model but for $17.00, this watch is a bargain.  I considered an Invicta for $55 but Invicta warranty is only one year which seems odd for such a supposedly better quality watch."
4.0,Product was too big but everything else was on point.
4.0,"I did not give this a 5 because I have not worn it out yet- (just received in the mail today). So far, though, I like it and hope to wear it often."
4.0,my daughter looked so beautiful in this dress.  great dress for the price
4.0,I like the dress it‚Äôs super cute but it‚Äôs see through. And wearing a shirt under it makes it worse. Hopefully I can figure someone out so I can wear it.
4.0,"This item is incredible bargain if you have the right mounting for it and don't live somewhere where you have high winds or storms (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area). I already had a very strong, through the table mount for the umbrella and I'm definitely going to take it down before the first El Ni√±o storm hits this fall.<br /><br />It is not completely opaque as other reviews have said but that's actually a positive for me."
4.0,"Delivered quickly!<br />However, it's really small. I had to pry it open just a bit to get it to fit.<br />You get what you pay for..<br /><br />Overall, looks really cool. Just really small"
4.0,I purchased this belt for daily use.  I work in an office.<br /><br />It is Convenience to use. It can match my black pants or khakis pants since you are able to flip the belt buckle. This is great when traveling so I do not need to carry 2 belts.<br /><br />The belt is made with soft material that feel nice.  The belt buckle is made with shiny metal.<br /><br />I recommend this belt if you are looking basic and useful belt for work. My only wish is that they display the length of the belt in inches instead of cm.
4.0,"look just like uggs. comfy, fit true to size. the only reason they didnt get a five is because the bottoms are a little hard. but the fur is really thick. they are nice."
4.0,Nice coat but not as warm as thought
4.0,Works well with jeans
4.0,This dress was NOT polyester it is rayon.  I was hoping to get polyester as described.
4.0,"They fit great and are very comfy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 195 with a bigger chest so I went up a size from my regular shirt size and they fit perfect. Although the material in one of the tanks unraveled and has a hole now, I‚Äôm happy with the fit"
4.0,They are thin & comfortable. Great for summer & the shoes that go with summer. The heal has a strip to keep the sock from slipping into your shoe
4.0,"Super cute hat, bought for a child and it fits great and will grow with them."
4.0,Cool color and nice sizes. The only thing they are easily sensitive to scratches. I rolled them into my closet and when I went to look at them again I found some scratches and scuff marks. I haven‚Äôt traveled with them yet but when I do i can expect them to look like Freddy Krueger handle my bags.
4.0,Like that you get 12 for the price. Good for me since I always lose and break glasses. Not the best quality but you get what you pay for.
4.0,"I liked the color and design, the material and that it was long but didn't care to much for the cut on myself. I felt like I was wearing a tent."
4.0,"I LOVE this robe! I would have given it 5 stars if it zipped all the way instead of half way. It is so soft & warm. I love the hood and the pockets. It is true to size, so if you want it baggy, go 1 size up. It isn't a cheap material & it is well made.  The sleeves are a little tight. I can't pull them up very far."
4.0,They are cute but I was expecting them to be larger. The thickness is perfect but the size looks like to size of a 50 cent coin. If that's what you are looking for these are perfect because they are really cute and have a really good price. I just wanted something larger.
4.0,Just a tad large. I'm 5'2&#34; and 120 lbs and ordered a medium. Still very cute but it hangs lower than I'd like so I'll shorten the straps. It rests on the hips rather than waist.
4.0,Not a bad sweater for the price.
4.0,"Stylish good looks. And they feel like they're built well. Plus, it came with a cool case."
4.0,It's very thin. My son has to wear extra clothes under for the cold weather in Michigan at the end of Oct. My son is 10 month old (50% on weight 98% on height) it perfectly fit for him.
4.0,"These shoes are super cute, but if you don‚Äôt have wide feet, your foot will slide right out of them. I purchased 2 pair in an 8, too big & too wide. I returned them and then I purchased 3 pair in a size 7 still too wide. I‚Äôm returning those today. I‚Äôm very disappointed because these shoes are sooo cute!"
4.0,Great I like it
4.0,"I wouldn't really say this is one size fits all...maybe to a size 12. So I&#34;ll be giving this as a gift to my sister-in-law. It's pretty, kind of bohemian like. I bought it because I like the fact that it is light and covers the shoulders...where I always get burned. It is 47 1/2&#34; Long and 23&#34; wide at top (25&#34; down) the rest of the length is open at the sides.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I take this very seriously as I rely on reviews, like many of you, to make purchases. Nothing has been asked of me other than to give an honest review of the product, and as you can see from my review history it has no effect on my opinion. If this review has helped you make a decision, please hit the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thank you"
4.0,"Made really well. Very thick metal, unable to bend it to make it fit my small wrost, sadly, had to return it."
4.0,It is value for money.
4.0,Not to bad lenses do pop out easy when cleaning them but I have never had a prob while wearing them but for the price I paid not bad
4.0,It was wonderful except that it was just a hair too small to wear comfortably. But I liked it so much that I kept it and used it as an earring. It's sturdy and hasn't rusted nor have I reacted to the metal.
4.0,"I absolutely love this skort, the only downfall is the fact that the shorts ride up pretty badly. But, not enough that I wouldn't wear it again."
4.0,"This was a gift for a friend that chose her zodiac to give her the fierce strength she needs while going through chemo. The piece is very nice. The jade was very light, hence the four stars instead of five. I would recommend though."
4.0,"These are the measurements for the large size I received:<br /><br />Shoulders: 19-1/2""<br />Chest: 44""<br />Waist: 41""<br />Sleeve: 26-1/2""<br /><br />That's a little less at the waist than usual for a large flannel shirt, but not much. It's actually fairly common for regular large dress shirts.<br /><br />Those sleeves are long. The cuffs keep them from falling down past the hands, but if you want a tailored look you'd better have long arms.<br /><br />The fabric is typical medium-weight flannel, nice and soft.<br /><br />There's an extra button sewn onto a tail.<br /><br />Machine wash cold but hand wash recommended, no bleach, hang dry, no tumble dry, warm iron, dry clean OK.<br /><br />Emiqude is a recent brand from China."
4.0,Very pretty and dainty necklace. Love the star and the moon. I felt the charms could have been slightly bigger and would have created a much more eye catching elegant appearance. But still enjoy it for how it looks around my neck with a vneck or low cut top on.
4.0,"I purchased this dress for my Halloween costume (a hand maid). It is a decent dress. Quite stretchy fabric. A little on the thin side, so may have to wear a slip underneath. But the sleeves and hem are a good length and the functional pockets are a nice touch. The color red is a bright true red. I got the Large, I am 5'8 and 130 lbs and this fit as expected, perhaps a tiny bit large. Could probably have got away with a medium but I did not want it to cling to me. Overall I am pleased."
4.0,Great for people like me<br />I loves hats but have lots of problems finding hats that fit. I have a small head and not a lot of hair<br />This makes the hats fit better
4.0,"I loved this wallet but unfortunately the description didn't specify which phones would fit.  I took a chance, but, it's too small for my Samsung S3."
4.0,"Great for workout out. Doesn't roll up as I squat. Good material. I'm 5'5"". 155lb and ordered a Large. Fits just right."
4.0,Love the way the top fits and the bottom flows nicely. Great fit!
4.0,Bought these for my sister. No complaints so far.
4.0,"Has nice fit, doesn't feel as cheap as expected so that was a bonus.  I ordered a size larger, thinking it may run small or shrink.... but feels comfy"
4.0,"Beautiful garment but very thin material. Jacket looks too cheap to wear, but dress and belt look nice together. JUST SO THIN."
4.0,"I love these shoes.  I've had them for about a year, now.  Patent leather is awesome - scuffs just wipe right off with your hand.  (Not like vinyl patent, where scuffs are permanent.)  If you've never worn real patent leather, you're in for a treat as to how durable and snazzy looking these are.  I get compliments on them all the time.  These are fairly comfortable - didn't need a lot of break in time.  I have walked several blocks in them over lunch and been fine (I am over weight, and comfortable shoes can be a problem).  I would not want to &#34;shop till you drop&#34; in them,  I gave them 4 stars because my feet sweat a little in them, and I have slightly damp socks when I take them off.  This has not been a major issue for me - and I may have them on for 10 hours at a time.  I do not wear them several days in a row.  I have a &#34;C&#34; width foot, and the wide is ok - maybe a tad on the snug side.  If you wear a true &#34;B&#34; width - I think medium will be OK.  But, if you really have a &#34;C&#34; width foot, get the wide.  The length runs true to size compared to other Clarks shoes."
4.0,"Awesome set, it arrived sooner then expected. Beautiful shiny look, heavy definitely looks like quality merchandise. I will be getting 3 more sets for my sister-in-law and my two daughters."
4.0,The wave caps did not last long
4.0,Fits big and I even ordered a year under üòî will be washing and hoping it shrinks but overall beautiful my daughter loves it.
4.0,"Cups fit well, I had to take in the sides because it was bigger than I expected"
4.0,Fit narrow but very comfortable.
4.0,"I would say that I could not find much wrong with this cap, except that it was a brighter red than expected. It  fitted this ""big ole noggin"" so I would say that the fit was good! Good cap for the money!"
4.0,"It's a beautiful watch case and he loved it, but I had to take a star away. It looked as if someone sat something hot on the top of it. It's discolored at the top from what looks like very hot steam."
4.0,I like the plastic covers because they look like metal but will not easily scratch my Apple watch.  The ones from this company stay on pretty well also.
4.0,The fit was perfect but top area is a bit different
4.0,"Earsocks are an adequate replacement for OEM earsocks, just not as ""snug"" on the frame as the originals.  Nosepieces snapped right in."
4.0,"The elastic is a bit tight so it doesn't stay put on shoulders (goes up) and you have to continually pull down back into place. Other than that, super cute."
4.0,Just got these and love the design.  The downside would be that they are clearly silicone upon handling them... even though the product title states that they are leather. :/
4.0,"The slippers are very warm and comfortable, very soft to walk in. I ordered my size but they are a lite big."
4.0,Very happy with this purchase. Looked much more expensive than it was. DIL loved it!
4.0,I love the stylish figure in these recommended to friends and family
4.0,"These are very beautiful, and look just like the image. I'm particularly fond of the red and back one.<br /><br />My only issue is that the black and green piece is extremely delicate, and part of it snapped when taking the ball off the barbell for the first time, although it should be easy enough to fix. The other two are very sturdy, I've been wearing the red and black one for about a month now, with no signs of wear.<br /><br />All the bats can be removed entirely from the bar they're on, allowing for easy cleaning, and they have a rubber o ring to prevent them from sliding while the jewelry is being worn.<br /><br />Overall,  I'm very happy with this product."
4.0,The fit is great.  They do the job.  Easy to wear and drive.  Wish the gloves were the same complexion as my skin.
4.0,Thinner and larger than I expected but still very cute.
4.0,This under skirt fit my daughter well. So she wound up not needing to use it with her dress as her dress was too well fitted and it caused the hem of her dress to lift up too much. But it was a nice under skirt.
4.0,My grand daughter loved the set.
4.0,Finally a shoe I can we‚Äôre fits good for me eve tho one foot swells up I bought another pair just to have hhem
4.0,"This is awesome! As soon as I had a problem, they IMMEDIATELY responded and solved it! Thanks!"
4.0,Fit great and very comfortable.... will buy again when needed.
4.0,"I‚Äôve been searching for a good dupe for the scuba hoodie. Ive never owned a scuba hoodie, but this looks pretty close! There seems to be a few differences in logo placement and some of the stitching. I did see that the fabric is slightly different than the original, but not a huge difference according to the tag. Overall great quality. Zipper glides well and doesn‚Äôt catch. Fleece lining feels soft and cozy. Hood is double lined. Perfect oversized fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 118 lbs and I got an XS. I could have sized down, but prefer the oversized fit. I‚Äôll update after I‚Äôve worn it for a bit and washed."
4.0,Very nice tunic top and fits well. Better than expected and washes up nicely.
4.0,It runs two or three sizes small.
4.0,I didn't expect much out of these. More of a you get what you pay for. They are great for the money. They are a little wonky and need to be bent into the correct shape and they are stiff to open at first. I did take away one star because one pair I can't get unfolded no matter what I do. But over all great for the price.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:82d91745aafa0ab5409c3d97eeba4c55]] Absolutely enjoy these bands. The band itself is a little stiff and catches a bit on the metal, thought I would buy these again in the future."
4.0,I love my earrings! Look great. Unfortunately I didn't get exactly what the picture shows. I received 3 &#34;jerk&#34; earrings and only one &#34;bitch&#34; one so definitely beware of that happening to you
4.0,Very cute and a decent weight for a novelty sock.
4.0,A little short and the quality is good
4.0,Great glasses. Lens scratch relatively easy but in general good glasses
4.0,Nice material warm even hubby complimented it
4.0,It‚Äôs so terribly hard for me to find T-shirt‚Äôs that fit my husband but this one fit perfectly. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô4‚Äù and has a long torso so most shirts that fit everywhere else right were always to short in that dept. The graphics were perfect and he LOVES the shirt! I‚Äôm so happy with this purchase :)
4.0,I'm giving these four stars and not five for one reason only. One of the grommets that vent the boot and allow water to flow out of the boot fell out after four months.  Other than that these boots have great support and can run all day.  They fit just like there shoes doe and the laces are of great quality that flex and allow better ankle articulation.  I would buy these again.
4.0,"I love this dress!! I'm very petit in the chest area, and this dress actually fit PERFECTLY!! The only downfall, which isn't really a downfall, is I thought the sleeves would be a little bigger near the hands."
4.0,"Very thin, you can feel the paper/cardboard in the brim. The wrinkles from shipping took awhile to get out since the hat was folded and make creases in the brim. Everything else is cotton - also thin. Its comfortable and good but somehow feels overpriced for its construction.<br />But I have a feeling I'll like this in the long wrong b/c its nothing more then you see."
4.0,"I bought these shoes for my 5 year old son. They were the closest thing I could find to a pair of beloved Nikes that he had completely worn through.<br />I like the elastic/vecro combination. The bright colors (blue and yellow) were just want he wanted, too. The &#34;ventilator&#34; ‚Äì the fact that the fabric is a mesh ‚Äì is fine for summer, spring and fall, but these wouldn't make a good winter shoe. I like the way the rubber sole comes up a bit over the toe. (My kids are always dragging their toes while on their bikes.) The mesh has started to pull away from the rubber at the toe a bit (after 6 week of solid wear). But it's not destroyed yet. I hope it lasts. Rubber soles could have better traction, in my opinion. But the five year old is happy!"
4.0,The jumpsuit looks like a bed sheet. I was going to send it back but I added a colored belt with it and it was ok for the occasion. Nothing flattering about it at all.
4.0,My son loves them! They are a little bit but he will grow into them!!
4.0,I used these for skiing. The are OK for temps that are 20 oF and above. They don‚Äôt do well in extreme cold.
4.0,It was comfortable .. But plan . I had my niece put some bling on it .. They it was Rey pretty ...
4.0,Fair looking.
4.0,Very cute and soft onesie. Fits well....maybe a tiny bit on the small side. Only complaint is that the snaps are plastic and cheap and kept coming undone. Should have used metal snaps.
4.0,I had always used the normal touch lights.  This one works just fine.
4.0,"This is by far the most breathable, comfortable and the prettiest face covering I've tried...yet don't get this for protection. It's pretty see thru lol. That being said, I only like to wear this one for outdoors only. But don't rely on this for any virus protection!"
4.0,It is good for this price.
4.0,"Overall a great pair of earrings for the price.  The quality is not great, but they are what you would expect for $8.00.  I wanted to try the style but was doubtful that I would like them on myself so I decided to try these given how affordable they are.  I was surprised at how much I like the styling.  The only problems were 1) the weight was a little heavy.  Not bothersome for dinner out or a few hours but the weight would bother me if I wore them all day and 2) The thread on the fringe doesn't fall exactly right. When I got them the fringe was split and sticking out too far on the sides.  I was able to sort of play with it and brush it down to look right but again I'm not sure if that would have stayed if I wore them for longer than a few hours."
4.0,love it! i love the ovrrsized and sturdy look to it feel so glammed up in this. Great buy..luv it
4.0,The item arrived on time and new condition. The item was as described. The item was thin and cheaply made.
4.0,Nice made style nice price fast ship. I did think it would be bigger.<br />Some people have big heads or hair . Over all nice ! Thank you
4.0,Ten year old granddaughter loves this...but I find it a bit lightweight for an adult...serves our purposes well...
4.0,"Nice fit, looks nice with leggings, which is exactly what I wanted. The green is much lighter (more mint) than I had expected, but I really do like this shirt more than other long shirts/ tunics that I have purchased on Amazon. Runs true to size, so I suggest purchasing the size that you normally wear, and do not dry with heat."
4.0,Glasses are light and comfortable.  They collect a bit of moisture around the nose and on the upper part of the lens but that can be managed.  I wish that they had additional options for colors.
4.0,This is a good bluetooth system.  People can hear me while I am talking.  Music and other sounds are clear...had to turn down as this goes very loud.  I liked it so much I bought one for my granddaughter for Christmas.
4.0,They float well
4.0,"I loved this piece and that it came earlier than expected.  It did break by the end of the night, but I was dancing like a crazy person so it could have been my own fault.  It was only a couple of dollars so it was all worth it!!"
4.0,Received this item and it was as advertised and seems well constructed. Have not yet used it but will provide additional comments after use.
4.0,"Nice little key ring, hook part is a little small but still works well. Looks good."
4.0,Was given as a Christmas gift and do not know if she likes it or no.  I gave it to a teenager so I might not ever hear is she likes it.
4.0,Too small and too thin
4.0,It feels a little high waisted but overall I'm satisfied.
4.0,"Great product. Bought for compression of arms. Looks like it would fit a doll when arrived, but it's very stretchy and works great for compression. It also works like a push-up bra. I am 5'3 158 lbs. Arms are 12.5&#34; around. To put on, slip one arm at a time into sleeves, then pull over head, then unravel and pull over chest. I'm currently wearing compression garments under this so it tends to bunch up under my bra. I don't know if it would without a slippery garment underneath or not. It also cuts into the sides of my breasts, but I am a 36D, so that might not happen if you are smaller in the bust. It creeps up on the arms away from elbows as well, which I need to keep pulling down, but might be an advantage to shorter sleeved tops. Very close to my skin color which I like. I wear size medium tops and the medium fit me well. To take it off you must be able to grab with criss-crossed arms and pull over your head."
4.0,Really soft and comfy. Would have given 5 stars BUT when I opened the package it was in the smell was atrocious. I had to wash it seperatly TWICE before I could even wear it.
4.0,"nice colors, but a bit too small"
4.0,My daughter likes these a lot. She says they are a little too thick for her but someone else may find that better.
4.0,"Super-comfortable top, great price, washes well and looks great!"
4.0,"These shorts are made from soft material with mix of rayon, polyamide and spandex. S size fits me well but the design is a little strange. They are a combination of sporty and casual shorts. As a result, they do not fulfill either function particularly well."
4.0,It is just a little short. Still a nice belt I think.
4.0,Too early to tell how well they will work but looks good so far.
4.0,"These are heavier than other earrings I've ordered from Chuvora, heavy enough that I probably won't wear them. They are lovely though."
4.0,It fit somewhat small but thanks to previous reviews that where telling it. So I have order the size that usually is on my higher part of my range size.<br />Seller is very nice managing your request if problem.
4.0,"Cute, but made for size 6"
4.0,I only got these today and have tried them on but compared to 8.5 2 pair of Cole Haun shoes (also synthetic but very expensive) and these feel wider and better fit than the Cole Haun. I plan to probably return the Cole Haun but I see that in the 9 in the Cole it is $170 for synthetics!!  No way!!.  I just want to mention these fit better. I do have a wider foot but wide is too bit for me usually. So I imagine these run a little wide as compared to the other brand.
4.0,"we're talking shoelaces, not shoes"
4.0,This is very comfy & well made. I bought larger size to allow shrinkage. It shrunk down to just a little snug. I like lots of room in nightqowns. My next purchase will be a size larger<br />Addtition to review.  Didnt realize how expensive this is until i went to reorder. I think i will try something less expensive if i can. Otherwise I'll be back.
4.0,"I will say that this is a nice skirt. It is has flow to it. However, I am 6ft 1in, and I had asked previous customers if they thought this would be floor lenth on me. They thought it might, so I purchased it. However, it hits a tad bit above my ankle so it is not long enough for me. But this is a nice item and if your shorter, go for it. I think you would be satisfied with your purchase. Not for us taller gals unfortunately."
4.0,"A little bigger than I thought, but works great to hold alot"
4.0,"Works great as a replacement strap for my Gear S2.  Trims easily.  The deployment buckle is a bit cheap, but seems secure enough.  I love the &#34;Pirelli&#34; look to the band.  The band itself is made of very strong durable rubber.  Even came with 4 extra 20mm pins."
4.0,Just as pictured.... loved it
4.0,"I like it a lot, I got the large and it runs kinda small I am a size 12 gal, almost athletic built. Thou it keeps the girls n place if you jog (which I don't) I use it for work out lifting weights it feels too tight. I will get xtra large next time."
4.0,Kool summer hat. Seems well made
4.0,Size runs big so order down for a better fit.
4.0,Ordered 14-16 socks but they are tight on my wide feet
4.0,"I bought this along with several other inexpensive pieces of jewelry just to give away to my lady barber, hairdresser, nieces, grand nieces, and female friends just to make them happy.  They came fairly quickly and look very nice.  They did not come in any special boxes or other nice presentation bags or anything like that, but for the price I believe they are worth it.  I am satisfied with this particular anklet and will be giving it to someone very nice."
4.0,seemed small but adorable
4.0,The only thing I would of prefer is that the time would be inside with the handles instead of the glass surface.
4.0,The elastic bands that you wear on your finger were too small. I had to sew on different elastic for a more comfortable fit. Very cute costume. My 9 year old daughter wore these and got lots of compliments.
4.0,This was a gift for my grandson who is going to Homecoming.  He said that it was difficult to tie but finally got the hang of it watching a You tube video.
4.0,"This turned out just like the picture! Very beautiful and I would recommend it if you are going for that &#34;sexy&#34; look:) Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was a little too big (not significantly) and a bit hard to tie, but soooo worth it!"
4.0,Great product but shipping time was way too long. It took a full month to arrive!
4.0,"Bought these for my son while he was potty training. The fun prints had him excited to pick out his underwear every morning. They dont seem to ride up uncomfortably and they're soft. My son is 37"" and 35lbs with a 21"" waist.  The 2-4 yr size fits okay. They're not long boxer briefs and fit more like short boxers in the legs. If he runs around all day in them and sits splay legged in them at all with no pants on, he might as well not wear underwear at all. You can see everything. Keep that in mind if your kid hates pants like mine does some days."
4.0,"I wear these under board shorts to help hold everything in place.  They're surprisingly comfortable, even after moving around a lot.  For example, I had them on for a 4 mile bike ride last weekend.  They didn't ride up, and I didn't even really have to readjust them when I got off my bike.  The only real complaint I have is that &#34;quick dry&#34; is a bit of a misnomer.  They tend to stay wet quite a bit longer than the shorts I'm wearing over them."
4.0,It was cute but it didnt look as shiny as my other gold jewlery and it was heavy on my ear I could on wear it for maybe 30 mins at time without my ear getting sore
4.0,I want legit red sunglass but obviously i need to raise my price point üòÇ<br />These are costume glasses and are great for using as a costume accessory.
4.0,"It's SO cute but, sadly, my phone does not fit inside. My phone is similar size to the bigger iPhone. Super bummed because it is so pretty."
4.0,"They are very comfortable. Wish they had half sizes, but still fit."
4.0,"Super cute, took away a star because they are not double sided."
4.0,"It's a little big for my needs, but the color and styling are gorgeous for fall. Beautiful color too."
4.0,"Not 2"". The straps are 1 1/2"" in width. I wanted 2"" however I do like the texture and colors."
4.0,"The scarf arrived a shade of washed denim, nearly periwinkle, despite ordering a grey color. Sheer,  and light, needing an instant washing because it smelt like mold. Washed up well,  isn't so stiff any more,  and the color suits my eyes even tho it isn't what I was expecting"
4.0,"It's too small and I ordered up. It's like a short sleeve cardigan. I'm still going to wear it over a slim black dress though even though I can't really close the top and it hits just below my hips, not at the knees like the pictures shows. I'm thinking it will still be cute."
4.0,My wife gives them a 4 star rating because they face the same direction; she says one should go the opposite direction.
4.0,"Good belt, simple design.  Like that it isn't reversible; a feature that is far too common and leads to far too many broken belts in my opinion."
4.0,"Good socks, pills a lot, though"
4.0,It did seem a bit light and I am not sure how it will hold up but since it was a gift I can only say that it looked nice.
4.0,It's because of my body that it's somewhat small not because of the actual dress. But the material is really nice for the price. And the flowers are vivid
4.0,"The jacket fits surprisingly well (I wear a US size Medium), has a nice hood, and is fairly comfortable.  The only problem is it doesn't have a lining, so you need to wear a sweater underneath, and it doesn't have the air vents one would expect in a ski jacket.  But it should work very well as protection against the elements in general, or perhaps as a boat jacket.<br /><br />Oh, and it looks better in person.  The advertised picture makes it look a bit strange."
4.0,Torso was on the short side but overall great suit. I love the underwire for the girls.
4.0,I purchased this for adding to my work ID holder so that I can get into the doors that I need to get into.  The top part is a little bigger then the opening on my wallet (the wallet is a DANGO).  I wish it was just a little thinner.  It does do a good job though.  I like that it is sleek and and easy to hold.  I like that it is short enough that it does get in the way of the rest of the work that I am doing..
4.0,"This strap is very good looking and excellent quality for it's price point. It's just long enough for my 8.5"" wrist. The hardware is decent quality also. Pleasantly surprised considering how little it cost. No reservations on purchasing from this strap maker."
4.0,they arrived quickly and looked like the photo!<br />the quality looks good.  Will make a nice gift for the holidays
4.0,"The fit for a XXL is a bit smaller than expected. Otherwise, it's very comfortable."
4.0,It is very pretty and a little lighter than I expected it to be but it is a neat piece
4.0,Bands are a bit wide. Otherwise great.
4.0,"Too short.  I bought 3XL because I'm a 6' 0"" height man 230 pounds ....<br />I love the snap buttons, the quality and freshness of the cloth and the quantity of bags but it's TOO SHORT."
4.0,"Love the material, style and mostly the pockets.<br />Ordered a medium because I‚Äôm probably a size 7 but will order more in size larger"
4.0,"Had some sizing issues early but returned it for different size without problems.  Hat fits comfortably.  I was concerned about soaking it. However I used it fly fishing and the wind blew it off my head and into the river. So, I grabbed it and decided to thoroughly soak it. After letting the excess water drain off, I put it back on. It cooled me off immediately but didn't seem to last long.  Some previous reviews mention the perforation issues and I agree with those. I wish they had removed the hanging chads as they tend to block the airflow. I'll probably spend time with fingernail clippers or something to remove the punched hole chads. The hat DID retain its shape and size after soaking though. I was definitely glad to see that. I'll have a better appreciation for it when the weather warms back up and I put it to the test of the golf course."
4.0,"Overall, this isn‚Äôt a bad romper for the price. The sleeves eat much wider and longer than I expected them to be, but that‚Äôs my biggest complaint. Fabric isn‚Äôt paper thin, feels pretty comfortable, fits well. Cute for the summer."
4.0,Nice shirt. Made and fits well. A bit pricey.
4.0,Love them nice fitting no stretching after wash
4.0,"These shirts are the perfect amount of tight for a undershirt, I'm 6'5 320 and the 3xl is a perfect fit!"
4.0,The bottoms fit as expected but the cups for the bra top are too large and I needed to have them taken in. Still love it.
4.0,"This dress is very nice the quality was very good! I ordered a small because all the reviews said it was ran small, but I should have ordered an XS. I have a 27 inch waist and it was about 1 inch big around the waist. Also, the hem line seemed uneven but VERY slightly. Not noticeable until I put the crinoline underneath.<br />The belt it comes with is one size and it was HUGE. I used a different belt with it and threw the one it came with out.<br />I really like this dress for casual wear and for the price it was a smart buy. I would definitely buy another one."
4.0,These socks fit great and but the quality is a little less than expected.  I have about 2 or 3 pair that have holes in them from only wearing them 2 or 3 times.  Otherwise the socks are great.  They do not slip off the back of my heel and the color options are nice.
4.0,These are nice gloves.  Nice quality while price makes them affordable to buy in large numbers.  The fit will work for<br />a variety of hand sizes without being uncomfortable.
4.0,Nice socks Andover warm!
4.0,"I love it, looks great except i wish it came with the alligator swivel clip instead of the stationary clip."
4.0,It is not all that easy to get into unless you cut the Lace's out of the V neck.  It makes it so much easier to get into. Also my wife has to wear it with a thong or it doesn't look right because it is form fitting and see through.
4.0,Color wasn't too good but it'll do
4.0,"These were a bit thinner than I was looking for. My daughter says that they are very comfortable. I feel they are snugger than her other shorts, so if you want them loser, buy a size bigger than you normally would. Otherwise, I'm relatively pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"This shirt is super cute, looked great paired with jeans and booties. Should also look nice dressed up with slacks and heels, will get quite a few wears out of it. Only issue was the excessive threads hanging but I simply cut them off."
4.0,"The illumination of this watch at night is just as described, very bright. Whether it actually lasts for 25 years, that remains to be seen. The watch is well built, and the accuracy is impressive (approximately 7 seconds slow after 1 month).<br />The only reason I give this watch 4 stars instead of 5, is the second hand alignment. The second hand does not always line up with the minute marks on the face of the watch. I have a Citizen watch for half the price where the second hand lines up with the minute marks on the face of the watch every time.<br />For the amount Luminox charges for their watches, and the fact that they are Swiss made, I expected a little more precision out of them."
4.0,I usually wear medium ordered med but wish I got large
4.0,My son is tall and slim.  I wish they were a little  longer and tighter in the waist.  They are a little short on him and the waist is very loose.  We could not go up a size because the waist would be even larger.
4.0,"Great fitting glove if you order a size up. I did have the zipper come off of one of them, but I was able to get it back on."
4.0,This is a very cute t-shirt.  It comes with different parts of the face and allows you to stick it anywhere on the face part of the t-shirt.  Very creative.
4.0,The product may be fine for older kids but my younger child said it slipped and wouldn‚Äôt quite stay on.
4.0,My sons teacher retired this year and lived this
4.0,Very good sock. Not much ‚Äúcushion ‚Äú there. Just your average thickness to me.
4.0,Nice except slight color change on finger if gotten wet
4.0,Great for really keeping the sun off our face. Longer bill than most visors.<br />Only drawback is the white band lining will be hard to clean.
4.0,"I bought this dress to feel sexy on my first weekend away from my 14 month old son. So my body isn‚Äôt totally back and I look for looser sexy styles. This dress is amazing. Let‚Äôs be real for a second, it‚Äôs cheap, this isn‚Äôt some designer dress. It might get one wear out of it but I‚Äôll look hot for that one time. It‚Äôs very flattering!"
4.0,Love it Fits my body so beautiful and the material is very good only thing is I don't like is that it's long
4.0,These wash well and are affordable! Pleased with my purchase. Only complaint is that they could be slightly heavier weight fabric for winter!
4.0,I love the product. Fits great doesn't seem like cheap material. Took over a month to get it after Amazon messed up but I finally got it.
4.0,Pretty mask and functional.  But it‚Äôs extremely hard to breath out of.  There are times I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm losing air from how thick it is.  Aside from that it works Atleast.
4.0,The metal is quite hard to adjust. The bracelet looks good though.
4.0,My little cousin is turning 6 years old and she going to love it. Only thing I'm upset about is that when I got it the Ziploc bag was open and one of the wristbands are missing so it came with 1 and not 2
4.0,"Very nice, I just wish it had only one keeper bar, 2 is just stupid."
4.0,This is a beautiful dress!  Unfortunately too much boob action going on so i returned. Other than that awesome party dress
4.0,"I have wanted to order this for months and have been looking for a bigger size so that if would be more oversized but there aren‚Äôt any that are as cute as this one in a bigger size so I went ahead and ordered it. It‚Äôs a little short through the torso, I usually fit in a large but prefer clothes bigger so I buy an XL. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù & around 190 for reference. It gives me a bit of a wedgie but I love it and will be keeping it."
4.0,Still waiting can't wait to get
4.0,Nice but small. Order a larger size
4.0,"My teen age daughter loves it.  definitely not a piece of quality , but for costume jewelry, it is great."
4.0,Nice bracelet easy to put on
4.0,"A little difficult to get in, did make me bleed a bit, but it looks great and I can barely feel it!"
4.0,My wife loves it. Cute earrings
4.0,perfect!!! I'm so glad i risked it. it was on sale so it was worth it. very cute exactly what I was looking for! came with every spike. it was very tight so make sure to loosen it with pliers and be careful with putting it in because the spikes are really really sharp. wish it came with extra spikes cuz they will fall off
4.0,"I like this tee shirt because it is a loose fit, and I can wear it without a sweater or jacket."
4.0,"Nice gloves, delivery took longer than expected! They fit as expected the material is decent."
4.0,"Very surprised by the quality of the fabric for this price point, very soft. I normally wear a large in about everything, this large was too big in the chest.  I altered it myself but if ordered again would get a medium."
4.0,If you are like me and have to constantly wear your watch day in and day out I recommend these breathable elastic bands! They are easy to put on and off and Easy to clean! A must have for your Fitbit !
4.0,"I really loved the super soft, comfortable and thick material of this shirt-dress, but the dark green/blue color is too washed out and drab looking. Which may work for others, but I wanted tones that are more neutral or cheerful. The shirt-dress comes with a tie-sash belt that you can use/wear and place either high (empire-waist) or low waist. The cut is loose and very forgiving and the collar gives it nice structure, so you can buy your regular size or size up for a more slouch/draping look. Sleeves are about 3/4 length or so and you won't need to fold them up. I also bought the khakhi color/version and will likely keep that instead, since it is more neutral."
4.0,Very comfortable!!! Look like real jeans. They are true to size.
4.0,"Recieved in good shape. I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loved it. Thanks so much!!!"
4.0,This dress was for my sister she loved it but there was a piece of fabric in the back of the dress that she wasn't sure what to do with it. Over all a very nice dresd
4.0,I love the style. They fit great. The lenses themselves would have been better if they did not cause the scenery I am looking at to blur just a bit.
4.0,The legs are about 6 to 8 inches too long or I have shrunk a lot.
4.0,"Item is of expected size and quality. Fake/PU leather and felt covered cardboard that holds three pairs of eye glasses with two snap button closure. Is too small for jumbo sunglasses.<br /><br />Was shipped in a Amazon bag, was either sat on or smashed in transit. Was able to straiten to a mildly acceptable condition."
4.0,Everything I expected. Helps keep my contacts and glasses safe.
4.0,"I bought this for my niece and she LOVED it. The color in the picture was a little washed out, but very fun overall!"
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô 4.5‚Äù (shirt legs, long waist) and they are a little long on me. They reach the ground when I put the band around my waist.  I can hike the waistband up higher and then I don‚Äôt step on it. Hangs nice and the pockets are great."
4.0,Nice little cross body purse. Color is really nice not too bright at all. Rose gold zippers are good against the burgundy pink color
4.0,"Got this for my wife. She would have loved it, but it was not large enough, although she normally does fir in large clothing.<br /><br />Therefore, since it is so nice looking, four stars out of five."
4.0,"I really like this ring! My only issue is that when I get hot and my skin puffs a little, the band squeezes me a bit and it's uncomfortable. I probably just have to stretch it out over time. I got it for when I'm active or traveling and don't want to lose my actual ring! A stylish option."
4.0,Ordered a Large it fits pretty true to size only wish it was a little longer in length. Good quality material. Thick not see through at all. Got several compliments at work.
4.0,"I was really excited to get this ring because it was supposed to flow in the dark. It didn't arrive in the cool little bags my other qalo rings did and it does not glow in the dark. It's comfortable enough, but I'm over all disappointed."
4.0,"very cute, but my daughter would not wear so wanted to return. Will try to re-sale."
4.0,"The only issue that I have with this dress is how wide it is. I order my normal size according to the sizing information but I feel that the cut is a bit loose. I would like the dress to be a more form fitting at the waist. The picture looks like it should be more form fitting but it is loose. Overall, I do like the style of the dress. it is a bit short for my taste, so I wear it with leggings. I view it more like a long tunic than a dress. I however knew that before I bought it based on the product specifications."
4.0,"I liked these!  Followed the sizing chart, but too big/loose when I got them, and I need a lot more support.  Of you do too, go down a size."
4.0,Adorable but the strap that holds the band closed slips off easily making it easier to have it fall off of your wrist! The band is a bit stiff too which can become a little uncomfortable after a while.
4.0,"We purchased these compression socks for our son, who is a college athlete with severe shin splints.  He has had them for about 2 weeks now and he said they seem to help him.  One of his teammates recommended them.  He is 6&#34;0' and weighs 180 lbs.  I ordered the size large for him and they fit him perfectly.  I am planning to purchase a second pair for him."
4.0,Love it really soft and comfortable just a tad bit too tight but holds up in washer and is very nice material
4.0,It's a good band.
4.0,Great material fits perfect.
4.0,"These are Really nice, however they rise up on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 4‚Äù and 171, athletic build. I assume when I‚Äôm my normal weight of 154/160 they‚Äôll won‚Äôt rise up."
4.0,The hat ran a little bigger than expected. I returned the items and they rectified the matter as quickly as possible.
4.0,"These bands are great and love how they fit and feel. The pins fall out though, so be careful when swapping bands."
4.0,Very cute just know the apricot is yellow not as beige as shown in picture. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù 133 pounds a s small fits great.
4.0,"Love them they do turn the skin green after a while and the gold does fade after wearing for a long time, really cute earring"
4.0,"The one broke, but luckily we were able to fix it."
4.0,Looks just like the picture. It arrived quickly and I gave it as a gift
4.0,"Love this infinity scarf! Good price for a trendy item that looks great with a chunky sweater, leggings, and boots!"
4.0,Nice and cute swimsuit! I paired it as a top with jeans and it looked fab.Only thing I didnt like was the center slit opening everytime i sat down.
4.0,Looked just like the photo.
4.0,Good product.  Delivery takes some time
4.0,"I usually wear a bra in a size 38D, but they did not have that available so I ordered these in a 36DD.<br />I fully expected the band around the rib cage to be super tight when I tried them on, they were not too tight at all.<br />The bras are beautiful and as expressed in other reviews, they do indeed run small.<br />The fact that I normally wear a 38D meant that the 36DD would be larger in the cup, and smaller around the ribs. These  run small enough that the 36DD actually fit more like a 38C+, or something like that.<br />I would have kept these bras because the band around the rib cage actually fit pretty good, but the bras are heavily padded. Especially on the lower part of the cup, and that that acts like a push-up bra.<br />So if you're in the market for that sort of thing, these are amazing. Just order the cup size bigger than you might expect.<br />I have to return these because there's no way that I can wear a heavy padded bra... and what a shame because this was a really amazing deal.<br />The cup fabric is not silky, but more like cotton knit."
4.0,"The material is SO SOFT! But the size runs small. It's long enough, but not nearly wide enough."
4.0,A bit loose but not oh well
4.0,i wear it witha different chain i have for around my neck but i thought it was a ring to wear on my hands so a little disappointed but happy i had something i can fidget with at work !
4.0,"Love them, but after three rides they are showing signs of wearing."
4.0,Had to remove two 3 links but after that if fits super snug! And so far it looks good. I'm just concerned that within a few months the black plating might rub off<br /><br />Will update if it does
4.0,"Took a couple tries to get the right size but i settled on a large and I thought it fit me great. This is good material for a Halloween costume, but I do think it‚Äôs a little disproportionate (slit in the front too high & the back end too long). I also didn‚Äôt really like the open hole in the back right where the bra is, but luckily the wig mostly covered it. The cloak was thick and kept me warm when we were outside."
4.0,"This bracelet is very beautiful, and of good quality.  My only issue with it is the wrap around part isn't symmetrical so it seems like it might fall off my wrist."
4.0,"I was surprised with the quality and feel of the scarf for the price I paid.  It is a very thin material so could be great for all seasons, but wouldn't provide much if any protection in winter.  It is a great size and silky feeling."
4.0,"This is my favorite winter coat. I only have one negative comment and a point of feedback - otherwise it‚Äôs fantastic.<br /><br />I‚Äôve been wearing it almost exclusively this winter and I took it camping in 23 degree weather with a windchill that brought the temperature to 15. Feedback on that below.<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like<br />- the Velcro at the wrist of the right hand wasn‚Äôt sewn on properly and actually sits off the sleeve which scratches my wrist. It‚Äôs a stiff Velcro and with my dry skin, it‚Äôs actually scratched hard enough to bleed (like a paper cut from cardboard).<br />- the on/off/setting change button in where a left breast pocket on a shirt would be. While it looks cool, I prefer the button to be on a sleeve or on the bottom side of the garment because it is blinding at night when there is no other light (bonfires, camping, etc.).<br />- the zippers are cheap. I haven‚Äôt had problems with them yet, but for sure it will be the first part to break.<br /><br />What is outstanding<br />- it‚Äôs super roomy and true to size. I knew it was going to be loose on me when I ordered because I‚Äôm 130 pounds with measurements of 36-27-37. This was proved to be an asset because I can layer as much as I want beneath and on top. While camping I went between a tank top, a sweater and a flannel button down beneath. When the temperatures dropped beneath 30 F with the biting wind, I added a long puffy coat over it with two sets of gloves and an hat and I was comfortable. Without the wind even with the temps between 30-42 degrees F, I didn‚Äôt need a second coat.<br /><br />I wear around town wearing anything from a tank top to a chunky sweater or a long sleeve and a vest. I‚Äôve washed a few times and there is a cap to go over the USB to protect it from the wash. The cap is actually connected, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing the small piece. The battery pack pocket is in the interior of the jacket and zips closed.<br />- the hand pockets are spacious and zip closed. The jacket zips all the way to the neck.<br />- the jacket is lightweight, which is great because the battery pack is heavy<br />- I get about 4 hours on the high setting, and other two settings last 5/6 hours on medium and 7+ on low. It‚Äôs easy to know what setting you‚Äôre on by the color of the power button (red is hot, blue is cool and white is the middle temp.).<br />- the battery pack works well and chargers within 2-3 hours. One of my dogs gnawed on it and dragged it into the campground and it still works - bonus.<br />- there is Velcro on the arm so you can place a patch there. It comes with an American flag but I‚Äôve had fun swapping out with my other Velcro patches.<br /><br />I‚Äôm really happy with this jacket. I get questions about it almost everywhere I go, so be prepared to answer questions about it. The heat element only works on the trunk so if you<br />Need a jacket that warms your neck, this is not for you. I am concerned about the longevity of the zippers, but I like it so much, I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôll replace the zippers so long as the jacket still takes a battery charge."
4.0,My son is 6 and I got him a kid size 1. Fits perfectly. The slippers are very cozy. The only thing is it is a bit heavy on bottom. But it is non slippery.
4.0,"These shorts are just what I expected.  They fit perfectly, and the padding is adequate for may needs.  I'm not a distance biker, and confine my rides to 20 miles or less.  No padded short will take away discomfort completely, but these definitely make my rides more enjoyable.  The legs do not ride up.  The length is about as shown in the photo, and that is what I wanted because I wear these under long pants or bermudas (spandex is not my best look).  I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,Good band for the value. I thought that the actual band turned out to be darker than the image on the site.
4.0,"These are so fun to use, I s/p nearly everything now just for the fun of using them! Originally bought for our camper (steady base) but the set now lives on our kitchen table."
4.0,Great looking bag but a little on the thin side so it's a bit hard to pack with more than just the bare essentials.
4.0,Very cute. Cheap fabric. Ran big on me.
4.0,Nice does the job
4.0,Great looking glasses.
4.0,"Runs a bit small so order up. It is also very thin and see through. Great weight for summer,, but I think I will have to wear a bra tank under it."
4.0,Nice hat. Appears to be well made.
4.0,Very high grade material an real stitching of the Stones tongue.
4.0,"This is a well made mask, comfortable, effective,  and comes as advertised with one exception. The description says ""Made in USa."" In fact, this product ships from communist China. I believe in truth in advertising and only bought the mask because I thought it was of domestic manufacture. It is of sufficient quality and is otherwise as advertised."
4.0,"I loved the colors in this dress and was so excited to finally get it.  I ordered my usual size but it was too tight.  The arms are cut very tight for big arms, the bodice was snug, the body was narrow, but the length was perfect.  I really wanted this dress, I guess I'll give it away."
4.0,Love All this companies products.<br />These were however a shiny material.<br />Too shiny for me.<br />But all my yoga pants bought here are all favorites.
4.0,Toooo cute!
4.0,"A little loose, but nice"
4.0,Adorable top and very comfy material
4.0,"I love this skirt! The only bad thing is the bottom has become a little frayed, but it‚Äôs easy to cut off the fly away strings. I only wash it on cold and I hang it to dry."
4.0,Loved the dresses. Fit great. Only reason i returned was there was no stretch at all. Otherwise i would have kept.  Not many buys that the bust is a perfect flattering fit.
4.0,I liked the lightweight fabric and cool slit but sizing was small...do size up
4.0,I got medium in jumper suit romper and it‚Äôs very comfortable.
4.0,"This hat will be good to keep the sun off my face, but it isn't as nice looking as I hoped. It was a bit rumpled looking as received. I am hoping I can iron out some of the wrinkles. I had to do a bit of adjusting to get it big enough for my head. There is an adjustable tie on the outside but there is also an adjustable ribbon tie inside the lining that you need to loosen as well. The brim is wired making it somewhat adjustable. It is hard to get it just right, though. I really like that it has an optional chin strap in case it gets windy."
4.0,"Kinda small , should have ordered one size up"
4.0,Not very high quality
4.0,"Just like the picture, just very simple and basic for the pool or beach."
4.0,"Functional, but about as shiny as can be.  It's seriously shiny, like I'm at a disco or something."
4.0,Don't buy unless you're planning to use it as beachwear. The other colors are nice and NOT see-through.
4.0,La talla no queda como esperaba.
4.0,"RUNS SMALL, GET A SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU WEAR. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SHOES BUT CAPEZIO DOES NOT MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TOO..."
4.0,"I bought these for a friend who's getting ready to celebrate a birthday. Sure hope she likes them. If she does, I'll come back and add another star.<br /><br />Some years back, I gave another friend a similar set of earrings and she absolutely loved them.<br /><br />They're novel and draw attention. (Any of y'all know a lady that doesn't like to draw attention?)<br /><br />The quality and workmanship is very good and the chimes sound great.<br /><br />I also appreciated the prompt handling and shipping of my order."
4.0,Fits a little on the small side but it is very colorful and pretty
4.0,"He fit was good.  Once washed, parts of the hem came out."
4.0,"These gloves are fairly think so anything much below freezing and they probably wouldn't be heavy enough. But for less chilly days, they're good and I can use my phone no problem."
4.0,A little wider than I thought but very nice.
4.0,"Very comfortable fit, great eye protection and look like they cost much more.  I'm terrible with eyeglasses and this is a perfect solution at a great price."
4.0,They are good so far
4.0,"This is pretty dress and very comfortable. The dress is actually a Rayon and Spandex blend, NOT Polyester and spandex. I ordered two of these dresses... this one was more of a &#34;jersey&#34; material. It is very clingy. It is a bit short but I could make it work. The color is beautiful, I just need to decide if it will work for my maternity photos. the clingyness makes me feel like I need to wear support hose... It shows all of my insecurities about my pregnant body, and I am not a large person to begin with. I ordered a Medium and it was a pretty good fit. I am 5'5' and currently 31 weeks pregnant, 155 lbs."
4.0,I like it but need one size larger.
4.0,"This mask looks awesome. I used it for my batgirl costume and got so many compliments. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because of the poor quality of the ribbon. I only wore the mask twice; once for a Halloween party the weekend before Halloween and a second time to work on the day of Halloween. After just the first use the ribbon started to fray, and by the end of Halloween day it only got worse. If I use it again in the future I‚Äôll probably cut the ribbon off and replace it with something of better quality."
4.0,"it fits very well except for the length.<br />I bought a small petite and it's still too long.<br />I like the way the collar is designed.<br />It's a jersey shirt, not a regular shirt."
4.0,The size chart with this wasn't too helpful. The slippers fit my son but there's no room for growth. They are as advertised though and easy for my 4 year old to slide on.
4.0,"Gorgeous dress, but runs really small. Not just in one area either...the entire dress. So disappointed cause the dress is beautiful. I'm even wondering if it was just tagged incorrectly."
4.0,Much prettier than I thought it would be. Gyre at for holiday parties!!
4.0,"I find the mask a bit on the heavy side, but I like the replaceable filter and the one way exhaust ports. One problem I have is the nose clip interferes with my glasses."
4.0,"Like everything:  quality leather; well made; color.  Only drawback is where loop goes over charm, that metallic wire side slips on the bracelet, allowing loop to become big enough to slip off charm.  I am thinking of taking a pair of pliers and tightening up the metallic wire on that side to fix this."
4.0,"Bought for a friend. She said the quality seems good, but it's way larger than expected. Adorable print. I plan to buy one for my own baby.<br /><br />**Please click HELPFUL if you found my review informative or helpful. Thank you!**"
4.0,"A little thinner than i expected but still nice and warm, love it."
4.0,Good quality really cute and comfortable but definitely order a size or two up especially if you have a long torso. But other than that it's really cute. Definitely ordering more from this seller! I am going to have to return mine for a bigger size unfortunately but I really love it.
4.0,sexy and great feel wearing them during sex!!
4.0,It fits fine everywhere except that the waistband is much too tight.
4.0,Very comfortable for yoga
4.0,It's beautiful and warm! I loved it but a little large since Im petite and small! But other than that it looks elegent and had lots of compliments!
4.0,"Update: bought it twice because the first one fell off. The second one, same thing. The hoop is not secured enough so the Keychain just fell out without me knowing. That's too bad because the Keychain itself is well made. I would recommend switching it out to a stronger hoop<br /><br />I got this as a reminder for myself to always be the best version of myself. It's not too clunky but it's great quality. I love it."
4.0,"Beautiful and elegant, I just need litter adjusted on the back ."
4.0,"The clasp on the chain is a little flimsy, but overall I really like this piece!  It looks exactly as it does in the photo pictured in the item listing.  The individual stones are tiny, but I liked this design compared to some other styles I have seen for a chakra necklace.  The item arrived very quickly and I'm happy with the purchase - would recommend to anyone considering a chakra necklace."
4.0,"I loved the style of this bathing suit, although the fabric was a bit heavy. It did a great job at sucking in my tummy (new mom here)."
4.0,"I didn't realize it was purple, and a little unhappy with that, but will be more careful when I order again, to be sure I don't get the purple for the iPhone 8."
4.0,Colors are a bit brighter than shown.
4.0,Got my Dad this for Christmas and it made him smile. Very nice. :)
4.0,These are so soft!  Feel great. Only problem is size. I usually can wear a large that fits a little right or extra large that is very comfortable. These fit too large to walk/run in.
4.0,I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù / 38C. I odered the 14/16. This outfit was a hit. I got so many compliments. I would reinforce the seem at the zipper as I was busting out of the outfit by the end of the night from all the dancing I was doing.
4.0,"My first thought when I opened up the box it is shipped in was...I love how delicate this pendant looks! Its the perfect size for me and I love how intricate the tree design is.  The cord does feel a little scratchy against my skin but that could just be me.  Overall, its a very pretty piece."
4.0,Picked this up for the misses for 4th of July and I think it looks pretty good on her.  After reading the reviews we ordered a size up from what she normally wears.  The sizing runs a bit small. Looks very patriotic.  Seems to be of decent quality with no obvious issues that we have seen so far .This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,I'm a 14/16 and this was a bit tight. It's cute and a decent price though
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my mother. Overall she was happy with the dress & the shipping was fast. Only complaint is that the belt isn't the best quality and doesn't even fasten so it loosens too easy and will need to be switched out. Would recommend this shop!
4.0,"Light weight, linen feel.  So comfy.  it looks cute on me despite my pooch.  I am 5'4, 38-35-44.  Short torso.  Looks great with flats/flip flops or cute tennies!"
4.0,"Nice thermal top 100% cotton. I bought a medium and small. The small fits much better. 32 BUST, WAIST 26.<br />The fabric is sturdy yet soft. No heat stamp labels."
4.0,I got these to keep my feet warm during cold winter and they did a decent job.  Should have went a half size larger but they fit hood enough..  wish there was just a little more protection on the bottom of the shoe.  That seems to be the cold spot
4.0,"These are a little dressier than jeans.  Made well with a nice fabric. Fit as expected.  I'm 5'4"" and they are at least 2 inches too long, but that is normal for me."
4.0,"I gave these 4 stars beucase they are really cute, but they are entirely cheaply made. I've worn them a couple of times and they don't seem like they are going to fall apart, but the posts of the earrings are unfinished and kind of jagged so that when you put them in your ears they are rather rough going. Like I said, real cheap. But they are cute and they are not broken. If they break I will come back and update this review."
4.0,"I love this watch! Super cute and the band glows in the dark! Only issue is that the tides prediction isn‚Äôt accurate enough, it‚Äôs usually about 2 hours off or ahead."
4.0,These fit well and stay on your feet!  I've washed them several times now with no problems.  I would buy again.
4.0,"This didn't have a bad fit and it style was super cute. The material however, shed badly and although thick, you could see through it."
4.0,Comfortable and fits just as expected. Love these shorts.
4.0,"Super cute shirt, however, the color was not as expected. It was supposed to be pink instead it is more of a neon orange :("
4.0,This dress is really cute but the fabric is thicker than expected. Doesn't do much for the waistline. Overall a pretty good purchase though.
4.0,I like the pattern and the material is soft and wears well.  It is pretty thin so definitely a summer skirt.
4.0,"The sound is pretty good, even though wish there was a way to make the speakers get up against my ears. also the top of the hat seems a little big and floppy. but its worth it and I would buy again and recommend it. I will update if anything changes."
4.0,"Took 2 months to get in and was late for Christmas, however they refunded my money. The item showed up finally and my daughter loved it."
4.0,"I was so excited to get a pair of leggings in this light blue color since I've been debating somethibf other than black for a while. It's much lighter than I thought though for a light blue. I actually thought it was grey when I first opened the package! The pockets are great and I like the reflecting for running. While I would say the elastic right at the top feels secure, the fabric around my hips and booty feels very loose...you can see how the fabric wrinkles because it's too big size wise and I would say that I'm between a small and a medium size wise right now so I am pretty shocked. Fabric not see-through at all, definitely passes the squat test! Don't love the massive logo on the back but not the end of the world. Also I do like the key pocket at the front because it will hold an ID or credit card. Unfortunately, I will be returning these just because they feel too big and would probably drop with the weight of my phone while running. My biggest advice would be to size down or order two sizes to be sure!"
4.0,bought this for two of my interns and they loved it!
4.0,Band was easy to take on and off - but seemed to hold well. Band is a little stiff but will probably soften as I wear it. Overall a good purchase. I bought the navy and cream one and the black one also. Both are holding up fine.
4.0,"They are on the large side. I bought the same size as my t shirts and it‚Äôs baggy. Other compression shirts have been much more tight. If I was to buy again, I would go a size down."
4.0,Pretty good stuff
4.0,It's verry  nice but just smaller than expected
4.0,"The kids LOVED this as one of the party favors. However, the mom's, not as much. The strings aren't tied together inside the clasps very well, and they kept coming undone... at a pool party. It took forever to get them out of the pool."
4.0,"When it comes to winter, using phones is sometimes a hassle.  Having gloves that make it easier is a big plus.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These gloves are a gray color and are predominately wool.  There is 80% wool, and 20% polymide for stretch and strength.  The gloves are not tight, but on the looser side.  The fingers are a bit longer than usual, but they have pads on the thumb and first finger OF BOTH HANDS.  The description says rhinestones, but I would call it more like tiny marcasite studs instead.  That is a hematite looking color, not usually associated with rhinestones.<br /><br />MY GLOVE SIZE<br />My glove size is a medium to large women's.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />These are wool gloves.  If you have any sensitivities to wool at all, these might be a bit prickly.  They are not soft like merino, but more on the rough side.  They do soften up some with gentle hand washing especially when using a fabric softener for wool to soften them up a bit.<br /><br />The finger/thumb pads do work on phones, but because they are slightly longer (as in 1/4 inch) than gloves that usually fit me well, the pads can shift around a bit, making texting or phone/pad use challenging once in a while.  The gloves are medium warmth.  They are not for really cold frigid days, but they are better than no gloves at all.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For gloves that fit pretty well, especially if your fingers or finger nails are longer, these gloves are pretty nice.  They have pads on both thumbs and fingers and are definitely wool.  They are warm for cold weather, but perhaps not frigid weather.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I wish the pads were a little larger so that they did not slide around quite so much.  I like that these are REALLY wool instead of a tiny bit, though.  They are a lot warmer than synthetic gloves."
4.0,"works well, nice sized, good quality"
4.0,I would have given this top 5 stars but it smells weird and you have to hand wash cold. Ain't nobody got time for that! Still keeping it because it is cute. Hopefully when I get around to hand washing with cold water the smell will go away.  I am lazy so to me clothes that can get thrown into the washing machine are my friends. This one is like the needy friend you keep around because they do your homework for you.
4.0,Looks good even if it is state ..
4.0,They are really cute. I only just got them but they stay on nicely. No complaints.
4.0,"Quality is so so, is just ok for the price!  I am 5""7 and 145 pounds, I ordered SMALL. I would had ordered XS, but  It fits fine little loose as it looks in the picture.  The dress  falls right below of my ankle. It does not have  pockets tho, i thought had seen! Overall Great DRESS  for those hot summer days.!"
4.0,very nice necklace.was given as a gift.
4.0,Awesome...I was so happy that it fit so well!  True to size and very pretty!
4.0,"Very pleased with my purchase. Close up pictures don't do it justice. Much better looking and better quality once received.  As for sizing get a smaller size than you normally would the fabric stretches and stays stretched. There are many cheaper versions for exact item for sale on Amazon. I choose to pay more ad's buy from Bestyou because it was on Prime, which means easier return and refund. I decided to keep, perfect for covering my flawed thighs."
4.0,"Very cute, but shorter than expected!"
4.0,"I agree with the other reviewer that these shoes are difficult to get on. They seem to be comfortable for my son and they are cute and seem to be well made. My kids abuse shoes, so time will tell!"
4.0,"Very good quailty, although I thought the earring itself would be smaller"
4.0,I really like this jacket. It is super cute! It is very heavy. I have had to take it off each time I have worn it.
4.0,My son is 9 and weighs around 71 pounds. There were the perfect size for him - Medium.  Seem to be good quality but have not washed them yet!
4.0,"Absolutely love it! It is a bit rigid, but great item overall."
4.0,Nice feel to it.<br />Great foe a penguin lover
4.0,Small but so beautiful. They also have food energy.
4.0,"its cute and i like it, it is kinda cheaply made from the materials used but it is still cute."
4.0,It's cheap and it does the job of a stopwatch with minimum fuss.
4.0,"I really like this dress and plan to order more in different colors. Didn‚Äôt come with a tag, so I have to make sure it doesn‚Äôt go on backwards."
4.0,"I'm 5'2"" and a size 10-12 (ish). In the picture I am wearing 3"" wedges and this dress was still long on me. Since I am short maxi-dresses can be a little overwhelming on me. This one was borderline overwhelming, but I still liked it. It is surprisingly decent quality for the price and I like the 3/4"" sleeves as I find those to be flattering. Also, any dress with pockets is #winning! I like that it is one piece to make getting dressed simple. I think it's a bother to have to find a sweater or tank top if a dress doesn't have enough coverage, or to find a matching shirt for a skirt. I think for someone a little taller this dress would be a great option. I am between a med and large in most things and this fit fine in a medium. Definitely don't go up a size if you are in between. If you lean towards the smaller end of a size range, go smaller. I reviewed a few other dresses I bought this summer if you want to get some other ideas just look up my profile."
4.0,love the dress!!!
4.0,These are nice but doesn't fit my six and five year old. They did fit my 12 year old tho. She loves them.
4.0,Not the best fit but cute style. OK for price point. Size up!
4.0,"Got mine yesterday. I usually wear a large, but ordered an x-large after reading the reviews. Glad I did, it fits perfectly. The only complaint I have about it is the fabric is a little cheap. Other than that, I love it"
4.0,They don't show up your chest is most you arm but they look good
4.0,"I love the neutral color of this scarf. I also love the silky feel of it. I'm not a fan of wool or cotton scarves because they make me itch a lot, but with this scarf I'm totally fine. If you wear it certain way, you can even use it during the summer. My only issue is length. I expected it to be longer so I could wear it in different styles, but I could only wear it two ways."
4.0,"I like the shirt. It fits well and is comfortable to wear even when it's 90+ outside. It helps that it's a vented shirt that allows air to flow through it without looking like a bad 80's see-through. Only thing to note is that the reflective strips are raised. It's not a big deal, but I have on occasion tried to wipe my face with my shoulder sleeve and had a surprise when I ran the scratchy reflective part across my face."
4.0,"I'm a 30DD/ 32D so I have to be careful when I raise my arms in this top. The color is slightly see-through but I like how it looks. For the modest that are larger than a C cup, I highly suggest you go a size up. The material is soft and washes well."
4.0,"I have ordered one of this style and I&#60;m very happy size ordered 2xl. cotton materil smooth,nice design and confortable."
4.0,"It is adorable, but if you are prone to migraines have someone else open it outside and let the skirt air out for a bit. I get migraines bad, and I opened it in the house and by the time I got it hung up in the garage.  I had a bad migraine for several hours.  Once it aired out it was fine. It‚Äôs an adorable outfit and it will be cute on my daughter. The top you can just wash."
4.0,I would recommend this and I would like to thank the maker. It is the perfect size for my needs...
4.0,Great! Hard to take on & off.
4.0,Had to have my mom fix the collar. It was made to tight. Love the color.
4.0,Just received today and put it right on. It is longer than I expected which is great because others stop just under belly. You definitely get the coverage you want. From right under bust down to pelvic area. I will definitely be buying another and recommending to everyone.
4.0,Since this was purchased for a gift I cannot answer
4.0,"Item is picture perfect, very little to no variations"
4.0,"I bought the two pack in red and black in my normal size of small.  They fit slightly more snug than other small sized yoga pants, but not so bad that I can't wear them.  They are very stretchy and comfy.  A bit on the thin side if you're going to be outside in the cold.  The pockets are amazing!  Honestly the biggest complaint is that the black ones are a magnet for fuzz/cat hair.  I am assuming that they are the same material as the red ones, but they are almost immediately covered in fuzz.  I bought two packs, and each black pair are the same in regards to getting fuzzy.  The red ones do not attract and fuzz/hair at all."
4.0,I loved the way it looks super cute! The libra started tarnishing after a week had to return it.
4.0,Its durable. It's cutproof. Wouldn't say 100% theft proof
4.0,"These shoes are very pretty and actually really good quality. They fit really big on my daughter. The sizes can get confusing. What is a 2 little kid as opposed to a 2 big kid? I should have ordered a 2 little kid. I followed the measurements on the size chart.<br />Anyway, aside from the size, they smelled of paint when I took them out of the package. They were packed very well too. I‚Äôm going to reorder these in a smaller size."
4.0,"It's big enough for my laptop, cord, phone and charger, and a few journals and papers.  I wish it had an outside pocket and it'd be perfect.  Light and attractive, though, so def 4 stars."
4.0,The monogram is beautiful.  I get compliments from other woman on it all the time.  My only reason for not giving the product 5 stars is the price is a tad high and the chain is cheap looking.
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Nice fabric. Like the flouncy sleeves. Enjoying these vintage style Allegra K dresses. Bought several of them.  All have been quite cute so far, especially the shirt dress styles. Reminds me the 40's-early 50's dressss."
4.0,I like the mask considering I have to wear one daily.  I would definitely recommend wearing an internal filter with these.
4.0,I love the variety of styles included in the pack. I was able to share a few because there were so many! The price was so good I was worried about quality but they seem great and I'm pleased overall.
4.0,Was delivered on time. Attractive piece.
4.0,"These fit nice for someone who is short and round, not so sure if you were tall. Really soft fabric and comfortable to wear."
4.0,Great fix .. very roomy. I love the stretch
4.0,"Hello, My beautician suggested I purchase the Satin Lined caps to prevent hair breakage. Also, I‚Äôve worn them as a replacement for caps. ‚ù§Ô∏èthem!!"
4.0,Fits good however patches came off during washing
4.0,"The glasses are nice, they are not as wide to compliment the face as much as I would like so I would say the frame is narrow but they're still nice"
4.0,Bought three of these.  Excellent quality and fit.  They lost one star from me because the gray sweatshirt has a distinct vertical line in the pattern of flecks.  Just looks odd.  The maroon and the navy are perfect.
4.0,Was surprised by the quality. The are too short for me and basically end up being capris.
4.0,Very convenient and nice when going to the gym. In and out.
4.0,Maybe just a bit big.
4.0,Nice shirt I love it I need all color thanks
4.0,"I don't expect companies to make wet suits for petite people, so I shouldn't be surprised that it didn't fit properly. I'm 5'1"", about 120 lbs, so of course the length was too long. It looks good and fits ok, not great. Too bad you can't try it on in the water first!"
4.0,Super cute. Nice quality
4.0,I like that they are compression pants.
4.0,"i think it‚Äôs cute. broke when me and my friends were playing around, but it‚Äôs easy to fix."
4.0,"Now, I am no model... I don't even have the intended &#34;equipment,&#34; unless you count &#34;moobs&#34; but these run a solid size and a half small i.m.o. That said, they are so very pretty and feel wonderful on the skin. Judge my kink if you like but if you are  1x or smaller get every one of these you can but order a size up. If you are a true 2x like myself, the xxl will be tight enough to pop stitches if you so much as sneeze. I endeavor to become smaller so they will fit better."
4.0,Esta para la nieta de mi hermana pero no le quedaron
4.0,"Good, basic set of pins. Just be careful how you open it or you'll spend quite a while re-organizing them all."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for and more
4.0,If the boob portion was made bigger and the straps were thicker it would have gotten 5 stars
4.0,"I really like this, it is a little difficult to put on the Fitbit but I got it on ok. I have a small wrist so reading the reviews with people saying how small it ran I got the large and I'm glad I did, it was just a tad snug but has stretched out nicely. I really like it."
4.0,"Loved the various colors, however the silicone wasn't as smooth/slick finish as I would have preferred as a watch band; making it difficult to pull out of the slit for extra length of band. Only reason didn't give 5 star rating."
4.0,Very good quality. Durable only a small paint dot on the clear part
4.0,"Traditional Fleece hoodie, actually has some body to it."
4.0,"I bought my dress for $15 and I am happy with it. I am 5'2&#34; and about a size 6. I got a size small and it was a bit more loose fitting than I wanted but it's still very flattering. The fabric is kinda like a stretchy tablecloth and out of the bag, it was pretty stiff and wrinkled from being folded. I made the mistake of not even reading the washing care instructions and just threw it in the washer and put it in the dryer afterwards. This faded out the color a bit. Apparently this has to be handwashed and line dried. I had to iron it since it looked worse after I took it out of the dryer.<br /><br />It's a really adorable dress and I am satisfied with the quality for the cost. I am going to use this as a vintage costume but I will be putting this in my closet to add to my normal wardrobe."
4.0,I enjoy this beanie.
4.0,Some aren‚Äôt as sturdy as they should be
4.0,"This dress is even more beautiful in person but the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was there was no stretch at all in waist so you have to be precise with your measurements. The other thing was the corset back, you could not get into this dress without help which is a bummer. It has half zipper and half corset in the back I didn‚Äôt know that so hope this helps someone. Other than these minor setbacks this dress is a dream it is absolutely gorgeous. It‚Äôs very high quality and well made. The shine is even better in person. It really looks like it‚Äôs made of gold! I also love that you don‚Äôt have to wear a bra because it has it built in. I highly recommend this dress."
4.0,cThey are just as you expectedüòä Great price for highly quality sunglasses !
4.0,"Everyone falls victim to the sock thief so it's a pleasure to buy socks in bulk. Quality is kind of thin, but nobody wants hot feet so it does its job. Would buy again, since I'm sure my socks will magically disappear as always lol"
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter's birthday and she loved them...until she put them on. She was okay wearing them for a few minutes, but any longer than that and her ears would turn red, and start aching terribly! Perhaps they just weren't the right fit/size for my daughter? I gave this a 4/5 because they are absolutely stunning, and very well made! I would definitely love to try more earrings from this company."
4.0,"Luggage tag works as you would hope. Only complaints are that the color is not as bright has in the pictures. I got the ""Yellow Glaze"" thinking it would be a mustard yellow, but really it looks like a drab yellow leather color.  The flap doesn't really stay closed, but it made it back in one piece on its maiden voyage from Dallas to Baltimore and back."
4.0,"This turtle-neck sweater is one of the best looking and well-fitting garment of its type and price-range that I've come across in a long time. The slim-fit is flattering without being constricting, uncomfortable or looking as if the wearer is trying too hard to show off or get attention. Those of us with longer arms -- 34""-35"" in standard dress shirts in my case -- will appreciate that the sleeves on this sweater reach to the wrists and base of the hands so that we don't necessarily have to wear these sleeves pulled up to disguise an inadequate length. This sweater has a moderately heavy weight making it ideal for chilly Fall and Winter temperatures without a bulky look or feel thanks to that fitted cut. The material is of good quality as is the workmanship -- good seams, no dangling threats or other tell-tale signs of the low-grade garments that have flooded the market in recent years. Care instructions are straight-forward and easy as opposed to sweaters that require hand-washing and other protocols that make an everyday casual garment more bother than its worth to some of us. It arrived during the first days of Fall when the weather was still warm but I can already anticipate how well it will look when paired with a nice pair of dark jeans and some Chelsea boots for a classic, sleek and masculine look updated by its modern fit."
4.0,Very nice fitting dress and pretty color.  Good value. A bit on the short side just FYI.  Would recommend.
4.0,It's nice but turns wrist green. Unfortunately but I do like it.
4.0,"I love these. I walk 7 miles a day 6 days a week and sometimes the callus build up and become painful, once I I grind them down they are still sore and these provide enough cushion that I am pain free."
4.0,"These are nice rings for stacking, however just 1 by itself it is a bit too skinny for my liking and because of the silicone, it sometimes pinches my finger skin in between them, but nothing terrible, just a tad annoying.<br />I am used to a regular size womens wedding band and I use these when working out but, I will stack 2 together to get desired thickness of band, which I don't mind because the colors are cute.<br /><br />I consider this a great purchase...<br />Tania"
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute! The turtle neck part is the only tricky part to try to get it just right takes a few extra minutes but it‚Äôs so worth it! It‚Äôs a bit long on me and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 but wearing it with heeled booties makes it look just fine.
4.0,It‚Äôs a great suit but the pants were too small
4.0,"Wish they were a little longer, but they are okay. I will say that they do not feel like cashmere. Can't complain at this price point though."
4.0,"Bought the super expensive brand and these guys. No difference in performance. Two weeks on the Camino de Santiago and no blisters speaks for itself. In all honesty, though, I wouldn‚Äôt put them in the dryer again."
4.0,This is so comfortable and have received compliments.  However it shows too much cleavage.  I sewed the V neckline about 2 inches so I wouldn't be flashing people.  The material is polyester so is too warm for summer.  I am 5'2&#34; and wear shorts or leggings because this is very short.
4.0,I love this shirt but I do not like the sleeves in the upper arm area. A bit snug with very little give. Everywhere else is fine and tts.
4.0,Good sweatshirt for a very reasonable price. Not as heavy as I expected but still a good value.
4.0,"I was hoping they was a little longer, but I still like them a lot ."
4.0,"I am giving this 4 star instead of 5 simply because it is not as good as the first Taxi wallet I purchased 15 years ago that lasted until now. My original taxi wallet had a clear window on the back side that this one doesn't . It was great for either your drivers license or in my case I had my concealed weapon card in it. Also the leather isn't as thick on this wallet as on my original, but it could be that I had a black one and  maybe it was different type of leather, at any rate i love this style of wallet and am glad I purchased it."
4.0,Me. Gustaron mucho
4.0,"They will work BUT not flattering. Has nit tumny support whatsoever, spandex material us tight in thighs and does not hide your pants line at all. Disappointed. But need for summer walks."
4.0,He loved these glasses. Nose piece where bent but still nice.
4.0,Impressive quick delivery and the helmet is perfect! I totally enjoyed my ride!
4.0,I love these shoes. Assuming they hold up they are a great buy. Seem like good quality.
4.0,I'd give it a 5 but what kept final star was because the pants along the seams it ripping. They've had to be sown.  Otherwise they fit perfectly and are comfortable.
4.0,"I have been wearing women's panties for a while and the Shadowline Modern Brief panties are really good, the quality is excellent and the fabric is silky soft, but the gusset is a little narrow for a man. If the gusset were a little wider they would be my favorite panties. I like panties that have a high waist line the best, and these have that, I would recommend these."
4.0,We got the ‚Äúlace top and red short‚Äù for our daughter and she loves it. It is made of cotton and is ideal for summer. It is definitely fashionable and stylish. The shorts have an elastic waistband which makes it easy to keep it in place and for easy removal. We have washed it once and the color of the red shorts seems to be ok with no loss in quality. Remains to be seen how it works over the long run and multiple washes.<br /><br />Our daughter us 3 years old and if fist perfectly.
4.0,"good shirt, but see through."
4.0,"Shorts looked great and fabric had nice feel to it, I've worn a 36 waist for years so bought the XXL size and it was way too small, could barely get it past my hips and couldn't get the Velcro strips to close around the waist at all"
4.0,"A little smaller than anticipated but it works. I like that it has a convenient carrying handle, but the hanger hook is plastic however, and I feel it might've been more durable had it been metal. Hopefully it holds up!"
4.0,I bought these to use for working in my yard.
4.0,The romper is a little tighter than the dress but still fit well. I'm 5'5'' and 140lbs and fit a medium.
4.0,"Good price point. Not quite as comfortable, nor as exciting/fun as some other pairs I recently purchased. Although they are a little bit more expensive about 2 bucks more per pair, I like the brand Jinshi better. But if you want cheap no thrills, trunk style boxers, these are the way to go."
4.0,All the buttons came as expected and on time. Thank you so much!
4.0,"I am 5'3"" and 160lbs. I usually wear a size 12-14. I bought the L/XL leggings. I do have to say they are VERY comfortable and warm but I do have to do the wiggle to tug them back up now and then. I wish they came in one size bigger for a little better fit around the thighs.<br />But overall they are well made and comfy. I wear them to work under long shirts, sweaters and dresses and am not cold anymore."
4.0,"3.5 stars. Love the design of the shirt!<br /><br />I did size up and I'm glad I did. I usually wear a medium and I ordered a large. It's a nice loose fit, but not oversized.<br /><br />However, the graphic has already started to fade. I've washed on the hand wash cycle with cold water, inside out and hung to dry. But I guess for the price, you get what you pay for."
4.0,"These are lovely, have held up well and are a nice muted pink color, not nude as so many of the others are."
4.0,I ordered a 2xl. Knowing it was probably going to b big on me. When it came it was even bigger than I preferred. Should have gone with a large. Overall great pajamas. Worth the money
4.0,"These are a little large format daughter so it's hard to give a comfort review. They are cute, though! I like the little berry/leaf design. The straps seem sturdy. The sole is flexible and cushioned. I don't see any spots that stand out as causing irritation on wear. If the price is right and you like the style, I think these are worth a shot."
4.0,It's really beautiful. Thank you.
4.0,I am very pleased with this product! I like the fact that they are adjustable so I can adjust them to fit my face so that they won‚Äôt slip.
4.0,"These are SUPER comfy...like really comfy.  The sizing threw me off though, and I think it's the relaxed fit & I forgot that Terra & Sky is more of a 'true"" plus size fit.  I can typically wear a loose-fit 3x or a smaller 4x comfortably.  This 4x was REALLY big...like where they won't stay up on me.  I'm keeping them as lounge-around pants and gonna tie them a bit cause they're so comfy and I just don't wanna to the whole mail return thing.  Next time around I'd get either a 3x or maaaaybe even a 2x.  I think I forgot that Terra & Sky is pretty great with sizing, so don't feel you have to 'size up' to get these to fit!  :D (Did I mention they're super soft?!..ha)."
4.0,Everyone loved the dress on me I felt comfortable dress was soft feeling..only downfall is something rubbed against the dress unknown if it was there when I put it on or after but there are snags on the side of the dress due to the type of material.
4.0,I bout this as a gift for my nephew. I messed up thinking it was a youth not your fault this was my own. I still would have to say it arrived on time and was good quality. He loved it even though he had room to grow into it.
4.0,"It really is pretty and looks great. The only difference I noticed was that we bought our daughter a volleyball to add to her bracelet from the Pandora store and this soccer ball is slightly smaller than the &#34;real&#34; volleyball. For us, that is no issue because she is 10 and she really didn't pay attention or question it."
4.0,"I really needed a new pair of black boots. I absolutely LOVE these. I put them on as soon as they came in and they are very comfortable. I am so happy that I had a chance to get these at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />As much as I love these boots, I had to subtract one star because they smell horrible. When I opened the box, I was taken aback by the smell. These boots smell like a combination of a tire factory and a chemical plant. I had to put them outside in the sun for a few hours, but they still have a smell to them. Hopefully, that will go away before too long."
4.0,Not quite as good as the prior pair I bought (and then wore out I loved to wear them so much).  These are a bit tighter on the ankle seam which can get uncomfortable in time. Hoping after a few washings they will improve. Did not have that problem with the first pair.
4.0,"A button is a button. Did not really need to buy as there was nothing special. I thought is might have a shank to make sewing on the button to the jeans and heavy pants easier. No. Plain flat black button. So if you do not have a button jar, you buy....GrammaBoo"
4.0,"colors are great. a little flimsy, but they are just what i was looking for because i am<br />constantly losing my more expensive glasses. these are perfect for the beach or biking."
4.0,It was great my wife loved it
4.0,I mostly love this hat with speakers in it. My head do sweat in it which isn't all that bad. I would love a different color of hat than black like blue. Overall it's a very good hat to run or walk with.
4.0,If buying gloves for warmth  these are the ones for you
4.0,Love these masks. I always get compliments in them from men and women. They work great for going out or shopping. I tend to get anxious wearing a mask and this one allows me to breath and helps me. I have gone everywhere including the airport and plane and no one has said anything except Torrid at the mall.
4.0,"Kinda big. Shoulda checked the measurements against the matching  purse more carefully because, as the title states, this is a wallet AND purse. I might add little rings to the sides somehow and make it a reversible clutch/tiny shoulder purse. I could easily do this with a trip to a craft store and the matching hologram crossbody/shoulder strap that came with the KAISIBO Geometric Lattice purse and handbag (there aren't a lot of good ways to attach and use the long that came with the matching purse anyway)."
4.0,These tanks top shirts fit as expected
4.0,"These make my ass look great, very stretchy, were a bit big, veeeeeery thin! These will not keep you warm at all."
4.0,Bought it for my wife fits great
4.0,"as others have stated, it is small but it will work better for someone with a circle face. i have an oval face and it is somewhat uncomfortable. I had to cut the strap on the bottom also bc it was too tight. i plan to stretch it out before wearing"
4.0,comfortable material but on the thin side
4.0,It's a nice set and it's not real heavy.
4.0,Nice tie with good blend of colors. My only negative comment is that it's too narrow. Must be the new style.
4.0,These were much larger than I expected! Lots of room and seems strong enough! I'll be using them to strap a carseat onto a luggage bag! It seems like it would work perfect for that
4.0,"Bought this dress for graduation came a day earlier than expected . This is a super cute dress , nice breathable material,  a little bit tight in the chest area. Otherwise a great fit and I got a medium . I was wearing a really dark undergarment so it's understandable that it was  see through on the top portion . However my denim shorts were not . Overall great product !"
4.0,"Affordable and fun for me and my golfing friends. About 16 inch chain, I think."
4.0,"Cute, but they fall out of the magic band holes easily, especially on kids."
4.0,"My first bag and it's perfect,durable not to bulky and holds nice amount disc . Would recommend  to others."
4.0,"Very nice for the price, fit is a little snug for the size."
4.0,A little big for me but fun and nice quality
4.0,"This is just hilarious looking so I got it for a friend since the horse head became a part of everyday life. It came in such a little box i was confused but it‚Äôs because the latex is so flexible and thin but still detailed and sturdy. I mean it does smell of latex but...it‚Äôs latex. It‚Äôs kinda hard to see out of but I mean are you really wearing this to run errands? All around fun, comfy and worth the spur of the moment purchase."
4.0,"Ordered size small, fit true to size, like the pockets, but they do stick out a bit, happy with purchase."
4.0,Great material for this neck tie. I love it.
4.0,"I loved the colors, was disappointed that there was not a back for each earring."
4.0,"(Writing from my moms acc) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 135/140 pounds and bought a medium incase that‚Äôs helpful. It fits great! I‚Äôm pretty much happy with it except I have a normal sized ass and it still ripped when I bent over. It‚Äôs not a big deal for me I can just sew it up but it was certainly surprising. (Also it might give you a wedgie, it rides up a lot.) I‚Äôm happy with the material that the cape and body suit are made out of, after all you get what you pay for. It looks great and it‚Äôs my second ever cosplay so I‚Äôm happy! If it‚Äôs any bit warm where you live it‚Äôll be a bit itchy, I suggest baby powder on the inside of it. I live in the only cold part of WA right now so it‚Äôs not a problem for me but Ik the rest of the world is more than warm. I‚Äôd say go for it and buy it, you could always return it!"
4.0,fits tight but usable and do have extension
4.0,Nice top but runs small. I would recommend buying a size bigger
4.0,"Thes is a nice bangle bracelet, but the little stones is not shiny these why I give 4 stars . I wish little shinyer , the seller is not give the right accurate review"
4.0,"Very pretty dress, just like the picture, the only thing is that runs something big, I usually used M but in this case M is like a Large, so if u r M choose the size S !!"
4.0,It was a good fit but longer than expected. It shows above the knees but it was below them.
4.0,50% cotton<br />59% polyester
4.0,I do like these shorts but at times the outside layer seems a little too fluffy almost like a skirt. Great material though and extremely comfortable
4.0,Very happy with the replacement surge band for my Fitbit! It saved me money from having to buy a whole new Fitbit. Only giving it 4-stars because no instructions were included.
4.0,It is fine and good quality but it is smaller than the picture
4.0,puedes aplicar unas gotas de escencias  y lo llevas siempre contigo.
4.0,"Excellent craftsmanship, just the right size and not bulky. Only thing preventing a 5 star is the eye hole is too small to go on most types of necklace ropes or chains. But very happy overall"
4.0,Am 5' 3&#34; it rest at my knees. Nice material. Bought for my vacation in December.
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter after Arizona visit with us. She loves them.
4.0,Just a Lil too big for one year old
4.0,bought this watch for myself. have not used it but it seems to be just what i was wanting
4.0,Easy to wear beautiful color
4.0,"Fits loose. It is cute with leggings, I am short and it comes about mid thigh on me, I'm 5'1&#34;, my daughter is 5'4&#34; and it is still appropriate in length but much looser on her."
4.0,"This dress really is very beautiful. It was just what I was looking for except for the fact that it's a little too thin to be full coverage. Nonetheless, it's easy to throw a lightweight camisole under it and go. Very feminine. Love it!"
4.0,this is real bone carved by craftsmen the animal was not killed  for its bone it was used to give me something i feel connected to.<br />something that was once alive not made up.
4.0,Grandes y bonitos pero algunas se rompen
4.0,"These hat's will stretch out if you just pull at the draw string inside the back of the hat, I wear a size 7 1/4 size hat and Imade fit!"
4.0,My mom loves her bag it's roomy and fits all her stuff
4.0,"The dress is big in the chest but overall I am pleased. I love the flow of the bottom, the pockets and with the right bar think I can make the chest fit much better. Does come very wrinkled and smells like the bag. I sprayed the dress with water and hung it outside in the sun and wind."
4.0,"Was better quality then I expected, and the pearls are very pretty. The gems on the actual pendent aren‚Äôt great but still looks ok."
4.0,i really really really like tehse boots! i normally wear a 10.5 and i ordered a 11. they fit perfectly. the width is a touch narrow but i think they may break in a little with wear (fingers crossed). these seem to be well made also.
4.0,"I like the quality of the shirt, however the lineman emblem is placed to far from the left, it is a to close to my armpit"
4.0,"These were much smaller than I thought, but they looked really good when I wore them. Got some compliments and my boyfriend loved them."
4.0,"Cute and comfy! Initially, because of the pockets and construction the fit is slim through the hips but as you wear it throughout the day the fabric relaxes and stretches. I found it to fit true. I am a size 8 and ordered a medium. The dress is perfect for looking relaxed and cute. My mom thought it was so cute she ordered one too. I think it's a keeperüòéüòÅ"
4.0,"Not quite what I was expecting. The material kind of feels like a balloon. But, it fits and it will work (hopefully). Also, there's a design flaw that they didn't think through. The way the seam goes down the front causes of to look like you have a camel toe, even if you don't. Will definitely be wearing shorts with this."
4.0,"I‚Äôm,Ike the color and swing of dress as well as pockets, but the Medium is definitely not more than Size 8. It can only be washed by ha d, so that is a nuisance because the rayon knit takes a long time to dry. I will keep it despite the Less than true sizing because it is cheap and I can wear it as an around the house cool dress."
4.0,"This is a cute pendant, a nice size surprisingly as often they are smaller. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the back is hollow making this lighter than is my preference. The chain is good quality, a real chain, not like the cheap ones that are sometimes given when you buy a pendant. I like the color of the stone, anything with moonstone suits me perfectly."
4.0,Love these pants but they are a bit baggier than expected.
4.0,"Really nice dress, perfect fit, great quality."
4.0,Be prepared for very silky/puffy fabric!
4.0,Great socks for the price.
4.0,"Needed some comfortable work boots and this did the trick, and they look good too"
4.0,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review as part of the Amazon Vine Program. Seller the ITAY Belts Store lists this as ""Genuine Leather Travel Money Belt - Metal Free w/ Anti-Theft Hidden Money Pocket - Like a Funny Pack but a lot more Elegant"". A good sturdy money belt for safety and security of my cash & cards when traveling is a must have. This belt which I received in a 43 inch length fits as it should. The black leather is nicely finished. The belt's buckle and zipper are non-metallic (I believe nylon or another hard plastic) so I can go through a scanner without removing it, unless the authorities insist! The width needs to be greater - I can't fit my passport inside this belt, and a plastic credit card won't fit at all. The inner zippered compartment has no provision for expansion or to hold anything but tightly folded cash. Too bad... This severely limits its usefulness - minus 1 star.<br /><br />I can only give a Limited Recommendation to this ITAY Belts Store Genuine Leather Travel Money Belt for the reason stated. It is attractive and well made but in this day and age needs to have room for credit cards."
4.0,"It makes me feel chubby, but overall it fits well."
4.0,Very comfortable socks helped my arches. material is a little thin
4.0,Great quality and very cute!  Very soft pillow case used.
4.0,This is a beautiful sink!  Great price and totally unique to itself since it‚Äôs stone.<br />I only give it a 4 star because I wish it was about and inch deeper so the water didn‚Äôt splash as much.<br />Overall I love this look and very happy with my purchase.
4.0,So these are by no means &#34;nice&#34; high quality jewelry but for the price they are awesome! I switched the chain out for one of my own and ended up using the pendant in the bracelet to make a ring. The earrings are a bit more &#34;orby&#34; than I expected- for some reason I thought they would be flat. But still super pretty and nice vibrant colors!
4.0,I thought I ordered large but received an extra large. I am glad I got that size though it fits great...very sexxi just a slight difference on the color....other than thathat it's gorgeous.
4.0,I wanted to keep this but it didn‚Äôt fit
4.0,Works great for the price
4.0,"Great value for sunglasses with readers; no need to ""swap"" to be able to ready close up while keeping the sun out of your eyes.  Good style and value for the money, glasses fit very well, no wobbling."
4.0,"Such a cute and outfit for a special night. It was a lil bit weird the thong came with the back part like to move it like at the &#34;T&#34; part. Just weird...<br /><br />Besides that it is cute and playful too, I like it!"
4.0,These fit quite snug around the lower pocket. Length was great and are quite comfortable after that.
4.0,"It's definitely a throw back nylon mesh ball cap, which is cool.  I like it.  Hoo Hoo Hoosiers!"
4.0,"Update: Seller contacted me and provided options to replace the item. It also turned out that there was no ""gun metal"" color, it was just my impression by looking at the picture. Very good customer service.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Wrong color delivered. Size is smaller than advertised. 2.5D mirror is almost flat and look more curved on the picture than it is."
4.0,"cute shirt, looks just like the picture. only thing is i actually could have sized down.  the buttons on the shirt are a little loose, in hoping they don‚Äôt fall off."
4.0,light for summer... cute and I just took it up...  But we are all different on what we like on this kind of top and fit.. So I like it!
4.0,Not bad. For 40 bucks could be a little more defined when compared to the actual Sinn version but good enough
4.0,"I love the robe and was looking forward to get it but when it finally arrived the facial strap was missing and wanted to contact seller to see if I could get the facial strap instead of returning and start over. Unfortunately unable to contact seller and Amazon could only give me a refund. So, will order again and hopefully will get facial strap this time. Also, I ordered size large instead of medium based on reviews that it opens in the middle which I was hoping a bigger size won't do it but it did, so I'm going to add a Velcro tape to that area to keep it closed and adjust the Velcro on top since it is a bit large, maybe use the extra velcro and use it for the mid section :-) maybe makers will make these adjustments based on reviews here. I'm going to do it because I'm picky on these robes and have not been able to replace my old fading duck one I loved so much."
4.0,Order a size smaller than what you normally wear to have a better fit. I love the quality and the color was perfect.
4.0,Fit great!!! Providing the dimensions in the product description ensured this was the right choice. Appear to be well made. No labeling for UV protection which does make me wonder???
4.0,Delivered on time. Very comfortable. True to size. Not too short. Perfect color. Design is stylish! Great dress for the price. Would buy it again and I‚Äôd highly recommend it.
4.0,"Great value and they are super bright. I wish they would omit the white ones, the colors are much more popular."
4.0,Seems to work as advertised.
4.0,"I got my glasses yesterday. They are cute, but feel like they could break easily. They are light weight and fit nice and tight. The gold accents are adorable. They are a little bit bigger lens but are cute! They will work out perfect with the upcoming summer months! I would buy a second pair and recommend them to others!"
4.0,"The shoes are nice, but very easy to peel off if your child runs in them to go to bathroom or try to best his brother or sister to the front seat. Scratches very easily. Material is just to gentle."
4.0,Loved it I'll be ordering another because I'm going to wear this one out!
4.0,"I‚Äôve never had leggings with pockets and for a basic few pairs, they‚Äôre a great first. :)"
4.0,"The dress is adorable, it was just a little shorter than I was expecting. I am 5 ft 4 inches and it went above my knee. Once I added the under skirt it was a bit shorter than I wanted, but still cute."
4.0,It‚Äôs super comfortable and warm with a ton of stretch. It is a touch short so anyone with a long torso mind find it to be an awkward length but I‚Äôm short so I was able to tuck the front in just enough to give it some shape.
4.0,Very comfortable but is way too big!
4.0,"Looks great, but may be too gaudy for some circumstances."
4.0,Very nice and true to product description. I have been looking for something like this for a while.  Glad I got it
4.0,Was pleased with product and keep up those prices
4.0,I WILL PROBABLY ONLY WEAR ONCE.. IT FIT WELL THOUGH..
4.0,"Very nice quality. However, it was a gift for a 16 year-old and it was a bit big. Because of the Stainless Steel, it doesn‚Äôt bend to adjust the size."
4.0,"Wrinkles very easily, and some of the seams are not strong. This won't last me for more than 3-6 months with regular use, it's already falling apart. I love how cute the design is, and how lightweight the fabric is, is great for warm climates."
4.0,Product fit wonderfully.  Was very comfortable in weather of a hot summer day.  Not sure about print due to it not being made of same matrials as dress.  Apears it will wash off.  Heat made it change some in texture.  Not sure if it will hold up.  Print was like screen printing and not thick.
4.0,not as soft as the advertised ones on TV. my fault I suppose
4.0,"I loved this style when it came out in the 90's and I STILL love them. Comfy, versatile...they're everything! Well, I wish the ones I got were a half size larger. Next time, I'll know to upsize."
4.0,It is comfortable to wear and has good airflow with the vent in back. It does wrinkle easily when you dry it so you must remove it from the dryer immediately but if you do so it is fairly wrinkle free. It fit as expected and is a good value.
4.0,Part of a Flounder costume for a production of The Little Mermaid. It looks great over the yellow stretchy dress and leggings.
4.0,"Ok a little small, but the company refunded half my money in good faith"
4.0,"This dress is fun, cute, and super comfortable; for the price you can‚Äôt expect perfection, but it is HUGE! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 125 lbs, usually a size 4/S-M. I ordered a small and it‚Äôs really way too big. I‚Äôm keeping, but would have exchanged for XS and bought several more."
4.0,"Quality is super, though very big."
4.0,Good quality. Could have used 2 more inside pocket.
4.0,I got it for my nephew. It looks cute but it's similar to pajama material.
4.0,I love the fabric and quality
4.0,"Tie looks good. While it didn't good well with the shirt, I purchase it for, it does go great with some of my darker shirts."
4.0,Overall nice purchase and beads glow in the dark. It runs large though.
4.0,"The shoes fit perfect... it's the strap on right shoe that is tight like it's a half size too small. This is my second pair and I love them because the sole is soft, not stiff like most others! Wasnt worth sendin back."
4.0,Very nice. It would look nicer without the &#34;pipe cleaners&#34; put in the veil. We removed them and put little flowers in their place as they left holes in the netting once removed. They really should consider not adding them to the netting as it really takes away from the hat. We saw prior comments about them but we though it can't be that bad but it was.
4.0,Fit well. I am pretty skinny but this was not grossly big around the bottom.
4.0,"I was kind of wondering what the color would be when I ordered because it says red, but the picture looks more pinkish to me. They are actually a lighter, worn in looking red in person. I would've been happy with either. These boots are super cute! Perfect summer boot to wear with jean shorts and tees!"
4.0,The fit is good the color is a little different but that happens but the dress is great because its not a lining so it not super cheap like some other products out there.  I am please and will wear it for sure.
4.0,Overall good quality. Runs small.
4.0,Very feminine. I wear a cropped sweater over it as a cover-up.
4.0,"Shirt serves its purpose. Well made, comfortable fabric and it fits well. Snap closures are a bit tough to open and close but if you have help you will be fine."
4.0,"The color fades off, Aron skin sometimes"
4.0,This dress was true to the picture the girls really loved the dress. The only thing is the sizes run big. For the most part the dress turned out beautiful. Thank you
4.0,It's nice for the price!
4.0,A very fine belt! I assume the lining is leather too. Seems to be.
4.0,"Mostly as described just came alil tight so stretching is a must, otherwise good product"
4.0,"Pretty decent!! So yes, the pads near the breast need some adjusting here and there...however, it‚Äôs a small price to pay for the quality!!!"
4.0,"I really actually like this shirt. It arrived in a timely fashion, in great condition. The size chart is accurate, so I ordered according to my measurements, not my normal size category. The material is good, the snap closures are good, and I like the color!"
4.0,This magnetic band and cover turns my silver Apple watch into a gold watch.  This is nice for changing the look of the watch for different looks and coordinate with gold jewelry.  It is difficult to get on the watch because it is very flexible but it is worth the trouble.  The straps have to off to put the cover on which is different from the other covers/bands I have.
4.0,I ordered twice and received two different brands of gloves... but they were both pretty good and it was what it was described. White gloves lightly powdered.
4.0,Very comfortable easy to put on
4.0,Runs small.  My daughter likes them.
4.0,It seems to run a bit big. I really like the pattern on the suit and the coverage it provides is just what I was looking for.
4.0,I really love this head wrap and would buy other colors and wear very often.... it would get a 5‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ if it actually stayed in place. It needs a type of rubber grip to keep it in place.<br />The design can be worn in different ways which oddly enough allows this to be dressed up or dressed down. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reconfigure your design to add a grippy material underneath.
4.0,"Sizing is a bit off. Too small.<br />My little guy is 8 mo and average size (45th percentile). It's already a tight fit, so i can't see him wearing this for the rest of the winter. Maybe a month or two at best. I'm washing this by hand in cold water, and letting it air dry so that it doesn't shrink.<br />Other than that, i like this a lot. Best part is that it has the velcro flap so that he can't pull it off!"
4.0,Nice Jacket overall.  Outer Nylon material very substantial.  Just seems to run small.  Had to return and order a medium for my 15YO daughter.
4.0,Looks good on my husband. He's very tall and has a tight waste so its hard to find suits that fit well. the legs are still a little to short but fits his 32 waste perfect
4.0,Used it for a costume worked great and looks great
4.0,I bought this bag for school and its fits it purpose.  Its large and holds items I have. Its design is great and handles are sturdy. I love using this daily for all my needs. The price was great especially for this bag!
4.0,"The arms are just a tiny bit short on me, however I do have long arms, and its not enough to look weird so i dont mind. This is very cute, my only complaint is that if you wash and dry normally, it fuzzes up right away and sticks together very easily, so be careful and just air dry it."
4.0,"Daughter loved this. Just as she expected, as pictured."
4.0,There Ok.
4.0,"I ordered the large (5'7&#34; 160) in the light blue and it fit well - might have been able to get away with Medium.  The color is lovely - but I sent it back because of the fabric.  It was very wrinkled coming out of the package and I could tell by looking at it that I would need to iron it every time.  If that doesn't bother you, I would recommend this dress.  I just don't have time to iron."
4.0,It served its purpose as a costume. Material has a nice feel to it and is pretty soft. Fit is hard to judge because it's a loose flowy dress.
4.0,"Ordered four of the spaghetti-strap workout tank-tops and was weary about the quality but they turned out to be good!<br /><br />Here are [my] pros and cons on the item:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Fantastic material quality (like, wow).<br />- Spaghetti-straps are NOT thin and cheap (thick enough to not break or dig into shoulders and sewn into place very well and securely).<br />- Has a sports bra-like lining layer on the inside that holds the bra paddings into place (can remove padding with enough cloth coverage to hide your lovely tatas).<br />- Keeps tatas in place (medium hold).<br /><br />CONS<br />- SIZE UP if you don't want a snug fit (I'm a 34B bra size with a 36 inch bust and ordered size M but the tank tops were a bit snug, so I removed the padding to allow bust space. Size L would've been a better fit).<br />- Spaghetti-straps tend to roll inwards toward shoulder blades when exercising so be aware (recommend buying the wider tank strap version if you find rolling straps irritating).<br />- Cannot adjust straps if it ends up being too long for your chest/bust-to-waist length.<br />- Tank is shorter than you think (about an inch or two longer than the usual sports bra length).<br />- Bra paddings are a weird circular shape but removable."
4.0,"I use it every day. Light materials, but seems to hold up well."
4.0,Good colors. I like this üíØ
4.0,"A bit short, but otherwise just fine.  This was my 2nd purchase of this item."
4.0,Works great. A little goes a long way
4.0,I loved the multi-pack. Basic shirts. Size was great. Sleeves are just a little smaller than what my kid says is comfortable.
4.0,Look comfy feels comfy warm if you're inside but if you're outside and it's windy the wind goes right through because it's not a tight weave.
4.0,We have to send back as they are to small with the knee high school girl socks. I love these shoes the memory foam but they don't have the next size up in stock... kinda disappointed.  For that reason 4 stars.
4.0,They look and feel like the ones you can buy from AAFES (about $20 less). No issues so far.
4.0,My wife loves it.. Fits perfect as well.
4.0,Based on reviews I ordered a medium rather than my usual small and it fits well. I got a compliment when i wore it yesterday.  The material hangs nicely..
4.0,I like the leather it is made of. but it is very small. It was a gift for a friend.
4.0,I needed it get pass airport security as I am a frequent traveller...
4.0,"Just a little long, like the sleeves / ladies you understand . Haven't worn it yet but I will!! Slits on sides are ok maybe a couple of cross stitches will work / should have  a slimming effect"
4.0,"I used these for napkin rings for a dinner party...it was a bit tricky to arrange but everyone loved the place settings were done by photos rather than names and much cheaper than if I had tried to buy actual photo napkin rings or minuture picture frames. Worked great, the only reason I gave it four stars is because I didn't use them for keys and don't know their durability for that use."
4.0,"It was really cute on arrival, but unfortunately it didn't look good on me, as it clung on my upper arms,lol. It looks great on my daughter, and is well made and fashion-forward."
4.0,Wish it had a pocket
4.0,Fits great! ( I ordered a Large) I like the form fitting stretchy fabric. I bought to wear for my nieces wedding in August.
4.0,Much smaller than I expected.  But well made and don't irritate my sensitive ears.
4.0,"Absorbs sweat fine.  I have a relatively big head for a woman, so usually I have to buy men‚Äôs sports headwear.  I should have done that instead of buying this one.  If you have trouble with loose headbands that slip off, then this is the product for you.  Should fit smaller heads fine"
4.0,"Fit was good,well made,I like it."
4.0,"Very cute but wanted 3 sets, not just 2"
4.0,"Really cute shirt, my son loves to play with it while wearing! Runs a little small. Wash inside out to protect sequins"
4.0,I‚Äôm really happy with the warmth at first I thought that they were to small but after one wear they stretch out break in whatever and they are great
4.0,"Too big for my 6 month old, but will be cute when it fits her better when she‚Äôs older."
4.0,"It‚Äôs small enough to be used as a purse and use it to carry my IPad pro 11in, keyboard, a wallet, and pencil bag. Use it to carry my personal items while working"
4.0,Did not realize the style I received was the longer back but was going on vacation and rest of dress was perfect.
4.0,"This top works well with the hood up because it‚Äôs roomy & covers my whole head without slipping off.<br />But ‚Äî when the hood is down? It doesn‚Äôt lay nicely at all, no matter how much I fiddle with it!<br />It‚Äôs the same fabric as the rest of the shirt, so it‚Äôs not a weight problem. I finally had to just let it go & let it lay however it does & stop worrying about it.<br /><br />Besides that, the overall hoodie is a long sleeve shirt with a hood - there isn‚Äôt a band at the bottom like a classic hoodie.<br />The sleeves have thumb holes that are comfortable & the overall length is decent.<br />[SIZE REFERENCE]<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 140 lbs, 36B & typically wear either Med or Lg & 8/10. I ordered this in size Large because I prefer roomy to snug & the fit is fine.<br />ALSO: the bright green is really bright! As bright as the listing pictures show which is nice to know.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this & I hope it Helps with your shopping choices!**"
4.0,Blazer is smaller than I expected. Material is great and feels wonderful
4.0,It worked could of been a pinch bigger
4.0,"Looks very nice, it is a little big for my baby"
4.0,"It's a nice hat.  I have a small head (21"") and it fits little loose but not big.  I have tough time buying one size hat for that reason.  It's always way too big.  I like this one because 1) it fits and 2) it doesn't give me a hat-head after wearing it.  I give it a 4 stars though because the color on the site does not match the actual color.  On Amazon, it looks like army green but it's actually granny apple green (just like the name!)  It's brighter than I would like (it makes it look a bit childish...or you could say it's 'fun' color) but it's still nicely made and for the price ($10.99)...I'm going to keep it."
4.0,I like these. Will purchase again
4.0,"I bought these lenses, in spite of reading two very bad reviews, for three reasons: 1)It was becoming irritating, when shopping to have to switch between my reading and my distance glasses; 2)I admit that I am too cheap to pay for bifocals from an optical store, and I needed two different diopters, making buying generic bifocal readers not an option; and 3)these required no water. I was finding that the ones that required water to adhere distorted reading vision.<br />So far, I am finding that, while not perfect, these lenses suit my purposes well. As to the complaints of the two bad reviews: they claim that nothing they did resulted in the lenses staying in place. I did not have this problem. I cleaned my distance glasses, and the lenses, with a lens cleaner, dried them, and then placed them. They stick. I even had to move them around a couple of times, because I placed them incorrectly--still no problem getting them to stick.<br />Now that they are in the proper line of vision for me, my only issue is a small air bubble under each lens, but nothing that obscures reading vision.<br />They are not perfect, but overall, I give four stars."
4.0,I will recommend this product because it's exactly the same as what I expected.
4.0,Fit is great. The material reminds me of a Halloween costume a little (I might feel different once it‚Äôs ironed) but overall it‚Äôs really flattering.
4.0,looks good but very hard to close the bracelet.
4.0,The gloves are perfect for my bridesmaid ensemble. They have a satiny feel to them and fit well over my arms. The fingers are a tad bit long but I have fairly small hands. They are a much better price and quality then what I purchased at a local costume supply last year.
4.0,"Nice length, fabric is a bit thin. Super comfy."
4.0,I liked these.
4.0,They are perfect for me at 5‚Äô4‚Äù I can wear them high waisted and they hang nicely. I can wear my long johns under them for an extra layer and the material of these pants don‚Äôt show anything under them. They are just the lounge pants I was looking for!
4.0,"Look, it‚Äôs cheap. You get what you pay for. Having said that, I totally dig this jacket! I love wearing it and people love me in it."
4.0,"If u are on the top end of the size for socks, go up to the next size"
4.0,"Super cute and soft and comfy. The color is grey but the color behind the print has very light lavender hue in certain light, which I don‚Äôt have a problem with. I took off a star because the printed side is not centered. No one may notice but I do and it annoys me."
4.0,"I'm very satisfied with this license plate frame.  It is attractive and seems to be strong and durable. It took a little over a week to get here, so order early."
4.0,"For some reason my foot sometimes slips sideways, maybe that means they're too wide or something.  I really don't have much of an arch, so I can not give a recommendation on that.  I'm still very happy with these sandals as I plan to wear these in Cozumel this year to go to the pool with."
4.0,Fit great and was comfortable.
4.0,Great but I miss a lining.
4.0,"4 the price , u can't go wrong."
4.0,Works as described.  Still a little bulky for me to use while lifting weights.  More of a preference than an issue of the product
4.0,Easily scratched
4.0,As advertised. Bery bright and shiny!
4.0,This bag was the perfect size for my laptop and the various cables and spare devices like a detachable hddr. The only problem I have with it is the only headphones it really acomodates are ear buds and I dislike those things passionately. I would recommend this bag if you have a 14&#34;laptop.
4.0,"It fits well and the color is beautiful, however it is a sheer material that I do not believe was in description,  will have to wear this over a dress or shirt and pants"
4.0,Nice patriotic tie clip. Flag was mounted at an angle though.
4.0,I love this little purse and very roomy as well
4.0,Looks good to wear. Looks better in person
4.0,These cubes overall good quality. The bigger size is huge and take up so much space that I don't find them very useful. I would prefer having 4 medium size instead of 2 medium and 2 large.
4.0,Letters need to be more vivid
4.0,My daughter liked this.
4.0,"Good quality, fits my Oakley's just fine"
4.0,"They're fairly flimsy, but they look good for the low price! They dont fit my head, but they're comfortable around my neck and arrived fast."
4.0,I like this dress but it is very tight I would go with the one size up if you have big breasts. Cute dress you can dress up or down.
4.0,Not what expected but is ok
4.0,"Loved the material and weight, ordered my normal jacket size and knew it was oversized but it was huge, I‚Äôd recommended ordering a size down from normal"
4.0,Great quality and super cute outfit. Mine came back with a very bad smell so I had to return it.
4.0,I like it but I think this shorts are proper for tall men or boys.
4.0,"These are a slightly larger at the waist, not tighter like most sweatshirts.  But fun & cool!"
4.0,Love these! They remind me of that surfer boy look. It's not loose so I say get your regular size
4.0,"I thought the dark part of the leaves would be black, but it's actually a very dark teal - which is pretty, but FYI if you're trying to match something.  Dress is really pretty, soft tshirt material.  The double slits are great, edges are pointed, not rounded like the photo, which I liked better.  For once the length was good. HOWEVER - the dress is what I would call a slip dress - almost the same width from the bust through the hip.  Very stretchy fabric so fits over curves, but I don't like anything clingy over my stomach so I'm returning. May fit a different body better!  For reference, I'm 5'4"", 220lbs, 42DD, and carry my weight in my ample butt and lower tummy.  I got the XXL - White Floral"
4.0,Boot fit was a bit small for size 11 anyways I‚Äôm anticipating a cold winter and a warm boot to wrap it in my feet and hands are always cold hopefully not this winter
4.0,"Too small,,,, but apart from that the material is strong and worth the money spent,,,,, tho I gave it away.."
4.0,Had to shorten the straps as they are too long but otherwise it is fine.
4.0,Got these for the Sidi Dominators I got for Christmas. They seemed too long at first but after installation proved invaluable.<br /><br />They grip really well. Thought I would have problems clipping in but not once did I experience that problem.<br /><br />Wish they had Carbide tips that's why the four and not five star rating.<br /><br />Use Locktite on the threads so they won't work themselves out.<br />.
4.0,"The set is very adorable, however it seems like it runs somewhat small. My niece is almost 3 months‚Äîabout 10 lbs or more. it fits small on the stomach and loose on the arms.  I recommend hang drying this in order to get multiple wears."
4.0,I ordered this top and like it okay.  I'm only a little disappointed with the quality of the material.  I was expecting something a little thicker.  It's roomy by design and I do think the stated sizing correct.
4.0,"These arm warmers are very cool looking to wear with a costume, they are made of nylon so be ready for runs and snags! They catch easy on anything. Overall I think they are definitely worth the money."
4.0,"I looked at the all review. I was worried the size is not right for my 8months old son. However, when it arrived, it just fit on him. I bought largest one. Just price is a bit higher than other product but it looks cute."
4.0,I gave it to my so who mentors men
4.0,It was a little big but managed to work with it.
4.0,"I checked out the scarf when I received it before it was sent as a gift elsewhere.  It was a nice tan color so it's neutral and can go with anything.  It's also a great lightweight jersey knit so that it can be worn for most of the year.  The only thing I didn't love was that the edges are unfinished.  It keeps the scarf looking casual, but I wasn't expecting it (maybe I missed it in the description).  Other than that it's a great buy!  It's super soft!"
4.0,Worked great for what we needed it for. Not as real looking as I would have liked though.
4.0,"Quick delivery, product as expected"
4.0,Fits nice and doesn‚Äôt irritate me
4.0,Cheap and good looking.
4.0,I like it I'm a little disappointed the lines in the leaf aren't silver but oh well. Still love it!
4.0,You get what you pay for. I'm a little disappointed becaise I thought it would be longer. It is made of plastic and is very light weight.
4.0,This is a very good 'shaper'. Comfortable and light weight. Not binding. Doesn't make me look like a sausage. If it made me look 20 pounds trimmer I would say it is perfect !!!!!
4.0,It's hard to find socks that actually stay on and these did. They seem to have shrunk in the dryer...something to keep in mind. Great quality though.
4.0,"These look exactly like the picture! They even arrived a little early. I wish there were more colors. Really good price the quality is like what you'd get at Claire's at the mall it's just cutesy stuff it's not meant to look really expensive. The quality is good for the price. When I got them the earring posts were bent but that's an easy fix I was just afraid to break them. And the backings are just the small silicone ones so I use my own metal ones but over all they're comfy my ears<br />Don't get irritated , I don't wear them more than a day long and they're light weight"
4.0,"The Credit Card slots are tight, hopefully they will loosen up with use. Hard to get the cards out"
4.0,"Cute graphic. I have two of these. One in red/burgundy and one in green/turquoise. I like them both, fabric is good and stays intact after several washes. Color faded much more for the burgundy, but not so much that it‚Äôs an issue for me, although I prefer to use this more as a lounge shirt on a lazy day."
4.0,Perfect for the Halloween costume
4.0,I like the product except one piece has a minor scratch on the back. My wife has accepted it anyway.
4.0,"I ordered this suit as a post baby suit to hide my not so glamorous post baby belly. I really like it. Be sure to measure your exact inches to make sure this suit fits right. The only complaints I have about the suit is that sides of the suit are quite tight when putting it on and the legs or bottoms of the suit tend to ride up some. Also, it might seem like you are ordering a plus size suit when you take your measurements and find your size with the sizing chart but it's not a plus size suit. They just run small or have a weird sizing chart. Otherwise great suit. Love it."
4.0,I like the look of it and by the weight you can twll it's well made. The sizing tool works but it will bend if you bang on it to much when trying to pop out the pins. As long as you are carful it will work fine. There aren't any instruction on how to size it but a quick you tube search and you can figure it out quickly.
4.0,beautiful !!
4.0,"I wanted to give this a good review even though I returned it. I bought this to fit my IPad into- it did fit great and could still zip it. This was a very well made bag. It just wasn't my taste. It was too bulky/ boxy for me. I did return this because of that. However, if you don't dislike bulky bags, I would actually highly recommend this purse. This is a great purse for the price. For how well it was made, most people would buy this for 2x what it costs. Definitely try this brand. Again, like I said, it was just too bulky for me."
4.0,The headband went straight in the trash but the outfit is cute. It's a little big but workable.
4.0,I like the colors and graphics.
4.0,"This suede gum is much smaller than I expected, around the size of an old match box. Works well to remove dirt from wall panels make from suede."
4.0,Looks the same as the pic. Great!
4.0,"Ran small, but were a good value.  Donated them."
4.0,package  was broken
4.0,"I have not tested these in the cold yet, but upon receiving them I have to say these are really nice. They are very soft and super cute."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:1fded6e4af6861c7f7a88fd9a7066988]] The ring is amazingly beautiful! Stunning shiny amazing! The only downside is the size! It‚Äôs gigantic lol other than that, amazing"
4.0,"Super cute! They don't have a very relaxed fit. They sit at an angle againast my lobe rather than hanging down. I dont think anybody notices but me, but there tends to be a little line where the metal presses into my lobe after a long wear. Minor annoyance considering how adorable they are."
4.0,Great product. Reasonable price. Fast delivery.
4.0,I just got it so I can't give it a 5 yet. After reading reviews about size I decided to size up 1 size larger and I'm so glad I did.
4.0,"Ok, I like the color, I love the design inside, I love the smell of it, and I love how thin it is. What I don't like about it though is it's pretty wide, like overall, it might not fit in some people's pockets lol. It's also really hard around the outer edges, and it makes it feel unnaturally stiff. But, I will use it until it is no longer white, or falls apart 90% approve!"
4.0,Great dress very comfortable thought it would wrinkle fast but it didn‚Äôt.  Dress it up dress it down very much like this dress
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable and I like wearing it. The straps are thinner than I expected so I have to be careful about my bra straps but other than that, it‚Äôs perfect. I wore it to a summer wedding and the fabric was breathable. I‚Äôve also paired it with tights and a cardigan for a fall wedding. Highly recommend."
4.0,"This is a great casual/dressy shirt.  It is not as long as pictured in the photo.  It is a little tight in the thigh area.  I ordered the mint color earlier this year and love it!  It's perfect for jeans, leggings and skirts."
4.0,"Using over disposable blue masks to reduce edge leaks.  Got some elsewhere which were all solid colors, which I like best, but patterned ones will do."
4.0,Cute accessory for sure
4.0,Learning the controls is a bit touchy
4.0,I've order two packs of these. The first ones were great and held up over a year. The most recent ones split small holes in the seam in two of the pairs within a week of having them: one on the leg and the other in the crotch. It was disappointing but I still wear them around the house and they are comfortable and warmer than a lot of leggings. The are thick fabric so they do a little tummy shaping as well.
4.0,"I was disappointed that the actual material that the bracelet is on began to fray already but, I cut around the gray and it seems to be holding up well. Glad to have fir agate in my healing set of crystals."
4.0,Buena tela pero un poco m√°s grande de la talla esperada.
4.0,i' m happy with my order. I like how it's light and comfortable. the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I ordered a blue one and it was very light blue not like the one on the picture but still like it
4.0,Only down side is that it is hard to activate Siri
4.0,Cute product.
4.0,Very small.  Cannot fit two strands of paracord at the same time
4.0,So cute - a little tight on the head
4.0,color was darker than expected.  it said baby pink but it is not as pale as I wanted
4.0,"I bought them for my daughter who loves them , they are adorable, if your thinking about buying them you won‚Äôt be disappointed...."
4.0,"These are a great concept. I bought these to pluck my eye brows. I am right handed so the right side was pretty easy to do. The left side however.... the bottom part gets on the way, my hand needs to be right where the frame lays. I was able to push it down some and still able to see what I was doing. As far as make-up goes it works perfectly well!! Package arrived quickly and everything was intact."
4.0,"Very small hands but these don't leave the extra 2 inches at the end of fingertips. Soft, warm and as an added bonus they look great w/everything!"
4.0,"A great product, my only reservation is the design. Heel of slipper could be raised and strengthened so that is stays on foot more easily. Otherwise I'm happy with product. Warm as toast!"
4.0,Not easy to get on or off. Live the support and comfort
4.0,"These pants are super comfortable. I kept them because of that, but the overall fit is just okay. I've worn them twice already, and they're already a little stretched out. Overall, though, for thirteen bucks they're decent comfy pants."
4.0,"The embroidery on this blouse is beautiful. It‚Äôs very well done. It‚Äôs also centered properly, which is not always the case on affordable garments.<br /><br />The fabric is a gauzy material that is slightly itchy on my skin. It‚Äôs not terrible, but not great either. It‚Äôs a thin fabric, which is good for spring, summer, or fall, exactly as they have stated in their listing.<br /><br />The reason I have deducted a star in my rating is that there is a flaw in the fabric of my blouse, right in the front where it will be plainly seen. It looks like something ripped across it. I have included a photo.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful to you. If so please take a second and click the thumbs up button below!"
4.0,It's nicest more than what I got
4.0,"Although this is an Official HD shirt, it is not the quality of other comparably priced Official HD shirts I have purchased on Amazon.  Still a decent shirt, just a little disapointed."
4.0,"Refer to the image for sizing info and not the size guide link next to where you select your size to order.  They are very different.  I really like this t-shirt, but it is huge on me."
4.0,"These earrings are just missing the mark. The earring itself is pretty, nice weight and seems high quality. However the posts are so thin and flimsy that they bend just when I try to put the backing on. I am pretty scared that they will snap off, rendering the earrings useless. Would be great if this manufacturer could invest in a heavier, stainless steel post. I will update this review if they do break."
4.0,"Really cute dress!!! It was a little bit on the tighter side but it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable and I will use this dress all through October üòÅ at first I thought it was a little bit of a weird material, but it makes it so the dress isn‚Äôt unbelievably hot and it‚Äôs super comfortable. Totally recommend!! Beware of the chest though, luckily mine are on the smaller side but girls with a big chest may run into a problem. It fit just right for me though üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4.0,Like the shorts and the fit. Started fraying after the second wash.
4.0,"The straps were too long and too far apart for my frame, they were past my shoulders and about 2 inches too long.<br /><br />That said, I have long legs and a short torso. So the length of the straps being off for me is something I‚Äôve experienced before. The width being off was a new experience."
4.0,"I haven't actually ran with it yet, but I'm looking forward to it. It's light weight. I took a chance and ordered the s/m size and it's wayyyy too small. Everyone in the reviews bought a small so I figured it was safe however no matter your weight a large chest will not work with a size s/m. Wish I could exchange it."
4.0,The ad said something about dual compression. The second pannel is basically like tee shirt material. Product is definately good quality. Just not the compression I was looking for.
4.0,Love the watch.The is stiff but nice watch
4.0,"Super shiny and pretty, hasn‚Äôt turned my finger green yet, it catches on clothes and things sometimes but overall beautiful and met expectations"
4.0,This is a really pretty dress! I ended up returning it because it was a little warm for the occasion (wedding in the summer) but I love the cut and colors.
4.0,Too lose! I have to find a way to adjust it but otherwise great quality and very pretty
4.0,"They are a little clumsy to put on and take off, and not handy to store, but are surprisingly comfortable once they are on. I do wish the lenses came down a little lower, but I have VERY LARGE eyeglasses. The flip up feature is great."
4.0,Good quality love the color!
4.0,"Long and soft racer back, doesn't ride up and doesn't get all sweaty and gross. I got mine a little big so it rides really low on my chest but I work out in my garage so it's not a big deal. I have a rather large chest and the XL is pretty big on me."
4.0,Nice front. Little snug for my DD's.
4.0,Fun patterns. Standard chapsticks fit. Great for stockings! All-in-all we're pretty happy.
4.0,smaller than expected....
4.0,This is a repeat purchase for me. Not the most durable suit‚Äîit lasted about a year of relatively hard use‚Äîbut it‚Äôs less expensive than the big name brands.  Good value.
4.0,very cute and looks exactly like picture.
4.0,"I hate the chain, but that's not a problem because I have many silver chains, but the pendant itself is very pretty."
4.0,Loved the suede.
4.0,Great way of having the many ponytail holders I wear on my wrist look a little classier than normal.
4.0,"My daughter loved the coat. However, it didn't fit too small. She is 5 6' and 125 lbs. We got a medium We returned it the same day and reordered a bigger size. Hoping this time it fits because she really liked the coat."
4.0,This was purchased for a gift. Runs a bit small. Nice design though
4.0,I am happy with this purchase and would strongly recommend.
4.0,"My average size glasses fit great. My large framed ones barely fit. Otherwise, I'm happy with it. It's this is very nice looking."
4.0,"These leggings are great, I have no complaints. They are soft and comfy! I don't particularly care for the shiny/silky leggings, so these were perfect. They were soft, not see through, and they didn't show/leave sweat marks. Love them, I will definitely buy more!"
4.0,"I ordered this through my husband's Prime account, hence no ""Verified Purchase"", but trust me, I did. And I'm really frustrated and disappointed because this dress is almost perfect.<br /><br />It's comfortable, it's good material and is thick and sturdy enough to not look cheap or flimsy, it seems well-sown and it fits almost perfectly all over my body. I'm 5'8"", between 125-130 lbs and roughly 33""-25""-35.5"", and the dress is very flattering except in the hips - its Achilles' heel.<br /><br />For some reason the left hip is cut pretty wide so it has an annoying, unattractive pucker (which sticks out a good inch so it looks pretty ridiculous) because my normal-sized hips/thighs don't fill it out all the way. I could understand the L maybe, but a S does not need to have such big hip seams. Very few women who will need (and look good in) a Small are going to have huge, round, extra-wide hips to fill this out. If I had big saddle bags it might work but fortunately I do not. It's definitely inconsistent with how the rest of the dress is cut.<br /><br />I haven't decided yet if it would be worth finding a seamstress to take that side in a bit or if I should just return it. But I definitely can't and won't wear it as it is. I really hope they fix the design and cut the S better because this is almost a perfect dress. People complain about ""thin privilege"" nonsense and act like all clothes are always geared towards skinny women only but I often find almost the opposite to be true, especially with certain articles like dresses and most pants, even when I get the smaller sizes! So many are so inconsistent and seemingly made for weird figures with either big waists and tiny legs, or tiny waists and huge hips and thighs, like this dress. Sigh...the hunt for a good, simple but flattering, comfy, affordable cotton dress continues..."
4.0,"Very comfortable, soft fabric, I like it!"
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34;',  it could be a bit longer by about an inch. It's VERY see through so I can't actually wear it without shorts over it which defeats using it for yoga. Good for a regular workout or run.."
4.0,Dress is comfy and fits true to size- if a little roomy. I received lots of compliments.
4.0,I really like dress. it's really pretty and comfortable. Perfect for this season.  Only thing is waist is little bit higher than i expect. Other than that i love this dress.
4.0,I had the wristlet and it was too big for my pocketbook. This one is just right. Pretty colors.
4.0,Love the product but don‚Äôt like the inserts. Wish they were sewn in!
4.0,Great hat for summer !
4.0,Earrings were pretty color just what I was looking for. A little heavy but beautiful sparkle. A Giving 4 star because a stone came out and I glued it back in.
4.0,I thought they were larger.
4.0,Very pretty little pin.  Nice accent
4.0,"very pretty necklace but not as pic, only smaller circles no large circles.  I want larger circles silver necklace.  sent back.  still looking"
4.0,"it was ok, looked like a completely different shirt on the computer. wasnt very happy with the size either. eh!!"
4.0,"Nice, fit true to size. Really soft boot cut yoga pant.  The material was a bit thinner than what I was expecting but I'm just saving them for warmer weather. I'm considering another pair for those upcoming days when you need something not so heavy."
4.0,It was a little small for 12 months to 2t was hoping it would fit like a 18 month And it fit more like a 12 month
4.0,like it okay for pink
4.0,The belt looks good and is made well. I had ordered the large and it was much too big. Ordered the medium and it‚Äôs almost too small.
4.0,Nice to see costume
4.0,I like the necklace but thought it was rose gold over stainless steel.
4.0,This runs small to size. You definitely need to order a size up
4.0,"I returned them even though the quality was excellent,  it was too heavy for a keychain, my pocket was dragging and pulled down, I bought a lighter one<br />instead."
4.0,"A little tight but the wife likes them, so it's all good."
4.0,Lume could be a bit better but a cool clean watch the price.
4.0,Like the product but too small. I would like to exchange if possible for a size 4x.<br />twilbur1934@gmail.com<br />910-592-3779
4.0,Really cute but kind of short
4.0,"The size was tighter than stated, but it does fit. Bike pants, from my experience, usually break in. Otherwise very nice in quality."
4.0,I'm totally sexy üòò üòú Thanks üòä
4.0,It was better than I expected. At first I wasnt sure about it but I actually would like one for myself. Really pretty.
4.0,The hat was perfect for my trip.  It crumpled up to fit in my bag or suitcase and popped right back into shape when i needed it.  My only issue was that it was kind of tight...but I have a lot of hair so I usually have that problem.
4.0,"Nice swimsuit top. Looks like the picture. I ordered a xxl and usually wear a1x and this fits perfectly. The suit is a little see through on the bottom, but otherwise good quality and fit."
4.0,Can be better
4.0,"I absolutely love everything about this watch, except the movement. The Miyota 8215 is accurate enough and hand winds but the lack of hacking just annoys me. I just feel like the times simply never correct (because it isn‚Äôt). I knew what I was getting when I ordered, and the only reason I can get past it is everything else. The fit and finish are amazing in this price range. The watch is simply beautiful and that fact keeps me drawn to it. Bracelet fits me well enough, but the bezel insert is the true star and it just makes you want to constantly look at it. 4 stars overall because of the movement but 5 stars for the fit and feel. Did I mention I love this watch."
4.0,"When ordering I thought it was a girl size not a woman,I really love the dress,if I order a size small in woman could my granddaughter wear it she's a size 12"
4.0,I order too big but the ring can bend to fit tighter.
4.0,"The dress itself is super cute! I ordered it for my bridal shower. It is a little short on the backside, I had to refrain from doing any bending over. It wasn‚Äôt terribly sheer, but from reviews I had read I used white undergarments like boy shorts just in case. It was not the most flattering dress for my body type. From an angle it looked like I was kinda pregnant, it just hanged off that way. It‚Äôd be a cute baby shower dress for sure. I went with an XL, I may have been able to go with a L, but not sure how that size would have affected the fitting of the sleeves and chest area."
4.0,I ordered a large and it feels like a small...
4.0,It's difficult to see the very tiny stars. Quantity of sand is a very small jar.
4.0,"Bought these to use when going on the boat and jet ski.  These keep my hair from getting wind tangles!!!! I wish they were a little tighter but could be I just have a little head.  They do work like I wanted them to, I just have to be careful that they don't roll up and blow off in the wind. Certainly cannot complain for the price!!!!"
4.0,"Like the boxers but gave them to my Son, were to small for me. Will reorder a size larger for myself."
4.0,Nice quality. Runs a bit small.
4.0,Love the color..
4.0,I‚Äôm missing the belt that goes with the dress
4.0,"The first time I ordered this product was the Gray joggers, and it was great fit so comfortably, also the order was here by the next week. I'm giving it 4 stars cause when I ordered the same product of the black joggers, it totally did the opposite, I had to wait like a month to get it , and when I washed the black joggers it shrunk, but somewhat still fit though. So I figured when I got my gray joggers it was from LA, but when I ordered the black ones it came from China. Other than that highly recommend these joggers. GET THEM!! If it comes from China, your somewhat screwed haha"
4.0,"Perfect for summer layering, it's oversized so it fit great and came fairly fast"
4.0,This is a great little outfit. The tunic top is very interesting....I haven't seen anything like this anywhere else.  The dramatic side slits make this very striking.  the fit is a little large.  I usually wear a medium and this medium was pretty loose on me.  I won't be able to wear the shorts...they are very large on me and the fabric is too thin for pants but i can wear the tunic with other bottoms.  I got the ombre black and its very nice.
4.0,Love this dress! Got this as a gift from a friend for a cruise! Gorgeous! Got a white crop tank to wear under and it worked perfect!
4.0,"This bag is perfect for me. Now that I'm older, I don't want to drag a handbag around. This bag is perfect for keeping my phone, driver's license, and a few cards and cash. It's lightweight and I appreciate that I can wear it hands-free while I'm walking. The one negative is that the little loops that attach the straps to the main bag wore out on my first one. They wore out and tore off after less than two years of use. I did reorder because I like the bag, but if money is tight for you, it's something to be aware of."
4.0,"Ordered these for 4 and 7 year olds, as they were labeled &#34;Kids&#34;. Well, that's a bit misleading; it barely stays up on the 7 year old, and falls right down on the 4 year old.<br /><br />But you know what? My kids love them! The 4 year old doesn't like scarfs but loves this as a &#34;neck gaiter&#34; which means we no longer fight that battle. Older one wears it both ways, but complains when it won't stay on her nose (or rides up into her eyes).<br /><br />Originally thought I was going to have to return them when they wouldn't stay up, but kids want to keep them."
4.0,loved it!! my daughter looked so adorable in it. it looks just like the photo! the only thing I would recommend would be to super glue the safety pin on the bow. it's only held on by two clasps and the bow kept falling off but the safety pin part would still be on the dress. a little super glue and it would be perfect!!
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the structure and detailing of the dress. Zipper back, roomy bodice, pockets, and the front split/wrap give it lots of detailing. My only complaint is that the built in slip is very thin and very short. I had to be strategic in sitting in a chair because the front split is pretty high and the slip stops mid thigh. If you're going to be standing or sitting behind a desk, you won't notice it."
4.0,"It works for what it is. Looks cute so long as you match it well- the leaf is super shiny light gold that could look tacky depending on what you wear, but the belt fits perfectly (natural waist is 27&#34;). Snug enough to actually hold my high waisted skirts at the natural waist, but does not squeeze my fat into a bulging state. I am very pleased with this purchase for what I paid."
4.0,I love it just wish I would have gotten a bigger size üò©
4.0,"These are really pretty earrings. They are large and bold, and I love the abstract design. Most everything on the earring is plastic, so they are very light, too. Be aware that some of the &#34;metal&#34; parts are actually plastic."
4.0,It looks exactly like the picture! Actually very warm (warmer than I expected) with good material. Very comfortable. I bought this for myself so as a female the fitting is kind of uncomfortable around the chest area but that is not anyone‚Äôs issue as it is marketed as a male‚Äôs clothing item! So really nothing I can complain about! Would be a great item for the right person
4.0,"in fact, i bought this product two years ago and it still looks good.  people do comment about how good  and rich it looks."
4.0,"I've been pleased with this dress.  It's extremely comfortable.  I'm 5'4&#34;, and it hangs to about my mid-calf, a good length for me.  I also really like the nice rounded neckline, not too high but also not too low.  The only thing I'd say is that the fabric is somewhat thin.  This doesn't bother me--I actually kind of like thin, lightweight fabrics for comfort.  Also, I usually wear tights and something over the dress such as a jacket or sweater.  Just be aware. That's the only reason I'm giving this item four stars instead of five."
4.0,The color and cut is just right
4.0,"This keyring is very nicely made! It's solid, extremely functional and so far, I love it. The presentation box was beautiful and well designed. I had a detachable keyring made by Coach that constantly came apart and I was always worried that I would lose half my keys! The design of this keyring would make an accidental separation almost impossible. I have 4 stars because the leather loop could and should be larger. I have small hands and feel it's too small."
4.0,They arrived on time and are very pretty.Didn't expect them to be as big as they are but they worked for what I wanted them to work with.Nice quality.
4.0,This dress is super cute! I‚Äôm a 4-6 5‚Äô4 and ordered the medium instead of my suggested size of a small. It was sooo short. I ended up returning and have repurchase the large for length
4.0,"I ordered a size large when I would normally order a size medium. It fits me perfectly and it's not too loose or tight. I feel as though the fabric is a bit thin, but for the price, it's not bad at all. I have worn it a few times and it hold up nicely in the wash. It is simple and cute with many types of outfits. While the fabric might not be of the highest quality, I got what I ordered, and it came super quick. Really no complaints here!"
4.0,Lense is pretty good. Does not hold nose piece in well
4.0,I like the fabric and the print!
4.0,I hate bras. This is the most comfortable &#34;bra&#34; I've found. It is not not not for anyone who wants or needs any support. It's just the thing for a bit of coverage. I ordered a second. I'm hand washing them but they will likely wear out quicker than a regular bra because of the material. But inexpensive enough to get new!
4.0,Super cute and soft but way too long for my 5‚Äô3‚Äù self. Wouldn‚Äôt make sense to pay to hem so had to return.
4.0,"One side is slightly lower/longer than the other, but it isn't very noticeable. It slips off the shoulder when you lean forward. Sturdy, nice quality and a unique fun accessory. I like it."
4.0,"The JMEEIR Lightweight Drawstring Linen Shorts are comfortable, lightweight, well fitting pair of shorts that are very reasonably priced for their quality and fit.<br /><br />THE GOOD:  The elastic waist with drawstring allows for maximum adjustability for a super comfortable fit.<br />  The material is very soft and comfortable.<br />  The pockets, one on each side and one on the back, are roomy and seem well sewn.<br />  The look is casual - perfect for a summer day spent strolling around or going to the pool or beach.<br />  The price is very reasonable<br /><br />The Bad:  As shown in the above picture the care instructions require either a lot of effort to clean at home without shrinkage or sending out to the dry cleaners.<br />  There are these weird areas of red stitching at each pocket and at the side and bottom of the fly.  I assume that this is a design ""feature"" but it just looks weird to me.<br />  The shorts are not actually linen but a blend - as shown in the above pictures it is a blend of 70% cotton and 30% linen.<br />  Like most ""linen"" pants and shorts the material can at times appear translucent - something I learned years ago to my dismay given what I was wearing.  This is something that should be kept in mind when deciding what to wear under these shorts.<br /><br />All in all, however, these shorts are definitely worth your consideration if you are looking for a reasonably priced, casual but good looking, pair of shorts for wearing while enjoying a summer's day."
4.0,I like the sweatshirt overall. It did fade quite a bit with one wash.
4.0,"Seemed like a good shoe, but I never got to wear it. Depending on the shoe, I usually wear between an 8.5 or 9. The suggested size for me was 8.5, but I ordered a 9. It was way too small.  I didn't have time to re-order, but if I had, I would probably have ordered at least a 9.5, or maybe even a 10. My toes were right up to the tip and scrunched."
4.0,"I really love these scarves.  They are a little thin, making it easier for them to snag or tear.  But that delicate characteristic about them is part of the appeal for me, since clearly these scarves are not really intended for warmth, but more so a fashion accessory.  I've gotten so many compliments on the ones that I have and love the various colors that are offered."
4.0,great for handling tools.  I accidently got brake cleaning fluid on them and they disintegrated.  I'm on my second pair and would buy them again.
4.0,little tight up top but still a great dress
4.0,Great seller and good product
4.0,the quality of the shift is different from that of the skirt
4.0,"As the title says, well made, but I can't consider these low rise, they are too high to put under skinny jeans."
4.0,Love it just wish it was a little looser
4.0,Love it!  Fit as expected.
4.0,"Top notch fabric, it has no stretch so isn't optimal for a one size fits most option. I am 5'7&#34; 140# US size 12/14 and prefer loose fitting clothing. The dress goes mid calf and is somewhat short/tight under the armpit. I'm keeping it because I really like it, though it's on the snug side for me, it's doable. If they all come out cut the same, it's a 10/12."
4.0,"Love the pattern and thickness of the dress, but I have c cups on a 6'1 frame (they look fairly small) and they are trying to fill in two enormous boob pockets. I wish it were more form fitting through the torso, it kinda just bows out creating unnatural curves. I guess this would be perfect for someone either very tiny that needs the curves or a curvaceous plus sized woman that can fill it out. If you are fit with a pear shape like me it may not be the best look. I wont be returning because it'll be a work dress and will just go under an apron that will be sinching in on the right places.<br />I'll probably order 2 sizes smaller next time."
4.0,"I am 5' 7&#34; tall 35&#34; inch waist. I ordered the XXXXL Mordenmiss Women's Hoodie. Biggest size there was. It was okay in width but not long enough like the girl in the picture, so it will be cute for all the thin waist shorties. It's a thin sweater so it's good for the cool not freezing days above 60¬∞F. Just wish it wasn't so short. Also the hood is way too small for my likeness. I have a flat head and don't wanna show it off lol Oh and something I almost forgot to mention is the pockets on sides. I like them, I can barely shove my galaxy mega in them."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but I am just incredibly fat.
4.0,"Awesome hoodie. The print doesn't have any flaws, even after a few washes. On arrival it was a little smaller than I'd like in the chest area, fine everywhere else. The fit didn't change after washing it, so that's awesome."
4.0,"Great bargain.  It's a bit small in width so won't go thigh high, just above the knee, but I really like them.  Soft outside material and color is even."
4.0,"It's comfy and fits accurately. I got a small, but usually im a medium."
4.0,"I loved everything about the jacket, except for two things:  it runs a little small, so buy the next size up, and the waist buckles on the back of the jacket are not adjustable."
4.0,Nice overall but the mechanism to latch the bracelet is a bit cheap.
4.0,I like It just the material is a bit itchy and if you‚Äôre tall don‚Äôt order a medium it‚Äôs short on sleeves.  However it‚Äôs really cute
4.0,"This is pretty stiff when you first get it, It's unbuckled and flat in the package, you need to buckle it and I just put it between my hands and rolled it back And forth to Make the leather not as stiff and uncomfortable. It's still a little  stiff but my son likes it and so far no complaints. Stitching is good buckle is good holding it shape well ,  hopefully it will soften up a bit.<br /> I received this at  lower price to review"
4.0,"It was far too thin for pandemic protection so I submitted a return. Got a refund with no issues.<br />Honestly, good product for the look but not as an alternate to a mask for going to the store right now in the covid times."
4.0,Love the color and it really comfy. First Wash should be on its own. Just wash in cold water and hang
4.0,These earrings are super cute. How ever I wasn't expecting them to be so small.
4.0,"Decent pair for the costs but works great for an extra pair at the pool.If the case wasn't included, it wouldn't have been worth it."
4.0,A beautiful product for a very reasonable cost along with excellent service.  Highly recommended.
4.0,It was already missing a few diamonds from the horseshoe when it arrived and the red scratched almost immediately after purchase. I use it on my keys ‚Äî hope it doesn‚Äôt fall off my keychain soon. I am not sure if it really brings us luck or protects us but here‚Äôs to hoping it‚Äôs legit‚Äô
4.0,"looks beautiful on the body, but it doesn't say that it's a corset style, so you need someone to help you tighten it on your body"
4.0,I like this dress a lot. I have the light pink color and it's a little see through. That's a slight down side. Im also a c-cup and the dress's bust area isn't big enough and hits at a weird spot on my chest. I still really like the dress despite these draw backs. The fabric is super soft.
4.0,patch is smaller than expected
4.0,Purchased for a boat party. Love the stretch of the material. Hit every curve. My husband loved it
4.0,"I ordered up a size and it fits nicely. It's not the highest quality, but at this price, I wasn't expecting that. Warm and comfortable casual shirt for cold climate living."
4.0,If your an average size guy and wondering if this will fit you (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 150 lbs) It should. For me it fits well on my second to biggest toe. It works fine with socks on and I forget it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs always nice to have my toes protected by pentagrams. üòÇ
4.0,Buen dise√±o.
4.0,The material was a bit different than the photos show but still looks nice. The shirt is meant to be loose so I'd recommend ordering a size smaller than what you'd typically wear so it's not too blousy.
4.0,"I love these earrings.  I will probably order another pair, just because I love them so much."
4.0,"Way too small for me 5'4&#34; 155 ... so I gave it to friend who is 5'3&#34; 110, she loves it"
4.0,"Like many had said, you need to order 1 or 2 sizes larger than normally warn.  Wife is 38C ordered 42C and that fits."
4.0,Updating my review from a 2 star.<br /><br />Used to have issues with the belt constantly loosening up on me so it wasn‚Äôt holding my pants up at all.<br /><br />Flipped the belt around and now I‚Äôve had much better luck. Solid belt for what it is.
4.0,"I am disappointed to find that this came with no trace of care instructions. Is it machine washable? What about the dryer? Should I take it to a dry cleaner? I have no idea. There‚Äôs no tag stating the care instructions, nor is it written anywhere above.<br /><br />That said, this jersey is GORGEOUS. I am absolutely in love, and would purchase another if I only knew how to clean it...."
4.0,the dress was to small I wear a medium in my clothing and this medium fit like a small.<br />I did order per the size chart and it was not accurate.
4.0,It's too small size large is like a medium maybe extra large or extra extra large world look like a large
4.0,Great quality but runs small - returned & exchanged
4.0,"They are quite nice, just wish the clips were a little stronger, as I was using them to pull loose clothes a bit tighter across the waisted back."
4.0,The dress material isn't all that great. And a little different from how the photo is. Not bad and not the best
4.0,A very good Watch. Worth the money. Slightly larger bezel than the more common watches. This is a good thing.
4.0,I felt this shirt was slim cut through the body. I ordered a large and I‚Äôm typically a woman's US medium/ large. It fit snuggly but perfect with a shaping tank underneath. The length was perfect to cover the tummy and the side panels gave a very slimming illusion.
4.0,SERVES ITS PURPOSE.
4.0,I really liked this bracelet but from the picture on Amazon it appeared to be much bigger. The turtles are very small it's a very dainty bracelet.
4.0,"Nice fit, soft, & good size band."
4.0,"This is gray (grey). Product image shows black. Material is soft and smooth, very comfortable and stretchy. Fit is good. I wear a size L T-shirt and this size L fits as expected. Sleeve length is good too. The only part that was not so great was the neck. In the product photos it looks like a crew neck but when I have it on, it slightly creeps up into a turtle neck."
4.0,I took heed to the advice to go one size larger for US . Fits well comfortable padding is thick and comfortable shipping was fast and price was great
4.0,"I have had this for about three weeks now, and I have to say I am satisfied. I have always been a boiling hot person, even as a child. Anytime the temperature gets above 70, I am miserable. That delightful change of life made matters even worse. I have been looking at vests for a while, but most are designed for men, not a boob-a-licious female. This one seemed like it would work, so I took the plunge.<br /><br />PROS:<br />It fits fairly well, and keeps me cool. I can wear it for hours at a time, and I don't really feel it. I told you I was boiling hot. It cools me down nicely after working out.<br /><br />CONS:<br />It is heavy. I am a five foot nothing female, so perhaps a big athletic dude would not feel it. It is also not the most comfortable thing to sit in as it is kind of lumpy...obviously it is a giant wearable ice-pack, so that really cannot be helped. The straps do not stay tight, I am constantly cinching them in. I think a few well-placed stitches will fix this.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it. If I lose a few pounds as a result of wearing it, I will be over the moon, but I actually bought it for cooling."
4.0,Arrived as stated. Beautiful dress. Seems well made. Just not floor length. I had to order the 8/9 for all her measurements. But her hight is 52 in. We do need to have it steamed. You do not have to have a petticoat but we are using one to give it a fuller look. My daughter loves this dress for her pageant. She screamed When she opened it.
4.0,I love the three quarter sleeves!  The tunic covers my rear end and I'm comfortable wearing this with leggins even to church!
4.0,"This hat is a solid deal for the price. Yeah shipping adds a lot to the price, but that's why its only like $2. The hat itself is kind of stiff, but that allows you to mold it into the form you want; add the 'slouch' and folds wherever you want and they hold up fairly well. Overall a decent hat for the price, I would recommend it if you want a cheap hat - just know that's what it is and you'll be fine."
4.0,"They're beautiful!  I also found out the hard way they are handcrafted and very delicate. So to make them last treat with fragility. They break easily. Co. Gives you refund quickly. They are very long, which I don't mind I'm very tall. You have to put the ear ring and loops together and they come apart a lot.  This is where fragility comes in. The little hole broke off on mine. So easy does it. They are very very beautiful."
4.0,Order a size up I returned mine it was to small
4.0,Removed the red nose guard and they fit better.
4.0,I love this shirt and decided to order another one in a different color. I am a little concerned how it will wear and wash. But I have only worn it once and have not washed it yet.
4.0,"Buena confecci√≥n,  pero la tela algo tiesa"
4.0,"Nice, black one is bigger than the white one though, I assume bc it's for the dude but uh overall it's nice, the elastic does seem to stretch over time but for the price you can't beat it."
4.0,"Good, but the lenses are not quite as blue as they appear in the picture"
4.0,"The fit was as expected, however the material is somewhat thing"
4.0,"This dress fits very well. I got the medium and it fit perfectly. There is some nice rouching on the side, which adds a nice detail. The fabric feels very soft, it is not very thick though. There is an odd smell when straight out of the package, I am currently washing it, hope this goes away."
4.0,Great product for the price.  Actually more comfortable than I would have expected.
4.0,Had to cut the belt to fit. Which I guess is to be expected for a one size fits all. Very stylish and comfortable.
4.0,"Super comfy and absorbent after a shower. Had been looking for a replacement for the same sweatshirt material for quite a while. It does run large, get a size down. I don't mind it, not worth returning since I'm otherwise happy with it."
4.0,"My daughter had fractured her nose which required surgery to fix.  I ordered this so she could finish out a local soccer club game season.  The guard was easy to adjust, and did the intended job.  Her only complaint was looking down at times was difficult to see the ball."
4.0,I like that the dress was stretchy enough for me to not have to unzip it to put it on. It does show every lump or bump so i recommend a shapewear smoother. Also if you are shapely this  dress will definitely make you look amazing ..
4.0,"As of the date of this review I measured my waist at approximately 32"". Based upon the size guide I order a large (tag size) which is recommended for  29.5"" to 30.5"" waist. The waist fit fine but I found myself floating in the built-in mesh briefs which were quite big. Further embarrassment resulted from the size of legs which gave my legs the appearance of pencils in a coffee mug. At 5'6"" and 136"" lbs I could not fill these out for a good fit therefore I returned. I gave one star deduction for the fitted waist but parachute (over sized) fit of the built in briefs. I returned the shorts but considering we all have different body types that comes with trying different clothing to find what best fits your preference. Unfortunately, these did not satisfy for my preferences due to the aforementioned awkward fit.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />I was impressed with the materials and the material was stitched together well as far as I noticed. Great color combo. I am fan of adding hints of high visibility colors so the green highlights are perfect. The material is light and highly breathable allowing air to transition to my skin."
4.0,This is a very nice necklace but it is very heavy.<br />I had to take it off after an hour because my neck was sore.<br /><br />I ended up getting a necklace ‚Äòweight‚Äô to clip to the back of the necklace to help with the distribution of the weight.
4.0,"For the price, I definitely expected the material to feel cheaper, but it's actually quite comfortable. My only issue is that the bra padding is stiff and becomes crumbly easy."
4.0,Not as long as a tunic should be.
4.0,"The skirt definitely is a see through material type but for the price it's not bad. Good for summer when there's trips to the pool, beach or just longing around. 4 stars just because of the material."
4.0,look it..
4.0,Good for the price I guess I can't complain. Had about ten that didn't work and one was in when the package arrived .
4.0,Work well and can be left in for long periods without noticing them. The clips are a little flimsy however - would buy again regardless.
4.0,Received them like the wrapping like the case I hope they stand to their name if so I will be buying more
4.0,Great flag for the money! Colors are bright & vivid. Flag is lightweight & easy to handle! It flows well with just a light breeze.
4.0,"Adjustable and soft, easy to install...only thing is that the white daisies get dirty fast.. otherwise a good buy."
4.0,Wow I love my boots!!! Quick delivery and boots fits GREAT!! I am 5‚Äô6 I wear a size 10. It‚Äôs true to its size!! The Material is wonderful!! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them out with friends!!!
4.0,"it looked slightly different and not as nice in person, but my sister loved it."
4.0,"Comfortable compression socks to wear around the house.  Fun styling too.  Have not owned long, so only washed a couple times so far."
4.0,"Wish I had known they run small, now I need to be super careful with it in the wash..."
4.0,I like the colors but why stars?  Material is nice and does not wrinkle.  Says it's a dress.  But I feel it's more like a oversized bed shirt.  Not sure if I want to wear to work.
4.0,"Labeled 3 pack, but only 2 included. Otherwise, great fit and not restrictive."
4.0,"very cute shoe, should have taken heed to the other reviewers and ordered a size smaller, the shoes too big for her to wear now. In the meantime I'll visit the fabric store to see what kind of shield I can use as a protectant."
4.0,Warmer sock but tighter fitting than you would think. Thinking about taking 1 of the pair and cutting them to ankle sock height.
4.0,"I ordered a size 7.5 and the length of the shoe fit but the space where the toes go in DID not go in even a little. I would say my feet are average size, more narrow and still did not fit."
4.0,blue lens is the best
4.0,The kids loved it.  They are excited about it.  It works well.  Maybe it could've been a bit louder but overall it was a good buy.
4.0,Jean fit perfect not problem ...only the waist was a little large and need to wear a belt.
4.0,Yeah breath
4.0,"Very pretty, my wife loved it."
4.0,I am about 150lbs and have a pretty large chest. I ordered a medium and it fit pretty damn good! Cute shirt
4.0,I first ordered an xlg. I'm usually a large in shirts but read some reviews and suggested to size up. Way to big for me. Very comfortable and wearable but I wanted more of a smaller fit. Ordered a large and it's perfect. Only dislike I have is the sleeves are a bit too short.<br />Would definitely order another color.
4.0,"Great product, was a little big for my ear but nothing a little bending didn't fix."
4.0,Nice belt buckle enamel isnt perfect but worth the money .
4.0,I really like it. It does shed a bit at first though.
4.0,"My hips are wide and the sleeves didn't work well proportionally. Otherwise, a pretty dress."
4.0,"This is a very nice scarf. Very lightweight but enough to even take a bit of chill off neck or shoulders. It can be used in many different ways. I love the polka dot design, which is on both sides of the fabric. It's polyester, which means it's durable but perhaps not as cool in the hot hot weather as cotton. Polyester is also cheaper than cotton which is why I marked it down one star. Not sure it's worth $15 unless you absolutely love polka dots! But I know I will get a lot of use out of it as I do."
4.0,"I had to return it but basically for the same issue I have with all 2 pieces that you have to purchase together. I'm a size medium body. 5'7 147 lbs, but my breast are bigger. So although the size was perfect for my bottom, it was small for my top. Had to return, but great purchase, great material."
4.0,"I really like it, it makes my nails look more sexy, and they are fun to wear!"
4.0,"This ring is a good quality for the price.  The inside piece spins smoothly, though not silently.  My son enjoys wearing and spinning it, but it‚Äôs not the right item for a day of school testing."
4.0,"The bag looks great, just like in the pic. I hope my wife likes it!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, however order a size smaller."
4.0,"Inexpensive, look good, feel good, look like they will last a while.  I have a 10.5&#34; length foot, I ordered a 43 size.  My toes are right to the end, but do not go over, my heel as right at the end.  My preference is to have a little more length in a flip-flop.  If I had it to do over again, I would have gone with a size 44.  I recommend going one size up from listed recommendation"
4.0,"I liked this top a lot, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's a little clingy and not as flowy as the pic. I got the 3x, and again it fit, but I wanted it to drape a little more and it did not. Still overall a very cute top."
4.0,"This skirt is exactly like the picture! The colors are vibrant and it's very attractive and unusual! I do wish the bottom of the skirt was more fitted, but then again? it could be that I'm really slim that it fits that way. Regardless, I'm in love!"
4.0,Very cute. Not expensive quality but better than expected.
4.0,Look exactly like the pictures. Stick very well. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the edges don't stick down making theme catch and pull from the skin some. Otherwise I love them!
4.0,so pretty...not bad quality for the reasonable price.  Only problem was the extreme time for delivery
4.0,I can always count on it being what I want.
4.0,Nice design. Fastens well. Bought as replacements for one I lost
4.0,Looks great but is a bit large. I bought it for when I'm riding my motorcycle but it doesn't want to stay up on my face all of the time. This is the second Hoo-rag I've bought and it won't be the last.
4.0,Very pretty.  Hangs nicely.  Nice weight to the material.
4.0,"Cute but Amazon's expected sizing was too small. Order up. (Also quit making dresses so darn small when 70% of women are ""plus-sized."")"
4.0,Material is pretty thin but the fit is good. Good enough that I ordered another pack.
4.0,These are  beautiful. I wish the background under the little studs was silver instead of black.
4.0,"This sweater is cute. Unfortunately the pockets are decorative, rather than being actual pockets. My daughter likes the rabbits, but she's disappointed in the pockets. The size 7/8 fits my 6 year old (who is tall and slim) well, but it is a snug fit, not a loose fit. You may want to order up a size or two. The fabric is lightweight and soft enough cotton to be comfortable without pilling. The rabbits are made of a different yarn that is soft and fuzzy, which is a cute touch. It is a good indoor sweater or spring sweater, but it doesn't provide much warmth."
4.0,Great little tee shirt just order a size up.
4.0,A little small in the chest but everything else fits fine. I thought I was going to return it but after asking a couple of friends they said it actually fit fine and that a little cleavage is a good thing. I ordered the xl and I weigh 190 and am 5'5&#34; and wear an l-xl or 12-14.  The material is perfect and it is lined. It hits the floor perfectly. I think the next one I order will be a xxl rather than an xl.
4.0,"These are more gold than yellow, but still nice. They aren't as long as the picture shows tho. But they still show at the top of my boots as expected. I recommend this seller."
4.0,Decent mag ring. Had a noticeable and positive effect on my carpool-tunnel.
4.0,This garment has a tailored fit and doesn't strike me as being a comfortable top to wear as pajamas.  Still the quality is very good and 100% cotton as advertised.  Bought a couple for my 10 year old son.
4.0,"Wrong size came, ordered a medium got large but quality seemed good either way, just doesn‚Äôt fit"
4.0,Can handle almost everything - except frozen pizzas - but that is not a real concern.  Great stuff!
4.0,"I really like this dress, I just wish I wouldn‚Äôt have gone with the reviews that said to order a size larger.  But it is still Cute!"
4.0,"This item was a little looser than most night gowns I get for my daughter in the shoulder area, but fit everywhere else."
4.0,Un-Stitched basically means un-stitiched in other words you have to put the dress together. Will let you know how it came out
4.0,"Very nice looking watch, kind of light weight though. The color is not as navy as it looks in the picture, and the gold tone is rose. Looks nice on the wrist, and the bonus tool for removing links is a great unexpected perk."
4.0,"I got this to wear at my rehearsal dinner a few months back and it was a big hit. I absolutely love this dress and wear it often now, and I will probably purchase one in a different color/ pattern soon.<br /><br />My body type: 5' 9&#34;/ 5' 10&#34; tall, bra DD 36, 200pounds,  broad shoulders, decently curvy<br /><br />Here at my pros and cons<br /><br />Pros:<br />Colors are vibrant, floral pattern is what I wanted and was crisply printed, I enjoy the length, hand pockets are great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- wish the horizontal hem division between chest and A-line drop was a little lower and a little tighter ( as is it looks a little akward, but is fixed with a belt under the bust, cropped jacket, or vest/corset )<br />- because of the above aesthetic I had a little trouble with sizing and ending up getting both a L and XL.. I went with the XL in the end because belting the L made the skirt less flowy but belting the XL was just right.<br />- the fabric on the chest will show bra underneath. It probably won't do that with the darker dresses but mine was the light green and it shown through<br /><br />Over all I really do like this dress and I'm super happy with my purchase of it! I look forward to wearing it on many a Summer adventures!"
4.0,"Good value, was a bit snug on my thighs but you definitely sweat with it on!"
4.0,Good takes a few wears to be fully comfortable around the toes.
4.0,"My daughter loved these at first, but is now bored with the Frozen themed stuff."
4.0,"I Love it, its cool, and looks great, But the problem is with the lace that comes, so, its sh..."
4.0,I liked everything about the saddles.
4.0,I really like this dress but the sleeves are not stretchy like the rest of the dress and my arms are too thick for the sleeves. The collar and cuffs have overstitching in a darker color which doesn't really show on the photos but I liked it.
4.0,It came smaller than I thought but I already lost one ball because of the one stripped screw but I am fine with just the one in my upper ear..
4.0,"It feels like the right shoe is the correct size, but the left shoe is just slightly too small to be completely comfortable.  However, the shoes are incredibly cute and go perfectly with the outfit I ordered them for :) so I can not say I am an unhappy customer."
4.0,"I bought this for myself for those days that are really rough. It reminds me that I need to just ""Keep going"" no matter what...<br />It had to be adjusted some, which is kind of hard because it's stainless steel, but it can be done.<br />The only Con - is that the black comes off the design if you wear it all the time. (The first ring I bought like this didn't do that but it's also not for sale anymore, so I got this one).<br />I still like it and would buy again, if I lose it, like I did the first one..."
4.0,pleased with purchase.  would buy again
4.0,I‚Äôve looked for these for a long time and was glad to find them. The smallest ones are really tiny & a little difficult to place on the watch stem. But the others are fine.
4.0,"perfect for the beach, especially when stepping on rocks or shells."
4.0,"This is exactly what I wanted. I should explain that I had obtained a very beautiful grandfather clock with a nonworking clock mechanism, and converted it to  battery operation with a radio-controlled clock, a separate pendulum driver, and now wanted a way to reproduce a ticking sound. This device is perfect for the job and now plays a one-hour ticking recording that I have on continuous loop. (The chimes come from a different source.)<br /><br />I can see that the device could be useful for all kinds of projects that need a sound to be played, though the lack of a way to control it externally other than applying or removing current is not a plus. For example, if using an external power supply, it would be possible to turn it on or off by plugging that power supply into an Alexa controlled switch, or just a simple timer switch.<br /><br />Still, for the money, one can hardly complain and I should think it would be useful for all kinds of projects as long as you have a little bit of electronics knowledge and know-how and can figure out how to use the controls and make the connections."
4.0,Some are smaller than expected
4.0,Very nice Ganesha charm. I wanted something on the smaller side. My only complaint is the price...I would probably buy a few more as gifts if it was about $10 less.
4.0,"Very nice suede style band. Product description states it will fit up to 9"" wrist, but barely fit my 8"" wrist. Product used with TicWatch C2, which is a little thicker than a standard watch face, but not enough to account for an inch of length."
4.0,It fits very comfortable. But sheen trim rubbed off after washing and drying. I would recommend to not place in the dryer
4.0,"Love this, the fabric was soft and thick,  price point was great too!"
4.0,"Very comfortable material, like that I can wear with my socks on, however the size chart is a little off. I would recommend the you buy at least one size larger than what you wear, or else you like your sandals to be fairly snug."
4.0,great product and value
4.0,Not the fabric I was looking for.  Good price if it was the type I was looking for.
4.0,"Nice coat, very long"
4.0,This product comes vaccum sealed in the bag and requires a wash to puff and take out the plethora of wrinkles. Other thank that it's a cute and very light coat. It's not as puffy and full as the photo let's on. This coat will not keep to warm it's just a fashion item. The hardware is cute.
4.0,"I sized up just in case, but I regretted it . A large wouldve been perfect, nice flowy sleeves. Loved it"
4.0,"The earrings are as advertized, true blue in color, but a little small for my preference.  They would be great for multiple earrings, but small for one stud earring.  I love them just the same"
4.0,"Good Glasses for my Harry Potter outfit. The circles were a little large, but probably my own fault for ordering the larger size to accommodate my larger head. Would still recommend."
4.0,Good. Fits just right. Good quality for its price.
4.0,"Nice productos for the price, they fell a little light because are ma√≠z from plastic"
4.0,"Slightly to tight at the top, starts to bother my nose is worn too long. But overall good"
4.0,Most pleasing to look at.
4.0,"I'm normally a XL bought a size up and it was still a little snug the first wear. After washing it, it did shrink even more. However, the design and colors were super cute. I would buy again but would definitely size up 1 or 2 sizes."
4.0,"Nice looking shirt, but way too small!"
4.0,My daughter wanted this gift for her grandma. They look exactly as pictured. There even came in a nice gift box. They look like a good quality for the price.
4.0,I really like this but don't expect to be able to make use of the chain or the hook it is attached to. They are both fragile. Otherwise it is lots of fun and even works a bit as a telescope.
4.0,A gift for my daughter and she simply loves them!! A few were pretty snug however very elegant indeed!!!!!
4.0,"size/dimensions not precisely what I wanted. holes in some bags from faulty stitching. Thick material, heavy duty. stiff, hard to bend plastic bottom piece included. the 5 bags come neatly packed in a folder of same material.<br />handles are small and about 1 inch shorter than other similar bags. I will keep anyways."
4.0,It's really such a nice ring. It looks exactly like the real diamond ring I had but for a fraction of the price. The only thing i don't like is the outsides bands do not fit as closely as it appears in the picture. There are gaps that are pretty noticable.<br />One of the diamonds of my original wedding ring fell out so I decided to replace it with this CZ ring. I figure why spend thousands when I can get something exactly the same and use the left over money for a family vacation! If anything happens to thing ring or I lose it I can replace it for less than the cost to replace a tiny diamond I might lose from a real diamond ring.
4.0,"I'm 6ft. And wear a size 10 pants and normally a medium shirt and large if I want it a little big. I got these in an xl because I like my workout shirts to be pretty loose. Anyway. I thought lx would have been pretty big on me....nope fits perfectly, which it not what I wanted üòê. The length is good if you are tall though.  And they are comfy. And the colors are true to the pictures"
4.0,"my girl is using them in some of her Jewelry , Always love HAMSA, as described in description, Works 4 me"
4.0,"I like these wristbands because I have a smaller wrist and they cinch down small enough to actually fit my body. The stretchy fabric is fairly thin, which causes the elastic to stretch out at the edges‚Ä¶ Kind of like the elastic on a pair of underwear that‚Äôs been washed too many times.<br /><br />But overall it‚Äôs holding up pretty decently. I would guess the life on this thing is going to be about six months. I‚Äôm five months in and have noticed I‚Äôve had to adjust it more frequently because the fabric is thinning out, but for the price, it does the job.<br /><br />It was also easy enough to install. I had no problems connecting it to my watch."
4.0,"They were not true to size , so I gifted them to my aunt who loves them."
4.0,This is an absolutely gorgeous necklace!! I am so pleased with it- it looks EXACTLY as described!!! Great seller!!
4.0,"Cute, cute, cute, by dry clean?  Be careful when you wash.  I put it in a delicate ""hand wash"" cycle, as it re ommended dry cleaning.  For pj's????  Still bled a little.  Super cute, though.  Just wash with darks on super gentle"
4.0,"My daughter bought this and absolutely loves it , it is very flattering and would fit most body types. Very cute dress."
4.0,"This is a nice bathing suit, it looks great, I would give it 5 stars but it runs REALLY BIG. My daughter usually wears an XS. I ordered this suit in XXS (4-5) and it is still huge on her, it's so big that I think this may fit her next year too. The back strings are easy to tie up to make it fit but that takes away from the back design a bit. Other than the sizing i think its a decent suit at a great price."
4.0,Very comfortable and stretchy.  Flatters every curve!
4.0,Would prefer had it been a little thicker material.
4.0,It feels like they're doing what they are suppose to do. It's possible they need a bit more padding at the ball of the foot. I still like them.
4.0,"Nice shirt, but fair warning-the size 12!is actually a small. Vendor has excellent customer service!"
4.0,Nice fit was hard to tell which part was the front vs back of the shirt without a tag but cute.
4.0,"Easy to read, large numbers"
4.0,"Just wish the zipper pocket in the back was a little bigger so my phone (samsung s21 ultra, though I had the same problem with my note9 which was the same size) would fit, it would save me having to use an armband or flipbelt on a run."
4.0,Definitely very snug and difficult to get on a size 7 wrist. Beautiful green beads and appears well put together. Will try to find someone who can remake for me because I love the color and the little shamrock.
4.0,My skin was getting irritated from the rubber band that came with my fitbit so I had try something else.  The skin irritation is completely gone with this new band so I am a fan.  Only 3 minor things but not terrible.  1) Sometimes pinches the hair on my arm and I don't have a ton of hair.  2) The band snags on clothing every once in a while.  3)  The band loosens on my wrist throughout the day so I feel I am adjusting it some.  I would still choose this band over the original because the lack of skin irritation trumps all of those 3 things above.  Band is comfortable.
4.0,Item arrived quicker than expected. I dare say that with wear it looks even better!
4.0,"Very flattering for hiding the tummy area, little smaller than I expected but very nice."
4.0,"The corset is so cute. When tightened up the back flap doesn't cover my back, which is ok. I absolutely do not like the stockings. The gloves are ok. I really like the corset though. (It does run small.) I looked over the measurements picture and I went through the comments to try and figure out what size I should order. I'm pretty happy with it."
4.0,"This top can take a minute to really figure out how to put on properly but once on it looks really nice. As I said it can be complicated initially, so make sure to look at the picture to get a good idea of how to wear correctly."
4.0,"Beautiful ring. Nice camo pattern. You can tell where it is pieced together though. But at a distance, not a problem! Nice shine and held up well to everyday wear!! Lasted longer than the relationship did!"
4.0,These were a little too oversized for me.
4.0,Loved the ring except they left the r out of heart. So it says forever in my heat. Smh
4.0,This nylon band is very comfortable on my hand. The band fits to my Charge 4 fine and I have not had any issues with attaching the band. my only complaint is that it is difficult slipping it over my hand to fit on it on my wrist. I wish the band was just a couple inches longer.
4.0,"Nice vest. I am 5'4, 120 pounds, and medium fit ok. Not perfect though. The openings for the arms are way too tight. I don't like fabric so tight around my armpits, in case I am sweating, since the sweat will stick to the fabric. The mid-section fits a little loose/baggy though. They should cut the fabric so the mid-section fits tighter, and give more room for the arm holes. It's a warm, thick vest and looks cute with running pants, leggings, etc. Made in Korea in case anyone is curious. Quality fabric and nice design, just weird sizing and cut."
4.0,The wig was perfect for my costume.  I love the product.
4.0,bought for the future as the kid has everything. Sure they will fit perfectly.
4.0,"I measure a size 11.5 mens, generally wear a 12 shoe.  These are definitely too small, try and go a size up if you can"
4.0,"This costume was ADORABLE on my 3 year old. I order the 4 year size because she is tall, but the pants were MASSIVE on her in the waist. The wig was great and stayed on perfectly for the quick Halloween stroll. This will definitely become a staple in our dress up closet."
4.0,Cute but very fitted
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4114e9058fd9dc551ad353e1609a50a]] 20‚Äù chain
4.0,"Loved it, great fit, love the bright üåû color"
4.0,Alot of pieces . Very useful. Just that some of the balls broke. If u bite on it to much. Dont recommend it but if u dont. Its prefect.
4.0,"Beautiful shirt and I received lots of compliments.  I only rated it as 4 out of 5 stars because the sequins are not secured very well and a lot of them have fallen off in just 2 wearings and 0 washings.  However, the top is beautiful enough to be worn without any of the sequins, so over all, I'm very pleased.  I would describe this as &#34;Patriotic Watercolor&#34; because the roses are like a watercolor painting - absolutely beautiful!"
4.0,Nice. Boyfriend lives. Hoping it doesn't tarnish.
4.0,Nicer than anticipated. Very happy with the product
4.0,My fault but I was disappointed. These are tiny.
4.0,"I bought this bralette to use on hot summer days when a cami is just &#34;too much&#34;. I wear it over my bra and it works as I hoped it would. I removed the pads so the fit is perfect. I did have to order a larger size, thus only 4 stars. I didn't much care for the gem on the front, but that can be easily removed. Overall, I'm pleased with this product and plan on ordering more in different colors."
4.0,"we liked to shirt, I thought it was priced kinda high. My grandson liked it."
4.0,love. Well made.
4.0,"I'm a 38-40DD and in between sizes on the size chart for these bras.  I sized up and probably should not have.  If I lose any more weight, they will be too big.  That being said for the price I paid, I will buy more in a size smaller and the ones I don't wear will make a nice gift!  I have other bras that offer superior support but I paid quite a bit more for them, so I'm well satisfied. I can wear them to the gym while I'm on the elliptical or jogging and the girls are held in place.  I hate the modesty pads because they get bunched up when I take the bra off or wash it, but at least they are easy to remove, so I just don't use them.  I'm super happy about the color options, though some feel a little snugger or looser than others.  All in all, a wonderful bra for the price.  If you're between sizes and you want to feel really supported, I recommend going with the smaller size."
4.0,Cute shirt. It is laid flat to print so the back of the neck on the inside of the shirt has some print on it. This doesn't bother me too much though b/c the shirt is unique.
4.0,"Brought for my mom for a trip to Europe, she likes them a lot."
4.0,"It looks very nice, does have just enough stretch to be comfortable. It is a good length for an evening party, it falls just around the knee. For anybody who needs to decide what size to get like I did, I am 5'4&#34; weigh 124  I bought a size small fits well."
4.0,Sent it back because it drew too small at the opening
4.0,They were ok for the price I paid. I would order again.
4.0,"Vacationing with the fam for an epic- all white photo... here's me and two cousins before the group pic.... u can see them better in this pic.  Excellent fit,really didn't want them to be oversized and too baggy and they were spot on!"
4.0,"These shoes are comfortable. I love the style of the sole of the shoe. Since my feet get swollen at times, the velcro strap helps adjust how tight you want the shoe without having to readjust shoe strings all the time."
4.0,Well made and stays where you set it could have used a set of instructions on how to use the band but I figured it out
4.0,Loooooved this so much. It‚Äôs so comfortable and very lightweight. Great length to wear with leggings or as a dress. The pockets are little weird though. You have to iron them just right to make sure they don‚Äôt poke out and give an odd shape.
4.0,"The cloth is very thin and almost see through, but it is sewn very neatly and worth the price. The fabric is long enough to wrap around the head with ease, and a small amount left. With Bobby pins, can secure onto head well. Overall, satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,"Love the hat, measured  my head, large said to small for my measurement. I ordered  the  XL size and it's a little  big but a sweat band on my head makes it fit. Think the sizes are off on hat"
4.0,"Nice, soft, came on time"
4.0,I haven‚Äôt actually work it out yet but I tried it on and it fit well and looks classy
4.0,"Great Suspenders, hidden under my closes and holds pants up just fine!  Nice product"
4.0,My daughter is happy enough with it.  She collects Pikachu stuff.
4.0,Color is great! It is very long and was a lot larger than the sizing chart suggested. Had to bring it to a tailor. The bow is not large like on the picture. I hate the slip underneath...it doesn't go the whole length of the skirt so it rides up.
4.0,"Cute little low priced  necklace to be purchased for a little girl, not good enough looking quality for an adult to wear.<br />(That's Just my opinion)<br />My 1q year old son purchased this for his best friend in class, & she loved it.<br />I imagine it wont last very long,but it's still worth it for the price."
4.0,This is a really good idea for what I want. Wish it had a coin place that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars
4.0,Be warned the glasses are stylish and come with the effect of receiving compliments. The quality of the frames is impressive and overall great for the price. Really enjoyed this purchase and would recommend to my friends and family.
4.0,"These are adorable and my granddaughters loved them but they had a very strong chemical odor when first opened.  I washed them and it disappeared but I almost just returned them.  If I hadn't told them about them, I probably would have.  The odor concerned me.  They did shrink a little after being washed but still fit."
4.0,Love this dress. It runs a little small. I did size up.
4.0,Overall a good product for average cold weather day.  It was mid-30's and windy this a.m. My ears were so cold. I like the wide band to cover more and to stay in place better. I would but another and recommend. Just be aware not for really cold days unless you wear a knit hat as well to add another layer to your ears.
4.0,I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but I was looking for one for this dress before I bought it and there were none! This dress is adorable; I love the way it fits and looks on! However‚Ä¶ it is see through. Nothing a light colored slip or spanx cant fix though!
4.0,"I'm 5'1, 95 pounds, 34c. Bought a size small and it's very beautiful and exactly like the picture. It's a bit big at my waist but I can taylor it"
4.0,"My 8 year old loved the designs on these gaiters, but unfortunately they are a little snug for his large head (his head is the same size as his moms). Wish they had a little more stretch to them, but the colors are great and I'm sure it would work well for an average sized kids head. ;)"
4.0,Perfect fit all the time with Hurley!
4.0,Super cute just is a more fitted top was hoping for a more relaxed fit .
4.0,It runs large
4.0,This is my second purchase of portable blender but different brands.<br />I really like this product for use. Bottle is made with glass which is big plus and size is also big enough.
4.0,Super lightweight. Great for a hot summer night. Hands smaller than pictured.
4.0,Opened pkge and put on snd product started started shedding all over floor EMBARASSING/ given as b/day gift/ disappointed!
4.0,Great floral dress for a resort/beach vacation‚Ä¶Very nice and flattering.  True to size.
4.0,"I like these belts but with one qualification. The nylon material looks very sturdy; it does not look like it will stretch out of shape. The buckle, while being plastic, seems to be sturdy and certainly fastens tightly to the belt itself. My one hesitation is that the plastic buckle does feel  kind of cheap.  It looks OK but is not high end.  I appreciated having three different colored belts in the package that arrived; it‚Äôs nice to have these color options as I‚Äôm sure that I will use each belt often. Recommended."
4.0,This shirt is very cute. Fits as expected. My only reason for missing a star on the review is that the shirt pilled up a bit after just one wash. But overall I really like the fit and feel
4.0,"It is extremely small ,it fits on my wrist but it looks like a miniature watch. It needs to have a better description"
4.0,"Got these for my 18-year-old daughter who says: ""Weird material -- it's very elastic like. However they are lightweight and comfy, plus they are cute, too. I enjoy wearing them."""
4.0,Very nice. Color is nice.
4.0,The belt fits like it should. Its very cute and well made. Goes well with a lot of clothes. Cute !
4.0,"Nice lenses, could be better. They didn't totally fit the frames at first, and smudge/scratch easily. They look really good though and I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"Not super well made, but functional."
4.0,"Not the best quality, but what can you expect for less than $10. It's a versatile layering piece for someone on a budget."
4.0,Cute dress! I put a slip under it to make it vintage! Haven't worn it yet! Saving this one for a date with the hubby!
4.0,Decent shorts. Fit as expected.
4.0,It‚Äôs not a sweater but they fit nice and look awesome
4.0,Works for my 11-year old but too small for my 14 year old
4.0,It fit well but im hippy so the pockets stuck out but loved the print! And the pockets came in handy for graduation to store under my gown!
4.0,Worth the buy- Thanks for a great shirt for supporting a great man!
4.0,Convenient nylon knock around women's bag
4.0,"These socks are very comfortable. They really work to keep your feet fresh and dry.  Yet they are even more absorbent than cotton!  Like all bamboo socks, they are sooo soft and light weight.  And, they do stay up.  I must admit, I have purchased another slightly more expensive brand that are a little thicker and possibly a bit more absorbent, which is why I only gave four stars.  But, these socks are still great and I would recommend.  You can't beat the price!"
4.0,"Pretty decent product. It arrived in a timely matter, but no it doesn't have all the colors shown in the picture- I received 2 blue, 2 green, 4 silver, 2 pink and 2 rainbow which I'm still pleased with. The color does chip if you're not too careful with it but that's to expected of any product. I put it in my rook and it looks great!"
4.0,I have got so many compliments on this necklace! Im a barber student and wanted something to go with my barber appeal! The perfect gift for a barber!
4.0,Very nice well built and worth the price.
4.0,"Good quality wallet. No issues after a year of use.<br />My only complaints are the button, and excessive amount of slots in the outs folds making the wallet thicker."
4.0,Bought this for a sibling at a baby shower and got size she wears. But this shirt is much too small. Really cute though.
4.0,"Giving it 4 stars, I love the belt and the skirt. It‚Äôs a little long on me. I expected it to be a little bit more fitted and not almost to my knees. But maybe that‚Äôs my bad for not looking closer when I purchased. All in all good quality skirt though!"
4.0,"While I like these, I'm pretty sure they're just a little too small... I ordered these as 00g, and they're smaller than the ones I've been wearing"
4.0,These are big and sassy and fashion<br />Love how they look but they do squeeze my head pretty good- and I have a small head. I can only wear them for short amounts of time and won‚Äôt leave them sitting on top of my head like I normally do with sunnies. If the earpieces were more flexible these would be perfect
4.0,A little on the small side but is a nice shirt
4.0,"This dress is very nice. I got the yellow with blue flowers. It's bee soft, falls nicely and fits as expected. I'm 5'5, 135 lbs and I ordered small which fits perfectly. Material is soft. Prefect for summer wear..<br />still think the price is little too much .."
4.0,Great value. Well made
4.0,"Other than the color being a bit lighter and brighter than I expected, the fabric is very light weight (I think it will be perfect for hot days) I would be worried about a lighter color having issues with being too thin though. It is not my most flattering dress, but does not look bad, and I only plan on using it for a ""stay-home"" day."
4.0,Decent. Washes ok except the liners move all over the place.
4.0,"I ordered the apricot in a small and while the top is very comfortable, the color is a yellowish beige.  I did not like it all and will return for another color."
4.0,"A gift. Have had one for a couple of years. If this is worn daily, the finish will begin to come off and a 'coppery' look will appear. Do not use silver polish on this or finish will come off. This bracelet contains a quote that I hold dear and am thankful to have it on a bracelet."
4.0,"With the soft lace fabric insert at the neck, to me it looks and feels more like a lounging top rather than a top to wear in public. So, that is how I will use it.<br /><br />Edited to add: After reviewing the top, the seller immediately contacted me and gave me options to make my experience better. So while the product wasn't exactly as I had anticipated, the customer service was outstanding."
4.0,"I would caution that this shirt runs a bit small.  I ordered a large hoping to have a really oversized shirt.  However, it seems to run small.  Vivid colors and fun graphic."
4.0,"Very flattering dress, and I‚Äôm a large so that‚Äôs üòÖ good. Very comfortable, quite stretchy. Wore this all throughout my pregnancy, loved the fit always. Just runs a little long."
4.0,I loved this item. The printing was perfect for my husband. He also loved it. Bright color which was stable after one washing hope it continue this way!
4.0,"The downside is that the sleeve length is kinda short. Overall, seems like I will love these."
4.0,It's ok but I have to carry a lot of cards & it makes it bulky even though it is small. I think I will return it for a bigger wallet.
4.0,"Oops, I should have read the description better. I didn't know this was a clip on. Oh well, it still stays on pretty good for a clip on, and it looks beautiful."
4.0,"These are nice hoodies, but Babolot clothing runs small."
4.0,"I should have looked closer at the dimensions. I bought it for a little girl who loves owls but it is rather large. I have no problem with the item, it is nice, just a little out of scale. My bad, not the sellers. The price is right. Ships from China, so not real fast, but acceptable."
4.0,"Overall they're nice comfortable socks. The top elastic part is a little loose for my taste, but some people might like it that way. I'll make any edits I need to over time if the sock starts falling apart."
4.0,Gave these as gifts to confirmands at church.  Love the Scripture verses as they will be meaningful to the young men and women.
4.0,It's a great office bag for working men not need alot of files and papers. Will buy again
4.0,Very nice quality and well made. Should be a little bit loose though.
4.0,Very nice shirts but run big
4.0,"An excellent Pajama.  I have been looking for something like this awhile.  Being in Noth East, with indoor temperature is around high 60 to low 70, this Pajama keeps me warm. It also has amazing texture, soft .. it says made viscose... not sure exactly what that is. But it gives pretty heavy feel.<br />CON:1.  NO FLY ... I wish it did. I don't understand why.<br />2. Its waist band is a bit loose. It doesn't fall but wish it has more traction.<br /><br />Having said that, it's a good one. I plan wearing it for a long time to come."
4.0,"I bought these instead of Coobie because so many reviewers said that Anemone bras were the exact same, only cheaper. I have one Coobie bra and I absolutely love it. I don't think these bras are as good as Coobie, but they are not bad either. In the future I will just buy Coobie, because I know that that is what I like, even if Anemone is much cheaper. Coobie has a softer material and is more comfortable in general, but Anemone is nice too when you compare it with an underwire bra!"
4.0,"Fits as expected, good snug compression shirts"
4.0,"These earrings are so comfortable that I forget I have them in!  Answering the phone or sleeping while wearing them is also not a problem.  My only complaint is that the earrings are no where near as ""shiny"" as the picture shows.  They have more of a matte or brushed look to them.  As long as the finish is not an issue for you, these are a great pair of hoops!!"
4.0,I sent back another pair of riding pants and got these. These are substantially better than the other options I found on amazon.<br /><br />They are a little heavy so you will need a good belt and/or clip them to your jacket.<br /><br />Much more protective than regular jeans but not as protective as racing pants. Good medium
4.0,These slippers fit as excepted and are so cute. My daughter has not had much out of them yet so I can not comment about the durability.
4.0,I like the material I ordered the green and the color is very nice. It runs small.  I am 152 pound and size 12 is too small.
4.0,I just received this coat and after reading the reviews I ordered a size up. I'm usually a small/medium but I got a large. It's actually a little big... I think the medium would have been fine. I gave it four stars because I haven't tested how warm it is. I love the look of it.
4.0,"Very pretty,  but a darker brown verses rose gold.<br />Very sparkly,  but not every day wear."
4.0,They were very good just didn't like the gift wrap on it
4.0,I work outside and this is perfect for phone free calls and music. It really keeps your head warm to.I am out in really cold weather to and my head is warm always. Its loud and clear to.<br />Put your phone in your pocket and go.<br />Clear talk and listen to.<br />Worth it and easy to connect in seconds.My daughter wants one now lol.
4.0,"The earrings were exactly what I was looking for.  They are post earrings, not the dangle-like earrings seen in the picture but I knew that from the earlier reviews and thought they were worth buying! Happy with the purchase."
4.0,Would get five stars if the bow were attached more securely to belt.
4.0,"Great top. Material is great for summer, but too short to wear as a dress which is why I originally purchased. Easily pairs with leggings and jeans so that problem was solved. I would suggest hang dry."
4.0,would have given 5 stars but instead of 2 key chains one was a necklace & just had to re order 1 only & pay again<br /> I did not contact seller though
4.0,"A bit smaller than expected, but still beautiful and arrived on time"
4.0,"Good fit but quite high. They look very cute on, but my feet hurt every time I wear them."
4.0,good quality. well made and attractive
4.0,"These face masks are very comfy and have bright, beautiful colors. They are not very thick, you can still breath comfortably through them and I love the shape that contours to my face. The only small issue was that one of the masks was defective and wasn't even shaped like a mask so I had to throw it out."
4.0,my wife loves it and it looks good on her
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:cc1a470f1db79cefb539d06743979e33]] It is a comfy band, but the install wasn‚Äôt super intuitive. It‚Äôs also not the easiest to put on but I still like it."
4.0,"I got it blue lens but not as happy with the color, wish it had chosen a regular lens color, other than that it fits perfect."
4.0,The prefect addition to my littlest Elphaba costume!
4.0,"Great product, I use it in sub temperatures and it sucks moisture great."
4.0,Nice material. Good fit.
4.0,"This skirt is super cute but, the sizing chart on the product description is way off. My waist is 29 inches. So, I ordered the extra small which is indicated for 38-inch waist. (I was wondering how that was going to work, but I took a gamble.) It fit me, but it is right on the waist, and I would have to maintain perfect, sucked in stomach posture in order for this skirt to fit at this size. Not comfortable! I am going to return the extra small and get a medium. Besides the sizing issue, this is a very unique and pretty skirt!"
4.0,Love it!!!! A little bit boxy in the shoulders.
4.0,"Loved the quality of the glasses! They arrived with no scratches on the lenses or bends/crookedness. Many reviews said these glasses are plastic and cheap (for costume use only), but the glasses I received are sturdy, durable, and made of metal.<br /><br />I would recommend a small for those who want to wear these glasses as an everyday look. Medium-Large would be great for a costume (silly/exaggerated look)."
4.0,Very cute for a child chain Is short overall it was worth the money paid
4.0,"This shirt fits well, but is a lot shorter than expected. It is sheer, so you need a shirt under it. I was hoping to wear it with leggings, but it's way too short, even for a 5' 2&#34; person. The back barely reaches the top of my jean pockets."
4.0,"I love the size of them although, for some, they might seem too big. They are big so if you want big, these are the glasses for you. The one negative for me is that they are super tight. The slip back on my head from how tight they are. Hopefully, they will get loser with time."
4.0,"i love YMI Juniors Wannabetta  butt Triple Button skinny jean, i have multiple pair in multiple colors they all fit great! I ordered this pair in black and my goodness the waist is way too tight! they are the same size as the other ones i ordered at the same time, maybe they came off the belt wrong? all i know is these are smaller in the waist only, than the same ones of another color"
4.0,"These are nice shirts, but I wish they had a little more compression and that they were a couple of inches longer."
4.0,I honestly love this product. I have poor posture and this is a great tool to help correct it. My first hour use left my back and shoulders feeling AMAZING. I only give it a 4/5 because it's almost mandatory to have a second person to help get it in exactly the right position and keep it there.
4.0,"I love this glasses only because I look cute and a geek at the same time. However, it breaks easily. Not surprised looking at the price."
4.0,Am happy. Fit as expected
4.0,"I have had my nostril pierced for about a year now and I've had several different studs in them. The only kind I feel comfortable using so far are the L shaped studs, too, I guess because that's what my piercer used. I have been wanting to try hoops since I got my nostril pierced but just never got around to buying them. When I came across this set of five multi colored stainless steel nose hoops from Zhenhui, especially at such a great price, I immediately ordered them!<br /><br />The nose rings arrived very quickly in the mail after I ordered them online. They came in a hard plastic case and each individual nose hoop was wrapped in plastic. There is a silver, gold, black, blue, and multi colored hoop. I adore the multi colored nose ring because it matches the bar I have in my industrial piercing. I noticed right away that the bars looked a little bigger than the bars in my standard L shaped studs. When I compared them side by side, the bar for the hoop was more than twice the size of the bar in the L shaped hoop, despite only being one gauge less. I still tried inserting the hoop, hoping that it wasn't a big enough difference and I could stretch it but there was no use, it wouldn't fit whatsoever in my piercing. I really love the hoops and they feel like really good quality but unfortunately they just didn't work for me.<br /><br />I would still highly recommend these for anyone that has a lower gauge nostril piercing, though. The colors are beautiful and they feel like really great quality especially for the price.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review."
4.0,"Watch has been great--simple, basic, and NOT HUGE (which seems to be where fashion is heading, but is not my preference). I had a problem with the band after a couple months and the seller was quick to reply and offer a replacement. Extremely satisfied with them and the watch."
4.0,Nice for cool nights in the summer
4.0,"This was purchased as a lunch box for my young son.  It comes with an easy grip handle, but would be better with a should strap option. The Sparty logo is stitched to the front and is high quality.  The material is a durable canvas which makes the product easy to clean, which is great with children.  There are two separated storage compartments that are insulated and can keep items cool throughout the school day.  The main compartment is 9&#34; x 6&#34; and zips closed.  The bottom compartment is only 3&#34; (which I wish was deeper) and is great for sandwich containers.  It also secures with a zipper.  There is a small zipper pocket in the front for silverware, napkins, etc..."
4.0,The product is fine. It is light weight and casual dress. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the pockets in the dress were not stitched properly at the seams and both had large holes that your hands could go right thru.
4.0,"I like the material, definitely a quick dry. The only problem I had was the yellow shirt is slightly see-through if stretched, so I'm sticking to the darker colors"
4.0,"My 6 year old son loves his new water shoes!  Great fit,  great color.  Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"I have purchased multiple dresses in different colors! for very functional!!<br /><br />Fantastic sun protection, Light weight, Quick to dry, Easy to pack, Made with quality in mind, And I receive compliments every time I wear it..<br /><br />I went for a larger size on my second purchase for extra sun protection and ease of changing out of bathing/wet suit on the beach,<br /><br />Unfortunately Coolibar doesn‚Äôt have their sizing down in inform fashion - appears sizing varies across design  and lot. I have a prime membership so returns are easy. I no longer buy directly from Coolibar due to sizing issues & retturn cost."
4.0,"I purchased this due to being a fan of Game of Thrones.  It is simple, yet beautifully made.  The blue and brown leather really bring the dragon out.  It sets beatifully on the wrist.  I orginal bought this for a friend to have, but now I am thinking of getting something else for them.  This piece really draws the eye and is a  conversation piece.<br /><br />Note : I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest review and opinion."
4.0,I like it after one bracket broken and had to return it.
4.0,"The colours are beautiful and they are super comfortable! 4 stars because I wanted to stretch to 1/2 inch using these but, they feel and wear exactly like 7/16 gauges even though I ordered the 1/2 inch size. I'm not too annoyed because they still fit but would've liked the 1/2 inch I payed for."
4.0,kids liked them
4.0,Fits well !! Nice material though is thin but it does keeps body warm !!
4.0,Really cute. A little tight if you‚Äôre busty. But overall happy.
4.0,Received lots of compliments on this necklace.  Very different.  Would buy again.
4.0,Cheaper looking material than expected
4.0,Definitely fits as a junior‚Äôs large would. I‚Äôm a 6/8 and would have been better fitted in an XL. Super cute though!
4.0,"Material is a little thin and cheap, but OK quality for the price."
4.0,"I bought this wallet for myself, this is my account, not Robert's, and I am his wife.<br />I love the wallet.  Frankly, it doesn't suit.  Not enough room for cards and change but I do not care.  I am sick of my huge wallet!  This is nicely maid and easy to use."
4.0,"Love it. You can tell that this is a cheap baby bag, but it definitely works.Sturdy. Plenty of space. Plenty of compartments. Easy to clean and wipe. Love it."
4.0,"I ordered this shirt for my son who is in the auto industry. The colors are those of the company and he does some racing as well. This shirt is perfect for that. He loves that there is white on the sides, which makes it look sporty. It fits well for him, is lightweight, and dries quickly. I was a little put off by the handwashing instructions. We don't put a lot of shirts in the dryer. So we are washing it in the machine and drying on a hanger. He loves it!"
4.0,This dress is comfy. Like wearing a big snuggie.
4.0,Perfect for someone that has few cards and dislikes carrying cash.
4.0,Adorable I love them but they are smaller than I expected. Will purchase more.
4.0,"Really cute, and exactly as pictured. Only issue is the plastic headband is shipped separately from the lace bang with the ribbons and cat ears.  I expected some kind of sleeve in the inside of the material to slide the plastic headband in, but there isn't.  I will likely use hot  glue to attach the material to the plastic band."
4.0,"Nice material, looks as expected, although I've ordered S and it seems to be about 4-6 size, so it's too large"
4.0,"The ring is very cute, however I haven‚Äôt been wearing it for more than 3 weeks and the silver color is wearing off of the edges to show the black underneath. I might buy another one in a solid non-Metalic color later, But the fit is true to size it just isn‚Äôt lasting"
4.0,My daughter like them.
4.0,A bit large but otherwise fun socks.
4.0,Pretty& easy to stretch
4.0,"This is my second Vario Elastic strap.  I do like them a lot for the comfort they offer. Only drawback is if you do use it often, they tend to fray in the holes and on the edges."
4.0,"I purchased this for my 11 year old, and I know she will love it (birthday coming up). I think this is a great gift for any girl/young woman who loves the violin and music. It's a nice chain, and the violin and treble clef have a nice little sparkle. It's not super long, but I think that it would fit pretty much anyone."
4.0,"This is a easy and cheep way to protect my wallet, I use a trifold wallet with this in the paper money fold, so this wraps around my cards, and I can still use my wallet of choice."
4.0,These worked well in adding to my vest
4.0,"If I were a jogger, I would not be wearing these pants, unless it was below freezing. They should be classified as heavyweight. I ordered based upon lightweight and therefore will be returning. They are of quality materials and appear well made. I can not give 5 stars due to inaccurate description, and sizing. I ordered a size larger, but even then they were skin tight. Not something I‚Äôd be comfortable lounging around in."
4.0,Fits perfectly.  Recommend wear without a tie because of small collar but may not be a problem for sizes above small.
4.0,To big I need a 2x
4.0,It was delivered quickly and was just as described.
4.0,"Nice color, pretty good quality, surprisingly opaque for being sheer. Doesn‚Äôt sit quite right on the body but it‚Äôs still flattering. For the price a great deal. Smells a bit smoky, but I‚Äôm sure it fade with a wash."
4.0,I like that you can dress up an outfit without all the added layers! They fit nicely around the neck and keep their shape as well!
4.0,"Great price, fits a little on the snug size."
4.0,"There are many sellers; finding the right ones takes much work. I tried two other open-toe breathable slippers before ordering this one. The size fits perfectly, as if the slippers were custom-made. The flax insole is comfortable to wear all day. The outsole is durable and flexible. I like this pair of slippers.<br /><br />I have noticed that all the sellers used the soles from the same manufacturer. The insole is contoured instead of flat; this is a plus. The differences are the uppers added by the sellers, the sizes, the colors, and the prices. This seller offers more sizes, and the prices are more reasonable.<br /><br />The material of the uppers is pretty rough and irritates the skin. I had to attach a Band-Aid to the underneath of the left upper. The seller should have installed smooth edges to make wearing the slippers more comfortable."
4.0,So covinience!
4.0,It fit really well and looks good on.
4.0,I think the size are for baby.
4.0,"So this Yeepsys women‚Äôs sports bra is definitely not for anyone that‚Äôs above a size B cup size! Not because it doesn‚Äôt support them, but because I am a size c and mine were legit bulging out of this. But the bra fit everywhere else and I ordered my usual size in this sports bra.<br /><br />If it would have fit my size c though i would have liked this. The material isn‚Äôt super itchy or scratchy, and they have decent support. Plus it‚Äôs basically a long line bra so it stayed down and was comfortable. Overall for the price this is a really good value as long as your an A or B cup, other wise don‚Äôt even try!"
4.0,Nice but wish it was longer.
4.0,"I relly liked these, but I had to return them because they were too small"
4.0,"Super cute charm, necklace broke so I just put it on a different chain."
4.0,"Girls loved them! they are lightweight and breezy, which is nice for summer."
4.0,"Saw these glasses on someone else, and had to get them. They're cute, but can easily be scratched."
4.0,"I love this dress.  It fits me like a custom fit, hug my small curves beautifully. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a slip on, over the head. Other than that this dress is a solid &quot;10&quot; I first saw the dress when Princess/Duchess Kate and Prince William went to India and I just knew this dress was for me. As usual anything I am in search of I can find on Amazon!"
4.0,"I love the shirt, feels like good quality and true to fit BUT I have washed it and hung dry and the folding wrinkles will not come out and it says do not tumble dry or iron?"
4.0,Cute Swim top!
4.0,2 of the shirts fits good one was smaller
4.0,Either I got a huge head or this hat is tiny.<br />Sound is crisp and clear. Perfect for audio books.
4.0,"This is a good watch, but for a couple of dollars more, you can purchase  Casio Men's F105W-1A Illuminator Sport Watch, which is about the same, but much easier to read in the dark."
4.0,Love the material and look great. The only thing is that it unties itself sometimes so I had to do it again.
4.0,I love it. Took a little while to get here (longer than expected) but I am very happy with it!
4.0,Like the quality. Like the fit
4.0,It seems they work as told
4.0,Very nice. Glad I got them. They look very stylish. All my friends tell me how good they look.
4.0,I wanted the Frozen shirts but when I push for her size they didn't have it I never noticed that it gave me The Sophie shirts but my granddaughter still liked them.
4.0,"The ring didn't look like the one presented, with the black ring and diamonds. But It's still a nice little ring. It's not as comfortable, but I can handle it. The shipping was fast I really liked it."
4.0,"The elastic on other brands bothered my daughter. I‚Äôm glad I found these,cute designs and reasonably priced. Not as soft as the much higher priced organic underwear however."
4.0,"The only reason I give it four star is because the fabric is really thin so it might not last long so beware if you get this. But, it fits well. I'm 4'11&#34; with semi-thick thighs and it reaches a little above mid thigh when pulled up to full length."
4.0,"Good pair of cheap sunglasses, not as nice as the last pair I had of these. They're sturdy though, not very good at all for protection against the sun. I also have a small head to begin with and they still fit kind of snug. Good for $4 though."
4.0,"Size info skews large, but child should grow into it. Fabric is soft and clean"
4.0,It really is a cool hoodie. Looks like the picture and love it... Don't know how it will wash but very pleased with it!
4.0,So glad you have these charms.  So cute!!!
4.0,They are very nice. My wife lived them.
4.0,I love the coverage and flattering style.
4.0,Beautiful glasses but I‚Äôm not sure they suit my face well
4.0,"This is two large keychain wristlets, they are well made and a great price. I recommend giving them a try, they hold up wonderfully."
4.0,These are great for gifts and prizes. That being said‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt super sturdy when stretched.
4.0,"It is exactly as it is pictured, and fits well (can be adjusted)."
4.0,"Foot fits fine but the ankles are a little tight ‚Äì it feels like my akle is wearing a turtleneck.<br />Very padded and cushy on the bottom and the toe ‚Äì which is where we like it<br />They keep my feet warm, and have held up over several uses thus far.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Recommend them, but if you don‚Äôt like ankle socks these may not be for you."
4.0,"My head's a size medium, so maybe it's just me, but it's a little tight. Otherwise, I like how it fits and I like how it looks. The felt is nice and soft.<br />Don't rough house with this hat, though. The material makes it so it's not the sturdiest. But this isn't a hard hat for construction, so that's not a complaint. As long as it doesn't dent on it's own, I'm fine. And no, it doesn't. But if I poke it, it can dent. I did this on accident grabbing it, but was able to correct said dents. Again, don't rough house with it.<br /><br />There's not much else to say. It's a good value and the hat is cute. Perfect for a cosplay of Serena from Pokemon X and Y."
4.0,"I love leggings with side pockets and had hoped these would work for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô tall with 34‚Äù hips and the S were too big. The bottom of the leggings were loose and did not hug my legs which gave them a weird look, the waist was too big and hips were also too loose. If they came in XS I would definitely reorder in the smaller size. They were a bit thicker, so it doesn‚Äôt appear that there would be peek through while working out, bending, etc. they seem very comfortable and come in great colors."
4.0,Beautiful.  Fits perfect. As described.
4.0,"These are okay leggings with a pocket on the right leg (thought there were two pockets when I ordered, but not a big deal). I originally bought them for runninng and they're not great for that. The inner seams tend to rub my inner thighs raw. They don't come up as far as I'd like them to and the top tends to roll down when I move around. Also, the gray pair fits a lot better than the other two pairs, which makes no sense.<br /><br />Probably a decent legging for light yoga or wearing around the house, but not great for distance running."
4.0,Bought to match the yoga outfit
4.0,[[ASIN:B01I8J953W Tyzon Solid 925 Sterling Silver Luxury Heart Shape with Cubic Zirconia Women Sterling Silver Necklace]]<br /><br />This product arrived early in the time frame which was very pleasant. The necklace came in a cute little protective box. Stone is clear and very clean. Love this necklace.
4.0,comfortable shoes but I had to give them to my daughter bc they were too small. Order a size up!
4.0,Good quality. Nice graphics
4.0,"Quality wise, what you see is what you get. But my son loves them and won‚Äôt take them off, so it‚Äôs worth the 5 bucks. THESE RUN SMALL! I ordered a size up for my kid and it fit, but with zero room for growth. Also, they don‚Äôt show the sole in their pics: it‚Äôs just material with a small dots pattern for MINIMAL SLIP GUARD. We still have to be careful on the stairs because they don‚Äôt grip the floor at all."
4.0,Fit right in all the right spots!<br />I am 5'7 150 with a 36D chest
4.0,"The product arrived on time. It was beautiful, the color was beautiful, the fabric was nice, and it was modest (it's exactly what I was looking for). My only problem was the sizing. Which was mostly my fault since I should have known to size up since it's a body con style. I won't be able to wear it to the theater like I had originally planned, but I was able to use it as a gift. So everything worked out in the end."
4.0,this shirt was a little snug! but it was very soft and felt great.
4.0,Great watch but the band isn't that great. Still a solid purchase for a good price!!
4.0,I love this for comfort and ease! I wear a size 18 and am 5'6&#34; 200lbs. I bought the Large and its plenty roomy but I wish I'd bought the XL for a looser sleve. The sleve fits fine and doesn't cut at all but I wanted space between the sleeve ope i g and my arm. Next one I get will be XL.
4.0,"I got this as a gift, it fits very well. Good quality."
4.0,I liked it.<br /> Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt chose the fit size since I‚Äôm losing weight these days!<br /> However I‚Äôm planning to buy another one once i reach my ideal weight
4.0,"This is a very lightweight sweatshirt. However, I love the way it fits and looks! Perfect for summer evenings!"
4.0,I did expect them to be a little bit bigger but these are basically underwear on me
4.0,"Had to send first order back and order larger size, because short in torso. But it is nicely made."
4.0,"These are a nice big size but mine were bent and hit my cheek bone on one side , bummer!"
4.0,Gift for daughter.  She wears when needs to dress for occasional dates etc. and says it fits and is comfortable
4.0,The t-shirt is really cute! Love the design and the fall-like colors. It fits a little larger than my typical medium sized shirts but it‚Äôs ok. I definitely plan on wearing it on Thanksgiving and I have a cute outfit planned for it!
4.0,comes with multiple filters and circulates air well with the fan.  Only issue is that its hard for people to hear or understand you as it muffles you as well.
4.0,The skirts are very lovely and I am in love with how they fit on me. I ordered a small and two out of the four fits perfectly and I love it! However I am noticing that all four skirts don‚Äôt come the same size as stated because two of the four fits perfectly and the other two fit as if it is too smaller than the others. I don‚Äôt think all four skirts have the same size and that is the ONLY reason why I didn‚Äôt give 5 starts and the ONLY flaw that I have towards them.
4.0,I love this purse. Material feels good. Just the size i was looking for and the small pouch is a plus. The only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because the stitching isnt great so just be careful of the amount of weight you put in and the strap could have adjusted to be longer. Other than those things i love it!!! Wish they had more colors because i would purchase them all.
4.0,Inseam run longer than expected. Waist is true to size
4.0,"This is a cute costume dress for sizes 4 to 6 years. It has an underskirt hoop skirt beneath the shiny one so that it hangs out away from the child's legs. The hoop is made of plastic and is 21 inches across at the widest point. The hoop underskirt is made out of a pink gauze fabric. The outer dress has one side with a purple satin under layer with an iridescent over layer. The other side is a pink satin with silver glitter designs on the front. The back is fairly plain. There is a Velcro closure at the neck. There is some elastic around the waistline and the back of the torso area is made of a stretchy fabric, so the dress will expand some to fit. The dress is made from 100% polyester. It does fit my 3.5 year old niece, but it's clearly meant for a child that's a little bigger than her. She loves the look of the dress, but she prefers dresses that don't have a hop because it's a little difficult to sit in chairs or even on the ground and play with toys when you're in a hop skirt.<br /><br />Care instructions: hand wash cold with like colors. Turn inside out. Do not bleach. Do not wring or twist. Lie flat to dry. Do not iron."
4.0,these glasses fit well are great for the price definitely not polarized as much as some of the higher end glasses... but overall nice shades i have 2 toddlers at home and go thru glasses very quickly these i am very happy with
4.0,I really like this one because it stretches.  Comfy
4.0,A Little smaller than I would have liked but quality!
4.0,"They look good on my shoes, so many people ordered after I gave them information, the price was just right"
4.0,"This review is for SPIEZ Gym Shorts for Men Running Shorts, 2 in 1 Workout Shorts Men with Compression Liner, Quick Dry Shorts. This short is now my go to shorts for working out. I ordered a medium grey and it fits me perfectly, being 5' 7"" (1.7m) with a 32"" (82cm) waist. I had previously worn other compression pants but they were the long kind for doing yoga. I was so glad to see this combination of workout gym shorts with compression shorts built in. It really has met all of my expectations in terms of fit, style, and comfort. I've been wearing it almost daily during my workouts and I am very pleased with how it performs. I like that the compression short does not ride up against my thighs and is very snug but soft, comfortable and breathable. I'm not sure if it has moisture wicking built in but I am relatively dry after my workouts. As for the quality, I think it could be better in terms of stitching. In the attached pictures, you can see how the right side seams appears to stick out a lot. It could be just this one that I received and not a general issue. I thought it was because it was new and unwashed when I first received it but even after several washings, it still sticks out. Upon closer inspections, I did notice how the left and right side stitching did not quite match. Other than that, it went through several washings and still looked great - no shrinking, fading, or other loose threads. Just be careful with the drawstring because you can pull it straight out from one side to the other. Other shorts that I have usually have the drawstrings sewn midway by the sides so that you cannot pull out the drawstring completely. I have to remember to tie the drawstrings before throwing it into the wash to prevent it from coming out of the holes completely. I like the drawstring itself though because it does not look like a shoestring. The back pocket zipper was nicely sewn and looked very good but I think it is a little shallow for my use, being about 2"" deep or so. I also thought the front pockets were extremely shallow and I could only fit 1/2 of my hands into the pockets. I normally like my pockets a little deeper so that I can stand around and chat with people with my hands in my pocket. However, with it being so short I really don't know what to do with my hands. LOL I did not use the hand towel pocket because I sweat a lot during my workouts and there's no way I'll be feeding the towel in and out of the tiny hole that often. I don't think it is really necessary for the type of workouts that I do but it might be useful for flag football types of sports. I did put an iPhone 10 into the compression pocket and ran and jumped around and it held pretty solidly and stayed stuck to my thigh. However, I didn't do this everyday because I prefer to not carry my phone with me on my workouts. Overall, I am very pleased with this shorts and I use it almost daily now. It has really become my favorite shorts for working out. Just know that it is made in China, as so many things are these days, so set your expectations accordingly. Overall, there are some improvements needed but it has met most of my expectations so I would recommend it. I might try their Spiez branded shoes to see if this is a good brand but for this particular gym shorts, I'd give it 4.3/5.0. - 08/02/2022"
4.0,"While this watch is quite nice for the price, the description says it is teal. In reality, it is much closer to Kelly green. I was buying it for a little gift for someone who wears teal on Tuesdays for ovarian cancer, but will keep this one for me and find another for her.  If you are looking for a Kelly green watch - go for it - it is cute!"
4.0,BUY THE SIZE YOU WEAR
4.0,Really nice looking earrings that go well with a necklace I also bought on Amazon.
4.0,"Ordered on Oct 14, received on Oct 26 - just in time for Halloween! Like other's have said, the material is cheap, kind of slinky like. At the fabric store, it's the stuff that's $2/yard. The spikes are in the same realm of cheap-o looking. That being said, I wanted this for a costume, and it will be perfect for that once I add a few finishing touches. Also at $10, I can't really complain about the quality. As for fit, I'm usually a US size 4 to a 6, and ordered this in an 8. It fits fine. I followed some other reviewer's advice and sized up, glad I did! I'm 5'6&#34;, and the length is good - not too short, nor long."
4.0,first time ordering something like this and I love it! very sexy and for the price if it gets ripped off I wont mind ;)
4.0,"A bit more than your classic gold hoop. These are thicker and they look heavy but are very lightweight. Plus for being so lightweight, negative for being a little too thick, gives it a fake look."
4.0,They are beautiful but way to big ... So my baby will have to eait to use them
4.0,A loose fit but cute!
4.0,Gets tangled as you move around but it is very pretty and sparkles
4.0,"They're a bit see through, but if you're wearing a long shirt, it won't matter."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but runs 2 sizes too small! I had to return it.
4.0,"Overall this was exactly what I was looking for, but its tight.  I wear a 10-12 and I bought an XL and its not terribly long and still a bit tight.  Yes it should be tight to be sexy but it also needs to go past the hips without getting stuck.  Its not about going up a size its just the fit, if you are more hourglass shaped, it will hug odd areas.  I still gave it 4 stars because its super sexy, I have to wear leggings or a mini skirt under due to the shorter length but its still super cute."
4.0,The hat part was a little bigger than I expected but the fit was perfect
4.0,It's  good handbag..
4.0,Funny panda
4.0,To short for women 60 and over
4.0,I love this on my fit bit but wish it was adjustable. It‚Äôs a little big.
4.0,Loves these socks everything about them
4.0,I like these earrings and have received compliments on them.
4.0,Great sweatshirt but it runs small
4.0,Comes in a cute little burlap sack. Handcrafted item. Nice colors. Fits well on my small wrist. Looks like something you would get at a festive craft show.
4.0,Love the way they look. The back of the glasses however is a bit painful on the head. If they could add a little extra padding by the ears these would be amazing sunglasses!
4.0,I normally wear a small top and medium bottom and they were both small but they still work just a little tight. Especially if you have a big bum. Very cheeky too. Good material!
4.0,Very pretty & shiny stainless steel.  Only thing is my fault.  Should've ordered one with a classier chain.
4.0,The straps popped off‚Ä¶reinforce the stitching! Hence why 4 not 5 stars. The style is cute and comfortable.
4.0,I never knew what a difference simple socks could make. These are so soft and warm and comfy. I love them. The only downside is that they shed even on the first use.
4.0,"I'm about a size 10 & ordered the XXL. Loosened the back as needed, fits great! Stinks that the string is in the middle but if you adjust it right, works perfectly! Great buy for price!"
4.0,I was so excited when I ordered these earrings. Nice earring but they were a little too small for my liking but it's my mistake since the size was already said on the title of the earring. Other than that I think the earrings look great.
4.0,Love this bag super trendy and decent quality.
4.0,Ran a little large.
4.0,These work but not as good as I had hoped
4.0,These dresses are as pictured. Go with the size Amazon recommends. Think they could be less expensive. Price a bit high for something so casual
4.0,"This is a clear plastic tote which is made out of the type of plastic which works best if you feel it before use with something such as paper‚Ä¶ Towels‚Ä¶ Etc. You do this so that it will expand to the full size. If you wait until the last day, it is just going to be flat and hard to place items inside.<br /><br />I actually have a different clear bag which I like better, because the plastic is soft and very flexible. You do not need to place anything inside so that it expands. The problem is, I have no idea how to tell when someone is selling such a tote if it‚Äôs going to be the soft plastic or the more stiff plastic like is being sold on this listing. But certainly if you can find the ones made with soft plastic that‚Äôs the way to go."
4.0,I do not recommend sizing down. Better quality than I thought it would be! Fits a little awkward but is still super cute! The bottom portion is a little see through.
4.0,Nice Cap!
4.0,I bought this heart necklace for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it. The only thing was the chain did not look sturdy.
4.0,Exactly what I expected except for the color. I was expecting more of a raspberry color like the picture but it's more of a red.
4.0,"So cute and unique! I got very many compliments on it, but it did break the first time I wore it. Hopefully with pliers, I can try and fix it..."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress!!! I‚Äôm delightfully surprised on how nice, lightweight and how flowing this dress is. I often struggle with keeping off the shoulder clothing from popping off my shoulders, but the elastic around the top and arms keep the dress secure and I don‚Äôt have to keep adjusting it."
4.0,The bottoms are quite baggy and I ordered a large which is my actual size. Ordered a similar outfit from another company on amazon and the shorts fit perfect. Love the outfit though but I don‚Äôt think there was a way to order a smaller size shirts since it comes as one outfit.
4.0,Cute top.  I've gottenots of compliments on it.  Its light weight & soft.
4.0,A mi hijo le gust√≥ mucho solo hay que tener cuidado por que es algo sencilla
4.0,My hubby loved them! He mentioned needing some thin low socks to wear and these worked perfect.
4.0,"This seems like a super sturdy watch, I'm sure it'll last forever. The only reason I'm subtracting a star is because the bars holding the strap on were incredibly difficult to remove. Also, I replaced the strap with a NATO strap which makes it way more comfortable, but make sure you get 18mm if you decide to do that, I accidentally bought 20mm and it was impossible to get on. I then realized my mistake and got 18mm, which was still very tight."
4.0,Color is accurate. Fits normal sizing.
4.0,These shoes are really nice and pretty comfortable. My only problem with them was there was a point on the zipper that was stabbing my heel. At first I thought I was just getting a blister since it was my first time wearing them but after 10 mins of wearing them I noticed that my heel was nice and bloody :(. I filed the point down and now they are great. I was just a little disappointing that I would have to do something like that to a pair of brand new heels. Other than that I like them and got a lot of compliments on them
4.0,"I honestly have not experience to compare this to, but here goes....<br /><br />Easy to use. Fits well in my under seat storage (2011 Street Triple) along with a tiny tool kit and a multitool. I'm still a little annoyed with the multi-step process of helmet life (a little more than just locking your car as you walk away from it) but the enjoyment of the motorcycle absolutely outweighs the pain of locking up a helmet.<br /><br />BUT: if anyone wants your helmet bad enough they'll find a way."
4.0,"Cute fitting dress, but the fabric is rather thin."
4.0,A little too big but the girl is growing
4.0,Love the fit and style. I would order a size down for this dress. I ordered my size and had to use a safety pin so it fit properly (not enough time to order a different size)
4.0,cute pants my 7 year old loves and they are lower quality than the designer that makes similar ones but age appropriate!
4.0,"Don't know if I'd buy this again. My previous watch was hanging up when putting on a long sleeved shirt or a jacket. Not a big deal normally but I have shoulder damage and that really was painful. This watch is a lot thinner and stopped the interference. However, it's so small it looks child like. You'd think that being this small would let it be easier to read at night, but no. The illumination is pathetic. Doesn't even light half the face. Useless. Although it does what I bought it for, the rest is a failure."
4.0,These are cute! Looks just as described. Some of the pendants on one ofthe anklets started falling off after a few days. That was the only downside.
4.0,"Me gust√≥, muy bueno y bonito"
4.0,These are great and I've used them many times. Hold up great and are definitely worth the money.
4.0,This is a pretty ring.  Just wish the chain was up on the top a bit more.  When your wearing it the chain falls so you cant se it.  If it was located a bit more on the top side of the ring I think it would be better.
4.0,"Not cashmere, but better than I expected for the price. I am 5' 2&#34; 130 lbs and this is not huge, but covers well. Nice knit, only complaint is a lot of static electricity in it, but<br />That can be a problem with any knitwear in the winter"
4.0,"The watch was a little difficult to program, but, once set - it's perfect.  My grandmother has poor vision and this watch works exactly how we wanted it to.<br />We did change out the band to a more easier to use band.  However, there wasn't anything wrong with the band it came with.<br />I would say the watch face is &#34;man-size&#34;. A large face for a woman with Good vision. But perfect for my grandmother."
4.0,"Really thin material, but works for the price"
4.0,It‚Äôs cute it just runs small
4.0,"I really liked this for my septum but it is on the smaller side so every time I put the ball on, it was pushed up against my nose which if I even wiggle my nose a little, the ball popped off. I love it, I just wish it was slightly bigger as to not have that issue with the ball."
4.0,"nice necklace, I like the size of the cross too."
4.0,"I ordered the royal blue for my daughter, it matches her dress very good. It's a little bit smaller than her other bras of the same size."
4.0,"Could not open the clasp to connect the necklace, ended up damaging it to be able to wear it."
4.0,Purchase for my dad and he absolutely loved it . It had great color and has not faded.
4.0,The material is very soft. The compression was not as much as others I have. The crotch area tended to be a little loser. Length is great. Not a bad legging but I wouldnt put these at the top of my list. Not sure what all the rave is about
4.0,"Received these dresses in the mail and they were exactly what I expected. I was happy to see these were made from a quality cotton mix stretchy material, and not that cheap looking shiny polyester material most dresses/club wear are made from when you order from manufacturers in China. Just a note‚Äî-The material is thin and not very forgiving so if you have a few  pounds you need to shed before summer time, this item may not be for you. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the purchase and purchased this dress in all colors."
4.0,"I really like the sports bra. It‚Äôs comfy, cozy and doesn‚Äôt fold under the breast while working out. It is also very airy, which is great. I just wish the bra straps adjusted more to make it a little tighter. I am a 36D and this is one of the few sports bras that actually hold me the girls down. Usually I have to worry about my boobs giving me a black eye when I run or excercise and with this bra I don‚Äôt have this issue."
4.0,"Very Pretty Honu Earrings on Abalone Shell.  Due to shell variations, you won't get one that is exactly like the photo.  Mine is more pearly white than brown.  But very pretty."
4.0,Just exactly what I ordered.I would recommend this to anyone who likes football and money clips.
4.0,Would buy again! Great dress for the price!
4.0,"Up close and mid distance are great but walking in them is almost impossible.  Hopefully I will get used to them but if not they are still great for what I need, reading and computer work!"
4.0,"I'm 5'11"" ,155lbs and bought the XL. It fit well but was too short in the torso. It felt like I was being pulled down by the shoulders and collar. Other than that it was cute and got lots of compliments."
4.0,They what I expected.
4.0,"Thread count is a bit light, but otherwise well made."
4.0,I gifted this to my mom as the medium is better fit for her. I ended up buying XL which made a big difference. After a month or so I am very pleased with the products. Just wished XL came in different colors like this orange. I should jave dollowed my gut and got bigger size and not read too much into other peoples reviews. Once you're a big youre always a big head lol.
4.0,"It looked really small coming out of the bag, but there is a fair amount of give to it. It's comfy and gives a good amount of support."
4.0,I thought it would be longer. but it turns out the higher in size the wider it gets... oh well still like it.
4.0,"The size on the outside package was not what the swimsuit itself was.  It stated L but the swimsuit was 3XL.  Sent it back and reordered a smaller size.  Ordered M this time - guess what I recevied?  XL, so I did a little sewing and it fits fine, now."
4.0,The gloves are very thin and small. So I would definitely say for kids younger than 2 yrs of age
4.0,"These are nice. They are bigger than I expected. They are earrings that I can only wear for a night out, not all day, because my ears are sensitive but they were perfect for that.  They look nice and dress up an outfit."
4.0,"It fits well , I really like this hat .  But the marijuana symbols is crooked ."
4.0,"Very nice glasses. Pattern is very pretty and the glasses fit well, however frames are large on small faces."
4.0,"It‚Äôs ok,but it was supposed to be white and rose gold, not white in black. But good quality!"
4.0,"I bought two of these for my kids. They were shipped promptly. Once I got around to washing them, the girls gave them a shot. Both of them loved the style, which I initially worried about (because they‚Äôve yet to use this style). It fit well around the face, with no issues in regard to breathability. They are stretchy enough to move where you need it, but they also stay in place, without restricting. They survived the washer, no problem, without bleeding, fading, or tearing apart (so far). Would definitely buy again."
4.0,"Fits my fiance great, packaging was super fancy for a belt. Love the little black strap thing on them to hold extra belt out of the way. Pretty long, so it'll fit a lot of people. Nice, sturdy material too. Feels like it needs to be worn in a little"
4.0,"These clips seem to be pretty well made, just make sure you pay attention to the size of the clips... I didn't pay enough attention and I didn't realize they even made tie clips this huge.  Was my own fault, but these won't work for any modern ties that are even slightly slim."
4.0,"Minus my kids initially breaking the chain, I was able to finagle it and I love it. I get compliments all the time!"
4.0,The ONLY reason this is not a 5 star is because the watch band was the wrong size for my Pebble.  The quality of the band is excellent and is solid and heavy.  I wish they had one for my 14 mm Pebble.  In spite of my delay and being past my time for return the merchant satisfactorily and expeditiously resolved my issue so they get 5 stars.
4.0,Classical with all the subtlities of great craftmanship...
4.0,Great for skiing - did not slide down in boot.
4.0,"These are great yoga capris - I'm a petite so they are a little long but still totally work.  To note I personally prefer a lighter material when exercising, but these are still a great pant, especially if you like a thicker more substantial pant. Would also work in the winter as a great legging type option under dresses and skirts. To note the heather-ed or flecked effect on these I did not like in person as much as I did the photo.  Just be aware the color (heather hunter green) is not as dark as the photo may appear. I also got a pair in raisin and that color was as expected, nice and dark yet still a good pop of color."
4.0,"I really  didn't  like the stocking, dig into my calf of my leg. I had take them off after 2 hours of use. Became very uncomfortable."
4.0,Great deal for x3 iwatch bands. Nice smooth and sleek. I love the skinny shape of these bands.
4.0,"Very comfortable sports bra, but looser than I expected. I am a 34DDD in most regular bras and I originally got a size small and it was too loose to use for running. I ordered an x-small and it had the right amount of compression for me. If you size down then it's a great bra for the price."
4.0,Nice and big
4.0,Really comfy.  I‚Äôm ordering a second pair.
4.0,I think this is quite cute<br />And well made
4.0,Super cute and Stylish
4.0,These are really petty and this earrings in good condition.
4.0,very low cut
4.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these (both L/XL).  They are kind of tough to put on but once on my legs and feet feel good while wearing them.  I do like them as they are kind of funky looking and not as boring looking as plain old black socks but they don't seem to fit quite as snug and stay up as much as other similar compression socks that I have recently purchased but they are ok.  One pair fits just fine while the other pair appears to be 2 different sizes. I didn't really notice until after I wore them so it didn't want to go through the hassle of returning one pair of socks.  I have seen these offered my multiple vendors so I am not sure who actually makes them but if you do buy them, just make sure each sock in a pair is the same size before you wear them."
4.0,Not a compression shirt just a slightly snug tank top. Comfortable enough. Don't expect it to suck up your gut or offer any support but it does it's job.<br />Your milage my vary.<br />Fyi I ordered the large.
4.0,"Purchased these for the beach. Bought the women's XL, girls 7-8 & boys 8-9. The fit seems to be right on par, good quality material and only minimal sheerness due to the background being white. The womens' has cup liners to help combat any sheerness or just showing too much detail. the girls has removable shoulder straps which is nice to add extra support when playing but could make it look exactly like mommy for pictures. The boys shorts ARE NOT board short style as listed. they are the tight fitting spandex style that is more popular outside of the US. Not a bad product, just not what I was expecting and my son wouldn't wear it. Everyone loved the look and they were very comfortable."
4.0,It‚Äôs stretchy and cool just be careful taking it off cause it looses tightness I had to sew it to make it small again
4.0,This dress is beautiful. When you wash it you should air dry it and pick the size up .
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I didn't like the feel of the fabric as much as others dresses I bought like it, but the quality was pretty good still."
4.0,"I ordered a couple of these - one for myself and one for a gift. They arrived about a month later, intact, despite shipping in just a small bubble envelope. Each pair was in a separate cellophane baggie.<br /><br />They are MUCH smaller than depicted in the photos. It may just be luck of the draw, as each one is handmade out of polymer clay (a couple of the petals have fingerprints on them). The petals on the two I received are not as flared out, making for a smaller and more closed up flower. They are large and showy in the photos online, but in reality they don't really extend significantly past your earlobe.<br /><br />The earring backs are little rubber stoppers, not proper metal backings.<br /><br />They're still nice, but I will be gifting both pairs, as I was hoping for something larger and more showy for myself."
4.0,Its got a nice material and shipped fast although I'd recommend ordering a size down as my normal size was slightly too large
4.0,Pack was what I expected. No loose threads. All zippers worked .
4.0,"LIGHT, LIKE WEARING A FEATHER...VERY SHARP...VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER"
4.0,"They work well with my Garmin watch.  And if they break, I'm glad to have 4 more.  They did come a few days faster than projected for shipping, however, I now see they are available through Prime, which they were not when I initially ordered them.  Yay for you all, boo for me lol."
4.0,It is ok not what I expected but it is not that bad
4.0,"Earrings are beautiful - several compliments.  Only complaint is that the posts are thicker than expected, which made it difficult to put the earrings on and left my ears feeling sore.  Wish they were thinner/normal."
4.0,"I like the comfort, excellent quality & perfect fit!"
4.0,it.s longer than i thought it would be.  it is exactly as described i was in error in my judgement .
4.0,They are good ... I love them
4.0,"I found a pair of workout capris from this brand at Marshalls, and they've become my absolute favorite to work out in: Comfortable fabric that's actually opaque, high waist WITH a drawstring, and the perfect length for my 5'3&#34; frame. I bought those in a size Medium, and they fit perfectly (145#, 30in waist, thick thighs/legs, longer torso, pretty straight up-and-down). When I saw these on Amazon, I purchased them immediately. As soon as they were delivered, I tried them on and wore them to that night's workout. The pros: The material is super comfy and isn't see-through at all. The inseam was great and didn't make my thick legs look like stumps. The cons: I ordered my normal size Medium, and while they fit comfortably in the legs/thighs, they are too large in the waist. I was pulling them up constantly during my HIIT class, which instantly made me forgot their positives. They do have a high-ish rise, but I would have preferred at least an inch higher (wouldn't solve them being too big, but it's a start). I suppose I could try them in a smaller size, but I'd risk having the legs be too tight and the rise would still be an issue. I can see why so many people like them, but my search continues..."
4.0,"it has the wrong kind of ankle hook,first time I wore them to church the hook broke,so now I have find a shoe shop that might can fix it,never want another shoe with this kind of hook really bad had to walk around in church with one shoe  not buckle,very very pretty shoes I think the maker need to come up with a much better hook. veronica from columbus ga"
4.0,I bought it for a gift. Think my nephew will be happy with it.
4.0,The case arrived on time. It came with a RODS logo glued to the front of the case. Good construction.<br />However in ordering this I noticed $10 shipping & handling ( $50 ) I returned it aand had to pay another $10 for returning it.
4.0,Good length. True to size. Seem a little pouch I‚Äôm the front but I think it‚Äôs just me. In the mirror they look fine
4.0,Yeah something that is LONG enough for me. Happy!
4.0,Just got my tongue rings. I didn't have any duplicates which is great! I had one ball that came shattered. But that's ok.
4.0,"Can't beat the price. They are indeed polarized. Fit my face well and look good. The case they come in is pretty top notch, I actually use it for my real glasses now, almost worth it just for the case. I would buy again for cheap knock around driving sunglasses."
4.0,Wife loved them.  However had to fix upon arrival as one post was bent.
4.0,"Have not really used them yet, however they are very comfortable and we are going on vacation soon and they will be wonderful"
4.0,It's Beautiful. But it doe's run very small. My daughter is going to turn 1 year in March 10 & I order a size 1. My daughter is 22 pounds. Its small on her
4.0,"I have these leggings in 3 different colors and I love them, but one pair i have came so much bigger than the rest. I‚Äôm not sure what happened with this pair but the sizing isn‚Äôt consistent. Though I love these leggings, I can‚Äôt give it 5 stars because of that. Picture of my 2 newest pair to show. The pink pair is perfect, but my ombr√© set is so stretched out and I‚Äôm not sure why. Both brand new, never worn"
4.0,I like the ear loops! The black one is nice and soft...just wish a bit thicker. Double the cotton material to perhaps make it safer as protection.
4.0,They fit well and the inside is a soft material but provide little to no arch support.
4.0,Pretty pattern and great quality. I has to return it because my top half just didn't fit.
4.0,"good dress, soft fabric, and all in all a good product. The only complaint I have is that you can see the sems on the chest part of the dress, and its in a place where you cant move it to the side or just wear it differently. Still worth it for the price."
4.0,I like it. I wanted it for a thumb ring and it looks beautiful!
4.0,I ordered the XXL but most of my shirts are xl.  These fit more like an XL.  The quality is nice and they are well made.<br />They look great compared to some polos out there. I recommend them but order one size larger than norm.
4.0,Love all the beautiful colors in these scarf.  They go with a lot of my clothes. Wish it was a little longer.
4.0,Shinny fabric on outside.  I prefer a matt knit doubleknit fabric.  I really don't care for them.  I guess what I was looking for was more of a fleece/flannel or double knit cotton fabric.  I am a5 ft 5 with longer legs and these were pretty long on me.  I should have gotten the 29 inch.  The style is very nice.  I wish they were in another fabric.  I like natural fibers if possible.
4.0,I love the Thalia White Pearl Necklace.  I wear it with many outfits.  I thought it was a Chan Luu bracelet but I decided to keep it because the fit is better than my other Chan Luu Bracelets.  It doesn't feel as constricted.
4.0,Chain is cheap
4.0,"This is a flattering suit, although I found it to be a little snug from my normal fit. The tummy control is great (mom of 4 üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), but I did find that it flattened my chest from the side view. The back is flattering also! Probably size up for the best fit!"
4.0,"The bust area was somewhat smaller than expected, though the shoulders, arms, skirt, waist, and length are wonderful.  I bought an XL and am a 40D. When I wear a minimizing bra, it's okay.  The buttons are hooked with stretchy loops, so that helps. I love the look and feel of the dress.  The material is lovely and the flowing skirt is fun to wear."
4.0,For my face they sit on my cheekbones so that's kinda annoying from the remarks. But put a little nose Guard on there and should lift them.
4.0,Definitely worth the price shipping took a while but not a big deal I love getting my costume jewelry at such good deals.
4.0,"These are perfect for hanging out in and possibly Yoga, but not compression fitting for Pilates or exercising.The fabric is more like a tee shirt rather than the compression spandex I am used to. But they are very soft and surprisingly, they looked like they were too small but fit well. The only thing is, I need High Waist (as advertised) because I have such a short torso; I never seem to be able to find pants that come up to my natural waistline. One pair I purchased is perfect, the other pair is not cut quite as long so it falls on my hips like hip-huggers and would definitely show &#34;butt cleavage&#34; if I wore them to work out. For the price, and the cute colors, I would definitely order more."
4.0,"Received fast. Product as described. Each lanyard individually packaged in small zip bags. Great value! I wish opening one side of the the clip didn't also open the other side as well, but still, a great value and quality item!"
4.0,"Cute little hat for my wife for this winter seeing it is almost a hundred degrees out right know other thasn trying it on and making sure it fits not much else to say.

4.0,"I gave this to my daughter as a graduation gift. It was exactly what I had been looking for. The pearl is beautiful. She loved it and wore the necklace during her ceremony.<br />It comes boxed very nicely and with certificate. Also, it was delivered a day before expected. That's always nice!"
4.0,Beautiful piece. Just be careful if you have small wrists... Will slip off if not tightened a bit (which is tough because it is so solid)
4.0,It's very great material but the tush fits kind weird.
4.0,Perfect size. Not impressed with the locking screw. Serves the purpose. Fast shipping and delivery.
4.0,Seems as though it will protect the watch pretty good.
4.0,Pretty vibrant purple color but the material is a little silky and a hot to sleep in at times. It also easily snags.
4.0,"Love the look of these on but it took some time to get use to putting them on when you have the chain attaching the front and back together. You don't have but a small amount of chain so you have to keep them very close. Once you get use to it though, it's not a problem. They are so adorable that they are worth it.<br />Arrived quickly. Great price."
4.0,Good quality. Good price. Though I didn‚Äôt except it to be a men‚Äôs ring I still like it. (Size 7)
4.0,"If your goal is to not have a sunburned head/face, this hat will certainly do the trick. And the mesh does sort of provide air flow, so it doesn't get super hot. So, in terms of comfort, this is a pretty good hat.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the hat sort of collapses onto your head, as another reviewer, noted. Because the middle part is mesh, it doesn't stand up. Instead, it just sort of falls onto the top of your head. The end result is sort of a Charlie Brown aesthetic. If Charlie Brown were an old man playing golf or sitting at the beach, this is exactly the sort of hat I'd expect him to wear.<br /><br />I'm not generally all that vain, but I am thinking of getting another hat at some point because I do think it's very unflattering. If your main concern is comfort, however, I do think this is a good hat."
4.0,This fit as expected. Was exactly the color and fit I wanted. Only dislike is it smelled like motor oil or something when it arrived and immediately had to be washed .
4.0,"Loved the fit. It was a little long, but I'm petite. The dress still worked well for the occasion.  The dress is on the sheer side."
4.0,Pretty good costume quality.. I just wish it was a bit bigger. It ran too small for me so I had to return it.
4.0,"I received the multicolor ring, and ordered it slightly large (size 8) to wear on my index finger and thumbs. It fits true to size, and the ring is very pretty. The rose gold, silver and gold look great together, it's much more subtle than I expected. The ring stays in place, and it looks great mixed with other fashion jewelry. I really love how smoothly it rolls, it's great for my anxiety induced fiddling! For how cheap it is, definitely recommend. The only thing I don't love is that the seams on the rings are really easy to see, but that could just be a ""me thing."""
4.0,They are very comfortable Footwear nice fit
4.0,I bought these for my son and was totally impressed when I opened the box.  They were super cute shoes!  They were just HUGE on my sons foot.  I would be prepared to order a size smaller or do an exchange or 2 to find the right fit.  I ended up not exchanging when I noticed they didn't fit and just returned them because I found something else in a store to purchase... but I definitely will buy these again down the road and order small.
4.0,I usually wear a large I ordered xl could've worn xxl shirt runs small but I love it looks just like the picture shown.
4.0,Sweet little dress but fabric not what I expected
4.0,It's cute.  Ordered down a size since it's very baby doll.  Glad I did.
4.0,"This is a really nice, large tote style purse. It looks as though it is constructed well and will hold up over time. Two straps, so versatile to carry"
4.0,"This is a cute tee shirt dress.  not too light like some dresses in this pricepoint, but not too heavy.  Good fall weight.  The pockets are on the side seam, not the front.  its nice having a little pocket.  the height of the pocket is at the waist to  just below the waist,  but not on the hip which is good, so its comfortable and flattering.  I'm 5'3&#34; and the length is just above the knee.  Since I'm an XL-XXL  i'll wear this with leggings, grey or navy and grey boots."
4.0,This is a great bag for the price! Very comfortable and holds a lot. Only knock is that the lining has started to fray around the zippers after only a couple weeks. But it's cute and functional for casual weekends.
4.0,High quality dress.  And its just as cute when it gets to your home!
4.0,This item is nice.
4.0,These lenses fit my monster pups from oakley perfectly. The clarity is great and the people at new seek were very helpful. I wish they were a little darker but in all they are great for the price.
4.0,"I like these a lot, they are super lightweight so they won't hurt your ears. The pattern is really interesting and I think it will make a nice accessory to outfits!"
4.0,"Used this during an extended recovery from surgery.  It kept everything covered, but didn't make me hot.  Love the pockets!  They are perfect for the drains and tubing.  If it had been softer, I would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,"graphics are cool, fits good, not crazy about the polyester, but it will look great at the QUEEN concert tonight an cheaper that a concert T-shirt!"
4.0,I wore this with black leggings (because it was a little too short) as I got my hair and makeup done for my wedding.
4.0,"This is a perfect fit. It looks nice, but it is not real leather. It does the trick. I took the lanyard off and attracted a retractable clip on it so it wont be in the way while I'm working."
4.0,"I have my moms wide hips and carry my weight in my stomach. I am 5'2-5'3 And 160-170 weight wise The pants come high on me (around my stomach). It could be from My build. But the length is good and would work well with a heel. The pockets are excellent. I would recommend going up a size or two if you have wider hips and a tummy. Pants are nice and airy for the hot summers, and fit well."
4.0,"Slightly darker than the product photo, which is fine. The gold buckle matches the partnered watch perfectly, although the gold (at least by the photos) stitching is more of a dirtied white. Fits well, will be comfortable once broken in, but doesn‚Äôt look or feel like genuine leather.<br /><br />For the price, I am satisfied. Anything was better than the factory gold bracelet."
4.0,Need different bold colors. Not only just gray.
4.0,A little impressed with this crown. No jagged bottom edges and a pretty thick crown. Not sure how it would fit on a toddler head unless it was just for a tiny bun type. I‚Äôm actually going to attempt this on a newborn.
4.0,When I use this cloth some residue ends up on my hands. I'm a tiny bit concerned about this since I don't know exactly what it is.
4.0,"I loved this bangle, I'm hoping it does not turn."
4.0,"I really like these, but I am sadly returning them.  I bought the 12 month size for my 9month old granddaughter to grow into them.  The size is good, except that the arms are quite snug.  I don't mind things fitting snugly, but I'm afraid they will be too tight after washing."
4.0,"Purchased the light pink and it‚Äôs slightly see through so keep that in mind. Other than that, super cute!"
4.0,"This wallet was a little bigger than I expected, but it looks nice and has a goodly amount of pockets, so it stays slim.<br />I would say it would not fit in the average front or back pocket, but would tuck away nicely in an interior jacket pocket.<br />I keep it in my courier bag purse. It doesn't take up too much room. It is not really a minimalist design but it *is* a vast improvement over my previous wallet that had certainly put on inches with age."
4.0,"Made very well and nice fabric.  However, they're fitted not loose as shown so size up.  I wear a small.and got a medium and they were fitted.  I'm.going to try a large extra large for a loose paper bag look.  I'll update soon.  Nice product overall but sizing is an issue."
4.0,"I love the design. It's foldable too.<br />The polyester reinforce bottom not only blocks UV(says in description) but also gives some weight. So I don't have to worry about the wind.<br /><br />But it's not quite cool and breathable despite of the linen and cotten material.<br />Maybe the polyester lining in forhead keep you warm, I guess?<br />Also I think the price is little high for what it is.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'd buy it again."
4.0,Their cute for a little one who still needs assistance to walk.
4.0,It‚Äôs a pretty dress. Unfortunately I had to return it because it was little long for my girl.
4.0,"I like the material of the bodice-feels like a velvet material, which is nicer than my daughter‚Äôs dress. It is a little roomy in the torso. Depending on brand, I‚Äôm usually a size 2-4."
4.0,I wore this to dinner at 20 weeks pregnant with twins and I loved it.
4.0,"Good for at home wear, pockets are unnecessary and do not give a slim look. I will remove them."
4.0,"Loved that these match the earrings perfectly. Came on time, chain is a bit thinner than expected. Beautiful, simple & dainty. Very feminine. Great seller. Would make future purchases."
4.0,"It's just what I wanted. I'm 5'1, 105lbs, small-framed and I ordered a small. This fits loosely, but as I wanted for the beach. I definitely didn't find it to be too small, like others said. It wasn't scratchy, and I didn't find the neck/seams to be itchy or stiff like others said, but this could just be because it was loose. It definitely isn't meant to keep you warm, just be a light coverup or cute addition to an outfit, I suppose. I deducted one star because the color looks slightly different from the picture. I ordered black floral, and it looked like it had more reds and blues, but it was kind of pink and purple. I'm just not a pink kind of person. But it's still cute, and I wore it and got compliments, so it's fine. It was still pretty vibrant, which I was surprised at."
4.0,would have rated a 5 but the hats keeps slipping back on my head.
4.0,"This is very nice and trendy! Get tons of compliments! Overall it could be made a bit better, not sure how long it will last"
4.0,"This glove is very elegant. I'm very petite, yet, found this pair of gloves to be difficult to get on as they are very tight in the wrist area to get your hand into the glove...that why I gave it four stars. The fabric was spot on! These are gorgeous."
4.0,"Good quality, excellent fit. Company even emailed to confirm<br />shoe size so conversion  from inches to centimeters would be correct."
4.0,"I have a rose gold Versa 2. I tried the regular gold band and the ""colorful"" band and didn't like how they went with my Versa.  If you have a rose gold Versa, you want the LIGHT gold band or the rose pink. I'm pleased with how they look with my Versa."
4.0,Its nice it's not the one in the picture though
4.0,These jeans are great for the price. Comfortable and flattering. Wish they were available in different colors.
4.0,Fits like they should above knee cap
4.0,I returned this dress! The color is so much brighter in person.... very orange as opposed to peach. It runs small but fits well.
4.0,Good material I think they run a little small but one size up when buying they are a fresh meteial good quality
4.0,"These were a great value for 6 pieces.  They have held up pretty well to repeated washings.  The edges  on some have unraveled a tiny bit (after months of use), but it is not a big deal.  Overall, I'm happy!"
4.0,My daughter love it she wear it Avery day.
4.0,They‚Äôre super cute but a lot chunkier than expected. They would be good for kids
4.0,This dress is very flattering. Ilike the pattern. You can adjust the ties at the shoulders for a custom fit. But it's shorter than I thought. It's above the knees. So I had to turn return it.
4.0,Las tallas no son exactas
4.0,My daughter loooooovvvvvvvvveeeeeeessssss this shirt. She has been wearing the shirt for the last 2 days and refuses to take it off. It is her favorite.
4.0,"Color and design were as described. A little tight in the check, sizing was not consistent through different designs of the dress."
4.0,Overall I loved there. I only wish they were a little tighter. They are a little baggy.
4.0,Finally received the bracelet I had first ordered December 3. It is a good looking bracelet. I hope my son likes it and that it fits. I'm certain that the mix up on my first order was due to human error and that can happen and the  late delivery on this order was winter weather related. Happy that the problem was resolved and the bracelet was received.
4.0,"Nice stretchy top, but arrived in a regular Ziploc bag with a piece of scotch tape over the top. Not very secure."
4.0,Colour was a little dull not as bright as like picture. Its very stretchy I'm a size XL and that's the size I bought will size down on next purchase to a large however I didn't  bother to return as a like it I will figure something out and dress it up one day or maybe just give it away.
4.0,"These work well, are a bit thinner weight than other brands and good value for my husband. Bought a size Large he wears 10.5 shoe."
4.0,Runs 2 sizes to small but I knew that from the other reviews. The fit was a little odd for me. I gave it to my daughter and it is cute on her. The material is a little cheap in the sleeves.
4.0,"Bracelet is just as described, shipped fast and last long, made of high quality to avoid wear from day to day"
4.0,"love this, just worried it will tarnish.  metal seems bit cheap, but I will keep wearing it until it is ugly!"
4.0,It is flexible as mentioned<br />If the width of belt is little smaller it would help me
4.0,Inexpensive and cute! It came fast.
4.0,"The fit runs small, but I recut the neck and stretched it out a bit. If you don't want to fuss around with reconstructing your shirt but a sz larger than you think you need."
4.0,"I just received these earrings today and they are beautiful.  Perfect size and lovely design, I can't wait to make them a staple in my day to day accessories.  The posts were a bit bent/not straight (my reason for giving 4 stars), as I saw in other reviews, so I very gently straightened them and they seem fine.  They arrived in a small plastic bag, not attached to the paper as pictured, but the paper is enclosed in the packaging."
4.0,Cute dress! Good price
4.0,I think using a fashion belt would make it look better on the body. But the fabric feels wonderfully cool and soft. What a great value. Grace Karin products that I have ordered all so far have been amazing.
4.0,I'm bottom heavy. These are a bit too tight to wear unless I have a shirt that will totally cover my butt.
4.0,Nice color and quality is good but not terribly soft. Could be a bit less scratchy against the skin.
4.0,"I was so hoping to love these and I almost do. They appear to be very well made, are attractive, and fit well. I‚Äôve spent $$$ for progressive lenses that didn‚Äôt look as good. However, the correction field seems a bit off. In order for my far vision to be clear I have to look slightly to the left of the object I‚Äôm trying to focus on. Near vision is excellent so I‚Äôll keep them tho am disappointed they aren‚Äôt perfect."
4.0,A little thin on material but otherwise not bad.
4.0,The dress fits great and I like the look. My only complaint is that the belt should be longer for larger women. I couldn't tie the bow big enough to make the impact that the picture has. Other than that I was happy with my purchase.
4.0,Awesome shirt! But the material is suuper thin.. Already accidentally ripped a hole in it before I could even wear it
4.0,"Nice, well made little purse."
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous earrings. They're a little larger than I thought they'd be, but they were packed very nicely (in a small jewelry box, each in an individual bag, extra earring backs in another bag, and a pink mesh bag was included for more long-term storage)"
4.0,Girlfriend really like it but the chain is a little on the TINY size.
4.0,More of a travel bad than a purse for me but I did like it.
4.0,"It's very pretty, fits well. Glad I got it"
4.0,I used thee as part of a necklace and they were the perfect size for what I designed.
4.0,"Beautiful style but the down of the dress looks cheap. A little bit tight on the neck, which makes me uncomfortable. Over all,  it looks classy"
4.0,"I prefer either right or left circular polarized lenses, but these work well"
4.0,The bracelet came in a plastic pouch not black velvet pouch as described in item specification. Buy Look nice
4.0,"This suit was as expected for the price. I like that the top covers well. I ordered a larger size based on other reviews. The colors are vibrant. The shelf bra is not at all supportive. Other than that, I'm happy with it."
4.0,Acceptable quality
4.0,Slightly thin; however they look cute & serves its great purpose
4.0,"OK, I'm having a VERY hard time believing that these are not the exact same as the Stoic Merino line that has been discontinued by Backcountry dot com. I had contacted them to see if they were ever going to carry that line again and the associate said no, but that they'd come out with a new line of gear clothing with a similar name to the Ridge Merino, it was Ridge something or other. He said that new line wasn't merino though, so I just started looking elsewhere for merino boyshorts. I stumbled upon these and my pair just arrived. I compared them side by side with my Stoic boyshorts, and they are IDENTICAL. Down to the stitching, the width of the waistband, the side seams and crotch seams, the length of the legs and the height of the waist.<br /><br />I mean IDENTICAL.<br /><br />Even the main complaint in the reviews being that the major bother is that the waist elastic twists, which is exactly the same as with the Stoics. The only difference is that based on the sizing chart I ordered the size small in these, whereas in the Stoics I would order medium. I put my new smalls up to my Stoic merino Mediums, and held them up, and there really is absolutely not one thing that distinguishes them from one another.<br /><br />So, of course I have no idea if I'm right or wrong, but if you loved Stoic boyshorts and you're looking to replace them, then these very possibly could be your perfect replacement. Just know that it looks like they're sized larger, because usually I would wear Medium in undies (125 pounds, 5'5&#34; but with very curvy hips much larger than waist and pretty small thighs) and in this brand the S fits perfect.<br /><br />I'm going to just go ahead and do what I always meant to do with my Stoics, which is to just put little hand stitches in a few locations of the elastic waist right when they arrive, so that they never get the opportunity to twist. In underwear this expensive, we shouldn't have to do this, but so be it, it is what it is.  Because of this problem with the elastic, I'm taking off a star, but otherwise I'm rating these exactly as I would the Stoics, and assuming they're going to fit, wear, and feel exactly the same. If this changes I'll come back and change my review, but for now I'm saying these are the most insanely comfortable boyshort undies i can imagine wearing. Not scratchy at all, they feel like a soft cloud hugging your bum when you hike, they're toasty in cold weather and breathable in hot. I love riding my bike to work in these esp if I have a skirt on, because if the skirt rides up no biggie, just looks like I have exercise shorts on. But they wick fabulously, and hold up to many days backpacking without getting The Stinkies.<br /><br />They are somewhat thick so expecting to hand wash and dry overnight is not reasonable, like it would be with synthetic wicking undies. So if you need to handwash overnight, bring two pair so you always have one dry."
4.0,A little bigger then expected but it‚Äôs still kinda cute ig
4.0,The bust area doesn't fit just right on me but I'll make it work. Its such a cute bathing suit. I'll still wear it. I kinda want to get another color. I bought the purple one.
4.0,"Fun pajama‚Äôs, but look like a boy‚Äôs size. Way too small for a man."
4.0,"Lovely piece.  I wear mostly silver jewelry but have recently began wearing rose colored jewelry too.  I love this ring because I can wear it with either one. The picture doesn't do it justice.  It looks much more elegant and sparkly in person.  I only gave this 4 stars because the rose colored part inside the band doesn't appear to the best quality, but I could be very wrong about that.  The low price makes me a bit suspicious too about the quality, but at this price even if it's a piece to wear for fun for a while it would still be worth it.  I have only had it a couple of day, but I am really hoping it holds up to time and wear."
4.0,Too close cut for me. But beautiful. had to return it.
4.0,They are a little small for my larger hands.
4.0,Lost a bet and had to wear a Seattle football shirt. Not my proudest moment. But the shirt is comfy and fits well. I‚Äôll wear it to bed now though. Not in public.
4.0,I loved it! It is perfectly fine. Used it for couple of years and still works fine
4.0,"I personally received the exact ties shown in the image, a pink white striped & a dark navy blue w/ pink ribbons.  These are good ties.  The quality is heavy enough to not worry about tearing & the length was good.  The designs left me with very little re-wearing ability, but at least the ties are well made.  At this price, I think these would be a good gift for someone that wears ties daily.  This would give them an affordable way to bulk up their rotation, but you could get 2 ties you don't like - so it's a minor drawback."
4.0,I really like how it looks on my hand
4.0,I modified the filter by taping a piece of florist wire to upper edge so I could conform it to the bridge of my nose . It now stays in place and helps keep the gaiter from sliding down. I also used double sided tape to attach the filter to the Insert pocket. Now the filter doesn‚Äôt slide out of the pocket in the gaiter.
4.0,Just arrived and is beautifull .. ideal weight ... not too thin not so thick .. same colour as shown in picture.. i ll def buy more if it stays this good even after use
4.0,"I really do like this dress. It's very summery. I wish the waistline was just a little lower, though, because it's almost a-line on me. Maybe that's because I'm well endowed up top, I don't know. Anyway, I added a wide brown belt to it and a cardigan and it was cute."
4.0,"Very nice quality, I should have ordered the size up. But that was comeplety my fault"
4.0,It was a gift. She seemed thrilled.
4.0,I like it very much.  very pretty.  I usually wear a 36D and that's what I ordered.  I am on the last hook rather than the first hook.
4.0,Really nice  looks just like the picture. Cut big
4.0,"Very soft, nice fabric!"
4.0,Lay flat across your face.
4.0,doses as it should
4.0,"I ordered the small.<br />Very comfortable! It fits a bit strange on my hips. The leg length is a bit awkward on me. I am 5'2"" and 125 lbs. And chest is a 32 D. I have slightly slender shoulders which causes the shoulders of the jumpsuit to sit pretty loose on me. I would prefer if the shoulders were a bit more fitted and the hips be a bit more tailored since it seems to pull off on my hips, it seems to be seen with very straight leg holes. However, if I tie up the legs with pony tails to make them more like shorts it solves the strange hip area issue. Overall, this is my favorite jumpsuit I love that it has sleeves! Which is unbelievably hard to find a good jumpsuit with sleeves! Just a few things to note:<br /><br />1. the leg length is odd for a person of my height, but can be adjusted by tying up the legs with a ponytail until you are able to alter it properly<br /><br />2. The shoulders are a bit wide for my size making the neckline a bit loose and wide, which is workae: be sure to have an undershirt with this if you are more slender in the shoulders!<br /><br />3. The pull on the hips is quite strange when the pant legs are left unaltered, when I tie the legs up with rubber bands to make them a shorter length it helps with the strange tension on the hips and lower stomach.<br /><br />Fabric is very comfortable and pretty breathable, however when In Direct sun the fabric starts to feel a tad too thick.<br /><br />It is not see-through at all, however due to the fabric anything that is layered underneath will make lines (ie pantylines, undershirt lines, bra lines etc)<br /><br />If u found this helpful please let me know by pressing the helpful button! :) I like to know who I have been able to help!"
4.0,"If you are any shorter than 5‚Äô4, do not bother buying this. The small was so long that I had the dress tailored. I guess it‚Äôs a good dress for taller ladies."
4.0,"The color is a little lighter then what it shows in the picture, but other then that I love it, its warm and very comfortable!!"
4.0,Very pretty and comfortable fabric. Sizing is slightly smaller than expected for pajamas.
4.0,Beautiful dress but it was kinda small. It also arrived late even though I selected 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime :(
4.0,"So ok this is a surprise for myself. Bought these expecting to hate it. It is really comfortable. Love the material. I bought a medium but I think I could wear a small. However, I like the loose look so I can wear a more form fitting top. So I‚Äôm keeping my medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 150lbs athletic build. There is elastic in the waistband and those are faux buttons. I thought those were real buttons so it is a slip-on and that‚Äôs why I docked one star. Oh and it‚Äôs NOT see through ladies!"
4.0,"Nice slippers, not shoes.  Very cozy and warm.  Light weight and the inside is nice, but the 4 stars is because the inside pile bunches up underneath the toes.  I have to push it down a lot.  Had a pair like that and ended up cutting it out.  So I spread it out more often so it doesn't pull the bottom up and apart.  But for the price, not a biggie."
4.0,"Absolutely my favorite. This shirt is so soft and comfy I wish I had it in multiple colors. My only complaint, I wish it was a bit longer."
4.0,Love this shirt. Light material and perfect for those cool mornings going into warmer days...you know Louisiana Fall!!ü§£
4.0,"This is the cutest suit. However, it accentuates my muffin top and back fat. If I were very slim, It would be in my drawer. Nicely made. Great fabric."
4.0,Very cute but changed color after few weeks of wearing
4.0,"It fits just fine, but is shorter than I have expected. Not quite a crop top, but right at the top of my jeans. You can‚Äôt tell from the photos, as it‚Äôs tucked into the model‚Äôs jeans, but realistically, I don‚Äôt think you could comfortable tuck the shirt into a pair of pants. Overall, it‚Äôs nice though and I like wearing it."
4.0,"This product seems to be as advertised. It is soft, and has a good feel to it. It isn't flimsy. I haven't actually used it yet - I bought it for a trip I am taking in several weeks. But so far, so good. It arrived quickly, and looks great!"
4.0,Quality to price ratio<br />Used them for sunglasses
4.0,otherwise it is lovely
4.0,This rompers is so comfy and I love it.. It fits me perfect but there are some funny looking spots just because I am not skinny or flat tummies. I just adjust the mid section of the outfit and it was good to go. The price was a steal of a deal and id reccomend this to anyone.
4.0,Very nice !  Fits well and brilliant shine<br />Not sure what the black facet spinner is made of but very nice shine
4.0,Too light and comfortable I Really like it and I Think I will order more colors
4.0,"Great quality...almost perfect with a separated area for change, credit cards, et al. I do wish it had an outside open sleeve for a quick stash of credit cards in a hurry, but that's a personal preference and hard to find."
4.0,"Lenses look and fit awesome. My only complaint is that the lenses change color to purple and blue depending on the angle. Its not really a problem, i would have just prefered all green."
4.0,"I like this necklace. The chain is sturdy and pretty, and the stone is nice. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it was a bit overpriced."
4.0,"This is a cute little bootie. They look great with a mini skirt or bootcut jeans.  The heel height is perfect, and they are surprisingly comfortable.  The only problem is that the material does not breath, so my feet get a bit sweaty.  This typically does not happen to me."
4.0,I ordered 2 of them.  I liked the first so much I got another one to keep for<br />If I wear out the first one.
4.0,I have wore this dress a few times and it‚Äôs beautiful but it‚Äôs short and showy.
4.0,Super cute but the size I ordered for my daughter was too small for her and it's just one of those situations where you kind of wished you got it at a store.
4.0,I got an xlarge. That is my usual size. This was really small. More like a medium. The reason I gave it a four star is because other than the sizing issue this shirt is well made and cute. The material also light weight and feels comfy to the touch. Wish it had of fit. Would of loved to of worn it. The coloring was really cute also. If it came in larger sizes I would of reordered up two sizes. I like mine loose fitting .. I actually could barely get this one over my head so could not even say it fit tight. It just did not fit
4.0,Beautiful but tight fit.
4.0,This is a very light dress. The sleeves were not too tight and the slip under dress helped not make it see through. Not the greatest material but it looks great!
4.0,Hard to tell grand son only 2 can't tell if too tight . He hasn't said they hurt so we're thinking they are ok
4.0,The sleeves seemed really long. But it was soft and cute! Just as pictured
4.0,"i am 5' 6"", 180 lbs with a hour glass figure, larger back side. I bought a size large according to the suggested size chart. It fits but its snug, hugs every single curve I have. But that is not what I wanted. I was looking for a fitted formal cocktail dress to wear to a wedding that would flatter my curvy figure, not make my booty be like POW, right in your face. This would be PERFECT for a night on the town with your friends or a sexy date night with my hubby. I think if I ordered a size up from suggestion, this wouldn't be as much of an issue."
4.0,Love these. They are very beautiful!
4.0,Great hat. My son bought these to go with various outfits. He likes that they're plain without emblems.
4.0,"This mask is really fun, it gets a lot of attention from everybody. Build quality is decent, picture quality is not the best, when you upload a custom image you can never tell what it is on the mask. The app has some decent options though, just not a ton"
4.0,Buying another one; fits well; no slip; not too big and floppy
4.0,"Been using it for a month for school and works pretty good. My only 2 complaints are that there is no top handle (for carrying like a briefcase) and that there is no pad on the shoulder strap. Sometimes depending how you wear it, the adjusting buckle digs on your shoulder (hence the 4 stars). I ended up buying a seatbelt pad at Autozone and problem solved."
4.0,"took in trip to NYC and was VERY light weight /long enough strap to place over shoulder and head--great for lots of foot travel in the big apple. Only negative was NO slots for a couple of cards ie credit, drivers license, medical card."
4.0,Decent strap. Works well with Gear S2
4.0,"Like this cut, and bought it in 2 colors. Very loose look, but that is what I wanted. Color is vivid."
4.0,I like the sweater ordered the red which happens to not be red at all but a coral color. I wanted to wear for Christmas but didn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not red.
4.0,Top of socks need a little stretch in them. But other wise ok. Don't put these socks in the dryer.
4.0,The shoes are for my son at college. He uses them in the dorm shower. He has been very happy with them.
4.0,List sparkle after a week or so.
4.0,"This case and the design of the watch are very attractive.  Apparently there also some eye appeal for the steam punk bunch, my 13 year old has commented on the watch and I suspect he has his eye on it.  I really like the front case design, in that the &#34;peephole&#34; allows you to check the time without popping open the cover.<br /><br />This is not to be mistaken for a fine time piece however,  The stem does not have very fine tolerance, and I question how accurate the watch is and how it will perform over the long haul.  Not a family heirloom, but not a bad little item either.<br /><br />This review is based on a complimentary review sample provided by the seller in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
4.0,"Worn 'em twice already. Real nice green color and mirror look.<br />Sturdy clip, 10 bucks and polarized.<br />I hope they hold up, but very good quality for the price."
4.0,Very cozy in winter months
4.0,I get annoyed when tank tops are see through. This one is not see through and the material is nice. The printing seems like it will hold up well enough and look even better as it ages.<br /><br />I expected it to fit loose and it‚Äôs more form fitting so possibly order up if you want it baggy.
4.0,"Overall works well. I use this for travelling internationally several times a year, and after 2 years it's starting to come apart. It seems some seams are just glued together, and that's where the weakness is. It's still usable, and still a staple for my travel, but I'm not sure it would hold up well to my everyday use."
4.0,Roomy and the colour is beautiful. Many pockets and carrying options.  I carry heavy stuff however and it seems the straps might eventally give way under the pressure but so far so good.
4.0,"I wanted a small hoop, but these were TINY. They worked great with an easy fasten, but were too small for my piercing."
4.0,I bought these socks for my husband.  The first pair was really tight around the top of the calf.  A size large fixed the problem.  The socks seem to be of good quality.  The only con was the price.  They are a little more expensive then other styles.
4.0,Very nice dress. Did a little alteration to the dress.
4.0,I love this shirt!!  Runs slightly small.
4.0,"I received this harness and I was impressed with the extra bolt and tether straps. However, I was expecting the straps to be more robust and the shoulder harness to be more padded.  I 'm giving a 3 -star for now because I haven't yet put this harness to the test. So I'll return within a week to update after my job on weekend."
4.0,I like the way they fit. They do what they are supposed to. I have night blindness and these really help.
4.0,"only rated 4 star because it only comes with 1 filter, it claims to last moreqthen 3 months, but if you wear this for work, which is 40hrs a week, the filter aint going to last 3 months, i purchased this like 2 weeks ago, so will update about the filter in a month and see how it is. i work at a grocery store, so i needed a face mask thats comfortable and doesnt hurt my ears in the back like the disposable face masks, or other face mask that just covers the mouth and nose with ear loops.<br /><br />this face mask/neck gaiter doesn't hurt my ears in the back, i can wear this all day.<br /> only problem i have is, i wish it comes with a few more filters, because i dont even know where to buy replacement filters for this neck gaiter"
4.0,"Like FP usually is, low cut and boxy.  Not long.  Glad I got a sale"
4.0,What I irdeted
4.0,Super cute and comfortable dress! I got a lot of compliments in it. The printed fabric has started piling in the front a little the first time I wore it though. Hopefully it won‚Äôt get worse after washing.
4.0,They slide down your nose it would<br />Be helpful to add non slip stoppers
4.0,"Sizing runs big, nice quality.  Everything I‚Äôve ordered from this designer has held up really well"
4.0,"These glasses came well packaged with unexpected extras. The frames are light weight without being flimsy, the lenses are dark but not too dark. The polarization is very good and one of the extras provided is a picture where you can test the polarization like they have on store displays.<br />A soft case was included, but there was also a nice leather-like case included. A lens cleaning cloth was added, but there was also an eyeglass screwdriver with both a flat and phillips tips.<br />I have a pretty big head and these glasses fit quite well and they look pretty stylish."
4.0,I liked but it said it ran big but it was the same size as the regular one so if you have a big wrist I would look for an extra extra large size. Love the product though.
4.0,Looks nice but alittle cheaper look than I thought.
4.0,"The fit was what I thought- since one size fits all, I didn't have too big expectations. The legs are a little long on me, and the leggings are a little loose, but not bad. I'm a size 6-8P, in case that helps."
4.0,Wore to EDC this yr got a lot of compliments. The feathers do get tangled to the hair a bit especially if your dancing. The earrings are amazing!
4.0,"I thought they felt really good and moved well with me. The wife said they look like skinny jeans mixed with jeggings. I was a bit confused then she explained that I shouldn't wear them out any where but around the house would be ok . I like them though. They do hug my butt. Guess for a ""thin"" guy these would be great. Cuff at the ankle."
4.0,"So, I did deduct one star because 11 of the pieces are gorgeous, beautiful and have good quality enameling/rhinestones; but the 12th one was a piece of crud. (The one with the 2 candy canes.) No rhinestones, enamel was very sloppy and missing in a few places, and the pin back was missing. Very odd--almost looked like it was a totally different brand/manufacture than the rest. (?)"
4.0,Would give five stars but the bra sizing is wayyyyy off. Great bra just need to correct the sizing
4.0,I'm 6'4&#34; sleeves are long enough. Robe is made well and comfortable. Feels great on cold winter nights
4.0,I really like this shirt - I would order a size a bigger than usual though. It is 2 pieces- a bralette with the sparkles and then the T that goes over it.
4.0,"Fit well, arrived fast, good quality"
4.0,"Not what I expected. It says ""assorted one pack"" I took that to mean that there were several in a pack. It is only one. You do not get to choose the color. I wanted to use these in gift bags but for almost $14 for each it's way pricey. The item is cute but bigger then expected which is my fault for not looking at how big they are. Overall it is cute. I would not have chosen these colors but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è."
4.0,"I go camping a lot in temperatures ranging from 0 - 90F. These were great for me down to 25 degrees before I need gloves. I can easily slip my gloves over these for even extra warmth, As with all wool products they are slightly itchy but for outdoors you don't want to use cotton. Wool maintains its insulative properties even when wet and wicks away moisture from your body cotton does not. Contrary to a couple reviews belown mine these are warm..."
4.0,"I really like that these are trying something different from the regular rubber tips. I like these because they feel good and the colors are cool and might help you find your glasses easier. However, they are a pain to get on. The opening is burned to prevent fraying, but, this makes the opening inflexible and fery difficult to open and get your temples inserted. But, stay patient and keep working them and you'll eventually get em on"
4.0,"I love the skirt but I order an XL, it's way to big so IBM returning it and purchasing a smaller size."
4.0,"Everyone should try ""custom t-shirt"" its amazing you can send them a picture and get the results you do.<br />This is the first long sleeve one I have ordered, I wish the sleeves were a little bit longer but I am happy with the results!!!"
4.0,I expected a little more large earrings they are too too small but they are cute anyway I can used it.
4.0,Does run big!!! Be aware. Not bad when they have shoes on...but the fingers are still big and are constantly trying to keep their fingers in order to grab things...and the neck piece does not tuck in. Other than that...super cute costume. Everyone loved!!!!
4.0,Just as Described.
4.0,It was purchased as an inexpensive and fun piece of jewelry that could be slipped over your head.  It is definitely that.  It's also heavy and seems solidly made.
4.0,"These literally fit like a glove. I love the cut and style, but worry about the slightest bit of shrinkage."
4.0,"cool i love this peice really beautiful,fits perfect"
4.0,"This kaftan is not horrible! Lol. When I first opened the package, I saw it was that thin, shiny polyester material and thought it was a ""no"" but tried it on, and was pleasantly surprised. Kinda cute. Comfy. Up close it looks a tiny bit cheap, but still overall looks nice...great colors.<br /> I'm 5' 3"" and a size 14 and this was pretty big!  My only real complaint is that it was very clingy...keep a little can of static guard handy!"
4.0,"Very good, I like it very much"
4.0,Comfortable and stylish. Love the colors and pattern. Paired it with some ankle boots and hit the town! Great purchase.
4.0,"I thought these panties would have move spandex.  They aren't exactly what I wanted, but they are well made and will work"
4.0,Love this dress its very beautiful!!!
4.0,"Bought these for our daughter who usually wears a small.  We ordered a med and they fit.  Pls note that the shorts are very short/form fitting.  The top fits more modestly.  They are cute, don't seem to be see thru, just short shorts."
4.0,The night shirt runs very large.But I didn't return as I just love so much.
4.0,Love the product!!! But the wrong size was sent.
4.0,"I live in the North West and the temperatures here can be quite harsh, especially in the late winter. Last year's winter was really cold and my toes were always like ice. I looked for a decent pair of boots and found these. This turned out to be one of the best purchases I have made as these are the warmest pair of boots I have ever owned. I also have a pair of 120 dollar Carhartts which are also equally awesome but do not hold a candle to these in terms of keeping my feet warm. Someone here posted a review saying to get a size or half size smaller than you normally wear and they were right. I am normally a 9.5 and I got a pair in size 9 and they turned out to be just right when I have wool socks on. Without the socks they were really big. Size 9 of these is like size 10 maybe 10.5 in normal size. Boots are excellently made and I have already stepped into rain puddles to test them out and YES they are waterproof.  My only complaint about these boots is that the laces are mediocre. I have a suspicion that the original laces were replaced. The ones that came with these boots are &#34;thin noodle&#34; waxed laces, clearly not boot laces. The boot ears are  designed for the thick mil style kevlar or bonded material boot laces. Just look at the holes. I ended up buying a pair of real boot laces instead of these POS shoelaces. Other then that, great boots and great value."
4.0,"I like this earings but the reason a put 4 stars is cuz they are smaller than i expected to be ,and when i try to wear it for the first time it wasn't closing and the other was hard ,i been using them for like a week and the color seems the same ,I recomended also for children"
4.0,"Gloves for housework are very nice. Ordered 8/3/19 and received 8/15/19.  They shipped from China and it took a litter to get, as expected.  I like that long cuff."
4.0,love this but need to be careful - makes a mess it the whole bar comes off when you are putting jewelry on or off and that can happen easily.
4.0,"I should add that for me, it was somewhat small, but for a person with a normal build, it would fit as expected.  I'm short and stocky, so it fit like a compression shirt"
4.0,"A lot of good features and appearance is superior to other orthotic shoes I looked at.  Just not for me ,,, I recently had foot surgery so I want to be fair."
4.0,"This watch is described as being a man's watch. It's more unisex. I am a female and I purchased it for myself. I like the 2 tone color with the blue case face. Very attractive. It looks far more expensive than just $7.00. Had to get it resized, though. Since it is an expandable band, I had to take it to a jeweler. That added $5.00 to the cost. Worth it.  I gave it 4 stars because the watch is not 37mm as described. It is more like 30mm. That's fine for me, but if you want  a watch that is actually 37mm, you may be very disappointed if you buy this one. I purchased the silver tone one, as well. Why not? 7 bucks!"
4.0,This is super adorable and well made. It can definitely uphold through multiple wears. I wish I had gotten it a little bigger because the sizes run about 2 sizes too small in the shirt and 1 size too small in the shorts. The shirt is not going to fit much longer but hopefully she can wear the shorts a few more times.
4.0,"This is a super adorable suit! I read through all of the reviews saying it runs big and to size down, normally when I see that I listen and then it gets here and I get stuck in a bikini top damn near needing to be cut out of the bloody thing! So this time I ordered my regular size, XL. Since the top & bottom came together I knew there'd be no way both parts would fit me, and I was right. I definitely could have gone down to a large, I wear  40DD. Don't get me wrong - the top is wearable and still cute (after I pulled the wrinkled ass cup whatsits out), but I feel like it would have more support a size down. The bottoms on the other hand üòÇ, I could realistically go down to an M... I usually wear a 12-14 in pants. These look like I've filled my diaper üò≥ I have tons of bottoms, since that's not usually where I have issues with fit, so I'm ok with finally finding a top that fits!"
4.0,"Logo could have been tilted as the original is.. But the ring is solid, the hidden leaf logo hasn't faded. The ring. Has seen some abuse though. Scratches, scrapes and imperfections are abundant but adds character to this colour I think."
4.0,These jogging pants are well made the pants are thick and keep me warm during my morning run. The pants are stylish they don't feel baggy. The pants taper at the ankle which are very much in style right now. Front of the pants are textured while the back is smooth in texture. Packaging was great pants came in a vacuum sealed bag so pants arrived dry and damaged free. Pants run one size smaller I usually wear a size large but after reading another review I decided to go a size up (XL) and I am happy I did. Refer to sizing chart before ordering.
4.0,"Everywhere but the pouch fits. It's an odd set up. The flap is supposed to cover your front, but it's not exactly enough to cover."
4.0,I purchased this dress in white for a Marilyn Monroe costume. It fit amazing! I am 5‚Äô1 and 180 lbs and got a L and it fit perfectly. If you have a large bust it is a bit cleavage-y. The top is double lined so you can get away with not wearing a bra but the skirt part is only single lined so it is a little see through
4.0,Very comfortable and launder well. Delivery was on time
4.0,It fits like the original
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù ish and the dress doesn‚Äôt quite skim the floor like I‚Äôd like. Wouldn‚Äôt be able to wear heels. 280#, ordered the 2x and there‚Äôs plenty of room. Dress is heavy and probably will be more spring/fall than summer wear depending on weather. Slightly see-through top, but not too bad. Very cute and worth the money."
4.0,The fit was extremely comfortable.
4.0,Fits as it should. Good soft quality. Looks just like picture.
4.0,"The only reason I rated this 4 rather than 5 is that I had to seam-rip the inside pocket to allow my iPhone 6+ to fit. Other than that, it is a BEAUTIFUL wallet in a gorgeous olive/gold. I am complimented regularly on this fantastic and functional wallet."
4.0,"Love, Love, Love... Great looking. Professional packaging. Fast delivery."
4.0,If you like this and they have your size and color choice then you need to buy it immediately.  Trust me all the colors sell fast and when you come back to buy another one it will be gone...  Great length and love wearing them w Jeans or leggings.
4.0,"The design is really fashion, special and beautiful. But the bag itself is a little bit too heavy"
4.0,"LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è These!! I bought these ~2 sizes up (daughter is a 12 and I bought a 2), so they fit great; however, they clearly run small, I went up so much after reading the other reviews (so thank you!)!<br /><br />My daughter has non-stop (inside) since she opened them! They are adorable!<br /><br />That being said, ‚Äúquality‚Äù or ‚Äúwell-made‚Äù they are NOT! One of the pink gems already came off (she‚Äôs had them less than a week), I‚Äôve been cutting off the loose strings, etc. If these make it through the winter (in FL), I‚Äôll be very happy! Even if they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre worth it!<br /><br />You‚Äôre getting what you pay for: An adorable, poorly-made bootie for indoors. I wish these would sizes more accurately and that they made them for adults!<br /><br />I‚Äôd buy these again in a heartbeat and if I have to buy 2 pairs to make it through the winter, I still think it‚Äôs worth it (but they‚Äôre out of ‚Äúher size‚Äù)."
4.0,I really like the scrunched look ü•∞ but order a size up if you don‚Äôt like have a tight band around your wrist other that that it‚Äôs very nice
4.0,"Rather low cut, so if you are a little fuller uptop, you might need to wear something underneath it. But still really cute."
4.0,My grandson LOVES them! The material was different than what I expected.  A lighter material... but appears to be well made.
4.0,"Kind of a weird material, not soft, but great otherwise"
4.0,"Very soft Sherpa, fleece inside and out (in fact it‚Äôs so soft, my dog often tries to sleep on It! It is super warm. I live in NYC and wore this outside instead of a coat in November in 40 degree temps and it kept me very warm with just a t-shirt underneath. As for sizing, this runs a little big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 145lbs with a larger chest. I usually am a medium but ordered a small and it‚Äôs pretty big in the body (if they had an XS I would have ordered). When I pull it down it covers my butt, but also stays up at the waist which is how I usually wear.<br />It doesn‚Äôt shed. I washed on a gentle cycle and line dried. It didn‚Äôt shrink, didn‚Äôt fall apart or stretch out from what I can tell."
4.0,"Love it, fits nice on my daughter"
4.0,Adorable top! Super affordable and I get a lot of compliments on it. My only complaint is that the neckline is extremely high and tighter around my neck! I would definitely consider buying other colors.
4.0,"Great and sexy, but too small.  Move up a size for sure"
4.0,Para navidad
4.0,"Love it, but should have ordered a larger size.  Love the pockets, great color too!!"
4.0,Truity mens workout shorts. These run a little large but they have a drawstring so stay in place while working out or running. The color is agreat vibrant blue and the material is on the thinner lightweight side. Very breathable and great for summertime weather workouts. These dry quickly and areco mlm comftorable to wear. Decent running shorts for men.
4.0,I love this necklace....and it look exactly like the picture..I can't wait to wear it out. I very please with this purchase and it came earlier than expected too...overall I'm happy
4.0,"I liked this bracelet so much I wanted my son to have one.  My fault, I forgot my son has skinny wrists.  Don‚Äôt even know if they make this smaller, but I should‚Äôve checked.  Otherwise I love it."
4.0,"The details are not as finely outlined as shown in the picture, and the posts bend pretty easily (don't fall asleep in them!). Other than that, cute and I still love them."
4.0,"Haven't worn them yet, but I'm happy with my purchase"
4.0,Love the top I'm a large so I got a large. Just a little too big
4.0,Love the material. Silky smooth. Love the brown clover pattern.
4.0,Larger than expected. Some came broken (dolphin tales) but most were great! My girls LOVED them!
4.0,"I purchased this dress last minute after not being able to find a dress I liked for my fathers funeral. I‚Äôm so grateful that I found it, it was perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 175 lbs and i ordered a large. My only complaint was that it was a little too big, but not enough for it to matter."
4.0,Nice necklace and good price.
4.0,This is the cutest little halter. There is absolutely no support for us larger boobie women but it pairs very nicely with a jacket or sweater. I liked it a lot and my date found it very sexy!! Get this little number and show off just don‚Äôt be flopping around a lot and you‚Äôre good!
4.0,"It was a bit big on me, the crutch was lower than expected but overall it was good."
4.0,"I tried it on when it arrived and it appears it will fit.  I'm hoping it will block the sun, but since it's winter, I can't say for sure.  Seems like a nice product though and I'm excited to have it."
4.0,"Very warm, a little heavier than expected, but fit properly.  Good for use while running on motorized vehicle, a little too warm for walking in 20¬∞ weather."
4.0,Great fit! The material is nice not costume-y at all. My one issue is the zipper seams came undone and I had to hand stitch them.  Other than that no issues great length. It looks good with our without a petticoat
4.0,Nice jacket pretty but definitely not worth $85 a lil over priced!<br />Very warm!
4.0,Good watch. So-so band and terrible boxing ( leather stain bleeds onto the white watch pillow) not a good look as a gift presentation wise
4.0,"Seriously the pants are super comfortable and cute and the band is super stretchy and I could fit my iPhone 6 Plus in the pocket, now the down side.<br />The fabric is delicate, it's strong but the seam in the front split within a month of owning, be careful with them, wash them separate, hang dry, etc.<br />if you follow that you'll love these pants FOREVER. My other pair I got are doing great!"
4.0,"Howdy I‚Äôm 14 and female so my fingers r kinda on the smaller side, most of them r adjustable except about three of them. They r made pretty good quality and all have unique designs kinda a bummer the big dragon one wasn‚Äôt adjustable though, I painted the inside of my rings with clear nail polish so they don‚Äôt turn my fingers green. Also some of the thicker ones r a bit difficult to resize other then that, would recommend they r very pretty :)"
4.0,"The pants began to come loose with keys and change in pocket. I would recommend washing them in a laundry bag or pillow case to protect from tearing at the seam. I do not think I would purchase them for outside wear, but maybe for sleepwear."
4.0,"These arrive looking faded, not as the bright item seen online.  Still, they are comfortable and will be worn under pants, so it is not like anyone will be judging my poor fashion sense whilst I am out in public. [smile]"
4.0,I love this dress!  I purchased it for a special occasion and it is very pretty and quite flattering.  It is nice for the price but face it this is an inexpensive item so it may not be exceptionally made but it is everything I wanted and at a great price.  Now to find shoes :)
4.0,Got these for my 6 year old who is between size 6/6x and 7 and they fit kind of snug. The way the straps secure is kind of weird because it leaves the extra bit visible. Also the pockets have started to unravel. Overall they were find for her halloween costume but she won't be able to get much more out of them.
4.0,I got this housecoat was for my grandmother. She's 92 and walks hunched over. She's about 5'3&#34;. This duster had to be hemmed quite a lot so she wouldn't trip on it.  No complaints other than that.
4.0,A bit thicker than I was expecting. Great quality for lounging hut little heavy for workouts.
4.0,To work as said and haven't slipped off head.
4.0,Kept mask off face. Made it easier to understand conversation.
4.0,"Like the golden floss dancer. Not sure how resistant the golden partern will be at washing... time will tell.<br />Cotton fabrics, that I like :)<br />However quite light cotton... more for spring /fall than winter."
4.0,Havent really had an opportunity to wear it yet but it's cute.
4.0,Size seems to be a bit off. Shipping is super fast.
4.0,"It ran a little smaller than expected, but it is a very nice item.  I would buy it again"
4.0,"Followed other reviews as not to damage them, they certainly are very easy to break while attaching. However, they seem to be sturdy enough while installed. I am using these on boots and kinda wish there was more than 3 per show/boot, but it works fine."
4.0,I really like this robe.  It's well-made and very comfortable.  The only drawback is that that it runs small.  I'm an L and it fits me comfortably.  It would never fit a size larger than that.
4.0,"Great dress for the price! Good quality, but too form-fitting for work in my opinion. Does kind of cling a bit around the midsection.  I bought the medium and I'm 34C-28-38, 5'5."
4.0,"These are decent glasses-solid construction, light plastic."
4.0,material seemed a little thin- like it may not hold up well to washing
4.0,"Pretty, nicely made."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:10e7755707b52f612149a6ccf03f9619]] This shirt has the feel of a light soccer jersey. I normally wear a medium size shirt and this medium fit me just as expected.<br /><br />It has a kind of retro sporty style. It feels lightweight and breathable. I think it's a little over priced to be honest. You can find shirts like this in the US at retailers for a lower cost.
4.0,"These are cute in a nostalgic kinda way. These are like windbreaker material. They have no give to them. I got a small and I‚Äôm 135 and 5,1‚Äù and they fit me good. A tad snug. The pockets on the lower sides are not real pockets. They are comfortable but make a a bit of noise when you walk lol üòÜ"
4.0,"Pretty decent little watch. I think it looks quite good and the black on black style is very popular now. There are a couple things I don't like that warranted a drop of one star, but they may not bother you, so read on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- nice looking, trendy black on black<br />- white hour markers look nice in contrast to black face<br />- half textured, half smooth face is interesting and unique<br />- good size case that looks nice on most people (Men & Women)<br />- low profile fits nicely under sleeves<br />- classy domed crystal<br /><br />Cons:<br />- band is and looks cheap. This could be improved without requiring an expensive upgrade. However, no one will look closely enough to have any complaints about your watch band, so this only matters if you're particular about how it looks to you. I will say this it is comfortable.<br />- the hands are hard to read most of the time, but nearly invisible in dim settings. This is because the hour and minute hands are black with a thin stripe of color through the middle. The hour hand is black with a white stripe, which isn't too bad, but the minute hand is black with a dark red stripe and is invisible most of the time unless the watch is in direct light. By contrast, the second hand is bright white and really pops against the black background. I'd like to see Voeons use a bright orange or yellow on the minute hand and consider making the hour hand a solid color too. However, if you like this watch for it's looks and don't plan to rely on it for time-telling, none of the above will matter to you.<br />- The buckle is fine, but it's silver in color and would look a lot better in black to match the rest of the watch.<br />- mine has a small fleck of something gold in color stuck in the watch. It moves around and right now is stuck against the crystal. It's not a huge deal other than it signals a lack of quality control in the manufacture process.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, casual watch that is on point with a modern style trend. It's a good choice and looks nice. However, I think it's overpriced for what it is. I'd say it's worth about $60.<br /><br />I received a discounted item for testing. My opinions are all my own.<br /><br />Hopefully this review has been helpful to you."
4.0,I bought these sneakers for my 11 year old.He plays basketball at school and he want it to have good shoes for that.He is happy with sneakers and I'm happy too
4.0,The are really good bike shorts.
4.0,"The glasses are great and comfortable. Very clear lenses, and really nice picture. The glasses seem to be a little weak as far as the frame goes, but overall very happy. The seller is A+ in my book. Very quick and very hastle free."
4.0,Smaller stone than expected but sweet and cute
4.0,"I bought these for my elderly friend who still has horses and does a lot of barn work. Although the barn isn't heated, I think these will be warm enough and not too bulky for shoveling stalls and feeding and watering her animals.  And the price was excellent."
4.0,"very pretty and very different, I have received compliments"
4.0,"As a product designer with some watch design experience, I know a little more than the average person when it comes to watches. I was surprised by the quality of this watch for the price I paid. I have a few other watches that cost a great deal more and this one is just under par with those. The case proportions are good overall, and the dial is as pictured. One caveat to that is that the 12, 6 and sewor logo are just a little shallower in height than the rest of the minute marks; my only real quip with the design. Looks a little strange. But hey, its only 20 bucks. The crystal has a nice slight bubble to it, but not too much. The inside layer of the strap MIGHT be genuine leather, but the outside is definitely a sort of PU and it looks and feels as such. The band is extremely stiff and needed a bit of flexing before I could even get around my wrist. Once it was on, it was pretty comfy, minus the small metal bit that connected the second retaining loop. It will occasionally rub against my wrist and pinch my skin a little if I don't have the strap tight enough.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. Pardon the pun, but time will tell if the quality is a good as I believe it be."
4.0,"Very good product, especially for the money. Clarity is very good. I was not expecting Oakleys or Ray Bans for $1.71, that would be HIGHLY unrealistic.  However, they do compare to sunglasses that I have bought over the years for $10 or so.  If someone had a business that they were going to sell them in I believe they would move at $10 and leave plenty of profit margin. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that they are budget sunglasses and not high end quality but well worth the money."
4.0,They looked great!  Wore them to an 80's event.
4.0,I bought these for My Wife and Daughter! And they love the ease in which you can remove key and add them back to the keychain. In the pass they have complained about how difficult it is to remove or add keys to their keychains and how often they break their nails! The Mehr Leather keychains are stylish in a minimal way!! I would recommend this product!!!
4.0,My daughter is a size 13 and these just fit her. I would size up.
4.0,"These pants fit a little snug, even for a slim fit, especially for a straight-leg pair of jeans. The patchwork is vibrant, hemmed well, and adds a layer of fabric, making them slightly warmer than typical jeans."
4.0,"It's a cute little bag! However, one of the straps broke off. I has to find a replacement."
4.0,"Very pretty dress. Color was beautiful.  Lightweight and comfortable. The top fit a little strange at first, but it settled nicely. I'm 5'4 and it was the perfect length with flats."
4.0,"So far it works very well! It was super easy to put in, my only fear is that the balls don't get tight enough to stay on well but no issues yet! It's cheap and cute, even though it's a little too long for my ear. Overall, I'd say worth a buy!<br />FYI the little dragonfly can be moved up and down the bar to make sure it sits how you want it to."
4.0,The tops are a little wide but still nice
4.0,"I was happy with the first set of these that I ordered a few months ago. But this time, the elastic waistband in the grey pair is really loose. It's almost as if the elastic is maybe old? Because it sounded like I ripped the waistband when I was trying them on."
4.0,it fit good and looks good on him so it was worth it to get it on line thank you
4.0,"Great for credit/debit cards or ID cards. It is too tight to hold paper business cards or even cash but for its simplicity and looks its great.<br />I would describe it more of a card holder than a wallet.<br /><br />Can have trouble slipping cards back in so youll have to put the card in between two cards already in the card holder, making OCD and organizing hard.<br /><br /> I have about 5 to 6 cards in it now and it works great. I use the finger slot to pop my  cards out and fan it like a hand of playing cards to locate the one I need and do the same to return it back to the wallet. Unfortunately the end cards are difficult to slide back and forth like mentioned above.<br /><br />Still a great sleek, durable, and beautiful card holder."
4.0,It was to big and couldn't return it.
4.0,"The pockets add volume to your hips, so if that is a self-conscious area I do NOT suggest this maxi.  Orange is as pictured, and it is very vibrant! I am 5'3 and this touches the floor for me.  Great casual maxi dress"
4.0,"The quality of these glasses is amazing. There is a thin plastic that is used for the lenses. However, they were a little to big for me. I normally like to wear fake glasses for my everyday look but these were to big for my face. Think Kim from Napoleon Dynomite meets Eurcle. If your going for a fun party/ Halloween nerd look these are for you!"
4.0,I like the quality and how smooth the silk is but I did notice a slight bump on top
4.0,"I received this bag as a congratulatory gift for starting a new job. I really like cross-body bags because I find them versatile and convenient (hands-free). I enjoy using it for work as it fits my laptop along with all of the other belongings I need to tote around on a day-to-day basis. The quality is actually very good for a hand-made bag, and the front pocket is useful for items that I need to be able to access quickly. There was a slight smell when it first arrived, but it went away after a few weeks of using the bag."
4.0,This was a comfortable fit when I go running.<br />I was given this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.
4.0,"Comfortable, stretchy, pockets only qualm is the sleeves are to short."
4.0,"I had surgery and needed underwear w/ some compression.  I LOVE these!  I feel like they run a tad small in the leg openings. other than that, I LOVE them!!  they hadn't faded from wash and haven't stretched out."
4.0,These are cute but a little bigger than all the other panties of the same size bought at retail stores. Still fit and cute designs though.
4.0,Would have like the straps to be longer and leather
4.0,"These are cute, fit my 6 month old a tad snug, but look great."
4.0,Love the earrings but wish that the backs were more secure. Had to use another set of backs on these.
4.0,"I ordered this coat for my daughter. She is a small/medium in almost everything so I ordered the medium. It was to small. Coat itself is great, but had to return for a bigger size. Other than that it is a nice winter coat. Seems warm and will be nice for the cold winters where we live."
4.0,"Nice tote, would have liked the inside flaps that help hold the scriptures in, but it was for my daughter and she is happy with it."
4.0,So far so good.  I use it daily in front of my food trailer.  It really keeps the sun off.
4.0,"These look nice in, and I think they're made out of a good quality metal as I have sensitive ears and have been wearing them for about a week now with no issues. My only complain is that one pair in particular was extremely hard to open and close, but I fixed it with a pair of wire cutters."
4.0,The only thing preventing a five star review is that they're not polarized.  Otherwise they fit great for someone with a smaller head.
4.0,Like the purse just wish straps were attached all the way to the top. Also alittle thicker
4.0,"the bracelet is beautiful, is handy,looks good in the hands of the girls.<br />the purchase is fast. must be careful not to leave the golden color of the charms. so I put 4 of qualification.<br />thanks"
4.0,The earrings are the perfect size for me. I‚Äôm a plus size woman and the size of the earrings are amazing. I love the fact that they are  very light in weight . But my concern is the clasp. It‚Äôs very flimsy. Otherwise it‚Äôs perfect!
4.0,"Cute summer dress; my hubby‚Äôs new favorite on me.  Fits as expected, order regular size."
4.0,"Sounds good, in the factory it's not too loud wish it had a little bit more volume."
4.0,Great match with the Purse I also purchased. A better discount should be applied when you are buying a matching $108.00 Purse at the Same Time
4.0,"This is my first time dealing with a sticky bra. I haven't actually worn it out yet, but the initial try on was great. I probably didn't place it exactly right, but it still worked fine. I was surprised to notice a little oomph in my chest when I saw it under clothes since it looked only like a cover and not a lifter as well. Plus, I could tell it was very sticky, and it didn't move. I only put 4 stars since I have not worn it out yet. I am a 30C and bought the smallest size."
4.0,"Comfortable, fun socks!"
4.0,"I got this sooner then I thought I'd get it, It's comfortable to wear & fits well, however i am a bit concerned about the thin chains so I will try and use care with it. If this brakes in a few months I will get another"
4.0,This should not be one size...definitely snug and I am an average size 8.
4.0,My girls loved the hat.  It was perfect for the cruise.
4.0,Tr√®s bonne
4.0,"These masks are just what I was looking for! Wanted ones with the nose and ear adjustments. Longer to cover the chin a little. Very comfortable, and easy to breath. Added filter to it. Wore it all day and never had any problems. Will buy them again for sure."
4.0,"Cute! Bigger than I thought, I kinda wish the post was more centered on the bird so it would be higher up on my ear I wear them in my second hole"
4.0,"The dress looked good on and fit normal however, the sleeves are really tight!"
4.0,I love it but except the metal tag at the back is missing
4.0,"I would definitely size up if you want a comfy sweatshirt. If you want something more form fitting, then go ahead and go  with your normal size. This is form fitting on me which I don‚Äôt mind if I‚Äôm not wearing anything underneath. But if I wanted to wear a thin t shirt under it, I would have purchased a large. The collar is also a little floppy but I don‚Äôt mind that. Here are my measurements:<br /><br />Bust: 36 B<br />Ht: 5‚Äô4‚Äù<br />Wt: 137-140 lbs<br />Short torso and short legs"
4.0,alot bigger ring than i thought
4.0,very comfortable.<br />rating 4.5
4.0,"The Relic watch is a rose gold metal. The strap is metal also and is dressed up with costume stones that give it a lot of shine. The movement is quartz, so it will need a battery about once a year. It is also not waterproof but can take small accidental splashes or drops into water. Gives you plenty of time to grab it before any damage is done. The bracelet is a two strand two-sized gold metal that matches the watch."
4.0,Very cute! the only down side is that the paint has started chipping after a couple of wears.
4.0,"This mask is very comfortable, breathable and works well in the heat and humidity. The only draw back is the metal nose piece.  After each washing I need to wiggle this back into place so it can once again be on the bridge of my nose rather than the side of my nose.  This is why I gave these masks 4 rather than 5 stars."
4.0,"Hey guys this long sleeve dye top fits like a comfy lounge piece you don‚Äôt want to take off .This top can be worn with a pair of skinny jeans or a pair of joggers for a day of lounging. I really love that this top is so versatile ,although this top is not a sweatshirt it still is an awesome long sleeve mid weight top. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 150 lbs. I ordered an xtra large which a large would of been fine so with that oversized look being so popular I roll the sleeves up and I love it .The colors are as expected"
4.0,"Husband likes these except wishes were longer, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô"
4.0,Love the dress.  But if you want it to fit like a actual dress then I would suggest you order a size up.  Fits like a bodycon. But see through. Wear all black under clothes.
4.0,I received it but haven't even opened it yet.  I'm sure it'll be fine for my upcoming trip.
4.0,Very nice band. Fits great. Love the gray color
4.0,the waist elastic is much less stretchy than the rest of the fabric. if your a little soft around the waist size up or you may get a little muffin top. but overall its made well and super compfy.
4.0,The product was too small. I ordered a medium like the chart suggested but had to reorder and the large fit great! Order a size up! Other then that it was very comfortable and the only bra I could wear after surgery. I tried several other ones and this was the only one that didn't hurt. Definitely order 2!
4.0,Really cool piece. Only downside is that it's damn near impossible to get it on and off without help.
4.0,"This is great to bring with you if you are traveling and end up needing an extra bag. It folds up small and zips to be stored away. The fabric is very thin, not for regular use, best for emergencies."
4.0,The material is very light which is not a problem. The problem is that because it is so light the front of the mock collar tends to collapse onto itself making an untidy appearance.
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because it's pricey for what it is, super pretty but pricey."
4.0,"Very cute for the price, but not would probably be best handwashed or in delicate and air dried"
4.0,These ate to tight so I don't know if it blocks the sun
4.0,Very nice. I was surprised by how nice the fabric is.
4.0,Looks and made good.<br />Made smaller than regular clothes.<br />Need to buy at least one size bigger.
4.0,"It's actually a very nice gown...just a little large, just a little brighter pink than I had expected...otherwise very, very nice!"
4.0,"THIS IS THE 2ND ONE I PURCHASED.  I RETURNED THE FIRST AS THE CATCH WOULDN'T HOLD.  THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THIS ONE.  I MESSED WITH IT, AND HOPEFULLY IT'S FIXED.  IT'S A LOVELY PIECE, BUT THIS ASPECT LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED."
4.0,These socks are just as I expected.
4.0,I love it but hate the material but other that that it cute just like the picture.
4.0,"I am a 36DD, 5'4&#34;. It fit perfectly. It has POCKETS!! The pockets pop out a tiny bit, but not bad! Knee length! Super cute."
4.0,Sadly these are cut differently from past 90 degrees ordered. I have ordered M in past so I did again this Time but these are just too tight. I handed them down to my mom.
4.0,"Ordered a large,  fits low at the waist and is a little loose.  I wear a 12-14 so I reccomend getting a medium. It's REALLY long.  Think 1980's Madonna. I wasn't expecting that but it worked and covered my rear-end like I wanted.  No show through.  There is a lining in it that works very well.<br />Mine arrived very wrinkled,  but easily fixed with an iron on low.<br />Overall,  great purchase."
4.0,"Love these hats, nice and warm without being bulky."
4.0,Loved this dress great fit !!!!!! Go up from your normal size
4.0,I love these earrings because they are different and go with many outfits.  I love the lace pattern cut into the chocolate colored wood.  They are amazingly light weight for a wood earring.  My only complaint is the flimsy posts.  I fear one day they will break off and I will have to replace the post. Other than that they were a great find.
4.0,It is beautiful but gave it to a friend since the shoulders do not fit me.
4.0,Rings were way too small for my husband  and I have no idea how to reach out to the company to get a different size.
4.0,"This bracelet is actually really cute and well made. It‚Äôs basically three different straps, two rope and one leather and it‚Äôs all connected. You put it on and tighten it by pulling the two loose pieces of rope at the end. I have a smaller wrist, so unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty loose on me and twirls around my wrist during use. It‚Äôs comfortable though and not irritating at all. If the leather strap had been brown instead of black, I think it would be cuter but that‚Äôs just my opinion. It‚Äôs a nice bracelet but with those tweaks could be better."
4.0,Kind of on the small side
4.0,"Like the feel and fit of these socks. They do seem quite breathable compared to some of the brandname athletic socks I tend to wear. However, I wonder if the breathability is due to a thinner or more spaced out weaving. The socks seem a bit on the thin side. They title the socks as ""casual use"" but depict people using them for sports like basketball and soccer. I like the camp design and they are eye catching. So, nice socks but I fear durability may be an issue."
4.0,"Esta bueno, se siente un poco delgado y muy elastico, pero se ve muy bien, la cintura si no se usa cintur√≥n puede bajarse con bolsillos pesados"
4.0,"As stated, Japanese movement. Nice, infinitely adjustable band. Korean company makes the watch, but my box says &#34;Made in China&#34;. Not a problem, just not what I expected from the write-up.  No date function, which is fine with me since I never use it and can't see it well. Very reasonable price, seems likely to last well."
4.0,My son who wears size 10 in shoes really likes these shoes. They feel good and he wears them for sports.
4.0,"Very think, nice soft flannel. Wears big for a KAVU large. Will still be perfect to layer with, etc."
4.0,"Like my other Toms, these aren't really comfortable, but they are adorable. I bought half a size up to accommodate my wide feet better."
4.0,the hood could have been just a little bit bigger
4.0,"Just received belt and size ,material,color appear what I was looking for.As to wear-only time will tell."
4.0,Uuum
4.0,"Overall fit is good. Cups are weird.. I'm 5'8"" 200 lbs. Size 38D. I'm also a current and past breastfeeding momma.. soooo, take this comment with a grain of salt. The boobie area does NOT have any support if you need it.. (and I DO.) So, yeah.. with some simple alterations,  this suit will be good for summer."
4.0,"Nice look, fit well, comfortable."
4.0,Very hard to latch
4.0,"Very large, but nice pattern.  Great fabric that is thin enough to use for tie"
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and fit well.
4.0,Very comfortable shoe. Would definitely recommend. They don't hurt your feet at all. Needed a new pair of shoes for hiking. Wore them straight out of the box. My feet didn't bother me at all.
4.0,I like the seamless design for comfort but should have bought the next size up.
4.0,Dress was beautiful!! Bought it to wear at a Mariah Carey concert in Las Vegas and received many compliments. The fit was perfect. I normally wear a Large so I ordered the XL. Very comfortable however just got a little rash on the inside of my arms from the sequins but went away the next day. Totally worth it!
4.0,I really like it but it‚Äôs alittle long. I guess it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs suppose to be but I didn‚Äôt know that.
4.0,"Great material and thickness, however, way to big.  Normally wear a large, but could of easily gotten a medium, maybe even a small. Plan to take them in about 2‚Äù on the inseam and an 1‚Äù on the outer seam"
4.0,"The Opal are small, but 10 beauties"
4.0,"This is a moderately padded case. I was expecting more, but it is sufficient for my purposes. It smells like plastic for several days"
4.0,Liked the color but it didnt look as good as in the picture. Returned it.
4.0,It was cute but no straps for cape
4.0,"I work in an industrial plant so I need a watch that was accurate and also cheap enough that if something happened I wouldn't be too upset. The watch is simple to use, easy to read and very accurate. It's a no frills watch that gets the job done."
4.0,I like the way this bikini looks and feels. Did not seem to be see through after swimming. But it was definitely a lot smaller on top than expected. Based off pictures I thought it would come down lower. So not what I expected it would look like for larger chested. But I still like how it looks. But expected it to be more like the pictures.  Would maybe order up in size for larger chested.
4.0,"I like sapphire crystals.  That, and the reasonable price, are what first attracted me to this watch.  I had a watch in for repair (crystal replacement--scratches) and thought this would be a good replacement.  I am rather hard on watches; there is no doubt that all I own have been worn, but this one is standing up very well.  I knew I wouldn't get scratches on the crystal, but I am surprised how well the stainless body looks after months of wear.  It really looks like new.  While I planned it for mostly dress wear, I like it so well it is almost an everyday choice.  As for as looks, it has the plain, classic look that never goes out of style.  Mine loses about two seconds per week so I reset it only every couple of months.  I would give it five stars if it had luminous hands or some type of backlight.  This is my second Wenger, the first being a GST Classic chrono.  Wish they still made them...<br /><br />Bob"
4.0,I am pleasantly surprised by this dress. It was marked prime and I expected to get it delivered faster but it was delayed and took a week. The dress itself is beautiful and we'll made. I am about 5' 5&#34; and the length is perfect for me.
4.0,"I picked this up at my local CVS this week, and I'm wearing it right now with gold-colored jeggings.  The material is a relatively thin, drape-y synthetic.  The neck is so large that I can't wear it without a tank top underneath for the &#34;professional&#34; look they show on the box, but overall it is comfortable and attractive on me.  I experimented and I can do both the one-shoulder and off-shoulder look, but I'd need different undergarments.<br /><br />I'd like to see this in red, and I'd like to find the taupe color they show on the box."
4.0,The shirt fits well and says what I want to say on game day.  The fabric leaves a lot to be desired but the message is why I bought the shirt.  Getting ready for football already.
4.0,very shiny and not flimsy at all
4.0,My four year old daughter LOVES these shoes.  She is very picky about how shoes feel on her feet and instantly declared that these were comfortable. She normally wears a 10/10.5 and had to go a size up to an 11.5.  She has gotten so many compliments in public about how cute her shoes are.  The only reason that I took a star off is because the shoes keep getting untied any my daughter doesn't know how to tie her shoes yet.  I have double knotted them and they still manage to become untied.  I'm thinking of either sewing the tie/bow in place or using fabric glue.
4.0,This brush was very useful in removing the dust and small stains from my hats. It fits comfortably in my hand.
4.0,The recipient seemed pleased.
4.0,"Honestly, u get what u pay for with this bag so the quality isn‚Äôt that great. The ears and horns are pretty thin and the ears were out of place when I removed it from the packaging.<br /><br />But to get it back into place, I folded the ears backwards and put weight on the bag and let it sit like that for about a day and the ears stood up straight after that!<br /><br />Other than that, I am obsessed with this bag! It‚Äôs sooooo cute! The sizing of this bag is not too big and it‚Äôs not too small. It fits my small wallet, purse & keys perfectly."
4.0,These earrings are fabulous and looks more expensive than they are. A great look for anyone biker or not. My husband loves them and if he is happy I'm happy.
4.0,"Another classy piece from Marycrafts! I was thoroughly impressed by the cut and design. It's a great piece for the office! I got a size 10. My body measurements at 36&#34;, 29&#34; and 37&#34;.  The material makes it a good fit for all seasons."
4.0,Neat design but WAYYY larger than expected.
4.0,It's a little small but not so that I needed to return it.
4.0,"This is a super attractive top. It is flattering and form fitting and should be worn with a bra, camisole, or other type undergarment. The fabric is thin and moves with my body. I love the peek-a-boo sleeves. It is true to size and the large fits me perfectly. It also makes me look more slender than I am and I am big on top.  The tulip-cut bottom is also extremely complimentary and goes well with leggings. However, I do wish this was about two inches longer on the bottom. It drapes down to my upper thighs and I am 5 feet 5 inches tall.<br /><br />The smell of the fabric is the only thing that prevented me from rating this 5 stars. I am hoping it washes away over time.  It is made in China of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex and is best washed in a lingerie bag in the washer and then hung dry. Tumble drying this tunic will destroy it."
4.0,Nice quality material. Ran a little small
4.0,"These glasses provide great polarization without over darkening.  I also appreciate the clean, conservative yet unique design. They do tint everything yellow/orange, which takes a bit getting used to, but not a big deal. My biggest complaint is they feel a bit heavy on the bridge of the nose. But I'll get used to that as well. Comes with a nice, sturdy case and cleaning microfiber cloth. So that's a bonus!"
4.0,Fits my husband very well.  He's a big guy and it fits him nicely
4.0,"Love it! Just hope that the straps were a little thicker, to supper bigger a chest better."
4.0,"Super cute!  Received a lot of compliments on these! Not for warmth, as they are sheer, and you will need a garter belt to keep them up."
4.0,"this dress is sized about as expected and the quality seems pretty good quality.  It also looks like the image and the image and the color is true to the image as well.  I would call it a solid 4 star buy.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,The earrings were of good quality....but I was very disappointed because my earrings wouldnt fit in my Helix Piercing....but all is fine ig.
4.0,Cute shirt the print is a little fuzzy. I still wore it but  quality of printing should be better
4.0,"I wish the fire truck was as defined as the picture. But, all in all it‚Äôs still really cute. It‚Äôs made well."
4.0,"small through the arms , restrictive , otherwise really nice"
4.0,"This is very sexy, after a few small alterations.  I'm 5'4&#34; and typically a size 8.  I'm also very busty (36ddd) so I'm not surprised that the bandeau top doesn't fully cover my breasts.  It actually looks really good, just covering a band across the center.  My problem is the bottom is too big.  I need to pull the bottoms down to mid to low hip.  Even once I do that, the bands running from the top to bottom have fairly significant slack to them.  Don't get me wrong, it is still very sexy and my husband loves it, but you may need to tweek it a bit to get the right fit.  I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
4.0,These jeans are so soft they feel like leggings. My daughter will not wear any other brand now. Love the prices as well.
4.0,i love it it's for my friends birthday and she'll love.  You have to assumble it your self it worth it. The material i thought would me would but plastic and the box came a little beat up
4.0,"Loose fit, dryer use not recommended, but it wasn't too wrinkled after being hung to dry. Good for layering, similar to tshirt material."
4.0,I‚Äôve had several Pro Treks and this by far the best one. It is a bulky watch but it is solar. It‚Äôs extremely accurate. The only problem I‚Äôve had with this one is the titanium band broke when the jeweler resized it. I put a paracord band on it and I like it better than the original. I haven‚Äôt tried it in water yet but the PAG240 that I had before wasn‚Äôt truly water resistant.
4.0,very nice and comfortable socks for kids
4.0,My 10-yr-old son loves them!
4.0,These were a hit at my Mardi Gras themed bday party
4.0,"I ordered a medium and the dress is longer than I would have liked. It‚Äôs also just a little tight, but I think I can work with it. Same with the length... if I had time to get it gemmed, I would, but I dont, so I think heels will just have to make it work. It‚Äôs a cute dress, overall."
4.0,"I actually purchased this waist trainer for my friend because she was interested in joining me in my waist training adventure. I was not able to actually measure her to see what size should would need, so I took an educated guess off what I would wear and went off of that. Going off what size I would wear the sizing chart was pretty spot on. She has room to &#34;shrink&#34; so to speak, which is a good thing.<br />The whole girdle is latex so she does tell me that she does sweat often in it, which is typical of latex and hot days, but she says that it does not bother her wearing it all day. She does not wear it consistently each day, so as far as if it is working or not, is still in the works. However, she does tell me that she is more confident wearing a smaller sized shirt because it helps to &#34;hold her in&#34;. She does tell me though that the upper part of the girdle is loose and I'm pretty sure that is pretty common as mine does that as well.<br />The hook and eyes seem to be holding well, but there are times when she bends down and the hooks will come out of the eye. Not exactly sure if that is because of fitment or because the hooks may be too small for the eyes. The boning of the girdle is nice and flexible which makes moving around less painful especially for all day wearing. Overall, the girdle seems to function nicely and it is not easy to see under clothing without actually knowing someone is wearing it. I am sure with tighter clothing, one could/would notice it on though.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for an honest product review."
4.0,"These sweatpants fit well and are cute! The fabric is a little more like athletic wear than comfy cotton, so I'd probably wear these if I went to work out in the morning or running errands. The pockets are also pretty decently big, so I could fit my phone comfortably."
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars becoz its to puffy for me , but elegant at the same time...."
4.0,It‚Äôs perfect for the pendant I made although I should have got a size longer
4.0,Itches a little but I love it!
4.0,This product is amazing quality but the sizing runs big! I would totally recommend to others!
4.0,"love this watch. i switched to the metal bracelet right away. eye catching and get compliments.<br /><br />i love the fact i don't have to turn any knobs and what not. the challenge is only remembering 3 things - turning off gps when on planes, daylight savings time adjustment (too bad it doesn't have that, and i'm dinging it 1 star for that, adjust time when in another timezone)."
4.0,"These socks say they fit up to a size 9.<br />I wear a size 8.5 in US Women and I felt like these socks were slightly too small for me.<br />The pattern on these socks are adorable.<br />The socks are well made.<br />The socks are almost on the thin side for wool socks but they do a good job of keeping my feet warm without being too hot.<br />These socks aren‚Äôt itchy or scratchy.<br />I‚Äôd recommend for someone with size 8 or smaller feet.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‚ÄòHelpful‚Äô button below."
4.0,"I wish I got on the free give away as other reviews state but it is well worth the price for this passport holder. I purchased two one for me and one for my wife. I recently renewed my passport and now have the chip which is something I do not care for as I travel frequently overseas and see so many people hung up in other countries (Canada is extremely strict) because their chip is sending error code from accidently bending passport, magnetic exposure or placing near transmitting electronics that wipe the data off the chip. Also in todays world there are more and more criminals that use skimming devices to get your information, and trust me your passport and credit cards have data that can really do a lot of damage in the wrong hands. With RIFD protection you really have nothing to worry about, as data is protected by shield within the leather. It is recommended when you go through any customs / boarder check point you remove your passport from wallet as they typically do not like being handed wallets, as it exposes them to risk of people accusing them of taking money or credit cards. Only complaint I have with the two I bought is that the Black one I purchased for me does not have PASSPORT imprinted in the leather as pictured in the photos. My wife's Red one which came at same time does have the PASSPORT imprint in the leather? Wife loves the Red as it is very easy to identify in her purse when traveling."
4.0,"If you are looking for a bagging shirt, this isn‚Äôt it. You should know that if you read the materials. A couple people said that they wear medium and this fit like XS....they must have found a stretched out medium to compare to, buy a size up for more loose fit, but true to size for a form fitting result. Don‚Äôt listen to the people who can‚Äôt understand sizes or that they are bigger than they are. Great shirt."
4.0,"The sticky tabs that come with it do not stick well at all, I had to use tape, but it is fun"
4.0,"Very nice sunglasses. I bought these to slip over my prescription lenses. They are a bit small as they don't completely cover them, but kind of sit on them, but beyond that they are great."
4.0,For smaller people they don't fit but for adults work great
4.0,"Very beautiful dress but too big for me. Luckily, i used it as a present and gave it to my co-worker which fit her perfectly"
4.0,The dress looks like the picture and it's very good material. I was pleased with the way it fit and as I loose weight I can still wear it. I bought a M for my pre-pregnancy weight 168 and hoping it fit when I get back to my regular weight 138.
4.0,Its flimsey but it does the job
4.0,"Its a pretty color (purple) . I didn't expect much for this price, but feel I got a good bargain. It is sewn well!  I will order in another color."
4.0,Love the hat. A bit too big but blaming that on the size of my peanut head and not the manufacturer. Delivery was on point. Would order from this company again.
4.0,"I adore this skirt... im 55 180.lbs and ordered the leg. Love it. If your any taller. It probably won't hit the floor. I'd give it 5 stars, but the zipper is a bear. I'm going to have it replaced... but, I will be ordering the red one, and the grey skirt. Great price, nice sturdy material too. Adorable!!!!"
4.0,Great for wearing around the house in the summer heat when all you want to do is have nothing on.  Light  enough to sleep in too.
4.0,"Sweatshirt is very comfortable.  The sleeves were a little long so I created a cuff.  Doesn‚Äôt take away from the look at all.  It did shrink a bit in length after washing, but still plenty long."
4.0,"This is purchase if you're looking to not break the bank buying gym clothes. These tops are light and fit well. I've put them through the wash a handful of times so far. So I can't have an opinion regarding durability just yet. However, since they come in packs of three, I don't see it being an immediate issue. The only down side for me is the lack of variety in colors but I'll definitely be ordering more in the future."
4.0,Nice apron but ran small. Also was hard for me to put on as I have limited mobility due to bad shoulders.
4.0,"The skirt is cute. I got an xs, It's kind of longer and fits looser than i expected. It feels kind of hot. It didn't fit my waist quite right but it's the smallest one. The belt did not fit by a long shot either, its very big so i had to put an another hole. I'm 5'2 and my measurments are 37-25-38 and i weigh around 128 lbs if that helps anyone when deciding what size to choose."
4.0,"Really pretty. Beautiful detailing. Looks much more expensive. Great value! My only concern is how long it will last. Fabric and detailing are delicate.  Even it doesn't hold up more than one summer,  at this price, I'd buy again! Definitely recommend."
4.0,Loved this dress and got many compliments. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and it fell right at my knee. I did wear tummy control bloomers under as it‚Äôs a swing dress.
4.0,For the price this is a very good pendant.  It's shiny and looks exactly as pictured.  The chain is a bit cheap and flimsy but it can be removed with little effort and the chain replaced.
4.0,"This hat is very cute. Felt nice but it was just way too big. I have an average size head and it came way too far down on my head and covered my face too much. I liked how it has the wire in the brim so you can adjust it but no matter how I adjusted it, I couldn't get it to fit right. Wish it fit better on my head.  It's super cute."
4.0,Decent case
4.0,Loose fitting and cotton-y for an easy breezy feel.
4.0,It runs smaller than expected but I love it anyway.
4.0,These little beach shoes are absolutely adorable.
4.0,Nice color no leaks
4.0,"I got this as a workout shirt for my girlfriend.  I was actually impressed with the quality of the material of this shirt. It is actually quite breathable and soft. It is also stretchy so it doesn't feel as restrictive as other shirts. The material used in making the front design is pretty good. After a number of washes it has yet to fade or start breaking off in pieces. The fit is exactly as expected. I have not noticed any loose strings, fraying of any proportion, and feels very comfortable to wear while going around outside or exercising in. She has gotten a lot of compliments and happy remarks from others about the shirt. It hasn't really shrunk nor has she noticed any changes from washes. The color and design also has great visual appeal. Overall I am quite happy with this shirt and I would definitely recommend it to others, especially as a gift to people you know who love to run and drink.<br />I would like to acknowledge that I received this product to test at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This does not influence my opinion about the product. I do my best to offer an unbiased and practical review from a neutral and &#34;every day&#34; person's perspective. I hope you found this helpful."
4.0,My 9 y/o liked this very inexpensive trinket.
4.0,"This product is great, but only had difficulty with setting it up. It was a bit difficult and time consuming."
4.0,This is my first pair of riding jeans. They are not as stretchy as I expected but I still like them. I normally wear a size 8 Wrangler Jean and I ordered a size 30. They fit good. Rode in them yesterday and they were comfortable and cooler than the jeans I normally wear. I wish they had a thigh pocket for my phone because it kept falling out of the back pocket but overall I am very satisfied with them. They look and feel good.
4.0,Bought a large.. but I should of bought XL I am a double D but small upper body thought i would fit right but too small
4.0,"It works (touch screen) but it's a bit small. It fits woman's hands but it looks small for bigger man's hands. Also, it says pack of 2 but I received only 1 pair."
4.0,"These shoes are great for running, working out at the gym or taking a stroll. They feel a bit narrow on my feet so I am not sure if I should have bought a size up from my normal size (9.5). However, the snug fit is still comfortable and does not cut off blood circulation.<br /><br />These shoes look fantastic and are well designed and manufactured. The is absolutely nothing &#34;cheap&#34; about them.<br /><br />They are very light on the feet and does not cause any noticeable drag during movement. I'm not sure about the benefits of the &#34;boost&#34; technology as there is no way for me to measure it. What I can say it that of all the athletic shoe brands and models that I have worn, this is one of the best."
4.0,"These are lightweight and fit well but they're kinda flimsy, didn't last very long. I'm an adult but have a small head so I usually have to buy kids sunglasses."
4.0,Wore them with heels for an outside wedding that i was a bridesmaid in. So much better than having to stand on my toes to not sink in the ground. they don't fit all heels but I wrapped a clear bandaid and then slipped them on.
4.0,The grey briefs fit great. The black briefs shrink slightly after a couple washing. Not a problem though. I ordered one size larger.
4.0,Good quality but a little undersized.
4.0,Mainly I use for fishing and it really helps cut down on glare.
4.0,Fine so far
4.0,"The smallest size was way too big, which is a bummer because it would have been really cute if it were smaller."
4.0,"So far so good, I have worn it once and was pleased"
4.0,"It was very flat when it arrived. So if you order, you will need to make several adjustments to bring the flowers and other parts up. Then it was so perfect for my needs,"
4.0,I love the pants. I'd give it five stars but the top is kind of big and I don't love the cut of it really. Still worth the pants.
4.0,"Bought it for my 5 year old, fits right at the ankle (she's 42 in. and rather on the slim side). Its definitely more of a royal blue than the dark navy I was expecting, but beautiful nonetheless."
4.0,"While I do find the sizing to be a bit smaller than represented, luckily, this one still fit me well. I was worried when I opened it that I would have to send it back, but after I put it on, I found that it actually is quite flowy- so no worries. It is extremely comfy and perfect for the summer. It also seems to be pretty well made, but like anything that has lace on it- I am worried how that section of the shirt is going to hold up. I am quite pleased with it, and may order another one, just to have as a back-up as I have already received so may compliments on it.<br />Product received at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Good quality. Love it!
4.0,Its two sizes too small.
4.0,Looks great in person.
4.0,"First The packaging looks very high end, although touching it takes that illusion away. That doesn't bother me though and the protection that was afforded to the watch was impressive. the watch however looks and feels quite nice. The mesh band doesnt pull my arm hair and should be sturdier than rubber which i like, but i took 1 star because the finish scratches somewhat easily and the edges of the watch band tend to snag on fabrics."
4.0,Fit well even though I'm short. Enough room for arms if a bit chunky. Just a little heavy.
4.0,Great all around sweater!!
4.0,Thank you!!!  Perfect
4.0,"Pretty little earrings.  They look to be real gold.  I would recommend these to adults or teenagers, as they are not large earrings, but very simple.  Very easy to get on too."
4.0,It worked. Good not great. It was a bit big. I used ribbon to make like a belt right below my breasts. I'm 5'2 125lbs. Was cute.
4.0,"very soft and a little thin but good stretch in the shirt. the sleeves are very pretty and the lace detail is exactly like the picture not sure if they have a stretch as they fit perfectly on me. The neck does not stretch, and if you have make up or your hair done prior to this on your body you might mess something up or at least get make up on the neck and it would be visible."
4.0,"The lens color is not nearly as dark as it appears in the photos. You can absolutely see the person's eyes through the lens when you look at them. While wearing them, it does a remarkably good job at reducing glare and brightness without being too dark."
4.0,As other reviewers have said this dress is incredibly sheer but fits nicely and isn't too short (I'm 5' 7&#34;)
4.0,Cute and have held up entire summer with a 10 year old putting them on daily. Shape is not as noticeably &#34;dolphin&#34; as I'd like but the color is beautiful and hasn't dimmed even with so much in the water wear. Great price
4.0,Very comfortable. I recently had foot surgery and it's fairly painful. These slippers help quite a bit. My only complaint is that they are quite warm and after a while my feet get hot and I have to take them off for a bit.
4.0,Perfect for for the controller but once you add the power cords and the stadia device it is very crowded in the case. If this is just meant for the controller then it does what it is designed to do.
4.0,I love these boots. I wear them all the time.
4.0,"Loved the colors, great fit."
4.0,They get the job done. Not too tight around the knees.
4.0,"I got this for my mom for a cruise she went on, for Mother's Day , she loves it !"
4.0,Very nice long vest....the price was terrific. I thought the fit was true to size. I will enjoy wearing it.
4.0,Only issue is with the put together.... they are very comfy they just look like a mismatch pair because of the lack of stitching compared to other
4.0,"Cute, material and design; but it runs smaller to the size. Order 2-4 sizes up for best comfort unless you prefer it on the snug side.<br /><br />Ex. If norm is16-28 XL, may need a XXL for roomier chest/torso area."
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, the only difference is that the middle part for the earrings has the mirror in it. Would've preferred extra holes for one or two more pairs of earrings."
4.0,Since I have 2 bad knees they are not fun to put on but I expected that....what annoys me are the zippers. They push into my leg and believe it or not make my leg itch from the indentation in my skin. Otherwise they have a good fit and you can wear them with the zippers on the inside of your leg or the outside whichever you prefer. I am wearing them because my doctor wants me too...not my choice so they may affect my opinion. On the up side they do stay up once you can get them on.
4.0,The pants run a little small so get a size bigger than what you'd normally wear
4.0,"Because of the cheap price, I was very worried about the quality, but the dress and all the accessories that came with it are all very nice. Gave 4 stars because the size chart is inaccurate. For example, if you wear a medium, order an x-large like I did."
4.0,Nice shirt. Seems well made. Slightly smaller than most &#34;medium&#34; shirts.
4.0,The dress is comfortable and very clean and classic looking with a modern twist.
4.0,This dress is comfy. I love the sleeves. It also has pockets!
4.0,Very comfortable! I definitely will be washing them inside out though so they don't fade.
4.0,"The top is great! Took out the kooky padding though, more comfortable and fits better without. Used black bottoms from another suit as the little polka-dot &#34;skirt&#34; on the bottoms totally rides up and looks bad. But the suit looks & fits great with the different black bottoms."
4.0,Arrived as descibed. Size fit fine.
4.0,I like this to help my clients adjust their mask with 1:8 inch elastic or 1:4 inch is ok too.
4.0,"The colors are vibrant, the fabric is thick enough that a slip is not needed, and the fit is perfect."
4.0,"Narrow, but did my homework- I happen to have a narrow foot- think I like these better than Yellow Box !"
4.0,"This bag is very pretty. But, It was shipped in a bag. Beaded bags are fragile, why someone would ship one in a bag is hard to understand. There is a little loose beading I am going to have to repair. If I order another bag like this I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs going to be packed right first."
4.0,"These are great, but the straps aren‚Äôt  adjustable which is why I‚Äôm only giving it four stars‚Ä¶ I had to sew mine to make them fit. Otherwise, super comfy!"
4.0,This earring is pretty but when I received the pin was broken...
4.0,"I love the bags style and versatility, not too fond of the color. Wish it was a nude color instead."
4.0,Purchased this for my son for his baby dedication and they were too wide and flimsy but served its purpose.
4.0,"They fit my pretty loose, which surprised me, because they usually fit nice and tight. I'm a size 8 dress and 7 in shorts, with wide hips and a large bum, so you can tell I was quite surprised how lose it was! Felt like I bought a size and a half too big! It isn't a large  chunk of space, but it's definitely noticeable and I have to constantly adjust them. Thankfully I can just cut and sew them tighter but be mindful!!"
4.0,Cute and exactly as pictured
4.0,It's okay.  The beard doesn't really wrap around the chin as shown.  Kind of splays out at the corners.  Fun though.  Still like it.
4.0,Socks are very cute but run small for a size 9 in mens
4.0,Wish these were a little larger
4.0,Decent purse.  Wife used it a few times.
4.0,"They are nice. A bit light weight, for my taste, but they work."
4.0,Bag does not fit 11x17 portfolios because the edges are rounded!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:db4e32adc8b6d4b9fdd38ad3e649c0ca]] This panda costume is very soft to the touch, warm for baby, and fits perfectly!  I was a little hesitant to purchase because the size range is so large but it fits my 21 pound 27&quot; long baby just fine, with a little room to spare.<br /><br />I was surprised at how warm and soft it is but the black on the material does shed a little bit, which is a bit of an issue.  The tiny fibers can end up in baby's mouth but are way too small to cause any kind of choking hazard.  I would recommend washing the outfit first before wearing.  If the fibers bother you, don't purchase.  It should also be noted that this outfit does not come with white socks.<br /><br />For the price at this time of this review ($14, shipped in two days with prime) I find it to be a bargain.  If you're thinking about this as a Halloween outfit you should definitely buy a few weeks in advance.  It'll give you enough time to test it out first and make sure it fits so you have enough time to buy another one if it doesn't."
4.0,just a fun flirty dress. great material
4.0,Very nice fit.  No problems
4.0,I guess I anticipated the size would be smaller. It was too big for my little cousin. Good product though.
4.0,A bit smaller than I‚Äôd hoped for but still pretty.
4.0,"This is the boot you want to take to war!!! It is a rock solid boot. It's a little stiff at first due to the Goodyear Welt but it soon loosens up and shapes to your foot.  It's got a ton of insulation which makes it unsuitable for warm weather. However, it's your best friend in cold and wet weather.  The only down side is that the 4E width was really only a little larger than a 3E. If you are expecting a Dunham or New Balance 4E fit, you will be disappointed.  These boots are more narrow than Dunham.  I had to to take mine to a cobbler to get them stretched. So far, they are great!  They will last for years if you take care of t hem. Great quality boot!"
4.0,Shoes  are super cute but fits a little snug on my baby foot. I would suggest size up
4.0,they seem like they wont be longlasting but I didn't expect a lot for price. artwork is great
4.0,"Nice overall shaping , wish the top  would come up higher under the arms."
4.0,I loved the design of this jacket. But would've liked to have much higher quality fabrics used. Otherwise  I loved it!
4.0,Great skirt! I‚Äôm very pleased. Great quality.
4.0,I like this sweatshirt! It fits nice its just not as soft as I thought it would be
4.0,These are nice but much smaller than I expected.  I guess that is what is meant by Mens!  I should have looked more closely.
4.0,They are very pretty and arrived quickly. They are not pierced earrings but do attach to the lobe of the ear and do not pinch
4.0,It is difficult to fasten to my wrist
4.0,Well made and very soft. I am 5'7 143Ib and got a M. The sleeves fit well but the waist is a little baggy. Cute and warm
4.0,A bit small around the hips but other than that it's fine.
4.0,"I bought these for my 13 year old son, and he likes them!  üòä"
4.0,"This was actually really cute, made of leather-ish(?) material. It fit my Samsung watch just fine. The springs will fall out of the band very easily before placement, so care and patience is needed. Once placed, however, it has been secure. I have received several complements, and it has held up well over several months and plenty of sweat.<br />Another drawback might be the loop used to hold the strap secure. It's a bit large and slips easily over the buckle. This part I don't expect to last long before breaking or simply falling off and getting lost. However, with previous watch bands I ended up using a ruberband hair tie replacement anyway, so I expect a similar result.<br />Overall, I enjoy the look and the band and would buy it again."
4.0,Nice and good value
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at the overall quality for the price. I was very pleased.
4.0,"Very cute dress and has a bit more ‚Äústructure‚Äù in the sense it flares out. Haven‚Äôt washed it yet so cannot speak to quality but I plan to do delicate, cold, or maybe hand wash. Low price so don‚Äôt expect amazing quality, but very cute for a special occasion. The straps are slightly long but not too bad. My kid is petite."
4.0,"Great watch, good quality."
4.0,Nice just realize it is quite large in size not dainty.  Sturdy chain pick the right snap and you can get a great look for the price.
4.0,"With the small bit of gold in the ring, it matches a lot of my wardrobe."
4.0,Fitted up top and loose skirt. The waist is a bit snug but nothing I can't combat. Beautiful print. All-in-all a great find!
4.0,Beautiful and excellent fabric
4.0,This sweat shirt is an excellent product.  It has kept me warm while shoveling snow here in New England. Made in USA
4.0,"Bought watch for my daughter  20 years old with special needs. She enjoys the camera and microphone  options in this watch. Very easy to set up just follow the instructions and side note, adult fingers might be too thick for the screen but is manageable for setup. Satisfied with purchase and I would recommend and would purchase again."
4.0,Cute top. Looks as pictured..The fabric is not a true sweater material but it is not uncomfortable. The length is great. I sized up to a medium for longer length.
4.0,Love it so much I wear it and I get a lot of compliments beautiful jumper
4.0,"The fabric is thicker and heavier than I expected, so much so that the weight of the skirts feels like it pulls the top down lower, but visually it isn‚Äôt noticeable. The extra stretch and weight also made the dress a little longer."
4.0,SUPER cute! I get a lot of compliments on these earrings. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they're kind of difficult to put on. Especially if you don't have nimble fingers. But I love how they look!
4.0,They are real nice.
4.0,"Runs pretty small. I am 5 feet and weigh about 100 lbs and the small is too small. I'd say the small fits like a US Girls 10/12. It's great otherwise, I just ordered the next size up and I will be returning this one."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, however, it‚Äôs very loose around the waist for me but it‚Äôs nothing a quick alteration can‚Äôt fix. I typically wear a size 00-0 depending on the brand.<br /><br />Also, the zipper gets stuck right as it reaches the waist (not a big deal for me because I can still squeeze it on)"
4.0,Good for mildly cold weather.
4.0,"These leggings are so soft  and comfortable that I wanted to keep them. However, the wild print just didn't look good on me. I am 5'4&#34; with a long torso and short legs, somewhat pear shaped so they just weren't for me. Maybe a subtler print would work, but they all seemed a bit too much."
4.0,"I really like these for my Chelsea boots. Good product and good quality but geesh they are expensive. If you have multiple pairs of Chelsea boots it could get expensive real quick.  Other than the price, id give them 5 stars"
4.0,"will most likely order again when I need to, the boxer are smooth and colorful, my husband loves them and so do I"
4.0,"This seemed to be good overall quality but I am very tall and with broad shoulders. The neckline just didn't work for me. Also the length was shorter on me than I expected. Probably would be fine for some ladies, just not for me."
4.0,"Don't you hate walking in a room and everyone with an Apple watch has the same rubber band on? AHH it drove me insane. Anywho, I finally decided I need new bands and I wanted something that I would wear dressed up and not feel like I just left the gym. I ordered from a previous company (more expensive) and hated the band, it looked so cheap whomp whomp. I was hesitant to buy another, especially for a cheaper price but I took the chance and it was well worth it! I got the rose gold and it matches perfectly. Looks by far more expensive than $8 so I'll be investing in a couple. HOWEVER, it does have its shortcomings. The edges of the band pull at everything! It gets stuck on sweaters, hair, scarves, etc. I find myself picking lint off of it when I take something off or put something on. If I run my hands through my hair, it snags it (ouch). Also, I would NEVER wear this to an amusement park or anywhere where it would come in contact with a lot of friction. The magnet is strong-ish for regular daily use. It does loosen and I tend to tighten it a few times a day with just standard movements. I do not trust this beyond that.  I find myself just double checking it regularly for peace of mind. For aesthetics, I love it (looks high-end) but for functionality it's still an $8 magnet."
4.0,Good fit. Flattering cut. Good quality.
4.0,"Too small for my liking. Very pretty, though."
4.0,"The style is very cute. In terms of size, definitely size down. I usually wear S, maybe an xxs would work for me here."
4.0,"Great dress overall, and I love the pockets.  The chest area is just a bit too small for it to fit 100% for my body type.  The body is a bit big, but I don't think I could do a smaller size because of the chest. I keep having to adjust the dress so that the black area is under my boobs and not in the middle XD"
4.0,"Runs very small. Normally, I can fit size 16 or 1x, so I purchased the 3x after reading the reviews. I like the flow and quality. It can be dressed up or worn casually. Leggings and boots are definitely the best for this tunic. I'm a big curvy girl (5'8&#34;- 190lbs) so I like that it covers the butt and hides the stomach. Overall, I am satisfied."
4.0,The skirt is a bit long. I might get it hemmed.
4.0,Cheap and they work.
4.0,"a little smaller than I expected, but otherwise nice quality"
4.0,"Soooooo COMFORTABLE! These shoes are somewhere between a 9 and a 10. I‚Äôm not convinced they are a 9.5. Anywho, the comfort compels me to keep them...and they don‚Äôt look half bad either. üòâ"
4.0,"Super cute bag, holds all my essentials going out and then some...however hinges squeak some as you walk and swing the bag, doesn't bother me but may others...great quality"
4.0,sheds
4.0,Love this ring very reasonable priced and stylish.
4.0,"Fabric quality is good. Stitches are solid. Very bright colors. They provide nice compression to both legs. Might be a little too much at the beginning if you are not used to. They are a little too long, but if you don't stretch them a lot from your ankles, they can fit right below the knee, otherwise they can go half way the knee.<br />I did not like that the sides of the toes are way too big/loose, that extra fabric next to the big toe and the little toe which might seem nothing in the pics but it is considerable while wearing shoes. If using them inside the house with no shoes, it's not a problem."
4.0,"Purchased this for my dad who is a frequent traveler and hates taking off his belt at the airport.<br /><br />The package arrived just wrapped in a plastic bag. Thankfully I was going to re-wrap it, otherwise the packaging made the belt look cheap.<br /><br />The leather is smooth and feels nice while the buckle looks like metal from a short distance.<br /><br />Overall this belt did what was promised. My dad didn't need to take his belt off at the airport and it held up his pants. What more could you ask for?"
4.0,it is a little thinner than I expected but I guess it would have to be to fit in the pouch.
4.0,"Cute outfit, true to color but not true to size. Size up! Not an itchy material but not a cozy material either. For fashion yes, for comfort no."
4.0,"Very pretty, but they are small, but I wanted them for my extra piercings. I must say they are a bugger to get the backs on them. Have patience. Nice."
4.0,Super cute. Everything came correct. Chain is very thin.
4.0,"A lot of people I know love to wear chronograph watches, but when asked how often they use the chronograph timers, it's not too frequently. With this ""Fashion Business"" style chronograph‚ÄîOntheedge 1853‚Äî, the chronograph can be used when needed, but equally important this watch is a nice one for a daily 'office watch' for business. The chronograph sub-dials don't clutter the dial, but when needed they can be clearly read. The date is displayed in an arc centered off 3 o'clock...showing two days prior and the next two days with the current date centered in the arch with a little red arrow. Displayed with black numbers on a white background, the date is easy to read. (See photo.) The deployant clasped-bracelet and case are stainless steel , the glass is mineral or sapphire‚Äîthe ad copy indicates 'mineral' and the caseback,  'sapphire.'‚Äî the back is a solid steel piece with a pry-off center for battery replacement. Also included is a 'link-tool.' (See upper right of photograph.) The link-tool allows you to remove links if the bracelet proves too large for your wrist. (Tip: Put the links somewhere you can retrieve them if you remove any.) Finally, much to my dismay, no documentation accompanied the review watch. To be honest, I didn't need it, but I can imagine some who might, especially for a chronograph...additionally, some may have no idea what to do with the link-tool. There's probably a web site somewhere with all the details, but I was unable to find one. Rather than printing up instructions in 2-point pica fonts to be read with a microscope, I'd suggest a little piece of paper with both a code-read image (QR image) and a URL to a generous Web page showing all of the details from using the chronograph to removing a link. Overall, though, this is a very cool watch."
4.0,"I'm 5'7 about 150 lb and  first ordered a large and returned for a medium. It fell about 2in above the ankle and was loose fitting in hips and legs. Bodice was formed fitting. Easy on easy off.  The choker was not the best fitting at times. Material stretchy and a little heavy for mid  July but wore it to my 60+ birthday party, which was a 70's theme party and worked well with many compliments."
4.0,"the dress look and feel pretty, but it's a little long for me. that why i gave just 4 stars."
4.0,I would give 5 stars but this is my 3rd bracelet from then and they all tend to start snagging after a few weeks. Other than that they are great. They hold well and color hasnt chipped/scratched off so thats nice!
4.0,I have to be stupid excited for a 5 star. I‚Äôm talking perfection. So that‚Äôs why the 4 star. These are great shoes. My son dances ballroom and they are perfect with the tiny little heel. I really am pleased.
4.0,a gift for a kind young child
4.0,reliable.
4.0,I was soooo excited to order this top and was so pleasantly surprised by the strip of lace down the back. It looks good on and I get a lot of compliments I just don‚Äôt like the way the line between the top grey color and the middle white sits right on my breast line. It looks awkward to me but I still like the top regardless.
4.0,This is a well-done charm. The details are readily identifiable. For me it stands for fitness walking and it's a definite keeper on my charm bracelet.
4.0,"I ordered Magnoli's professor glasses to serve as frames for my prescription. While I am very happy with the style and price, the curved metal that wrap around the ears took a couple of weeks for my ears to become accustomed to. I experienced some discomfort and irritation until my ears adjusted to the design, something that I had never experienced before with other pairs of glasses. That being said, they are comfortable (once that process is complete) and will not easily come off since the curved metal section wraps around one's ears preventing much movement. The design also means that removal of the glasses requires one to remove them from behind since the routine movement of slipping them off from the front creates a bit of discomfort on the ear. In my opinion, the peculiarities of the style are worth the additional hassle since it's the style I wanted."
4.0,Order a size up runs a little small
4.0,Absolutely love the look and feel of this dress. The torso is shorter than normal but that may also be due to having a large chest.  Its still super. Cute and i cam work with it<br />I love it and so does my honey.
4.0,Love them lasting really cute jeans
4.0,"I bought them for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. We went to a bounce house at several kids forgot to bring socks. I was grateful that I took the extra socks.<br />However, most of the kids wanted to take their socks off after a while because they were hot. These socks are decently thick.<br />They were borderline on fitting because most of the kids were aged 2, which I expected. I also bought these because I thought they were had more grippies on the bottom then they do. They are barely a bump.<br />Overall, they are good cute socks."
4.0,Quality dress. I just felt like a 1950's TWA flight attendant.
4.0,"Love this bag!<br />Just don‚Äôt wash it! Mine shrunk after having the bag for 2 months! Now, smaller and straps are now short."
4.0,I would give five stars but haven't had feedback about wearability since this is gift.  It did look lovely when delivered.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute and exactly how it‚Äôs pictured in the photo but I was expecting a little more *pow* than what the jewelry looks like, maybe I was expecting the color to be a little more brighterü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4.0,Very nice socks.. I haven't wash them yet but so far so good..
4.0,I really like this boot usually wear 91/2 in boots  but ordered these  in size 10 and the toe bed was just too short really  hated to send back
4.0,"Nice looking. A bit larger than I would prefer as a female, but a common problem, as most cuff links are made sized for males."
4.0,Simple yet effective
4.0,These are cute. The pants run big and the top fits just right. Definitely longer so I have to roll them. Im 5ft.
4.0,The look great for the price!
4.0,"Cute style, decent quantity but 10/12 a bit snug for 8 year old girl"
4.0,"It was a gift. But the person likes it.<br />It fit somewhat large to fit over another piece of clothing. That's what he wanted, that's what he got."
4.0,"This is a nice bra if you prefer bras this style.  I unfortunately don't, I like to have some padding at least so they keep their shape.  This is more something I would wear around the house.  I will say it's very comfortable and holds everything together and in place well.  The fit is very nice.  I have slept in it a couple times because it's so comfortable.  It's made well and the fabric is tough but soft.  I don't like the shape this gives, it's a little unflattering.  I think I would say to at least give it a try, don't pass it up if this is what you are looking for."
4.0,"I ordered a small size, but they send me the medium. It's not too large though. The overall product is awesome and delivery was quick than expected. Love it. Gonna buy another one."
4.0,Love it but is to big
4.0,"Hey ladies I just got my shipment in today I waited a very long time to try these bad boys on. That is my only complaint it took a month and a half to get them . My reason for the 4 stars is because there not the exact same as the photo and the star isn't as vibrant and cut like the picture shows. I like these because there different  you don't see a lot of people wearing this type of earrings . I wore them with a space shirt I have and they looked so cute with it . I put the earring on about 9 hours ago and my ears are not red and do not hurt at all . To be honest for the price these are awesome ,and they are my new favorite I am going to buy a pair for my nieces hopefully they come faster this time . Thank you for reading have a nice day"
4.0,"Great set of headbands.<br /><br />I bought these for use at the gym so I could watch my videos while working out without getting sweat in my eyes, they work great. They are a tad tight on my head. My one complaint is that I thought this was a sweat band set of 1 headband and 2 wristbands, my mistake. Also I would like to see a variety color pack so I could know which one I've used for a while and can wash."
4.0,"This costume is super cute. The only problem I had was the ribbon that is supposed to be laced up in front breast area, you can see it in my first pic. The loops to lace the ribbon just fell off and I had to just cut them all off and remove the ribbon. As you can see in the next 2 pics it‚Äôs not there anymore, but it still looks great. The shoe covers are NOT included in this outfit and I had to purchase more socks as the ones that come with it roll down on their own and it‚Äôs annoying. Otherwise great buy and recommend it. I bought a large and I wear size 8-10 clothing so it runs a little small. I drive a trolley and do Christmas light tours so this was perfect. I wear it about 3-4 times a week during the Christmas season, costume held up great and had it dry cleaned to make sure it doesn‚Äôt get ruined."
4.0,"These shrank a little bit in the washing machine but they still fit. They do get pills on them rather quickly, which is a negative. I'm honestly not sure how durable they'll be as they already look old after only a couple of washings. However, they're also super comfortable and very soft, they don't ride down, and they go with everything. For example, they look good with boat shoes, athletic sneakers, etc. In my opinion, they are unisex. As for size, they fit me just fine (size 8.5 M womens) and they also fit my husband just fine (size 11 M mens)."
4.0,"These fit just as pictured I have long legs and they still came up to my thighs. The quality was good and they look good, have not washed them yet so don't know what they will be like afterwards but for now totally satisfied."
4.0,Cute earrings. They look exactly as photographed. Great for holidays. Lightweight. Versatile. The bronze is a nice touch.
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute but runs large. Too bad it‚Äôs not offered in XS. Still, I‚Äôm having it taken in so it doesn‚Äôt gap at the back. Oh and the pockets are the bomb!"
4.0,"Good quality, delivery as advertised. Pleased with everything except that the necklace delivered is brown, not BLACK that I ordered."
4.0,"Really good price for a solid little piece.  I use it as a pendant.  It has a hand hammered look to it, which I think is charming.  Very happy with purchase."
4.0,Pleased with material and fit
4.0,"Boyfriend loves these. Only problem is that when I got it, it had a hole in the pocket. Aside from that, they are super comfy."
4.0,The wood color & grain are nice. The watch face was larger than I expected. I would buy another watch but make sure of the face size.
4.0,The design is cute. But the size is not true
4.0,"(A) Pros:<br />1) This attire, has a preppy look to it<br />2) The color of the dress, looks like, a pink peach color<br />3) The dress is above the knee<br />4) Stitching is good<br />5) A good amount of space (not too tight or too loose)<br /><br />(B) Cons: A for ""4"" star rating<br />1) The threading of the ""buttons"" was not completely sewn in the material<br />2) Loose threads, spreading on the dress<br /><br />(C) Dress Outline:<br /> 1) ""2"" pockets<br /> 2) Made of polyester & spandex"
4.0,"Good product, would have liked the sleeve length to be a bit longer (34/35) for me..."
4.0,reason why i gave 4 stars was because it got here earlier than i expected. looks really nice. !! but when i put it on my head a little stud fell off so i hadf to re put it in .
4.0,Very pretty and different.  Very light weight.
4.0,"Very soft shirt, just like the picture, form fitting."
4.0,Happy with watch. Lightweight. Rose color looks good. A little bit bigger than expected but not a problem.
4.0,"Comfortable, quick dry. Go from dress to work easily. Solid construction"
4.0,Ordered a large.  Should have orders  medium.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù4. 145.  The die dies run first wash.  I removed the cheap ties.  Worth it. Nice hoodie.  If get too large. The shoulder openings are low down arm lol
4.0,"I love everything about this dress. Beautiful material, fits perfectly, very feminine and flattering.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 140 lbs. I ordered the large and the fit and length is perfect. The green is a beautiful shade.  I‚Äôm glad I purchased it."
4.0,I really like the style and fit
4.0,These are a great inexpensive shoes. They look nice and my son says they are comfortable. We have purchased them before.  And loved that pair until he grew out of them.
4.0,"Great suit. It was a little big in the bust, but I made it work fine."
4.0,"I liked these but where the picture shows black in between the stones, it is gold, no black, but still pretty."
4.0,"i really like this bag and i really want to give it 5 stars. the only issue i have is the main zipper: it is fairly difficult to close and gets stuck more often than not. It's unfortunate. great bag that holds a bunch of stuff (macbook, padfolio, wallet, pouches, etc.) but the main zipper is problematic."
4.0,"Love it! It runs a little small for my liking, but arm length is good"
4.0,"The goggles are great for the price. You need to get a feel for popping out the lenses for interchange but that is not a big deal. I was a little disappointed in the foam seals which surrounds the lenses. It looks like they were adhesive backed or glued on and will most likely, over time, become loose and need to be resecured or replaced. Other than those things, these are good riding goggles for the price."
4.0,After looking at others review I ordered a small. The top was a little hard to put on but the bottoms fit just right. I'm 5'7 1/2 and 148 pounds. I got so many compliments in this outfit I will definitely be ordering from this company again. This was my first ever purchase from a clothing vendor on Amazon.
4.0,"I liked the way this. Dress fits.. a little roomy up top, but very sexy!"
4.0,Smaller than I though they would be but my granddaughter loved them
4.0,A little oversized but works for kids.
4.0,"I like the pattern and the fabric.  I used the measurements given and ordered a large which seems a bit too large - I normally wear a size 12 - 14.  However, it's better to be a little large than too tight since there is nothing to let out to make it bigger.  The sleeves have 2 d-rings each to fasten the sleeve with a single tab from inside but I doubt that I will use them."
4.0,I‚Äôm really sad this shoes have the incorrect size because they are not a size 4 but more<br />like 1.5 or 2 at max. My daughter loved them and the quality seems to be very good however they do not fit and there are no more sizes... it‚Äôs really a shame!
4.0,"The NINEWE Women's Plus Size swimsuit is very flattering! I have a swimsuit  similar to this that was old and worn out. I thought this would be a good replacement. This was a fantastic replacement! The first swimsuit was a halter, which I had to keep tightening and wasn't easy to swim in. This one has wider shoulder straps that keep the swimsuit up. The crossing fabric under the breasts is flattering for women, like me, with wider mid-sections. After the crossing material it flares out in to an A-line dress. The best part is underneath it's boy shorts!<br /><br />The reason I give this swimsuit 4 stars is due to the underwire. The breast area has an underwire that pokes me and that is uncomfortable, so I am considering removing it. The only way I can see to remove it is cutting through the fabric which is my hesitation.I do like the support it gives, but every time I wash the swimsuit or have to put it on the underwire shifts and it is sharp. This swimsuit also comes with extra padding for extra lift and support. There is another issue I have, but it is not something that is a product flaw just a personal opinion. The &#34;dress&#34; part of the swimsuit floats up while swimming. This gives you an underwater Marilyn Monroe thing and you are grateful there are shorts attached. Overall, it is a comfortable (except underwire), well-designed dress that is flattering on plus sized women!<br /><br />Given sample to test and return my personal honest opinion. I did not promise anyone a high ranking, nor speak with anyone before submitting my review."
4.0,"Only dislike is that pleats need to be ironed with every wash. Fit great, appropriate length, and very cute! Wish I had gotten a better picture...will try to update the next time I wear the dress."
4.0,A little bulkier than I imagined but still very pretty.
4.0,"So far, so good. Like it, but it is fairly large, so I expect it will stretch out very soon."
4.0,"Arrived on time, fit as expected. It's a loose blouse that looks nice with jeans or slacks. I rated it 4 stars though because mine arrived with a hole in the side of it straight out of the package. I did not choose to contact the seller because honestly, I'm so exhausted of receiving brand new items that arrive with rips and tears from amazon/sellers. I'm sure if I had, the seller likely would have replaced it - but quality control is crucial, and sometimes people don't feel like having to send stuff back, wait for a new one, etc etc... I stitched it up myself and it will do."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely stunning, we had to return the first one because the zipper is broken, looks like a cut? Other than zipper dress is perfect fit and would look wonderful. Sending back dress with faulty zipper, and ordering replacement. Will update when replacement arrives."
4.0,Chain is an awkward length but the key is adorable. I'll probably just put it on a diffferenr chain. It's very cute
4.0,Purchased this for Haloween costume and they were exactly what we expected.
4.0,"I have used this model for years, mostly because  of its' low profile and cost.  My main gripe is that the retainer band fails."
4.0,This was my first watch band replacement. I was impressed with the quality of the band for the low price I paid. Smells really good like an expensive leather shoe. Its  little stiff but I have not broke in yet so not sure if that will change.For the price you cant go wrong.
4.0,The dress is so comfortable and I get lots of compliments !!  It was too long and I had to have it shortened but I‚Äôm only 5 foot tall!
4.0,Fit perfectly came on time as expected.. look exactly like the picture. My daughter thinks there very comfy and cute
4.0,Very cute but not that warm and fingers are just slightly too long for me
4.0,Nice n' soft fabric.
4.0,All anyone could want in a ugly sweater
4.0,"I am 5'1&#34; 130lbs and anything that I don't have to get altered in length is a plus. The dress is a perfect length and very soft. I purchased a small in the blue and the color is exactly is pictured. The bust is a little tricky, as it is an empire waist, and if you're endowed in the chest area it will fit awkward. It will &#34;pull you down&#34; and your bust won't fit in the cups evenly. For the record, I am a 34D."
4.0,These were bought to wear with a costume for Halloween.  So I cannot really answer these questions.  I have tried them on but not worn them for a long period.
4.0,"The material is 100% cotton, soft and breathable, it's thin, very suitable for summer days.<br />The dress is simple and elegant, the sewing is also not bad.<br />My daughter will be 3 years old, 38"" tall and 33 lbs, she's already wearing clothes that are four years old. And this 4T size also fits her. I think she'll be able to wear it next year if it doesn't wear out. She was very happy with her new dress and liked to spin it around.<br />My personal thought is that the bottom is a little large."
4.0,"I have owned several Rolex and Breitling Swiss watches. Recently I purchased a Glycene Combat Sub automatic and it exudes quality in every component. What more could one want in a divers watch: coated sapphire crystal, ETA movement, 30 ATM, sturdy 60 click bezel, rugged stainless steel band with a secure deployment clasp, large readable dial and mammoth second hand. This is an incredible value, not a cheap knock-off. The true measure of this timepiece will be durability, so I will wait to see if it is  truly multi-generational.p"
4.0,I loved the fast shipment and I love the product style.  The legs are a bit much but with the right top it will be great
4.0,"The glitter is crazy!! Also, it is dry clean only :sigh:"
4.0,"I love the moon part of it and the chain, but I'm currently looking for a different charm to replace the &#34;planet&#34;."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, looks just like picture."
4.0,It's a great suit that covers just right.  Not too much but it's not skimpy either.  It definitely sucks everything in and holds it in place which is why I'd say it runs a little tight.
4.0,It is an ok product.
4.0,Like these dividers.  The fit nicely in my hard case suitcases.
4.0,I like the fit.  I wear a 6-8.  Got this in a medium.  It fit very well.  You do need an undergarment (slip) to wear with it.Can be sporty or fressed up.
4.0,Decent necklace.  Took a little over two weeks to get delivered.
4.0,Love these pants. The are soft and silky. Very comfy. Everyone always asks me if they are lulu lemon. Only downfall is the sizing is not consistent. I own several pair of medium and some fit perfect and some are too loose. Only difference is color. Still love them.
4.0,Love these googles. Not a swimmer yet. Needed goggles to protect my contacts while doing water aerobics. Love the fit. Not too tight n not too loose. Only problem I have is I mad a mistake while cleaning the lenses n wiped some of the inner lens n it will fog up. Outside of that no problems. Easy to put on n take off.
4.0,I bought this shirt for my husband.  The I.T. Crowd is our favorite comedy.  I bought the 2XL and it fits a little smaller than other t-shirts I've bough in the same size. Very well made.
4.0,"I really like the sunglasses!  They fit well over my eye glasses and are very fashionable in my opinion.  However, they are a tad bit large for my face, but I'm keeping them and wearing them anywayüòÉ."
4.0,Band at the bottom kept riding up to under my chest. Had to tuck it into my jeans / skirt in order to wear it.
4.0,"Sleeves are a bit baggy and mid-section is somewhat larger compared to most shirts this size. I have purchased many many brands, trying to find the perfect fit. This is a nice quality shirt though and may shrink somewhat in the wash so I am not complaining for the price. Plus the color is perfect for what we were looking for!"
4.0,"Not as dressy as I expected; but, a nice everyday piece of jewelry."
4.0,Fit well. I made the hat sexy..great quality
4.0,Overall I like this hat.  The brim size is perfect for protecting my ears and forehead from summer sun.  Love the light gray color for mowing the lawn or landscaping the yard.  The reversible camo pattern is nice but I prefer the darker color to be on the under side of the brim to reduce sun reflection and glare.  I would give five stars if the brim was a little stiffer and less resistant to bending out of shape.
4.0,"Great jacket, simple style. Loses come color and shrinks when washed but gives it a slight worn look and shrinking can be fixed with steam."
4.0,"These work great! Got them because my husband, son, and myself all wear glasses. I CANNOT stand it when my glasses slide down my nose or cut into the back of my ear. These prevent both from happening. Only thing I didnt like is that with me having long hair, it was difficult to get glasses handle bars on, behind my ear, without pulling my hair"
4.0,I ordered a medium and got an extra small. Very disappointed. The dress is pretty though.
4.0,The larger 15mm earrings are comfortable and look great.  Especially handy is that they are hinged so they are easy to put on and take off.  Just regret the smaller 2 pairs don‚Äôt fit for me.  Still a good value for the money.
4.0,Nice tie. The color and print is true to the picture.  The size of the tie is a touch narrow than most ties come in my opinion. Bought for a 14 yr old and it fit him ok.
4.0,It fits great tops a little small but that's ok other than that I love it
4.0,My daughter wears a size 1 tennis shoe so I bought a size 1 in this as well.  They fit just a little big maybe 1/2 to whole size big but the strap seems to hold them on ok.  I suppose she can grow into them and she was to impatient for me to send them back for smaller ones so we are going with it.  At least I‚Äôll get longer use out of them!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:1564f073072bb9546da308b8754c955f]] Not as gold as they make it seem, has more of an orangey sunset tone than gold but it still looks gorgeous!"
4.0,"Bought this for my 10 year old son, shirts fit great. The shorts are a little small in the waist"
4.0,Ordered a medium and the pants are a little big in the crotch area<br />Still super cute
4.0,"Zips, stores, and protects glasses"
4.0,Fit as expected...color is a little off overall love it
4.0,Love the jeans but they run very long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and had to have them altered.
4.0,Was a gift and she loved it. Unsure about how it held up or if it has tarnished as she moved to another location.
4.0,I purchased these for my son and they Fits my 12 year old perfectly. Very nice shades that you will enjoy
4.0,I have purchased two of these snappy visors. They are akin to a bike helmet beak only attached to your glasses or sunglasses. I love that they are lightweight and I have yet to have my glasses blow off of my head due to high winds. Four stars only because even with the little bands provided this visor does not several of my glasses with wire type frames
4.0,"Cute dress but looks cheaply made up close.  I'm 5'5, 115lbs and ordered a small"
4.0,My girlfriend loved this dress
4.0,"These sandals are nice but a little wide, keep in mind i do have narrow feet and it's not like the regular 7 is coming off of my feet but they're a bit loose.<br />That said, I like the color and snakeskin tone to them and that they're a nice wedge heel without being too high to walk in.  Fairly comfortable as well and they go with a lot of outfits."
4.0,"I was really excited for this top to come in. I got it in black, looks nice on and good quiality but the only thing is I followed the sizing guide measurements exactly and it was still a little large on me.<br />For reference I'm 34C, 5'5'', about 145 athletic build and the large was too big on me. Even with a strapless bra its a little large.<br />If the exchange process was easier I would exchange it for a medium but the item took about 2 weeks to get here (shorter than the expected shipping time which was great) but I'm too impatient to exchange it as I still really want to wear it even if it's a little too big!"
4.0,"I like this dress because it's comfy and doesn't need a belt. There is a hidden zipper on back and the silver zipper in front. That's a little weird, but you get used to it."
4.0,"The tuxedo was nice. Unfortunately it ran small, and my son couldn't use it. It stated pants to be 28/30 and we received a 27.  Had it fit correctly, it was worth the money."
4.0,"I really like this sweater a lot‚Ä¶ except for one thing. It bells out at the bottom. It fits really well until it gets to my hips and then, like I said, bells out in a weird way at the bottom.<br />I was able to fix this in my own way. I cut up one of the torn up areas and tied it in a knot right at my hip. It worked out really well and I like it a lot more after doing that. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that at all in the first place. Other than that‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs soft, thick, well made. I was pleasantly surprised. You never know what you‚Äôre gonna get when it comes to clothes on Amazon. It‚Äôs not one of those itchy sweaters where you have to wear a full long sleeve shirt underneath. It‚Äôs nice and soft and comfy."
4.0,Its really cute but a tad bit short. I recommend wearing like an underskirt with this but other than that you will look cute in this :)
4.0,"I saw that these Sox were made w cotton.  With narrow feet,  I‚Äôd been looking for Sox with smaller toe box bc others I tried were too big, folded over and were uncomfortable.  I‚Äôm glad to find these bc they fit.  The designs are fun."
4.0,Really long on 5'2&#34; height. Need heels for sure to not drag a lot of material!
4.0,"Super-cute, but check the button to be sure it's securely sewed in place. Ours fell off in the wash and since it's an accent, the shirt isn't quite the same without it."
4.0,"Nice hat, good fit. Too soon to know how it will hold up."
4.0,"I'm using them for an aerial class. I love that they have no middle seem.  I wouldn't say that they're see-through, but I generally wear dark underwear underneath the leggings for my own added comfort/modesty.  I'm 5/10 and 150 lbs and ordered M/L."
4.0,"I asked a question. &quot;are they true to size&quot; and the majority of answers from purchasers was &quot;no&quot; buy them a size smaller.  I did and they fit good.  9.5 US, a little snug but they'll stretch.  For the price, I think they're a good value and comfortable.  The look good and are light.  They're exclusively indoors in spite of the plastic sole.  You can tell they will crack and separate at a hint of moisture.  The will most likely breakdown as they're worn.  Mine are new, fresh out of the box but I anticipate the foam will collapse w/time but for the price you could buy a pair every three months and still feel good about what you're spending."
4.0,"The pattern/color fades quite fast and easy, but still a cute band."
4.0,"Bought almost a year ago. Holds up well even thru hot, humid weather."
4.0,"I love the fit of this coat. Not at all boxy, and great for the price. The lining‚Äôs quality leaves a little be desired, but all in all is totally worth the price."
4.0,I liked the tags but it was hard to open the loop so I could attach them to my bags.
4.0,"Feels like silk.  This runs small.  I find that this shirt pulls across my shoulders and bust (I bought Medium and am a 34DD bust size, I wear a size 6 in Lululemon shirts).  However, it feels nice on my skin and breathes well even when I am quite hot - I enjoy wearing this while running."
4.0,Good smell. I took one star away because it took a little bit color away. and not really shinning after use.
4.0,I like it but I think it's a little expensive
4.0,"I love the top, it just runs a little big for my taste.  I know baggy is in, just not for me.<br />Good, quality material. Color is as shown.  Would order again if they had an XS."
4.0,"Attractive but did not fit my face,"
4.0,This dress was cute and comfortable.  Unfortunately the pleating was not flattering at all to my hour glass figure.
4.0,Excellent product ... pretty colors!
4.0,It would fit a guy better for sure! But good colors and made well.
4.0,Colour nice a bit big but i take it in.
4.0,Cute comfortable fabric however fit bigger than i thought.
4.0,Pretty dress. Good deal for money.
4.0,"It‚Äôs awesome to know that your purse is not touching the ground where other people‚Äôs feet has been!!!  Also, at times I place my purse on the table, now I have more room. The only cliche, it‚Äôs difficult with round edged tables.  I always have it with me, awesome!!"
4.0,I like this shinning cowboy hat necklace! It's really cute. I wish it was in a longer chain but it's still really cute!
4.0,Material is thick and warm
4.0,Thin material. Pants wont be long lasting. Kinda like old navy pants. They do have nice style. For the price cant complain too much.
4.0,I love everything in this bracelet.
4.0,"I ordered two, white and &#34;coral&#34;. The white is cute and fits great. The other wasn't coral, it was BRIGHT orange. So, if you like bright orange, order the coral one. If you like coral, well, they don't actually appear to make it in that color. I'm assuming I didn't just receive the wrong color since they don't list bright orange as an option."
4.0,Great just as the picture showed but it was too large due to me not measuring properly.  Nothing I couldn't fix with a needle and thread. I hope I never lose my bag now.
4.0,Great features with removable insole and 2 types of material on sole of shoe.  Very good construction but ran very short.
4.0,Happy with this purchase....very comfortable and nice material
4.0,I used this for my costume.  The light weight made it comfortable to wear around my neck.  The color is a bit more rust then actually grey but that didn't bother me.  I knew that from reading the other reviews.
4.0,"Had them for about 2weeks now. I like them but for some reason I thought they‚Äôd be more sturdy, stiff or built of a stronger metal. I still like them and use them so no real complaint"
4.0,"A lot better quality than I was expecting. Got it as a stocking stuff for a girl and she uses this bag to carry her pokemon cards. Its a cute, small bag that seems to hold up okay in an 8 year olds grasp. I don't expect it would hold up to terribly long if used consistently and aggressively,  but as a functioning novelty item for children it seems to work out great"
4.0,This was a good gift for my friend and he is a huge fan of Naruto and the Asatsuki.
4.0,The dress smelled like gasoline when it had arrived. But i got that out so no worries.
4.0,Super Cute For My Curvy Body!!! Price Right Material Is Decent Too...
4.0,Really cute sweater in a great green color. It runs a bit large and a bit short. It wasn't for me but I could see it being a popular choice for a younger crowd.
4.0,"wanted to love this, but it was just too long and boxy for me"
4.0,"The badge on the front could be higher quality,  but this is easily replaced. The garment is well built, good heavy material."
4.0,Very cute. Fits as expected gave 4 starts only because the shorts did fade a little after first wash but not the shirt. Can‚Äôt really tell but other than that really like it.
4.0,These are always great.  Can expect a few you'd never wear except for Halloween or something but try to beat the price for these pretty good ties.
4.0,Cool pair has no UV or polar protection. :/
4.0,"Pluses:<br />I was looking for a watch that I could read easily without putting on my glasses, and this does that job well. The black on black finish will go with most any attire from work-from-home casual to business casual.  If it had a black metal band I would even wear it to a formal event, but that isn't what I expect out of a $20 watch.  I just want to know what time it is.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />The band is a cheap looking fabric band with a buckle and a couple of rings that can be used to tuck in the unnecessarily long tail of the band. I replaced the band with a Timex Q7B816 Expedition Sport Wrap because I prefer a velcro to a buckle, and frankly even the $10 Timex band looks better to me than the band the watch came with.<br /><br />The crystal is raised above the case which will make it easier to scratch. The watch was only $20, so if it gets scratched I won't lose any sleep over it."
4.0,Shirt does not disappoint. Great printing. I just wish shirt was a higher quality shirt but definitely the standard shirt so not low quality. I would buy again. Perfect for gym.
4.0,"Looks very nice. Its a gift so, can't say if recipient will like it. I do think that the chain could a better quality. I may change it out myself. Other than that, It is worth the price."
4.0,"it does help, i can stand longer with minor pain"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. The bracelets were exactly as pictured but were a bit too big for both of us. The only thing I feel I would change about this product is I would make it adjustable. Still a nice buy overall.
4.0,"I am am 5'10"" 200lb (athletic build) AA woman. I haven't worn this dress out yet. I bought the royal blue color. I ordered an XL because I didn't want it too tight. I normally wear a L but it probably wouldn't have hit just above my knee. I wanted the length more than the form fitting feeling.  When I tried it on it came just above my knee. I wanted something mid calf but the dress will do."
4.0,"I really like these pants so far and im hoping they will hold up after i wash them. I have to be honest, i was hoping for a wider, flare leg and thats not what these are. At least if you are a size 14/16, thats not what theae are. They are comfy and they hit the floor (im 5'9&#34;). Although the legs are not as wide as id like i would buy them again as they seem like they will be great travel lounge pair of pants."
4.0,"just like in the pic , but it had such a nasty smell to it tho and its super small , more like something to hold change in and after a while the smell does go away"
4.0,"Got this for my daughter for her birthday, and she loves playing with it."
4.0,So soft!!!! Love this. Ordered a second one
4.0,"This fit as expected look great. Only thing I didn't like was I thought the pink part was a solid piece of cloth, but its not. Has 4 stripes of pink elastic and in between each stripe is see through mesh."
4.0,"The wallet is great. Fit and finish is excellent. I‚Äôve been using it daily and it has held up well. I am not sure about the long term. It does feel pretty thin, so I‚Äôm concerned it won‚Äôt last past 6 months, but I could be completely wrong. For the low price, I figured it was worth a shot, because I‚Äôm curious about this design. The company puts an MSRP sticker in there that says $95. Don‚Äôt be fooled by this. While it‚Äôs nice, this is not a $95 wallet."
4.0,Beautiful. Fits a little snug but been losing weight so in a couple of months will fit perfect
4.0,"5 stars for how much my son LOVES these surprise boxes. Dropped a star for the inconsistency in quality of the prizes. My son is 4 and I used these boxes to get him to practice his writing. Every time he did his homework he got a start, 3 stars... pick a prize. He loves it"
4.0,I was missing one of the letters that I needed badly. It was just a simple mistake so I gave it a 4 they glow really great!!
4.0,Best purchase so far as a diaper bag and every day bag. I got tired or lugging around a second bag for my kids so I decided to use this bag. It's room and easy on the eyes. The only thing I did the like about it is that the straps are a little too narrow and light. Thicker and wider straps would be better.
4.0,"I live in a major Colorado ski resort town and am on the hill around 100 days a  season. These things are crucial, truly a must have.<br />  I've had brand name &#34;Buffs&#34; and these are almost as good. Wicks away moisture well , keeps your face warm, and overall keeps you going. I wear mine in a balaclava style over a beanie and under my helmet. Some are too thick and don't breath well enough, allowing moisture to build up and freeze. It sucks when that happens because you then have a 12 oz ice cube hanging from your chin.<br />  THESE ARE THE BEST OF THIS STYLE FOR THE PRICE. You can spend more but quality enhancements would be negligible. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because they are not stitched or finished at the ends. Basically they will curl a bit over time. No bigs, just flip it so it curls in and you're good. I now own 5 of these and as long as my girlfriend doesn't steal them they are a great addition to my winter armor."
4.0,Cute but not the best.
4.0,It fits good. I'm a petite woman and I thought it was going to be too big but it fits.
4.0,"I was a bit disappointed with the medal.  It needed to be a little more detailed, hard to read it.  It was a gift for my neighbor girl for her Confirmation.  She seemed happy with it, though."
4.0,Me encant√≥ el dise√±o. Es super pr√°ctico y tiene una excelente calidad.
4.0,pamts too small not as advertised
4.0,I really liked this coverup but it was huge!! I returned and was unable to swap it for a smaller size.
4.0,This top is very cute but I would recommend getting the size you usually get when you don't want it to be tight :)  I ordered a medium because most of the shirts I get from Amazon (not made in China) are HUGE or too long and not laying on the hips in a way that is flattering.  This one is different - hits at the top of my jeans.  The fabric is very soft and it didn't seem to shrink when washed or dried. The holes did not fray either - so far.  The cold shoulder holes do not have finished edges.
4.0,"Almost on the small side,  I hope my kid doesn't grow too much in the coming months!  But a stunning color, she loves the high low hem, and the beads around the neckline are pretty.  The flowers are definitely lesser quality than I expected and I'm going to get a little crafty to fix them up the way I want them to look.  For the price it's a great value."
4.0,These are a basic for me and I order a few times a year as I retire old ones that are worn out.
4.0,"For the price I paid, it was good.  I have seen other hats cost more than 3 times as much.. But this one fits fine.."
4.0,"Very flattering, good quality"
4.0,Great product but misleading I thought it was a multi pack.
4.0,Very cute and a neat novelty gift. Great for looks but would never hold up as a watch/clock. But I bought it as a novelty and the price was right. Adorable
4.0,"Most people love Christmas Vacation. As much as I love that one, the original is my personal favorite."
4.0,They work great I plan on getting more
4.0,"Great condition, feels good<br />Only thing I have not wash them yet so I'm mot sure if color and quality holds up"
4.0,"These really are tiny earrings; they'd be great for little girls, but on me, the loops barely make it around my ear lobe. They aren't uncomfortable, though. I imagine someone with larger lobes might feel pinched. They are nice and sparkly and do not make my ears itch or turn red. They are very solid looking, but lightweight."
4.0,"Love the style of chain and is the perfect length for me at 22‚Äù, the circle is nice."
4.0,They work great! They are very dark but will be perfect for very sunny places!
4.0,Smaller in the bust but a really great dress. Very pleased!
4.0,"Very sleek and sexy, covers well and just an overall feel of confidence when they are on!"
4.0,"Very small, looks good though"
4.0,"I usually choose light padding and no underwire. This is the opposite, but was flattering. The fit was accurate. I wondered if there would be enough coverage without padding but it was fine and the support was good. It's a pretty bra and comfortable."
4.0,"Good product for the money, but like a lot of plus size clothing was wide enough but no where near long enough. Great if your not especially tall, but avoid or go up a few sizes if you are tall."
4.0,Perfect clear bag and meets NFL stadium requirements.
4.0,Fits perfectly.  Doesn't dig into the eyes and very comfortable to wear.  No more water leaking from the sides.
4.0,got this for my grandson but didnt give it to him yet but i know he will love it.i find the tooth itself very small tho and dont expect it to last very long.
4.0,"I‚Äôm small but big breast, I got a large and still kinda snug, suggest x-large if you have boobs. Also sheer material!"
4.0,Got these for my sons for Christmas. They both think this is a cool product and seem to be enjoying them. Easy to pair with device and operate.
4.0,"I bought a set of these for my 10 month old. He is an average baby size, with well developed thigh muscles from bouncing and baby swimming class. The top band can get to be a bit too tight on his thighs. keep that in mind!"
4.0,Looks like it does in the picture.
4.0,Wouldn‚Äôt stay on thumb
4.0,"So first off I was not given this product for free to leave a review. I am not being compensated for this review. So I must say, this works just as stated, they get dark when outside in the light and go clear when you are inside. Awesome quality, the lenses actually fit better in the spots than my Oakley glasses lenses. The quality is high, I usually am rough on my glasses and these seem to be holding up very well, I have used them for almost a week now. When I first got them, I put them in my sunglasses right away and went out side. They started to get dark, but not dark enough for my liking. (this is personal preference nothing against the company, just trying to help further purchasers) I have extremely sensitive eyes and therefore I need very dark lenses to help seeing when driving/riding my motorcycle. I loved the thought of not having to change glasses on my motorcycle from day to night, however these do not get dark enough. I read some ideas, and then attempted to put these in the freezer overnight and then placed them in direct sunlight. (I have read this helps &#34;activate&#34; them) Nothing has helped with them getting darker. I have a few friends who have the same pair of sunglasses and have shown them the lenses and will be giving them away as they will work for them. There is nothing wrong with this product, it works amazingly and are an awesome set of lenses, if you are in need of a very dark lens though I would look else where. I contacted the company to see if I had done something wrong, and they stated that they are not the darker ones they use to carry. So for the process they work amazing, I could rave on about them for a while, but they just are not dark enough for me."
4.0,"The dress was okay. I wore it for my birthday celebration, but there‚Äôs no tag to know the front from the back and I think I could have made it myself."
4.0,"Fits great,  ordered based on the size chart. As others had said there's not any support in the chest due to thin material but great for just in the bedroom for my husband"
4.0,"They feel cheap. They are cheap. They are polarized. Because they are cheap, you won‚Äôt be concerned about breaking them, and because of that they will never break (karma or something). Unless you grow out of the look, they will last."
4.0,"This dress is almost exactly as pictured, it was just a bit longer towards the knees than in the photo. However, that may be because it was larger than what it was suppose to be on me (119lbs- 5'6- small). Still wore it, was extra comfy!"
4.0,its nice but the background is darker
4.0,"Love this dress! It's sexy, yet very classy. I have a smaller chest so it's not SUPER revealing for me. Wearing it to a wedding, but will be wearing it to other functions and dates. My boyfriend loves it too! Happy I bought this dress!"
4.0,Not really reusable
4.0,all my fault should of bought it a bit bigger for her...
4.0,"It has been added to my hiking pack.  Does what I expect of it.<br />Bear in mind that if you are looking to carry a 40 oz container, you will need a bag with a larger diameter."
4.0,Fast delivery which i love and exactly what i ordered. Fits perfect! thanks Again.
4.0,Little short for being tall. However they are still about 35&#34; inseam.
4.0,"I am just under 5&#34;2 and weigh 195 bought a large and it's snug very snug, the bust is smaller than expected, but overall love the fit and design if this dress it's wonderfully beautiful and elegant, not too heavy of a material. I am also wearing a petticoat, the one suggested when buying it. I gave four stars bc the sizing RUNS SMALL IN THE BUST AREA. Other than that, very happy with my perchase."
4.0,Very nice looking.  Friends noticed it right away.  Just a little hard to put on I thought.
4.0,"Very nice quality, but still even the small size is too big for my wrist. The magnet clasp is strong and I don't worry about losing the watch because of the magnetic clasp but because of sizing issues I only wear infrequently as it tends to loosen up with wear and since it's already a touch too big I don't want my watch to end up falling off my wrist or coming loose and hitting something. I feel like I'm constantly touching or adjusting it to make it tighter"
4.0,Like it lots but hard to close
4.0,This is super cute and trendy. The fit is a little slim but not bad. The applique is not amazing quality the ends of some of it are pulling up and i haven't even worn it other than to try it on. But that should be a really easy diy fix.
4.0,"In the picture provided, it showed that it was a silver necklace. It actually turned out to be golden."
4.0,Fit as expected. Ready to wear this when the weather gets warmer!
4.0,"Looks exactly like it does in The picture. Fits very true to size. My only issue is the fabric is very thin up top and if you are very busty, be careful putting it on bc you might burst a few Seams at the top."
4.0,ADORABLE earrings.  I received the ones that are pictured.  My grand-daughter loved them.
4.0,"In the pic, this cover up looks like it is outlined in grey with the light blue and white.  It is only light blue and white, not darker outlines.  Still pretty for a beach cover up, but it is not what is pictured."
4.0,completely shear.
4.0,I normally wear a size 8 or 10 so I ordered the medium surprisingly the medium is a little large so I may return and try the small. The straps and the fabric are very stretchy and forgiving which is great and I think will allow you to size down. Overall while it doesn't look like an extremely expensive dress it is easily dressed up or down and with the right accessories can be made to look more expensive than it is.
4.0,"Band looks nice , but material  not as flexible as original band .I would have given it 5 stars if not as stiff. Hope it soften with time .Stylish"
4.0,Buena calidad de tela y no transparenta. Talla perfecta. Me encanto
4.0,Want to express my &#34;support&#34; for this SB Sox.  They really give support and I will continue buying additional colors if they should develop.<br />would like to see &#34;skin color&#34; SB Sox.
4.0,"I ordered an xxl based on the reviews but it is too large.  I usually wear a men‚Äôs medium riding jersey or a women‚Äôs medium to large.  I am 58 inches tall and quite muscular and a 36B bra.  This is just too big in the chest area and abdomen.  Length is good and waist just a bit too large.  I will try to alter Jersey using sewing machine to fit me better. Also, neck opening is on the tight side."
4.0,I was looking for a pack to carry water and gear for the archery range and hunting. This pack worked out great. Cloud use one more small pocket instead of the velcro loops but I can work with that.
4.0,They're ok. A little cheaply made.
4.0,"Bought this for my mom, she loves it. Had to alterate it but fit very nice."
4.0,"This shirt runs small. It looks great and is what I was hoping for, but I'm afraid to wash it - afraid it might shrink and then I'd only be able to wear it once."
4.0,Very pretty & feminine
4.0,Was not a oversized as in the picture - may have needed to order a size larger.
4.0,They are exactly as appeared in picture.
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute but a little shorter than expected
4.0,"Well made, good fabric, washes well. Very attractive. Love this brand."
4.0,Fantastic for the price. Wish the waist was tighter elastic tho.
4.0,"I bought these shoes for my son to wear to an outdoor day camp that he attends during the summer. He plays all day outdoors in the dirt, grass, and mud. These shoes are easy to clean up and he is comfortable in them.<br />The fit is as expected. What I like about them is that I can wash them off easily and then they are ready to wear again. They are easy to slip on his feet and run out the door when he wants to play with friends."
4.0,nice but doesn't really protect me from cold air.  I have to have another hat under.  Still I like it as scarf.
4.0,They're great.  I can't wait for fall to wear them.
4.0,"Eh, it looks like the photo but the silver/metal parts like the bands that attach the bracelets to the chain are made of the very cheap thin metal and the SF logo is messy looking. I don‚Äôt know what material it is exactly but it‚Äôs the type that like toys out of those .50 machines are made out of and I‚Äôm betting it won‚Äôt last very long. Upset at the quality as it is a Mother‚Äôs Day gift for my mother in law but the colors are nice."
4.0,Gray looks brown but love this product!
4.0,"The heavy texture is hard on pressure points on toes and bunions, but very nice statement pieces if you don‚Äôt have to wear them all day in heels.  I can‚Äôt speak to oxfords or other shoes."
4.0,"Nice belt with nice buckle.<br />However the leather of the belt itself is super thick. I measured it and it's 3/16"" which is at least 50% thicker than most belts."
4.0,"Much more brushed or matte finish than what the photo suggests, but look good, are comfortable and well priced."
4.0,Not for anyone with neck size over 18
4.0,These glasses feel lightweight and are darker than regular glasses. So... They are pretty good sunglasses.
4.0,"Seems smaller than the measurements on the description.  Other than that, great man purse"
4.0,"Pretty earrings, I can't wait to wear them. You won't go wrong, buy them!!!!"
4.0,"I defy my husband to say he can't find his sweatband!  There are enough that some can be in the laundry, too!"
4.0,"A little too short for someone who is broad across the chest. Very roomy, holds lots."
4.0,"It fits nice on me and it's very pretty but what I got wasn't what the picture was showing, mine has more stones running up the sides instead of just 5 in the center, which made it look a little too big for my nose. Still, I think it's gorgeous and looks nice."
4.0,"cool glasses, 70s motif"
4.0,"Super cute.. can't beat the price and you get 2... mine was a little long and one of the brackets were broken but I easily fixed both problems and wore it under my shirt all day to see how it would do moving around through out the day, if it would break easily but actually held up and will be rocking this with my swimsuit.. super cute and fun.."
4.0,"I liked these pjs but returned them because the small was just a little too snug for me (5' 4&#34;, 113lb). It says 95% cotton but the fabric feels like rayon or bamboo; very silky and soft. They are well made and the trim is pretty. A good deal for the price. The gray is as pictured, a very soothing color."
4.0,The material was low quality but that wasn‚Äôt surprising. It fit pretty well overall.
4.0,"I like the style and the fit of this top (I'm tall, and it's difficult to find tops that are long enough, and I'm middle aged, so it's difficult to find tops that look stylish but don't cling) but beware!! The material is extremely thin and very see-through. I got the ivory color, and it doesn't look like the photo--it's much sheerer, translucent."
4.0,"I really like the style. The fit is okay. I wear a 3 or a 5 usually so I ordered a 4. I'm also really short 5'1 of course they're a bit long on me, but only had to tuck them under 2 inches. I will be wearing them with boots so not too concerned. I like the look of them, however they are not the most comfortable. When putting them on I had the inclination that I needed to be careful in case they ripped pulling them up. And it's not because they're too small, because they're not. It's the material. It is also very hot haha. Will be wearing these in the winter mainly. It says it's mainly cotton, but it doesn't feel that way. With that being said I do like them, just not love them."
4.0,"I was desperately awaiting this dress to come in the mail. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù tall weigh 145 lbs and a bit busty. I bought a size M. It fits just perfect, but if it shrinks when I wash it, it may be slightly snug. A L may have been too roomy! Soft and cool fabric for living in the tropics."
4.0,"good price, decent glasses"
4.0,"I use this visibility vest for running, riding my bike and longboarding specially along busy streets.  The lights on the back makes me more visible to drivers."
4.0,I like the different colors in the earring because I can wear them with more than one outfit and I think they are really pretty.
4.0,a little bent but good thank you
4.0,"Soft comfortable material, shirt fits perfectly. Looks adorable with jeans or shorts. Great purchase."
4.0,The color does not match the green in the picture. Other than that the dress is beautiful and fits perfect.
4.0,"These are very large, which I love and very dark as well! Works great for me out here in sunny NM! Some light creeps in from the side and I am prone to headaches so wearing lenses too long can hurt. Otherwise a great cheap, dark pair of sunnies!"
4.0,I was expecting g what I got. Have not worn it it will be a gift.
4.0,Great Customer Service to fix issue and the dress was as expected.
4.0,I got this and another butterfly ring at the same exact time. This one came about a week after purchase. The other was almost instant. Like 2 days lol.. but this one has lasted longer. I love it. I always cherish my butterfly rings üíú
4.0,Super comfy and super cute. I wear this with my fleece-lined tights and it's a perfect Christmas outfit. The Sweater is surprisingly warm and the lining is very soft. I received a Medium and I think if I were to get a Small then I wouldn't be able to wear tights with it because it would be too short. I don't have any complaints.
4.0,This is very cute on our SUV. One thing ill complain about was the difficulty in removing the air bubbles prior to peeling the backing stick off.
4.0,"Soft, cute and comfy sweatshirt.  I should have bought a size bigger, as they seem to run small.  Buy a size up."
4.0,"These are not totally wool, so they didn't shrink when I washed them. I am not sure they would fit a man's size, as I wear a woman's size 9 shoe and they fit me perfectly. My hubby is a 10.5 and he gave them back to me saying they were small."
4.0,"I loved how this dress fit made to order throughout the torso. The skirt length was conservative and flirty. The print is bold and eye catching. The neckline was a little big for me (I wear a 32 back bra, so I‚Äôm pretty small), as it kept gathering in the front. I solved it by pinching it asymmetrically with a stitch and it looked PERFECT! I could show off my short beaded necklace without any issues.<br />It looked lik the 50s but modern. It felt vintage but with awesome material.<br />I wore it for Christmas Eve dinner because of the colors and it paid off. Get ready for compliments because you‚Äôre gonna get them in this dress."
4.0,its cute and jangley
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and a little overweight. Currently 6 months pregnant. I bought this to wear over my bump (because of length) with a tank to my cousin's wedding.<br />It's absolutely perfect! The ONLY &#34;complaint&#34; I have is that the waist band is VERY tight, but the skirt is also heavy, so it's got to be a little snug for support (plus I'm preggo, that helps) it sits under my chest/over my bump and the Hem falls about 1/2 an inch above the ground (I'm wearing flats) which is exactly what I wanted. No muck, no issue. I imagine it would be properly dusting the floor if I wore it at waist-height."
4.0,"This would be my favorite thing ever if it didn't have so much lint coming off of it. Since washing it has been shedding terribly. I'm not a laundry expert so I'm currently trying to figure out how to remedy this. I don't react well to lint on my face, in my nose and in my eyes. It's super cute and warm though."
4.0,"Love the look and style of heel. Fit true to size for me. The only bad thing is that u can't even walk in them, so I had the heel cut down 1inch. Now I can at least walk to the car."
4.0,Really like this sweatshirt.  Suggest you order up a size as the material (even the band) does not stretch.
4.0,I don't understand all of the reviews saying this sweater looks like it's made for a doll or a kid. The sweater I received looks just like the picture and fits the way it's supposed to. Maybe I received a different one or you all got a bad batch.....That happens a lot with Amazon
4.0,Small for the price.  Fits Pugster bracelet.  Crafted nicely.
4.0,"Measure yourself and follow along with the sizing on this product. I am considered a thin person. I am more pear-shaped. 34B, size 4/6 usually. I am a size S at Target/Old Navy. I ordered a size L. The top is a little big, but doable for sun bathing. I may just buy a cheap bikini top that better fits me later. The bottoms fit great - there's no way I could go smaller. I really like the cut of the bottoms. They are high, even on long torsos. I was really looking for a vintage style that smoothed out my tummy, and this swimsuit did that. I highly recommend this style of swimsuit in general. I have never felt so carefree and sexy. Say goodbye to those tiny little bikinis!<br /><br />I haven't worn it in the water yet, so that's about all the info I have! But seriously, save yourself time later on returns - order one to two sizes up!"
4.0,I ordered the trainer based upon the size guide and returned because it was too small. I ordered per the guidelines as I read a couple of reviews that said true to size. I thought the product was good quality as I need it for exercise and back support. I did return and order the next size up because overall I was pleased with it. It also covers the lower part of the belly well so i like that it was plenty long enough .
4.0,The item arrived in a little over a week. It fit about as I expected being a plus size. I agree the 5x is about equivalent to a US 22. That being said...I don't have a cloth allergy...but I was very itchy even after washing. I wore it for about 4 hours before I was able to take it off and was very glad to do so. It's a cute Halloween shirt but don't think I'll be wearing it except on special occasions.
4.0,"Overall, I am pleased with my new comfortable EyeSnugs.  They block light very well. Comfortable on the face. My only disappointment is the velcro clasp. Perhaps my head is too sensitive but the thickness of the velcro on the back of my head is slightly uncomfortable. I sleep on my back. Other than that the product is very good."
4.0,So cute but runs a tad small and not too stretchy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 120lbs size c bust. I got the smallest option for the olive green
4.0,Cute. Fit as expected. Full coverage with very high side slits but not so high that they show what you don't want them to. Fully covered my bathing suit.
4.0,"It is pretty, however, it is a peachy color more than it is pink."
4.0,Wish top area would have been a little  tighter fit
4.0,"When I took the interior wrapping off of the brown pair, a lense fell out. My husband struggled to put the lense back in but now I'm not sure how secure the lense is.  The sunglasses are beautiful and well polarized.  I'm just concerned about the lense popping out again.<br />UPDATE:  Seller reached out to me a couple of days after my  review.  Seller offered an equitable resolution.  My responses to Seller to accept offer weren't getting to them.  Seller  persisted in attempting to get a response.  Other Sellers would not have continued to work to resolve the issue.  Finally, whatever I was not doing correctly ... my response made it to the Seller üôÉ The BEST customer service I have ever experienced from an Amazon seller!!"
4.0,Very pretty just couldn‚Äôt get it to continually lay properly.
4.0,"I purchased this purse in black, it is exactly as it was decribed & was larger than I had expected it to be. At I first look it looked like real leather there were no unpleasant odor. I would preferred a smaller size purse & more spring color like baby blue, light pink or fuchsia."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, however the chain was hard to hook to the other some after putting the stone on the chainüòë"
4.0,Time and temp to press at were not included inside the box as seller has stated. This is why the 4 stars.  I have also seen several others with the same issues. We should not have to guess on an item such as this.
4.0,So cute! Can't wait to see grandchild in it! Couldn't find the size tag. :(
4.0,"I have been a rayban owner for 40 years. Always thrilled until they sold out to Luxitica. I have tried several times to come back, and was always disappointed; returned each time. Until noe. Finally found some that seem to be of decent quality. Happy for that. Still very disappointed in their customer service and repair service, but I'll give it one more go. Maui Jim may be the wat to go if these fail."
4.0,Fits great! And the girlfriend thinks I look great in it too. Nough for me.
4.0,"Very nice ,they are a little heavy and the stones are tiny."
4.0,Light weight - perfect fit great colors
4.0,"The fabric literally feels like parachute or tent material? Very strange. Breathable, but moisture kind of just rolls right off it... So, on the one hand, if it's hot outside your shirt will be a bit of a greenhouse, but on the positive side you definitely won't get sweat stains and if you get caught out in the rain it might even protect you from the rain a bit! Have to cool iron since it's super synthetic which takes forever and is a bit of a pain, but I love the way the shirt looks and the fit was just as I expected."
4.0,The boxer briefs were received and they fit well. They fee good and are comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that after 1 washing one pair has a small tear in the front.
4.0,They were a gift for my son he liked them.
4.0,"Pay attention to the size chart- daughter wears M, but I bought L and glad I did. It fit very well in bodice.<br />Sleeves and skirt were really long for her (daughter is 5'2), but I was able to trim skirt and take up the sleeves at the bicep area to keep the flowy sleeve design. I hid the seams behind band trimming. Absolutely beautiful renaissance dress when you accessorize with a belt and add band trim around bicep and skirt hem!"
4.0,"these no ride up are good, not the best but are a more economical than others I've bought.  And are great looking.  No seam stitching discomfort at all."
4.0,"I bought this winder about 6 months ago when a different brand I had stopped working in less than a year. This winder was GREAT out of the box and 6 months on it's still VERY GOOD.<br /><br />Out of the box the winder was absolutely silent. I would watch it to see if it was even rotating it was so quiet. A few months later and it's not as quiet but not loud, either. It's very easy to program and looks great. It surpassed my expectations when I opened the box. Compared to others that I looked at, I'd still consider this model the best and am glad I purchased it."
4.0,i am an plus size 18/20 & this skirt is tight in the hip area....have to wear a long shirt w/ skirt
4.0,Sexy. Love the color. Fits like a glove 5‚Äô8 175 and I got a medium
4.0,"Great color, fit well and comfortable."
4.0,Purchased this for my nephew and he absolutely loves it.
4.0,Bought this dress for my Grandaughter.  She loved the dress.
4.0,It's a Christmases present have not opend
4.0,"This is an excellent watch band and the price for what you get is great!  Not sure if it‚Äôs 100% Genuine Leathers, but it fits my needs"
4.0,"I was expecting it to be a thin polyester like many of the dresses on Amazon. It's actually a very stretchy jersey material- cotton polyester blend. I got the pink color and it was accurate to the photo. My sister ordered the navy and her's was made from thin polyester material, so there was a difference for sure in fabric between colors. I'm 5'4 and 150# and I got an L just in case- it was a little long and loose, but appropriate for the wedding event I needed it for. However, I probably would order a M if I were to redo. Cute and comfy dress though, but it doesn't have that stiff flare look that the photos show, it hangs more straight down do to its weight. Not see through at all either."
4.0,Nice wallet. Good looks. A little large. Time will tell how it holds up.
4.0,Good quality but I guess my head was still small for these hats.
4.0,Quality was good but it was a little bigger than other regular medium sized shirts that I have.
4.0,"I‚Äôm flat foot, size 13. Not a wide width. It feels like to me that the middle of the sole has a slight thickness of the center of the sole, which is quite different than what I‚Äôm used to. To me; it‚Äôs a bit annoying, awkward and slightly uncomfortable. However, it maybe something that I might need. Who know for now. I will update as after I walk in it for a longer walk. It looks fantastic and good quality. I‚Äôll let you know later!"
4.0,"The shirt seems to run a bit smaller than junior sizes I've normally purchased and wear, unfortunately. But the shirt itself is awesome, nice soft material, and it arrived much sooner than expected!"
4.0,"fine, i liked"
4.0,"Good fit. I'm tall, slim and it's hard to find a inexpensive pair of pants in my size. Pants are usually too short or too big."
4.0,"This is a cute suit, but ran small on me. I typically wear a 10 in pants or dresses and a medium in tops. I ordered the large and it was too small. Much too small. I ordered an XL in a different color from another vendor and it fit perfectly. I really wanted the black, however, and when I reordered an XL from a third vendor the straps were so insanely long we all had a good laugh. They're cheaply made but good enough for the price. Probably why the sizing is so inconsistent."
4.0,"Very attractive in it's difference. Love the card pockets set up. Slightly larger all around than a standard leather wallet. Corners are very firm and square. So they don't flex at all. Little tricky to get into back pocket. But, I've adjusted."
4.0,"A little tight around the stitching at the ankles where the cuff is attached, but fits well."
4.0,Not much support around the middle (which I look for in a high waist) but I LOVE how they make me feel and how the rest of the legs fit!
4.0,"The fabric seems kind of thin and cheap, we will see how they hold up."
4.0,Nice quality lace and good skirt but was too big for me to pull off.
4.0,Material is a little thin but good looking tanks  also the sizes run a little small
4.0,"super comfortable. My husband bought this for me and i wear it everyday in the morning. feels cosy to sit in and watch a move with a cup of tea, or in the morning!<br /><br />great and a loely xmas present."
4.0,"The good: These are solid boots that have a great steel toed front. Really well crafted down to the strong laces. Very comfortable for a boot and the treads are slip resistant. The not so good: They seem to run a ¬Ω size to big. I had a tough time running the laces thru some of the holes as they weren't aligning. These are quite heavy, not sure that 2.2 lbs is light.  Overall, good solid boots, similar to what the military would issue."
4.0,"It was smaller than it appeared in the picture, but is still a statement necklace. It reminds me of estate pieces---like one of my grandmother's necklaces would have looked. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it, but I've changed my mind! It's very pretty!"
4.0,Great boot. My only complaint is sizing. I normally wear a 7.5 to 8. I purchased the 8 and they are very roomy so I have to wear a very thick sock. I def will be purchasing another pair in a different color because I got so many compliments!
4.0,"There were a few loose threads but even if I only get a few wears out of this, I totally got my money's worth."
4.0,"A little tighter than expected, but the shirt is an elegant touch paired with jeans for a casual dinner out."
4.0,"I purchased a total of 5 sets , the seller did what they could to make me happy when I notified them how small they we're.the four stars are for the effort to satisfy their coustomer."
4.0,This is a great product for anyone who likes there music during the cold winter months.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for after knee surgery.  Something to pad my knee and protect it in and out of my brace.  The only reason these don't get 5 starts is because they smell so badly of some type of grease or fuel that I am unable to wear them until I wash them a couple more times.  Hoping that will take care of the smell.
4.0,"this is a very cute bag that is just big enough to hold all your small items and your wallet + phone. i wouldn't try stuffing it more than that though! the color is also true to life, its a very deep green, but not army green, which i'm happy about. i've had it for a few months now and its still looking new!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:9d758a9c02a5b5f5ffa0f1f71afa6018]] Myobe Sexy Evening Party has a flattering &#34;fit and flare&#34; style! I wear a size 14 and purchased the XXL and it fits, so the dress does run a bit small. The material has a nice sheen to it and I love the deep purple color I chose. The material has 5% Spandex in it, so it does cling to your curves. The length of the dress is very long. I am 5'8&#34; and the dress goes below my ankles. If you are shorter you will need to hem the bottom. The material hasn't &#34;pilled&#34; while washing and the color isn't fading. The stitching looks great and I do not see any loose threads. Thanks for watching! This dress was purchased at a discount in return for this honest review!"
4.0,This is a little heavier than expected. It has a built in liner. Its like a bathing suit. The material and liner feel just like a bathing suit. So hanging and on...its fairly heavy. But its pretty. Exactly as shown. Size is as expected.
4.0,"I ordered this in a small initially and it was way too tight. Like, you could see my belly button kind of tight. I'm 5'6&#34; and 135 pounds. I sent it back and got a medium and it's a perfect fit. The fabric is super soft and the length is great. Only took off a star because the small should have fit based on the sizing in the description. I suppose to be fair, it did fit in the chest, they just need to add a waist dimension."
4.0,Love the fabric. Love the style. Seems to be just a little small for the size. Washes nicely.
4.0,nice soft leather. haven't tested rfid capabilities yet. wished the sleeve would fit the whole passport instead of just the back page but that is just personal preference.
4.0,Cute but definitely go a size up
4.0,very bright pattern.  I should have ordered a medium but other than that a great gift.
4.0,"Nice, but the word 'boot' is misleading and should be taken out of the description.  It's really an ankle bracelet, not what I wanted."
4.0,"Fits a little loose on me (very small wrists), but I gave it to my husband and he loves it!"
4.0,Used once for a wedding and it worked out perfect for the occasion!
4.0,Wish it were a little softer
4.0,Love this outfit on my daughter but it‚Äôs very thin. Not heavy enough for a cold day out.
4.0,"i had these shipped to a relative who has very slender legs.  So, i can't speak for all fits, but she is delighted with them"
4.0,Nice but slips around.
4.0,"Bought these for my family for a movie costume party (Top Gun) and was surprised at how much we all like them for everyday use! While cheap, they are nice and dark, and not uncomfortable. The different finishes make them easy to distinguish whose are whose. They feel more durable than the price would suggest, and they came with two microfiber type pouches for storage. Not bad at all!"
4.0,"The fabric isn't the best but it is a very versatile dress, I ordered the green but the color was quite different, will definitely reorder in another color."
4.0,"Just what I was looking for, inexpensive, multi-color pack, dainty belts. FYI: be careful when removing the belt from the plastic wrapping. The leather loop to hold the end of the belt in place is not attached and will fall off if you aren't careful."
4.0,The dress was much nicer than I expected. However the size ran quite large and I had to return it. Unfortunately the next size down was not available and two sizes down would have been too small.
4.0,This is a nice shirt - bright color - looks great but fits a bit on the smaller side. I would recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Nice assortment for the casual sunglass wearer. Great teen gift.
4.0,"I ordered 4 of these in different colors. Adorable, and very flattering.. The necklace has stood up surprisingly well for the price. Perfect top for work."
4.0,"Good quality for the price, and definitely sexy"
4.0,Just what I was looking for - for my pet
4.0,I love these they are so comfortable and very stretchy. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give them 5 stars is because they ride up sometimes.
4.0,"The fur needs a bit of a trim to look more like the picture, but it's very soft.<br />It's much bigger than I expected, as well. About 5&#34; across."
4.0,"You better order an small one if you're around 1,70 m and 140 pounds"
4.0,An adorable dress. I wear a 34DD so the medium fit well there but was large through the shoulders.  Would definitely recommend this for summer fun dress.
4.0,"Such a beautiful dress!! Fit is a bit small but my real criticism is the height of the slit in the front of the dress. I definitely had to wear spanx underneath to keep from flashing the world, especially when sitting down!<br /><br />I think I will try to put a few stitches in to fix the issue.. or just wear the spanx because I love this dress!"
4.0,Not real gold. Be very careful I lost mine on the first day.
4.0,Not union built
4.0,it is a nice sweater but I need to get it in a larger size
4.0,Great hat!  Comfortable!  Even looks good on me.
4.0,"So cute! I got it as a gift for someone and she loved it. My only complaint is that the coloring is very off; it looms beige/tan in the image, but it is very pink in person. Other than Th t, works perfectly fine."
4.0,"The sunglasses look great and they were shipped with a hard shell case, cleaning cloth, and a screwdriver for lens tightening. I would definitely buy again!"
4.0,"I love my bew slippers, They"
4.0,"Nice fabric, doesn‚Äôt pill as much as other fleece lined ones I‚Äôve had previously."
4.0,"These compression socks feel really good.  I'm not sure if they are made for every day use because I bought them during Christmas time and it's almost March, and I have a hole in one pair and the thread is coming loose in another pair.  I definitely recommend them for conservative use though."
4.0,Very sturdy and they look great!
4.0,"Over priced. These are just ok. If you want any support, you must wear the insert. Sole is not as cushioned as thought would be . Fit is fine. Had hoped for me. They are just ok."
4.0,A really nice coat. Felt Soft and warm and light. Too bad the one that came had a button missing. So had to return it. Credit amazon for a no-fuss easy return system.
4.0,I like the colors they were definitely the shades I wanted them to be. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this Product is that they‚Äôre a little bit plasticky I was cooking in the kitchen and the belt touched the stove and it melted a little bit.
4.0,"fits just as expected and its good material, its the 4th swimming suit I get from here and all are very nice"
4.0,"4 stars only because they fit maybe a little too tightly and cause pain after a couple hours, but I would rather they are too tight and work than not work. I wear them with my earbud headphones or with ear plugs when I‚Äôm studying in a noisy area. They make a huge difference in my study environment and I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Another reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because my body is not a commercial billboard and when I paid for the product, our transaction is finalized. I don‚Äôt have to continue giving to the company with free advertising on my head. I used nail polish remover to erase the giant branding on each ear and then painted over with black nail polish. If you‚Äôre an adult and sensitive to noise then you might also be sensitive to brands, colors, smells, etc.<br /><br />Overall good buy and recommend for students who are sensitive to noise.<br /><br />By the way, they ARE adjustable. Each ear pad can move a bit up and down (along those metal rods) to ensure a good fit. I also feel comfortable laying my head down with them. I think they‚Äôll be especially comfortable on the plane.<br /><br />I think if you have a 21‚Äù circumference  and under head, you‚Äôll probably give them 5 stars. I did notice that they are getting more comfortable with each wear and I wonder if I‚Äôm stretching them a bit? Hope that helps."
4.0,"Cute and roomy, may be cute with a sash and sun hat.  Roomy"
4.0,"This shoe is not my cup of tea but that said this is not a negative review but rather to alert folks that:<br />- the bottom is thin and flat<br />- the shoe lightly but noticeably grips over the top of the arch<br />- the material is interestingly lightweight.<br />If such a shoe design is your thing, you may well like these!"
4.0,"the dress was a great quality and fit really nice, i just decided to go in a different direction for the event i had planned to use this for. loved how it was not see through at all when i ordered it in white"
4.0,Beautiful dress but the slit is very high!
4.0,"Gifts sent out of town, but no complaints!"
4.0,Not meant for phat wrist
4.0,"Everything is great, It even came with a cute bamboo toothbrush. My only complaint is the long one is waaaay too big for my wrist."
4.0,Fits just fine.  Might want more padding but heel is great.
4.0,"These are thicker than I expected which is great! However, the touchscreen fingertips don't work. I had a feeling this would be the case."
4.0,"I recently received Lecxci Men&women style Genuine Leather Zipper Key Chain Holder Case wallet Pouch in the mail.  This would be a great set for someone who has a lot of keys.  As it was, for me, I only have one house key and a smart key for my car.  There is room in the case for a few credit cards.  I also like that there is a place to snap in a key which would be great for my house key.  Honestly, though, for my needs it is a bit of overkill.  I will likely give this to my uncle who owns his own medical practice and has many more keys to keep track of.  It will be great for that.<br /><br />What I like:<br />Leather<br />Zippered<br />Snap key chain inside that can be removed<br />Room for cards and cash<br />Clip to add to purse or belt<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like:<br />Heavy<br />More room for keys than for cards<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall, this is a great solution for someone with more keys than I have.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I was given the opportunity to receive a discount for this item in exchange for my honest testing and review.  I am neither obligated to leave a positive review, nor am I prohibited from leaving a negative one.  I tend to be a ‚Äúglass half full‚Äù person; however, it is also very important to me to be honest.  Because Amazon doesn‚Äôt offer half star options, I sometimes will indicate that, but I will tend to round up.  I work really hard to write thoughtful reviews that will be beneficial to those looking to make informed choices in their purchasing."
4.0,"Liked most 100% cotton.  So hard to find.  Comfort able.  Find large and no apparent shrinking,even when washing in hot water .  But 1 size smaller."
4.0,Beautiful. Arrived on time. But one side has a slightly loose screw
4.0,My son loves his ring . It looks very nice on him.
4.0,"Great looking helmet, eyes won't light up out of the box...apparently.  There are no instructions but if you figure out how to open the switch box inside the helmet, there is a place for 2 x CR 2032 batteries. I guess Im going to purchase some and see if this thing works."
4.0,"Hooks are small and don‚Äôt accommodate all masks, but like that they can hold (some) masks, OR glasses. The price is definitely right. Came in handy to share with my entire office to keep track of our masks and always have them handy."
4.0,"I bought this belt because I hate belts and wanted something flat that wouldn't show through my shirts. I had bought a pair of jeans soon after having my second baby, and because I was impatient, I didn't wait long enough and was still sporting some baby belly. Sooo, the jeans were soon too loose in the waist, but I'm too cheap to just go buy another pair. This belt works great in general, but loses one star because:<br />1: It seems like the spot where I attach it will get gross fast. I haven't had it long and it's already all shredded from where the Velcro attaches.<br />2. The little buckle comes off the belt. I'm afraid I'll lose it every time I take the belt off.<br />Decent, but seems like they could make a slightly better product pretty easily."
4.0,I thought the three layers would separate but it still looks good tho
4.0,"A bit thin, but super comfortable. I get so many compliments on them!"
4.0,"Soft, comfy socks."
4.0,These re actually good little glasses!  They have held up quite well for my six year old and the case comes in pretty handy as well. The green color is exactly as pictured.
4.0,"They are so pretty however, they feel a bit too tight on the ear after about 10 minutes but I will still try to get used to them"
4.0,"Comfortable. Do not put in dryer. Runs small, but I knew this from other reviews and ordered 2 sizes up for looser fit."
4.0,My favorite show and now my favorite hat! Only negative is that the hat itself is a strange fit... it‚Äôs kind of like short on the base of the hat itself so it falls off easily which is a bit of an annoyance.
4.0,"I rely a lot on reviews for quality and sizing. I ordered a small. I am 5'7"" 130lbs and it fit well with a slightly oversized look. The material was very soft and comfortable. I wish it would have looked better on me because it was so snuggly really wanted to keep it, but the bottom hem was just too boxy and not in a good way. I also did not like the way the neck folded over. Its almost like there wasn't enough material, I wanted a fully turtleneck. I am returning."
4.0,Guess I‚Äôm not as big as I thought was too big But the Quality of  the dress was amazing I will be reordering it was Beautiful and well made and the Color was vibrant
4.0,"Really nice leggings, they're very soft inside and I love the high waist! The only downside is some pilling after wash and some sagging in the crotch area."
4.0,"I got a size L, and I'm glad I did because a M would be too small. I like the fit, the length, the color, it's all good. I wish they had pockets but that's not a deal breaker. Some people might think they look like pajama pants but whatever.<br /><br />What I really didn't like was getting a returned item... I mean I get it. I'm not saying put all returned items in a landfill but some quality control would be nice.<br /><br />Whoever had these pants last had some really long brown hair and a dog and they both shed all over these pants.<br /><br />This kind of killed the joy i had about what great pants I initially really liked."
4.0,Fell off my shoes rather quickly.<br /><br />Ate afterwards and the flavor was unbearable.
4.0,good and strong for use
4.0,Adorable dress. I‚Äôm usually between a size small and medium. I went with the small. Fits perfectly. But I am only 5‚Äô2‚Äù. It might be a bit short on someone much taller than I am. I love that the off the shoulder elastic doesn‚Äôt pop back over the shoulder continuously! Great little find!
4.0,"I like it , it‚Äôs all good ."
4.0,"I really like the dress, but it fit really loosely. However, I‚Äôm a little confused, because on the shopping page it just said Women‚Äôs Large, but in the checkout cart & receipt it says Plus size, so I‚Äôm unsure which it‚Äôs supposed to be."
4.0,I just wish that they came in wide width
4.0,"Let me just start by saying that they are very ugly but if you like them that is a personal preference. I got them because they were the closest to flat lenses that I could find. I want to use them for driving and I find that less the lense is curved the less distortion and &#34;weird movement&#34; feeling I get. They are still a little curved, I wish they were perfectly flat but they do the job."
4.0,Very dark lenses and overall a good pair of glasses. They arrived on time and in great shape. Also wasn't expecting to receive two pairs for that price.
4.0,I feel like the length is a bit too short with how much is going on with this necklace but it's very pretty and so different from any other styles. Love it!
4.0,I like the color. ut My daughter the person I got it for lost one side because it did not clip down was a little loose.
4.0,Just what I expected. Fits perfect!
4.0,Nice watch except the galaxy design in the watch face does not have that much of glitters as compared to the one advertised.
4.0,As someone who goes to a lot of concerts and pro sports games this will come in handy if I feel like I need to bring in certain items that won't fit into my pocket.<br />I love the colorful strap also.
4.0,"Nice suit....retro, just what I wanted."
4.0,"Nice ring - my daughter who is really into cats likes it a lot.  The ring is easily sized by squashing it with your fingers, or I guess pulling it open, but it is not cheaply made, and after sizing seems to retain its size.  Nice product for a nice price, and vendor ships quick.  Would recommend."
4.0,"I was very satisfied with these shorts.  My husband is 6'2&#34;, and we have never been able to find shorts that are long enough......these fit the bill perfectly!  They are great looking and he tells me they are very comfortable.  I was going to order a size 38, but after reading several reviews that said they ran small, I ordered a size 40.  He says they are a little too big, but the 38 would have been too small!  We made the right choice with these shorts."
4.0,"I got these for my wife because her socks like to disappear. She has liked them so far. Her only complaints were the texture of the fabric, but she is okay with that. The socks are breathable and have a grip to prevent slippage. For the price, this was a good deal. Good socks."
4.0,"I Liked the purse, but it was smaller than I expected. Quality of the purse was excellent.Very nice purse. Sold it to my friend. She loves it. I would recommend this purse for women who doesn't like a large purse."
4.0,the most liked color and style
4.0,Love it. Bought the matching wallet as well.
4.0,"Size10 womens foot and these are very snug. super cute and cozy, but i wish they were a little bigger"
4.0,Backside was hollow. No features. Perhaps a silicon jell to fill it in or even better have the back as cool as the front.Would pay extra for this feature.
4.0,"I like the different sized bags, perfect for me to bring to work. It‚Äôs not super durable, and I feel like it would rip if I put heavy items in it but you can‚Äôt complain for the price. Worth every penny"
4.0,Im disappointed they are so small love the style since they are to small im giving to my granddaughters they are pretty just wrong size
4.0,Nice dress for the price...
4.0,Nice color and fit. Great value.
4.0,"My 9 year old son loves these under his gear. He says that fit well and don't bunch up. The only caveat is that they are little long. He's tall for his age but still has to roll up the bottoms an inch or so. Thankfully, they still fit snug and he says the rolled up legs at the bottom don't bother him at all."
4.0,It comes with a cute bracelet of the same metal color. It looks nice and cute with jeans or dress up!
4.0,Watch band fits perfect. No issues replacing and the color matches exact. I would have given it 5 stars if the band was just a little bit more flexible. I feel like the rubber could be just a bit softer like my other G-Shocks. Other than that I would recommend this.
4.0,these were good but mine only came with 23 :(
4.0,Like the look.  Elegant.  Back Zipper keeps moving to the side.
4.0,"I've been having more and more trouble with achy hands in the winter and they seem to be getting worse with bad circulation, etc. But you can't type with gloves on and my work takes a lot of time on the keyboard. These gloves are perfect and fit me well. I have small hands and they are as if they were made for me.  A lot of buyers seem to be griping about threads pulling, etc. Since these are partially polyester or something, I simply took my trusty lighter and burned all the ends of the finger holes lightly and any pulled threads were reduced to little melted balls of poly which I quickly mashed into the pile.  A tailor's trick for socks and works very well on these gloves, no more pulled threads or frayed ends. (Remember to just melt the outside edges, the inside needs to stay soft.)"
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised with this dress. I wasn't expecting it to be as long as it is. This makes me very happy since I'm 6' tall and dresses rarely touch the floor way for me! I actually have to lift this once as I go up stairs. One thing I don't like is that you can see the pockets through the dress. Also you can't wear a normal strapless bra because ur will show on the sides. Besides thar I love this dress. It's loose but still looks nice. I'd recommend it if you're tall like me!
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings! They are the perfect size too! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the posts are thick and it was a little painful when I wore them because my earring holes are small, so they were getting stretched out from the thick posts. I‚Äôm keeping them and hopefully I‚Äôll get used to wearing them because they are so pretty!‚ô•Ô∏è"
4.0,I didn‚Äôt like the length it was too long but it did fit well enough
4.0,Fits as expected but material is very heavy
4.0,"going out of Town in a couple of days and pack up all my toiletries, this bag is perfect....Both sides have room for odds and ends you always have to have with you and the middle compartment is big enough for all my stuff....I was amazed how well everything fit....It looks really small and I had my doubts that everything would fit in it...but it did!!!! For that alone I love this....now I just stick it in my suitcase and I'm ready to go!!<br />Very nicely made and the has nice heavy duty zippers, which if your a over packer (like me) is always a bonus"
4.0,"thinner than I would like, but fair for the price.  have not washed yet- will do in cold and hang dry."
4.0,This was very pretty and it fit well but my wife wanted an outfit with a little warmer material so it was returned
4.0,"Protects well so far.  I'm worried about scrapes, so we'll see how it works for scrapes.  My boots are already waterproof, so this was to protect them from scrapes.  I gave four stars because I feel like they should have been more clear on the labeling that it will darken the nubuck on your Timberlands.  It's ok, still looks good, but I really liked the previous color more.  In the products defense, it does say that it may darken nubuck, but I missed it as I skimmed the directions (oops!).  So, maybe I should have given five stars, but be aware, it WILL darken nubuck."
4.0,Perfect size squares!
4.0,These were a great value for my money! They fit well and are well made and are very comfortable. They do run small. I ordered an 2x and I‚Äôm a 38 D and it‚Äôs right.
4.0,"Compared to other compression stockings that I own and wear, these are comparable from a comfort standpoint from the heel up.  I do feel that they probably have a much more consistent compression rate across the full length of the stocking as I find them much tighter and more difficult to put on over my foot which is wider that average.  They are, however, too long.  I am not short (nearly 6-foot) and none of my other stockings (6 different brands) require me to roll down the top of the stocking by more than an inch.  Will have to wait and see how they wear although they appear to be well made."
4.0,Great look...loved it.
4.0,"I love these glasses.  They are super cute, came in a nice case, a sense cleaning rag, and a guitar pic.  I hope they last."
4.0,"The pockets are a bit bulgy in the back, but overall the material is fine and the ankles taper nicely."
4.0,Both products as heat quality. The skirt runs big and the sweater fits fine.
4.0,"They are warm and comfortable.  Removed one star because the touch function doesn't work perfectly, but on the whole I'm very happy with them."
4.0,"For the price, nice too tunic.  Fits and drapes well.  The hemline does cut up (shirt tail?) on the sides, which did not suit me.  Otherwise a terrific value."
4.0,Very comfy.  I ordered wine and they are basically chocolate color.  But I would order again in another color.
4.0,Super cute outfit different o my downfall is the suspender clip broke after one use
4.0,I made this purchase as a gift for my daughter. She loves them. The quality of the earrings are good but my daughter says they pinch her ears after a while. Overall a good purchase.
4.0,"The jacket runs a lit small. Even though it's not for me...which I wear large size, this is 3x and fits me okay,  not too tight, not too lose.<br />The design is nice as well the fabric..I like it."
4.0,"The coat is very warm and I love how it fits. I do have 2 things I don‚Äôt like about this coat: first, the sleeves could be a bit longer. The cuff is longer than the sleeve. Second is the color. I ordered Fog, which should be a gray color. It is 100% army green, even the zipper is green, which in the title is supposed to be polished gun metal color."
4.0,"Neat, love the material, fits perfectly."
4.0,Got this product really quick. Very shiny and the perfect size for my son. He's gonna love it when he gets it on Christmas!
4.0,Fruit o the Loom is always goog
4.0,It is good product with correct fitting. It keeps warm and does not overheat. Overall a good product
4.0,"Get a size or two larger if possible, one size larger is tight on me!"
4.0,"Really cute,  great color,  holds up after one wash.  Unfortunately, sleeves are a little short, they ride up over wrist area. Pants are a little short, but still cute with the right sneakers. 5'9"" 180lbs"
4.0,They're a little too small but  other than that they're really cute!
4.0,"Wore it for the first time yesterday and received many compliments. I like it a lot, looks very elegant. The only thing is that I ordered a small but it was still a bit loose on me. I'm 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs. The sleeves were ok but the body of the shirt was a bit floppy. I like to wear clothes that are snug. But overall not bad and pretty good in terms of quality. Will see how long it lasts after washings."
4.0,"Talla, perfecta!! Mi ni√±o tiene 6 a√±os.. size 5/6 en USA ped√≠ en talla 120<br />Colores vivos, les encaro a todosss... lo √∫nico q no me gusto mucho, fue el material, 100% lycra!! Pero bueno, era solo para su fiesta de CUMPLEA√ëOS!!"
4.0,I like Lapis jewelry The Blue Stone Matches My Lapis Necklace
4.0,Decent replica of designer brand that costs $500.
4.0,"Quality is all right. Cute color that yellow! I‚Äôm a 34B, athletic build, 5‚Äô5, and the medium fit me perfectly. I usually wear a small in shirts and a size 4-6 in everything else."
4.0,Bonito pero muy peque√±o.
4.0,Nice looking and Elegant
4.0,The wallet does what I need it to do. Seems to be about 1inch too large for no real reason. If it was a bit smaller I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,Good quality shirt for the price. Very soft material. Would buy in other colors if they were available.
4.0,The fabric was a bit thicker (and warmer) than pants I usually wear for Zumba - OK for  cold weather but I think it would be too warm for not weather.
4.0,I loved the material on this dress the most! I feel it runs on the larger size (normally wear L/XL and I believe I got this in XL and could have worn a medium and been fine!) I am 5‚Äô4 and the back stopped about mid calf. The tie added a nice touch. The button never came undone and the straps are adjustable! Will wear again!!
4.0,"My daughter (who is 9 years old) believes she is a gorilla.  So, even though these slippers were a little bit too big, she loves them very much.  It allows her to pretend a little bit better."
4.0,Nice and on time.
4.0,"Originally bought them in pink and loved them.  Yes, they're a little tight but stretched a bit and are no longer feeling like I might get a blister on my Achilles tendon.  They don't appear to be the type of shoe that will last for more than one season but for the price, I still think it's worth it.  I liked them enough to buy them in navy & red as well.  Good flats to commute to/from work."
4.0,Definitely order one size up. Material and stitching are on par with more expensive shorts. Product stays well on leg without riding up or binding. Seems to be a decent pair of underwear and a great value.
4.0,excelente me gustaron y llegaron en perfecto estado llegaron con caja y todo no me quejo fue lo que esperaba
4.0,"It‚Äôs nice , worth the money ,, I recommend this seller"
4.0,Small but I knew that based on other comments when purchased! Really cute though!
4.0,SO FAR SO GOOD....I REALLY LIKE MY WATCH
4.0,"I really liked it and I thought it was fly, but everyone insisted that it was a girl's mask. So if you are confident and strong, you will be able to pull it off and look beautiful doing so, but if you're not then you should look elsewhere for a masculine mask."
4.0,"Does the job quickly and effectively. Just be gentle and make sure pin is alligned with bracelet link, press and bingo, pin is removed. I have already sized two stainless linked watches of multiple sizes. They give two spare pins which the other competitors dont."
4.0,"A little tricky to get fitted but once you do, these are great!  They stay on perfectly and not uncomfortable."
4.0,It is so cute! Wish it fit my body however I wasn‚Äôt able to zip it up. The chest area was too small. Bought a small and my shoulder and chest didn‚Äôt fit. Had to return.
4.0,My daughter wore them to her prom as an alternative to uncomfortable shoes! Got lots of compliments!
4.0,"Makes my (almost) daily 4-6 mile walks enjoyable. Good (enough) sound quality, easy to use, easy to charge, which is a good thing, but 3 hours is about the most I can get from a charge. I'm just recharging after every other walk now. Plenty warm enough."
4.0,Love that the zipper goes so far up. Makes it so much easier to get little hands in.
4.0,"I received this item vacuum sealed and was expecting an over abundance of manufacturing smell and shedding, I was surprised to see almost no shedding occurred upon opening and the smell was very faint. I tried it on and am happy with the fit, and it's very warm. I minused one star because the Sherpa material isn't as thick as it should be and you can see the foundation through it and it should be fully covered. Other than that I have no complaints thus far, I won't be wearing it in public but this will be the house norm."
4.0,I give it four bz I'm not a big fan of how it feels but I love it
4.0,I like the hat although the material is a little thin. However I'm very please with it. The scrambled eggs is a nice touch.
4.0,"I loved the shoes, they were so cute! But my granddaughter was not able to wear them on her trip to Disney because they were too big! :("
4.0,I would have given this purse a five star because I absolutely love it and have been using it since I bought it at the beginning of June but the magnetic button on the front is about to come off and I had to stop using it because the shoulder strap where it meets the purse is coming unstitched. But aside from those 2 flaws I love it.
4.0,"I like it, when I got it, it smelled really strong, kind of like paint, for several weeks"
4.0,"I loved the way it fit everywhere but my chest area. I am naturally large busted and it doesn't fit comfortably around my boobs,  I also wish it had snaps in the crotch area to make it easier to use the restroom."
4.0,Got this for my son as a gift. It's a better quality than I thought and he was very happy with it... long enough for his liking too!
4.0,"It's a great looking skirt! I also sewed it together in the middle as other reviewers, the buttons will definitely go loose at the minimum movement"
4.0,"These are fun and small, but the magnets provided were too weak. I just got a stronger magnet so I can wear these. I wear on my ear, my lip, my nose. So fun without the permanence. The color variety is great too! You will need a stronger magnet or two though to use them."
4.0,"I purchased this jewelry to replace my current one that I had lost one of the balls. It was internally threaded, so I instantly bought it. The only downside was that the balls on this one was smaller than what I was wearing already, so I tried replacing the whole jewelry with this one. It was crazy small from my original one and it was hard to screw on the balls into the sockets. Ended up using another jewelry that I purchased off of Amazon. If you like small septum jewelry, I would recommend this one!"
4.0,Nice. Fit it perfect
4.0,"It‚Äôs a cute shirt but didn‚Äôt fit like I had hoped. Didn‚Äôt think it would be that clingy, more loose is what I wanted."
4.0,It's absolutely beautiful!! Will definitely buy the dress again in different color :)
4.0,"I used this wallet for over a year and loved it. It is definitely the thinnest and lightest wallet you can get. It might not look as good as leather, but it does not matter much to me. It definitely wears out faster than a leather wallet, though. Mine started to have holes in it after about a year or so. I was somewhat unhappy about it and decided to try Gem Avenue MW30070 leather wallet instead. It is supposed to be very small, as least as far as the leather wallets go, and has excellent reviews. Well, after getting it, I miss my ALL-ETT. The Gen Avenue wallet is much thicker when it is empty than my old ALL-ETT with all my cards and cash in it. I'll see if I get used to it, but I might go back to ALL-ETT even knowing that I might need to replace it every year.<br /><br />The size is obviously the #1 reason to get this wallet. I also like it that you can put cash in it like in a regular wallet and you don't have to fold it like in may smaller wallets and card holders. The negative is that you only get two pockets for the cards. I put four cards that I typically use at the top and bottom of each pocket since it is easier to get them out that way. Other cards go in between them, but it is not as easy to get them out, so it is not ideal if you need to use a lot of cards frequently."
4.0,"nice fit on my hands, soft leather gloves"
4.0,"The quality was good, just too small for my 8 year old."
4.0,pretty looking earrings. Fell off as the clasp is not tight
4.0,Weirdly tight waistband.
4.0,Pretty for my granddaughter.
4.0,"Colors are vibrant and the product looks similar to the photo. My only complaint is that they should package the earrings differently as the packaging it came in was super tight, therefore smashing the earrings and now they‚Äôre not hanging correctly. May take some shaking to get them to be loose."
4.0,"Beautiful but very thin , product shows as a jacket, it can't keep you warm. It's more like a very thin shirt with a zipper."
4.0,"I now own 2 in different colors, they‚Äôve become my favorites!!"
4.0,Love this swimsuit. It fits perfectly but I did have to fix the zipper twice since washing it. But that little defect I wouldn't stray away from ordering it again. Order a size up
4.0,I love love LOVE this corset!! The skirt is kinda low quality but that‚Äôs okay!!
4.0,This wallet has been good but not perfect. The strap wears out but its mainly a cosmetic part of the wallet. I cut off the strap and its not a problem. The pockets that hold the credit cards are tall meaning that your cards are totally enclosed in their pockets. This is great until you try to pull out your cards... it makes it touch to pull them out.<br /><br />I have no doubt that this wallet will last forever. So far I have been pleased with it!
4.0,Fits my long fingers well. 94 percent cotton and 6 percent spandex. Inside of fingers has a slightly raised area to provide more purchase when driving. Will not work for using cell phones.
4.0,Looks ok but a bit short in size
4.0,These are great but do seem to show wear.
4.0,Comfy. Good value.
4.0,I have been wearing my belly ring since receiving it and I love that it is so comfortable and does not get caught on my clothes.  The only problem that I have with this ring is that the balls do not align right but other than that absolutely love this jewelry.  Will definitely be purchasing from this company in the future.
4.0,This was a Christmas gift. The recipient loved it.
4.0,My daughter loves them. She wants to  wear  them all the time.
4.0,"I wanted a sporty look in a female hat but they only had one in a man's hat, and i wanted white, so i bought the smallest men's size.  it works fine, but i just wish there was a little more coverage around the side of the face more.  but i knew what i was ordered and i got exactly what i ordered.  i'm fine with it."
4.0,comfort and easy to put on
4.0,"Everything is yellow!  Everyone's windshield is yellow, but that's okay!  I'm enjoying these glasses so far.  They aren't like regular Polorized sunglasses.  But during rain, everything does look sunny!  These glasses also don't' block out my cell phone screen like others do, so if I am getting a call I can see who is calling/texting so I can answer (not while driving of course)."
4.0,Usedsize chart but way too tight.
4.0,"Overall, this is a great sweater and worth the price.  I'm 5'10&#34; and 210 pounds, and the XL size fits me pretty well.  The reason why I took off one star is that the sleeves are unusually long.  I folded them over once at the ends and they were still too long and bunching up a bit around my elbows."
4.0,Love the smaller 2 (plain ring n 3 stone) the full stone one is beautiful but to big for my taste. If just doesn't suit me face.
4.0,"Very pretty, can't wear it everyday as the stones cut into the side of the finger next to it."
4.0,"The fit of the gloves were great, have yet to try them in the sevier cold"
4.0,"I love the bath towel wrapüòâ, however the shipper spared no expense by placing the label directly on the plastic covering that the item came in and mailing the item. No privacy an open for anyone to see or steal."
4.0,"Super flattering dress, the skirt material is a bit stiff, but I'll make it work"
4.0,"It‚Äôs def a bit thin and see through but, I wear shape wear under garments and it worked beautifully with my outfit!"
4.0,These earrings came in and I was expecting them to be cheaply made just because it isn't real jewelry. I was pleased to see that they are really good quality and came in great packaging! They are definitely worth the money!
4.0,"Girlfriend purchased: I don't want to post this as a negative because I absolutely love this and will for sure wear the heck out of it, I just wish it was a little longer than it is. Other than the length it is 100% as shown in the picture."
4.0,"This sweater dress fits very well. The pockets are usable size and not ""fake"" ones. Looks great with thigh high socks or boots. The cuffs on the wrists are a good 7 inches deep though. Not an appealing look, but my sleeves will not be dipped in a meal accidentally. :) overal nice comfy fit."
4.0,Good thickness but creep up a little when wearing.
4.0,My seven year old loves this and lives in it! It‚Äôs thin enough to not be too hot but keeps her warm. Some of the seams popped loose and I had to sew them back together. Minor inconvenience. She loves it so much it‚Äôs worth it!
4.0,"I recently purchased these in 5 or 6 colors and like them all.  They are very lightweight which is important to me as I am generally pretty warm-natured.  Down here in Texas it does not get cold very often and even when it does you can bet whoever owns the building has the thermostat cranked way up.  For me it was just about other options to break up my boring corporate office button down shirt + slacks routine.  Using these I can mix up the look without fear of  feeling like a roast in a crockpot.<br /><br />Pros: Lightweight, buttoned (don't like the zipper look), Not ornate (can be paired with pretty much anything)<br />Cons: Price is a bit high considering they are more decorative than functional, no pockets"
4.0,"Very cute and flowy, size up if you‚Äôre taller and/or have a larger bust"
4.0,Well made but arch too high for me?
4.0,Love the price and quality of this item.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the button is difficult to do alone.
4.0,"Not as cavernous of a fit as I was expecting, but a good robe. I love how warm and soft it is, and the fact that it has both pockets and a hood."
4.0,"My daughter is very petite. She wears about a size 2. This looks adorable on her, and fortunately is adjustable in the back. Pulled in tightly, though, it is still a bit saggy. It is a heavier material than it appears and, because it is slip on, tends to droop. All in all, though, she likes it and so do I."
4.0,You are able to order a down size.
4.0,We needed some links taken out but no company is willing to &#34;risk&#34; taking them out.
4.0,"Cute dress, but under the arm there is a weird patch of yellow fabric, almost like the image was misprinted and/or stitching was off. Otherwise, it was very cute for meeting Elsa at Disney."
4.0,"love the material and colour just brilliant, fit perfect"
4.0,"Heavy matetial. Definitely a winter dress, but beautiful."
4.0,Lovely shirt but it runs small
4.0,"Fit was great all around except the sleeves where a bit tight at the end seems. I delt with it, its wasnt noticable, but uncomfortable for me.  It looked gorgeous though. I was very pleased with the overall quality of the material. I thought I looked decently classy in it.  Just beware if you have muscle or thicker than average arms.  The chest and waist fit just right, just the sleeves where an annoyance with the tightness there."
4.0,They are just as pictured but sizing was off some.
4.0,"Waist fits as expected. Pouch is small and fits very snug, Going up a size might fit better in the pouch but the waist will be sloppy. Would love to see this in Ice Silk."
4.0,Cute. Thinner material than expected.
4.0,Super cute. Was able to adjust to fit easily. I do have a little trouble seeing the numbers.
4.0,"I do like this top.  However, the top snap broke only trying it on.  The front length is short though.  I normally wear XL in tops b/c I'm 40DD and a little broad.  So fit somewhite tight to be worn as mini but ok with tights and boots.  Sleeves pergect length, material has soft/silky feel.  But adjustment needed for comfort and room in breast V-area.  Not bad, but if 40DD or larger, consider next size up."
4.0,Beautiful color and fit. The material is not heavy and has some stretch to it. Very comfortable.<br />The only negative that i have is that the stiching does not seem to be the strongest.<br />I wear a size 16 and ordered this in an xl.
4.0,"Fabric doesn‚Äôt look the same as the picture, looks a little cheaper in real life. But overall the dress is nice."
4.0,"Great. Work well keeping you warm, keep their shape well."
4.0,"First time putting it on I could hear some of the threads break, but it hasn't affected the function of the bra. It is very comfortable and the wide band keeps everything in place. It takes a little patience getting the molded cups in the right place so you don't look lopsided and I appreciate that they are removable, but overall they are great, especially for the price!"
4.0,"Very nice for female with smaller wrist. Wish it came in more colors such as brown, tan, orange, teal, etc.."
4.0,Weird but cute
4.0,"I was looking for a modest bathing suit where I wouldn't need to be tugging here or there when I get out of the water. This suit is fantastic for coverage, whether you want that coverage for sun protection or for modesty's sake.<br /><br />The only thing lacking -- and it's kind of a big deal for me -- is that there is no support. SOME kind of tummy control would go a long way, given the design of the suit.<br /><br />For reference, I am a medium based on the sizing chart lists, and that is the correct size for me. But after multiple pregnancies, I wouldn't mind a slight bit of help in the stomach area, lol.<br /><br />The fabric design with the curved lines are flattering though.<br /><br />Thicker fabric or a bit of tummy control, and this suit would be 5 stars."
4.0,Great necklace for the price. I've worn it a half dozen times so far... Even accidently went through the washer! Perfect if you have little ones that love to wear your necklaces but you don't want to worry about them damaging an expensive necklace :)
4.0,This is cute skirt and I love the pockets. The size small's waist is a bit loose for my 26''. It also has a skort underneath. This means I can't wear it as high waisted as I'd like and it looks slightly long (I'm 5'4). Overall a good purchase though.
4.0,Super cute and cheaper than buying at a boutique.
4.0,Product is good üëçüèª
4.0,These are the correct earrings for tanjiro according to the manga and anime please don‚Äôt get the other brands with the rising sun motif as it has caused a lot of issues for cosplayers
4.0,"Personally, I haven't seen a belt like this in retail stores. Perhaps it's only because I go to stores like Target, Walmart, and Ross, but it's good to see that these new type of clothing items are entering the market here on Amazon.<br /><br />This is genuinely a ""luxury"" type of good, and that's mainly because the design is rather elegant. the carbon fiber design is really fitting and discreet for suits and formal events. I find that this will be an excellent belt for prom.<br /><br />I really like the adjustment system on this because it doesn't utilize holes, but rather a track system. It's easy to use, and it's much more comfortable.<br /><br />Overall I do recommend this belt."
4.0,Ok quality but has lots of room. The color is rather dull. But this is the style my teenager wanted with the nice cross-body strap.
4.0,"The top fit appropriately but the shorts were a bit tight, the elastic isn‚Äôt very wide so it cuts in a little. The material is super soft and the colors very vibrant."
4.0,"Very comfy, fits well, love the color - its a good casual shirt. I am concerned that the material may get worn out a little sooner than I hope, but I will enjoy it while it lasts."
4.0,Loved these and they look exactly as they are advertised. The only issue is that one of the links was very weak and part of the chain of one broke off and it's now unusable. So far the others are great and cute!
4.0,I bought this for my husband since his money clip was wearing out.  He seems to really like this.  Its not thick like a wallet to be bulky in your pants.<br />He likes it
4.0,Thanks a lot! Received my jacket last week. I‚Äôm very happy with the quality and design.  It was above my expectations. I‚ÄôIl buy more  from you. Well done.
4.0,Big...too big.<br />Gets bigger as you wear it.<br />The colors are oddly different than what they look like on the screen<br />The shirt is really well-made. I had to send them back<br />twice just to get me the right size.<br />It didn't shrink its not a feminine cut.<br />its really boxy and frumpy.<br />There are side tabs and buttons that button up like the sleeves
4.0,Looks great on my daughters
4.0,"Cute dress and fits good. The only complaint I have is near each pocket, there are two little pink ink dots. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs how they marked where they‚Äôre going to sew the pockets. Luckily it‚Äôs not too noticeable, but just knowing it‚Äôs there is annoying."
4.0,The crotch is very long
4.0,"My only complaint is that the watch is so large. I guess you can remove some of the links, but that's an inconvenience. The average woman's wrist is not that big so idk why they made the watch that big. The watch is very pretty, but I gave it away because it was too large to fit my wrist."
4.0,I really like the cups in the top. Your nipples don't show. I'm a size 16 pant and XL top and i bought a 2xl.
4.0,"Would be perfect if the dress was tighter around the waist. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weigh 134 pounds. Length was nice, material was okay. But it worked well for my cosplay."
4.0,"Always comfortable and a perfect fit. Nice color, too"
4.0,great wallet for the price. have had it almost a year. still in great shape. i love the dividers
4.0,"It is a nice cover up, with bonus pockets, which is what I was looking for.  It has an open neck, which is good.  My only complaint is that it is not totally open in the front, which is not a big deal, but it wrinkles terribly.  Other than that, it is a nice material that is very light and airy.  And honestly, on the beach, who cares if it is wrinkled. LOL!"
4.0,"Some of them were broken, but majority of them held up really well and worked with necklace chaints by sliding the chain through the megaphone handle bar on the charm."
4.0,Great band. I like the rubber better when I‚Äôm in the water but this is a great band.
4.0,This was a good quality costume.  The wings especially.
4.0,Beautiful but not gaudy
4.0,I like the cotton/poly blend. Very cozy. Great color. Long enough to cover me belly.
4.0,Very nice for the price.  I love the Hunger Games and the Mockingjay charm and arrow are cool.
4.0,"The print on this tie is absolutely adorable! It's bright, fun, and whimsical. I'm guessing if you're ordering a $12 unicorn tie, you're not expecting the quality of the finest silk, but it's worth saying that the quality is that of a $12 unicorn tie. The fabric is kind of thick and bulky, but it still ties smoothly enough to look good for what it is.<br /><br />This is a great way to add a dash of fun or whimsy to an outfit when needed."
4.0,"I recently bought a bunch of Soma bras with band sizes 34 and 36 and quickly realized that I needed to either exchange the ones that were 34 band sizes for 36, or just buy some bra extenders. These were perfect, so if you need to extend your bra just a bit, these will work.<br /><br />I appreciate that there were six extenders in the pack I purchased. They do fall off of my bras when I am unclasping, but I think that if you use pliers, you can permanently attach them to the bra. The hooks on these extenders are circular, so they did not match the more D shape of my soma bras, but this is not a big deal; they still do their job. Obviously, by extending the bra, the hooks/clasps you need to use will no longer fall at the center of your back, so this will make putting on bras more annoying at first.<br /><br />Again, I will emphasize that you MUST measure the distance between the hooks on your bra before purchasing bra extenders. Most bras sold on Amazon are spaced 3/4 inch apart. I knew that I needed my bra extenders to have hooks spaced 1/2 inch apart, so I knew which pack I needed."
4.0,Beautiful it fits and I'm able to display my gay pride
4.0,Loved but smaller than they looked.
4.0,"Great, but sometimes the straps in back slide out of the hook closure."
4.0,"looks so cute like picture, length is good, came SUPER fast/early, the only reason that this isnt a 5 is the bust doesnt fit me i ordered an XL anticipating this problem, but it was too small :("
4.0,"I use this bag for my fitness classes. It‚Äôs a great bag that accommodates my thick workout mat as well as my headphones and various workout items, but it‚Äôs also lightweight and easy to carry."
4.0,"I really like these shorts.  They fit my waist really well and stay put.  They are super comfortable.  These are a little tight in the banding around the legs.  They stretch and pull down and are fine, but when they run up a little they get a little tighter."
4.0,"Great bag, however the leather is a bit shinier than it looks in the photos. Otherwise everything else is the same."
4.0,Just as described. Great gift.
4.0,"These are cute and fit great.  The material is much better than I thought, feels good. Squat Proof ‚úîÔ∏è! üí™üèΩüî•!"
4.0,Quality matches price. Fit well. Haven‚Äôt gotten it wet yet so hoping top or bottom isn‚Äôt see threw....I‚Äôll update if it is. Only complaint is the bottoms are really bright. Like a fluorescent pink. My daughter doesn‚Äôt like it and probably won‚Äôt wear it but she had blue bottoms that go with another bathing suit that matches perfectly.
4.0,Doesn't set well on my head/ cover my ears. Still hurts my ears :(
4.0,"Ordered for my wife who is on contract across country. On my recent visit I used it and this piece is tight, well made, versatile and completely utilitarian. The handkle height when in cart mode is a bit low, but then so is my wife!! lol / shes a short person so hey it works GREAT for her but also for me so no worries there. Price point for value is a solid 10."
4.0,"After reading a few reviews stating that people ordered larger than their normal size only to receive a dress too small to fit, i did the same thing and ordered a dress two sizes too large to be safe (I am a seamstress and can take the dress in if need be, so I regularly do this with clothing where the sizing is unsure). The dress arrived just Friday and is amazing quality! The fabric is all very thick and heavy and all around feels like a very durable dress. The only problem is that it is just a bit too large on me. I ordered a large when I am normally a Small/Medium, but I should have ordered the Medium. I can take the dress down a couple of sizes easily enough, so it is alright.<br />I would still say to order a couple of sizes larger than normal just to be safe and be ready to take it to a tailor if you are unable to take it in yourself if you get this dress, but honestly for the price of this dress? A downsizing fee at the tailor isn't that big of a price to pay. This dress could have and should have easily been significantly more expensive with the quality of it, so overall I am very pleased.<br /><br />4/5 stars only because of the sizing issue and the inconvenience of having to size it myself."
4.0,Very nice. Lightweight and feminine. They look exactly like the picture.
4.0,"Nice necklace, as described"
4.0,"I love the way the material feel and the way it fits. Although, I had to return it for a larger size, I love it."
4.0,fades after long pool use.  still holds together and fits well though
4.0,"The color I chose , blue, is very attractive. It is very comfortable however it has a lot of wrinkles so a trip to the dry cleaner may be needed."
4.0,"I got a white in a size small and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a tad big.<br />White is not bleached white color, more like a bit cream/ivory white.<br />I love the top wearing with leggings but I wish the armhole was a bit smaller. Armhole are big and my bra peak a bit....<br />Other than that, I think it‚Äôs great comfortable shirt!<br />I don‚Äôt mind the center line people are talking about at all."
4.0,It's unique but the chain is very delicate!
4.0,Super cute hat for the money. Came a little  bent in the packaging.
4.0,Over all it is a nice set and will fit for Christmas photos. But I am afraid of washing and drying it because I'm pretty sure it won't fit again. I read it runs small but I'd say two sizes smaller. My son normally wears 3T pants. I got this in a 4T and it fits like it's barely a 3T. For a comparison you can use the photo I've posted as a size reference. The peach and gray colored pants on  the left are Carter's brand 3T. This product is on the right in 4T. Definitely order two sizes up.
4.0,"Fun dress. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. However, I'm well over 60 years young & not my usual style"
4.0,Great product quality
4.0,"VERY PRETTY Dress, but it runs very small. I wear a size  woman  16 with a bra size 42 c and I ordered a size 18 or xxl and it was too small in the bust. I sent it back."
4.0,These aprons are great. They are heavy duty and they cube clean very easily
4.0,there‚Äôs more side boob then expected but it‚Äôs really a great suit!
4.0,"Not quite long enough for my daughter's shoes, but we can still use them anyway. Makes it easy to get her shoes on and off and they are still tight enough they don't fall off her feet."
4.0,Fit is great and patterns is very cool
4.0,Was just as pretty as it was in the picture.  Fit very well.
4.0,This suit did fit as expected except that the front is cut VERY low
4.0,"It's a great basic tee shirt. The material isn't super soft, but the color and material looks nice. I love that it's a little longer but not super long like a tunic. I'm 5'3 and 125 pounds, and I bought a small. I'd probably buy a size up next time."
4.0,a little snug and i ordered a size bigger than usual but still like it
4.0,pretty .. as listed.. but a little bigger than i thought -- my fault
4.0,I like the shirt and the fit. Things kind of stick to the material. Overall great shirt for the price.
4.0,"These are HEAVY on my ears. BUT, I have a lot of dark hair, so it‚Äôs hard to find earrings that show and don‚Äôt get lost in my hair, and these are a great size. Just wish they were lighter."
4.0,"Shirt arrived on time and I was Happy! I ordered it for my husband's Birthday. When He received it, He was elated! Thank you!"
4.0,"Order came promptly and was everything I expected.  Dress fits well, fabric good quality."
4.0,I really like this shirt. It's cute and fits great. The material is soft and comfortable.
4.0,Well made but runs a size small.
4.0,"You can tell by the picture that the wings aren't attached to the snitch. If you want a &#34;true&#34; golden snitch this isn't it, but it is a great alternative. Heavy, seems to be well built for a china product. I got lots of compliments on it and my kids always try to steal it. Did not receive extra batteries but I'm not sure how I'd change them anyway. Worth the price."
4.0,"Wow, amazing dress if there isn't a flaw on your butt..üòÇ"
4.0,Great swing!
4.0,Good quality considering the price! Works efficient and would recommend!
4.0,slightly high wasted and I am short but overall like this dress very much. does require ironing.
4.0,"The dress fit, I usually wear a 22-24 and this fit very tight but the material is stretchy so it is comfortable to wear you def need an undershirt or something under because it is very see through"
4.0,"Sleek and modern, but not a lot of wiggle room. Definitely a minimalist option. Would make an interesting gift."
4.0,"Most reviews I‚Äôve read says order up but it was true in size for me and fit as I expected it to. It is much thinner than the picture and the description which was a little disappointing but still a great fit, comfortable, and happy customer otherwise. Due to the thinnest compared to the picture is why I gave 4 stars rather than 5."
4.0,"It is much brighter than I expected. I needed yellow, so why not bling it up a bit with gold for this holiday season."
4.0,"Very nice necklace - especially for the money.  Looks exactly like an expensive necklace a friend has.  Don't think you could tell the difference without close examination.  The disc in the middle jiggles around a little, and the chain could be nicer, but honestly you could switch out the chain if you need a more expensive look.  I look forward to getting more discs to change the look and wear it more casually.  Also, it took kind of long to get, but was delivered in the time frame they promised."
4.0,Well made it was a bit big.
4.0,"More comfortable than any we've bought,  before. Flag makes it easy to orient each time it's used. Comes out well after hand wash and overnight towel dry. Soft. Covers face easily and well......planning to get 10 more.....gave away too many to family."
4.0,Very nice and even though a lady... very me. Works well. Took a while to arrive but other than that a nice watch that functions well.
4.0,Like the fit and style. Stands up in the wash.
4.0,I love this sweater especially the sparkles on it
4.0,It was a gift. After asking a few Chinese friends it turned out that it had nothing to do with roosters. I had to apologize.
4.0,"It's the best looking Venom suit for kids. The other ones are either not comic book accurate, look really weird in the face, did too much with the mouth/tongue, or didn't bother lining up the printing so the shape of the face is really bad when wearing. There is a minor issue with the printing on the hands that doesn't align properly so the white webbing patches on the suit are kind of shifted on to the side of the hands and not on the back of the hands."
4.0,Pockets! Plus I got a lot of compliments on the style and pattern.
4.0,Fits well except the shoulders bunch ever so slightly at the seam. Not too noticeable if you're not looking for it but once you see it it creates an odd shape to the shoulders.
4.0,"Looks cute,and is functional. This was a gift,and the recipient is pleased with it."
4.0,seems to be made well
4.0,"I wanted drawstring on inside of waistband.  Photo on Amazon shows smooth-front waistband, no drawstring visible. Item received has drawstring outside on front of waistband, creating a lump under shirt. Have purchased this brand and style before so don‚Äôt understand discrepancy.  (my pants in photo are blue, don‚Äôt understand why they appear grey in photo)."
4.0,Buy a couple of sizes bigger because it WILL shrink.
4.0,The collars sit up higher than the pictures illustrated but it will still work.
4.0,"Really pretty dress. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it on a breezy day :)<br />Pros:<br />Very pretty<br />Great flow<br />As described<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not made for busty women. I‚Äôm a DDD/F and the top doesn‚Äôt come close to closing. I‚Äôll have to wear something inside of it, which kind of goes against my reason for purchasing (nursing)"
4.0,if had clips at back for attaching to pants would be great; holds all my photography bits and not too hot
4.0,I like the fit of this dress and its cute overall. My only complaint is that the satin insets were 'off' in color. The color wasnt rich enough to match the style of the dress. I had to return it because I wanted it for a work function and it didnt fit the bill.
4.0,"Surprisingly well made! Came with an extension piece which is awesome for fluxuation in weight and size. Not the best fit when moving, but great for the cost. Love the steel gray color."
4.0,"There dress fit fine (it‚Äôs stretchy), but I felt like the v was too low so I added some lace to make it a little less revealing. Cute and simple."
4.0,It does slip down throughout the day
4.0,"I think this is a very well made bracelet, it has 3 adjustable sizes on it so it can got onto a variety of wrists easily and it has a cute playful look to it.<br /><br />What I like most about his bracelet is the style, I really enjoy leather strap bracelets a lot I think they are very attractive in a variety of styles and sizes. This one is unique because it has the plain strap on the bottom with a twisted leather on top which spices it up a bit.<br /><br />What I don't get is how this bracelet (at least when I bought it, not sure it the title has changed) it was marketed for men, while I am a woman with very small wrists to begin with (I typically can wear children's jewelry without a problem) and while the smallest setting fits me fine the middle one is only slightly looser. So if I would put it on the largest setting it would be barely to large for me, which I believe would be quite small for most men. Also on the downside the leather is very stiff so it's actually quite uncomfortable to wear the first few days until you get to &#34;break it in&#34; but that sort of comes with the territory.<br /><br />Overall though I think it's a nice buy just keep in mind that it seems to run on the small side.<br /><br />Note I did receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own and are completely honest."
4.0,Purchased this product for an infant and didn't fit too well. Will work well in the future
4.0,"Based on the product description and reviews I ordered an xxl vs. my normal size M/L. That's no big deal, and it fits perfectly.<br />Really, I LOVE it! It's so cute. I get tons of compliments. I've actually worn it backwards (with the bows in front) once or twice and it looks adorable either way.<br />Obviously, it is all lace I wouldn't even think to put it in the washer.  For the price it's absolutely worth it!!"
4.0,"These (26w, 27l: ~size 2) were too big and also shorter than standard short size.<br /><br />The material is jegging, not stretchy denim.<br />It has a front zip and functional back pockets, but the front pockets are not functional.<br /><br />I'm returning the pair I got because they're way too big. Haven't decided if I'm going to buy a different size (might drop to 24w, 29l). I was really hoping for denim, but these were pretty comfortable.<br /><br />5'4"", 125lbs, 2pants, xs/s shirt"
4.0,"Item was what I expected, it's comfy and fits fine."
4.0,"It's a very cute dress. Fabric is a bit on the cheaper side for my taste, but I donated this to my sisters friend. She looked stunning with it on at an event she put together."
4.0,"The lens don't alter, but they do help when using electronics, providing a yellow tint which cuts strain.  One of the arms broke within 10 days of use so very poorly made."
4.0,"Quality sock, sewn well, nice bottom, Cute cuff. But if you‚Äôre 9-9.5 like me‚Ä¶.bit cramped."
4.0,I purchased a Nook hd as a family gift for Christmas and was surprised at the cost of the accessories at Barnes & Nobel.  Searching online for cases I came across this one that seemed to have all the features I wanted at about 1/3 the price.  I received the case in time to put it on the Nook hd before I wrapped it up and was very pleased with how it looks and fits.  I haven't had much chance to put it to use yet but my first impression is very good!
4.0,"Super cute dress but it does run small in the bust area but loose in the hips.  I loved the side pockets.  I am 5"" 2"" 112 lbs, the dress did not need to be hemmed.  I ended up returning the dress as it was too tight in the bust.  I am a 32 C.  This would be a good dress for someone smaller in the bust with curvy hips.  Overall, good quality just didn't fit."
4.0,"I have decided not to return these, but to give them to a friend as a birthday gift.  I cannot use them because they are for pierced ears.  They are beautiful!"
4.0,Very affordable and very cute.
4.0,"Definitely not as bad as some reviews stated. If you're looking for a bag to dress up an outfit for special occasions this is it. Definitely not something for everyday use. The shoulder strap is thinner than it should be so I can see how some are saying it broke quickly but you can always change it out. Zippers aren't made of plastic but what bothered me about them is that the zipper teeth and zipper slider aren't the same colored gold which makes it look cheap. In all, it's cute, nice size, just keep in mind that you get what you pay for! Appreciate it for the price :)"
4.0,"I like all the color choices.  I wear a size 10 and after they are washed they are a bit small, but I can still use them."
4.0,"I have fairly small wrists (female) and this was just a tad bit bigger than what I had hoped for. It did stay but if I were to fling my arm, my bracelet would roll off and go flying. The elastic on the smaller bracelet was very sturdy. As for the larger bracelet, the elastic was very stretchy, but it fit very nice for smaller male wrists (not completely skinny but averagely small)"
4.0,Will fit beautifully with my dragon skin renaissance outfit.<br />Exactly what is needed for a finishing touch!
4.0,"I got this wallet because I was tired of carrying around a massive foldable wallet. This wallet is much thinner and seems well made. I can‚Äôt carry as many cards or cash as my previous wallet did but it‚Äôs able to comfortably fit your id, 4 credit/debit cards, a few bills of cash, and side openings for a few other additional cards. I like that it forces me to not be a hoarder with my wallet. The only downside is the card slots leave a residue on the cards after they‚Äôve been inside for awhile. Fortunately, the residue cleans off easily."
4.0,The bottoms were too big!
4.0,"This is a very pretty bag. It's fashionable, that handles feel sturdy, and the strap is pretty long. It's not as big as I thought it would be, but it's a good sidlze for an everyday purse. My only issue is that the handles are designed so that they don't fall all the way to the sides of the bag, as you can see in the photo."
4.0,Should have ordered a smaller size but it is very comfortable..
4.0,"I was excited to order this shirt because for the price, it was a great deal but it was smaller than expected. The length was perfect since I wanted to wear it with leggings and the sleeves were great (not too tight, not too long or short) but it fit a it too snug in the belly. I normally wear an xl-xxl in tops so I ordered the xxl and it's too snug fitting in the belly area for me to be comfortable. I'll probably put something on the front and gift it or just wear it around the house instead of sending it back. But if you don't have a bit of a belly or if you're a smaller built girl then you'll probably be very happy with this shirt!"
4.0,I liked it because Is comfortable Flowey and very pretty
4.0,Fit a little to loose. Didn‚Äôt look right on daughter. Returned.
4.0,The cold shoulder patch run till your shoulder. Need to make an effort so that it doesn‚Äôt ride up. Material is not cotton/soft which I thought it would be. Overall loved it
4.0,"The pendant is cute, but the necklace isn't what is in the pictures. It's not as long and there is a little chain at the end of the black parts to close it."
4.0,Fix just fine. Product was a good fit and decent. Also got a inflatable  drink holder in the same bag as the swimsuit
4.0,"Does what they are supposed too, however I have to use one bag per shoe so keep that in mind for mens dress shoes."
4.0,I like how the outfit fits. The top is just a lil small but it's still good.
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Good quality. Lost one star because size is off. Runs big, so had to return it for one that fits"
4.0,For my glasses
4.0,"I got this in medium and it's pretty small, esp the head hole. I measure 35/25/35 and usually take a small. It looks a little cheap but it's cute."
4.0,"I was scurrying around for the last two weeks looking for a costume and I decided to order the Red devil outfit 3 days before our Halloween party.  The product came in time and definitely was pleasing when I opened the package.  I am 5'5&#34; and about 165 and the large fit me well.<br /><br />As you can see in my photos, the outfit was long enough but safely sized so I wouldn't trip over it.  It was chilly here and due to the length of the outfit I was able to camouflage that I was wearing anything underneath.  It came with a belt but it didn't have a hook like belts we use so was getting a bit annoying watching it fall off my waist.  Thus my 4 star rating.<br /><br />I enjoyed that the merchant packaged this product in a heavy mil plastic pouch so I can use for storing for another event.  I am a photographer by trade so having outfits handy is always a great thing.<br /><br />Look forward to ordering another theme costume next year.  Thanks."
4.0,"I expected it to be bigger but if it was bigger it'd look silly so I decided I liked the size the way it is. Um, I can't wear it if I get hot because I have sensitive skin and I discovered it gives me a rash but if I don't get hot, I'm aces. All around great product and I was super excited when I got it in the mail"
4.0,The actual elastic band is small and gets flipped. Since it is small I notice no tummy control than any other pair of pants. The line does make your butt pop but I wouldn‚Äôt say these lift it.
4.0,This dress fit perfectly. My only issue is the back is pretty see through. The front is not because it‚Äôs two layers of material but the back is just one layer.
4.0,"I love the dress, the fabric is nice and it's good quality, super comfy too, the only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I cannot get away with wearing it without a belt, it looks just too big on me, which is fine I guess it looks better on a taller person, I'm 5'4, so I look like I'm wearing a potato bag, but with a belt it looks beautiful, got so many compliments"
4.0,It has pockets !
4.0,"This is perfect to wear with a snug, long-sleeved top, a snug pair of jeans, and a pair of tall boots. Very comfortable! Yes, it is sleeveless, but nonetheless, it is still quite warm. The sizing is perfect-true to size. The only real negative aspect about this item was the fact that it's a lot of white---mine is actually an off-white color---but either way it is easy to get dirty or stained, so you have to be more aware when wearing this item. Just don't be careless. Being truly careless would be NOT purchasing this item!!"
4.0,"The watch arrived in very good condition and appears to do an excellent job of keeping the time. Stopwatch function performs as expected.<br /><br />Two minor complaints about the watch are as follows: the light on it is underpowered and gives extremely mediocre viewing angles (though it is definitely useable) and the watch makes a beeping noise when cycling through modes. The second point is likely by design, but I personally find it disruptive when used in a professional environment."
4.0,The dress is beautiful. But it was pretty big even tied as tight as I could tie it without the tie in the back looking goofy. Its a beautiful dress but it did run a bit large for us. It was hanging too low to use for our photos
4.0,"I'm about 5'7 170lbs and the medium fits very well. It hides the part of my tummy like I want it to. Probably could even wear the small and still get that southern girl/cowgirl flare.I will probably buy more in other colors, since I have a redneck wedding coming up in August."
4.0,Good outfit. My five year old wants to be Bluey for Halloween so this will do considering it‚Äôs so hard to find Bluey merchandise in the States. Fits her good. I should‚Äôve went up a size due to our Halloween‚Äôs being cold and will need to stuff a coat underneath. Mask is made of felt and my daughter loves it.
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this.  I think it‚Äôs a great dress to wear in between seasons, when it‚Äôs too cold for short dresses, and too warm for heavy dresses.  The cut is very interesting too, very different from other dresses I‚Äôve had.  It goes a wee bit too high on my thigh for my taste, but this is easily remedied by wearing leggings with it, which also completes the look.  :)"
4.0,"Bought for a gift. Very pretty, just wish the length of the chain was a few inches longer."
4.0,"Cottony and sweat wicking but not as flexible and moveable as you would assume for workout attire. Maybe if I took leisurely walks, but for running and HIIT, I feel it moving across my skin. Don‚Äôt like to be aware of my clothes when I work out. Prob could‚Äôve gotten the same T for 25% of the price without the Nike check"
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot. It fits well. The color is not ""heather red"" its bright red."
4.0,Just as described!  Fit as expected.  Nice silk feel and weight.  I'm Happy
4.0,Shirt looks and feels great. Only 4 stars due to receiving blue heather instead of purple heather. Still love it all the same. Would also make a great fishing shirt!
4.0,Nice summer tank. Lite and airy.  Not too sheer.  Only sheer at certain angles and certain lighting.
4.0,Love the way it fits.  Looks good as well.
4.0,"Cute, but the fabric has no give at all, and the cut is shapeless. It looks good with the belt, but without it it just kind of looks like a sack. Ruffles aren't as big or nice as in the picture. I'm 5'6&#34;, US size 10/12, 36D and I got a large. It fits as expected."
4.0,"I ordered a set to give my twinners for Christmas. I read the reviews and went true size because my girls were in between sizes. The reviews were right, they're really small. So when the girls outgrew them (it's been a month) I ordered a size bigger. The price is pretty unbeatable. I posted a pic of the size 6-9 months overtop of a 6 month Carter's brand. It should be way bigger... And it is smaller. Basically order a whole size bigger than you need and they're great."
4.0,Beautiful just too tight for my wrist üòü
4.0,Love this!  Looks great on and stays put
4.0,"This dress is adorable and very summery! The sizing is about right for me (5'1"" and 150lbs) and I ordered the large. I would recommend this as a casual dress as the quality is not the highest, but it is very flattering for most."
4.0,"Nice finish and construction.  The butterfly clasp can be a little finicky about staying closed.  Comes with tool but the pin can bend quite easily so buy a separate, better tool if you can."
4.0,Nothing much to say but WOW just picture perfect.
4.0,I totally love these. They‚Äôre so cute & comfortable but unfortunately they stretch out really fast.
4.0,"They looked cute, fit a little snugly, but broke within the first 2 hours. That is why I am only giving 4 stars."
4.0,"Good dress, nice handiwork...overall worth the price"
4.0,Comfort üåø
4.0,"The dress was surprisingly comfortable. I thought the sparkly material might be itchy but it wasn‚Äôt. The material also has a good amount of stretch to it. The black under skirt lining is a bit short in the back and doesn‚Äôt fully cover my butt. However, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be noticeable. I would prefer if it was longer tho, just in case the lighting causes the outer sparkley material to be more transparent. Overall, the dress is nice for the price it is at."
4.0,"I don't use a dryer so, air dry, and with these socks, you'll need about 4-5 days for that to happen.  So, perhaps stock up if you can't wait that long.  ."
4.0,"I ordered a size smaller but it's still a little bit  big. I still wear it though and I love it, I might order another pair . smaller this time ..:)"
4.0,I was expecting a maxi dress type material and this is a very shiny weird nylon material instead of a maxi dress it's comfortable and nice for summertime but the top is a little bit baggy so I would definitely size down a little bit
4.0,I really liked this purchase & it was a great deal
4.0,"It comes exactly as shown. Color is good and type/logo is nice. It‚Äôs a Northface brand but the XXL is a little tight (not too much) but kind of snug. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the other Northface XXL I purchased (which is much looser). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the way it fits on ME or if this is a design issue but the neck tends to keep riding up which forces me to have to pull it down; again, I don‚Äôt know if this is the design or my body wearing it.<br /><br />Overall it‚Äôs not bad. Pretty good buy."
4.0,worked as expected but it was very warm
4.0,Serves its purpose but not a lot of support for larger breasts
4.0,64 diamonds around the face. fake but they look real.
4.0,"Got this for my boyfriend, decent robe but kind of thin material."
4.0,"I ordered the large instead of my normal medium,  good thing I did!"
4.0,Very good no doubt.
4.0,This was given as a gift and my daughter loved it.
4.0,"This shorts design has it all!<br />Pockets, moisture wicking fabrics, a sporty color scheme and compression wear built right into the set. Shorts have a comfortable elastic waist band and a handy drawstring as well. Shorts fit as expected at the waist. I have a 29-30‚Äù waist and the medium is perfect. The compression pants fit snug enough to allow you to securely keep a phone in the right hip pocket. The 2 rear pockets have zippers but are just deep enough for a wallet or cash.<br />Great design for running."
4.0,"Looks great on, feels great too! Thanks"
4.0,"I like these socks.  The foot space is very comfortable and they are soft.  However, they are too tight at the ankles.  Arrived quickly and well packaged.  Thank you."
4.0,"Really nice gloves for the price and nice fit, but the touch screen feature essentially does not work."
4.0,pretty in pink nice tassel...will get another color
4.0,"Bought because I read that the fabric was cotton blend.  Sadly, this is all Polyester.  Soft but still not as expected.  However, I kept it hoping it will work for a few times this summer over my suit.  Fit is generous and color is bright."
4.0,The glasses are polarized which is great and they are like weight with a sleek design
4.0,It‚Äôs ok. I think I need a smaller size to help support the girls. I‚Äôm a 36DD. It is very stretchy. Overall not bad.
4.0,4 stars only because it‚Äôs not the real thing but it is a great shirt! I bought one size up expecting a little shrinkage after the first wash and I was correct. Great fit and quality
4.0,"Very comfy, seems to be of good quality. I'm a size 10 and the 10 is a little small."
4.0,a little small but still fits
4.0,This is a nicely made product but much larger than I expected -- to large for me... but is great if you have loads of ear rings!
4.0,Love it but it was a bit too small. Will be exchanging for a bigger size.
4.0,"I really enjoy this watch band, but since it's white its already showing black marks and dirt. But its really sturdy and I knew white what a potential risk."
4.0,Great dress! Fits well and pockets are a plus. The down side is I prefer fabric in dresses to be the same. The top half is like a jersey material and the lower is more of a cotton. But still great and will still wear it.
4.0,had a few adjustments to do around my waist as im a shapely woman and its perfect one of my favourite outfits owned
4.0,A great gift....
4.0,Super cute! but ran small for the size I ordered. If you plan on ordering this and want it to be a loose I would recommend going a next size up.
4.0,"Pretty color, great price"
4.0,I bought the turquoise colored dress with pockets ! As a teacher pockets are everything lol! I wore Nike pros underneath just incase so you couldn't see my underwear line (without it you could) ! It's a very cute and casual dress for summer
4.0,Fit well. Thinner fabric than expected. The tears would tear more when you try to squat though...
4.0,Really beautiful earrings. They are very sharp looking. My only dislike is that the pearls seem excessively large when I smile. That's a personal preference but they seem to stick out more.
4.0,"Like the style, like the fit, like the color.  Don't like that it must be ironed after washing."
4.0,This Santa Dress/tunic is adorable. The Santa applique is so nice. It is well made. I would definitely buy it again. The price is very good for a holiday theme article of clothing.
4.0,"It was pretty good. Fabric was pretty and good quality. However the cut wasn't ideal for my body. I needed more of a fit and flair with a lower waist, maybe a v for my chest. The fabric was a bit tight and especially on my chest which is, admittedly, abnormally large. I sent this back and wore a dress I already had to the party. Overall, good quality, pretty dress. I was impressed at what $30 could get me on Amazon. I will try other styles of dress from this same brand."
4.0,Nice sturdy bag. Wish it were larger. It would be nice to be able to fit more in it
4.0,love this wallet.  highly functional and good quality classic style.
4.0,I really did like the dress but the sleeves were way too tight!
4.0,These glasses are fine for the money.  They serve the purpose--not very sturdy.  I would probably buy them again.
4.0,"They look great and fit great once they're in, the only caveat is that the flares are very large (MUCH larger than they appear in the picture; the flares are 16mm on the pair I received, 9/16&#34; wearable is 14mm), so if you haven't got stretchy lobes it may be difficult to get them in and out without using oil."
4.0,"I like everything about these vests but they do wrinkle when I hang them up in the closet too close to other clothing and when you sit down.  However, I really don't care so much about the wrinkled back since I don't have to see it.  The material is very soft and hangs beautifully.  The slight overhang at the shoulders really makes the vest look nice and all of the colors are nice for fall/winter.  I live in a warm state; but if I lived where I was constantly wearing a heavy coat, I'd probably put the vest on once I got to work so that it would not wrinkle from wearing the coat.  I'm also short and the length on these vests is just below the butt area, which hides a multitude of sins.  I purchased a large as I wear a large size blouse.  I would not order a larger size than usual as the vest would be to full and just add bulk."
4.0,Thought they were too small
4.0,"They are a little bigger than I expected, but I still like them."
4.0,very cute.  Can't beat the price
4.0,My daughter asked for these for Christmas. They were a bit pricey...I don't know that I would have paid that much if they weren't a gift...but they are soft and cute and she loves them.
4.0,I am very happy with these leggings.  However I did not get the colors I ordered.  I ordered the 3pack black-grey-navy. I got 2 Black and 1 Grey.  I returned them and tried to reorder the 3 pack of black-grey-navy and  again I got2 black and 1 grey.  I tried calling but all I got was how to return them.  I need to know how to correct this.  Any Ideas
4.0,I got these for my nephew! He loves them!
4.0,"Gorgeous coloring. It‚Äôs more of a mustard color vs a brown. Does fit true to size, but, it‚Äôs a short cut. Still cute with jeans or a pair of work pants. I didn‚Äôt find this sweater to be itchy or uncomfortable to wear. This is a very cute piece!"
4.0,Cheaper quality but overall satisfied with my purchase
4.0,"We got the turquoise hat with the whale, so we could take our son to the river. Its a little large, but he looks adorable and it definitely blocked the sun and kept him protected!"
4.0,Mad compliments and very good Vision in sunny environments. A little hard to see in the shade but nice for the price. People ask me about them all the time and are surprised by the price.
4.0,"Love this dress, but if you have boobs bigger than an A cup, the material stretches and looks pretty terrible. So size up if you have boobs. Other than that, super cute dress."
4.0,"Warm and flattering is a tough combination, but they got it right. I am 145 lb, 5'8&#34; and found that the medium fit well, except for slightly short arms. The seat of the pants ripped after 3 months of near constant use. I am going to buy another pair."
4.0,I usually wear a medium so I ordered a medium. I'm 5'4&#34; 145 lbs. It is bigger than I thought but I don't know how it can get any smaller if I ordered a small so I won't return it. It's designed to be lose and flowy. The back is shorter than the front but it covers my butt. It's a good way to cover up for the summer.
4.0,"Took a while to arrive, but they are nice."
4.0,Tight in the ankle and top.that being said i have muscular thick legs so with some stretching they will be fine. Worth the effort. They are well made and gorgeous. I love them.
4.0,"Delivery on this was great, and I was happy with the overall quality of the belt. The main problem I have encountered thusfar is the metal edges are very sharp and will need to be sanded down, or i will quickly cut myself on them."
4.0,Cute! Compliments! Good quality for priceüòé
4.0,"I liked the look of this dress, except that the collar looks weird to me. It's asymmetric and it drives me nuts. The real reason I need to return it is that it is too loose on me. Even though I ordered a small (I normally wear medium), I would probably fit something slightly smaller. The fabric is stretchy where it needs to be, but the chest and stomach area are super loose."
4.0,It's a very elegant and beautiful necklace for the price.When I received the necklace one rose fell off the necklace.I decided to pull the other rose off and now I still have pretty necklace with one purple rose in the middle.
4.0,"I love how they fit, I ordered a small I‚Äôm about 135 lbs and I‚Äôm 5,6."
4.0,Worked well as superhero cuffs as part of a costume
4.0,I love these glasses.  Stylish and sturdy
4.0,Super warm gloves I found myself having to take them off to cool off my hands here and there in 25-35* and snowing. Only issue I have with them is the liner is not connected to the outer layer in the fingers so when you pull your hand out sometimes it pulls the liner with it making it difficult to get the finger lining back where it's supposed to be while putting your hands back in. If not for that would be 5 star
4.0,"I love this scarf, and have ordered several from this seller in different colors. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because the color was not exactly as pictured. The coral scarf I received was brighter than the picture."
4.0,"Very cute, fits well, and is lightweight but snags on everything. I should have known that a knit you throw into a beach bag would snag but I didn‚Äôt. It snags on the kids shoes, the beach bag, etc. It‚Äôs not very noticeable but just know this when purchasing it."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ca22c149fd492afc38cb9aa46b9cb22b]] The rose gold color is slightly different than the watch itself.
4.0,Comfortable fit but sport is misspelled :D
4.0,"This cute, and the print is what I wanted.  However, it doesn't accommodate duplicate checks.  So, I had to figure out how to insert my cheap plastic cover into this one.  It isn't a perfect fit, but works."
4.0,Kind of disappointed that the coloring was off a bit but it‚Äôs perfect for my daughter to use for her baby dolls accessories.
4.0,"My dad is a math geek and he loved this shirt. However, he wears a large and the sleeves seemed a bit small"
4.0,"I love it, I have a lot of things that go with it. I've been wearing it a lot. Would order again."
4.0,"I had a goggle to go over eyeglasses, but it is not comfortable for long. This Berko fits well and is not as uncomfortable, though my face  was sweating during a 15 minute dog walk.<br />I bought these goggles to protect my eyes from smoke. Yjat worked today, better test tomorrow."
4.0,Beautiful scarf and lightweight. True colors and soft.
4.0,"The belt is leather and looks pretty decent.  It doesn't have the feel or look of real quality, but is better than others I've seen for the price, maybe even some I've bought....time will tell.  It works well, and can be altered if necessary...size was fine as it came for me."
4.0,"My son loved it, good quality, order a size up ."
4.0,I don't like the printed on exclamation marks. It's a soft material and the small fits well. I dig it.
4.0,This hat is beautiful and I'm pleasantly surprised how nice it is for the price. I bought it for a Kentucky derby party and didn't want to spend a lot of money for something I wear once. But it's well worth the money and my only complaint is the seam is very noticeable in the very front of the fascinator.
4.0,"Exactly as pictured, but most of them dont fit my ears and they arent adjustable."
4.0,"These shorts are great! They are super comfortable and soft. They have a decent amount of stretch while still feeling secure and comforming. Theres only a few teeny tiny things i dont like. 1. The waistband has rolled down on me a few times. Nothing crazy but i find while sitting it can roll. 2. Idk if its just because i got white, but holy pantylines! Even when i wear a thong you can see the outline a little at the top of the waistband front and back. Maybe wearing a seemless panty would do the trick.. 3. Once, again idk if its because i got white, but it definitely doesn't smooth out my cellulite. On my thighs i can see some little dimples here and there. These are pretty small issues for me so i still love them! The legs dont rool up, super soft and best of all SQUAT PROOF! these are the first white shorts/leggings i have tried that dont show panties under. I got a small."
4.0,FYI This charm did not come with the black box that is showing in the photo.  It came in a red cloth pouch.  But the shark charm itself is really very pretty.
4.0,It's very small but my kids likes it a lot
4.0,"So adorable but runs really large,  will probably use it next 4th of July"
4.0,"I went off on a limb when I bought this shirt, since I usually buy band t's off of Rockabilia and IndieMerch. This  shirt is very nice. Seems to be of high quality. It is officially licensed. My thing is, most band T's are made bigger than normal sizes. So i shrunk mine a few times and it fits ok. I havent had it long, ao i dont know how itll hold up over time."
4.0,"Overall, absolutely love it!! I will be wearing this again but I'll need to fix the pieces that go around the wrist. The little loops for the ribbon to be laced and secured tore at the seems after a few hours of wearing them. I used fabric tape to secure the stocking in place, as you probably would need to with any thigh high stocking. The print is beautiful and great quality. I'm so glad I made this purchase! I used the loops on the back to carry my rave whip around since I didn't have Kasumi's wakizashi."
4.0,"I really loved the shoe but ended up returning it because it didn't fit my daughter who usually wears a size 7. It runs on the small side, but possibly if my daughter had narrower and more petite feet it may have fit. My daughter has chubby feet and it was too tight, otherwise it's really cute and pretty!"
4.0,Great price and shies are exactly ad advertised.
4.0,These were so cute and loved! I would have exchanged for another size if my daughter didn‚Äôt love them so much! Will certainly order another pair. My only complaint is that the eye mask is way too snug and not wearable
4.0,nice soft robe
4.0,Nice looking vest.  Fast shipping.  I ordered a size bigger than normal and it fit great
4.0,I love this dress! It does have pockets which is awesome.the fabric is thinner than I thought tho.
4.0,Good- but tight around toe area.
4.0,Nice lightweight robe. Constucted better than anticipated.
4.0,"it's very pretty, but the way I saw it, I thought it had two in the set.  f"
4.0,I love the material how it fit and add a nice elegant touch to my outfit
4.0,"Super soft and comfortable!  I ordered a Medium, and it fits more like an oversized t-shirt but if you have a long torso, it wouldn‚Äôt be long enough to cover your butt in leggings.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 & 145lbs with a shorter torso, and I‚Äôm was hoping to wear this with my bike shorts, but it isn‚Äôt long enough.  Still cute tied with jeans though!"
4.0,"They look amazing! good packaging, good quality materials; however, the glasses are a bit heavy and leave a mark on your nose... so it is hard to wear them for longer periods of time."
4.0,They are pretty good. Great price. Some of the socks seem like they're a size too small. But over all they're nice for the price.
4.0,Glows in the dark even without holding to the light. Looks like a real ant. The &#34;chain&#34; is just black cord. Love it.
4.0,It looks good I thought there be more detail but love it
4.0,This is a great swimsuit for those who want a modest suit.  I gave it 4 stars because the top has a slit at the stomach area and occasionally will show your stomach.
4.0,"I bought this sandal for my daughter who was recently diagnosed with overpronation of both her feet. It was recommended to keep her in a shoe with arch support. However, we live in FL. It is impossible during the summer to keep your kid in shoes, they want to wear flip flops. So I bought these sandals for her so that when she goes to the beach or pool she doesn't have to wear sneakers. Her physical therapist liked them as far as flip flops go, but of course recommended that she only wear these for short periods of time as her feet require support to overcome her overpronation. We have now had them for a little over a month and she complains less of her feet hurting after wearing these then she does with her other regular flip flops."
4.0,"If I could give this three and a half stars, I would. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the pictures or the paint of this product. However, anyone who wants to get into jewelry making better have jumper rings. They're only like $3 but it's the extra hassle on top of it.<br />Overall, it's not bad enough to be three stars. However, it's not good enough to be a four-star item either."
4.0,Great shirt suggest ordering 1 size down your normal size
4.0,"These look as good in person as they do online, but they run small.  I followed the sizing guide but still need to return.  Recommend going up 1 or 2 sizes for a fit like the model. Otherwise nice shorts and will be reordering the correct size."
4.0,"Didn't think they were so big. They are the size of a quarter. Look a little cheap, but work well for what they are needed for."
4.0,"This slipper is very comfortable. The fitting is half a size too small, so I recommend buying one size up."
4.0,"I have been looking for tassel earrings for a couple now because they are such a trend right now. Found these price right and not so frilly, I did find them a little big but I took two tassels off and trimmed so that they weren't so large. Now they are just perfect."
4.0,"Item exactly as described.  Size good although a couple of inches longer than I am wearing nowadays. I did not like the black stitching on the white part of the fabric, it cheapened it a little and I undid and resewed it with matching cotton. But overall it is a nice top that is not too thin.  I ordered a large (size 14) and it was a perfect fit. I am pleased I bought this item."
4.0,I like my new shirt of one of my favorite characters.
4.0,Gave it to a cousin  for a present for her baby looked nice  and she liked it
4.0,not crazy about having to wear these but I am experiencing ankle swelling.  The socks take care  of the problem.  I don't like how it cuts in just under your knee.  Otherwise my legs feel good when I have them
4.0,Looks and feels great! Well made but had to return because it was too much for just home use
4.0,Size Small didnt fit
4.0,Using the guide for fitment I had measurements that varied from SM to XL depending upon the position measured.  Decided I needed XL.  The shorts are ok but not a perfect fit.
4.0,Love the watch. Picture is vibrant and as shown. I love that the wrist strap is rubber. This watch is NOT a watch that will fit a grown man's wrist unless he has a petite wrist. This watch will fit a boy/teen's wrist.
4.0,"I ordered one size bigger than I usually wear...and it was still small--well it fit, but not the way I wanted it to. I returned them and I'm waiting for the next larger size. Sure hope it fits as I liked the fabric.<br />Later...I just received the second pair of PajamaJeans 2 sizes bigger than I usually wear...and they are perfect! I love the fact that there is a drawstring around the waist to adjust waist and hip size....and did I mention the comfort! These jeans move with you and do not bind. I am going to get another pair I like them so much!"
4.0,"This little wristlet is absolutely what I was hoping it would be- it easily fits my iPhone 7plus in one pocket and keys, chapstick and a couple pieces of gum in the other pocket.  I love how the card slots and change purse is in the middle.  The purse is so soft, you would never guess vegan leather.  Several of my friends assumed it was an expensive name-brand wristlet!  I will definitely be ordering in other colors."
4.0,"I know its a random lot of 30 surgical steel barbells but some of the designs were unnecessary. Considering I am not a child, I do not want a spongebob tongue ring! As well as some of the others i got...who likes green bay? not me...so some of these were given away and left with about 20 or so."
4.0,"muy bonita, de tama√±o que se indica, calza perfecto"
4.0,"high quality bracelet, my wife loved it. sturdy design and elegant. my only regret is that it is not adjustable."
4.0,"Jacket is high quality, but this is not youth. Opened to wrap for Christmas, and it‚Äôs way too big. Need to find something else by tomorrow to give as a gift."
4.0,When I first saw it I was like woah! Did I order another dress and not PJs? I tried it on and was like this totally looks like it could be a day dress paired with a belt. I wish it was slightly shorter for bed. And also Ive noticed after wearing It a few times it seems to be getting runs in it kind of like stockings would not sure if it for caught on something but there are quite a few spots.
4.0,"Se ve hermoso en mis manos, se ve bien para mujeres le compre uno a mi hermana y le queda bien es unisex tambien"
4.0,"This is a very nice lightweight sweatshirt, I love the pockets and the button detail. Calling it a tunic is a little generous, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and it barely hits my hips, I would love it if it were a couple inches longer."
4.0,"It's wasn't fit to my face way to heavy for me but everything else it's good as get, design it's really lovely Stylish"
4.0,"I'm 6ft 3in 195lbs I usually wear a medium. I ordered a xl based on the size chart and other reviews. The legs are a little to short and the waist is a little loose. I'd guess that a large would have been better for the waist but not the length. There is no compression here. However, they are comfortable and very soft. I wore these under my ski pants for snow shoeing. with the waist being a little large they liked to slide down.<br />I would try them again in the large size and hope the length wouldn't be a problem if there was some compression."
4.0,"Very nice, just what I wanted when I ordered!  Came on time."
4.0,"These masks run small. One size will not fit all. I compare the size of this mask to that of the average child's. It will fit them comfortably, or someone who has a smaller head. The mask itself is made of a soft, breathable fabric. This makes it easy to wear for long periods of time, and easy to clean. Simply put into a garment bag and throw into the washing machine and hang to air dry."
4.0,"This bag is lighter gauge than the old army surplus stuff but still pretty good, and actually a little more comfortable to use"
4.0,"Very snug fit for a 12!!<br />Top of socks way to short, should go to mid calf or a bit more.<br />Do keep your feet warm."
4.0,"I bought these to give away as gifts with purchase for my small business.  They‚Äôre cute, lightweight, and hand perfectly.  They are small in size, and don‚Äôt overwhelm the neck or look too big and bulky.  They‚Äôre the perfect gift to tuck into a stocking or keep and wear all season long.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting perfection considering I bought them cheap and in bulk, but they exceeded my expectations."
4.0,Nice color. Not lined but that's fine given the great price. I have a slip that I plan on wearing underneath.  I ordered a size smaller based on a review.  DON'T.  Order your regular size.
4.0,The stretcher works better if the waist band is water down before stretching.
4.0,These are very pretty earrings.  They came well packaged and in good condition.  The only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that they are a bit lighter than I had hoped.
4.0,"The design is beautiful and it falls perfectly on my neck. I never have to worry about the clasp falling to the front which is a great achievement for me. But the clasp is a little loose, so make sure you know where your necklace is if you get jostled."
4.0,"Like all others, the one sock that I need to stay up the most rolls down in my knee crease and cuts off circulation. Kind of defeating the purpose of the sock. Toe area is a little tight too. Maybe these are my problems."
4.0,Comfortable and eased husband's neuropathy pain.
4.0,So the pants are really cute and the fabric is nice and breathable. The colors are vibrant and the stitching is great. However these pants don't fit like they do in the picture and I'm actually really okay with that. The pants are not very loose around the thigh. I'm 5'4&#34; and have pretty athletic legs but they're still scrawny lol so if you want loose legged pants order a size up(I ordered a small). Also the waist is reallllllllly high waisted. It falls about 2-3 inches above my belly button but still it works really well! Since the waist is so high if you have a cute bralette or sports bra it pairs well but still barely shows much skin!! Also these fit really well around your bum making it pop! Overall I'd buy again they're really cute just different then what the picture shows
4.0,"They look exactly as the pictures, I was expecting them to be just a little bit bigger, but still love them."
4.0,"very cute, will make nice hang tags for jewelry"
4.0,"Fit is a touch smaller and shorter than I would have preferred. That being said, the camisoles are well made of a very nice fabric, and lay nicely. Would I buy again? Yes, definitely, without hesitation!"
4.0,"Nice looking bracelet.  Wish it was made in 3mm stones, however, as the 4x4 is a bit large for day wear."
4.0,This top fit my nephew perfect
4.0,Really cute. Read all the past reviews so I went a size up. Fits great and lots of compliments. :)
4.0,"This is made out of Rayon and it was made in China. It is thin, which I like as I‚Äôm in Florida and can wear it during our winter. It is soft and comfy. I gave 4 stars because the knot is a little higher than some pics show as I thought it would cover my stomach completely. You can see from my pic that the back is longer and it does have nice coverage. I still like the look and I‚Äôm an animal print gal.  I washed the shirt and hung it to dry...waiting to see if it shrunk. I‚Äôll edit review if it did shrink."
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter<br />She loved it & said it fit great
4.0,Arrived and fits as advertised.
4.0,"This shoe is so comfortable it‚Äôs like walking on a cloud. I am now purchasing them in another color. Some people have complained about the buckle, I attached the buckle before putting on the shoe and it stayed attached all day. I love them. Yes I have recommended them to others."
4.0,My daughter loves the pattern. But they fit really big. She‚Äôs a size 9 and I got the 9/10s and her feet are swimming in the boots.
4.0,"Very nice hat, kids loved it"
4.0,"I like the necklace by itself but the picture of the wolf is slightly blurry, it‚Äôs noticeable."
4.0,Really soft and cute! Sized a little large but it worked!
4.0,"Very cute. Fits as expected. It‚Äôs a bit tougher material than expected, but I like how it fit.<br />I bought a size medium, and am usually a size 10 in USA"
4.0,I just got these today and they appear very durable. Nice quality for the price. I haven't worn them a full day yet but I will see how well they do on my sensitive ears. I would definitely recommend this product.
4.0,Wondrous creation. I worn it inside out  during a sunny crafts fair. Then I wore it flip in and it kept my hair and shoulders dry when it rained.  The creases do not come out though still recommend it to women comfortable with themselves  Thank u
4.0,"This is a one-size item, so it fits as expected, but a bit big for me (size 6). Still good for a beach dress, but that‚Äôs about it. Color is beautiful and the material is thin and a little ‚Äúshiny‚Äù where you can see every little bump and flaw, but like I said, completely beach worthy. I used an empire waist belt to excentuate the fit a bit for myself. Overall, nice dress."
4.0,"Nice material, runs large"
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 130lbs, B cup and I ordered a Medium. It‚Äôs a little snug around the middle but it‚Äôs cute enough to give me incentive to lose 5lbs!<br /><br />Cute, decent quality, wrinkles very easily."
4.0,I really like this wig.  It looks more realistic compared to my other ones which I spent over 50$ on.  It‚Äôs a little bit thin but I don‚Äôt expect it to be anything more for the price.  I will be buying more & would recommend!
4.0,"Very pretty, the medallion is smaller that what I would of like, the B you can not see it very well.  Overall is pretty"
4.0,I think they are cute but I would go up a size.  The back of my foot touches the edge.  For the price they are okay.
4.0,"These are a very good set of nitrile 4ply gloves.  I think the 4 ply gives a bit more dexterity than 6 ply, but it doesn't have the same wear and rip resistance.<br /><br />These are seemingly every bit as good as another ""LINE"" of gloves I use regularly.  These are slightly more expensive in comparison, but having free delivery may make this a five star opportunity for you rather than a four star for me."
4.0,"Comfortable and light weight, but the large was a bit too large based on measurements from the size chart. Easily fixed with a cute belt."
4.0,Like look and feel of this hat
4.0,"Es muy bonita y resistente, solo que es muy peque√±a, la esperaba ver m√°s grande."
4.0,I liked this band. The material could have been a little better quality i wanted more of a cottony feel!! Overall good product though. Very comfortable compared to the rubber bands i like to wear this one at home.
4.0,"It was much bigger than I expected, but it's beautiful.  Also, the chain it came on was cheap and SUPER long."
4.0,Did not come with key chain runs a bit small otherwise love it 10/10
4.0,"They were nice and she was happy, but they seemed very light to me, not like a real piece of gold...."
4.0,This is exactly as described but was hoping it would be longer on the front. It falls right across my chest and makes a large line in thin sweaters i wanted the layer look on. May wear with certain things but not with my thin items.
4.0,Comfortable but pill badly even after washing. They left black lint all over my legs. Second washing seems to help.
4.0,It is a cute dress but the stripes on top did not do anything for me!
4.0,"Runs very small, is decent quality for price. Is cute on if it was the right fit. Would buy again"
4.0,"They‚Äôre too small so my baby weren‚Äôt able to wear them, but bigger if you‚Äôre getting"
4.0,My daughter likes that it versatile and that she can change it to show her mood.
4.0,The are a nice pair of running shorts.  They seem to run a little small but other than that they are great
4.0,"Light, cotton dress. Decent workmanship. Looks like the picture, but... I normally wear 16/18 and ordered the 1x but the 1x does not fit as loose as in the picture.<br />It fits ok now, out of the package, but since it's cotton it will likely shrink the first time i mistakenly wash it in hot water, so i wish it was looser initially.<br />Next time I would order 1 size up just to be sure."
4.0,They are thick and soft. I plan to wear them around the house to keep my feet warm.
4.0,I love the design but the materials are not the best.
4.0,"I didnt buy these on amazon - found em on an other website for a bit cheaper.<br /><br />These are very nice for the price. I use them for fly fishing and even when they get wet your hands stay warm - (I was fishing in 0 degree weather)<br />I have smaller hands so they bunch up a but in the palm but that does not seem to reduce dexterity to much.<br /><br />however they are quite thick so you might find that you cant grasp things quite as firmly. - lets just say be very careful when you are handling your cellphone...<br />also the weave seems a but thin at the base of the thumb - so while these are plenty warm, I am not sure how long they will last.<br /><br />UPDATE: after 2 days of fly fishing, the wool weaving around a few of the fingers is showing signs of fray and the thermal lining has pulled from the stitching holding it in place inside the glove. - Gloves are still very usable and very warm however I do not think these will last for more than a year... down-voted to 4 stars."
4.0,They look great but the material is very thin and kinda uncomfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wearing them in super cold weather?
4.0,"I like polarized flip up sunglasses for fishing, to reduce the glare.  I have purchased several pairs of these.  The grey ones are way too dark in anything but extremely bright sunlight.  The brown ones are still darker than I would prefer, but they are OK.  The polarization reduces the light by 50%, it is not necessary to shade the lens to make it darker.  I would prefer to have flip-up polarized lenses that are lighter yet, and would be willing to pay more for them, but have not been able to find any.  I have never had any problem with the mechanism. These glasses are not great, but they are the best flip-up polarized lenses I have been able to find."
4.0,Loved the fit of this dress for a postpartum photo shoot. Covered my belly and was comfortable to wear. As expected the quality of the fabric is very cheap and I don‚Äôt expect it to last after a few washes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 130lbs and the small fit well. It was a great purchase for a one time event!
4.0,"I just ordered these leggings after hearing they were comparable to LuLaRoe but obviously much cheaper. As a size 16, these plus size leggings fit well. They are a touch too long for me, but, at 5'3'', I've come to expect that will most leggings. The colors are as pictured. I also like that the waistband is not too wide and is very comfortable, similar to lounge pants. I will modify my review should these not hold up as expected but, for now, I think I may have found a good company to buy fun leggings from!"
4.0,"They fit well, sizing is correct. I like how they look like a proper lace up shoes but in fact are laceless, so they are great for kids struggling with shoelaces. 1 star is deducted because the elastic shoelaces are quite loose, so they don‚Äôt enclose the shoes tight enough."
4.0,"Exactly what I expected, I just wish they came with screw backs."
4.0,"Gorgeous print and cut, just too small across the bust"
4.0,Almost like the original but still very usable.
4.0,Fitted perfect not clingy
4.0,granddaughter loves anything Moana
4.0,Better than expected! A
4.0,As described very cute sweater but a bit small
4.0,Great quality. Just frames were a little larger than I had anticipated.
4.0,"Colors are more muted in the picture but its still a pretty skirt. Fabric is very thin. Waist isnt elastic so there's not really any give. Doesnt fit lower near my hips like I hoped & will instead have to hang around my waist, even w/ my navel, which isnt the height I prefer my pants at."
4.0,Nice pretty pleased with purchase
4.0,"Loved it. However, I ended up flipping it inside out so I can get my hair to be in contact with soft satin material."
4.0,Ordered these a few months ago. I wear them almost daily and haven't had any rip or fray on me. I love how the straps are adjustable! Great product for a great price. Not to be worn stand-alone.
4.0,I bought this for my cousin because she was graduating and loves music. It is a lovely message and nice little trinket.
4.0,Beautiful pendant!<br />The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like it is the ‚Äúgold‚Äù too yellow tone.
4.0,Great looking ring really enjoy it.
4.0,Yes I really like this ring.. the only thing I would change is the width but over all it is made with good quality and the sparkle it gives off is also awesome
4.0,"The diamond is high quality and sparking whenever light hits it. So though small it gets the attention it deserves. Came with the certificate confirming e-f color. For the price it is a very good buy. If you have money to spare consider same quality 0.5 carat, if not this is a very good option."
4.0,I‚Äôm giving these a four because they‚Äôre great but they‚Äôre a bitch to get on. Took me a good five to ten minutes to get them in. I have four holes in each ear so I was on the struggle bus. But once you get them it they look simple and cool. I just keep them in unless I have to take them out for a certain outfit and they‚Äôre really comfortable while sleeping so don‚Äôt worry.
4.0,Gorgeous frock for such a price with a cute unicorn floral head band.
4.0,Purchased this as a part of a Halloween costume for my 7 year old son. We did something like the purge & he had already talked about how he liked this mask. I searched for a few days before deciding to go with this one based on the sub par reviews (to clarify lots of the other sellers/reviews were all terrible). Thankfully this purchase was made only to be used for all of 2 hours bc that‚Äôs basically all it lasted. The battery pack seemed to be in tact & at first did what it was intended to by being able to choose between 3 different light settings plus off on the 4th click.. well after only turning it off & on twice it no longer switched between the different options & just stayed on. I‚Äôm ok with the fact that it at least worked lit up but this purchase was definitely not worth more than $4. Overall glad it did what it was intended to do but would never recommend this to anyone!
4.0,"First things first, size up. Next, this is one of the few BTS items that's both reasonably priced and decent quality. The material feels nice and the color is perfect. The wording/design is legible and clear. 4 stars because it wasn't true to size."
4.0,"The pendant looks so beautiful just like in the picture, The only complaint I have is that the chain barely fits around my neck but that might just be because I‚Äôm a big person. But I‚Äôm glad I bought it."
4.0,"Came as expected. Very shiny, very pretty. A little large on me. The steel can be slightly bent to fit, but you can only bend it so much before it looks misshapen. Perhaps if I had used it as an upper arm band... however, I wore it as a cuff and it stayed on without me worrying about it all night. Got lots of compliments on it."
4.0,Great for summer workout or play shirts
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful fitting dress. A must have üòä
4.0,"They are just as pictured and described, a bit too heavy for a charm though"
4.0,Great quality boots! Kept my daughter's foot warm and dry! Fun colors and very comfortable!
4.0,Suit looks exactly as pictured I wish it tied in the back instead of having a cheap little metal clasp but other than that I really like the suit. The top is a little big I think I could have gone a size smaller.
4.0,It‚Äôs nice. Wore it for Easter Sunday
4.0,"Very cute, but fit smaller than expected"
4.0,Is perfect for the &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; parody of an inside joke between my fianc√© and me
4.0,I am a 34-36 D (even DD) cup. Purchased the large and I‚Äôm stuffing myself in. Kept it anyway. It washes well. No shrinking.
4.0,"Was pleased with this purchase. Haven,'t worn them yet. I'm waiting for a special occasion"
4.0,"I needed a white sandal that would be comfortable for an outdoor informal wedding.  These are comfortable; however, I am disappointed with the fit.  I usually wear a 7.5. These are running small.  I didn't return them because I threw out the box thinking that they would fit.  I am still going to wear them, but am disappointed.  I would definitely order a half size up next time.  Everything else is what I expected."
4.0,fit well true to size
4.0,I love the light weight material and stretch of the fabric. These have become my favorite jammies
4.0,"Everything about this cap was perfect, except for the size. It did not fully cover my eyes."
4.0,True to size. The arms are a little tighter than what I thought they would be but I still love this dress. The ruffles are pretty and the top allows room for those of us that are blessed in the chest. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it
4.0,"These have an adaptive tint, so they get darker towards the top of the lens. The reading portion which is at the bottom more for wearing at the beach than for driving.  Pretty solid for rimless glasses. Comes with a case, cleaning clothe and a tool to tighten the arms."
4.0,The turtle is very cute.  Size I expected.  Arrived on time.  I could only give it 4 stars because the gold lines that highlight the shell are very faint not as shown in picture.
4.0,"Cute, Cute!"
4.0,I like the fabric and I will use them everyday wear.
4.0,I liked them they are very warm I used them on hands and arms I got a set of grey ones that only had one in it
4.0,Run slightly big but in a good way. Actually bought to wear for nursing since the cut makes it easy to take a boob out from the side. Very forgiving yet still form fitting and feminine. Feels great out it‚Äôs a nice soft jersey
4.0,"Great lenses, had to trim to fit the frames as these are for the half jacket 2.0‚Äôs  and I have the regular half jackets, but after trimming they were fine"
4.0,"I normally wear an xl in t-shirts abs like a 2xl in hoodies. I order the biggest size and its tight! Wish it fit better, it's super soft"
4.0,It is a vey nice product only dislike is that it was much larger than pictured. Other than that great product and has lasted a long time.
4.0,very good.<br />It has a good design compared to the price.
4.0,Does what is advertised.
4.0,"This is a nice dress.  The texture adds interest to the chevron pattern. I have many dresses in this brand, and I found this a bit snug at the bust and wide at the hip. The dress actually sticks out at the hip, about an inch on each side. It may not be obvious if you are moving about.<br />The dress is fully-lined."
4.0,"Very cute dress. VERY lightweight- was kinda put off by how Lightweight  it was. However, fit was completely on par (even though it looked REALLY TINY). Not see through inside, but I could definitely see potential for it outside on a sunny day.  Ordered size large (my usual), as I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô 8.5‚Äù tall and 155lbs."
4.0,Loved this dress! Fits great.
4.0,"4 stars because it was a bit small. I will still wear it because I like to wear different colors of berets. One size is supposed to fit all. My head is 24 inches around  the temples.I do love the color, it is almost like the photo, a nice dark burgundy."
4.0,GOOD FIT AND COMFORTABLE
4.0,"I little cheaper quality than expected. But for the price it's really good. Fits well, and I received compliments."
4.0,They're good. No complaints.
4.0,My husband really likes his slippers but they aren't very breathable and it makes his feet sweat a bit.
4.0,I like it but it kind of a btch to work with.
4.0,"4 stars because these gloves are nice & the price is right. Order a size larger as some may say I have small hands but I went with Medium & they fit just fine. They are snug & comfortable but when I put on Creative Comfort I realized these do not compare in materials used. They are nice & I'm wearing them now. They're just not the best. This type glove is hard to find. I'm still looking for a comfortable glove to use at the gun range without shelling out a ton! Yes, I cross stitch & shoot!"
4.0,A little tight at the top hard to get on and off foot. Felt like I'm stretching it out
4.0,I was a nice quality hoodie
4.0,Very pretty. Really liked. But I did not want to remove my otter box.  So I used as a gift
4.0,"Beautiful color and perfect fit. Very unique for plus-sized clothing.<br />For plus sized women who are trying to hide belly fat this is a perfect blouse.<br /><br />The side slits come up a little far, so an undershirt may be needed for those who do not want to randomly show skin when lifting arms!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I did not order multiples in my first order. I will certainly be looking for these in other colors in the future."
4.0,"Gotta admit when I ordered, I thought it was going to be a plastic  &#34;embroidery&#34;. I was wrong. Its actually like an embroidered patch. The pearls go far enough back. Its actually quite cute.<br />Pros:<br />Cute<br />Several pearls<br />Fits an average size 12/14 comfortably<br />Inexpensive<br />Fun Feature: It has slide hooks on each side for &#34; quick access&#34;üòè.<br /><br />Cons:<br />All you'll get is a comfortable &#34; rub&#34; (for lack of a better term)<br />The elastic with the pearls is a little weak.<br />The pearls can sometimes pinch....But honestly it was wasn't a constant, and it was more a &#34;well helloüòè&#34; than an ouchüò´! Lol!<br />Takes forever to get to you, but isn't it nice to get something fun in the mail along with the bills!?!<br /><br />Considering the pros , cons, and especially the price; would I order again??? Already did!"
4.0,"These socks are XXL, but be aware that they come up just a little past the ankle on someone who wears a size 10 shoe. The sock is somewhat thin, so we'll just have to see how well it holds up to multiple washing. Traction on the bottom seems to be effective. Good for spring and autumn, but you may need something thicker for winter. (They included a pair of ""metatarsal pads,"" but I don't know how those are supposed to be used.)"
4.0,"The earrings looks good , many compliments . if you are thinking of buying them , it's okay. I bought these last Christmas and they still look good ( so do I )."
4.0,This is a quality clasp with no movement or play.  I put in on a rubber b strap and it worked great.  It's very comfortable without any metal touching your wrist.  I prefer this over the butterfly clasps that I have used in the past.
4.0,This is a fairly well constructed hat that my somewhat picky son liked.  The white stitching on the black fabric gives it a nice touch and makes the hat more special.
4.0,"This dress is adorable! I saw a woman wearing it and asked where she got it...Amazon of course! I tend to be around an 8 in dresses these days and the M fits well. Small would have been too small and Large would have been too large. I'm deducting a star for the size of the arm holes. I feel a bit sausagey but could drop a few pounds anyway. The dress itself is stunning, I love the material and especially the length! I'm 5'6&#34; and the dress goes 2-3&#34; past my knees which is hard to find for me. And even better....no petticoat is required!!! The dress is so full and veluptuous. Love it! I already bought the black one too! Lovely dress, but be forewarned about having smallish arm holes."
4.0,Just as the way it shown on the picture.  Love it.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, and very soft. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the color is not at all what it shows online. It was supposed to be a plum-like purple, but it is much lighter."
4.0,"In this SPIbelt, my phone doesn't twist and stick out under my shirt during CrossFit. Keeps it flat."
4.0,So pretty and bright. I always get compliments
4.0,super cute. i'd order a size up.
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, but I was disappointed that Jupiter wasn‚Äôt included."
4.0,This dress is adorable! It fits perfectly and the material is beautiful and soft. It's very well made and can be dressed up or down for any occasion!
4.0,"A bit shiny overall, and the band around the chest is loose in a way that it looks old. Don't think I'll use the top but I love the bottoms! Definitely Brazilian & very decent quality."
4.0,I was entertained
4.0,My girl liked it very much !!
4.0,"I love this shirt! I bought it for a Disneyland trip and received a lot of compliments on it. It is a little thin so I would recommend wearing with a tank top or camisole. I always do anyways, so it wasn't an issue for me. I would recommend ordering a size up."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my 15 year old daughter. It is really pretty. The only issue is that the red &#34;military time&#34; on the inside is so tiny it can't really be seen.
4.0,"Happy, cheap, and have recieved a lot of compliments"
4.0,LOOKS GOOD WITH BLACK
4.0,"A bit short for me but I use it daily to carry around keys, credentials and stuff without having to fill my pockets or go around with a backpack."
4.0,"My daughter loves this dress. Say she had to wait until 2 returns and 3 shipments to get the right size. Still, it‚Äôs too big in her but she decided to keep it. I ordered first a 5T which looks for an 8 yo. Then a 4T looked exactly like the first one. I decided to go for a 3T which looks for a 5-6yo and soon will fit right. Other than that it‚Äôs beautiful and as shown in the pictures."
4.0,"Overall high quality and fits ok for the most part except for the breast cups, they were too lose and had some air in between your skin and the cups at times but over all very good and cute."
4.0,"I purchased this watch band to replace the leather strap in my 1.45&#34; ASUS ZenWatch 2. The material is beautiful and it fits perfectly. I was a bit concerned that the band might be too large for my small wrists (around 6&#34; around), but it fits well. Thus far, it has proven to be a comfortable fit. One commenter indicated that the metal was only polished on the outside; however, both sides are equally polished (attached a picture showing both inside and outside, side-by-side; they are indistinguishable). The band came with the tool required to install the band. Unfortunately, it did not come with instructions, and adjusting the width to be perfect is a bit tricky (hence taking off one star). Otherwise, I am pleased with the product and hope it stands up to the test of time.<br /><br />ETA: I‚Äôve now had this watch band for over a month and am still pleased as can be with it. Even though it was a bit awkward at first, I have gotten used to how to latch this band now. It still holds tightly, despite being taken off at least once a day."
4.0,"Love the print, materi√°l is good, but it runs small because my son is 8 months and I got him size 12 months and they just barely fit, and he weight is 19 lbs"
4.0,"This glove will work best when the temperature is between 10 and 40 degrees. It's an excellent glove for keeping your hands warm during much of the winter. I use them on my daily hour-long run. Keep in mind that your hand will sweat a bit, so it's important to have a slightly larger size glove. Too tight, then the sweat will make you uncomfortable. I've been running in the winter for 30 years. This is the best glove I've ever used in very cold weather. I recommend this glove."
4.0,My wife liked this top a lot except that it narrows down at the hips and was a little tighter.  She said it wasn't unwearable just a bit snug in the hips (the rest of the top fit very well and was proportioned well).  She liked the design and the fabric and said it was well made and didn't shrink in the wash.  She also said that the top looked small when she took it out f the package but that was an optical illusion created by the black and white pattern.  She wears this with a longer sweater and says she isn't as self conscious about the tighter hip area.
4.0,"These are great, the nose clip could hold a little better but for disposable I'm not complaining. They are cute too and can have a little fun with them."
4.0,It arrived in good shape.  Its a ni9ce necklace for the price.
4.0,Very comfy good quality.<br />But I noticed that the color fade after a few washes.
4.0,I would give 5* if they weren‚Äôt so flimsy
4.0,"I really like this but my issue is it runs a little on the smaller side. I'm usually a medium, but I ordered large just in case that too turned out to be small for me. The sleeves are fine in length but its a little tighter around the hips and waist because of which it becomes shorter in length too. Don't think its very proportional because if I sized up the sleeves would have been longer. The color is beautiful, the knit is alright. I don't think its very warm because the material is on the thinner side.<br />I'd still wear it because its pretty!"
4.0,"The costume looks authentic and is a better quality than your typical halloween store variety, however, I purchased the women's small and it was huge."
4.0,I use these caps  When I sleep.
4.0,"Comfortable, cool and doesn&#34;t shrink when you wash it."
4.0,"great support but had extension hooks to make it fit comfortable around. I would give 5 stars if the bra didnt need the attachable extension to fit me comfortably, otherwise great support and beautiful bra without the discomfort of wires. I would recommend or buy again and maybe sew the extension on, otherwise I keep losing it in the wash. Size retains well, I never throw bras into the dryer, only machine wash then air dry on hangers"
4.0,Beautiful earrings! I love the rose gold and the rainbow gems. Only 4 stars because the back squeezes the ear a little too tight ‚Äî my ear was a little sore at the end of the day
4.0,"The wallet is nicely crafted, supple and does appear to be real leather.  There are two hidden pockets behind the credit card slots, which was something that I had hoped would be there.  A nice bonus was two full size bill sections, as I was just expecting a single one.  Once filled, the wallet is fairly thick, but not overwhelmingly so.  I haven't tested the RFID protection, but if it works as advertised, then the wallet is all I had hoped for and more."
4.0,"These glasses are amazing! They look really expensive. My husband swears to only wear rayban but I bought him these and he loves them! The only problem I have is a part of the red arm ear hook was snagged and peeled off. It's a small spot now, but after some wear, it will probably just continue to peel away. So I'm disappointed about that. It makes the glasses look bad."
4.0,Good product... it's a little bulky for me only because I was looking to use it for adult basketball league
4.0,These are cool...they get frayed kind of easy after washing but they are really cute and soft. I use them mostly for the gymz
4.0,It looks and fits good. It is costume like quality buy good for the cost.
4.0,good quality and water resistant/proof - would have been 5 stars but for the fit - the smaller size would have been to small
4.0,The dress fits somewhat snug compared to other brand dresses of the same size‚Äîespecially on the sleeve.  The material is comfortable and breathable.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt give the dress five stars is that the sleeves could‚Äôve used reinforcement to make the puff look more shapely.  The hem falls below the knee for me‚ÄîI am 5‚Äô7/5‚Äô8.  The blue dress is a dark navy.  I have worn this dress twice already and have received compliments.
4.0,"Fit was as expected and overall the dress is cute in shape, pattern, and length, but I may end up returning it for two reasons:<br />1. The lighter part of the dress is darker than it appears - it's more of a cream, definitely darker than Ivory. A lighter color would make it look more crisp but as is it's a bit drab IMO.<br />2. I barely touched the dress and one of the buttons fell off. This could easily be sewn back on, but it's not ideal to have to do this before even wearing it."
4.0,Perfect fit for 20mm band watches. Does NOT include the all black band only the 3 dual colors seen in pic which is why only 4 stars.
4.0,"These are great quality and feel soft, but my 4-year-old daughter does complain that they slide down somewhat often."
4.0,"I ordered a Large. I am 5'7"" 150 pounds. I gave it to my 6'2"" 190 pound husband. Hahaha, it fit him great. Swallowed me."
4.0,"It works great, the only problem is that the size is as I was buying a large for children and nit an adult man."
4.0,Wife loves wearing it.
4.0,"Cool glasses. I did order twice and the gold is not gold, more of a smoky brown mirror. They do look cool, keep in mind they are not polarized and the way they fit, well on my eyes, they don't cover from the sun, so I do squint. But I do like them."
4.0,I ordered a large. It covered well in the back but barely covered in the front. It fits more like a shirt. I plan on wearing it with a pair of black liquid pants. It is beautiful either way a dress or shirt!! I love it.
4.0,Love this dress BUT I‚Äôm confused? Why is the slip way bigger than the dress? The dress part fits like a glove but when I try to put it on over the slip the slip falls down because it‚Äôs SO loose. I don‚Äôt know if someone else had previously worn the slip or not but something is off.
4.0,"The breast area is small, but the free is true to size. The dress is long enough for some one 5‚Äô9‚Äù to 5‚Äô12. Pretty dress with lace up back so it has extra room if you need it."
4.0,My daughter loved this and was so excited to put it in her garage.
4.0,I really like this bag which I'm using for a summer purse. If the lining were a lighter color it would be even better!
4.0,"I have never had knit loungewear before, so when I saw this I had to try it.¬† I was shocked at how comfy cozy it was! I ordered the XXL in Dark Grey.¬† I think ¬†loungewear should be a little oversized, so I am happy with the fit ‚Äì although on me the pants are a bit too long.¬† If I roll the waste the length is a little better. I wore these one day when I was feeling a bit under the weather, and I have to say it is a very comfortable outfit. I felt cozy and not overly warm. I am curious to see how this will wash. Based on what I know now, I would recommend this item."
4.0,"Nice hat, good quality for price.  Brim of hat has a wire going it through it for adjustment.  Wasn't thrilled with the color of the ribbon (dark brown) but looks easy enough to remove.  Overall I think it will be a good beach hat."
4.0,"This is a good look and easy swap out if you are trying to color match an outfit for the day.  I would not say this is a field band as it is thin.  However, for an office or simple work it is fine.  and being thin is good because there is absolutely no break in time for comfort.  I am running a Sieko SKX007 on this band and it looks amazing.  i will get another one in a different color.  You cannot beat the price for leather and the shipping was fast."
4.0,These were great for my Winnie the Pooh loving friend! The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that it was difficult to make the bracelet smaller.
4.0,"Nice stockings. Loved the color. Would have gave it a 5 star except when my daughter wore them for Halloween, she came home with a large hole in them."
4.0,I love these as the do stay on and hide under my converse but the length is a bit short for my size 8 feet
4.0,"I got the navy blue for my husband, the color is as pictured. Came longer than expected both the sleeves and the overall length. Not as soft as I'd hoped but overall the quality is good."
4.0,Nicely made and lightweight adjusts at the bottom and has elastic sleeves. Pocket entry is covered so they don‚Äôt get water in them. Fits nicely in the pouch. Perfect for summer camp!
4.0,"I bought this dress for a funeral. Arrived in good time. I'm 5, 0' about 120lbs a little fat in ny midsection, however the coat fit perfectly. The inside dress fit like a blouse so i had to switch it out with something that I already have. I'm a 36B cup and the inside piece had no extra room. Fits exactly like a blouse. Cannot be worn as dress. The material didn't feel nor look cheap."
4.0,"Love the dress,  however  I had to get it hemmed  which made the dress more  expensive. I'm  5'4"
4.0,pretty good & very thin
4.0,I like the fabric of these pants. It‚Äôs very comfortable and stylish at the same time.
4.0,I love this dress but I thought it would be more of a cotton material and it's more of a silky material very stretchy and it also fits a little big so I would go a size down from your normal dress size.
4.0,its perfect for the price. I'm a size 2 regularly and it fits a little loose (what i wanted). the capped sleeves are a bit small on my broad shoulders but it'll work for a Halloween costume.
4.0,I got it first my grandson.  He loved it.  But the colors are not staying as good as I thought they should.
4.0,These are definitely made for teenagers and younger people. If you have any kind of boots order a whole size up.
4.0,"I bought this for a flapper themed party and loved it. Felt like it was flattering and it moved really well. It also made my bosom look larger than it actually was, I'll take it, LOL. Be aware that the material is thin but for what you pay, it's worth it."
4.0,Good. But I wish they were longer.
4.0,"CUTE<br />SPARKLY<br />CHEAP<br />dupe for TOMS<br />wearable for shorts, skirts, jeans,yoga pants, leggings; everything<br />if u can't afford Toms,get these<br />if u like it a lot keep them or buy the real toms"
4.0,Though rough on my wrist my niece treasured it for the sparle !
4.0,"I ordered these last month, and they really are great leggings, but i ordered a size too small and was too lazy to take them back.  Which is MY bad, not theirs.  SO! If you are wanting to buy these, BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER, unless you're like really, really tiny.  I am pretty small and fairly tall - five feet, eight inches, 125 pounds - and i ordered a small, they are an ok length for me, but VERY tight.  But, even with a size small, they are okay, and pretty good material.  Not my fav, thats for sure, but still good, and comfortable. I like the softer inside lining.  I'm keeping mine, but I wish they were a little looser toward the top, because they flatten any kind of booty that one may have - and i looove my booty, haha.  Medium would have been PERFECT.  I like tight, but this is just impossible d: Order a size bigger, i PROMISE you will want to."
4.0,"Based on the size chart, I initially ordered a size medium.  I couldn't even get it zipped up.  The material was so pretty that I decided to try a size large.  The large just fit in the waist, and it hits about mid-calf.  For reference I am 5'1"", 116 lbs.  It's a really cute skirt, and I can't wait for summer and warm weather so I can wear it!!  Shipped and arrived pretty quickly."
4.0,I'm a really small person. I'm talking 00-0 small. I ordered a size small and the bottoms were tiny. I'll be buying other bottoms to go with the top. The top fits great and seems to be of good quality.
4.0,"super cute! it falls apart pretty easily and isn't very sturdy, but is a great piece for the price."
4.0,"Looks and feels great! Only complaint is that the sash is shorter than pictured and comes undone easily no matter how tight you try to tie it. Length was pefect- right at the knees (I'm 5' 9""). If you are small busted you may want to go down a size. I am a 38H and top area was slightly loose."
4.0,Hard to unpeel.
4.0,"I'm 5ft tall and around 150lbs. I got a large and it seems to fit good! The shorts are a little tight at the hem, but not too bad. The length is good, too, which I was afraid of since I'm so short. The material gets kind of wrinkly, but I think it'll be fine."
4.0,"Love it. Great price. But not truly red. It was brown with a red tint, like a mahogany color."
4.0,"The material is thin but so far very durable. I'm not worried it's going to rip when putting them on. A couple of times I've snagged then on something with zero blemishes. The thong cut is not really like a scrunch but it does accent my bum nicely. More so than  regular leggings would. Wish there where more colors, but for now I'm happy with what I have."
4.0,Really cute pajamas.  My grandsons will love them.
4.0,"Just not for me-I‚Äôm a short, athletic build and these were just not flattering. I love the fabric, love the pattern, love the pockets, but the fit is for a different shaped body than mine. I‚Äôm 5ft 3, 140lbs and ordered a medium. They fit perfect"
4.0,"This suit has a flattering style. It fits perfectly! I wanted a chlorine resistant swimsuit to wear to my water aerobics class as the suit I was wearing had almost completely faded. I ordered the Mykonos blue. Very nice color. I will also wear it in the pool while on vacation, too! I wish there was a underwire version and then it would get 5 stars. I plan to order at least one more."
4.0,"The bracelet is nice. Fits my arm a little funny, so I will be giving it as a gift. Good price."
4.0,This romper definitely runs a little large and the material has a silky feel to it which I did not expect. However it is very cute.
4.0,Really pretty but very small. Would be perfect for  5-12  year old girls may be. Delivered quite soon.
4.0,The fabric is very soft and fits comfortably!
4.0,Pretty and comfortable however I wear a 36 D and this 36 D band was tight. I can get by but would have been much more comfortable with a size up.
4.0,"I absolutely love it, but the string that ties was yellow, not nude. that was awkward. The shirt itself was very cute though. Wore it to Vegas."
4.0,"These cotton briefs are very well made, soft and durable but they run very small.  Luckily for me I put on some weight over the past months so I upped a couple of sizes.  Now I have lost some of that weight and these fit.  So if I had gotten my regular size they would run way too small.  I recommend them.  They look great when you get the right size."
4.0,"Lovely color & just great for fall weather. The fabric is quality material & the stitchings well made. Would have given a 5, but the sleeves were a tad too wide."
4.0,The jacket was a gift for my granddaughter
4.0,Jacket was vacuum sealed and in new condition as expected. Delivery was on time. Would recommend to others.
4.0,Not for peeps with a belly (laughing).  I need to lose weight.
4.0,"Not the highest quality but comfortable, flattering fit, and cute. I got lots of compliments the first time I wore it. Material does not flex for breath too well. The zipper goes far down the back but it can be a little tricky to get on and off. I bought xsmall, I'm 5'4&#34; 120lbs"
4.0,Great top though I probably should have gone with a medium.  It fits pretty snug.
4.0,Great hat just needs to be broken in and it should be solid for a long time. My husband was so happy that I found this to replace his last one that he lost.
4.0,"When I first ordered this I ordered a medium and it was much too small. I contacted the sellers who were very helpful and I was able to change for a large.  This dress is constructed well however the chest area was still a bit tight. I had to wear a slip under it as it was a bit see through.  For reference I am 5ft 9‚Äù and 155lbs maybe an xl would work better but may need a bit of adjusting at the waist. I got many compliments, all in all it‚Äôs a great dress."
4.0,The dress is really nice good quality but the top part is a bit big only thing I didn't like I order a large I'm 5'1 145 pounds
4.0,"Regardless of metal used to construct it, I recommend periodically oiling the hauberk and never wearing it bare chested. Stainless doesn't mean rust proof. Put a sweater, arming jacket or gambeson on under it, because chainmail will grab and tear out any body hair present, no matter how fine it is. Don't expect a modern reproduction to not shed rings unless the rings have been riveted or, more likely, welded which takes time and effort."
4.0,"I think the cloth is nice and probably will work, no real instruction, but I am not good with this type item.  It did not shine my stainless watch band, the shiny type. (Breitlin Watch) as I had hoped."
4.0,"They seem pretty well made and just like the picture, but they smelled really bad when I opened them."
4.0,"They fit really good. It is very hard for me to find shades that fit or should I say look like they fit lol. I have a large frame and for me to find glasses is either a really big pain or costly but these were easy on both, well worth the money the only problem was the temple arms are a little short but hey they cover my eyes."
4.0,"These boots are great. They fit a little tight at first, however, they aren't too small. I think it is just the inside lining that is thick and I assume it will loosen as they are worn.  My only personal dislike of them is when I take a step the boot widens at the bottom.  *This is only a personal thing and it does not affect the shoe at all.* I was just thinking they would keep their shape when walking but it flexible on the sides of the shoe.  If that doesn't make any sense ignore it :)"
4.0,Fits very comfortably. A little loose in the bust (I am 36C) and does not have support but does come with padded cup inserts. Would like for the straps to be sturdier/more supportive. The material is very soft and it's comfortable to wear. Appears opaque.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product in exchange for my review.
4.0,I wish ordered one size small.
4.0,"The shirt is good quality, however I anticipated a more fitted shirt and less in length. Overall, not bad, perhaps some modifications to the sizing chart, but not a bad quality of fabric which is good."
4.0,Pants fit a bit larger than I expected but allow you to have room for extreme maneuvers and provide excellent protection and comfort. I would definitely recommend this product to another individual.
4.0,I like this bracelet but it fits a bit tight. I'm bony wristed female adult (5'6&#34; under 130lbs) and the bracelet is snug. I wish it had one or two more beads. Then it would be perfect.<br />Also one of the charms is different than the photo. But that's no big thing to me.
4.0,Didn't realize the shoulders were puffy.
4.0,This flipflop provides good support for feet. It is certainly bigger than regular size. Make sure to order one size less than regular wear.
4.0,Nice ..very nice
4.0,Awesome 360 3 pack briefs are mostly polyester with some cotton (70/30 blend). This is an all black set specifically medium 32-34.‚Äù  Come tagfree &  individually bound in package.<br /><br />They  are well made and durable enough hold up in machine washings so far.<br /><br /> They seem to run a bit small but a like the leg length design on them.
4.0,Pants fit well and are good quality.
4.0,Difficult to flatter any figure but very comfortable and flowy
4.0,It looked awesome... I should be fitter though... it really hugs so you want your lower bod to be ready for that.
4.0,"I normally wear Medium sizes of tops, cardigans, jackets, etc. But I got a Medium and it was very large and baggy on me. I had to wash and dry it several times for it to start fitting a bit better for me to wear."
4.0,"Fits pretty true to size. Although I'm bottom heavy, it still fits pretty comfortable"
4.0,Loved this watch but the strap broke within a year which is a shame as it was working flawlessly. Cant complain too much because its soooo cheap but I dont like just throwing stuff away that still works.
4.0,"is very nice just what you see.Only the part with the color is not finish  even with the rest of the dress,maybe is on purpose but i don't like it."
4.0,Seems durable.
4.0,"They are super soft, and fit my legs great... unfortunately around the butt/lower stomach/waist they are an awkward fit. They don't quite fit over my butt so the back of the waist band goes down into a V, and they are very loose with no compression around the lower stomach, with a high/soft waist band that essentially over exaggerates any lower stomach pooch you may have. I am not in particularly bad shape, but even so I would probably not wear these again with anything that isn't loose over that part of my body. They are very warm and comfortable though. I just don't know many women that want compression in the legs and a saggy lower stomach together. Also, the waist band is so soft that it can bunch up a bit after sitting for a while, and if you wear them with a snug top then that can show. Overall I love them, but I will need to order another pair of black leggings with more stomach compression for wearing with tops that don't hide the lower stomach."
4.0,Lightweight summer dress thin fabric
4.0,"This sweatshirt is exactly what I expected. It fits perfect, is made of good quality fabric and the design is beautiful just as in the picture.  I bought this a s a gift and was very satisfied."
4.0,"If I were younger, I'd probably really like these. However, the neon-green stitching led me to return these. Therefore, be warned, these seem to be targeted towards a teenage demographic. If you're a bit older, you may want to think twice, depending on your style. Quality wise, these are a great value, hence the relatively high rating despite me returning them. You will not fool anyone into thinking these are $200 jeans, but they are superior to many knock-offs and discount-store class jeans."
4.0,"I'm normally a 10.5 or 11, but these 11 were way too small I had to return them."
4.0,"Ordering a size bigger isn't a bad idea with this product, especially with a growing kid. Otherwise it is a great shirt."
4.0,Socks are a nice quality. I bought 2 sets of these for two different granddaughters. The youngest is short for her age and these are the first knee high socks that didn't fit like an adult sock on her. She loves them. My other granddaughter hasn't worn hers yet so I'm not sure how they will fit her yet.
4.0,"Lovely fit. Looks good. Nice weight. I ironed it before packing for a trip. It wrinkled, but it still looked good when I put it on. Color is exact. It's a nice weight. Easy to wear. Comfortable and good fit. You can dress it up with accessories or casual."
4.0,"We love the ring!  I deducted a star because the sizes don't appear to be the same as standard sizing.  We went to a jewelry store and were sized at a size 10, however, the 10 that we ordered initially was too big.  We ordered a 9.5 and it fit just fine."
4.0,"Super comfortable!  I ordered the purple romper, however, it's not the purple color as listed in the product description. As you can tell from my photo, it is more of a raspberry color. Romper on the left compared to another dress of mine in purple  on the right - you can clearly tell the romper is NOT purple. I still love it and will keep it, but be warned if purchasing.  I give 4 stars for the comfort and fit but left off one star due to color variance."
4.0,"I wish the glass itself was easier to clean. It looks great on, but it's plastic lenses."
4.0,The fit was a little odd but the material is nice.  Used it as part of a Halloween costume so for the price it was fine.
4.0,"Wish they were UV 400,  GOOD  BUY!!"
4.0,"Cute summer outfit, slightly big, but adjustable straps."
4.0,Super cute! This dress is actually made so much better than I had expected. It‚Äôs very comfy. It fits pretty true to size (if anything it‚Äôs made a little big). I love it! It is long but after you tie a knot at the bottom it‚Äôs perfect!
4.0,"Like the fabric, colors and style of the dress but the cap sleeves are not my favorite."
4.0,Love this! Super comfortable. 4 stars because the zipper busted open once but was easy to unzip and fix.
4.0,It fit but I could have sized down for a better fit
4.0,Pretty charms add decent quality
4.0,Wrinkles easily but otherwise great!
4.0,Have not worn them yet but they fit well (got the medium). They are not baggy but more fitted.  So far so good.
4.0,It flares out more than I like and the fabric is too thick
4.0,Decent amount of padding. Sizing was spot on.
4.0,It is pretty and fits my pinky finger just fine.
4.0,I love this necklace. It looks really great with a low cut shirt. I gave 4 stars because the necklace really irritated my skin as a result of wearing it in the heat. I still plan to get the red one.
4.0,"Very pretty and good quality, but the medium was a bit larger on me than I expected."
4.0,Beautiful dress but too short waisted for me..I'm 5'8&#34; and long waisted.
4.0,"I'm a 38D, so I thought I'd take a shot and maybe I could just feel extra compressed with the large. No beans. I plead with the manufacturers to offer some bigger sizes! This is the only bra I've been able to find that has a zip front and also has a phone pocket! These are the features I need!"
4.0,"A little heavy says my wife, she keeps the triangle inside bc it snags on everything"
4.0,Cute cover up I got for Mexico. But for someone who usually wears a XS or small it's big. Tends to go off the shoulder.
4.0,"They are adorable.  A little tight for a long foot tho. 9.5.  If you are any longer don't buy.  If they had an option for a larger size, would be perfect."
4.0,Nice but was expecting the chain link to be silver not gold. Completely threw off my outfit.
4.0,"Really cute. I got the flower screwed on pretty easily, which was no simple feat as its quite small! Of course, it's cheap so the little diamonds eventually turned green but I'm unconcerned. Works well!"
4.0,Comfortable and cute for my 9 year old.  I like that it has little cap sleeves.
4.0,"Ordered an extra large, it fits well, slightly big.  My daughter likes that it has pockets.  She is only 5 ft so it comes down to her knees, which is a little longer.  But all in all a cute dress with a nice fit."
4.0,I got so earrings and not others. I didn't get rainbows but i got beer earrings ? i did get all 19 but what do i do with beer earrings?
4.0,Not bad for 9$. Looks as expected.
4.0,"Love the gloves, but they don't work very well for the phones."
4.0,"Like these a lot. Really comfortable, however the string to keep them higher up on legs doesn't stay put and they wrinkle easily but they do dry really fast which is Awesome and are really comfy, almost like jammy pants comfy."
4.0,"Warm, big, brown bulky comfort!  If you want something thinner, select another Isotoner style. These gloves will be a welcomed comfort once Winter kicks in."
4.0,"I love this dress! Doesn't have to be ironed, and I can wear it to work. I'm usually a 12/14 or an XL in US dress sizes (my measurements for reference - bust: 42&#34;, waist: 36&#34;, hips: 49&#34;). According to the chart in the image description, I fall into the XXL size - but I figured since the material stretches, I'll order a size down. Glad I did!<br /><br />I probably could have ordered an L, but I like that this fits without warping the lines or showing every lump. The construction is decent, though I'm a little peeved at the uneven stripe just above the front waistline on one side. Otherwise, the skirt ends right at my knee, and the waist falls just above my natural waist - if you're less busty, that's likely where it would sit."
4.0,"Really cute tiny crossbody bag!  Holds cell phone, cards/cash, lipstick and comb easily!"
4.0,"Super warm unless you get even slightly wet in which case, they dont help at all"
4.0,Very nice and comfortable. Almost slimming. Sleeves are just long enough. Not baggy like sweater sleeves often are
4.0,"Fits well, nice and warm. Hood and pockets could be a little bigger. Hard to find zipper open hoodies these days"
4.0,This is a keepsake to remind me of RBG's contributions to law and order as well as being an active supporter of woman's civil rights.<br /><br />I'd like there to be an RGB Day of Remembrance every year where women across the country and maybe around the world wear a replica of her famous necklace.
4.0,"Feel like a rockstar wearing them, but they won't last.  Will buy again once these wear out."
4.0,"If you order 2 sizes up, it will fit good but tight. If you want it loose go 3 up. I'm 59, curvy hourglass. I'm normally a L but ordered the XXL and it was perfect. I wore it for a halloween costume buy everyone complimented it and asked where to buy!"
4.0,The necklace was beautiful.  My wife really liked it.  (Remember that the circle is a symbol of never-ending love.)  The chain was a little smaller than ideal.  But still beautiful.
4.0,Every cool watch. If you buy this watch just to wear it . I strongely advise .
4.0,"I really like this dress. It fit well, great shape, good color (on me anyway). Waist was actually a tad loose, but that's what the tie is for.  It washed like a dream the first time, MW cold, tumbled dry. Considering the price, I have no idea how well it will hold up, but it's certainly well worth it so far."
4.0,Very pretty ring especially for the price. I've gotten compliments each time I've worn it.
4.0,"The cuff is made of good quality silver, is a great size and has great proportions. It looks good anywhere, high or low on your ear.  My one complaint is that the cuff bends sort of unevenly when I pressed it to make it fit to my ear better.  You can't really see the unevenness when it's on, but it makes it difficult to get on and off, and I worry that after a while of having to bend and unbend it will get permanently warped."
4.0,Cute dress for the price. I ordered a M and it was a little bit too big. Would order again
4.0,"Great for everyday use.  Spacious enough for wallet, cell phone and glasses."
4.0,The jacket is lightweight and fits as expected.  Looks good for an easy costume.  I was a bit surprised that the pink lady writing on the back is not just plain black but also bedazzled with pink rhinestones.  I would have preferred it be just the black as it kind of looks like I went a little wild with a glue gun.  Overall good costume for the price.
4.0,Super cute and simple watch. Looks exactly like the picture. The only minus is that the belt is pretty stiff. Otherwise perfect and fancy
4.0,I tried it and it fits as expected. Wash in gentle cycle and lay flat to dry.
4.0,The graphic is great. Shirt is Crew neck. Fits as expected. Normal quality shirt
4.0,Loved this dress but shrunk after washing.  Did not put in dryer but still shrink in cold water wash.
4.0,Vert pretty.... good quality...good price
4.0,"These sunglasses took a long time to ship from Hong Kong, but for the price you can't beat it.  They are quite nice quality and they look great on me, I can tell because I can still wear my prescription glasses under them.  WIN!"
4.0,Cute cotton dress! Would buy again.
4.0,continuous use
4.0,"Fits well, keeps you warm as decent material is used!"
4.0,Pretty cool glasses.  Don't really recommend at night.  I tried it because some people says they help with night light glare but they seemed too dark to keep on.
4.0,Were a little small but beautifully designed!
4.0,"Nice material, but the wrists and waist band is a tad tight. Something you‚Äôll have to stretch out."
4.0,"It‚Äôs tight and loose in some areas. I have an hourglass shape and this rides up thick thighs. I‚Äôm constantly having to pull it down so I don‚Äôt accidentally flash anyone (needs to be worn with wear spanx for sure). I have the straps tied too tight in the first pic. Once I adjusted it, it fit right under my breasts instead of cutting them off like in the last pic."
4.0,super cute. I reserve the one star to see how long it will last
4.0,"Light,  good  customer service"
4.0,"They sure are pretty! A lit heavier than I expected it to be but not uncomfortable. Really shiny and they have this antique look to them. Only 4 stars because they didn't come with backings. And because the wings have some weight to it, it could slide off easily. I put backings on from other earrings I already had but none fit right or will stop it much from sliding off. Here's to hoping they don't!"
4.0,"A little shorter in length than pictured. A bit thinner than expected, but still cute."
4.0,"Very cute for little girls, great price too!"
4.0,"Luckily, I love giant shirts and that was exactly what I was in the market for! However, I wouldn‚Äôt order a size up as they‚Äôre absolutely gigantic. The material isn‚Äôt great and feels like those cheap silky costumes. The product is also extremely thin. Despite this, the color quality is phenomenal and it‚Äôs become a favorite shirt of mine."
4.0,"Good quality, got here earlier than expected and comes in a cute baggy in small, separate baggies. Clickers are easy to click and unsnap even after being in the nose or wherever, but won't fall out. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because you cant wear the pretty ones very long or they turn your nose a little green.<br />Other than that I'm really satisfied. Looks like they do in the picture"
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and the material is sturdy.
4.0,I bought these glasses for a 90's party. It was great in that atmosphere.
4.0,for the price a nice selection
4.0,These are very warm and the material is very nice.
4.0,"These were adorable and pretty nice quality for the price.  The fabric was super soft and stretchy!  Sadly, I had to return them because they were were too long for my daughter and they only come in one size."
4.0,Very nice piece ..my wife loves it ..hopefully it keeps her lucky
4.0,"Great belt,  this is my first rachet belt, and I really like it"
4.0,Perfect for workouts and for casual wear.
4.0,"Pretty much what I expected for the price. My children play outside in the cool Alaskan air all summer and constantly lose their hats. They do run small and they're on the thin side for an actual winter hat. As they're supposedly men's hats, I was expecting them to be larger but since they were for the littles anyway, the sizing wasn't really a problem for us."
4.0,I am a 34 and the medium didnt fit as the chart suggested so try higher on size I suggest. Found out that returning these to Canada costs about what I paid so I contacted the seller and they refunded me pretty quickly so I updated my frustrating experience to positive and ill just give the shorts to one of the kids in the family.
4.0,I like it but fits small.
4.0,Nice dress. Large was to big. Dress is cut big
4.0,"It‚Äôs a nice little apron that with a few changes would become a wonderful apron.  The ties need to be changed, I‚Äôm a plus size and I barely have enough to put a little tie at the end!  The neck tie is Long enough but it being so skinny it hurts my neck after working with my plants for awhile!  Now if you did a total redesign so you did the shoulders like the Japanese aprons (that I love )I would buy a new one for sure even at a greater price!"
4.0,"Took a month to ship, but they were cheap snd they look nice. A great one-off, if nothing else."
4.0,"These glasses are the same brand, style, and price available at Wal-Mart. I wear them to run. They are light and stick well to my head even when I sweat.  However they aren't perfect. The lenses fit pretty loosely in the frame, and they have fallen out a few times.  The rubber on the earpiece also began to fall off after a few weeks, I glued it back in and have had no problems since."
4.0,"Okay, so this is PHENOMENAL! I love it so much. I live in the Northeast. Cold all the time. This is a perfect house coat that I can toss on when I just want to walk around my house in my underwear. The only complaint is that there were some loose threads on the edge of the hoodie that took me only 10 minutes to trim up. That is why it only gets four stars. Other than that, fit is amazing, comfortable & warm. I recommend this product without reservations."
4.0,"Great suit. I think it runs just a little big, but that could be I'm not as large in the breast area. :)  Otherwise,  it fits terrific and it looks great.  I'm very satisfied and would buy again from this seller."
4.0,"I have smallish hands and these just fit, so I'm not sure they'd work on someone with longer fingers. They're feminine without being too girly and warm without being too bulky. The touchscreen tips worked pretty well and I loved how discreet they are as opposed to the very obvious ones made of bright metallic material. I just wish the trim and bow was less tan and more cream. But overall,  happy with them and I'd definitely purchase them again in another color."
4.0,"They do shrink so I ordered the next size up!!!! But other wise they are great, very comfy and easy to wear!!"
4.0,Fits great.  It could use a little more compression for those of us who are a little chubby.  Color is excellent.  Length is a little long for those of us that are short hit right above the knee.  I like them a lot though and would buy again
4.0,"I love this dress!  the colors are gorgeous, the style is simple and breezy. the fit is not consistent.  I wear a large in all brands, and have other dresses by milumia that fit fine in a large.  however, this one was a little snug.  since the fabric is crinkle, I ironed it to stretch it out sideways a little so it isn't so snug on my hips and belly.  this manufacturer needs to be more consistent with sizing. the only reason I didn't return it and reorder XL is that they were out of this in black, and didn't want a white one.  I hope that when I wash it, it doesn't shrink so much that it no longer fits. I plan to wash in cold, hang to dry, and stretch out with iron if needed."
4.0,"I ordered this Zeagoo women‚Äôs white sexy tank top for my wife and she says that she likes it a lot. She does like the V- neck design, the Spaghetti straps and the racerback styling. My wife says that it fits her pretty well and true to size for her and that it is very comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off. She likes that the shirt was made with materials made of 95% rayon and 5% spandex, and it seems to be of good quality, and durable. My wife loves to wear this tank top because it's breathable, lightweight and comfortable. She often wears this camisole blouse with long sleeves over it when it gets cooler or shorts during warm weather. She likes how flattering this sleeveless T- shirt top is, and she says it is simply cute, flowy and elegant. For the quality, and price point, it is a great value for money. I would definitely recommend it."
4.0,"I like the fabric, I like having some texture. This does run big, though."
4.0,"Material could have been nicer for that price,"
4.0,It was amazing! Just one thing is is that it only came with one and not five. But I loved it sm!
4.0,"Love the scarf (soft, trunks up)! Only issue it's very thin and i'm concerned that if it's snagged it will be ruined due to the weight of the fabric."
4.0,Ok so these are wayyyyyyyyy smaller then my normal guage eyebrow barbell plus the bars are super short. The whole thing is wayyy smaller then my normal eyebrow ring. I was confused at first thinking how is this gonna fit ü§£ü§£ pun intended ladies. Well it fits but they are absolutely plated ladies. I will most definitely have to buy some normal stainless steel ones! The black ones most definitely are plated ladies. Otherwise they are gorgeous.
4.0,It fit great but was a tad small around the arms
4.0,I like them as a subtle reference to Dr. Who but could also be seen by others as just angels.
4.0,"Very small slim and light. This is a great second wallet, in my opinion best suited for travel or even for maybe a night out on the town. Any place or time you just want to carry a single credit card or 2, a bit of cash and ID like a business trip or your in a position to maybe drink too much and you want to keep your minimal possessions close to the breast. I was in a restaurant recently and was watching what appeared to be a reality tv show from a foreign land and I could tell through the subtitles that it was about  a police task force dealing with huge gangs of teenage<br />pickpockets. Put this wallet in a t-shirt under a pullover or button down and I know I'd feel a lot safer in a situation like that. My only pet peeve with this particular wallet is that the outermost credit card sleeve doesn't allow the card to sit deep enough to allow for 3 easily assessable cards as the pic shows,one card ends up sitting above the other, making it a pain to get to the card in the back."
4.0,This necklace has become one of my favorites. It can be worn dressy or just for fun. It's the perfect size and weight.
4.0,Great top. Very thin fabric. Must be worn with a camisole.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 160 Pounds. They fit great! Just the right amount of stretch and long enough for my height, which is a challenge sometimes.<br /><br />The only thing I didn‚Äôt like (I‚Äôm not sure if it was explained in the description) was that the front pockets are not real. I like having front pockets and back ones, but it won‚Äôt keep me from enjoying them (:"
4.0,Love this top.  Fits well .....and looks good!!
4.0,"The applicae of roses is beautiful, but for me the top is a bit short and the not crazy about the material."
4.0,"I usually wear a size 8.5. I got a size 9 and they feel snug around the sides yet I have narrow feet. Could use a bit more cusioning in the heels. Otherwise, they're very nice."
4.0,Product came timely and exactly as described have not yet put on bike since<br />Xmas gift.
4.0,"The one and only negative is that I have incredibly tiny wrists, so it is a little big and the golden snitch arms are a little wide for my wrist size. Other than that, the bracelet is absolutely perfect for any harry Potter fan. All of my friends love it! Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Both pairs of these arrived with no damage, broken parts, nor did they need any minor repairs.  They are each packaged in there own boxes.  They are very long when worn and both pairs have the open hook backs.  I had no ear lobe swelling, no tarnish marks, or no irritations when wearing.  The weight is pretty light for a longer earring and after about 8 hours I was happy to take them out."
4.0,Awesome and cheap.
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but it does stretch. Fair quality for the price."
4.0,got these for my husband who broke his femur and was non weight bearing for 6 weeks.  He wears a size 14 shoe.  These did fit him but most of the sock went for his foot and not much went past the ankle.  Biggest thing is they worked!
4.0,"Comes as pictured. The collar was perfect, but I wish the cuffs were adjustable. They definitely slid out of place a bunch of times. Other than great for playboy bunny costume :)"
4.0,"These were very cute. The straps for the kid dress were a little too long, and the length on the mom dress was too short (maybe just because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù), but they were adorable for photos."
4.0,"I expected this to be very similar to the degrees 180s earmuffs that I found before. However I was a little disappointed that they do not fold with the same mechanism as the 180s. These seem to have an internal wire structure that just twists but does not have the internal hinges and sliding mechanism that the 180s have, so they are not as compact when folded. For the money these seem to be quite a deal, however, the 180s are higher-quality and therefore warrant the higher price.<br /><br />If you tend to lose these often then perhaps this is a good option.<br /><br />I will go ahead and give this four stars because of the price compared to what you get."
4.0,Comfortable with moderate + support
4.0,"It was super cute and if I ever had somewhere to wear it, I could then justify the purchase.  I feared it would hang in the closet waiting for that special night out to happen and it never would."
4.0,My daughter is slim so this fits a bit loose but a little adjustment and it fits and works well
4.0,Ordered two: 22 in fit perfectly...connectors included with 24 in band were too short to attach band to watch
4.0,"I'm not sure why the other reviews are so negative, I ordered the yellow version and it works on my watch just fine, I can adjust the band retention clip, I see no issues with this as a 1/5th the cost copy of the Apple original.. no, you won't be getting titanium parts, and I suppose they could have used more of a brushed metal finish to make it match the Titanium but.. that's a relatively minor detail to me at least. It works, costs a whole lot less, and looks good. I give it 4/5 stars, only docking one star for not doing a bit more on the brushed metal look, but functionally it is just fine."
4.0,"Wore this for a Halloween themed wedding. Me and my family went as the Addams family. It fit well and the only problem I had throughout the night was that the little clip to keep the collar tight in the back was sticking out and poking the back of my neck, which could have just been my dress not a normal thing."
4.0,This vest is more like a cut off jacket then a vest. Good fit and quality
4.0,Nice PJ. Just make sure to wash before wearing to avoid all the fuzzies on the undershirt.
4.0,This item fits as suggested and I wear it all the time. Excellent item.
4.0,"They work well, and they're more sturdy than I expected."
4.0,The necklaces arrived quickly and are very nice.
4.0,Cute little dress. Seems a bit clingy. It's shorter than I had hoped so I'll use is as a swimsuit cover for cruising.
4.0,I likef the dress but I didn't get my belt with it ...
4.0,"I have chunky ""Oprah"" arms. Usually arm warmers end up being wrist warmers on me. Not these! They are plenty wide and fit over a sweatshirt or jacket. Perfect for me"
4.0,Love these. very light weight for backpacking for water shoes.
4.0,"The fabric is thicker than expected which is nice. But the sleeves aren‚Äôt anywhere near as long as pictured. Overall it seems to be a good quality shirt, just small."
4.0,nice but a bit hard to read
4.0,Love the choker. Looks great with my different pendants.
4.0,Mad I didn't get the belt!! But I love this outfit and it fits great.
4.0,"This versatile kimono is a useful accessory - not only for beach wear - and the colour is lovely. The material is a bit fragile, but it is a fine summer wrap, or accessory to dress up colour coordinated outfits indoors in chillier weather. (It is very light  - not for warmth, but for style.)"
4.0,Small was a bit big..i'm 5'1&#34; and 130 lbs had to do adjustments but material was good (semi-stretch) and colours were just as pic shows.
4.0,Disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt bigger. Giving it as a Christmas gift
4.0,They were very nice.  Good quality they just run small and they only go up to a large.
4.0,As a plus size gal you never know how these sizes will run. I'm an 18/20 and 5'7 and ordered the XXL and they fit very well. The material is on the thinner side but very comfortable and they are super wide leg! Perfect lounge / pj pants.
4.0,"Looks good,great price, fast shipping."
4.0,I work in a bakery so I am on my feet for 8 or more hours at a time so my ankles swell. I've noticed a difference when I wear these socks. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because they are a little long on me. They hit where my knee bends and rub awkwardly so I roll them down a bit.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little sheer but over all looks nice. Fabric is ok, but you can tell it‚Äôs a cheaper dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 140lbs and busty, large fits well."
4.0,Fun ring. Great price on lightning deal
4.0,Nice dress. A little oversized but can be fixed witb a belt to accesorize.
4.0,It tells time and it's cheap.  I use it at the gym and it works great for what I need it for.  It also makes me a little nostalgic since it looks just like the Casio digital watches I used to have.
4.0,I thought it was large.  Bought as a gift for DIL who teaches school.  She had picked it out and she was very pleased.  Pretty color.
4.0,Gave to my girlfriend she liked it
4.0,"I'm size 12 and following the reviews I bought XL ( it's a little bit large) , and I think L is perfect."
4.0,My son really likes it
4.0,Cute for pools
4.0,These look really nice and sleek. Good color in the mother of pearl and shiny bright goldtone.
4.0,"Super cute, thick enough material that it's not see through. Lots of compliments on it."
4.0,I love this dress. It has a lot of stretch in in and super sexy
4.0,Smaller than expected and not as long as I usually like but they are well made and not to heavy for those looking for shoulder duster earrings/ fringe earrings that do not want them sweeping their shoulders but a nice petite fringe bead earring. They are lovely.
4.0,"I chose this bag over the myriad of other simply for the color (blue/orange) and price. Works as expected.<br /><br />It's fairly compact, so if you carry a lot of products, or aren't using travel-sized everything, it may be too small. I'd say I carry a moderate amount of toiletries, and this just fits all my travel size stuff. Took it on a two-week camping trip and worked well.<br /><br />I'd prefer if the hanging hook were larger to fit over a door knob for the instances where there isn't anything else to hook it on."
4.0,"I loved this item! And have gotten so many compliments on it! I'm a true pear shape and it fit well in the thighs and seat. The buttons on the straps are a little annoying but that's preference. Additional note for us talk girls, sometimes the ankle can ride up a little!"
4.0,"The upside to this hat is that it keeps the head warm and dry. My wife enjoyed it recently while in the mountains during an early, wet snow/rain mix. It fits her well but I must admit there is not a lot of stretch in the head band part. The reason for deducting one star was because it is hard to wear the hat without a seam in the front. It's a bit odd."
4.0,"I really like the color, style, and price of this top. Just ran a little smaller than I expected. I have one in another color that's softer and bigger. I still really like it. I would just suggest sizing up if you'd like a longer, looser fit"
4.0,Cute! But the ear pieces are too long
4.0,They fit well. I measure my calf witch was 16 1/2 so I got XL. Glad I did.
4.0,"Size up, but other than that great top looks great with jeans. Perfect for an easy night out top!"
4.0,"I am 5'3/115lbs (34b), i ordered a size small and it fits, but was more form-fitting than I had hoped. That being said, it is a cute shirt and I have received compliments on it...I am just more comfortable in loose fitting clothing. Oh and it is sheer so you will definitely need a tank top under it. I have actually been thinking if i bought it in a size large i could use it as a loose swimsuit cover-up. Hope this helps."
4.0,"Second time I am buying dress from this company and 95% I love love it.  I had this dress and the only problem I have is the the bottom design on the dress is a little bit out of center... I bought a blue one too a year ago and I had a problem with a top... nevertheless I LOVE IT ALL, wish it would be more fitted and more designs!!! Love it, worth the risk!"
4.0,To big for my wife's wrist so I sent it back.
4.0,Nice glasses.  Wish they were a bit closer to my face under my eyes.
4.0,Adjustability is as advertised. Found it easy to adjust and readjust without feeling people thought I was about to undress. Easy to adjust size (belt marked clearly so you know where to cut).<br /><br />Bit more bulky than I like but was expecting this to be the case. Wanted ease of adjustment b
4.0,"Great little wallet! I really needed to downsize from my GIANT pocketbook/wallet. It was ridiculous and I‚Äôm just tired of carrying around a bunch of junk I don‚Äôt actually need. So I bought this wallet and I really like it. Fits all my necessary cards and the little money I have üòπ. The only thing is the color is a bit off. I thought it was going to be more grey like the photo, but it‚Äôs more blue. Not a huge deal, but it‚Äôs not what I was expecting."
4.0,"Flattering pattern on the front. Comfortable and secure to swim. Does good job covering the lower cheeks, but is not like boyshort style."
4.0,"The outfit does fit a little snug, and the quality isn't very good, as the material is cheap and thin. However,  I believe you get what you pay for. It's  cute and for the price, I'd recommend buying it."
4.0,"Good, casual dress. Perfect for the salon. Looks super cute with booties to transition for fall."
4.0,It looks more like a peacock to me but to each their own. The ‚Äúopal‚Äù looks pretty cheap and the gems are very cheap looking. The pendant is the size of a quarter and the chair has an adjustable claw clasp. My 4 year old daughter plays dress up with it.
4.0,Was a super cute dress that it didn't fit so I had to send it back.
4.0,"Very cute.. i got the large, and it fit okay except for the strap that goes across the breasts. there was a looooottt of underboob showing, and to feel comfortable i had to use a bunch of boob tape to make sure the ladies wouldn't pop out while i was dancing."
4.0,"It was a beautiful dress, but the hemline was different than the picture. I assumed the overlay was at least  6+inches longer than the liner of the dress. This was not the case. The length hit just below the knee and there was only about 4 inches of overlay. The dress fit great though, it just was not what I expected based on photos. This is no fault of the shop, but rather the stock photo shown."
4.0,"This was a gift for my husband.  He's a drummer and he likes it, color and all."
4.0,I had a similar pair in gold that I lost. These were a nice replacement. Wish I could find in rose gold.
4.0,"I am a solid New Balance fan; have worn them for years and can always rely on the sizing when buying online.  The trail shoes are my favorite, as they are so light.  Only complaint is that the laces now included with theses shoes tend to loosen/untie unless you double knot them."
4.0,"Love this shoe! In black it was snug for a few days. After a couple of wears,  fits great."
4.0,Like this dress but it was a tight.
4.0,Priced right. I like the leather. I wished that it would lay  better on my arm. Able to size it the way i want.
4.0,"a little bit too thin as I expected, but nicely made and excelente delivery."
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt sure about her pick for homecoming but it was adorable. She wore cape at dance and paired with sweater for dinner out. It is very thin material. Ordered large and xlarge, returned xl."
4.0,Only had it a week and worn most 9f that time. Keeps time very well and has a surprisingly long power reserve. It is a cheap watch but it looks quality and feels like quality on your wrist. Only time will tell how it holds up but right now I am very pleased. I may due an update in a couple months.
4.0,I constantly lost my keys because I had to keep them on different rings because they would set off my car alarm.....I got this and all my keys are on the same thing and none of them set my car alarm off!
4.0,I bought this top for post op after my breast augmentation because it zips  up and makes it easier to get dressed. Super cute and comfortable. I thought it would be see through being that the material is so thin but it‚Äôs not.
4.0,"Could be made better however, it does the job"
4.0,Beautiful 'n comfortable.
4.0,The shirts fit great everywhere except they fall just short on my arms.  I may consider returning and buying a medium to see if they fit better.  Love the shirts otherwise.
4.0,Given as a gift. She liked it very much and put it on right away. Thin and simple. Vey pretty on.
4.0,I like it. Simple and cool for the summer
4.0,"These are great shoes!  I brought them for my husband and he likes them very much!  As I read the reviews, we were lucky because my husband is actually a half size. He wears 10 1/2 so I got the 11.  The 11 fit, but they could be a little big bigger.  The 12 would be too big.  Having this shoe come in 1/2 sizes would be nice.  This is why I am giving it a 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall these are a nice pair of shoes.  Just make sure to size up and I think you will be happy.  We got the brown color which is very attractive.<br /><br />Pros<br />Attractive look<br />Well manufactured, look durable<br />Nice style<br />Comfortable<br /><br />Cons<br />Runs small<br />Does not come in 1/2 sizes<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review."
4.0,"Great, but stupid expensive"
4.0,"Comfy and stretchy material. Happy with this product .only thing I‚Äôm not crazy about is the waistband, it should be more compact to hold tummy in"
4.0,"The slippers are very comfortable, keep my feet warm, and I love the color.  My only complaint is the ribbon is glued on and fell off the right slipper within a couple of weeks.  The other is holding tight and I can't really remove it for fear of cutting a hole in the slipper.  Not a big deal as it in no way affects the comfort or warmth of the slippers."
4.0,This was  for a friend of mine at work she seemed  to like it
4.0,"The waist measurement on the large is listed as 30.5 - 32"" and it fits more like a 33. I have to belt these, as many others have discovered. They still fit well everywhere else and my only warning is that they probably run too short for super long legs. My inseam is 31.5"" to the ankle and these just reach that, but if I wear a heeled boot, they will be a tiny bit too short. In flats, they are great. All the pockets work and there are a million. When I load them up, I'm glad I'm wearing a belt because the trousers get heavy!  The fabric is a good weight of twill but also has the slight stiffness you find with that.  I can't say these are sexy but they aren't unflattering and geez, all these pockets! Very happy with my olive pair. My sister bought them in black and is also happy with them."
4.0,"Useful for miscellaneous items I keep in the car center console like charge cords, coins, etc."
4.0,"it is a simple watch with a stop watch feature, it can tell standard or military time, and shows the date but not the year. for 10 bucks you can't beat it"
4.0,"I got this as an Abby gabby costume to go w the toy story theme we had. This was much better quality than the cheap costume. Plus this was half the cost.  I did purchase the underskirt seperate and glad I did as it wouldn't have had the same vibe I wanted without<br />I'm approx 5'7"" 36f weight is approx 140-145. Typically a size medium top.  I was hoping for few inches shorter and little more form fitting. I wish I had grabbed a small but technically it probably fit true to size tbh"
4.0,"Lightweight. Made for cool weather, not cold. Soft material."
4.0,"I like the look of these, and thought they might be new favorites, but they‚Äôre so heavy they pull themselves out without a backer on the fishhooks. I still like them a lot, but they are large and heavy."
4.0,I love the iced out cherubs.  This piece looks real and it hasn't changed colors yet
4.0,"It's nice,  expected a thicker, sturdier material.  Doesn't feel like a compression top. Next time I'll buy a size smaller."
4.0,"Bought it for a friend who is a fan, they love it!"
4.0,"These really do help maintain the cleanliness of the hard flooring throughout my house. My very mobile 10 month old keeps me constantly vacuuming & mopping. I like to wear these while I mop so I don't leave any footprints or marks on the floor as I walk on the damp areas. They also swipe a little pet hair and debris just walking about the house, and I can rip off the bottoms & throw them in the washer. I do wish they weren't so big. My feet are about a 7 in women's and they slip right through the toe of the slippers. I definitely need to wear socks to keep enough friction to hold them on."
4.0,"First, the size fit perfectly.  I do have to reach down and hold them open to slid my foot in because the elastic is tight, but it does give enough so the foot slides in easily if held.  That also keeps the boot tight to your ankles keeping your feet warm outside.  I wear them all day.  Indoors they are like slippers.  Outdoors they are warm, and because of the ankle height and elastic keeping them tight on your ankles, keep your feet warm and dry.  The only issue is that the sole is soft.  You‚Äôll feel all the stones on the ground.  One reviewer said they didn‚Äôt breathe, but I didn‚Äôt have any issues.  Usually non-breathing shoes make your feet sweat, but I can wear them all day long and not have issues when I take them off.  So, because of the soft sole I really can‚Äôt consider then a true ‚Äòboot‚Äô, but they do make a great indoor-outdoor shoe for winter."
4.0,They are very long...and one was damaged but replaced quickly by the seller.  Comfortable and nice bright colors.  I  bought Large instead of my usual medium and they fit great.
4.0,"Nice material. If you're about 5'8"" or have a little extra in the rear or even the top, don't go with the medium size. It's too short and you'll end up having to wear leggings or something to cover your rear. Aside from being too short, the sleeves and fit around the waist were great."
4.0,"It's wonderful, but way too big in the chest area but then tight around the waist. Kinda weird, but nothing a safety pin can't fix up. Wore it to my college graduation and got tons of compliments. I'm happy with this dress."
4.0,Very pretty but the bottom piece is thicker/fatter then expected.
4.0,Love itüíü
4.0,Love it so far. Has a nice bend to the bill.
4.0,nice starter purse.
4.0,Perfect Fit. Boo!
4.0,I like the colorful case but the holes on the case do not align very well with the iPhone.  It is difficult to get the power plug into my phone because the cutout on the case is not accurate.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and was looking for something to match my husbands Christmas PJs. I love that they have pockets and a draw string. They are plenty long enough and after many washes they are holding up great. While they are thin, they are pretty warm!"
4.0,"Cute, fits good"
4.0,Costume was great! It was a hit! Unfortunately the beard was not good quality at all! I purchased a wig and beard combo in party city! Santa looked amazing! But be conscious that the beard doesn‚Äôt look good!
4.0,La chaqueta esta perfecta pero todavia no llega a su destino es para un Primo en Peru apenas llegue les comento gracias
4.0,"It's not the seller's ault tht this was too small, my son ordered the wrong size but loved the shirt."
4.0,Very warm and very light but very weather proof. The interior fleece is very warm and very dry has a vast amount of pockets.
4.0,"The fit of this dress is really nice, and the hem has such a nice effect. But the fabric is so cheap looking and the stitching looked a little rough. I ended up returning and getting another dress, but would actually love to see this cut in a better material (and would be willing to pay more)."
4.0,Beautiful colors and design.
4.0,Very basic bow tie and works for the purpose we needed it for. Fabric is good quality. Ties easily after watching a YouTube video. Has a nice look to it.
4.0,Love them<br />I just hate the two months that I have to wait to get them
4.0,She is very happy with her new slippers. Thank you!
4.0,"I love them , there a great fit !!"
4.0,"Comfortable work shoes. Best for light to moderate snow, less than 6&#34; or so."
4.0,"It's absolutely beautiful, but I find it difficult to keep on my shoulder without it slipping off."
4.0,"Due to increased rainfall, the mosquito problem has gone from very bad to barely tolerable. As such, wanted something that would protect me from insect bites while mowing the lawn. Was using insect repellent, but had concerns about applying smelly chemicals to my skin. Also, wanted the advantages of uv protection.<br />This hat more than adequately addresses both concerns. One of the nice features is the 'netting' is contained on top of the hat, hidden inside a zippered compartment. So, if going for a walk, and not wanting a conspicuous mesh net across your face, you can discreetly conceal it, with no noticeable affect to the hat or wearing comfort.<br />The design and construction of very good quality. I like that the sides of the hat are thin, lightweight material, and seem breathable. This allows ventilation, and minimizes buildup of heat (think of the heat generated wearing a baseball cap in summer). This is particularly important because the head generates lots of heat, and you want to exercise caution of body temperatures during summer days.<br />The brim of the hat is not hard, stiff, and doesn't seem to contain cardboard or plastic. So, tossing this into the washing machine won't deform or damage the hat. Tag states that the hat is 100% polyester.<br />So, if you need a hat that will keep you relatively cool, protect your face and neck from insect bites, and provide uv protection...this hat is an excellent choice.<br />Gets a high recommendation based on personal use."
4.0,"It is still early winter, so I don't have a durability report. When I received them, I imagined they would be too soft to hold up to much abuse. I am not treating them gently though. Mainly using them to do light work outside in the cold and daily get wood from the woodpile.<br /><br />Because they are comfy and not bad looking I tend to wear them around, even as gloves out and about.<br /><br />I am ordering a second pair, in case I lose of mess these ones up.<br /><br />A note on size. I got the extra large. During my life, I have mostly bought large gloves. Lately gloves are Asian made and for most things (kitchen and painting gloves) I am switching to Extra-Large. If I were in a brand-name outfitters, looking for Ski or Top Dollar hiking gloves, I would probably still get large. The extra-large was right for me in these gloves....<br /><br />I put down 4 stars. If they make it through the season looking and feeling as good as they do now, I will probably give them 5 stars."
4.0,A little weighty. But good leather. Good fit
4.0,My son loves them.  However a button fell off on the school bus.  By a stroke of luck he actually found it on the school bus 2 weeks later.  I think Velcro type fastener or a magnet would have been better option.  But they still do the trick
4.0,The dress is beautiful when I put it on I‚Äôm not to pleased with the material but it‚Äôs still a beautiful dress.. I normally wear a medium and ordered a large.. Fit me just fine
4.0,"Very cool looking bracelet!  Although the first time I wore it, one of the links came off but it was an easy fix.  I still love it and would definitely recommend it!"
4.0,"Comfortable casual sneaker, not really for jogging. Fit is loose when tied and doesn‚Äôt make sneaker feel secure. Purchased for daughter to wear to school."
4.0,Perfect for kids costume...small and light weight
4.0,Daughter loved them. Great material used to make onesie meaning quite comfortable. Fits true to size. Daughter doesn't mind bed time as much-added to my daily laundry but if she's happy I'm ecstatic so good purchase affordable I would recommend...
4.0,"Thi is the only way that I can get bracelets on, It takes a little finagling to get the bracelet hooked, but eventually I can get it hooked."
4.0,"Long, thick and warm this sweater is perfect for cold and chilly days. The length is perfect. It has an open front. The black is rich and goes with anything. Thick and chunky it is reasonably soft.Unlike many sweaters of this type it has some slight shaping that flatters. Definitely a cold weather staple."
4.0,Cute shirt.  Runs a bit small.
4.0,Nice solid bracelet.
4.0,Order one size less than your regular size
4.0,This runs extremely small had to return it. Otherwise I love the shirt. Fast delivery
4.0,"I received these Sailor Moon socks 9 days after my order (with free shipping) and I am moderately happy with this product, these socks are very nice and soft material but they have a slightly cramped feeling. I am a US women's size 9 shoe, they feel a tad restricting around my toes, like my toes all want to meet in the middle, but they are still really soft and enjoyable to wear."
4.0,"Fits my tiny wife nicely. She likes the material. Says it feels good in the Florida summer heat. Appears a good match with her flaming red hair. Material seems decent. Stitching is good, no loose threads. Washed before wearing, didn't appear to shrink.<br />I received this product at a discount for our honest review.<br />Recommended? It's a good list price for a nice short sleeve top."
4.0,"Such comfortable boxers, love them. They run a lil too big"
4.0,Love the suit but the top was too small and the bottoms fit fine..
4.0,Nice look and great bargain!
4.0,I like the shape and the fabric of the dress but it does not reach my knees and a little too wide on the hips.
4.0,It‚Äôs very comfortable.  Wish it had a bit more coverage.
4.0,"The metal rings are very close to where the watch will fit.  The ring below the watch is just millimeters away from where the watch sits.  The strap is plenty long enough, but the rings are sewn into the strap.  Just make sure this is what you are looking for.  I would have been a little happier if the rings around the band were further away from the watch, but that's on me.  Know what you are buying before you buy."
4.0,"The coat arrived fine and fit fine, except around the arms and shoulders.  Because of this it made it difficult to move my arms in front of me.  Otherwise the coat was good for what I needed.  It isn't too thick, so depending on your winter, may need something heavier."
4.0,"So I've actually bought two of these dresses.  The first dress I bought in a size medium, and I liked it a lot.  The dress was long enough to pass the &#34;bend-over&#34; test (I'm 5' 10&#34; so this is an issue) and the material was opaque, beautiful, and flowy.  It was however slightly baggy, so when I ordered again I decided to go with a small.  While the &#34;bagginess&#34; issue is better, the dress is dangerously short and I won't be able to wear it without leggings.  I don't even dress particularly conservatively, but the dress is objectively quite short.  There was a difference in length of several inches between the two dresses.  Therefore, if you're a taller girl (like 5' 8&#34;+) I'd get a medium or above to ensure you're not flashing anybody."
4.0,"It is so pretty and my 13 yr old LOVES it.  The shipment was timely, what a plus!"
4.0,Like how it stretches
4.0,"My favorite suit I've bought in years, but the chest is super saggy and I'm a DD in bathing suits. I'm going to try to tighten the top to keep the girls in but it is still a great suit."
4.0,It's a cute bracelet.  I especially love the detail of the dragon &quot;whiskers.&quot;  I should also note that the dragon has four limbs and you can see its nostrils.  The bracelet also has to be manually pulled open and closed to enclose your wrist.  Overall I think it's a very nice design.
4.0,"Overall these PJ's are very comfy.  I found them very comfy in bed all night without being to warm and very comfy on chilly mornings.  (lows of 30's to 40's, highs in 60's the week I wore them).  The top and bottom have tags that say they are the same material, but they do not feel the same and the color of the top is slightly different from the bottom.  (When I looked at pics online again, they do show that just slightly.) Also, the legs are long on me - I am 5ft tall, 150 lbs, size XL.  The banded bottom means they do not trip me, but I would have preferred them to taper enough instead of being banded because I think that is a sleeker, cuter look and it is fun to feel cute in cute cat PJ's.  I washed on the color setting on my machine and dried on the high setting,  no shrinkage.  The top is a bit smaller than I expected for an XL, but the bottoms are as I expect for an XL.  I carry most of my weight in my upper body so if I buy PJ separates, I often get a M or L bottom and an XL top. But, these work just fine."
4.0,Perfect for moderate intensity exercise as advertised.
4.0,"This is a pretty bracelet, rather basic, but decent quality.  I'm not a fan of anything that's plated because I usually wear my jewelry constantly, never taking it off until I get tired of it.  This will cause them to wear and I'm already seeing the plating slowly wearing off of this bracelet.  It is solid sterling underneath at least.  Maybe I've been wearing rose gold too long, but this plain gold seemed too yellowy.  Not my personal taste.  It did come nicely presented."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt like the lining<br />It should be cotton<br />The mask fitted well
4.0,This is not too bad as far as quality. I wished the drawstrings will stay in place. Once i pull the drawstrings it will loosen up and there is no way to tighten the drawstrings.
4.0,i bought these socks for my 9 year old son and he loves these socks because he says they are really comfortable.  they have an extra elastic middle and it seems to grip his foot quite nicely.
4.0,Material like a sweatsuit material but very nice fit perfect and arrived on time.
4.0,Very cute party dress
4.0,"Nice quatity, the only thing I did not expect to have to cut it the the appropriate lengjth.  I did not say anything about that in the description."
4.0,It's ok. Fits a bit small.
4.0,The stone is much larger than I expected to the point where it's almost tacky. But it is a beautiful piece I wish they would make it about the size of a quarter
4.0,Good option for cool weather
4.0,"The underwire makes all the difference! Out of the water, you will feel so comfortable in this swim top. Just be advised, once you get in, all of that flattering, loose material is going to float."
4.0,Not too shabby
4.0,"This is a really nice necklace. One little issue I had with it is that the links are very weak, where the chain is connected to the hook. So be sure not to exert any force on it"
4.0,"I've been looking for a pair of cute joggers for months now, but I never like the way they look on me. (Usually, the butt is too saggy.) These actually do fit well in the butt, and are more flattering than a lot of the others because there's some actual design (pockets) on the back. The fabric isn't as soft as I had hoped, but still nice. They're very high-waisted though, so if you're looking for something with a comfy fit and you're not sure on size, order up!"
4.0,Too small of a bra for a 40c.
4.0,nice different collections of angels
4.0,So far this wallet has been great. All my cards and such fit perfectly in the slots. It's great for helping me keep organized and when I need to I can throw my phone in one of the slots and just carry the wallet with ease. I would definitely purchase more from them in different colors and patterns as well.
4.0,The button was very high up but you can just not button it and wear something underneath instead and it looks really cute!
4.0,"Awesome quality...buttery leather, soft bottom crib shoe...color is a pearlized blue ...very nice"
4.0,"Nice gloves with amazing grip, but do it buy if you're going to be playing on dusty field. Gloves do not hold grip with the slightest amount of dust or dirt on them even though they are brand new. Probably great for turf fields or well maintained grass fields without dirt patches. When clean, catching rate is 99 on madden."
4.0,"Not the best leggings I‚Äôve tried, but they are very comfortable and soft. Customer service is good. No major complaints, but they are a little see through if you bend over in them so be sure to wear a long shirt."
4.0,A size up would be perfect. Color is lovely
4.0,"This was delivered in a timely manner and I love the actual peacock pendant.  The tiny blue stones really sparkle and compliment the colors in the rest of the necklace. I am disappointed with the quality of the chain; however, considering the low price I paid for the necklace, I feel like I got what I paid for.  I put the pendant on another chain and wore it and received several compliments.  I would definitely order from this company again."
4.0,Shirt fits as expected. I use them for every  day use. Recommend.
4.0,"Fit was good- dress is beautifully made, much higher quality than I would have guessed. Four stars bc it was way too short. I'm 5'7, size 4, and the small fit fine, but my ankles were showing in bare feet. Based on the other reviews, I thought it would be longer, but it def was not long enough. Can't imagine where I would where it that short, so I'm returning."
4.0,"The crystal part of this is really nice. It looks like it is real carnelian; whether it really is natural I cannot say, but it looks like it is. It comes inside the pink pouch they show, which looks more like something you would give a teenage girl, but it is doable for an adult. The chain needs to be changed. It is very thin. Mine came in tangled up fairly badly. I was able to get it loose, but it looks shorter than they say. I would be choking wearing it. I am used to having to switch out chains on necklaces as I prefer them long, so I have extra chains to use, but the chain really brought down the look of it to me. The crystal itself is worth it though and looks better than others like this I have gotten."
4.0,Liked the colour and fabric
4.0,5'11&#34; 150lbs. It fits fantastic and looks great but the material that hangs down from is more see through than the picture leads on.
4.0,Strap broke within a week but otherwise met expectations
4.0,Charming little case
4.0,"This bracelet is really pretty. The pink hues are delicate and soft looking. Big problem I had was getting it on and off.  The catch is very difficult to open and close when trying to put it on yourself. For that reason, as much as I liked the bracelet, I had to return it. Also, word to the wise -  it is made for a small wrist."
4.0,nice fit. could have gone size smaller. cute cut.
4.0,"Super cute, but I ordered the 7, for my skinny 8 year old and it was way too small.  The tag in the top actually said 6 and the tag in the bottoms said 7, but both were small, so returning for the size 9 hoping it works."
4.0,Cute except for the WHITE under lining. Shows through when you wear it.
4.0,"This running short is comfortable and fits well, however the top layer looks strange."
4.0,Sharp and the perfect size for me!
4.0,"I‚Äôm not a big fan of the material. It‚Äôs kinda like a costume. And it is very see through, which I didn‚Äôt think would happen with a red dress. I got a bigger size so it wouldn‚Äôt click to my back or hips but it still kinda does. I‚Äôll probably only use this for pictures once or twice."
4.0,"For the price the dress is well made, comfortable and flattering. I will probably wear it after Halloween too"
4.0,somewhat small but they are very comfortable
4.0,I wear this on my motorcycle (under the helmet) to keep warm on the cold morning rides to work.
4.0,Warm and we'll made
4.0,"I am a small guy. 5'3"" tall and 130 lbs. with a 39"" chest.  The small fits perfectly.  The colors are brilliant. The fabric is soft , light and looks expensive. I could not be more pleased. I am ordering more.<br />Edit 7/8/2021<br />Worn once and noticed 2 thread pulls as though something snagged shirt. Very disappointing. Unable to repair."
4.0,Runs a little big but not too bad. It is absolutely adorable. 4 stars because the bows on the leggings were glued on instead of sewed. My daughter had them ripped off within minutes. Still recommend though.
4.0,The item is as described it's cheap so the quality is what you pay for but works perfect for what I needed it for. I was confused by Asian sizing so bought a few sizes bigger because I was afraid it would be to small. The item was too big and I returned it and was refunded and purchased a new one with no problem. Excellent service.
4.0,Works as it should! I have many titanium items on my keys to reduce weight. I really like these.
4.0,Washes up well.
4.0,It is soft and beautiful but top is somewhat too large.
4.0,Love the look of these boots.  Something pokes into my ankle and I cant figure out why.
4.0,The white pair are the smallest of the three. I love how I look in them. Shipping came very quickly. The plastic is cheap so treat with care or they will break easily.
4.0,size ran a little small.  but I love the fabric and its Daryl.  How can you not love Daryl?
4.0,"These are super cute! The material is the silky type and they are comfy. The fit is true to size. However, they are see thru, and not just when you move or stretch. I have light skin and the dinosaur leggings are black, just putting them on my skin can been seen thru the material without any movement to cause the material the stretch. Returned!"
4.0,"great product unfortunately already lost one, wish they were less pricey to buy again"
4.0,Its a mask for its intended use but do not use it when its cold i think it makea it worse thsn anything i hate how it gets all humid and wet when i talk or breath
4.0,This was delivered earlier than expected. I have not taken it out of the box as it is a gift but it looks nice.
4.0,Fits will
4.0,"This is not the same as the one pictured. It is made more cheaply, the area between the eyes is just threads, the curly tentacles are much shorter and it appears to be child sized. That being said, it‚Äôs pretty cool. I would give it fewer stars, but it really is fun, and worth the money."
4.0,The shirt was great and love the color but I ordered a size too big. I'l try again later to reorder.
4.0,"This is so pretty.  I love the stones and the size, but it is a little short."
4.0,"Runs true to size. Colors are very vivid. Lightweight and comfortable. I am normally a size 14 and ordered an XL, fits perfectly. I have not washed it yet, so not sure how it holds in washer. I did wear it to work and received several compliments."
4.0,bought this coat for my mom. My mom love it and it also very warm
4.0,These leggings are so soft and comfortable and my first attempt at high waisted leggings .  Only reason I don‚Äôt give them a five is because while working out during body pump my ring some how snag the pants so they snag easily. Also they are longer than I thought they would be so they gather a little bit towards the bottom. I am 5‚Äô7
4.0,Used it for the first time today and it was wonderful!!
4.0,"I really like these. They are loose, made well and comfy but do not look dumpy. If you are into outdoor stores like REI this is a good look."
4.0,"I bought this strap for a heavy guitar, to alleviate the pressure on my shoulder.  Turns out a wide strap take a heavy guitar and makes it feel heavier.  Love the strap, and it looks great, but I actually now wish I had not bought one so wide."
4.0,"Comfy!  Wish heel would stay up when sitting, but very cushy and warm.  If you want support look elsewhere.  These are basic - warm, soft, non slip, no weight at all.  Very much what I was looking for."
4.0,Nice glasses. Good UV protection.
4.0,The way the the straps are creates a deformation. The belt loops are part way down the back of it so the top is falling over. I just need to sew the straps to the top of the bag but seeing leather is a challenge.
4.0,Like the style and the color. Good fit.
4.0,Love them. Just took longer than expected to get them.
4.0,Great shoe liners.  They fit my size 8 foot very comfortably and are not visible in my flats or slingbacks.  Wash in a lingerie bag or they will get los.
4.0,Very useable! Would buy again!
4.0,These lights are fun to put on your fingers and dance with.  Some of them kind of stop working after only a short time.  And some of the rubber band thingies don't work very well.
4.0,"its like the perfect size almost but the edges touch my feet too close, order a size up. the texture looks like it might hurt your feet but its very soft and comfy. water runs right thru them!"
4.0,"My son enjoyed as a gift. However, they broke very easily."
4.0,I really like these my only wish would be that they had a real draw string.<br />My waist is a lot smaller than my hips.<br />I will  need to take them in about 2 inches.<br />They don't stretch. Length is fine too.
4.0,Being a tall woman with size 14 feet it's hard to find shoes that will fit and feel comfortable.  These shoes are so comfy!! It feels like I'm walking on clouds...thank you!! I love them!!
4.0,"These are very nice real pearls for the price. They are not large and feel very nice when worn. Please understand if you are expecting perfectly round, perfectly matched pearls these are not for you. As anyone will tell you pearls are seldom perfect, that is the beauty of pearls the slight imperfections give them their depth of light. If you want perfect go pay 3 times as much for imperfections. As the description states this was for the necklace, bracelet & earrings.<br />The necklace is about 18&#34; and is nicely knotted between pearls. Once it warms on the neck it drapes beautifully. The earrings are a nice weight and are more flat then round. At first I was not happy with this but after putting them on I really like them.  The bracelet is 7&#34; long also knotted nicely. I have small wrists so it fits nicely and does not slip off.<br />The only reason for 4 stars is the clasps on the necklace and bracelet leaves a lot to be desired. They look tarnished and are very small which makes it difficult to put on and take off.<br />Other than that they are worth the money.<br />My advise buy them and wear them! Pearls make you feel special and walk with your head a little higher! I love them with jeans and a white button down shirt.<br />Enjoy!"
4.0,Would have been perfect if i was a few lbs lighter but i really liked this dress.
4.0,Love them although I had to bend a bit so they don't pinch my ear lobs when closed
4.0,It's very cute but very tight. Hopefully it stretches.
4.0,"The fit of the shoe is good to an extent. I bought them for my fittness competition. All the reviews I read about these ellie shoes, even all the different styles are about the same. I am normally a shoe size 6.5 so I got a 7. I am so glad I did. I think if i got a size 6 my foot woukdbt fit through the tow part of the shoe. Like the other reviews the toe part is small. I have to wear them every night in order to stretch that out. The top back strap of the heel was a little big. I had to poke an extra hole in the strap in order the top part to fit better. These are the tallest shoes I have ever worn. If your feet are not used to them they are going to be very uncomfortable at first. That's why I have been putting them on every night to stretch them a little so my foot doesn't feel so cramped. Overall they make my legs looks so long I don't think you will find anything better. Epically these types of shoes for a fitness conpetition."
4.0,"I ordered these pants in gray (medium), black (large), and black with pinstripes (extra large) as I was trying to see what fit would work best for work. Turns out they all basically fit the same! Either way they‚Äôre very comfortable and I‚Äôve gotten a few compliments on them."
4.0,Definitely not for ‚Äúthick‚Äù thighs.
4.0,Loved the hoodie but it runs small.  I normally a medium and ordered a large since I would be wearing stuff underneath.  I definitely needex an XL or 2X.
4.0,Looks very nice and dressy for the price. Zipper is a little flimsy so not sure how long it will last.
4.0,I purchased this because I was looking for a better quality shemagh. Very happy so far. The weave is tighter and the scarf is slightly larger making it easier to tie and more comfortable. The scarf also has larger tassels at the corners which set it apart from other less expensive scarfs.
4.0,"Fir great and they are not see through! The only thing is they are a little too long, so there's some extra fabric bunched up at the ankles but it's not that big of an issue haha"
4.0,"Really like the backpack, has a lot of nice features and is the perfect size for a day hike. Filled the front larger pocket with first aid items, cell phone in the top pocket and the large main pocket will be great for snacks and other essentials.  As other reviews have pointed out the bladder will leak if you don't get the cap set just right. This is easy to test for though so not a show stopper, what really turned me off was the slow water flow rate. It took a lot of effort to get any water out. I think I'll replace the bladder.  Was thinking this is a 3 start due to the bladder, but really like the pack so gave it a 4. There weren't a lot of tactical hydration packs of this size so going with a 4 because of how much I like the pack.  Let me know if this review was helpful!"
4.0,is leather but with the daily use it looses the hardness
4.0,"Too small in the chest region, a little tight around in general, but nice stretch. More a large than xl. It does feel nice on the arms and buttons well, but if you have a larger chest, don't get this size."
4.0,"It's always difficult purchasing shoes because it seems no two brands follow the same sizing chart. All things considered, I'd probably go a half size up from what I ordered, but they're pretty good for my use at the gym: non-slip, fairly durable. We'll see how they hold up."
4.0,Fit and feel are wonderful. The smart screen pads are slightly askew though so that's a bit annoying. But otherwise a nice set of gloves
4.0,The jewelry on the stud is a little large but there are no other problems.
4.0,The item is exactly as shown.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, a little to long but for what I paid I don't mine getting it hemmed"
4.0,I didn't look cool like the commercial suggested I would.
4.0,"Pretty nice, especially for the price, you can't beat it. It looks just as good if not better than some watches I have that were more expensive."
4.0,"Good glasses.  I‚Äôve bought them 3 times because I like the fit and the way they look better than my RX ones. They do break after a while but, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs due to the amount of times I tend to push them up in my head.  I will continue to buy them I‚Äôm pretty sure."
4.0,"Very cute but stone was rough and jagged. Used a nail file to smooth, didn't want it to damage skin or clothing."
4.0,I purchased a medium. Very pretty
4.0,"For this price, this watch is worth every dollar."
4.0,Haven't washed them yet. Waiting to see if they shrink. They're really comfortable.
4.0,"Soft fabric, nice print and color for a baby boy."
4.0,I like these belts a lot just a lil big had to put one extra hole in the belt. Just fyi I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 120lbs.
4.0,Great fit for 4-8 year old. Good grippers. Can‚Äôt give it 5 stars as they sent me gloves that were not he ones pictured. Returned and still didn‚Äôt get the ones pictured but close enough this time.
4.0,"Super cute, fit perfect!  My daughter loves them. The plastic is very stinky, we have to keep them in the garage or our whole house smells like it.  Otherwise great shoes!"
4.0,Nice for the $. Sturdy! Fun!
4.0,"Nice leggings for the price. I ordered the black leopard ones. You can barely see the pattern, even looking down at them myself. But they are nice material and fit pretty well. Slightly short on me. I am 5'10. And quite loose behind the knee."
4.0,Full disclosure I used a coupon so I only paid $2 for the set. Purchased a XXL & I would say the bottoms are equiv. to a US 14/16 or 18/20 depending on body type. The bralette has a small cup & no support so if you are an A or B cup good if not forget about it. Still gets a 4 star b/c the bottoms are nice & I got it in black so you could easily give bra to a friend who can pair it w/ any black pantie. The price made it worth it for me but sizing is completely mismatched for the set. Quality is decent but I am not expecting it to hold up for long but you likely won't be wearing any lingerie like this for long anyway.
4.0,Really cute. A little more flimsy than I expected. My daughter loves it!
4.0,"These leggings are light and comfy. Not the best quality, but great deal for a pack of 3. I would buy again."
4.0,Cute worth the price.
4.0,"Just as described, very durable material."
4.0,Was liked by the person I purchased it for.
4.0,To tall and big. I do have a large head.
4.0,"A little tight around my mid-section and I ordered a size that would be a little loose normally. If you're wanting a shirt that is fitted to your body then this is for you. It's fitted to midsection and my butt. Other than that, it's really comfortable and looks great with leggings."
4.0,Great for digging and planting in garden dirt.
4.0,Just received and have not had the chance to use as yet. Like the dual sided zippered compartments. 3 sizes were bigger than the competitors we saw in a travel store and were certainly at a better price point. IF they hold up well and do the job as expected they might get the 5th star.
4.0,"Not as roomy as I need with a boatload of membership cards, etc.... I have no idea how a phone would fit too..."
4.0,Nothing special. Good for running back and forth to the gym. Not big enough for a set of gym clothes and street clothes at the same time. About the same size and weight and stitching that the bag I replaced had which busted out the zippers. Good enough so far. We'll see for how long.
4.0,"It's stretchy and I love how they fit!  However.......... when they arrived, it was super smelly! Smelly, meaning like a toxic chemical smell, straight out of a China factory.  I washed it and could still smell the chemicals. So I let it air dry out on my deck for a day. It took some of it away, but not much. Took a few washes for it to go away."
4.0,It runs a little small but it's cute
4.0,"Thought this would fit my 5 year grandson, maybe usefull in a year or so."
4.0,Skittle difficult to arrange on
4.0,"I like this bindrune talisman, but the description is very misleading. The runes represented are incorrect. The actual runes displayed are: Ansuz; which represents stability and shows order, indicating intellect and the divine breath of life. Eihwaz; a magical protector and facilitator that shows in the event of the end of something we find a new beginning. Dagaz; the stability between opposites, stopping harmful energies but allowing good energy to slip through. Though the bindrune's meaning is essentially the same, please correct the description to reflect the accuracy of these runes."
4.0,This a really precious dress. It reminds me of a 1950s homemakers dress (which I love). The material is soft but it is kind of sheer. You‚Äôd need to wear a dress slip underneath. It also runs small. I got the XL but it‚Äôs more like a smaller large. The pattern and color is adequate the picture online though.
4.0,It's super cute and fits well!
4.0,"This it so nice.I am 5'9 so it didn't fit all the way to the ground like i had hoped it would, but the material is good didn't wrinkle too much after wearing it and it was warm enough to wear outside in the cold Buffalo winter. I am thinking about ordering this in different colors."
4.0,These are perfect for me and my girlfriend since we both like Pokemon a lot.
4.0,Great value. About a third larger than i thought they would. Nice long chain so it can be adjustef
4.0,"Fits great, text is legible, great price, what's not to like?"
4.0,i wear an xl got xxl fit exactly like an xl<br />arrived on time as always and well made
4.0,"Nice tie, but a little bit short (although I'm tall)"
4.0,Order size down.  Small like a medium
4.0,Nice quality and great price!!!
4.0,"I like the dress very well, except for the sort of (I think) empire waist.  Maybe it is suppose to be at the waist, but if one is well endowed up top, it ends up being more Empire.  It's okay, but would be better without it.  I'm 5'4&#34; and 140 lbs., and the medium fits well..  It's about an inch below my knees.  I got it for a cruise to Hawaii.  Will pack light and has an aloha look."
4.0,Awesome! So Damn cute and nice quality!
4.0,"I had to order several times because they ran small, but once the size was correct I loved them. They look great with jeans."
4.0,"This is a cute pencil skirt that is very soft and comfy to wear. While tall and slim seems to suit this skirt best, it is surprisingly flattering on smaller and less than perfect figures. It pairs nicely with tights and a tunic top if you fall into the latter category."
4.0,"The expected shipping date was set for January 15th or sometime after, and honestly I was okay with that. I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get it, so when I placed the order and two days later it came in the mail I was extremely surprised and happy! So, thank you for the quick shipping.<br /><br />As for the actual quality of the skirt, I mean it's not the best, but what do you expect for $10. It will be cute with some tights and boots, either way I will be wearing it. The fit of the skirt is a little tight, I normally wear a small, but bought the medium and glad I did, it fits nearly perfect. I'm about 5'4 and 130 lbs. Overall, I'm happy and no complaints on my end!"
4.0,Just as described. Great not only for holding my passport but a few important cards.  Lightweight and easy to manage.
4.0,The straps are not secure but overall its a very nice swim suit
4.0,small for me. but good quailty
4.0,"I am pretty happy with these shoes. I wear them in the house rather than at the pool. I have several pair of watershoes, and these work well as slipper. I removed the cushioned insert. It is mostly useless except that without it you can feel the stitching/sole adhesion line at the bottom of the shoe. The shoe is a little smaller than I had hoped, but is stretchy like a sock. I like the snugness, but I am concerned about how this degree of stress on the material will impact its lifespan."
4.0,"Shirts are nice, but they are a bit longer than I thought they would be. I thought they would have shrank in the wash some, but they did not. I still wear them, but I can only do it while wearing pants. I am 6 feet tall and they feel almost like a dress on me."
4.0,Comfortable dress. Not as flattering as you may think!
4.0,It wasn't as long as expected .Should be way beyond the shoulders and the neck opening isn't for everyone.
4.0,Great shoes! Bought them for my godson's birthday. I was pleasantly surprised that you can change the light-up color. I assumed it only showed up as the color in the picture. My only complaint is that they were fully charged and only lasted about 3 hours when I expected at least 5 hours.
4.0,"Fits perfect, but way too long. I'm 5'."
4.0,"nice and light weight. the color of the flowers was prettier and deeper than expected, not garish at all. The black was more of a deep brown but overall a nice light scarf, especially for just a couple dollars. I received this in 2 weeks from ordering - much sooner than projected date and certainly acceptable for free shipping!!!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, and cute grids. I usually wear 7.5, but this shoe was available in only size 8...took risk, but i'm happy as they run bit small. I think 1/2 size up will work great for little wide feet."
4.0,A little different of the colour as advertisement. Feels comfortable.
4.0,Very nice and unique hat. Fits perfectly on my almost 1 year old (he measures 47cm) and there's a bit more room left to grow. The material isn't as stretchy as previous review mentioned. Definitely get lots of compliments!<br /><br />The only reasons I gave it 4 stars is the smell- it's awfully strong and leaves his hair smelly but were still airing it out. The goggles also fall very easily. It would be nice if they added something to keep them in place since they're unwearable- at least for a 1 year old.
4.0,Like shirt I should have ordered xxl it fits but not as loose as I like. Would buy again.
4.0,"I definitely recommend these glasses, super cute and well made. I just love them!"
4.0,Love the look of these  slippers. Unfortunately they were a little hard to walk in for my seven-year-old‚Ä¶ The little green part of the pineapple kept rubbing into his food. Unfortunately had to return üòï
4.0,not bad.. got  it for the Star Trek 50th Anniversary cruise. Got an X-large and it fit fine (5-11 212 pounds.. at least I was before the cruise)
4.0,They worked very well for the glove hand trick or treat bags I put together rode my boys classrooms.
4.0,"To big for small women' hand. Even ""small"" one."
4.0,Shipped relatively fast and seems good quality. Fit was as expected and overall am happy with it for the price.
4.0,Very cute but run big
4.0,"This was a little more snug than I was expecting after reading other reviews. I still liked it though. If you have small boobs then the top will be ok for you. I have huge boobs, and had to wear a black tank top underneath the halter top to keep my boobs from falling out. I really liked the fabric and the length of the dress. It was really stretchy and shinny. I would buy this again."
4.0,I love the vionic brand. The footbed gives you comfort & support and these stylish sandals are no different.
4.0,This is light weight and versitle.  I can wear just the leaves  or just the chain with a little switching of the hoops.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 155lbs, 34DD and I got a medium for reference.<br /><br />It‚Äôs always hit or miss if the top will fit in a romper. I got the girls in and it didn‚Äôt make me look like a box. It cinches at the waist so you remember it‚Äôs there. Length is good for a short girl.<br /><br />Complaints are that the straps are garbage and entirely too short. And also the color I got was coffee but it looks more like a rust or burnt orange. Think Thai iced tea. Not the color I expected but I don‚Äôt mind it.<br /><br />I also wish there were pockets in the shorts. Not a complaint but would be nice.<br /><br />Haven‚Äôt worn it out yet but just trying it on now this is my initial response."
4.0,Love it üå∏
4.0,"Runs quite large! I ordered a XL as gift for someone who usually wears that size and it was enormous. Luckily, returning it for a size down was easy and quick. The fabric is a little thinner than expected but the colors and pattern look just as pictured."
4.0,"Belt has a good looking, worn and distressed look to it.  The leather has a rougher, rawhide appearance to it but that's just part of its charm. Sizing is spot on and because its not too heavy or bulky is quite comfortable to wear over the course of a day."
4.0,"Such a fun piece, not great quality though. The material is light and very breezy. Runs a little small, the elastic bands are pretty aggressive. They stretch but constrict pretty good so if you‚Äôre close in size I‚Äôd go up."
4.0,I loved the matching t-shirts for my son and husband
4.0,"Product seems great, leather lace easily installed into needle. However, it didn't work for us because the needle was too large to fit through the grommets on youth Sperrys (youth size 1 shoe for reference, so not infant or toddler sizes)."
4.0,So cute!!  My 6 year-old daughter is slender but has shapely legs.  These looked absolutely adorable on her but both socks were unbuttoned on the last 3 buttons when she came home from school.
4.0,"Love these! Soft and comfortable. I wear a size 9 shoe and ordered the xlarge, they fit snug but not too snug."
4.0,"The only reason I didn‚Äôt give this 5 stars is that the lock on the top is completely in-necessary & annoying & the drawer on the bottom isn‚Äôt weighted so it can easily fall out if pulled out too far. Otherwise, perfect!"
4.0,"I like it but thought it was bigger.....but it is nice just the same,..fun piece to wear...."
4.0,A little different from the picture but fits great and is good quality
4.0,Nice full length dress for summer
4.0,Smaller then I thought it would be ! A real nice piece .
4.0,Comfortable and helps just like it says.
4.0,"I have to say that  I am surprised with this shirt. I had some order issues which were not the seller's fault, rather the post office- but the seller very quickly sent me the shirt when I addressed the situation. The blouse definitely exceeded my expectations. I am 5'7&#34; 163 pounds and I ordered and<br />XL. The shirt has some stretch to it. The color is like a true rich green and it looks exactly like the picture. I had no issues with the neck. The underarm part is a slight touch big (but really just because i'm ultra picky-most people would think it's nothing).  All in all, fit well, beautiful color, good service and I'm very pleased with it. Can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"Great product, our son loves it"
4.0,wife likes um
4.0,"I bought 4 bands and 4 frames becuase I didn't want to switch out the pins, etc everytime I wanted a change.  They all work perfectly together and I was able to expand my Blaze &#34;wardrobe&#34; for less than 50$!"
4.0,Am son is a big soccer fan esp for Ronaldo. He was so happy. I bought it for his 8th birthday
4.0,It‚Äôs a pretty color hat and very light except the clear shield part is oversized than the paste part of hat  . And also the cap gets wrinkled easy cuz I guess it doesn‚Äôt has inner mezzanine or the  fabric is not suitable for hats
4.0,I got them for my granddaughter.she tiny.hope they fit.
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt respecting the chain from the bracelets to be so small but they do they're job nonetheless, only two I can trust to wear full time are the magnet one and the thick strap one."
4.0,Love these pants but if your a 32 like me I would get a 33-34 because they where rather right on me other than that they are awesome high quality :)
4.0,"These are a great deal. Sleek and muted colors. The pocket for keys creates a lump without keys, which can throw off the look a bit. Still will probably buy more for the fit, which slims muffin tops."
4.0,"This is just OK.  I returned it.  The flowers were a lot bigger than they look in the picture.  The fit was great, though.  I loved the empire waist.  I would definitely buy it in a solid color."
4.0,Too small..i gave as gifts.
4.0,Loved the sleeves and stain very nice!<br />Disliked how short the top is!
4.0,Nice studs. Looks better in person.
4.0,Only complaint is that the pants are a little weird. Daughter likes them though so im not going to complain :)
4.0,"These pants fit really well and they look nice. My real problem with them is just the material. It reminds me of dress pants from the '90s. They have a little bit of shine, and they are loud. Like polyester. They just weren't quite the right look for me. The fit is great. I'm just not digging the fabric- which is purely personal preference."
4.0,Awesome very cute
4.0,The dress is very pretty and red just big
4.0,They was nice runs  little small. I would  recommend
4.0,Fits pretty good. Looks as picture. It was exactly as expected. Nothing wrong so far. Pretty confortable. Good quality for the price. I could buy it again
4.0,I collect Wolves of all sorts; I like this pendant
4.0,I wish the brim were wider to keep sun off face.<br />Good strap on it for windy days.
4.0,"Well made, light weight.  Stylish, fits as expected and comfortable."
4.0,Great for the price and large!
4.0,"Nice quality, thicker cotton so not see through at all.  If you don't have a bust, or you have a very short mid-section, the cross-top will bunch and is not flattering.  Better for taller or bustier women."
4.0,"The color is perfect, just wish the back slouched a little bit more."
4.0,Sides (under arms) are cut lower than expected. Shows bra/tanktop
4.0,"I love this dress,I have not had time to wear it yet,I tried it on,a little tight on my hips, I got a size larger,I weight170lb)... really good material"
4.0,"The top is perfect. I ordered L since my breasts are D cup. I am 5'4&#34; and 123 lbs. I should have ordered M, but then the top would be too tight. It is very cute, just hard to match top/bottom if you are large int he breast area."
4.0,Pretty & fun...a nice change from fine jewelry.
4.0,Love them have a couple
4.0,Beautiful on.  Being a curvy woman (small in the waist and very large hips) Had to put it over my head to wear.  Wish it had a zipper.
4.0,look great on my wife
4.0,"For the price, you get what you get. One of them didn't come perfectly though. The stitching was a little off."
4.0,I got this to wear under my wedding dress. During the full dress try-on it held up great and the cups fit perfectly for a really pretty look. The band was snug but I bought an extender to help it fit a little looser.
4.0,Just arrived today and I love it! I was expecting something more substantial but they weren‚Äôt  kidding when they listed it as dainty. It‚Äôs very light. Almost fragile feeling. Here‚Äôs to hoping it doesn‚Äôt break. I‚Äôll update if I have any issues with it but so far it‚Äôs beautiful! Very feminine and understated.
4.0,Top is to big / bottoms fit good
4.0,It was beautiful i loved it good pricing but came apart first day i got it now i cant wear it
4.0,peassa Women Summer Casual Flowy Plain Short...<br />The armholes are too large. I sew & make the armholes smaller.
4.0,"They sure do slim out the stomach area. Perfect fit around the waist. But, the butt and leg area are a little too tight. I think that's just big booty girl problems. Oops!"
4.0,I bought these socks  expecting to get a black pair but got black and white. I mean the out side of the socks were you  find the compass and square is black  but the inside where your feel go is white. So when I put the socks on and the material  streaches you can see the white showing through and that spoilt the socks in my opinion
4.0,"First of all, I have received a different dress, same navy color and material. However, I have decided to keep it.<br />The size seem true. Fits good. However, if you have a great bust, it is not the best model for you. Unless, you will cover the top with a scarf or massive jewelry."
4.0,Beautiful colors and fairly good fit for a sIze 14 child.
4.0,I got these sunglasses a day late and they also sit a little crooked on my face and I put them down on a flat surface and they‚Äôre not even on the left side but other then that they‚Äôre great!
4.0,Love it! Freaked my boyfriend out because he thought I had gotten my nose pierced.  The only thing I don't like is when I smile the ring flips up
4.0,A little bug but nice!
4.0,Toe box could be higher for diabetic other than that this is my third pair of these boots. These outlast the diabetic shoes from the Doctor.
4.0,I am a 9.5.  There is no way a men's 11.5 can get into these and still have any blood flow. .i wear socks doubled down from the top. They work on for me.
4.0,"I really like this sweater. It's soft and comfortable. I really like the design. It's a loose knit with large holes making the chevron pattern. I personally chose to layer this with a colored camisole. I think you could wear this without something underneath, but I prefer not to. The fit is good. I waver between a medium and large usually. I went with the large in this and that fit perfectly. It's not too baggy or too tight. I have a short torso so often shirts and sweaters are too long, but this hits me nicely in the hips. Overall, this is just a nice sweater."
4.0,"So stretchy! The material fit so well and the shorts don't ride up. Really great for summer! The pockets can sometimes get stuck in the distressed parts which can be annoying, and the back pockets are a little short, but not too bad"
4.0,"okay so I was really excited for the tunnel part of gauging and so I got this kit, sounds like a good deal right ? tunnels and tapers? awesome! well I ordered this kit expecting 18 tunnels / 18 tapers but instead , they accidentally gave me double tapers and no tunnels! quite upsetting , not to mention there's no option to contact this specific seller (at least not on the app version ) so yeah that's my experience . very good quality steel though! just cross your fingers that they get your order right!"
4.0,Beautiful piece of work. Much smaller than expected but very happy with the look for the price. Definitely a good buy.
4.0,"I got these so I could use them as practice for HTV applications and they take the vinyl well.  I'm not a huge fan of the handles.  I would be nice if they were the same color as the bag and sturdier looking.  The handles feel pretty cheap.I'm going to market these bags to kids, so they won't have as much stuff to carry as we do."
4.0,"Great style, but they sit on a sort of funny spot on my face. Better construction than anticipated, and heavier, but not of lasting quality."
4.0,Style was was not what I thought it would be. Very good quality. Nice jacket.
4.0,"I actually was really happy with this bathing suit. I felt like it helped to cover my midsection, which I am a little self conscious of."
4.0,"I wore This on New Year‚Äôs Eve and man, I got a plethora of compliments! Everyone said I looked great and the dress was a hit. I ordered a large and it was a little bit too big in the waist, but overall this is a great party dress. It‚Äôs scratched my under arms just a little bit but nothing that was too bad. Definitely a good party dress."
4.0,I wear aviators everyday. I manage a few pools and waterfront areas. Shades are a must. Bas d on the nature of my work a go through 3-4 pairs of glasses a summer. I was buying ‚Äúcheap‚Äù $15 pairs. These shades hold up better then the $15 each pairs.<br />These are darker then most I find. Cheap so I don‚Äôt mind when I break them by dropping them off a lifeguard stand. Occasionally a lease pops out but usually I can pop it back in.<br />My o my wish is to get rid of the flag lenses. I am prone to migraines and cannot wear these lenses without getting a migraine.
4.0,"I complain at all about the price of these!<br />They are nice, plain, natural wood colors. True to size.<br />1 out of the 6 plugs has some rough spots on the saddle, but I cant feel it when wearing them.<br /><br />They look great. For $2 per plug, you cant go wrong! Even if you only like one pair out of the three, you'd be saving money buying these"
4.0,"my son loves them, said they're not heavy and clunky and can't wait for winter to wear them.  The winter elements will be the true test though."
4.0,"Though it's a little small, but she managed to wear it but the quality is good,thick and keeps warm,good product but for sizing, I won't give 5 stars"
4.0,"So these get a high rating for overall quality as they are heavy and well constructed. However I think they are cut for Asian sizing as they just fit funny. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the way they look on me. I'll use them for home work outs but definitely not in public."
4.0,Fit good for my 93yr old Father with very bad edema.  Only wish they were thicker.
4.0,"This shirt has a nice weight to it. I am taller, 5'10"" and I sized up to a large although I am typically a S/M. The shirt did shrink in the wash but it did not ball up."
4.0,"I've ordered a lot of Milacolato jewelry because I love it. I jumped at the chance to get this adorable unicorn necklace. When it arrived I was so excited until I realized that the back of the unicorn is hollowed out. I have other animal shaped pendants that are complete (not flat on the back or hollow) & I expected this would be the same way. Sure it's super cute esp. with it's teeny tiny crystal eye, but when it twists, you see an ugly hollowed out main body (the legs are solid, but flat). I've come to have very high expectations of Milacolato, so this is a huge disappointment for me."
4.0,I liked this dress fits big but it's cuye
4.0,"My son usually wears a 1, so I ordered a 1.5 because I had read reviews about this shoe running small. I am glad I did. They fit just right. He is happy with the shoe."
4.0,Subtle cuteness!
4.0,"very fun shoe...lightweight+bouncy and flexible as well...hyperburst is softer than the way it was implemented in the ride 8, but the pod outsole has me concerned for durability...toebox also a bit narrow"
4.0,The shorts on this swimsuit for a large are a little small.  But I have short legs and my thighs r my biggest issue.  But it's cute.
4.0,Fit a little big but love it
4.0,"I love the beautiful color. It fits my very full figure. Most of my weight is in my hips and butt. I have it 4 star instead of 5 because I have not washed it. I bought others aprons did not fit properly.  5'5""  300 pounds."
4.0,As expected.  Good quality.  Runs a little small.
4.0,Love this purse was just a little disappointed when I received it and opened it the front had a bunch of dark black scratch marks on it. I was able to remove most of them with soap and water. Just dont think for a brand new purse and the price it should have shown up that way.
4.0,Sweatpants came in good condition and fit perfectly.
4.0,Fashion item
4.0,These look and feel great. The fabric is perfect.
4.0,"This is a fun dress! The poofiness of the skirt adds some sass to the dress. I bought this for work and love that it is modest but also stylish. It does come extremely wrinkled (it's in a bag), but I anticipate being able to iron it fine. I am 5'2&#34;, so it's a bit long on me but everything is. The one star loss was due to the color and sleeves. The green is a dark, forest green and the sleeves are shorter than the picture. My husband said it looked nice but needs accessories so I will try it with a belt or cardigan."
4.0,"I've only been using it for a day, but it seems sturdy. Looks elegant (compared to the sporty look). Made use of the link remover; worked as described. Also received a protective cover with my order; too bad it was damaged. Overall, I'm satisfied; if not for the watch cover being damaged, would have rated it a 5 star."
4.0,"Regular scrub cap. Covers my hair with a clip in it. As in, I can wear my long hair up in a clip and this cap covers my head. Pretty pattern too."
4.0,"These seem like very nice quality rings. They were packaged nicely & I like that you get 2 of them, but they are definitely too big for my nose. These were the first rings I ordered after having my nose pierced & I wasn't positive on which size to order so that's not the fault of the rings. The only downside I did notice is that they don't sit quite right in my nose because of the flat back - if I try to position differently, it goes right back to how it was. Overall nice product though."
4.0,"A little smaller than expected, compartments are tight."
4.0,Love the graphics love the color good fit. But the material is awful. If this were more of a cotton rather than the silky material it would be perfect. 8 out of 10 would recommend.
4.0,Comfy and does not wrinkle - it's my go-to travel dress.
4.0,Product is nice but runs to the smaller size.
4.0,"Looks great, fits well I'm 5 foot 4 inches and 147 lbs. I ordered medium and it's long enough for a dress and fits great not too tight anywhere."
4.0,very nice piece of jewelry in live with it .<br />i recommend
4.0,"I like these earrings, but wish they had a more secure feeling clip"
4.0,this was a gift she loved it
4.0,"I love it soooo much that I'm holding on to one just in case I keep losing weight. I know, I know. Stacy and Clinton said to not hold onto clothes in hopes of weight change or weather.<br />Me? It's too tight in the arms. I bought another one of this same blouse from a different seller to see if it would give me a little more room to move. With zero stretch, my big arms get stuck when I try it on. It looks exactly like the picture/model. The hem is a great length - I""m 5""5' with an average torso. The tail hits (holding it up to my body) around mid-thigh almost knee. Covers my bottom.<br /> ...  This Top Is WONDERFUL!!!  ...  So very pretty! I'm willing to wait for my weight! Maybe my arms will go down a little!  It's a statement piece! #Motivation!!! And white parties are all year now! WOOHOO!!! lol"
4.0,Affortable and comfortable
4.0,"The quality of the shirt seems solid, time will tell how it holds up, though.  The material is strong and not thin or cheap.  There are no tags or writing at all in the shirt that I can see.  It took forever to get here, but it came from China so I suppose that is expected.  It seemed a little large for a large, but I washed it and it fits better, although my son loves bigger shirts anyway. I got it for him because he just enlisted in the Army and needs some nice shirts.  I think it's a great shirt, feels like a quality shirt, but I will update over time if I feel that it falls apart with use or washing.<br /><br />I received this product free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
4.0,Love the fit. The tucks down the bodice are very flattering. I am looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!
4.0,"Good quality leather boot, not one ounce of arch supports though!"
4.0,Love this hat. Bought  from a local store  fkr 10$ cheaper. Great jat for those that work outside. The material on bottom of brim keeps the brim.up and sun off of face. Goes great with overalls to finish that farmers look.
4.0,smaller than I expected but as above she will love them
4.0,"Good quality, lots of variety in the sizes. We have only used them twice, but the zippers work great so far."
4.0,Clean and simple look. Would be nicer if it comes with box but still I like it.
4.0,My daughter loves it but it was a lot smaller than expected. We read that from other reviews and went a size up but really two sizes is needed. I also thought it would be more like a jacket but its sweatshirt like. Still she loves it and wears it all the time now.
4.0,"I like them, used them for a 5k that involved several obstacle courses. They held up with no problems, never came loose but easy to remove when you tug at the rims. The adjustable feature is great to wear your glasses where they fit most comfortable."
4.0,"This is attractive, looking very much like in the photos, but it was slightly bent, which means it isn't terribly strong. It is more appropriate for an adult recipient who will wear it carefully, because it can bend."
4.0,"I thought the case might be a little harder than it actually is, but it is firm enough to keep my sunglasses from being crushed when I toss the case in a bag or purse. The zipper closes nicely and is long enough to allow for larger pairs of sunglasses to fit easily. I like the cute design and would order this product again."
4.0,"Got this for a friend, she loves it, as for myself, I think it is a little wild or strange looking. But that's just me."
4.0,I was pleased with the construction and quality.
4.0,"I really like this vest. I'm pretty curvy and busty and most vests just don't fit comfortably around my chest, but this one is so adjustable that I have no problem adjusting it to fit comfortably. I love the cinch mechanism that lets you adjust the fit on the fly, and there's plenty of room in the back zip area for layers, etc. The chest bottles are sort of a pain to get in the pockets, especially while on the move. While, overall, I really like this vest, I have two major complaints. First is the lack of a dedicated phone pocket in the front. In order to have a phone within reach, you have to use one of the bottle chest pockets because the zipper pockets are too small to fit a phone. I only carry my phone on trails for safety reasons and I want it within reach if, God forbid, I ever need it again. The second complaint is that the material they use around the neck is only one step away from sandpaper and will chafe the crap out of you. I like to run in tanks, but I always wear a regular shirt when I use the vest and it still chafes my neck."
4.0,"Fits as to be expected! Sexy!  I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù and still it‚Äôs  so short you can see my butt ,<br />so fun but def sexy !<br />Only complaint , I was wanting it to be red as shown and it was VERY orange/red moreso .<br />Not annoyed enough to return but def don‚Äôt be expecting a RED little dress!!!"
4.0,Love the fit and helps on 40-50 degree cold days but does not block the wind.
4.0,Several compartments
4.0,"Nice material,  fits as it should,  washes well"
4.0,They are nice. My daughter wore them quite a bit in the winter.
4.0,Harder to shorten the links than It should have been. Link adjuster was different than the picture showed
4.0,"I love the dress and material, very elegant but the shoulders part alitte too loose.. I will have to have someone fix it to make it smaller. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 128 lbs."
4.0,I like this bracelet very much.  It is very pretty.
4.0,"Cute dress for the price. My daughter is normally a 2T. I ordered a 3T and it was too short (she has a longer torso), so I returned it. I reordered a 4T and it was too loose. Order up, that's for sure."
4.0,"Nice for the price. Only 4 stars because the lace is a bit stiff and there is very little stretch. I am 5'8, 170, 36DD and the XL fits even if the top is a bit small. It works for me anyway cuz a simple teddy and a bra are my 2  daily mainstays and my bra  provides structure even if my other undergarments have none.  Since functionality/support, doesn't seem to be a likely intent of the design and construction, it probably won't work well as an undergarment for the extra-busty, and upsizing won't help;  BUT...!  It's very flattering and if you want something pretty, sexy, and with just the right amount of coverage to retain a bit of mystery, it's great. Oh, your partner will probably like it, too...<br /><br />Having said all that, I used the size chart with U.S. equivalents provided by the mfg (in the description) and think it's  pretty true to size -- Don't be confused, I failed to mention that even though I'm  in the US, the bain of my existence is lack-of-room-in-the-chest in size XL when shopping. And it's particularly tricky with lingerie, when a size 14-16 is required for the accommodation of boobage (and not be too large everywhere else), at the same time fitting the size 8-10 bottom half!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, hides my tummy, looks very pretty, I am not embarrassed of my self in this."
4.0,This shirt is true to your size.
4.0,It is beatiful my honney will love it
4.0,My 3 yearold son loves this shirt and wears it all of the time! It‚Äôs a little stiff though.
4.0,Too tight for a dress and I ordered 1 size up.  Luckily I needed it as a slip under a sheer navy dress.  It works perfect for that.
4.0,"The large is a little loose which makes it blow off the head in windy situations.  The size medium was far too tight for me so I settled for the large because I prefer looseness to constriction. I love the hat  though and am very pleased with the way it holds its shape, even when soaking wet."
4.0,"Bought these two years ago and I still wear them to the gym all the time! The colors are so fun, but they can be a little hard to match to a top if you're picky about your workout outfits like I am."
4.0,"Ordered this in multiple sizes. Thinking with my recent weight gain, I ordered this in the two larger sizes. Wrong move They were massive. Ended reordering it in a medium for a better fit. Probably could even shimmy into a small If I really wanted to. For reference, currently 5'3"" and 40-34-42."
4.0,To go a church
4.0,"The quality on these was great. Only problem is, I ordered a 6-9mo set. These are the same size as the 12mo set I got somewhere else! Way too big for now. At least she will grow into them eventually."
4.0,I loved it but it was to sheer and I didn't feel comfortable walking around my bridal suite with a bunch of people wearing something that sheer.
4.0,Simple and just what I wanted.  There was an initial issue--the watch arrived not working--but they immediately responded and sent a new watch that is ticking just fine and holding time well.  Very grateful for the excellent customer service!
4.0,"Super cute, didn't really stay off my shoulder though.  Fit as expected."
4.0,"my 11 year old loved it! only problem was is not true to size and he‚Äôs petite, 4‚Äù8  might want to go a size up other then good material is great too"
4.0,I am pleased with the overall quality of these replacement lens for the price. Definitely not comparable to OEM but these did revive my 10 year old pair of batwolfs.
4.0,My daughter loved this phone case
4.0,Safe distance dancing.
4.0,Received same as mentioned in product description
4.0,"One of the pairs was a different color than displayed (purple instead of green) otherwise I would have given 5 stars... they were the right size, fit snuggly and comfortably."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised. I wear a 40DD and I'm about a size 12/14. I ordered this in an XL and while its not the most supportive bra and doesn't fit my boobs perfectly it fits and supports &#34;good enough&#34; that it looks cute under tops. I'd buy it again.
4.0,Love the material. Runs a little large
4.0,"They are cute for fashion and photos, but they are really practical. I love how oversized and extra dramatic they are, but the back of the glasses will reflect into my eye and make it impossible to wear on a sunny day. If you want them to look good then yes get them, but if you want an everyday sunglasses then maybe keep looking. To be fair there are marketed as fashion sunglasses, but I wish they didn't glare into my eyes."
4.0,"I wear a size 16 and this fits perfectly! flows very nicely, very nice quality of material. very happy with it."
4.0,A little snug...but supportive
4.0,"Boots are solid but somewhat cheaply made, a couple of the latches have snapped off of mine. Still not bad for short term costume wear."
4.0,"I like them, but from some of the other reviews I was expecting a little more padding."
4.0,"They sent duplicate colors and they do shrink a lot on the wash. When I pulled them out to try on, the went down past my hips. After washing and drying the now sit right above my hip. So short than I normally wear. But good for the price."
4.0,Perfect size and gold/ silver color combo
4.0,"I ordered this coat next day shipping because I wanted it before the weekend. I recieved it today and tried it on. The quality is great for the price and it wasn't too heavy or too light. It would make a perfect spring coat although I bought it for fall. I tried to read other reviews for sizing but nothing was helpful so I hope this will help someone else. I am 24, 5'5ish and about 135 pounds. I typically wear a small or a small medium in shirts and a 4 to 6 in jeans/pants and I ordered this coat in a medium and it was a little on the baggy side. It might be fine if I wore a thicker shirt under it but I think I would have been happier with a small. Although I'm 24 I still can't wear &#34;womens&#34; clothes and I believe this is sized more for a full proportionate woman. If you're a young lady I'd recommend a small in this coat. BTW I ordered the tan color and it was a good choice. Picture included."
4.0,"Seriously sexy, I will not be able to wear it as a dress but I paired it with some faux leather leggings and it is super cute. I could throw a cami under or show cleavage depending on where I wear it. It is not thick flannel material but more of a challis material which is nice. Definitely not a bodycon dress."
4.0,Great price! If they break no big deal. Fit is good. Dark lens is needed here all year.
4.0,"The bracelet looks just like it is advertised. It‚Äôs plastic, but still served the purpose of matching a very expensive sandal that I purchased."
4.0,comfortable shirt to expensive
4.0,The quality of the material makes this a good product. Its not made leather fillers or pleather.
4.0,I love it. It looks good and fits great.
4.0,They look classy and the price is great
4.0,It's light and it shades the head and neck.
4.0,It look like it did when I ordered and I love the way it feel it is very pretty
4.0,"This hat has kind of a striking look, with the bold black and cream design. It offers some sun protection and makes a definite statement. Fit is good."
4.0,"Purchased this for upcoming camping trip. It feels pretty layered and like it will help in the cold. I will say that I sized up as recommended and glad I did but even then, the arms are VERY tight. I‚Äôm always particular about sleeves because I do have pretty thick arms. I typically wear a medium but also dependent on fabric. I purchased the large and the arms are pretty tight, still able to move but def motivation to drop a few pounds so it can fit just right. So big armed sisters beware, may be too snug and I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs due to material."
4.0,Good quality. A gift for a preteen it holds up well
4.0,Should have taken a bigger size.
4.0,"Nice, basic, no frills hoodie.....warm and generous fit....these run a bit large"
4.0,"My son has high arches, so not the best support with these, but he loves them!"
4.0,I have this one and the black and white one.  I enjoy wearing  them both.  This one with the color tint adds to the unique look.  It is n9t just to Doctor Who fans or Steampunkers.  It works well for anyone who likes something unique or like making things.  The chain is sturdy to hold the heavy pendant.  Makes a great dailybwear necklace.  This could be the accessory that back as your signature piece.
4.0,"Pretty nice purchase for 20 bucks. Has the aviator look and style for bigger or wider faces. The 66 mm length fits my face nicely. The drop of the lense is little bit large, though. Makes me look like I lost a little weight on the plus side :-)"
4.0,"I loved the color and material of this dress. However, I am generally an XL. I ordered a 2X and it was still very tight. I ended up giving it away because it wasn‚Äôt that expensive and I wasn‚Äôt out much money. Such a pretty dress though."
4.0,Love these glasses. They are super cute and comfortable.
4.0,The only thing not to like is that it's made in China.  Just about unavoidable on Amazon it seems.
4.0,"Good quality, little big for me"
4.0,Good necklace but the black paint is fading. You get what you pay for though.
4.0,Not the same color and stitching is a little off.
4.0,"I purchased these at a discount price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />These socks are super comfortable and soft. The grips on the bottom prevent slipping, which is awesome. They are surprisingly thin, but very sturdy. Only a little larger than expected, but not by much."
4.0,Love the dress but the arm holes are bigger than expected.  I had to wear a layered tank top under...but it added a cute pop of color!
4.0,The Adrional belt loose but in general it's nice
4.0,"great glasses especially for the price. Not very comfortable, but you can add some silicone nosepads on the bridge to help!"
4.0,I like this dress/Tunic but it came a little bit too large so I took it in at the shoulders.  Now it fits perfectly.
4.0,I liked this tee very much just a bit small and a larger size would make the round neck too wide for me.
4.0,"It's comfortable, but the pocket ripped the first day."
4.0,"Great item for the price, but the pocket isn't big enough for my cell phone 12 Max Pro...not sure if I will keep it or not, plus didn't realize it wasn't RFID.  Otherwise great little purse for a quick and easy shopping day.  The storage is great!"
4.0,"Used for carrying groceries, including heavy juice bottles, and they hold up well. As a beach bag, it‚Äôs great for all the toys. A lot of stores give discounts if one brings their own bags."
4.0,Really pretty but very large
4.0,I love this keychain!  So far it has worked without issues. I clip it on my Coach purse that is black & it looks like it was made to go with my purse. Makes finding my keys super easy & the clip makes it easy to get on & off.
4.0,"Fits great, pants are a little see through, but maybe that‚Äôs because the color she choose is bright not dark."
4.0,Needed to go up another size but it wasn't available. But looked pretty good
4.0,"Very useful camisoles, although not quite as long as seen on the model."
4.0,My wife loved it. The material is awesome. She looks great in it.
4.0,I'm happy with the sweater
4.0,I like them but they are a little big!
4.0,super warm and super comfy. 5 star if they would have fit closer to expectation
4.0,Soft material flowy and cool! Perfect for summer comfort!
4.0,"So first the good things, this dress is a great dress for the price, it is modest, yet classy. The bad thng is that the sizing confused me. I am 5ft 4 inches tall and 150 pounds so I ordered a size 8-10 the dress came and it says xl on the tag, so I had a little to much room in the middle. Had they also put the xl next to the number sizing I would have ordered the smaller size which would have been a size 8 instead of 8-10."
4.0,These earrings were very pretty and I really like them. I can't wait to wear them and see how they make my outfit look fabulous. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
4.0,This fit well and I received many compliments wearing it. I was a little surprised by the fabric material as it‚Äôs a bit shiny. The item came as pictured. It washes well and doesn‚Äôt fade. One small complaint is the zipper detail doesn‚Äôt zip all the way so there is a small hole left in the shoulder area.
4.0,"I ordered this for my 3-yr old grandson. The fit is perfect, and he loves the colorful dinos. I also like the thinner material (some reviews did not) because he can wear it in warm weather."
4.0,"I bought a few different Blaze bands, and this is my favorite by far.  It's very comfortable on my wrist, holds the Blaze securely, offers good bump protection, is comfortable enough to sleep with it on, and I can wear it several days in a row without getting a rash on my wrist. The only thing I don't like about it is the look, it sort of has that big, chunky, late 80s digital watch vibe, especially the black one. But I like it enough that I'm buying another one in a different color, so that says something."
4.0,Size is actual size.  Warm and well fitted even for curved or noncurve bottems people.Gave it 4 stars not 5 stars do to onr of them had a small tare.
4.0,Way higher quality than I expected for the price. We got the purple and the suspenders and bow tie match in color. This will definitely work for my kid‚Äôs prom.
4.0,"It is cute and comfortable but a bit see-through for my taste, I‚Äôd wish it was a little thicker"
4.0,Nice glasses but I couldn't get used to the gold tone frames.  Lenses are slightly larger than I expected and I would purchase these if they were available in silver tone frames.
4.0,Can't beat the price. Shipped fairly quickly.
4.0,Runs true to size and fits perfectly. A little cheeky but I also don‚Äôt have a big butt. Only gave it 4 stars because the sides are not adjustable.
4.0,"I ordered this because we love the movie Elf in our house so this costume is fun for the holidays, and my husband is a good sport. The costume itself is true to the movie which is nice. The faux fur on the jacket is a decent quality and the coat itself is pretty decent quality. My husband has long arms and the jacket is a little short in the sleeves, but it's not bad. The hat is lightweight but stands up fairly well and it was packed so that the feather was well protected. The boot covers are very lightweight and were extremely wrinkled when they arrived but a quick very light steam helped smooth the worst out. The belt is actually a decent quality as far as costume belts go. The pants though... Oh, the pants. Yes, they are designed to be a legging style. But these... These are tissue thin. If you don't wear a dance belt or cup underneath EVERYTHING is visible, and the jacket does not cover anything in that area when worn. I would honestly recommend buying a different pair of bottoms to go with this set. The price on this is in line with many costumes on the market and I would say the quality matches overall. If you are a fan of the movie I would recommend this, with a different pair of pants."
4.0,It‚Äôs okay fitting! You have to be very stylish to pull<br />This off
4.0,I thought this was going to be comically large but it just slightly larger than a real gavel. If you are going for big and comical this isn't it.
4.0,I love the silhouette of these boots. Faux suede they are very Nice.stylish. They fit but were a little small. The block heel is high but reasonably easy to walk on. There are side zippers which make getting them on and off easy.
4.0,Nice quality but it‚Äôs quite short
4.0,"Cute casual summer dress, with a nice  looking pattern.<br />The dress is fully lined.has a elastic sewed in around the waist, and a tie that is not sewed in, cute.<br /><br />This is a large,  but I can wear it. One of My daughters is taller,  bigger busted, and larger then I‚Äôam, this fits her.<br />I probably would wear a small or medium. When clothes are made in foreign countries its hard to tell if<br />They run big, small or true to size.. This runs big I think.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 132 lbs, and a smalled boned women.<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt care for about this dress is, the long back of the dress. I think it‚Äôs too extreme. Hangs down to long,  and looks silly.<br />The slit , open side looks good..<br /><br />Cute dress for the price,<br />Wash, do Not put in the dryer, do Not iron this dress. Hang to dry."
4.0,Great for what I need them for.One problem is the beer bottle hat is small.  mug hat is a decent size. Great value though.
4.0,"I liked the mix of colors. The design is a little unusual in that there is a thick ""lip"" that is only on the back of the top of the sock, but that offers some nice cushioning and makes it easy to grab when taking the socks off. There are these little vents on top of the sock by the toes, so you can feel a little bit of air circulation. That said, I feel like these socks are a little slippery inside of my shoes once they get sweaty. They've made it safely through multiple washes and I am pretty satisfied given the cheap price and the styling."
4.0,Fits a little big around the thigh/pelvic area.
4.0,Buy smaller size with this brand.  1 down from your usual.
4.0,"Didn‚Äôt like it at first, but now I love it. It fits all my stuff and stretches out nicely. Will probably order again in another color."
4.0,I would have given this five stars if the chain itself didn't break the second day i got it.  I fixed it but had to completely remove the chain.  It's still usable.
4.0,35th anniversary is jade. I bought this for my wife and thought it looked really nice. She wasn't that impressed though. I guess she expected more for 35th. Live and learn.
4.0,I was looking for a vegan substitute for a braided leather belt and this does this trick.  It doesn't catch the eye as an obvious cloth belt like some others I've seen.  It has some stretchiness to it which allows for a good range of movement.
4.0,"BIG socks! The fit is good, off though these are long:). Comfy on"
4.0,I did read the reviews about the dress running big so I went with my size which is a Medium & I‚Äôm glad that I did. The dress is beautiful & well made.
4.0,Great watch my cousins love it
4.0,"I do a lot of photo shoots and cosplay and to be able to add this hat to my collection was exciting. I have received the Black hat with the black feather. I will be using this hat for a 50's photos shoot in which my outfit has a lot of color so I wanted a hat that would stand out in the photos.<br /><br />The materials of the hat are quality grade and it is put together with time, patience and quality in mind. One issue I do have is that it collects a bunch of lint witch is understandable for the product. The feather is smooth and wraps around the hat making it a great conversation piece. The silver medallion brings the entire hat together making it a great piece to wear for any event, wedding and or costume.<br /><br />Overall I do recommend this hat for the quality and the price.<br />Disclosure: I was sent this product at a deep discount or at no charge with no obligation."
4.0,Needs a little more weight to make it lay flat.
4.0,"Great stickers, but one of the stickers are a suggestive image of a character (Klee) who is a CHILD and one of the keychains chipped from a corner. Would advise the seller to remove that sticker and get a new image. Photo is censored for very obvious reasons. Please, remove this sticker from future sales."
4.0,"These rings were too big for my daughter's fingers so they will be returned.  She only took them out of the packaging, tried them on, and decided they were too big, so I cannot make comments regarding the quality of them."
4.0,A little pricey but a good purchase otherwise. You have to read the instructions carefully before using it. Bought it about a year ago and it is still working perfectly. Quite noiseless really.
4.0,"The fit was true to size. The dress is comfortable. My only complaint is that the tassels are really bright, almost neon, compared to the print on the dress itself. I solved this problem by painting each tassel in diluted black paint to tone down the color."
4.0,"Very nice, good buy for the money"
4.0,"Good product,well-priced,very comfy."
4.0,"Really cute fit well, material is super thin"
4.0,"Would of given 5 stars but I'm not very fond of the shoulder strap, although it is easy to modify. Great little purse, I have two of them (black and brown). Great for taking a few things out on the town"
4.0,Getaway vacation.
4.0,I like the shirt but a little to small
4.0,The climbers look beautiful but the clasp on the top is not comfortable
4.0,"I normally wear 36x32 and originally ordered size L.  Not in the market for running tights that shrink wrap one's ugly fruit, but not wanting them too baggy either.  The Large were far too tight from the thighs up for my liking, so I exchanged for XL.  They are still a tad more snug than I would prefer from waist to upper thigh, but overall pleased.  Like some others, I cut off the stirrups to make them more comfortable, and the length is about right.  Ran in weather of upper 30s and found them to be sufficiently warm once I got going."
4.0,"I bought these gloves as a gift for my wife. They came in a really nice box as advertised, are actually really nice leather! The rabbit fur at the wrist clashes a bit with the glove, but over all they look great on her hands. She said they fit well and are soft on the inside. My wife is very sensitive to any seems inside socks, shirts, and gloves. So they really measure up to high expectations for comfort. Where we live it has been down to 32 degrees lately, but these gloves, as thin as they are, keep her warm yet allow her to text and answer her phone without trouble. For the price, I think the quality measures up."
4.0,"Nice and comfortable but still a little baggy, though not too much. Still looks fantastic."
4.0,"It was really pretty, but extremely big.  It was so big, it would have only worked over a dress and I wanted to wear it over shorts with a tank.  I reordered it in a small and gave the other one away.<br /><br />I did receive the small that I ordered.  It is short but still very big.  The lace really is pretty though.  You can't beat the price on it either."
4.0,Nice and mostly comfortable. Is a little snug on my head and smashes my nose too much to wear it for too long.
4.0,It was great for a cocktail event !
4.0,Very warm. I liked it.
4.0,good product just what I expected
4.0,Love these! They don‚Äôt come with actual earring backs just the little clear silicone ones. They don‚Äôt irritate my newly pierced ears overall recommend!
4.0,Installed medal in military shadow box. Got here on time and it looks good.
4.0,I can only say that the merchant is too lazy to put up more information about this product! It's too long if we don't have a long torso! But I love the color and the design that the small skirt can cover my butt :)
4.0,Very cute but runs too small
4.0,My 11 year old loves these sneakers!! He is excited to go back to school to show off his new sneakers! They fit well and seem to be well made.
4.0,Nice top. Xxl a bit too big but xl too small. Will try throwing in dryer. Colors are great.
4.0,"I'm a big madrid fan and I like to run. It gets pretty blistery during the winter months in Queens, NY. This keeps me warm while I rep the galacticos. I'm not crazy about how I look when I wear it but it's better to be warm than look silly. I recommend...hala madrid!"
4.0,"Fabric on this dress does not have alot of give - Ordered a small and it looks very good on but it is a bit tight in the chest.  5'4"" 115 lbs, chest is a 34.  The dress looks great on but just a little snug feeling around the chest and arms.  I think a medium would have been too large though."
4.0,"Wallets are one of the things that I seem to update twice a decade, if that. It's one of the items you shouldn't really skimp on, for that reason.<br /><br />I had a worn-down black leather bifold I've carried since sometime before I was in my 30's (best estimate I can provide). Worked amazing and lasted. It was showing its age and a replacement was needed.<br /><br />What I wanted: a brown, full leather, bifold that was constructed nicely. I skipped all the &#60;$20 bargains and went with the moderate-high options on Amazon. The included RFID was a definite plus with this item. What honestly sold me was a fellow reviewer saying it smelled nice.<br /><br />The wallet came in a classy gift box, completely protected with paper sheets between each layer inside the wallet. It has ample room (I have a ton of credit cards and membership cards that I usually have to omit). The ID (two-sided) is robust as well. The currency pocket is lined very nicely.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars? There is a large gap in the center of the currency pocket, allowing any small items (or folded bills) to possibly fall out. For the price, they could have stitched a liner patch here. Also, my previous wallets have always included two pockets for currency (some of us still use one for money and the other to collect receipts for business purposes!). Again, for the price, it was a let down.<br /><br />The wallet as a whole is great, and I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband. I wasnt expecting the spikes to be fabric, and for some people with huge heads, the red band may be too short.  For my husband though it fits just right. The metal ensignia is the perfect size),  and whike i expected metal spikes i imagine the fabric is safer."
4.0,No complaints from my daughter.  Loves the look.
4.0,This is a well made charm/key chain for a special friend or relative.  These words are an inspiration that lets someone know that you're there for them.  Through thick or thin / in good times and bad.  The cross comes in a gift box.
4.0,Love everything about this dress. No regrets
4.0,"Much better than I expected, Using it on wood."
4.0,"I look like a monkey, :(l)"
4.0,"These are a little difficult to get on.  But the material is thick, sturdy and stays in place once on.  They are lightweight and well constructed."
4.0,Shirts were very comfortable and fit perfectly just not a fan of the pockets
4.0,"Love shirt, but the lace at side, at arm pit, will have to be tracked down."
4.0,Lenses arrive on time and fit perfectly to my frames
4.0,Just like the picture ...<br />It comes in a little gift jewelery bag to keep safe .<br />#Nice.<br />I got this for my mom who really wanted it and couldn't find it anywhere else.<br /><br />Came FAST.
4.0,Loved this outfit. It fits just right. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and wear a size 2 in jeans and sm/med shirt. Ordered a Small.
4.0,"it took two tries to get the right size but once I did I was very please.  I purchased these to assist with recovery from gut surgery. It was recommended that I get a support shirt ( and the medical ones were very expensive).  I was able to purchase 3 shirts in the various color and wear one, wash one and have one ready. these are long enough and are light enough that I can wear them comfortably in Houston in July.<br />Not sure they have enough support for work out - but I love them for me.<br />Note - Read the sizing its not what you expect, when you take the time to pick the right size you will get what you need."
4.0,"It's Great for Dr who fans ., really cute ."
4.0,"Good, plain black socks for cheap."
4.0,"These served me well while skiing, kept my feet nice and warm. The other Smartwool sock I have are a lot thinner than these, so I expected these to be the same."
4.0,It for for sure but if you are wearing a blazer it would be nice for shirt to come fitted.
4.0,Very warm and looks good
4.0,"The product looks good, grandson liked it, but said he would like the thing to at least make noise or light up then he would love it"
4.0,Pretty but not as stretchy as I expected.  The lace is pretty and I love the v neck.  It is very flattering.  Pair over a brightly colored tank top for a striking look.  Overall very flattering.
4.0,It's a nice wallet.  But it's a bit difficult to get the credit cards out if you use all the slots.
4.0,"First belt sewing came apart in section where belt was bent back to fit.  Manufacturer/seller replaced belt and sent additional one and extra buckles to insure customer satisfaction.  We appreciate that and hope these new ones stay together.  Will try to update at a later date.  Does have strong magnets, belt and buckle material."
4.0,I bought a large I needed a medium
4.0,"It's super sparkly and pretty! I just wanted the gems to be bigger, but it'll do for now. It does catch more easily on things tho so be careful!"
4.0,Was the perfect gift for the 5 year old I purchased it for. He got his plants VS. zombies and I did not spend a lot of $$$$.
4.0,"Nice hat,  the cap is a bit tight on my head."
4.0,Fit as expected. Not too tight and not too small. The size chart helped a lot!
4.0,"Luckily I read the reviews before purchasing, so I knew to buy 2 sizes larger than my normal fit. Because of this they fit fine! Would buy again."
4.0,Bought for our 4 year old grandson for his birthday.  He LOVED them!  The one thing I noticed is the capes on the socks have no hem (just cut material) so hope they don't ravel.
4.0,The outfit is super cute. Great material !!! Looks exactly like the image and feels great . The only compliant I have is that the bottoms are a little big. I like my clothes to be fitted. However the top fits perfect.
4.0,Great for the price. They fit well.
4.0,"This was the cutest and got a lot of compliments asking me where I found it. However, I did order a size smaller and that was still big on her. But it was still great for what I needed."
4.0,Cute but definitely should‚Äôve went up a size
4.0,"Dress fit perfect even with curvy figure. Possibly could have ordered a small for a more snug fit, typically I order medium.  I am 5 foot tall and dress comes just to Knee,  so if you are tall this dress may be slightly short on you."
4.0,"This earrings are very cute, but very, very small. You definitely get what you paid for here. These would be good earrings for a small child or as a second piercing in the ear or cartilage earring."
4.0,"I ordered this suit to wear for swim lessons I registered for.  Unfortunately the lessons are not until December so I will not be able to comment on how well the suit holds up.  However, following the other reviews I read I followed the size chart and ordered a 4XL (size 16) and it fits perfectly.  It was a little difficult to get the top part up but that was probably more user error than the suit's fault :).  The bra inserts are removable so I took those out right away and liked the way it looked much better.  Seems to be well constructed and I won't need to worry about anything popping out or not getting proper coverage."
4.0,great shoe led lights work great run a little small though
4.0,"Packaged very nicely, the adjustable belt needs to be upgraded (has a cheap look), Apron is lightweight, it's not a $50 dollar Apron, but overall I'm happy with it."
4.0,"These works well.  We have lost the ball that adjusts the length on quite a few of them, but they are still functional.  They are great for when you have to go in and out of buildings a lot."
4.0,"I work for an employer in a modest country ( Saudi Arabia) and this dress was too form fitting. So, if you're into clubbing or something like that....order your size and it'll kinda hug all your curves. For work, order a size up."
4.0,"This has been my edc watch for over 3 years. Watch face has almost no scratches, but the outer edges have quite a bit of wear.<br />Pro:<br />Durability<br />Dependability<br />Easy to read<br />Solar powered<br />Atomic time keeping<br />Smallish size<br />Looks<br /><br />Cons:<br />Barometer and altimeter doesn‚Äôt work very well.<br />Compass is kinda hard to use.<br />Strap gets sweaty and warm<br /><br />Overall, I would buy this watch again."
4.0,"The pearl is pretty, sits at just below the ear lobe,  and the gold is a nice change from silver, but placing the earring into the ear is made difficult because of the short length. If the latter was just a little longer I would give it 5 stars.  I'm sure that my granddaughter will enjoy wearing these, as her hands are much smaller than mine and she hopefully will have less of a difficulty in putting them on!"
4.0,"Love the quality, just a bit on the large side."
4.0,It is a darling &#34;little&#34; purse. Little is the key here. But if that's what you are looking for it's cute. I ended up giving it to my 13 year old because it just is so small with short straps almost like a play purse. Not at all practical. It can barley fit a wallet my phone and maybe a lip gloss. I should have read the dimensions a little better
4.0,"Very good high quality watch band. I'm still getting it broken in so that it bends easily. Looks nice with my Citizen watch. I would recommend this band for a nice, affordable band."
4.0,"The ears were kind of small, but cute overall. Worked well for my needs."
4.0,"They fit as tight as I wanted. I wish they were a bit longer as I am a 6‚Äô tall female. This is fine as I am Only wearing them under my scrubs. If I were Using them to workout, I would definitely size up. I typically wear an XL."
4.0,cute shirt - happy with purchase - nothing spectacular or bad
4.0,Nice dress! Fits good!
4.0,"I'm a new portrait photographer and wanted the wings to use while shooting babies.  The ordering process was easy, the delivery was fast and the wings are perfect.  I was very pleased and will probably be ordering more in the future."
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01EJEXSF6 Soxick¬Æ Men's HD Polarized Night Driving Aviator Wayfarer Sport Sunglasses Gold Yellow Color]]<br /><br />Build quality: 4/5<br />Value for money: 4/5<br /><br />Overall it works as advertised (better vision during night time). It is light and has a snug fit. I personally think you are paying much for the packaging of this product since it is very nice. For $32 I think they should include a set of spare lens and I will purchase another set for the full amount.<br /><br />Do I recommend buying it? If you fancy the aggressive design, then yes. If you are just looking for plain driving lenses, there are cheaper options out there.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review based upon my own testing and experiences."
4.0,"Wrap is a one size fits all , so it was as expected.  Light , feels well, and Velcro holds very good.  Ordered 2 and glad I did.  Would recommend."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very soft, comfortable sweatshirt but it is very light. I was expecting it to be a bit warmer but it is nice nonetheless."
4.0,This is very pretty. It seems a bit small but can‚Äôt wait for my daughter to use it for ballet!
4.0,"Overall a nice fitting shirt for the money. My only gripe is the huge collar. I realize that it's fashionable for some, but for me it comes off like some 1970's disco look."
4.0,"Nice bracelet. Makes my fitbit look all fancy like. I do have largish wrists and this just barely fit, but still nice."
4.0,"These cute orange heart shaped sunglasses are perfect for a little girl.<br />I was going to give these to my niece who is 8, but these are really small, almost a toddler sized sunglasses.<br />Cute little colored heart graphics on the arms of the sunglasses.<br />I would consider these to be a dollar store type quality.<br />The price point is a little higher than I would expect to pay for them.<br />I received these complimentary in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I ordered this for my wife.  A large is just a bit too big for my wife  (She is 5' 3"" tall and 155lb)  The length is about perfect as it comes just above her knee but the sleeves are a hair too long.  She planned on wearing it with sweaters in the winter which is why she ordered a large.  The medium might have been a better choice.<br /><br />The coat is very lightweight.  It does little to keep you warm.  It is a nice coat to wear but mostly for looks.  The fabric is not soft and almost scratchy on bare skin.<br /><br />The drawstring is nice, it is captured everywhere except the front.  (It is unlikely to fall out)"
4.0,"A little bigger than I wanted, but it's a good purse with lots of info for all my &#34;stuff&#34;.  I need three large interior pockets and a couple of smaller pickets on the inside.  This was perfect in that respect.  Well worth the money."
4.0,Great so far!  I liked the color and the quality of the material and I'm sure that with continued use these will be perfect aprons.
4.0,"The laces look nice, but they are fairly stiff, so they tend to come loose."
4.0,"This is a great little watch. Small and sleek and easy to read. The band is a little small, though. If you don't have super tiny wrist, it is fairly uncomfortable. For me it barely fits on the last hole and doesn't leave any strap left to tuck in."
4.0,Fit too the tee. Warm comfy
4.0,"Love this dress. I'm barely 5'3 and had to spend hours hemming, but it was worth it."
4.0,Much larger than I thought it would be. Very nice piece regardless.
4.0,"My son loves the look and how he can put on like a banana when it's not a mask.  However it is a little big for him, he is your average sized 9 almost 10 year old."
4.0,Material is well put together for a costume. Love the colors. Size seems true.
4.0,These look great but they are heavy and pull down  your piercing opening . Would advise removing them  after wearing them out.
4.0,"Bought the 3X so it could stretch with pregnancy, fits well, I love the length. 4 stars because the picture made it look more orange than it is, in reality it's more pinkish-orange, like a dark coral."
4.0,Of the material comfortable not very fond of the design but it is classy and comfortable material.
4.0,"Size great, zippers are difficult to open and close on the smaller pockets. Overall fit our needs."
4.0,These were great. Bought for Vegas trip. Only down fall was they were a little big and had to tie the ear pc. So that it fit smaller
4.0,"Shipping is very slow I could have walk there to get it faster, almost forgot that I ordered it when it came in three weeks later. As far as the necklace it was pretty but can not read some of the words cause of how small they are."
4.0,"Very cute, comfortable, and fits well. But the red is more of an orange/red not a true red."
4.0,"Not made the best-it‚Äôs not completely finished off professionally. Colors & size right on. Kept suit,"
4.0,"Love the dress style, material, color.  Had to have the bodice altered.  A little hard to put on and take off, but overall pleased and would purchase from this seller again."
4.0,This cardigan sweater is SO WARM! I usually wear XL in shirts and it fit snugly. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the weird smell but it's not too terrible to deal with.
4.0,"I boughy this as a birthday gift for my best friend for her Pandora charm bracelet. Overall it looked okay. On the back where the stones were, some spots look like they were missing, but after examining it a little more closely it looks that way because of the heart shape."
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful dress, and I actually like the material, though it's a little stiff. It was just too small in the bust. Not meant for a girl with D's like me. I returned it, but I really wish I could have kept it! Very very pretty."
4.0,The product is nice and a good buy.
4.0,Runs large so buy a size smaller. Didn‚Äôt return/exchange as she would ultimately grow into it and it‚Äôs just too cute!
4.0,Purchase this for my husband nice quality he likes it
4.0,Fits perfect but a lighter shade than the picture. More of a mint green. Definitely a casual dress
4.0,"I got this today and I would have given it 5 stars but the clasp on it is horrible. I opened it up with great difficulty and then it wouldn't close again. If I had a way to give part of a star I would. It's much bigger than I thought it would be and it has a chain made up of 2 different kinds of chain which is kind of weird but it works for what I wanted. The broken clasp is no big deal because the chain is so long that it will go over my head no problem without a clasp. I actually only found out the clasp was so bad because I opened it to remove the extender chain at the back. Over all I bought this to use for a time traveler Steampunk costume so the size makes it better, the 2 kinds of chain made it easier to add in gears to achieve the look, and the clasp being broken doesn't matter to me because I was able to remove the clasp altogether. :)"
4.0,"These fit comfortable loose and fabric is light & soft. I really enjoy wearing them. But wish they were more wrinkle-free, you know what I'm saying? Who likes to iron these days?"
4.0,"I like the color, easy to see when the bag comes down the carousel.  However, the strange shape means if you want to put a business card inside, you have to cut the corner off.  I like that only your name is showing if you use their supplied card, but I will always want one of my business cards inside as someone could call at any time and leave a message or talk to someone.  Looks like it will last, the wire seems strong and should be airport abuse resistant."
4.0,"They are good quality but waaaaaay too big for the wrist, its almost comical"
4.0,"I was happy with the charcoal , grey and green hoodies. The fabric was soft, like a tee shirt or sweatshirt. The arms are very long on ALL of them. The red and the blue were a totally different fabric and were very tight in the upper arm and chest in the medium and large size. Recommend going up 2 sizes on those colors. So small I decided to give it to a teenager instead of a woman. I dont have large arms either.Bummer!! Wish I knew this before I purchased those colors.Have no idea why the same item would be a different fabric. They were loose and comfortable everywhere else. You could not put additional layers underneath on the blue and red/wine. Hoodie part looks weird out of the box but totally works when you put it on. Cute! 2 stars on the blue and  red/wine , 4 stars on the others!"
4.0,"They are cute and I get a lot of compliments...the backs should be tighter though, they literally fall right off.  I have to use backs I already have."
4.0,"I like these clips.  I saw similar clips in a local department store for $25 each!  Pass.  I lose these, so getting three at a time makes life much easier."
4.0,It does run very small so you may want to go up in size. I bought a XXL and I wear a size 12. It was very snug. The support and quality is very good for the price!
4.0,"I love this dress!!! Its so cute and definitely looks sexy while still being kind of modest lol. My only small complaint is that it's kind of short. I'm 5'2"" and this dress barely comes to my mid thigh. But it's still a beautiful dress and it's now my new favorite date night, sexy little black dress üòäüòä"
4.0,Beautiful dress and fits well nice summer formal dress
4.0,"Runs small, came with a small hole in it as well it worked for the night mask was hard to see out of I literally had to zip this up for my son as well as help him get out of it he is 5ft 6in and 115 we ordered mens medium"
4.0,material is thin! but cute top for going out with your girls!
4.0,"Although somewhat large and long based on the measurements, it is a nice set that works well for the look Im aiming to achieve.  I like that the pearls are fastened on with tools not glued."
4.0,price match as far as the hat but the speaker system is great
4.0,"Great lenses, nice and clear. Seems the frames are tough, but they are very much plastic. I am not sure how the lenses attach, but when you torque the frames there is noise and the lenses do move, but they have not fallen out."
4.0,"Nice thick material. Well made. Fit pretty well. I ordered large, and I am a size US  10.5. They fit snugly.<br /><br />I reordered another pair.<br /><br />Would recommend"
4.0,"Item as described, seems of good quality. Don't know if it really blocks RFID -- don't have equipment to test that. Passport fits snugly and securely."
4.0,"I would say these are ok. I got them for my 16 year son hoping he would be able to put the watch on easier. He can put it on easier, but it must be loosen for him to get it over his hand. He still has a difficult time tighten it back up once on his arm."
4.0,"These socks are very comfy and don't slip off my heels which I love! I can wear my Vans and Nikes without any sock showing. After the first wash though, they felt a bit tighter. I can see my feet through the material so I wonder how long they'll last, especially with my toes feeling a little more snug after that wash. Overall they serve the purpose I bought them for, but I don't know how durable they will be."
4.0,"I really like the fit of this top, i ordered a large, and it was perfect! Its really comfortable. Not bad for the price!"
4.0,"The product is surprisingly in good quality for the price. The texture is very nice and soft. The blouse is somewhat see-through so I would recommend wearing an undershirt, especially if you're a busty girl. There is one button that was sown backwards but it doesn't seem to interfere with anything so I am guessing it was mistake, and there are a few loose threats but nothing scissors cannot fix . Overall it is a good blouse that can be use for casual wear or professional wear. Would definitely recommend. For reference I am 5'5 140lb with a bust size of 36 , and I bought an L, would recommend going a size larger if you are a busy girl."
4.0,I liked the product because the shirt felt like a sweater with no sleeves and the shirt fit perfectly fine given I'm a big chested individual.
4.0,"I really like this dress. It's very sexy. It's very well made and The fabric is nice and thick. I just wish the straps stayed on my shoulders a little better, i felt like they were sliding off and i had to keep fixing them."
4.0,Great fit. They did get a film on the lenses. Still really liked them.
4.0,I absolutely love this dress. It is very flattering and comfortable
4.0,"Super cute hat! I saw a girl wearing this at Universal Studios in LA and desperately tried to find it in all of the gift shops! The fit is pretty universal and can be adjusted accordingly. I was actually weary about buying it before trying it on because my head is slightly smaller than the average person.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that the inner lid is GREEN! I'm not sure why the manufacturer didn't just keep it red...but it's the only thing about the hat that's off. The seller should definitely advertise that part of the hat. But if you ca get over the green, the hat is a great buy."
4.0,Cute and lightweight. Not the highest quality or softest but still comfy
4.0,Fits good on the rest of the little staff in a little bit smaller than the last one I purchased
4.0,looks sexy
4.0,"I love these lightweight, bright and colorful<br />Glasses! They are fun to wear with that special bright outfit on a beautiful sunny day!"
4.0,"A bit thin, but very cute."
4.0,"After searching on amazon for hours, I finally decided to give this bag a try.<br /><br />I was looking for a leather duffle bag that could carry my clothing over the weekend. The bag did arrived with a really strong odor, but after two days of letting the bag outdoors inside out the smell eventually diminish. It does feel cheap, yet after taking it to numerous trips the duffel bag has handle perfectly well. This bag will carry your clothing in a more masculine way and do the same job as a $200 dollar plus bag could do."
4.0,It is a visor what can i say..quality is ok..functions as expected
4.0,-1 star for it being too hard to put on by the kid by themselves.
4.0,My granddaughter wears a 2-3T.  I should have gotten  a 4T.
4.0,It's ok not that keeps you warm on - 5 degrees<br />I like the style and fits good
4.0,"Lovely little pocket watch necklace...to wear just for fun.  I had a little problem, and the company in China was very cooperative, and  sent me a replacement . I appreciated their helpfulness."
4.0,This is a very nice quality fleece. I love how it fits. It is warm and pretty thick. I am wearing a medium here and it fits true to size. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 164lbs.<br /><br />I will say that it sheds a little. I have since washed it and air dried it and it still looks great!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend!
4.0,a little bit bigger than expected and it slips off his feet but he can always grow into them and they look great!
4.0,Beautiful neutral w/o being boringly tan. The faux reptile and textured leather is attractive and the fit is perfect. I have been 'skating' lately on tile floors with tracked-in sand in the tropics and these soles actually keep me upright!
4.0,Really soft and comfortable but bigger than expected
4.0,"I received so many compliments in this dress. I ordered a large, but probably could have gotten a medium. I am 5‚Äô1 140 lbs."
4.0,Very comfortable and sexy!
4.0,"Love it! It's subtle enough that I feel comfortable wearing it everywhere, and it fit all my essentials comfortably. It's by no means a big bag, but it gets the job done! The white can a bit dirty, and the unicorn became scratched up pretty quickly, but overall great purchase!"
4.0,"Kind of thin but not bad, and I would get a size down they were bigger than expected"
4.0,Shirts were smaller than expected
4.0,"I like it. For the price, it's pretty good."
4.0,"Too long for me, I would typically need short, so my own fault for not looking for short length."
4.0,Okay chain but the clasp is pretty cheap. It wouldn't stay closed on its own.
4.0,"I normally wear a medium, go a size up to large for comfort but I sort of wish I'd bought the extra-large. The X-large wasn't prime and I wanted this sent sooner.  Although this size will do. Sleeves are long enough and it's a cute shirt for wearing over a tank top & great for layering. I will take care washing it so it doesn't shrink. It's not fancy but a good casual shirt."
4.0,Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it
4.0,"I love this hat! I've been wearing it since I got it, keeps my head warm, and I can fit it to the look I'm going for, I'm glad I purchased it, I should have gotten a black one too."
4.0,"I'm short but leggings did its job. Had to wear black leggings underneath since the white stripes was somewhat see through..leggings were kinda long but I just folded the bottom of the leggings, which works for my height."
4.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry. It sparkles in sun like and beautiful blue.
4.0,Took a bit to get used to wearing but seemed to work well with a backless dress I bought. Stayed the whole night despite heat and humdity
4.0,It compresses better than I expected.  It is also the right width.
4.0,"For the price I was really expecting a cheap necklace, but it is actually nice. It is a gift for my daughter so I wasn't looking for anything expensive in case she broke it. The name isn't large and overpowering. The chain has a couple loops to adjust the length. The box that it comes in is nice enough to use as is for a gift. Not sure yet how it will hold up long term, but again for the price it is great."
4.0,Thus is a great buy & it shipped really quick there's alot of jewelry the only thing I don't like is there's not alot of choices but it's still great & I definitely recommend for anyone that has alot of piercings like me
4.0,I didnt like this too much because I thought the material would be more like cotton....but it's kinda cheap material that to me has a oily feel to it. My husband on the other hand LOVES this on me says it is very flattering...and loves the feel of it...
4.0,Good product not for me
4.0,I purchased a size medium and it fit perfectly.
4.0,Cute and nice material but it runs small/short.
4.0,"I just like the fact, the logo on the face mask"
4.0,it looks beautiful. it looks like a designer watch. but the wrist band look cheap.
4.0,"I ordered the dress the listing labels as Purple ‚Äì A2. This dress is really pretty. I would call the color more magenta or pink than purple. The straps are solid black and there is a black band that goes under the bust. On the sides of the black band there is a black belt. This is long and can tie in the back. The pink fabric has huge white flowers with black outlines on them. These flowers are really pretty. I love the bold pattern. The straps are wide but the angle of them means that you cannot easily hide bra straps with them. The sides under the arms come down a little lower than I would like.<br />I ordered this dress in a medium, which is my normal size. I am about 5‚Äô6.5‚Äù tall and weigh about 135-140 pounds. The medium fits well. I wear a sticky backless strapless bra with this dress. This means that my bra straps don‚Äôt show and bras don‚Äôt show under my arms.  The dress comes down to just above my ankles. It is flattering, but not too form fitting. It is really comfortable. This dress is made from a slightly stretchy fabric. It is machine washable and you can dry it in the dryer. The colors are bold and bright making it a great summer dress.<br /><br />I received a discount on this dress in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Great set of shades for the price. The look just as good as raybans for a fraction as much. They are a bit too dark Imo that is why it gets 4 not 5.
4.0,"Cute, a little loose but material feels good. Would order again!"
4.0,Fits good n looks good. Good enough.
4.0,This is a very comfortable sweat suit. It washes and dries without any shrinking.
4.0,Product was too small for the size I always wear.  I liked it and sending for a larger size.
4.0,"Im a medium, but this Large sweater fit like a slim fit medium.  Comments say sizes run small so I went with large to play it safe.  Now I'm having to return it and get an 'xl', which I'm guessing would be a medium if sizes were standardized or at the very least measured and assigned reasonably, otherwise its a legitimate knit sweater, heavy quality and seems durable.  It is not aa screen printed sweatshirt."
4.0,I wish it was a tad bigger to hold a water bottle and be able to zip.<br />Other than that it's amazing
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up but it fits big, should have ordered true  to my size. Nice quality material.  Overall nice"
4.0,"This backpack was very cute and held up very well! The straps were a little short. I thought the way they zippered into one strap was really unique and cool. I didn't really like the huge bow on the front because it's not my style, so i just took it off. This bag is really cute though, and I would buy another one of these products."
4.0,"it's actually what i've expected ,will order a higher size"
4.0,Thought it was a cream crochet bit it is true white.
4.0,"The dress fits really well. It‚Äôs flows nicely. I don‚Äôt know if I didn‚Äôt look well but I was pleasantly surprised to see it came with the dress to wear either as a slip or it‚Äôs cute enough to go on its own.. so it‚Äôs a TWO-FOR! The outter dress was shedding threads all day long which was irritating and strange, however, it didn‚Äôt seem to have any negative affect on the dress. Overall great purchase"
4.0,It's really beautiful and fits my ankle. I like it!
4.0,"Fast service, not as pretty in person as in the picture, ran small.  Fast service!"
4.0,VERY Nice.
4.0,"Cute shirt, but more fitted than expected."
4.0,It's a gift... looks good to me
4.0,I like to wear this top over a tank top.  I'm sure it will also go great with a long-sleeve top when the weather gets cooler.
4.0,The Royal blue color is magnificent!  Great compliments on the dress.  Sexy and classy enough for the Christian woman I am...still got my swag!
4.0,Not very stretchy but look nice.  Somewhat on the small side.
4.0,It looked bigger on Amazon then it is
4.0,Nice guality and excellent service..
4.0,"This hangs very nicely, quite a flattering style, really like this sweater"
4.0,"These slippers are very cute, made well and have a thick rubber sole on them. The only thing i dislike is the rear of the shoe is a little low so they fall off easily."
4.0,"I returned this item and got my credit already. I dont have an issue with returning except it took forever for amazon to receive it back. It looks cute and i'll probably wear it if I'm 14 but i'm turning 33 this year so it looks tacky on me now. I should've research more so i cant blame anyone but me. Its a little heavy so when you move your head, its hard not to be reminded that you're wearing it. The silver is too light that it looks so cheap. Pretty design but for my age, it should be a antique-ish color for me to pull off a dangling chandelier-type earrings."
4.0,"Small pockets, opening is about 3.5 inches. Is longer then most. Runs small, order a size or two bigger. Material is light weight and airy."
4.0,I love this watch. It just came in the mail and im so in love. Only thing bad i have to say is that it came with a dead battery. Can someone please send me a new battery for my new watch please?
4.0,"We like them, they look super cute and comfy. I had to return the first time I bought them and get a sis up. My daughter is two and a half and I bought size 4t for her"
4.0,As Described!
4.0,"Once I wore them they became looser on my foot.  I remember back as a teenager, I had a similar pair.  Your could wet them, and they would shrink back again.  So, I tried it with this pair‚Ä¶it worked!"
4.0,I'm 5'4 so the length is a little longer than I hoped.  Hits me mid shin.  But it's comfy and not clingy to the body.  I got the orange and the color is very pretty
4.0,"Perfect size for my needs.  Not to small, not so large as to be heavy to wear cross body. Love it."
4.0,"This skirt is absolutely beautiful! I wish it was made better. I am 5'4 130lbs, usually a size 4 or 6. I ordered a large based on the other reviews. It fit good around the waist but i had to be constantly pulling it down troughtout the night. I wouldnt wear it without tights underneath..."
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute jacket it‚Äôs a little snug and the color is not gray it‚Äôs more of a light blue
4.0,Cute and pretty.
4.0,Looks totally different from the photo
4.0,The dress fits wonderfully but the pockets are cut wierd and bulk out.
4.0,Good quality...very happy with purchase
4.0,I thought that they would be larger. I‚Äôll keep them. They are made well
4.0,Cute easy dress
4.0,"Excelente tela y calidad, era lo esperado"
4.0,"I was given this necklace as a gift. I love it. It's one of my favorite necklaces. It's beautiful but not too flashy. I'm a big fan of key necklaces, yet I don't like ones with a lot of diamonds or sparkle. I prefer a more natural look. This one is perfect. However... I'm afraid I can't give it five stars, because it has started to tarnish. It makes me sad to see one of my favorite necklaces losing it's color. I'm not quite sure when it started to happen, but my necklace is probably close to two years old and I have worn it a lot. Even so, I've taken good care of it, so I'm disappointed it's no longer as beautiful as it once was."
4.0,"I purchased this protection plan for my wife's pearls since we've got little kids who like to get into her jewelry box.  The chances are high that they might snap the string or the clasp. I haven't had to use the plan yet, but I've advised my wife to keep all the pearls together if it gets broken, since this plan doesn't cover replacing missing pearls, it'll just repair the necklace hardware. Not an entirely useless plan, but if you don't have all the pearls, your necklace won't be fully restored by this plans coverage.<br /><br />I'll update this review if I have to use the plan."
4.0,"The kids really like these happy, adjustable rings.  The rings are very cute."
4.0,There nice get one
4.0,tallas muy chicas ..no me gusto el material
4.0,I received my tallit yesterday. First one I've owned. Very nice quality and design. Vibrant colors. Would like to use it for special occasions since it is a very beautiful piece but since it's my only tallit I'll use it during my personal Bible readings in the morning (my special time with God).
4.0,"I only have a couple of shirts that need/use cufflinks, and it was nice to give these a try. they look nice and received a nod of approval from the missus. That's good enough for me.<br /><br />The seller, in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, supplied me with this product or gave it at a discount.<br /><br />What you have read is solely my very honest opinion based on my expertise and experience with this product.<br /><br />If you have additional questions do not hesitate to ask!"
4.0,I like the fit. I‚Äôm a size 10 so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find a good fit for my body and this works for me.
4.0,I would give this a five star but because of personal taste I don't like big prints.  I am 5' tall 116 points and 69.  This fit great and so comfortable.  Ater washing no ironing needed.  Just wonderful material.  Worth the money.
4.0,Looks great but wats wrinkled up at the bottom
4.0,Super cute bag with large pockets.  The color is so soft and pretty.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the inside is already starting to fray.  This bag is a great deal for the price!
4.0,"Nice, good length but gets dirty fast being such a light color. Color is lighter in person than in pictures."
4.0,"Cute top, the fit is great too.  I ordered this in a medium the color was brighter than I anticipated.  I ordered the gray top as well and the color is perfect."
4.0,"The draw string is kinda cheap, so I just removed it. The shorts are soft and great quality! Shipping takes a few weeks, so don‚Äôt expect them quick."
4.0,"Fitted and long, but nice color. Darker than the picture and not all cotton. More spandex material and somewhat sheer."
4.0,Have had about a month and have had many compliments. Material is good quality. Only problem was a inside zipper splits sometimes but I never use it anyway.
4.0,"Fits as expected, material is not too thin. For the price it is good. The hem is much more un-even than the picture shows, but it is still a good dress."
4.0,"Runs a little small, but is very long. It fits my child better than it fits me."
4.0,"Really soft and comfortable material. Buttons could be a little better, they come open on their own at times but overall happy with the purchase"
4.0,"Nice flowy material. Hangs nicely. Length is nice and long. I'm 5'9, 185 pounds, 38DDD and I bought a XL. Fabric is pretty sheer, though, so the lighter the color the more easily you can see through it."
4.0,I LIKE TO WEAR THIS WHEN I KNOW THE BIRDS ARE MIGRATING TO THE SOUTH
4.0,Haven‚Äôt used yet.  But looks good. Only  comment is I wish it was a little thicker - heavier.
4.0,"Before I received it.<br />I lost 60 lbs! All my clothing need to be taken in. This main reason it did not receive 5 stars is because, it is thick, heavy, unbreathable(  it made me stink) 100% polyester!"
4.0,Overall this is a very cute sweater! ^o^ but be careful so it doesn't get snagged on anything.
4.0,Its a very beautiful shoe. But not comfortable. Because on and off button  is make pain.
4.0,"I was looking for a thick rugby, and this was just what I wanted. The light green stripe is a little more saturated than the picture looks, but it's a great shirt."
4.0,"Actually really pretty in person, easy to clean, easy to use. This item ended up being the patient's favorite out of the bunch and is still in use today."
4.0,Leather is thick and well sewn. Pouches are roomy and zippers seem solid. My Samsung smart phone fits the phone pouch when naked but not when in its OtterBox. I am happy.
4.0,"Serves its purpose, but looks kind of cheap"
4.0,These sunglasses fit a little big but I love how they block the sunlight and how clear I can see with them.
4.0,"Very cute staple, good with a belt and jacket."
4.0,El material de la tela y su estampado
4.0,"I am a very small teen, and it fits just a bit big, but I get lots of compliments bc it is so cute!"
4.0,Have to return for smaller size
4.0,It was a Christmas event and a last minute purchase. The dress ran big I ordered a large<br />It was a simple fix with some easy placed safety pins. It was still roomy in the boobs and tummy areas but extremely comfortable.
4.0,"I wasn't expecting this dress to be a wrap dress for some reason. It's very cute and great for someone whose style is more flirty. However it is a very sheer material. While the dress fit okay at the waist, it was way too short and showed way too much cleavage for me."
4.0,"I've been using these cheap Casio watches since they were invented. They always give accurate time, and the bands wear out before the watches stop working.<br />I bought this one on November 22, 2021, and today, March 13, 2022, I can't change the hour to Daylight Savings Time. The seconds flash as expected, but the ""L"" button is not working to change the hours or minutes.<br />I will have to mentally change the time by an hour until I get a new watch. For an under $15 watch, it's not worth the time or expense to get it repaired. Is it?<br />Any suggestions on how to get it working again?"
4.0,Ordered Gold dress recived a pink dress everything els was perfect the dress is beautiful it was just the wrong color!
4.0,Material is soft and dress fits as expected
4.0,Got extra product it works fine though
4.0,The shirt is very brightly colored and comfortable.  It is shorter than I prefer and not what I call a sweatshirt but I still like it and I‚Äôve had many compliments on it.  Ordered my true size that I wear.
4.0,Not as high quality as you would think from the picture. But it‚Äôs cute. Not sure if the gold color will last.
4.0,"Adequate protection for a not too cold night. Material is alright. Overall, it seems to be great for the price."
4.0,"These are super duper soft and comfy, but boy, are they large. I got these as a gift for my dad, who usually wears a size 2X, and they were way too big. They're taller than he is! Make sure to really look at the size chart before buying and be warned they might end up being super long. That doesn't stop them from being comfortable, though."
4.0,Oh boy this was my surprise how the dress was long surprise me!
4.0,"I liked the variety of colors, so I purchased as a gift for someone."
4.0,"Nice fabric and design. Although other ratings stated they ran small it was still too large. I wear an extra small, ordered the small and had to return. The fit was baggy on me."
4.0,Very comfortable but the length was a little too short even though I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and a 1/2‚Äù.
4.0,Daughter is in tumbling fits her kinda big in the groin area so she‚Äôs always ‚Äúfixing it‚Äù üëéüèª<br />Cute design üëçüèª
4.0,Really cute shirt. Fit a bit tighter than expected.
4.0,Incredibly lightweight.  Quality is comparable to the price.  Not really see through but dark chest hair is noticeable through the material.  Overall its what is advertised.
4.0,It seems I did not order the correct item--but keeping for future use.
4.0,"Good shirt. Came fast. Has a slightly purple tint to it and runs rather large. I'm normally a large and I got it but it fits like an extra large. Not bad for my situation (Halloween costume), but I would not wear it for anything else."
4.0,"I love not having a brick (normal wallet) in my pocket. It is a bit tough to get the cards out at times, so plan a few seconds ahead. I have placed 6-8 cards in between the metal and have money between band and the metal. It claims to fit up to 12 cards, but I do not plan to carry that much seeing as I am trying to minimize the size & weight."
4.0,Good mask but still can get hot
4.0,Nice scarf for the price.  Have worn it a lot already.
4.0,I have had this bag since January 2014. I really like it. It has plenty of room for anything/everything you need in a purse. I guess its pretty durable as I have used it everyday. Just this week one of the exterior zippers stopped working. I am in the process of ordering another Scarleton as I really like their style and design.
4.0,Great dresses
4.0,My cousin loved the beanie!
4.0,I would love to buy more. The price was right and they are comfortable too. I do a lot of stretching and bending these are the right fit to move in as well. Thank you
4.0,"Dress is very nice for the price and fits as expected.  Have to look into a tulle underskirt because the plastic hoops show under the material.  Also, The dress came all wrinkled so this will take special care to get it Father Daughter Dance ready!"
4.0,"The vest is a comfortable extra layer and a nice length for me. (I am 5'4"".) I ordered the black vest with black trim; I received a black vest with gray trim. Although it was not what I ordered, the vest was a reasonable price, so I kept it."
4.0,They was OK but that is all. Cheaply made and packaged. You get what you pay for.
4.0,Super pretty. Nice coral color
4.0,The pant is good and all that but from the feet is difficult since I'm 5'3 it just drags itself unless you're gonna be wearing heels. But it's okay cause I sent it out to fix it.
4.0,The sleeve is a little tight but is okay.  I love this shirt
4.0,"My wife likes it.  It is unique, and she's gotten several complements.  One issue is that the face is a little large on her wrist.  She has a slight build, but she's of average height and weight.  I almost wish there was a children's size - like the size of the old swatch watches.  The bamboo/leather combo is nice because it's understated.  A smaller size would complement the aesthetic."
4.0,My son said it was great but they should probably move the face down a bit because sometimes it's hard to see (Only sometimes..)
4.0,"The material is rather light, but they have been doing a good job<br />of keeping my pants up.  For the price.  Will buy another set."
4.0,Bought as shower shoes for the gym.
4.0,"I really like this hat. It looks just like the photo. The only drawback is that it can lose its shape easily. I fixed it by stuffing it with newspaper. Nonetheless, its cute and fuzzy. I love the leopard ears and bill. Where else do you find a hat that looks like this? It is cute and inexpensive. I enjoy it and you stand out with it on."
4.0,Perfect smell but why more expensive when in the store?
4.0,it is ok not my favorite but it fits
4.0,"It looks as expected, and comes with medical grade filters but the actual mask is huge, the fabric alone reaches my ears! You could make it work, but there‚Äôs better products to spend your money on<br /><br />edit: it‚Äôs really easy to make work and i enjoy the mask a lot, still huge though"
4.0,"These sweats fit great on my daughter, and she loves them! Problem is, they are showing wear after only a month. They are pilling and getting ratty-looking already. And the fabric attracts hair and fuzz. I think I may order again only because my daughter loves them so much, but take extra care to wash inside out & on delicate."
4.0,Great product good for the gym or whatever u want
4.0,Sizing is very accurate. I went by the size chart provided. The denim feels like decent quality we will see how it holds up after a wash but it sits at the natural waist line. Doesn‚Äôt fit too tight around the hips and isn‚Äôt too short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 130lbs with fuller hips. If you have straighter hips you might swim in it but I am very pleased with the product at this price point!
4.0,Its light and comfortable. Very flowy but the material was a little too scratchy.
4.0,"Its a very nice wallet and holds items well, good construction and nice material it was however too small to hold all of my cards so I had to unfortunately return it.<br />If you don't have a lot of stuff in your wallet I would recommend this wallet for you"
4.0,"These earrings are really beautiful, quality was excellent, but they were just way too big for me so I returned them."
4.0,this is the perfect gift for m yniece
4.0,I really like this purse but it is a little hard to zip
4.0,"Nice bathing suit, fit just right, but the clasp to hold the top up broke right when I put it on, but it's an easy fix that can be sewn."
4.0,"Nice. I have tabby cats. So, I like it!"
4.0,Fits small<br />Very soft<br />Very comfortable
4.0,Its a nice little lanyard. Cant  complain about it. The sewing quality is pretty good too.
4.0,"My feet are on the wider side, so I have a hard time finding shoes that don't pinch. These were a little too narrow for me, so I passed them to my daughter.  The heel is just the right height and stable enough for her to not feel like she will twist an ankle. The ankle tie gives them something just a little bit different. They are not the most comfortable to wear if you need to stand or walk for extended periods of time, but she doesn't do much walking around at work, so she is happy with them. I would consider trying them again if they came in wider sizes."
4.0,"Very cute boots, they run a little small. I wear 8 1/2 but I ordered a 9 after reading reviews, and the 9 fits perfect. I roll down the top to make a cuff that shows the furry lining and they aren't tight at all, perfect fit. You might need to put some inserts in the insole, as it isn't very cushioned."
4.0,"I'm an 'old guy'. Had a pierced ear since the 60's. I have had a lot of yin yang earrings of various sizes. I don't care for anything too large, but want to make a 'statement'. This is the perfect size for me."
4.0,The product is a gift. The lights don‚Äôt all work. They look like they have had a long shelf life? The shoes definitely needed to be cleaned they had a film on them. Cute for kids to wear for fun. Soft jelly shoes. Easy for kids to put on their selves.
4.0,Great vest and fits just how I wanted. Fits snug when doing box jumps and wall/jogs. I definitely recommend it and able to save a few bucks compared to other more expensive options
4.0,I loved this dress.  It was great quality and fit amazing.  It just wasn't quite right for the occasion that I was buying it for.
4.0,"Nice dress, love it! üòçüíï"
4.0,The calf and warmth were good but the suede made my sz 11 medium foot look too large. Those extra millimeters. Not sure about the authenticity of the brand. The zipper is not signature la  canadienne and the font on the sole was different than on a pair from Zappos
4.0,"It's &#34;somewhat small&#34;, but it'll stretch, I'm sure. Also, it's not the fault of the advertiser/seller, I knew there was a possibility of it not fitting correctly based on my gargantuan head. All in all, a nice hat for a decent price."
4.0,"Love the patterns and fits true to size. My kids love it and have been wearing it all summer long. It won‚Äôt last more than the season though, since they do get worn out fast, especially the printed pattern."
4.0,Looks beautiful just expected it to actually be holographic
4.0,"Love this tank, super cute and very breathable."
4.0,I seem sturdy enough time will tell if they'll last.
4.0,This anklet looks very pretty the way it lays on my ankle as long as it's not twisted itself. It looked fragile and at first I felt scared to wear it all the time because of fear of breaking it but after nearly a week of constant wear it's withstood a lot. I just hope it doesn't start to discolor my skin.
4.0,"one of the only sellers offering magnification, good stuff"
4.0,Good length nice shirt
4.0,"A little see through, depending on the size you get. If your closer to a larger size but get a smaller size it will fit but be more see through."
4.0,"I usually wear a large & with reviews ordered a XXL and it was still to small in chest & arms, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and weigh 153# I‚Äôm not a huge person. I‚Äôm still giving them 4 stars because it is really a lovely jacket, made nicely I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt wear it. The customer service was exceptional very understanding & gave me my refund quickly."
4.0,Is easy to install and sits very comfortable on my wrist highly recommended for anyone that doesn't like watch bands
4.0,It was a little bigger than expected but colors are great
4.0,Socks are comfortable and work well with some of my slip on shoes. The tops of the socks do come up too far for some of my tom's slip ons. They do not have a rubber strip across the back making them much more comfortable that my other no show socks.
4.0,My son LOVES these Sesame Street charms! They are very durable. Only reason I gave 4 stars was because the bracelet snap closure broke after a few uses. We still use it for storage to easily swap out charms.
4.0,Good features for post shoulder surgery.  Too bad the material is not cool for hot weather.  I guess 100 percent combed cotton would be too thick.
4.0,I loved the dress the fit was fine.. but not as long as I would like ...
4.0,"Nice product, but realized linen pants aren't for me."
4.0,5‚Äô3 and were still too long for me. Also the siting is a bit large I could‚Äôve gone a size smaller.
4.0,"Looked smaller than most in this size.  Bought as a gift, so hopefully it fits."
4.0,Looks just like the pic but on me it was 3-4 inches above my ankle. I wore it with knee high boots so it didn't matter. However it would look good with heels despite the length. Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because when I sat down the neckline pulled downward and cut into my shoulders which was uncomfortable.
4.0,Really nice capri but unfortunateky fit too snug.  I must return. I have ordered the next size up.
4.0,Cute combination!  I ordered a size up because I‚Äôm busty. These suits should also be offered ad separates. The color combination of this suit is pretty.
4.0,"Keep in mind that this is quite small.  At only 4' 9&#34; and 96lbs, i'm a small woman (my shoulders are a bit wide and i'm a tad muscular). it fits me, but if i were a little bigger it probably wouldn't. It'll most likely be fine for anyone 5' (maybe 5' 2&#34;) and under or if you're really skinny.  It's quality is really nice for the price.  the clasp isn't the best, but that can easily be fixed with a few quick stitches.  I'm getting married eventually and want a winter wedding so i'll be wearing this. I'm trying to save money and do a lot of DIY so this will work.  Also keep in mind that it does come from outside of the U.S. so shipping is a little longer than normal, but was quick considering how far it traveled."
4.0,Just one disclaimer that where it says Italy it actually says Italia at least what mine came in but overall it's an awesome product
4.0,Kinda thin but my sisiter loved it
4.0,Order one size up from whatever you wear in Nike sizes.
4.0,This little slipper are nice and warm. They've very soft and the nonslip sole is great for hard floors. I will say that the shape is not like the image. They're flattened and misshapen. If you massage them and prop them they can look good enough.
4.0,"This face covering is fairly lightweight and breathable. It doesn't always stay in place super well, sometimes it falls down, but the plus side of that is that it's not overly tight or restrictive either. My son really likes the red camo design. We usually wash it on cold and then lay it flat to dry."
4.0,A bit tight but they're very nice and look great. I thought these were supposed to be yoga pants material when I bought them and was a bit disappointed because they're a bit stiff and not very stretchy but they're alright.
4.0,So cute on my baby. Fabric is good.
4.0,definitely looks nice. Doesn't draw attention to self conscious areas like alot.of dresses do which makes me very relieved.<br /><br />I got the loose fit style because I was nervous of my big hips and my little stomach pouch from having kids...but now that I think of it I probably could have gotten the reg fit one. Cause I i have small boobs and it will probably need to be taken in alittle.<br />The little mini skirt underneath def rides up and will ride up...so ill probably wear little shorts underneath it...just how the slit is id be worried of it riding up too much.<br />Again not sure if it's cause i got the loose fit...but this is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise I think it looks amazing on.<br /><br />I'm 5'3 and weigh close to 140 and I got the large.
4.0,"Now I'm 5,8"" In my case its too long, cover my ass and my crotch area, I can pass with out wearing any pants and everything will be covered. I'f you taller than 5.8"" might not be as long for you. The Black is great feels thicker and falls well, the white is the worst. Feels super thin and a little see through."
4.0,"Just received this in the mail and tried it on. First, I would like to say that I was a little hesitant about ordering it after reading a few reviews. I felt like the skirt was too good to be true. I was also a little sketchy about the fabric quality since it is more of a silky polyester. It does fit well and the elastic is very snug but so far that doesn't bother me. The fabric isn't ugly... Its more silky and sporty but I do feel like you can really dress this skirt up and down however you'd like. I am wondering how it will hold up after wear and if it will snag easily based on the fabric type. I wouldn't consider it a bad buy since I've only had it for a few hours and am wearing it around the house. I do like the fact that it has pockets and if it turns out to hold up well I will be coming back for more colors. It is very breathable and seems like it would work great for all seasions since you can pair it with tights like I have on right now. So far so good. I will keep posted about the quality and wear of these."
4.0,Love this dress but the waist section is long but was able to tie waist belt tight to help with that!
4.0,"Very nice belt for the money.  It really holds up pants.  It's a little too wide to fit comfortably through a belt loop - have to thread it carefully.  Also, it tends to stretch.  I got a medium for my 38&#34; waist, and there's about 6&#34; of excess belt, so I  have to tuck into the first loop (very tight fit when two thicknesses of belt are in the loop.)"
4.0,a little lg but she like it alot
4.0,"This little velvet pajama set is DARLING and seems to be pretty decent quality. The only thing I wish I knew is to WASH IT SEPARATELY.  I threw this thing in with my darker clothes and after the wash cycle, I realized that every single article of clothing in the machine was covered in tiny velvety-glittery fibers from the fabric. I rewashed everything without this set and the fibers are still clinging to my clothes. I think the only solution now is a slew of lint brushes..."
4.0,This is made with a thin material and isn‚Äôt designed to close in the front.
4.0,This is a nice comfortable dress for work.  Fabric is a little thin so I'm not sure how long it will last but it works for the price.
4.0,Shirt picture was great quality. It was just a bit short
4.0,I thought it was much cuter in the ad. However it was a gift and my friend loved it. It had very odd straps that were hard to adjust though.
4.0,they are nice but appear overly bright and do not look like real gold because of the shine. But they were an inexpensive set and are nice for a quick dress up. Overall satisfied with purchase
4.0,This cardigan is so comfortable but it does run small. So far so good. Not flimsy and not to thick. Can wear in all weather.
4.0,Material a little rough. On time and of good quality.
4.0,"I wear Sketcher Mary Janes all the time. I bought this along with a much more expensive competitor and I must say these stayed on much better even with the lower price. I will continue to use this brand, I have tried so many brands and there actually worked."
4.0,This top fits and feels more expensive - very pretty color of blue. I could have gotten LG. I have 39&#34; bust 16' shoulder.  i will have taken in a little.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:66495347e60a0f562df98dca375891d2]] I need to dress up a bit more for work, so when I am at home, I like to wear comfortable clothes and sometimes nothing is more comfortable than pajamas.  However, I like to wear clothes that I can sleep in, and also be able to go out to run errands without changing.  This purple baggy and loose style off the shoulder shirt is very ideal. It is super soft, enough for sleeping and still be presentable for outdoor activities.  It is a bit thin, so I love layering with a tank top underneath. Sometimes my house get hot and I tends to just wear a tank top at home. This shirt is also an ideal shirt for me to quickly put on and within minutes I am ready to leave.  I did get it a size bigger because I just love the loose look on me and how not form fitting it should be.  Being a mom, getting ready fast is a must and this shirt makes me look good while doing it.<br /><br />I was chosen to review this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,My babies legs are too chunky!
4.0,I wear this every day.  It is a delicate looking bracelet and looks nice mixed with my other bracelets.
4.0,This was also a gift and from all indications the recipient loved it so far so good.
4.0,"I like the dress, it is lighter in color than in the photo. The image also gets very faded out on us bigger chested girls but it didn't seem to get see thru."
4.0,A little low on the top than I would like. Good summer dress!
4.0,I like it but it is not a high waist dress for me. A low waist one instead. Returned it.
4.0,I'm 5'7&#34; around 125 usually wear a 6.  After much research I decided to get the medium (8-10) and glad I did as the small (4-6) would've been a little snug.
4.0,Fits a little weird but still a cute shirt regardless
4.0,"I have used other brands of sleeves before which were 'sized'. I was a little concerned about buying something 'unisex' - it generally doesn't go well - these are a pleasant surprise. They fit well (5'3&#34; , medium) , comfortable to wear and handled 90 degree partly cloudy conditions very well. No sense of getting overheated. I purchased these in white, kind of wishing there was a'natural' option. Word these golfing, had to get out of sand traps, and they got dirty. Laundered them in cool/cold in a delicate bag, but still some stain on them. Will see how they feel in full summer and FL humidity.....nice to know that I can dampen them if they get too hot."
4.0,I may have put it on wrong but it makes my girls look like a couple of Pancakes
4.0,"Really like. Just enough when cold in Sothern CA. Slip resistant saves me on wood and tile. Colors are really cute, blue is my favorite."
4.0,Very pretty. Soft material. The only issue I had was the bottom band was a little more tight fitting than I typically like but other than that it fits great!
4.0,Loved it. I can dress it up or down and it doesn't turn
4.0,The design didn‚Äôt really match the dress so I took a point off but It still fit good!
4.0,This is a really pretty bracelet but it is SMALL!  I have very small wrists and still had to bend it way open to get it to fit onto my arm.  Otherwise happy with it.
4.0,"This is my second pair of Brooks. Not as comfortable as the first pair, but great feel on the feet right from the start."
4.0,"I would recommend but I give it 4 stars because colored ar nothing like shown in the picture, their ok but not as bright."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter who has some parties coming up... it is WAY too big on her.  I assumed that I requested a size large in error but nope it is her correct size.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a pretty dress.  Simple in its lines dressed up by the sequins."
4.0,I really enjoy these cute hoops. I have one in my septum and one in my upper cartilage piercing in my ear. They are a bit difficult to close buy my friend is always able to close them for me!
4.0,"I ordered these sunglasses accidentally thinking they would fit over my prescription glasses. They are so cute and nicely made, but I had to return them. I don‚Äôt understand why I put in a search on Amazon for ‚Äúfit over‚Äù sunglasses and these pop up in the search."
4.0,"I look like a big dork in this costume, but that was the whole idea."
4.0,Fits perfect!! The letters are really close together and doesn't look like what it actually says some times.
4.0,"Better quality than expected!! I am about 5'4&#34; and 155 pounds, and I purchased a L. It was a tad loose around my waist, but I find that as an issue with most of my clothes. I can easily sew it a bit."
4.0,Runs very small order 2 sizes up
4.0,Just a little too big but most likely it will shrink when I wash it so that's a good thing and I wish it was just a little bit more stiffer and not so much like a blanket... But I do love it and it's super comfy and super cute still
4.0,"I ordered a small in this dress and it fit nicely. My weight is 130 lbs and size is 35-28-38. Height is 5""9. Falls over the knees. Good length."
4.0,its  kind of  silky feeling
4.0,"I've owned two of these (I lost the first one).  I like the watch, it's stylish and waterproof.  My only complaint is that the 'leather' (it's not really) band falls apart fairly easily.  Also, it's hard to read the time at night, the backlight doesnt work very well."
4.0,Cute variety of bracelets. Easy to put on and tighten. I cut the ends off some and made new knots so they didn‚Äôt have such long ends. Fun for kids and adults.
4.0,I wish it were overall quite a bit sturdier but otherwise pretty.
4.0,"like this bag, the colors were bright and nice. great for lots of storage!"
4.0,"I bought three because I thought it might break and I need it for a costume. They all came quickly, and looked cute. Now my daughter and her friends use them as an accessory for ice skating costumes. :) I feel that I got my money's worth on this purchase."
4.0,This is a very comfortable top. It is a long length so you can wear it with leggings. It‚Äôs nice quaintly material except for the pocket. The pocket is very YELLOW GOLD and THIN. I think it‚Äôs true to size. I normally wear a medium / large. I purchased the large just in case. It fit cozy but if you want a more fitted look get the smaller size if you‚Äôre between sizes like me.
4.0,Looks great for the price big ring with the secret Engravings on the inside which was very cool I ordered this one and the same one with the silver Square and Compasses I usually wear a size 10 so I ordered it at 10 and it was a tad snug
4.0,"I am 5'10&#34; with decent sized calves. I wear size 9 shoe and the smalls Women (8-10) fit me snug and perfectly, right up to the knee.<br /><br />When purchasing these socks, I was looking for a high quality compression sock to help revitalize my legs post-run. I was very very sore and had to take a bit of time off between runs. I looked for supplemental relief other than medication and ice and came across compression socks. I wanted a knee high medium compression for relief on my calves mainly.<br /><br />I'm a woman, so naturally the pink color enticed me. They do not mention (that I saw) that the socks have butterflies cascading down the inner leg part. This is why I gave the product 4 stars, that aspect did not appeal to me in my early 20s, maybe if I was in my teens still, but this product isn't geared towards teens.<br /><br />When wearing the socks for a few hours a day for three or four days, I noticed a sharp pain in my foot that I've never had previously. I stopped wearing the socks and it was fine after that. I don't know what caused the pain and if it was indeed the socks, but I figured I'd throw that in there. Probably something to do with blood flow.<br /><br />Also, I have very poor circulation to my lower leg area and get very cold feet. After wearing these socks I feel very toasty and have a lot more energy day to day than I did not wearing them and not changing my routine. They helped with the fatigue in my legs post-workout too.<br /><br />Overall a great product and something I look forward to using each day."
4.0,Works great.  The only thing is that it would be nice if the thin part of the light that wraps around to attach it to the collar was a little bit stronger.
4.0,I really liked it but it only took a week for me to break the glass.<br />Can you send me a new one?
4.0,"Good gloves, stitching on thumb came loose soon after use, though."
4.0,"I love everything about this bag except the strap: I am unable to shorten it to a length that works for me (5'2""). Adjusting to the shortest possible length, the purse still rides well below my hips. I prefer the top of a cross body bag to be around waist height in order to be able to reach into the bag easily.<br /><br />Other than this, the bag is delightful. I love the colors, the soft leather, and especially the unexpected depth of the pockets. For a tall person, this bag will be perfect, but because of the strap length, I rate it 4* (I like it)."
4.0,"Four stars because I haven't used them for nursing yet. Not sure how it will hold up after many nights of nursing, but what nursing bra is made to last forever? After work I can't wait to get home and get out of my underwire. I'm 30 weeks and ready for something comfortable yet supportive. This is it!! Stretchy soft and actually creates a bit of lift for us full figured gals. I'm a 42D and bought a size up because I read that they run small. Good idea it fits perfectly. Also have a larger size for those engorged days when your milk first comes in. Be patient with your order as it is coming from overseas. So worth it thus far that I'm going to order two more!"
4.0,"Ordered one black and one brown the black one thin nice fabric! I am 5.6 with 185 lb, large was good for me. The brown never arrived."
4.0,"I wear a 36 B-C bra and found the top to be loose in the breast area.  Other than that, the medium worked just fine for me.  Washing may be an issue, I've washed by hand and in the wash was directed, but found the white stripes to look dingy.  Other than that, I like this dress and get compliments every time I wear it."
4.0,"My granddaughter loves this.  It is made very well.  But be ware, it had a horrible smell in the package but it did wash out."
4.0,"Fit a little tight in my arms, but ok"
4.0,"Nice scarf. Inexpensive for the size and quality. Great color, light but sturdy fabric, generous size. Quite versatile and attractive"
4.0,I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift and he likes them. They can be worn with casual or dress attire.
4.0,"a little wide for my narrow feet.  But that is my problem, not the shoes. Beautiful."
4.0,This dress looks so cute and feminine with a neutral belt on.  O love the colors.
4.0,"Loved the slit, the fit and the price.  Didn't love the fabric, which is super thin and seemed to wrinkle.  Was looking for a travel dress with a little more weight to the fabric.  I tried a large, which fit me great, although I'm usually a Medium 5'3,124 lbs."
4.0,"I ordered the Gold Triangles with all white stones. The bracelet is super shiny and catches all the light to make it sparkle. Plus, it lays well on my wrist. Even the latch is pretty with its own white sparkly stone although I did have a little difficulty unlatching and latching. I'm hoping the latch will loosen a bit after I wear it a while. All-in-all it looks great when wearing it even if you are dressed-up or dressed-down."
4.0,I bought these because of the cleaning service I have. I needed shoes that I could run around in plus that could get wet. Serves its purpose.
4.0,"I like the weight. I wear them loose so, support would most likely improve with tighter strings. It's a great comfortable shoe. I took with me to AZ for the long weekend. Brought another pair of shoes just in case. And didn't wear them. These are my new favorite. Might get another pair just to have."
4.0,Fluffy soft pretty was not as fluffy as the green one I got but still awesome
4.0,"Daughter loved this as a gift, the time turner parts move. Overall she was very happy with it."
4.0,"The pleats are a little odd, almost as though they weren't creased properly. But I think I can iron them to be creased fully."
4.0,Looks great with my corset. Alone it would be a little thin but in the summer the lighter fabric was welcome. I love the shape but it's not made super well or anything.
4.0,"Love this shirt. Little thin, but fits great."
4.0,Fits well. Enough holes
4.0,My grandson looks adorable in his glasses.  They fit his face perfectly.
4.0,"After 20 uses, still very good seal but gets a bit foggy; very comfortable on face"
4.0,Great piece--cheaply done but it is cheap but gives a great look and pops out when wearing all black
4.0,made christmas gifts for my coworkers and they loved them.
4.0,"This necklace is cute and looks expensive, but the heart does flip upside down no matter what I do"
4.0,Ordered large but it shrank when I washed it. It kinda sheds a little but I love it. Definitely maroon :)
4.0,"It's nice, but a bit smaller than what i expected"
4.0,This is huge!!! I am  medium so I ordered a medium and I could honestly wear it as a dress. Order this 2 sizes smaller or any size smaller than what you would usually wear.
4.0,"I am 5'3, 120lbs, and ordered a small. It fit in the waist but was several inches too long. I loved the pattern, though!"
4.0,very cute but the internal shorts kept pulling the waist in awkward ways. fits much better after being cut off. also the inside of the skirt is bright white instead of the same pattern so looks like a halloween costume.
4.0,"A little snug, I recomend to buy the next size"
4.0,Beautiful dress. Soft material and comfy to wear.
4.0,A bit long but a nice strap.
4.0,"Cleats are good, 1/2 larger (I use 10.5 and purchase 11.5 after reading the reviews)<br />I'm just wearing double socks"
4.0,I'm using this as a swimsuit cover up and it works well! Fit is a little small .
4.0,Beautiful shirt but runs big.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, sheer but great for beach cover up or backyard party. Runs big."
4.0,"I am a jewelry snob, I admit it.  I know good taste in fashion and what is and isn't in good taste with jewelry.  This bracelet doesn't disappoint. . . .I am pleased to have it in my collection.  The crystals are brilliant in color and together make a show piece.  Personally I wouldn't wear to work or shopping, as it sparkles too much and would be inappropriate when you blind someone in a meeting or get mugged in the parking lot.  It's perfect for evening wear or special occasions when you want a special sparkle added to your attire."
4.0,"I've only had this watch for about a week, but I like it a lot. It's stylish and keeps good time. One surprising element is the power reserve indicator and the need to wind the watch if the power reserve gets too low. At first it seemed to me that that made this a semi-automatic rather than an automatic watch, but it appears that, if you wear it every day, the power probably hardly ever gets down to the point where winding is necessary."
4.0,Great fit (I‚Äôm very tall so I often have trouble with sleeve length) and comfortable. Good for layering.
4.0,"Not sure what size the model is wearing, but the arms of my cream sweater aren't that bulky at the wrists.  (I do like that look though).  I bought a size SMALL----I'm a 34C and usually wear small----and it fits perfectly.  I would definitely wear a cami or tank top underneath because it is a bit see-thru......not really bad, but you can definitely see a bra.  And the cami/tank top would add a layer of warmth too because the knit is a bit porous.  Over all, it's super cute, I like it and recommend it.<br /><br />P.S.  I did purchase the ""orange"" colored sweater, as well.  I really liked the coppery rust color that it appears to be in the photo.  However, it is ORANGE and I mean orange.  Like the fruit.  Not docking the star rating for this because I returned it with no problem.  And because I should have gone off the color stated and not the color it looked like."
4.0,Cute dress- runs larger than expected. Great quality fabric.
4.0,"Bought as a gift, looks like a durable item"
4.0,"I love the look of this shoe. The material itself, however, is EXTREMELY stiff. This will take a few wears before it becomes comfortable to wear all day. I've worn them twice to work for about 10 hours each time (with plenty of sit down time at my desk) and although they weren't unbearable, I was ready to take them off by the time I got home. I generally wear a size 9.5 (just a tad wide) and I ordered a 9.5 and they fit great. One star off for the stiffness, but it is made of cork."
4.0,LOVE this tank and tell others to buy!
4.0,Love it. Very pretty band for my Flex2. Exactly as shown. Lots of holes to accommodate different wrist sizes. The only drawback is that I have to use the guitar pick to open it. Unlikely that I won‚Äôt lose that soon.
4.0,Great item.Have worn it twice and it seems like it's getting pilled a little....
4.0,It is nice and soft and washes up nice
4.0,These are a little heavier than I would like. Especially on the back of my neck during summer. They are well made and will be perfect when cooler weather gets here
4.0,"Very nice, well made skirt.  The material is substantial.  However, it is not a true red.  It is orange."
4.0,The pants fit perfectly!
4.0,"Nice, light"
4.0,"Sleek design. Looks more expensive than it is, super nice, good packaging."
4.0,"A bit smaller than expected. A US mens small on me is passable but a bit tight, a medium has a bit more slack to it normally. I bought a medium of this and it's sized more like a small. It looks very nice though, you may just want to buy a size larger than usual."
4.0,Just the right size- really looks like a bunch of grapes!
4.0,I love the masks get so many compliments  but they are not individually wrapped which is fine but it claims they are. I will get them again!
4.0,Beautiful. Very colorful. See my previous review on this item from older order
4.0,Nice novelty item.
4.0,My son really likes the designs with the first responder vehicles.  The waist bands fit as expected.  The leg holes are a big on my tall and slender son which causes an occasional peep show when he runs around in his underwear.  (They would probably fit other builds much better.) The colors have held up well to numerous washings.  (Owned for one to two months.). The material feels okay and is of a decent thickness.
4.0,"This is really nice and the fabric is wonderful! It is well made but runs small. I normally wear a medium in US sizes but an xlarge was a tad small. That is the largest size. If I lose weight, I will come back and buy one in every color!"
4.0,Great suit for the cost! I bought one size down to assure I had a form fit. This was flattering and the fabric was thick enough to hide some lumps and bumps.  The removable straps were challenging to get to stay on initially. With a little patience I was able to get them to stay.
4.0,too baggy<br />didnt like the fabric feel
4.0,"USUALLY WEAR A SIZE 6 1/2 - BUT FIND ALL SHOES NO MATTER WHAT ANYMORE, YOU TAKE A CHANCE WHEN ORDERING ONLINE.<br />SINCE ALL SHOES ARE NOW MANUFACTURED IN OTHER COUNTRIES, I BELIEVE AMERICAN COMPANIES NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE USING OUR SIZING"
4.0,Wear every day.
4.0,"I can't stand to wear bras with straps that fall off my shoulders and backs that squeeze me to pieces. This give me freedom as if I have nothing on, yet I'm covered. Takes a little practice to get right, but is great."
4.0,"Great value for the money, still shrinked a little. I did wash it in hot water; I always do though, and toss it in the dryer(hey, I like it clean). It's thin and light, only thing I hate about it is that people get better grips since it's so thin and light. Would but it again, breathes better than my Hawk gi, and feels better also."
4.0,Its a nice bathing suit. I just have a long torso and it fit kinda small
4.0,Nice looking wallet
4.0,Short rod
4.0,Comfortable pants that are light and airy.
4.0,Love the shirt fits perfect. I will be ordering another. Would've gotten five stars but they deliver through UDS and that is the worst possible company to get anything shipped from. They are horrible-United Delivery Service is the absolute worst. But I do like the shirt a lot. Great for work!
4.0,"Good quality, looks sheque."
4.0,Inside of brim is very large more for a large man's head - I was able to take it in and it looks okay but not great - nice looking hat otherwise
4.0,"Great beanie, keeps my ears warm when running outdoors. I can still hear my surroundings which is good. Only issue I've had is if I put my phone in the pocket of my pants to the opposite side of the power button, it will cut in and out. Otherwise wonderful beanie and headphones."
4.0,After the baby I was depressed coz nothing would fit me. The big shirts would only make me feel fatter . This is so cute fits perfect im 5'1 and 125 lbs .
4.0,Nice big bag with lots of room. Can get a little heavy and doesn't sit upright on its own when set on the floor. Lots of pouches and pockets for all the essentials. The insulated and diaper wipe side compartments are especially useful.
4.0,Wore this everyday for a year until the metal clasp came away from the purse. Couldn‚Äôt use it after that so 4 stars but one of my favorites
4.0,I liked the bands and they work just fine. The only thing is that I have had two break after only a few months use.
4.0,I wee bit smaller than expected
4.0,"Very nice quality but, too tight around the calf."
4.0,"The top fit better than the bottom!  It‚Äôs a cheeky bottom but saggy for me because the fit it is too large, go down a size unless you have a larger butt!"
4.0,Good for the price. Runs small FYI
4.0,"If you are curvy with your breast thighs hips or butt size up! Got a medium but slightly to small for my liking, ordered a large. Other than that perfect and comfortable material."
4.0,I usually wear a 12 or large in dresses but I ordered an X it fits real dainty!!!
4.0,"We don‚Äôt have real winter here in Houston, but we do have some chilly days and nights where one needs more than a wind breaker And less than a winter coat.  This jacket is great for that.<br /><br />I took a star off because the pockets are small and weakly lined so can‚Äôt hold much more than a pair of gloves."
4.0,"The dress is a little big, but that is my fault for not ordering the correct size."
4.0,"Firm, does not stretch.  So good for clasping shawl or jacket in front.  Not as good for forming shirt in back"
4.0,"FYI: This is STRETCH TO FIT, even though I had read and reread the reviews before I purchased no one had mentioned it.  I was also not able to tell by viewing the picture of the product so I took a chance (My nephew loves them, he works retail).  If you have arthritis and hope to ease the ache of winter chill, these would work great.  Unless, the pressure of stretch to fit gloves over swollen joints make the ache worse.  Only you know our individual  arthritis.  Good luck!<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because something as specific as stretch to fit shouldn't be fully held against them.  Would be great if they updated the product with this info though."
4.0,Nice color.l and material
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, rich color! The scarf has a delicate weave that makes the material light with a nice drape. If you are looking for a scarf to keep you warm in winter, this might be too light, but it will give some warmth to your neck. It would look great with a casual outfit, but could be used with something dressier. It is, at $24, priced too high, in my opinion. If you don't mind paying that much, however, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"Fits great, wish it were a little longer but it works"
4.0,The item was good quality and arrived quickly.  I am happy with the purchase.
4.0,I LOVE this cover up! The design and colors are beautiful and it looks exactly like the picture. It fits perfectly as well. My only criticism would be I wish it had a way to tie it closed in the front if you wanted to.  I'm going on vacation and will be wearing coverups mostly during my time there.  If it had a tie waist I could wear this to breakfast without feeling like I have to wear something underneath it before going out to the beach. That's no big deal though. I am extremely happy with my purchase and affordable price.
4.0,I like the belt.  I was able to adjust it to my waist and I'n sure I will get a lot of use from it.
4.0,It was a Christmas present from my husband and replaces sandwich bag I have used for years.
4.0,GIFT FOR MY WIFE SHE LIKES THEM
4.0,"Surprisingly amazing fit. It will definitely keep you warm. I like the fact that you can separate the pieces. The only con is that it‚Äôs ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô and makes noise. Other than that, the coat is overall a good pick. I‚Äôd definitely recommend buying this - it‚Äôs an excellent three season coat."
4.0,"Usually I wear a small, but I should have gotten a medium. It was a little tight. I like it though. The buttons on the other hand are terrible. Very ugly."
4.0,"This wallet is exactly as shown. The stitching, leather, lining and packaging quality is premium and I'm happy with it. It is certainly gift-able. I have been using this style wallet for years. I love the low bulk design that is slim enough to remove from my purse and carry in a pocket when I don't want to carry my purse around. I just fold cash in the middle and use the slots for cards/ ID. However, the matte black with white stitching is a distinctly masculine look and is not appealing to me as a woman so I find the ""unisex"" description is a little misleading. I would love to see one a little smaller and with smooth semi-gloss black and black stitching."
4.0,"When I first got these I was in shock to see that they fit really well and material is really good to üòå there a little long at the bottom but some sewing can do the trick. I ordered a medium, which they are true to size. I‚Äôm 4,11 tall and wiegh 128 lbs"
4.0,"The price can't be beat! The neck is pretty high but not uncomfortable with the rib trim. Fits loose-dolman like sleeves-very comfortable but at 5'7"" this is a tunic, not a dress on me."
4.0,I liked the shell but the color on the edges started to flake off within a couple weeks
4.0,"When you compare this to Sperry Topsider or Ughs, they are excellent for the price."
4.0,"Gave as a Christmas gift and my daughter loves it. She said she wish it wasn't so heavy, she would wear it almost every day. She was pleased."
4.0,Actually  pretty comfortable for a costume. The leggings were too large so I didn‚Äôt wear them and cut the bottom ‚Äòporcelain‚Äô sleeve portion off jacket.
4.0,My wife says it is comfortable.  I tried to use the other one and I cannot get it over my hand.  It would fit my wrist though.  I would recommend users measure their hand to make sure it can fit (8.7‚Äù or less).
4.0,"Super cute!  There's a crease from being folded flat in the package, but other than that, it's great."
4.0,Smaller than expected but came individually wrapped and in a beautiful box!
4.0,"These were better quality than expected.  I wear a US Men's size 9 shoe, and they are a nearly perfect fit."
4.0,"Pretty inexpensive so I was overall happy with it. It's really stiff and feels inexpensive, but the look is cute."
4.0,Great quality and fast shipping however the dress was too short on me. Have to wear a slip or leggings underneath. I returned and the process was easy and hassle free. Thanks
4.0,"I got this for casual wear, thinking that it would be a regular tee. It‚Äôs, actually, softer than regular tees. It fits as expected, but cool graphic."
4.0,"They did warn me, so I should have listened. Aside from that - not overly impressed by the material. It has a bit of a flimsy feel to it."
4.0,"For the money, this is a great watch band.<br /><br />The color: It's true to the pictures. The color of the band will start to fade a little as time goes by. I'm about 4 months into wearing this watch daily and the band color is beginning to fade lightly.<br /><br />The wear: It is very forgiving. It can be flexed and stretched while maintaining its form. You can tuck the extra band length into the holder and after a few minutes, it will return to its original shape. It doesn't have the rigidness of many leather bands - it is far more comfortable when wearing for long periods at a time.<br /><br />Really at $15, this is a perfect watch band. My only beef - the color will wear over time. I've found that scuffs and where the leather rubs will fad the color of the band."
4.0,"The golf course where I work has complimentary push carts for the use of players, but the carts lack an umbrella holder. I thought this item would be useful to have in my caddie locker, in case I was doing a group caddie gig on a rainy day...just a way to deliver excellent service!<br />This particular model works pretty well, and is a good value. Here's my list of Pro's and Con's:<br />PRO:<br />1. The holder tube is wide enough in diameter to fit a wide array of golf umbrella handles.<br />2. The clamp mechanism is fairly easy to attach, and doesn't damage the cart handle when tightened enough to securely keep the umbrella upright.<br />3. Wing nuts are a good choice, so no tools are required.<br />4. The angle-adjustment mechanism is reasonably sturdy, though I haven't employed the umbrella holder is a strong wind. (It's generally not a great idea to attach a golf umbrella to a push cart in high winds, especially a lightweight trolley!)<br />5. I tried this holder out on a folding camp chair, attaching it to an arm, and it worked really well! Perfect for when you're required to sit out in the rain or hot sun watching your kid's soccer game, etc.<br />CON:<br />1. The metal screw used to hold the umbrella handle in the tube can damage the rubber handle of most better quality golf umbrellas. I discovered this issue when trying out several different umbrellas in the holder; the screw left a good-size hole in a softer rubber grip.<br />2. You'll definitely want to install both a metal washer and a lock-washer between the wing nuts and the lower clamp, as the wing nuts tended to loosen after use on bumpy terrain.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you usually use a golf course's rental pushcarts, or even if you normally carry your bag, but want a mobile, hands-free rain shelter, this is well worth having in your golf bag!"
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter to go along with the satin one of the same style, and she loves it. It fits her comfortably (size S, she is under 5' and under 100 lbs) , a little oversized but not excessively so. It breathes and she says the fabric is soft, and it washed well. Really nice pajama shirt that will be good for air conditioned summers here. Be sure to wash this and the satin ones before wearing.. there was a little dye transfer from the satin one (plum color) until it was washed. None from the tie dye, but better safe than sorry."
4.0,"very pretty, light weight bracelet."
4.0,"I wear an XL usually, I ordered an XL and it fits great. Very comfortable and hood is functional if you need to put it up. The only problem is that the pockets have trouble staying inside the shirt. Part of them come untucked and stick out a bit. Other than always having to check and make sure they're tucked in, I love it."
4.0,"Im normally a M/L depending on the style. I don't think the top is loose, I just think the material is so slick it slides down easily. Just a little long- I'm a 29 inseam. Great look, not too easily see through."
4.0,"The socks are great - comfortable and they don‚Äôt fall off like other low rise socks do. 4 colors and although a little pricey, I think worth the $$. Would be totally perfect except the white socks, or should I say sock, was only one instead of a pair. Oh well."
4.0,I‚Äôm happy with these shoes. Bought two pairs. My only issue is that one was a bit loose across while the other was a bit snug.
4.0,"color was a little off, but not much, if you cary alot of cards the slots are pretty tight, hopefully they will streatch a little so I doin't fight to get a card out."
4.0,"It is a comfortable sweatshirt, but there is a looooot of pilling after just a few washes."
4.0,Was small fitting
4.0,I don‚Äôt like the color of the dress will return
4.0,"cute, and held up pretty well"
4.0,Used for a teen Halloween costume
4.0,"I expected a stiffer material, but its actually stretchy so choosing small was a great idea.  I may do a little adjustment to decrease the waist band. Otherwise its a lovely dress and color. Will need some ironing to get that smooth look"
4.0,"I bought a couple different colors of these glasses. The colors are great but the red can't really be used while driving because you can't see the green lights at intersections, I had a red pair a while ago but they broke and the red lenses now are darker so that was kind of disappointing. also within a month the arm is loose, I tried tightening the screw but it doesn‚Äôt help. I can't find a way to return them for replacement so that's pretty disappointing as well.  otherwise the shape and colors are great, that's what I really like about them."
4.0,"Cute, comfy, very flattering cut, true to color, I wear it to day-time events and to work. Just note that the lace waist doesn't wrap all the way around (it's only in the front and stops at the sides), has a fabric backing (so the lace is not open/transparent), and the very edges of the lace aren't stitched down so you might have to iron or flatten them otherwise once in a while after washing."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Very very low cut. If you have a small chest or dont live ckeavage this dress is not for you.
4.0,Arms fit snug but great material.
4.0,It's true to size. I shoud have went up a size due to my bust size. Quality awesome & color is great. I ordered a medium blue set. Didn't save the return package so this will have to be a give away
4.0,Could not use because the Hawaiian skirt I ordered came and was plastic and cheap.
4.0,"Super cute dress. Arrives quickly and fits nicely. The only thing is it is shear, so you will need a body suit underneath. This cannot be worn alone, unless you want to show off everything underneath. :)"
4.0,I love the style of these nursing tops (I own 3). The only downfall is they start balling up after the first wash.
4.0,Its a super cute outfit but I am having to exchange it as it runs a size smaller than the description.
4.0,"Watch does what it needs to do. Only complaint is that is is difficult to see the display at really any angle. Almost have to view it straight on to see clearly,"
4.0,Beautiful green color. Love the fit. Would like it better if the print was on the back also. Still very pretty.
4.0,Good product... felt like it was a little bigger than a 20g ... maybe an 18? It was a good push to get it in.
4.0,"Grandson is a Micky fan, these jammies are more on the thin side but he gets hot sometimes, warm enough a little wear on the feet when worn day and night!"
4.0,"These don't pinch, bind, chafe, rub, squeeze - they're SO comfortable!  And a hit - lots of compliments.  I may get another in a different color!"
4.0,It's small and dainty but the chain broke the second time weaing it. Thankfully I was sitting down and  noticed it going south. If it had broken and me not realized it I would've been quite upset. The loop is big enough for a larger more sturdy chain. I woukd highly recommend doing this.
4.0,"Nive dress, good quality for the price but kind of big. Did not liked the way it fitted me so I'm planning on returning it"
4.0,Exactly what I order and keeps you warm.
4.0,"Comfie, wqistband a bit narrow."
4.0,"Wasn't a perfect fit to the watch face, but tweaked it just enough to be workable.  Comfortable, good price."
4.0,"Great quality jacket but a lil tight, will order another size."
4.0,Nice boot and just what I expected but they run big.  I returned them and ordered a half size smaller and they were fine.
4.0,My son loves this hat.  We actually didn't want the &#34;Z&#34; on it so I was super happy when I found out it was just a sticker that easily comes off.
4.0,A fun addition to my cat costume
4.0,Cute and perfect for work. They heel was a little higher than I expected but a good shoe.
4.0,Order at least 2 sizes up. My barely 5 year old wears a 5/6 usually and needed the 10 in these. But he loves them!
4.0,"Received on time. Super cute no defects. Got this for my daughter for christmas. Went with a bigger size and it'll fit her perfect now. So sizing might be off just a little, but a good buy in my opinion. She's going to love it"
4.0,Thought size 12 wide would fit wider than a regular shoe but maybe a little breaking in will help. Other than that love the timberland shoes been buy them for years.
4.0,My clients love it!! I love it
4.0,The chain is shorter than I would have liked it to be. Other than that it is a good quality for the price.
4.0,"These socks were $13.99 at the time of my purchase. I was thrilled to see that they turned out so well (black sock, VA for Lovers woven into sock is high-quality and very clear). They will make a great gift for my friend. I wish they weren‚Äôt so pricey."
4.0,"These three tanks tops are a great deal for the price! I love the texture and feel of them. The medium size fit me well, these do run slightly big as I typically wear a large in T-Shirts and tank tops. For your reference, I am 5-10 ~170lbs.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it would be that the cut at the front of the tank hangs pretty low, as in deep down your chest. This is more of a style thing, but I would have preferred it a little bit higher. Otherwise, great tanks so far. Can't lose at that price"
4.0,"This necklace is so cute, i am in love with it, the only reason it didnt get 5 stars is because of the chain it pulls my hair. But its really cheap and the pendant is worth the money."
4.0,This is absolutely adorable and my baby girl loves it. My only problem is that the bottoms are too big and fall down even with a swim diaper on.
4.0,This little bag is really cute and reasonably priced. I do not think that the materials used to construct this bag are very sturdy so I would encourage buyers to be careful with it.
4.0,It looks good little bit see trough but not that much quality is good but not for winter
4.0,Great for leggings with boots and tunics. Comfy and stretchy.
4.0,"This watch is packed with features. For the ones I want, it's great and they're simple. Stopwatch, timer, multi-alarm. That's all I really care about.<br /><br />Other stuff: compass, altimeter, sunrise-sunset time, thermometer, these don't work. Compass days I'm headed S when I'm going NE. Altimeter is all over the place. Sun times are way off. Didn't know it had a thermometer when I got it, but it's there and usually off by 10+ degrees.<br /><br />I can't speak for the barometer because I don't know how to read it or use it, but j assume that's wrong too.<br /><br />Looks fancy. Great for my workouts. Does the things I care about correctly."
4.0,I like the slippers but they run very small. I always wear and ordered the 7.5 -8.5. By accident i was sent 9-10.5 which fit perfect
4.0,"Cute, not the best quality but you get what you pay for. They fit perfect."
4.0,"This nightshirt is extremely soft and comfortable. I washed it in hot water and dried it on high heat with the rest of my clothes, and it didn't shrink at all...<br /><br />Which was a bummer. The sizing on this runs large, so I would suggest sizing down. I ordered a small, but an extra small would have fit better.<br /><br />Outside of the size being a bit big, I really like this nightshirt. It's soft and cozy and very comfortable to sleep in."
4.0,"not a sock, and not a water shoe.  But perfect for going outside in the mud with so you don't ruin your good shoes. Fits a little large, but stretches to fit a variety of sizes and lasted a long time.  Machine (or water hose) washes well.  Held up great.  To make it fit at first, we just put a pair of socks on underneath it and it fit fine."
4.0,There were no instructions for setting the watch.
4.0,"These are for what they are, and if you need them, here they are. not much to say other than they all metered good upon arrival . . ."
4.0,They are very comfortable.  The pockets are a little weird but other than that no problems.
4.0,The challenge is the bamboo fiber is a little bit 'slick' (like dress socks without spandex) which is bothering me.  The cotton versions I've tried tend to hold the feet better (but those slip off the heel)..  Sigh.  Now... I also like to wear these with jeans and my sandals and for that I LOVE them!
4.0,"I wore it to the game, and it rained the whole game. This kept me dry.  Although it does not breathe, and sweat does condense on the inside. GO Tigers....."
4.0,Fun coat for a night at a party or zipping around a bar during the holidays. The lights make it. Runs a bit small. I‚Äôm consistently able to but off the rack(even European brans) as a 42l. A tend to buy slim fit suits. The size guide said to get a medium. Nope! Had to order a large.
4.0,"Its a wrap. It does not cover the top of your head. I have had one in the past and lost it, this was the replacement. For laying around or napping or wearing under a hat its perfect for keeping your hair wrapped."
4.0,"it's way thin , than it looks in picture. Makes your outfit look a little more dressy. LOVE this belt and is fit perfect."
4.0,"Great shoe, perfect for volleyball on the beach. Don't get the farmers tan on the ankle as much as the higher socks. Only negative would be that sand does get into the socks and needs to be taken off every couple of games to empty. If there was a way to tighten the closer around the ankle that would help prevent sand from getting in!"
4.0,These are really cute but run really small. They are better quality than I expected for $10! I ordered a size 12 and they are probably a size 10 or 11. Bummed.
4.0,"Order arrived just fine. It is a beautiful crystal, although it is not lapis and it is actually sodalite. The crystal did not contain any pyrite and when tested under UV light, it fluoresce with a beautiful orange color. This happened when I was carrying an actual lapis pendent alongside what I purchased. The actual lapis did not glow as expected but this one did. I am satisfied with my purchase, but like, it needs to be renamed to clear up misconceptions."
4.0,I like it but it won't stay closed when decently loaded so it always swings open when I put it down.
4.0,"Love these socks. Comfort is great, they don't get lost in your shoe's. I took off one star for invisibility, the trimmed edges at the top are visible, more so when sitting."
4.0,Nice out door hat to keep the harmful UV ray away.
4.0,"It fits a little tiny bit loose but I just put it on the tightest fitting and it works,"
4.0,I haven't worn this yet but it's adorable. Everything seems to be sturdy and in tact.
4.0,"I bought a large and it just rises way too high. It‚Äôs obvious getting an extra large will not fix the issue. I‚Äôll figure something out to do with it, it was on a super sale and I figured why not?!"
4.0,mui.bonito
4.0,Pretty necklace but it tends to catch on hair and certain clothing.
4.0,"Love them, but the rings come off easily"
4.0,it‚Äôs a little thin but for the price can‚Äôt complain! love how it fits.
4.0,"The medium fits my 55lb Pibble/Chessy well and I like that it is easy to put on and centers the weight over the shoulders. But, the shape of the bag makes it hard to fit things in and one of the zippers messed up right away."
4.0,"Good product. But I wish I had gotten a complete ear stretching kit of 16g to 00g. I'm kind of dissapointed because I didn't receive tapers for 0g, & 00g. The ones that I did receive that had tapers and tunnels were 14g, 12g, 8g, 6g, 4g, & 2g. The only weird thing is that I didn't receive tunnels for 16g only tapers, 10g tunnels only no tapers, 0g, 00g only tunnels but no tapers. I actually had to buy another 10g with tunnels and tapers.üò§ I was currently using the 12g in my 1st piercing and 14g in my 2nd piercing.üòÄ"
4.0,"I have this obsession with open front cardigans, and really needed a black one that fit closer to the skin.  This is absolutely comfortable, fits just right, and flows freely."
4.0,Sizes run a little small. Not as bagging as I wanted
4.0,They look cute but they are extremely heavy on the face and uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time.  They were super cheap and I will use them as emergency sunglasses in the car.
4.0,Stones not set in black as pictured. The post is black but stones set in silver
4.0,The fabric and color are nice. I had to hem them.
4.0,"Can't say I am all that crazy over the red, white and blue pair, but the prism type is great. I love that print. The socks are your standard issue 85% Cotton,15% Polyester blend and they do require hand washing. That will keep them looking bright and new. When you wear them, wear them with pride."
4.0,"Color is great, but it's a bit more blue than the picture (which looks indigo on my monitor).  Super comfortable fabric.  Quality seems good.  I just wish it was slightly more fitted. It's a bit wide in the waist area for my taste. Not as flattering on my figure as I would have liked, but still comfortable and the color works with some trousers and a skirt that I needed a top for, so I will keep it."
4.0,"Great value, fits slightly large but overall it was fine. Good running/racing drifit shirt."
4.0,The reason I like these slingbacks are because its hot and I don't want to sweat in the toes of my heels.  You can't tell I'm wearing them and they are comfortable.  I have not stretched them out yet so they are snug.
4.0,"Nice jacket, but definitely a slim fit."
4.0,"I liked it, but i thought the top was going to be lime green and it is yellow,<br />bottom is not as low as it looks"
4.0,I am going to order more of these. The are so comfortable that I even wear them under dresses.
4.0,I do actually like the bag I at first didn‚Äôt but now after using the big bag I love it ! The strap did break but I was able to make it work I wouldn‚Äôt put heavy items in it it snapped right off. Anyway I still like it
4.0,"loved it, only wish it was a truer purple since I bought it to attend a purple and white anniversary bar-b-que."
4.0,"Comfortable, but fabric started to develop fatigue holes after less than 6 months of wear.  From an overall value perspective, worth the price.  But you get the quality you pay for."
4.0,Surprise gift for a son-in-law -- envied by the rest of the male gathering.
4.0,Super cute toe ring. Very substantial. Nice quality silver. My only gripe is that it hurt to wear w/socks and shoes on. But in flips flops and w/a fresh pedicure...this little toe ring was the perfect fit! :)
4.0,I love the pattern and it looks nice coupled with a cropped jacket. It's definitely worth the price. My only issue is that it's a little shorter than I expected. For reference I am 5'6 and wear a 40DD. I typically wear an XL or 1X in most dresses.
4.0,"Just as described. no scuffs on case, discs work, etc."
4.0,Great apron - great for a guy. Only negative is that the tie straps are too short
4.0,"Good glasses for the price! Little bigger than I'd hoped, but all in all good buy."
4.0,I read a lot of reviews before ordering. It seems to run a little bit big. The material feels really nice. Since I am a B cup I kinda feel like this dress is tailored for larger breast. I'm returning it but it's so pretty I wish it fit me better.
4.0,"The watch is very pretty I'm giveing it to my mother as a mother's day gift I know she'll love it, the only thing about this watch is it came ticking already usually when you buy a brand new watch it has that little plastic that you remove to start the watch, hopefully she won't need a new battery soon, don't know how long it's been telling the time."
4.0,The fabric was good quality and was not transparent. The fit was too large especially in the shoulders. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 125 lbs and ordered a small. Unfortunately I had to return it because it was just too big.
4.0,It runs a little wide so of your child is very skinny expect it to be baggy. It's perfect if your baby has a belly.  Material is thin and shiney
4.0,Surprisingly a very nice necklace! So cute for summer.
4.0,The a perfect Skirt very flattering shows your curves. I will be buying another one just in a different color. It‚Äôs long and sexy perfect üòç and I look damn good in it. Will buy again!
4.0,"Great bag! I had to repair the strap so I took a star off for that, but since then it has held up nicely. It had an unfortunate encounter with some sticky stuff one day and I was able to wash it and hang it to dry. It looked as good as new after that."
4.0,These are exactly what I was looking for - a set of earrings to keep in all the time. My only complaint is I ordered 2 of the same pairs at the same time and one pair is a bit darker than the other. This wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable if I weren‚Äôt wearing all 4 earrings (2 in each ear) at the same time.
4.0,Nice! may be used as unisex.<br />Good quality. Satisfied
4.0,They're great for when you're starting out. These are pretty durable and look really nice.
4.0,These are some good looking cuff links. The aren't the best but they look pretty good and they do the job well.
4.0,Got 4 of them  for my dad. He is 5‚Äô4‚Äù and was 150 pounds and we ordered size large because they run small
4.0,"These are fine jeans. The fabric is very comfortable since it includes just enough stretch to accommodate movement and not so much to be hot. If you‚Äôve not tried jeans with a little stretch, you‚Äôre missing out. To me, jeans are supposed to be rugged first, and comfortable second. I like the material to feel durable. These are a good balance.<br /><br />The stitching and overall construction seem to be good quality. As you can see from the picture, the color reminds me of the 80s (which is back), though they don‚Äôt look old or out of date. The fit is good, though I‚Äôd round up if between sizes."
4.0,great dress - a little snug though on the hip areas ( I am a little on the curvier side though)
4.0,Very comfortable and stylish cap.  The linen is soft and breathes so it's not too hot - even on hot days.
4.0,They're cute but not as shiny as I expected
4.0,"My wife bought these socks for airline travel, when she sits in a seat for hours on end.  She is about 5'5"", and the socks go to the top of her knees.  These socks are 60% nylon, 20% spandex, and 20% polyester.  They should be very durable, but with no cotton, may not be the best for exercise.  My wife says that they're very comfortable.  They had a perfect finish and appear to be well-made.  They did not feel too tight on my wife's legs, but if you have large calves, they might be.  Recommended!"
4.0,Well made for the price.  Convenient to carry. They work better than most reading glasses.
4.0,"Got my product but they are slightly crooked. Overall, I'm happy"
4.0,I ordered L and it fit as expected. The fabric is soft and comfortable to wear around the house however I‚Äôm not a fan of the sticky vinyl print on the Tee.
4.0,for the price its great...........
4.0,"Adorable, fit as expected in the waist but the legs are unreasonably long."
4.0,"Good merchandise, good price, quick delivery."
4.0,Love the range of color!
4.0,"These shorts are great for the gym which is why I purchased these. I love the pocket in the compression shorts underneath. That pocket comes in handy when at the gym to listen to music so I know my phone is on my person and secured. I normally wear a large in men‚Äôs shorts and I purchased an extra large to make sure it was going to fit and assumed it would be stretchy material. When I tried on the extra large, it fit but was a little too tight. I would recommend getting a size or two up. My waist is 36in and an XL fit me."
4.0,"The wallet itself is great! Organizes all my cards, license, and cash all while being very slim.  The only reason for a 4 star review is that it‚Äôs somewhat difficult to get the cards out."
4.0,Really like this dress.  It's comfortable and works for what I needed.  I wear a 10/12 and I'm 5 4&#34; so I ordered a L.  It's a bit shapeless so I will need to wear it with a scarf or good accessories.
4.0,The bottoms fit perfect but the top was a top big
4.0,For what I gave I can't complain.
4.0,Got these for grandgirlies. Wish they had been made in smaller sizes but they are cute and I think they will like the bracelets.
4.0,Nice!! I purchased these for my son and he loved them<br />!
4.0,"I have really big wrist a little over 9"". The description said it would fit sizes around 9"" long. So I just got through and I looked at them and said no way is this going to work. I was wrong which I am glad I was. I'm tires of looking for watch bands. This fits all though I only have 2 holes left until the end of the band but it will be fine. Wish they gave you the option to pick your own 2 colors. Would've liked a red and blue not black and blue that is reason for 4 not 5 stars."
4.0,"This item fit exactly as I expected it would (size XL), and it's comfortable and warm. The fabric/knit is a little bit cheap-ish looking, but not as bad as many others I've bought. It's not going to be my favorite go-to sweater for winter, but it will certainly be worn plenty."
4.0,"I bought these almost 2 years ago.  One of the finger's stitching has come loose and there is a hole, but otherwise, these gloves are still in good shape.  They are warm and feel good."
4.0,"This purse is beautiful, the leather excellent. The straps are the perfect length. It's roomy without being large. It looks like the picture.  I wish it was just a tad smaller however I carry it all<br />The time. If your looking for looks and room this is your product"
4.0,I liked it a lot but after a while the black started to fade
4.0,"The dress is beautiful.  I was worried about dress sizing but it was the right size.  The only reason I don‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because it did bunch up a little bit in the back when I first put it on.  I had this awkward bump in the back.  Luckily, a night of dancing seems to have done away with the bunching"
4.0,This sweatshirt is cute and comfortable. Not traditional ‚Äúsweatshirt material‚Äú but happy with it anyway
4.0,"Super cheap and not well made.  It does however keep time and it only costs $3, so what did you expect.  Makes me look fancy for a fraction of the price! Atta boy China!"
4.0,The review has the wrong questions..  The oil works weel on my leather products..
4.0,"Great lounge outfit. I sized up and should have. Can't remember if I got a L or XL but it was definitely loose. If you want loose and baggy size up, if not order your normal size."
4.0,"Really decent shoes for price. I needed something wide for my special needs daughter who's feet are always cold for when she's not wearing her leg braces.<br /><br />Super comfy, with just enough padding o inside. It has non slick sole which is perfect for her. Has elastic sewn into it around ankle so it doesn't fall off.<br /><br />Decent quality for price.<br />These were under 20$ so anyone complaining honestly confuses me, it's not like you're going to get perfect shoes. But it's comparable to target (although I like these better bc they were slightly wider and more flexible, more comfortable) and way better than something from Walmart."
4.0,"Based on the reviews I ordered a Large. I'm 5'2, 125lbs. 34B. Normally would order a Small. Large fit well. The sleeves are a little short. So if I order the black, I'll order an XL. Color is a military green. Love the look. Not a light jacket. More of a fall/early spring jacket. You will love it, just order up 2 sizes"
4.0,"the fit isn't great on this, but not too bad, seems a little large for me, but still, for the cost, not bad"
4.0,Good quality shirt but runs very small. I ordered L but it's more like a M
4.0,For the price this dress is really nice! I also bought it in black.
4.0,it was excellent
4.0,I'm giving the dress 4 stars only because it wasn't send with the hooks for the neck of the dress. But other than that the dress is wonderful. Very pretty my daughter will be gorgeous at the homecoming dance.
4.0,It's tiny and nice. Suffice enough to keep few dollars and all cards intact.  Good quality.  Loved it. Giving 4 stars because of price variation for different colors.
4.0,So far I think they are cute and sturdy
4.0,I love these socks. Fit is perfect.
4.0,The shoe looks good but smaller than normal size. The material feels more like suede.
4.0,This is a very well made hat.
4.0,So beautiful thanks
4.0,5 year old daughter loves the color blue and flowers so this was a natural choice.  She loved the dress and has worn a couple of times already.  Was a little worried that the dress would fade a bit as it cotton and made in Bangladesh.  Seems as if there was very little fading after two washes.  The fabric is very light.  I do think it's a little on the short side for a dress.  So far my daughter has worn it - her choice - only as a blouse with tights.<br /><br />Overall recommend as long as the price is right.
4.0,"I have a 48&#34; chest and 38&#34; waist, so typically I get my shirts as XL. From reading all the comments on here I ordered a 3XL because they were saying it was about 2 sizes too small. It fit beautifully, if a little loose around my stomach. The fabric was a little scratchy but not entirely uncomfortable. The quality of the shirt itself was actually really good. My one complaint is that the picture shows the laces on the front going down about 1/4 of the way down the shirt and what I got was about 6 inches down with only three holes on each side."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my niece and she liked it but stated it ran small.
4.0,This is really nice. Soft enough not to poke you but holds a heavy pant well. Buckle is thicker than expected although it looks flat when viewed by others.
4.0,"Loved having theses. The only issue I had with the gold necklace was that the chain turned my neck green. Maybe not ALL the gold ones will do this, but just be aware. Other than that, LOVED THESES! (Past tense because I got these years ago, lot them while running to catch a train...literally running...and realized just today a year later that I forgot to write a review."
4.0,"Material is very lightweight and doesn‚Äôt provide a lot of support or lift, but it is very comfortable. Almost forgot I was still wearing it at the end of the day. I am 34E and was surprised the size chart suggested medium, but it did fit well."
4.0,Better than the average grocery bag. Has protection for cold items but not for very long. Good size and easy to fold up at a reasonable cost.
4.0,"The length is a little long for my 5'5&#34; height, but works if I wear wedges with the outfit.  Will order a small with my next purchase because I love this style!"
4.0,Really good shirt. Runs a little small.
4.0,My husband is VERY picky when it comes to pants. He wanted tactical pants that were comfortable but lightweight. These hit every mark.
4.0,"wife loves these, good quality and fit"
4.0,"I will disclose right away that I got a discount for this item if I left a review, but I will be completely honest.  I bought it for my husband to replace one he had lost. He wears a 7.5 wedding ring so I ordered the 8.  He says it is comfortable and is not too tight. The last one he got was a little tight , but doable. Plus, he likes the color (black) and thickness of the band. I think it looks nice and will be great when doing yardwork or other various activities he would normally take his ring off for."
4.0,"Right price, durable enough but the lace system is ineffective. We will finally move on to actual laces after this pair."
4.0,"I have bought all sorts of glasses.  From cheap less than a $1 glasses to $350 Carbon Fiber Aviator Raybans.  I wear these all the time.  I have bought 3 pairs (girlfriend loved them, stole a pair!).  One for my car and one for my house when I get picked up or just dash out quickly.  The quality of these is very good, especially being only $5.  If you lose these then it is no big deal.  I travel every month so that takes off stress of losing glasses.  The smooth matte finish makes these look killer.  I've gotten many many compliments on these.  They fit great and the arms can form to whatever your head shape is (I have a huge head).  They are very sturdy, especially for being $5 glasses.  I wear these more than my CF Raybans.  Highly recommend<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I've now bought a total of 5 pairs of these.  I wore a pair recently when I was building a school in Guatemala and some of the matte started to flake off at the nose and where my ears touch.  I believe the cause of this is a reaction from my sweat and sunscreen (I'm pretty white) with the glasses, I could be wrong though, but I haven't had a flaking issues before.  I ordered another pair as I gave them to one of the kids there.  The spring hinges on the 3 other ones I bought were gone, disappointed.  The arms now bow out a bit.  I flew out a few days after Guatemala to Vegas for a convention with the new ones and accidentally fell on them which they of course broke.  Ordered another pair while in Vegas and got them when I arrived back.  These are still great sunglasses, BUT I am moving it from 5 stars to 4 stars because the spring hinges are gone.  I loved those hinges and now it's meh.  I'll most likely be looking into different sunglasses unless they bring them back."
4.0,"This watch is pretty nice with one exception.  If the company feels that it is necessary to identify the watch hands, the least they could do is provide instructions on how to properly remove band links."
4.0,They looked as expected. Love them!
4.0,Really comfortable. True to size.
4.0,"the only thing i dont like about this dress is it rides when you walk, i would recommend wearing leggings or shorts with it. it is very comfortable though."
4.0,"These are just short of perfect.. unfortunately that means I can never put them in a dryer, even on &#34;knits&#34; cycle. They are very comfortable and they support &#34;extreme movement&#34; no doubt a factor of the tight fit which I found comfortable.  Two in a bag made me feel it was a good deal. These are not exceptional workout clothes for truly hard workouts. But for the average exerciser they are a good buy."
4.0,"These are cute, but if you want them in a hurry, don't hold your breath.  They ship from the manufacturer in China.  And I do mean ""ship""."
4.0,"Great quality for the price. I bought this as a gift for my father. He is a large guy. I ordered him the 4XL and the fit was great, but the neck was a little small. Which I did read other reviews that said the same, but he just cut it a little and it works fine for him. That‚Äôs the only reason I took away one star"
4.0,"this is NOT mustard yellow, it is closer to sunshine yellow"
4.0,"Not as solid as my old closed toe tevas, but comfortable. I'd buy them again."
4.0,This wallet was MUCH larger than I was expecting. The zipper also is a bit finicky so I probably wont be using that pocket much. Otherwise I do like the feel of it and it is pretty cute!
4.0,"I get so many compliments on these shades.  Very nice case and a cloth to clean the lenses.  The glasses did not look that great when I pulled them out of the box.  I thought they looked cheap.  It had a lot to do with the blue chrome reflective lenses.  The doy shield your eyes from the sun and you do look really cute wearing them.  The best look is out in the sun.  If you order these, take them out in the bright sun and take a selfie before you decide to send them back."
4.0,These are usually great; however in each package there seems to be one item that (despite being labeled as the same size) is cut much smaller or larger than the others and doesn‚Äôt fit (probably a quality control issue?). The rest of the items in the pack all fit perfectly and are very comfortable; but there is ALWAYS one in the package that doesn‚Äôt run true to size.
4.0,Links are adjustable however it is not able the be fine adjusted. Fits good but not perfect.
4.0,"Love the look of these earrings.  They are long and look nice when wearing.  Light enough to be very comfortable to wear all day.<br />With the design of these, I will probably only wear them when I'm working, for church, or if we go out for a meal.<br />Earrings would go great with shorts, jeans, or dressed up for an evening out.<br />Happy to have these."
4.0,My son love‚Äôs it. Fits well looks great! Purchased for my son and he loves it. No sunburn here.
4.0,"Good quality gloves for my purpose, which is handling old photographs to scan them. I haven't tried washing any yet."
4.0,Love this necklace. Perfect for the price!
4.0,"I purchased the socks to go with a tuxedo for my 3mo old as I wanted to avoid buying actual shoes that he will only wear once. That said, they fit as expected. Quality also is as expected for the price, they are by no means high quality dress socks but you get what you pay for."
4.0,"You get what you pay for. After one use in the shower, the &#34;Vertico&#34; brand label fell off. I'm not sure how confident I am in the durability of this product, but will come back and edit this if I have any issues."
4.0,"I love these pants, I ordered them after getting a pair of them in black from Gabe's and being so impressed witht the fit. I got them in a large so I would have room to tuck in shirts, they're a little big, but they look good. My one complaint is the seams seem weak right out of the box, I would take special care in washing them. I have black, navy, and khaki."
4.0,"I passed over these a bunch of times because of the reviews on size, but they ended up fitting fine! Only 4 stars because the quality isn‚Äôt great, I‚Äôm guessing these will only last one or two wears."
4.0,"I like the shirt so far, haven't had a chance to wear it, but would buy again."
4.0,This little fleece is adorable. It keeps my daughter warm and so so cute! I only wish it was better at blocking the wind.
4.0,"Cute, but fit weirdly on my body, so I returned it. It was a bit too loose at the waist and too short at the legs for my body type. I'm 5'7&#34; and weigh about 124 lbs and I typically wear a small/medium (4 - 6). Liked the design, but I also didn't have anything that would go really well with the pattern."
4.0,"A little tight at first but loosened up, should put a lanyard on the shackle screw lost it and still looking."
4.0,Very flattering dress but not what I needed for the event I was going to.
4.0,"Would give 5 stars if different plastic tie was used. It doesn't seem like it would last through a trip. Several broke when I tried to bend them. So I purchased new softer ties, because I liked green color and were reasonably priced..  I also wish they had a pink color as well."
4.0,Nice quality and slim as advertised. Overall happy with the wallet. The only reason I give a 4 instead of of 5 is that I've had other wallets like this and prefer the more hard rubber type of band for the cash as it makes it feel more secure.
4.0,My friend Loved it
4.0,"I bought the Navy one.  The colors bled into the white stripe at first washing, so that was kind of a bummer.  Perhaps it'll get a bit whiter as I continue to wear and wash.  The metal zippers at the hand pockets are SHARP...not really comfortable to put your hands in your pocket.  The zipper is metal and is probably inferior to most, so I can see a zipper failure coming in the future.  Overall look is pretty darn good.  Fit was good.  Fabric is light but not see through.  It won't keep you warm but fits my needs in the gym quite well.  I do like the looks of it.  Feel it was worth the purchase."
4.0,Bought two bands for gear sports watch.<br />Both look good and easy to swap.
4.0,I love the shoes and so do my daughter
4.0,Good quality and they look great!
4.0,"This is a great choice for an elderly person. Simple to use, no unnecessary buttons, no buttons that you can accidentally hit to change settings. Loud enough to hear. Self setting time. No fuss, no muss!"
4.0,Small but cute keychain.
4.0,This is a very nice necklace however it is very small. Would be a great gift for a little girl.
4.0,The green looks more yellow in real life than in the photo. That‚Äôs my only complaint.
4.0,Definitely a cute nose ring but one of my stones fell out before I even had it 2-3 weeks.
4.0,"I got a medium and there's still room, I usually wear size 8-10. The ruching on the sides adds style and shape. It'll be perfect with jeggings and booties. For the price, I think it fits the quality."
4.0,"Nice dress, fits well."
4.0,Boxier on my husband and makes him look a little fat but it‚Äôs just for Halloween so not a big deal so I‚Äôd size down!
4.0,Bought as a Christmas gift for older man
4.0,A little big but great to have when legs get super swollen. Compression socks are great for anyone who has Lymphedema really helps a lot. I like the fact these are toe less and are easier to put on.
4.0,Really like this bag. It's large and will hold my lunch bag and large planner with room to spare.  Both the black and pink are definitely more muted and dull in person.  I still like it and would have bought it anyway but I was a little disappointed because it looks so much more vibrant in the image.
4.0,"Although I had to return it because it was too tight across the belly for my preference, I was very impressed by the look and material of the dress. It looks much more expensive than it is! I would have been proud to wear this to the wedding, if it had been a little more flattering."
4.0,"Very nice . The only thing we didn't like was that it was so big, we had to take 2 links out right away. We ordered 7 of them for wedding gifts."
4.0,Love it super comfy and cute
4.0,"Was a lil snug around the upper back when came to zipping it up, but it was great fit overall. Definitely recommend getting a petticoat"
4.0,wonderful product..I am a hair stylist and its held up pretty darn good. I would recommend it to anyone who is  about to propose
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my mom......
4.0,"Belt appears as advertised. Good quality for the price, simple no frills design."
4.0,I like how it looks and has been working well. It looks like it cost much more than it does.
4.0,Wrinkles very easily but lightweight and pretty color
4.0,Fits perfectly very comfortable while working out love the pockets.
4.0,"Top is fine, shorts are a bit small. I am average in top and bottom...<br />Fabric is great"
4.0,Cute top! Fits well and made well
4.0,Very happy with these. I ordered them in silver and black. Smaller than I expected but pleased with them regardless. The screw back may be tricky for some if you are not use to this type of jewelry bit once in place they stay there. I've been wearing th constantly and had no trouble with them coming unscrewed. They are very comfortable.
4.0,"After reading reviews I sized up and got a L as a girl that‚Äôs in between, but these were just too big, like too loose in the waist and would slide down big. Returning so not sure how warm they actually are. But definitely go with your normal size.<br />I also ordered two other pair of fleece lined leggings from 90 Degrees and they were thicker and stretched with ease! I got a M in them and they were perfect."
4.0,"Fits as expected in terms of length and width. But if you have long arms like i do it falls a little short, but this happens with all my jackets. Nice price for the look youre going for."
4.0,"Three close was definitely thicker than expected. It maintained shape week, although it was a little loose."
4.0,Nice watch. Too hard to reset. Worth the price
4.0,"My wife's thoughts on this:<br /><br />It's warm but not too warm.<br />Very comfortable and cute feeling, fits great as well.<br />Perfect for sweater weather."
4.0,Great for soccer and kickball or any sport played on the turf
4.0,I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 105lbs. I went with an XL for length and it works really well especially if you‚Äôre looking to wear heels. The waist band was perfect fit also and I‚Äôm 26‚Äù on the waist. It is made of nice durable fabric and is heavier than I expected ‚Äîwhich is perfect. Only thing is is that it‚Äôs pleated material but it is super flowy
4.0,Comes up high on my waist but they are very soft and comfy!
4.0,It's quite fitted. But adorable. Soft material.
4.0,I love this bathing suit! The top is a bit more revealing than expected but still really cute. I had issues keeping the zipper up which is never good. So if you're busty I would suggest getting the one without a zipper.
4.0,It‚Äôs a thick sweater and I found it to be a bit stiff and not soft like I was hoping for-<br />Form fitting like I wanted- hits my mid hip region like I wanted and looks like image . I got a medium gray and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 160lbs curvy it‚Äôs a great fit I will keep it... just wish it was softer
4.0,"This jumpsuit looks just like the picture. However, in the description it says it has pockets, it does not. It also says the straps are stretchy, they are not. I normally wear a large to XL depending on the item. I ordered the XXL because I wanted to make sure it had the loose fit. Although this fit, it didnt fit as loose as I thought it would, it does run small in the waist area so keep that in mind. It also doesnt have any give what so ever. But the color is bright and pretty and its soft. You could wear this lounging around the house or dress it up for an evening out. I'm 5'6"" and I can wear heels without it looking ridiculous. Its 50% off when I ordered it so for the price just buy it, I wish there were more colors."
4.0,Overall not a bad LBD I‚Äôd buy it again
4.0,"i like this item because its affordable and doesnt look cheep when you wear it , i also bought a saphire string with it"
4.0,Good quality and nice colors
4.0,"Top is pretty loose, actually. It fits well otherwise through the hips and legs."
4.0,Took a long time to receive. Nice bag. Seems well made. I use it every day and so far it's holding up.
4.0,Love the color and the soft material.  I'm 5'6&#34; 128 lbs and it fit as expected.
4.0,It's a pair of fun pants. I like it.
4.0,To small and not long enough
4.0,"The shirt is closer to a maroon color. It is not as bright as the picture but it fits great and the lettering does not crack with washing, but I do air dry to prevent this from happening."
4.0,Super cute but kept flipping over to where the birthstone wasn‚Äôt showing and it just bothered me because my wrists are super small. Still loved it but the flipping kept bothering me
4.0,good luck
4.0,A little tight around my mid section but fit great in the chest. Happy with support and smoothness of fabric. Overall 3 stars
4.0,Cute style. Runs a bit large. White fabric is slightly see-through. Is slightly longer than I like.<br />Shipping was slow.
4.0,"great gift for a fan, well made and nice design"
4.0,"I bought this dress to have my students color at the end of the year as a special memory keepsake. I bought the medium, but could've easily sized down to the small. the fabric and design are adorable and I'll be purchasing another for next year as well!"
4.0,The bottom broke off. Shame I really liked it.
4.0,sizing is much smaller than stated BUT with that being said the product was made and looked very good
4.0,This fit perfectly and looks great!  I received a lot of compliments on the style and color.
4.0,Some had little to no color at all but for the ones that look great are definitely worth the price they are beautiful shimmery sandstone but 2 looked fake great in general though and great for gifts!!
4.0,wife loved it! plan on upgrading the chain though
4.0,"Great material, but was smaller than expected"
4.0,"These work as advertised, very clear, fits over my glasses seamlessly, to include the anti-glare and polarized features.  The only thing I have a issue with is the width of the over the ear support arms. They are a bit wide and thin hence causing some discomfort to the top of my ears when they are worn for extended periods of time."
4.0,I love the earrings<br />The only problem is that the hook is to wide and it hurts my ears I can‚Äôt wear them
4.0,"If you want a light feeling hat, this will work. It's not quite like the other dri fit Nike hats I have."
4.0,"Great fit, very comfortable but a little too long."
4.0,"A good, slightly thinner athletic sock. .i like them"
4.0,"Very fast delivery, Item as described"
4.0,"I ordered these for my daughter, who wears a 5-6. When we received them they were way too big. I wear an 8.5 and they fit me with some extra room in the toes. I decided to keep them for myself and order her a smaller size."
4.0,Very cute dress!! Pretty happy with it.
4.0,I bought my kids these Santa hats and they‚Äôre still in good condition even wash after wash. They have had them over 2 years.
4.0,Nice pair of sunglasses at a reasonable price.
4.0,love this so comfortable and awesome !!
4.0,Good. A little smaller than expected
4.0,"This is my second pair. Love them. A little tight at first,  but they stretch and break in nicely. The crystals are red, but the suede looks more hot pink than red. I viewed these both on my tablet and laptop and they definitely look more red. Keeping them, but just a little disappointed with the color."
4.0,as i will be traveling to Europe in the near future this wallet is just the thing.  have a matching pocketbook in this design and was lucky enough to find the matching wallet.
4.0,"I'm a size 11 shoe and toe to heel, these are spot on, if only a TOUCH small. A size up would be a mistake, but any smaller and I'd waiver.<br /><br />That said, the arch support is exactly what I need for my feet. As I wear them in, I expect the comfort level to increase, but first start is good.<br /><br />They keep my feet warm and I don't expect them to be too warm come summer months, or absorb/cause any smell.<br /><br />The only adjusment necessary was to cut out some tags placed right in the arch of the foot. And given that placement, you have to really get in there to cut them out so as not to chaif at a key spot on the foot."
4.0,I ware medium but ordered x large.
4.0,"I will be ordering more colors. I sized up by reading other reviews and should of just went with my normal size. Very light weight and breathable material. Yes, it maybe a little see thru but it‚Äôs a coverup."
4.0,"Way too tiny, but I like bigger jewelry.  Would have given 5 stars if they'd been larger.  Still, great quality and pretty design"
4.0,"Useful,and convenient,beautiful"
4.0,"A little too thin, ripped rather easily. But cute while they lasted. Lots of compliments."
4.0,I really liked the earrings each came in individual packaging. The only dislike is one of the earrings came chipped off from one side the paint came off and theres a white spot on green color.
4.0,The foot fit as expected but the shaft runs really large to the point of being baggy...but this is the first time I ever found boots too big for my legs!<br /><br />My calves are 21 inches and firm so finding calf boots are a challenge.  Bought these for my birthday and I cannot wait to wear them!
4.0,I like them but a lot smaller than I thought they would be.
4.0,I really like it's size.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the chain is only 18 1/2 inches instead of 25 1/2.  I don't want to clutter it with charms so I padded the back with paper to hold the charms in place.
4.0,This is my second dress of this type. It is lightweight and good for my work and I bought size over so I didn't use any stretch because the material is quite thin.  I will buy more
4.0,"After about 2 weeks of wear the top part fell off the bar.  VERY cute piece, doesn‚Äôt last long. I super glued the decoration back on and it lasted another month before breaking off again."
4.0,"This corset is nice, but is not made for waist training (as one should figure). It is quite pretty, and the boning is flexible enough to allow for breathing room. The ribbon is a bit cheap, but can still hold its own. I am a size 34 waist and ordered a 3X based on other reviews and the sizing chart, but it's a bit too big for me, even laced as tight as it can be. I should have ordered just one or two sizes larger, and could have adjusted them with the ribbon."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 130lbs and a mother of 3. I carry my weight primarily in my hips and thighs. I ordered a small. I think it‚Äôs a cute dress but it makes me look frumpier than I am. I‚Äôm actually proud of my figure, but I don‚Äôt think this fit is helping me. Bought it for nursing access, and it is good for that. Fabric is not transparent, but does wrinkle easily. I washed and dried it hoping it would shrink and form better, but it did not change. I did receive compliments while wearing it."
4.0,Love this bracelet. Thinking about ordering another in another color and a couple for my God-Daughters as well. Great Price
4.0,"Me gust√≥, pero es m√°s peque√±o de lo que cre√≠"
4.0,"I received the geometric shaped aviator style frame glasses. They are flattering and light weight, and the fit is comfortable. And yes, they do cut glare and seem to sharpen focus in bright sunlight. But since I wear prescription glasses, I have to wear these over my regular glasses. While they do fit, I only wear while driving because I think it looks funny to wear stacked glasses! Just a little too light to get 5 stars but definitely worth 4 stars."
4.0,"I love the Amanda tapered jeans - I have seven pairs in various sizes and they are all size6.  I assumed that these boot cut, which I would love to own, would be the same.  Nope.  Tried two of the size6 thinking the first must have been wrong.  I plan on ordering the size8 eventually but the color I want is currently $20 more."
4.0,"As others have mentioned, this isn't the highest quality piece of jewelry out there. The pupils of the eyes are sloppily done, and overall it has a very slapdash feel to it. With that said, I occasionally like that aesthetic, and so this for me was not a drawback. The beads seem to be sturdy and there has thus far not been any chipping or wearing off of any kind.<br /><br />Do be aware that if you have larger wrists, this bracelet may be uncomfortable for you. I have fairly small wrists (about 6.5 inches in diameter) and there is a good bit of room, but wrists bigger than 7.5 inches may find this bracelet too tight. I imagine since the bracelet is of a spring type construction, the wire core could probably be encouraged to bend at a wider angle to accommodate larger wrists, however I have not personally tried to do this."
4.0,"These do keep your glasses from denting your nose, however, they are large and very visible. I wear them when I‚Äôm home and if I wear my glasses outside, I remove them. Easy off and on"
4.0,Strong & included hole puncher tool
4.0,I really like the Color. I have 2 pair of the real Vuarnets and these are compatible for the PRICE.
4.0,"I love the color options, particularly the stone (I searched for a greige!) but the strap is too big for the 38mm watch but not enough to keep me from wearing it."
4.0,Buttons are red not black/grey as shown in product images.
4.0,"Great dress, not see through.  Only thing is it is a little small."
4.0,Quite a large bag. Wish it had more pockets and maybe some form so u can carry it when it's not so full without it looking not so good
4.0,"This dress was purchased for my company holiday party coming up - What a bargain! For the price, I was expecting something much thinner, or cheaper looking.. BOY was I wrong. I love this dress, it has exceeded my expectations and looks great! The ONLY reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the shoulder part of the sleeve is slightly too large, but that may be because I should have purchased a medium (though the rest of the dress fits well) The dress is slightly fitted and goes just above my knees - I am 5' 7&#34; and about 145 lbs."
4.0,easy to put on needs a little more padding for the insoles
4.0,"Literally is exactly as stated in the description... Metal is fair quality, definitely nothing special, but that's why it's so cheap!"
4.0,Item is as advertised
4.0,If you have long earlobes you may have a problem getting them on. They do not fit in my cartilage piercing.
4.0,I'm very pleased with these earrings. They are pretty much as described and as pictured! They are sturdy and they are attractive on. Thank goodness that they instruct you on how to close the clasp because it is somewhat tricky. But I wouldn't let that small thing discourage anyone!
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for...I need to type in more words, so here they are.  Have a good Day"
4.0,A little sheer not sure they will last long but otherwise good
4.0,I really like them but they keep untying by themselves.
4.0,Great deal on a Vera Bradley! Wish the interior pockets were also quilted like in some other options. These are nylon. The bag is wider and would fit more items if only 2‚Äù taller too. Easy to carry and super cute in person!
4.0,"they were for our son, but they turned out to be more purple than blue which is the color we ordered"
4.0,"This is reasonably heavy fabric for this price & will flow nicely in flamenco. Not very thin like one reviewer said the black was, though thin enough that panty lines will be a concern. :} The ruffles are unhemmed. I like the drawstring. The sizing runs a little small so I'm glad I ordered a large--I wear a 10-12 & this fits snugly. It arrived sooner than I expected. Placed order Jan 2--arrived Jan 6. Not bad for practice, which is why I bought it."
4.0,You need to order one size up
4.0,"I loveeee geometric earrings and I really liked the different ones in this set, but a post came off of one of the earrings so be careful with them. Otherwise they are really cute!"
4.0,Great for slim wallet. Can fit about 2 cards in each spot. Right now i have 7 credit cards in the front and my license in the license spot iin the back. Usually carry around 6-8 bills in the magnet strap.<br /><br />Great product for the price and would recommend if trying to go smaller on a wallet. No bulk in my pocket now. Its great
4.0,"cute dress, but it tends to fall off my shoulders. Would be better if it had tie near the neck. I plan on adding one soon."
4.0,"Me encanta la tela, el vestido quedo a mi medida peso 148 libras es taya M!"
4.0,Looked lively on
4.0,"Comfortable enough, but a little tight around the belly for my &#34;apple&#34; shape. I chose to keep it anyways and just tried to stretch it where needed. Its a good quality material and it was a little hard to try to stretch and hold it that way. I recommend buying it. I think its worth trying to work with to fit you right."
4.0,Not a true fit runs small
4.0,Excellent coverage for the face from the sun.
4.0,I knew it would be small since i read the reviews but it literally fits a phone and a very thin wallet. It fit the need though. My daughter had a space themed prom and it was perfect.
4.0,I ordered XL in another style so i assumed i would need that size in this version.  could go large for tighter fit.  Like the tops though.
4.0,"I am 5'-8"" and 125lbs. I normally wear size small or 4 in pants but order a size medium for tights which I did. The biker shorts are high waisted and thigh length. It's very form fitting yet really comfortable. The material is lightweight and breathable so my sweat didn't just pool inside the tights. There are pockets so you can store small items. The only thing is that there are a lot of visible linings/stitching from the cut sections, specifically down the crouch area. I'm not a huge fan of that visually."
4.0,"Good looking over the boot pants, comfortable and well made. Completely dirty after 3 days of riding but cleaned up great and look like new. Only negative is the inside coating on the pants shows a lot of wear after 12hrs riding.  Would buy these again."
4.0,"I will say these leggings are super soft and well made, the problem was size. I chose the smallest size possible and I still swam in them. Too bad, cuz they are nice leggings and people really do think they are the expensive brand! I had to return, but as usual that was easy peazy with Amazon Prime return policy!!"
4.0,I like it very goood
4.0,"This bag is a good bag if you don't carry a lot with you, I rated it 4 stars because it was a lot smaller than I was expecting it to be. It is a really nice quality bag though, the inside is very nice and feels premium as well as the outside. I use it to carry my phone, my wallet occasionally, my earbuds, and a few other essentials. If you like smaller bags then I would recommend this to you."
4.0,For my Mom and she likes it.
4.0,Good size and cute but I noticed some color fading with just one use.
4.0,My daughter got maybe one or two wears out of this hat. I would say size up by one size. It is very cute and we received so many compliments however she couldn‚Äôt wear it long.
4.0,"This is a nice quality sweater and the color is true to the picture.  the seams are nice, no stray threads etc that is often the case on imports.  i would buy it again and just might buy it in another color."
4.0,Fabric is very soft. Nice built in bra for large breasts . I'm a 36 D and it fit great. Thigh area not cut to high.
4.0,"Update: After wearing this for a day or so, I took away a star because the straps were digging into my shoulders a bit. Also, the scoop neck dips down and ends up with lots of cleavage - which is fine, but does affect the versatility of the top. Likely a much better fit for people with smaller and/or lighter boobs than mine!<br /><br />Super soft, nice stretch, and surprisingly flattering. It falls to right about my hips (I'm 5'8"" with a long torso) and floats away from my body in a way that helps cover for a bit of a tummy on bloated days without looking like a tent or a maternity shirt. I find the built-in cups a bit heavy, and the shape of them shows pretty clearly through the top of the tank. But for the price? Not bad! And they hold up my F-cups pretty well -- it's not equal to an actual bra, of course, but keeps 'em comfortable for around-the-house purposes and short errands. I bought it in the pale blue color, and it's not sheer at all, which is nice. I'm already planning to buy this in more colors."
4.0,"These were so so tiny. Much smaller than I had anticipated, but it is likely my fault for not reading the listing for sizing. If you are into stud size earrings, these are for you."
4.0,"Recently got these for my brothers wedding that took place on uneven grass and dirt pathways.  Not only do they keep you from sinking in the grass, they stabilize the heel to keep you from rolling your ankle on flat ground, they also kept me from falling through the cracks on a wooden deck.  I think they look kind of weird, and I'd rather wear wedges, but they definitely got the job done."
4.0,"Loved these chokers! For the price, it's a steal. Only complaint is the gold and dark green ones came pretty crinkly and didn't really flatten out. I haven't really been able to wear them well because of this. The others are really cute, especially the big black and white lace tie ones. It came with 3 light pink ones, so I guess I would have preferred different colors."
4.0,"Very comfortable and attractive looking, however I wish they had a bit more support. Good for light workouts but not so much for running."
4.0,Great t shirt quality but runs very small I think
4.0,I got this bracelet for my friend and she love it sadly it came a little after her birthday but the company was very helpful to sure the bracelet got to my friend and I really appreciate it
4.0,üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
4.0,Cute but little small
4.0,"The bag is well made and a good size, a step down in size from the last Messenger bag I carried. Only real complaint is there isn't padding for a laptop but that's explained in the description of the item so not the seller fault at all."
4.0,"Wore this today and stayed warm despite a strong north wind. It has a left hand zipper, opposite of all my other jackets. I'm a bit concerned about how the zipper will hold up. I wear a M to L in most things, but I followed the sizing chart and ordered an XL. It fits fine."
4.0,Very nice and classy design
4.0,"I think these may be a bit too small for some people, but I prefer a smaller earring. They're perfect for me. The rings are pretty discreet and don't distract from the design, which may be a negative for people who want more of a statement. I like these a lot and will be wearing them often, but they may not be for everyone. The only thing I don't like about them is the clear plastic backing, I prefer a metal one."
4.0,I used them as a gift üéÅ<br />What they are used for I would guess as socks...
4.0,"I was surprised to receive as many compliments and comments as I did but the patterns are so unique that it is hard not to love. The medium was the right size for a size 6. I would recommend that if you are a size 8 that you size up to large and if you are debating between a 4 or 6 that you go ahead and size up to the medium. I wish the waist were a little longer and the belt seemed sized more towards the 8 so it fits but is a little loose (not too loose). Other than that, this is a dress that will be worn!"
4.0,I think it is more of a petite shaped. I wear a medium and bought a medium. It fit well except that it's a little short. I bought the white color. Love the quality and love that it's not transparent.
4.0,"I'm not exactly sure how people are capable of breaking this watch, if you're looking for a watch that's not too over the top but still looks good on your wrist then this watch is probably something you might want to buy. However you might not want to mess around with it too much since it doesn't feel like the strap will save you from a great fall."
4.0,"The color and pattern are darling! The dress is a smidge short to be worn to work without leggings, but it layers really well. The only slight complaint I have is the seams in the front distract a little from the pattern, it would have been cuter if it was a solid panel. Overall, I love it!"
4.0,"For size reference I am 5'0"" and 150lb. I ordered a Large and it was perfect. a little long but that is to always be expected with me being so short. I bought this dress for family pictures and it aas almost perfect!!! It fit well, it hid my insecurities and I got soooo many compliments on it! My only complaint is the belt is way too skinny and moves away from the waist seam if you move much at all and it made a few pictures look awkward which is the only reason Im giving 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Like the colors  surprised it's easy to put on.
4.0,Just what I needed for a party!!
4.0,Very nice and well made but a little smaller than I expected
4.0,Was a gift and haven't heard.  But it was very pretty and felt nice.  Big bag.
4.0,Made a great Christmas present.
4.0,This is a great dress for work or even a casual dinner. The sleeveless style gives it a sexy look or you can throw a cardigan or blazer over. The skirt section is a little thin so it would need to be worn in warmer temperatures.
4.0,Purchased these as a gift and feel very confident on recommending these leg warmers to any future costumer!<br />Some say they thought they felt thin but I think they are perfect.<br />You wouldn't want something too thick and bulky. These will be perfect with a pair of biit
4.0,This was a gift and the recipient loved it!  The picture on the tote looks just like her pet.  The tote is roomy too.  She said she started using it right away.
4.0,"The shirt is great, the fabric is sleek and stretchy. I ordered a size up to be sure this would fit and I am glad I did. This runs a little smaller than normal size. I wear a large and ordered and XL and it fit perfectly. It‚Äôs a great shirt, nice quality and beautiful print!"
4.0,"The belt was fine, the color was fine, the length was fine. My complaint is with how far the buckle sticks out from the actual belt. I wanted more of a flush buckle."
4.0,Pretty but I lost them somehow
4.0,"Fits great. But they changed the fabric. Like someone else mention, the knit of the fabric has changed a lot.  They used to be made with less spandex material which made them look and feel more like dress slacks.  Now, they feel more like leggings.<br /><br />I really like the original pants I bought and was hoping for the same when I reordered.  The original pants felt extremely durable and have stood the test of time.  I don't think the new fabric will be as durable. Time will tell.<br /><br />On a good note, they are very comfy and slimming.  The stretch is perfect and i can tell they won't fall down throughout the day."
4.0,El colorny el peso super... los hilos nonson tan organizados.
4.0,A little on the slimmer side
4.0,"I bought this shirt as a gift for a friend's daughter who is into Dr Who.  The shirt looks like as it does in pic, size is true-to-size, and the shirt quality is better than expected.  Would purchase agaain."
4.0,"Very nice glasses.  Fit my narrow face well and light fitting, not too heavy."
4.0,Hissox thermal socks. These are black knit outside and soft fuzzy warm material on the inside.  I like these socks for when it is cold outside and we are sitting outside watching the sunset. I don't have to put shoes on I just pull these on and go outside.  I hate the cold and I especially don't like my feet and toes getting cold.  These socks prevent that from happening.  Happy with the fit.  I wear a women's size 7.5 and these came about half way up my calf.  Perfect for cold nights.
4.0,I loved the dress. It did run a bit small . I normally wear a large/x large. But just in case I ordered xxl. It was a perfect fit. I am 175 and 5‚Äô7‚Äù. It could have been about 3‚Äù longer in length but it hit about to my knees. Unfortunately it arrived with a small hole on one side of the waist. Since it‚Äôs a lot of trouble to return it I‚Äôm just going to put a little iron-on patch on the underside. I‚Äôm just wearing it around the house anyway. But it is very soft and comfy.
4.0,Very comfortable dress and well made. Great price!
4.0,"Package arrived earlier than date, also the band comes with a clear & silver one- (I got the blue & white band) it‚Äôs so pretty! The only issue is, the band looks like it‚Äôs gonna come off where it connects to the watch. But other than that, nothing else."
4.0,Get a size bigger as it runs small.  If you take a 2x get a 3x!
4.0,I thought this was going to be thicker than it is. I like it but wish there were more bands to make it thicker. I wear it on a daily basis and shower with it on and no issues have shown.
4.0,Casual wear shoe.
4.0,"Love this dress, very on trend with bell sleeves and in great colors. The green dress was slightly different fabric than the grey, with the green being thicker and less drapey. The sleeves are a bit cumbersome when eating but the length of the dress is great, just above knee (I'm 5'8&#34;)."
4.0,"There is nothing wrong with the earrings themselves, they are cute and as pictures. But, they come all mixed together in a plastic case, with backs and earrings separated. This was bought as a gift and I was excited to give looking really cute and presented well. On the upside, mine came with an extra free pair!"
4.0,"Really like the color, length and flow of the material...flawless fit!"
4.0,Very nice they arrived on time
4.0,Good dress good quality but color is different from pictures
4.0,"The outfit is cute, simple, and fits well but the material was a little cheap. Don't expect to stay warm in it but at least you will look cute."
4.0,Really a nice product. The packaging could be improved for a better presentation when giving as a gift but the price is right.
4.0,Still going well after 4 weeks
4.0,Very wide fitting but otherwise good quality
4.0,"It fit well just wish the sleeves were slightly longer. I wore it to watch The Force Awakens. I will wear it around the house now too so my son can answer the question, haha."
4.0,"They are what the day, rubber bracelets. Be careful not to stretch on them too much, the pink one gave and slapped me real hard! I laughed but worried about quality when putting on/off. Nice bracelets regardless and no irritation like others"
4.0,Fabric is so soft. Dress holds up well and is very comfortable. A little long but otherwise great.
4.0,"Nice fabric, adequately stretchy. Prints could be more attractive."
4.0,"Really cute, true to size, lined, and very stretchy!! I usually wear a small but purchased a medium for the length.<br />The skirt is almost identical to the advertised skirt, but it‚Äôs not exact. Love it anyways!"
4.0,these are really pretty and I like them a lot. they fit me fine but I have small wrists. I bought them for gifts
4.0,"Even though I was not happy with the product I ordered.....the company ""Gemkora"" has been great! They have refunded me more than I even spent. Very few companies will go to that length to make their customers happy! Thank you Gemkora."
4.0,This dress fit me very well. It was comfortable to wear. The only negative is that it was a tad sheer even being navy in color.
4.0,"These are great sunglasses for the price! I wear them for beach volleyball and they stay on my face well. The only downside is it takes a little bit for my eyes to get adjusted, but after that, they do a good job. Fun colors too!"
4.0,"The wallet was good, but too big. It didn't fit comfortably into my pockets."
4.0,Cute product and arrived fast. bought one for my friend too. It made a cute gift. The knot came off on one of the strings but I tied it bad. No biggy.
4.0,Bought this for my mom. Its not personally my style but she was happy with it and made me buy two more. She mostly wears Tommy Hilfiger Polos but likes the color options that these give her as well. Now she buys both and is content with her polo selection.
4.0,Good return gift
4.0,"i bought a large iam 5.6 and 139lb and it fit wonderful, Iam a  6-8 US sizes , but if you a size lg Iam sure this dress would fit you like a glove too"
4.0,"Obviously these won't work as trauma scissors but they are so cute. I've been using them for about ten months and they have stood up to everything I've put them up against as an ICU nurse, including bleach wipes almost every shift. I get compliments on them daily, just wish they were a bit bigger."
4.0,"This is a super cute jumpsuit. Unfortunately, I opened the package to  find a quarter size hole in the right leg. Luckily the fabric is dark and loose, you can hardly see the hole. I've washed it and seems to hold up fairly well. The straps seemed a bit long for my daughter, but she is on the petite side. Went out for dinner and got about a dozen - &#34;what an adorable outfit&#34;"
4.0,They‚Äôre cute and work well but they are more of a child‚Äôs size.
4.0,I ordered this and a PinkQueen dress of the same cut and style. This dress runs substantially smaller than the PinkQueen brand runs. Material wise it felt great but I can't believe the difference in sizing. Company was great to work with and sent me my money back. They also provided a shipping label to return the item to them.
4.0,They fit perfectly... Love them
4.0,"Inexpensive, light weight.  This was exactly what I needed to go pick up the mail and transport papers.  It is not a high quality, solid, long-lasting bag.  It is a simple, cheap bag which suits my needs."
4.0,There really cute
4.0,Fits about right (just a little smaller than I'd like) but a little see through. You'd need to wear a thong because panty lines are fairly visible. Likely less of a problem if you order a size up. Nice material and fit
4.0,I like these because feel deal good and separate the toes comfortably.
4.0,You have to make  shure  clasp is engaged or will open
4.0,"This was first granddaughter starting cosmotology, very cute braclet"
4.0,Perfect size easy to put on
4.0,Very nice well made dress but tight in the arms and big in the middle.
4.0,"The little phrase in the bottom corner of the bag doesn‚Äôt translate well. Kind of weird. But it‚Äôs a good bag, no problems so far!"
4.0,"Love the length, stretch, thicker fabric than you'd expect, print is just as pictured. Hides areas I don't love about me. Sad to see this dress is no longer available - I came back to buy another! Only part not great is the sleeves were more loose than I'd like. Great quality for the price!"
4.0,"Nice, lightweight material. I ordered a large and they fit but were a tad too snug. I like my sweat pants to be comfy. I consider myself a size 12 in jeans (not the expensive jeans...I can wear a 8 or 10 in them) I'm 5' 8.5&#34; tall and weigh 150lbs. I measure 37&#34; just below my belly button where the waistband hits me and 43&#34; at the widest part of my butt/hips. I sent the large back and got an XL and they fit nicely. Not too snug, but not baggy either."
4.0,Oversized but very comfy I like it
4.0,This was a gift for my mother. She is very happy with the quality and the style and  loves all of the compartments. She thinks I paid a lot more than I did. I just hope it holds up with time!
4.0,I didn't like that the yoga pants didn't have side pockets.  I like how easy to wear and feel comfortable wearing the pants.
4.0,It was perfect for work and modest which I liked but the top and skirt were a bit see through so I wore legging capris and a white tank top under to make sure nothing was showing but overall it was a great costume
4.0,Very cute and didn't cause skin irritation like the leather ones. But the ends started peeling away from the connectors to the watch after a couple months of use. Had to fix
4.0,Nice I haven't try them but feel  alittle loss I like the look just hope they won't give me any problems so for now OK üëå
4.0,Love it! I need another one.
4.0,"Very sleek and trendy a bit small,but other than that very cool"
4.0,My grandson liked the PJ's but they were way too small.  Returned them for Size 10.  He is not a big child and is 7 years old.  The 10 fits well and he stayed in them all day.
4.0,"This crossbody sling bag is lightweight, has good compartments inside. However the sewing of the zipper and strap was not well made. I had to cut the extra thread hoping that the rest of the thread would stay put. The zipper begins to become loose, so I have to check from time to time that the zipper don‚Äôt go halfway open to make sure contents of the sling bag don‚Äôt come out."
4.0,Come as expected.
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt know it was 2 pieces but it worked fine. Fit below my knees so I was happy. I wasn‚Äôt interested in wearing anything super short around children. Made for a fun, comfortable night"
4.0,"Like it a lot, may order in another color."
4.0,The legs are too long. I am 5'3 and they are sagging.
4.0,"Very pretty and they go well with the dresses I purchased, but be forewarned that the crystal is bigger than expected."
4.0,"I really like this top. It's cute, comfy, and color-fast after many washes. My one disappointment was that I imagined it being more a-line and flowy- it's not. But otherwise it fits as expected and I wear it often."
4.0,"good cushion, bike seat more comfortable.  could use more cushion"
4.0,Well made though run small. Super warm. Men‚Äôs large is very very tight for 36‚Äù waist.
4.0,"Looks just like picture, def recommended"
4.0,It was cute.
4.0,"I Love the style of this suit and after reading the reviews about sizing I ordered a 44. The torso is a little large so  I have ordered the 42 and am waiting to see if that fits better. The bottom of this suit is perfect so I might just remove the padded bra cups and deal with the larger top. With the bra cups in, the suit moves my boobs up over my actual ones! :) The skirt is so cute and flattering and the blue polka dot color is great too!"
4.0,Great watch just hard to read the numbers because of glare
4.0,"very nice quality, takes awhile to ship though"
4.0,"Good quality tank, medium fit as expected."
4.0,"Great color, good fit, timely shipping. These leggings are very comfortable."
4.0,"I like this way more than I thought I would! Very comfortable and flattering. My one and only criticism is that i thought it might be a little more smoothing in the back but the material there is more flimsy and moves around easily rather than holding you in. Otherwise it fits great. I‚Äôm a 36C and I ordered a large. More of an around the house bra. Pretty enough to wear with high waisted jeans, though!"
4.0,This dress is so comfy. I am 5'2 and normally wear a M but got a L because of the sizing reviews. It goes to my ankles and is fitting but loose enough to not feel clingy.
4.0,"Okay. So the Brown Color is a Dark Rich Brown, the Color shown is more of a Tawny/Reddish Brown. *it's weird, if you look at MY photo(s). The Color when it's a Tawny/Reddish Brown, is when taken near Light Bulb Light, the last photo of my 3, where it looks darker was taken in Florescent Light (either way they're an attractive brown). I hope I didn't just make things more confusing. Okay. So I have a sort-of skinny foot, if I had fat chubby feet I'd say they may be too tight at the actually foot part. I also do not have chubby calves, and there is an adequate amount of extra room there as well. They are pretty comfortable, but by hour 8-10 they do start to ache, my feet/legs that is. I own many of these boots in a variety of colors. The first thing I do before I wear them outside is buy a quality suede water-repellent and spray them generously, and even once a month or every other month, especially at the foot part. I live where it's Snowy/Rainy. I've had my oldest pairs for 4.5yrs now and the Suede still looks really good, although mind you I do baby my footwear. *Also I did have to adjust the Belt at the Crown of the Foot and at the Top of the Boot, but like I said, I have skinnier feet/calves. AND... **A HOLE is NOT there to adjust to make them Tighter either, so I had to take them to a Shoe Guy and Have him punch me a new hole, that's really the only draw back."
4.0,This is a quality shirt. The material is nice and it didn't shrink up when washed.
4.0,"I'm 5'9 and got the L which fits perfectly, but........... I was expecting the quilted part to be a bit bigger to cover the whole chest like on the showcasing pic, not slice half way over the tatas. Other than that, I'm rockin it ü§ò"
4.0,"Very cute, though the fabric is thinner than I had imagined."
4.0,Would have preferred a solid design as shown!
4.0,"This a very well put together outfit. The pants fitted great the the top was a little small, giving that I‚Äôm busty! This is a great outfit and the material is stretchable and nice."
4.0,"It is what was described. It‚Äôs an inexpensive plastic prop. And that‚Äôs OK especially for the price.Fine for a kid and fine for halloween. None of the buttons, doors, lights, or rollers operate in any way but that‚Äôs Ok for why it is and acceptable for the price."
4.0,Shirt is super cute and comfy! What was expected for the price and can‚Äôt wait to be festive and wear it!
4.0,"It does its job well, and it's not too expensive."
4.0,I had to buy 2.  My dog lost the charm in one day.  I took measures with the replacement to securely attach them with small fishing split rings.  I attached the charm from the extra necklace to my other dog's collar.  Now mom and her dog match and they match each other.  If I ever find the lost charm I will put it on my Keychain.
4.0,"I wore this for an Oktoberfest party!  It fit perfectly, I used the measurements.  Good quality!  Very happy with the construction and design."
4.0,"These glasses work great and feel very comfortable! They have an obvious blue reflection, so anyone can tell they are blue light glasses. Which for some people may be alright and for others is annoying. Overall a good quality product for the price."
4.0,"Loved the boots, but too small."
4.0,Bought this for my wife as a surprise gift and she really like it. Liked the color and softness. I heard about this company of Pandora and took a gamble and it paid off.
4.0,I love this purse. It is so roomy and it is just the right size. I will say that sometimes the strap gets odd over time and the hook likes to move around. But otherwise I love this purse. It fits everything you want. :-) I get tons of compliments about the purse. :-)
4.0,Short.  Material has no stretch.  Cute pattern but I wish it had been cut diagonally.  I have hips and the horizontal pattern makes them look even bigger.
4.0,"I like the longer sleeves, but its just too much money for a tshirt that doesnt &#34;wow&#34;"
4.0,"About what yippy would expect from a shirt at this price range. It is on the small side, though things are always tight on my upper arms. Put together well, though, the buttons were sewn on well, the seams even"
4.0,Looks cuter online than in person. Was too small and I just wasn't feeling it. Returned it with no problems.
4.0,"I do like the dress.  I wear a 38D bra and I ordered a size 14.  Perhaps the 16 would fit better in the chest but then the bottom may be too large.  The way it fits now, if I sneeze the buttons may pop open!  I may just wear a cardigan over it to cover the bust area.  The dress material and style is good so I think I may keep it."
4.0,Exactly what I wanted. Very attractive and convenient to use.
4.0,"This is all around really good. It's really pretty and sturdy and I would recommend buying it for anyone who does have small wrists. I have small wrists and I bought the smallest size they had and when I tried it on, it almost fit perfectly but it was just a tad too big and it wouldn't tighten anymore.<br /><br />But besides that, I'd definitely recommend buying it!"
4.0,Cute for me
4.0,"It's very large, great quality, but the pin itself is very dull, making it hard to push through fabric"
4.0,I ordered this for my daughter. She loves it. The color is perfect.
4.0,"I‚Äôve wanted a little hoop in my cartilage for the longest time, but I don‚Äôt want to go through the whole healing process. That is where I found these. They have been working well: no color deterioration, comfortable to use (depending on the size and placement), and they look so real that multiple people asked me where I got them. I would definitely recommend because they are great for the price"
4.0,"Cute shirt, but had a less than perfect fit."
4.0,The color and print is great. My daughter loves the pockets. It‚Äôs a little large so I had to size down.
4.0,"Really pretty, but they fit a little small on my earlobes."
4.0,I am 5'5 height...my weight is...183...I ordered a XL...and it fit great...I was reluctant but the material was stretchy and I felt comfortable and classy...great buy..considering another  purchase of a different color...
4.0,Super cute and would have given 5 stars except the ruffle trim on one strap is only half &#34;ruffled&#34;.
4.0,I like the wood and the design. Lenses are some dark.
4.0,"Beautiful, though the detail can be missed as the definition is subtle.  Pretty with the right outfit, it is all a matter of taste."
4.0,"The pendant is very pretty n sparkles but the chain is not good, silver was flaking off when i opened it. The color is lighter than pic more of a coral, peachy color than orange, but for the price not bad just put it on another chain."
4.0,"I thought this would be small clutch-sized. In reality, it‚Äôs very large, more like a small purse. Besides that, I really liked the color and the style."
4.0,"The shirt is great, but I'm a bit unimpressed with the button locations. They should be moved over a bit to prevent gap for chesty gals."
4.0,"Nice but smaller than I thought. I like the screw backs, just hard to line up because they are so small."
4.0,"I like the fact that these no show socks include the gel heel. It still  rolls off my heel occasionally, but not as much as no show socks without. I'm a size 9 1/2 and these fit me pretty well."
4.0,"Bigger/wider than expected...I can almost fit my MacBook in there! It's a good size - should be able to fit a lot. Yes, there are compartments.<br /><br />The gold hardware on the purse is not as understated as I thought but it looks fine not tacky.<br /><br />My bag didn't smell fishy. I can see how someone could think the scent of the bag was &#34;fishy,&#34; but as far as the one I got, you can tell it's the material not catfish!<br /><br />Overall, it's a cute, cozy bag and I'm looking forward to wearing it for fall."
4.0,"The Hoodie itself is Great! Big,soft & comfortable..But! It does NOT look like the Neon Pink in the Photo!"
4.0,I had to return my first 2 jackets. Sad cause I really like the style. The first the color want as expected. The second the stitching starred comming out at the cross seem in the armpit. The third seems to be ok thus far. It is an extreemly warm and comfortable jacket. Despite the minor setbacks I had. It is well worth the money. Amazon corrected my issues quickly and hassle free.
4.0,Absolutely love this. It holds. Only down side is that the zipper shows through most fabrics
4.0,"Bought for my 16 year old daughter. They fit great. The clip is a bit bulky, and you can see her glasses frame through the lens."
4.0,one of the bands did't fit so  i had to buy different pins
4.0,Nice dress- loved the top half of the dress but the bottom material was a little too stiff and thick for my liking.  It also was too large so I had to return it so I recommend ordering a size smaller than you think you would wear.
4.0,"I'm very pleased with this skort.  The material is lightweight and perfect for hot weather.  The white shorts underneath make it so the skort is not transparent (still wouldn't wear it with red underwear) although it does mean the bottom portion is more transparent than the top, so if that bothers you it could be an issue.  For me the faint outline of legs isn't a big deal.  It is a bit big, I wish it came in an extra-small.  I'm 5'6&#34;, 110lbs for reference and the waist is loose on me with a small gap.  The drawstring allows me to cinch it enough that it's okay, it won't fall off, but there is some space there.  If you were to tuck a shirt in that would probably solve most of the problem.  Overall I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend this skirt."
4.0,Have received compliments on the hat
4.0,"I haven't worn them yet, however they are not cheaply put together... I can't wait to wear them... Wonder if I will ever go out again????"
4.0,Nice lifevest it‚Äôs tight fitting runs a little large though but fits very tight<br /><br />only negative feedback is the stitching at the bottom unraveled after about a half a season of use.<br /><br />Remember it‚Äôs not an official US Coast Guard approved life jacket it‚Äôs more of a sport vest so if you need more floatability then this is not the vest for you.<br /><br />However it‚Äôs very sporty and gives you a lot of freedom when you‚Äôre surfing as that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs designed for
4.0,I bought the bracelets for a Christmas gift. My niece loved them.
4.0,"This cheeky hoodie is perfect for the day after you hit the town hard & are recuperating w/ Netflix. It is stylish & comfy and I was impressed that the lettering looks so professional... but ACHTUNG: it runs small.  I ordered an XL and at 6'0' and 160 lbs, I didn't have a prayer of fitting in the Asian/International sizing. Luckily, my college-age niece is a petite thing and she loves it; her friends now want matching ones so they can have thematic &#34;hung over&#34; days."
4.0,"Okay. It was what I wanted, just a little small."
4.0,Like it a lot.  Super cute and durable.  Can wear it when working as well so that a super plus !
4.0,"This is a great top for lounging or hanging out. It's not thick, but it's great for a lightweight, casual wear"
4.0,"nice, but length is couple of inches less"
4.0,I'm usually not a big fan of maxi dresses but I bought this for Halloween as part of a witch costume. I probably could have gone a size smaller than I did but overall I am happy with the dress and how it fits. It will work well for my purposes although I don't know if I would choose to wear it as a regular part of my wardrobe.
4.0,"I bought these as part of a costume chest for my toddler. Now he can be a super hero or a vampire.  He loves sneaking up on you and flashing his teeth.  It's a great, cheap addition to the chest.  With the addition of a few simple capes, the whole family can join in the fun.<br /><br />Worth noting, these are cheap.  They make everyone who wears them slobber, and are not the most comfortable.  They are not meant for long term wear and will likely not last years and years... but for the price they are perfect fun."
4.0,The fabric is everything! Sooo soft and comfortable. It's shorter than I'd like it to be so I am returning it. It comes maybe 3 inches above the knees. Super cute tho!
4.0,"Super comfy, pattern and look as pictured.  If I had to complain it would be the length of the legs and the crotch area.  I'm 5'3 so it's a bit much, but like it just fine."
4.0,Great quality clothing for the price!
4.0,It's a very lovely dress but It wasn't as I expected at all. It's not as long not as nor as flowely as the picture. You might be able to wear it as an informal brides made dress but that's even questionable. I was suppose to wear it at a 30th anniversary party but it wasn't dressy enough. I love the dress so I'm going to keep it. üòä
4.0,"I have been looking for substantial sweats/fleece, but keep find light weight, flimsy ones that would not keep a bear warm and that don't last very long.  I certainly could not find anything even approaching what I wanted in women's clothing.  I began looking in men's clothing and found more of the same in mind numbing search ...<br /><br />I found this shirt.  It is a nice sturdy medium weight with well constructed seams.  It washes without noticeable bleeding, fading, or piling.  That it came in purple was a plus as I could wear it to my grandsons sporting events.<br /><br />The reason for 4 rather 5 stars is that it is pricey."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I got these. Of course the quality isn't outstanding, but the claw clasp and multiple lengths of adjustment were far more than I expected. These go great with most all the outfits I were and they look pretty good. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,I ordered black. I went over this 3 or 4 times. maybe I still did it wrong. couldn't be troubled to go through a return ----so just made another purchase &#34;black&#34; -----I hope----- the blue ones!!!------ will go to one of the grandkids<br />Thanks<br />Arnold Jeffrey
4.0,"I like these socks. I wanted to love them but the band is a little tight. I'm 5'6 and these go past my knee. Everything is spelled right and exactly as pictured. I will be wearing these until my daughter learns to read lol. Theyou are alittle big for me as well, since the heel is up near my ankle. Other than that, these are a great buy.<br />*disclaimer* I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This is my personal experience and opinion on this product."
4.0,I like the too it is just really thick and stiff even after a few washes.
4.0,"Seems to be good plastic. I like the number of sleeves, seems to have more than most wallet inserts, which allows me to fit all of my cards"
4.0,Ring is very cute but I thought the flower and stones were a bit larger
4.0,Absolutely love these gauges except they really are glass.. I dropped the purple 1 time and it chipped a huge piece off the side so I couldn't wear it anymore.. but they're really beautiful
4.0,"This dress is surprisingly wonderful! There's stretch in the whole dress, but the top is more of a cotton blend and the bottom is silk-like. It's flowy and flattering and overall fits well. The only thing to keep in mind is the length. I am 5'11 and ordered a medium and the dress falls about 3 inches off the ground. I anticipated that upon ordering, so I was not disappointed, but felt it important to share."
4.0,Warrens fit well worked out well. Fork - tiny disproportionate.
4.0,Slightly lower rise and snugger through the hips than I expected. Fits nicely on thighs. Hidden pocket too small to be useful.
4.0,"smaller than anticipated, but looks great."
4.0,Only brand I purchase from Amazon.
4.0,"Manufactured with inexpensive material but they look good and are very polarized. When I look at my computer screen with them on, the images disappear."
4.0,"It's a tad bit smaller than I had hoped, but, large enough for overnight, or a carry on for a plane trip. I love the look of it, and it seems to be made very well."
4.0,"I liked the material and overall fit, but the arm holes were a little too large and showed the sides of my bra. Also, the collar on the back flopped up and didn't lay flat. I think the next size down would be too small."
4.0,The hat and gloves are very soft inside and out. Washed nicely. It is never easy to put mittens on a squirmy baby. The hat runs small. It is a fairly snug fit even though it is for 12-months and the baby is only 7-months and just an average sized baby girl.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3966e17172826e5120191b0b48865bf1]] Comfortable sweat suite that you could dress up. The reason for the one star is because if you lift your arms your breast will be out of the top. The material is very soft and not heavy at all. Cute fall look!
4.0,"Got as a gift, my mother in law wears this daily chain is sturdy just wish that it was a little longer, but the charm is beautiful."
4.0,My daughter loves this bag!  The color is beautiful and it has lots of pockets.  Perfect for hiking and adventures!
4.0,Works good after awhile they roll down from the top
4.0,"This is a great belt. Takes a little trial-and-error to set the tightness you like, but once set, very secure. Feels just right enough to hold pants up, but doesn't feel like it's stretching like some of the leather belts I've used in the past."
4.0,"After buying a dress like this in the past, I was looking for one just like it and came across these. I decided to get them in varying sizes in green, teal, and this color. I wished it was a bit more on the purple side, but it is advertised as purple-gray. The material is thin and a bit sheer, and can wrinkle after you iron it. The length is fine but if I put up my arms it goes to about mid-thigh. I use these dresses casually or dress it up with a jacket but they are perfect for simple activities or events and are cheap too!"
4.0,"Liked the color, fabric, and length. However it is smaller than I expected. I don‚Äôt want to return it because I really like the color.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 123# and normally wear size 2 in bottoms."
4.0,My daughters theme was cats she loves them. So I order this for her birthday party she loved it and the shirt fit perfectly the skirt did too but the straps are a little to long. Had to improvise since I don‚Äôt have a sewing kit and wrapped it as a bow around her waist !
4.0,"Good quality belt but recently I‚Äôve developed a problem with withdrawing the prong from the hole, so I need to get this fixed or replace it."
4.0,the first few times you were them the inside bottom of the thongs cut into your feet.
4.0,"The tights are very warm but short. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô10 and the crotch on them is very low, BUT they do cover my stomach. Other than that they‚Äôre very nice"
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, but it was too small for me across the bust so I had to return it"
4.0,Great quality!<br />I sized down to a small and it still fit a little loose around the chest. Will probably have to pin it. But otherwise it‚Äôs super cute!<br /><br />You can also wear it As a kimono or swim cover!
4.0,"the dress is nice i love it i ordered a medium and i weigh 140 lb and am 5ft tall my only issue with this dress is the fit , i usually get a large in any dress does not matter what brand but based on the review and reading the sizes on the description i got a medium instead and it fit a bit loose ! i would have liked it to be more tight/ or bodycon or hug my curves but it didnt the top of the dress looked and fit nice but the bottom however was loose so thats really my only issue with the dress ."
4.0,Runs smaller size up but is a super cute shirt and nice fabric
4.0,"This was exactly the style of bag I was looking for, but my one complaint, if you can believe it, is that there were too many pockets.  While I appreciate the ability to organize and separate, I thought the number of pockets was overdone, and I feared I would spend more time opening zippers trying to remember what I put where.  I found another style from Volcanic Rock called ""Women Multi Pocket Crossbody Bag Large Shoulder Bag Lightweight Purse and Handbags Travel Pocketbooks"" which is very, very similar.  There are a few subtle differences, namely one large pocket in the back and one of the interior pockets seemed larger and big enough to hold my camera and a spare lens.  The styles are the same as is the price point."
4.0,"As the maid of honor for my best friends wedding I purchased this set for all 7 of the ladies in the wedding (not including the bride). The set is beautiful and fits well. It will look great in the wedding photos because they are very shiny and from a distance or in photos looks very expensive. The only complaints I have are that up close you can tell it isn't an expensive set and the thick part of the necklace is stiff so if it goes crooked, it sits on ur neckline weird. The bride loves them and I recieved them 2 days after placing the order. This is a set that I will wear again and do not regret purchasing!"
4.0,"Beautiful, but really a mans size bracelet."
4.0,Wraps my wrist really well - I have a very large wrist. Seems like this will fit everyone. Clock is small but is OK. Love the leather!
4.0,"Only four stars because it seems very fragile and im kinda scared to wash it even on delicate and bu itself. But toher than that its GORG! Inweqr a size Small and thats what I got. It fit perfect, but the chest area is a tad revealing even with a sports bra. It gives MAJOR SIDE BOOB. But would go sooo cute with a wide band or crop top sports bra!"
4.0,"Material was perfect, but the width was a bit wide"
4.0,They looked great in my girlfriend
4.0,I returned it because it was way too large for me.  It was a nice hat though.
4.0,"Cute bottoms, too dosnr sit against chest and has very little support"
4.0,"I loved the mixing of  colors of the beads. But the beads were dull, no shine"
4.0,I want to give these 5 stars but the lens screws that keep the glasses attached broke within the first week of me just standing and talking to a friend. Lucky my hubby is clever and fixed them! But great glasses. I bought them after a snapchat filter! Not cheap quality. I want to buy more!!!
4.0,The shoe fits as I thought it would. Great shoe to work in all day.
4.0,I've used this several times when traveling. The compression zipper has gotten stuck several times.  You need to tuck the material in as you zip it shut.
4.0,"Perfect for layering in the fall and winter. The material is kinda thin, not quite sweater material but not like a t-shirt either. Ordered a small (5'2"" 115 lbs) and it fits well. The only thing I don't really like is how the neckline lays but that's just me being picky"
4.0,Nicely made and a perfect gift for mom
4.0,"For the price I paid, these are nice sunglasses. Fashionable and comfortable. I would buy them again."
4.0,I really liked this dress for a brief 20's party!<br />The sequins scraped under the arms tho!üò™
4.0,Great color. Son love it.
4.0,"Good fabric,  good tailoring and good fit"
4.0,My daughter loves these shoes. They fit as expected.
4.0,"I have read a lot of the reviews and suggest that you stick with your size. If you are a medium, get a medium. 4 stars are because the material is a little different from the usual material for swim wear, but nothing to worry too much about."
4.0,This is a great shirt. I'm going to Hawaii soon and I live the feel of the fabric and the design.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it smelled really bad out of the bag. Not a new fabric smell but a sour stinch.  I was doing laundry the day it came in so in washed it immediately and that resolved the smell.  A medium is normally a snug fit on me this was slightly larger which is expected for this type of shirt so no disappointment.  It looks good and feels good. Can't wait to get it on the beach.
4.0,"Just received, seems really nice and cool for hot days. It is more transparent though and see through than I usually wear...will be good for layering."
4.0,I like the ring because stainless steel will not tarnish and it appears to be well made for the price. The edges were not sharp as some others have stated so maybe that issue was corrected. It also came sooner than expected.
4.0,Nice bag but bigger than I wanted. I love the sleeve on the back. It sits nicely on top of my carry on bag. I just wish that it was a little smaller. Nicely made. Worth the money.
4.0,"A little long, but I'm not that tall. Otherwise, fit great, feel good, love the pockets!"
4.0,The colors are vibrant. They are a lot thinner than the average silicone bracelets
4.0,"A heavy watch, don't get it wet! It works great and a lot of people comment on it. It was large for my wrist, but easy for me to adjust it by removing links (drive the pins out, remove link, drive pins back in). I like it..."
4.0,"Fits great and looks great. Time, stopwatch, and timer functions have been working flawlessly, interface is large and legible without being comically large like most other watches with these functions. Altimeter and compass capabilities seem a little off, but I‚Äôll continue to experiment and hopefully I‚Äôll be able to dial it in with calibration. The pushers have some protection beneath them to prevent unintentional button presses, and they work great."
4.0,Replaced the factory pins on my Steinhart Ocean One ceramic and Deep Blue Diver with the Marathon ones<br />Very durable and well made
4.0,"I love wool socks, and pattern ones even more, these are bright and colorful, I wear them with sandles or boots. I just wish they were a bit taller."
4.0,"This item was looked at because of the security it gives when carrying credit/debit cards.  After I received this item, I tested it and it worked as advertised. I  highly recommend the purchase as, unfortunately, today, one has got to be VERY  astute with ones security.  I am a 79 year old disabled United States Air Force veteran, and I have witnessed just how the citizens of the world can no longer be trusted, especially those who have not given their soles to the one person who gave His life saving our soles from eternal hell.<br /><br />(You folks may not wish to reprint my statement above, which is certainly your prerogative.  BUT, you need to know that what I have stated above IS THE TRUTH.  Serving my country, I was a part of  a bunch of loyal Americans willing to pay to whatever required.  I was witness to the protection and healing grace of our Savior, Jesus Christ.  The Holy Son of our Creator God is real and is more than willing to protect, heal and keep us from damnation in hell for eternity.  If any of you folks have not given your souls to Jesus Christ, I strongly recommend you do so for He is on His way back.)"
4.0,Great quality and perfect fit!  Our elf was perfect addition to the holiday market!
4.0,"Delivered on time, no hassles. These things really do cool you on a hot day."
4.0,"Love the sweatshirt but it is NOT true to size at all. I had to buy a 1X in hopes I would receive a loose comfy fit, you know the kind of sweatshirt that looks like a dress and covers your ass? Not this one. Fits over my head and in the sleeve part fine. But the length is not what I was expecting. The 1X fits on me how a size large would fit. Literally my ONLY complaint on the sweatshirt"
4.0,"Ordered a medium, I'm 5'7 about 165lbs and felt they were just a tad short for my personal preferences. They fit well otherwise, not too tight or too loose."
4.0,"I bought this sweater in both grey and black and love them! BUT BE WARNED...the &quot;one size&quot; will not fit anyone bigger than a size small! I am 5'2&quot;, 115lbs, 34D-DD and it fits me perfect. It is not oversized as it looks on the model but it does stretch out a bit from when it is first taken out of the packaging. I didn't have any bad smells coming from mine like other people did, no rips, no tears, no unravelling. These are really good quality: thick and warm. I have not washed them yet but I have a feeling they will shrink if washed hot or dried so just be careful!"
4.0,This is a gift but looks to be of good quality.
4.0,"Second time ordering. Works great for me. Great shipping w/ Prime. I wear a lot of hats, and my head is between a M & L, so hard to fit. This product makes the fit fine.<br />-David Allen"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d54d34892d7862738b8351e0336e5653]] Feels secure. Looks good, comfortable. If this is the style you're after, itll work."
4.0,"I purchased +2.00, but I have to take them off and use my +2.00 readers to see what I wan to see. Not sure if they are labeled wrong."
4.0,CUte dress and comfy... nice under blazer for work
4.0,Fits snug but comfy. Soft perfect for the beach
4.0,"It‚Äôs made of a nice, light material. This will be great for spring!"
4.0,This swimsuit is very cute! Very flattering when you are self conscious of your belly.
4.0,really comfortable to wear and keeps me cool
4.0,"Nice, comfy, may run a bit small, (maybe half a size small or a little more?) we ordered up a size, seems perfect. My son washed & wore maybe 3 times so far, and it's holding up just fine. Way better price than name brands, quality seems great."
4.0,"Love the material, it fit perfect everywhere except in the breast area. I purchased the 2XL and I usually wear an XL.  OMG the top had my top flat, arms fit, waist fit....had to send back."
4.0,"No way to tighten, so it's snug to fit. Advisory: order a size up! I'm a 10.5 in Timberlands but 11.5 for these."
4.0,"Socks super comfortable, after you get them on.  However I evidently ordered a size too small.  Tore my nails and Worked up a sweat putting on and again pulling off.  I have ordered another pair a size larger."
4.0,"The boots are absolutely gorgeous! I would expect nothing less from Tommy Hilfiger. The boots are well made and extremely fashionable. I normally wear 7w, so I ordered 7.5. The fit is ok. It is a little snug at the widest part of the foot and it took 2 wears to break in the stiffness near the ankles. Since they were a gift, I kept them and wore them. They broke in well."
4.0,"I've only had these flip-flops for a week now, but they fit good and feel great. I always pick up reef sandals and these are a great deal for the price. If they last 3 years like my other reefs then they will be well worth it."
4.0,Nice socks for my running around 18 month old son... I love the rubber at the bottom so he doesn't slip. Good quality
4.0,Fit just right. Needed these for a Deadpool Costume.
4.0,"Fits as expected. Thin material but not really cheap looking. It‚Äôs actually a cute, cheap (in price) dress"
4.0,"It was a beautiful dress. I wish it fit me. It was too big at the top. I have small, narrow shoulders so it didn't look good on me."
4.0,"I purposely waited two months to give this review to try to ensure it was as real as possible. This ring was used in place of real diamonds, frankly because they're overrated and overpriced. It's beautiful. It shines like it's real and it's gotten tons of compliments. The ONLY negative to this ring is it is sharp. Either the clasps that holds the stone in place or the stone itself, but it's somehow managed to scratch and cut me twice already. It's fine but I just don't sleep with the rings on. Overall, they're perfect. None of the stones have fallen out or seem like they're about to and they haven't turned my fingers green, even when getting wet. I love them!"
4.0,Fun gag gift for a bridal shower
4.0,Gave 4 stars because it‚Äôs cute and fits good but it‚Äôs very itchy inside if you don‚Äôt wear something long sleeved under it
4.0,"is a very nice swimsuit,but the sizes are not the same as american hence runs small"
4.0,"I LOVE the concept of this. I'm a massage therapist and my fiance bought me this after he proposed so that I would always have my ring with me. So easy to use, doesn't scratch up your ring anymore than normal wear would.<br /> Only 4 stars because on day 3 of wearing this, as I was taking off my shirt, two of my fingers caught on the necklace and it was a GENTLE tug and the necklace broke. Luckily I am still able to hook it on one last ring, but it's definitely not sturdy enough if someone was to grab and run. (You can replace with a sturdier necklace)<br />With this in mind, I've been more careful and moving it out of the way when changing tops/sweaters.<br />I've had this necklace for a month now, and I wear it ALL THE TIME, the sunflower petals have not lost it's color at all."
4.0,"Got this for my fianc√© and he likes it a lot. Keeps his face really warm, and there are little vents at the mouth so you aren't breathing through fabric, which he really likes. Only complaint he has is that sometimes its hard for him to velcro it really tight, so I have to help him. But besides that, works great!!"
4.0,"Cute dress but too short for me! I ordered an xl from reading reviews, I'm a 16/18. Nice material."
4.0,Loved the tutu just wished it was thicker!
4.0,Has a great fit and is very elegant.
4.0,for the price it could of been better quality. Its good tho. give it one wash maybe. the odor  from the ink is noticeable
4.0,"The dress itself is gorgeous. I am about 4'11 and 105 pounds. It flowed perfectly, not too long with my 3 inch heels on. I gave it a 4 stars because the sleeves were kinda tight. I only wore it for 20 minutes and my arms started feeling tingly. Wish it was a lil looser, otherwise the dress was ALMOST perfect. &#60;3"
4.0,"The product is good quality. However, my only complaint is that it took weeks to be delivered. In the meantime, I purchased a like item elsewhere. Therefore, I am returning this."
4.0,Very nice dress but xl was too small :( i normaly use L but decided to size up and still no luck
4.0,I like the color but the over all style is not form fix at all. I kind feel like I am wearing a maternity top.
4.0,Fits as expected. The material is cheap but I suspected that would be the case based off the price.
4.0,"Cosy, absorbent for winter activities"
4.0,It's a bit thin. But beautiful love it. I'm 5' 110 pounds.
4.0,"When these first came, I was quiet disappointed as they are thin and seemed so cheaply made that I was sure they would fall apart in no time at all after just a few trips through the washing machine.<br /><br />However, have been using these for 7 months now - several times a week - and they are holding up fine.<br /><br />For exercising indoors in a gym without a hat, they are not as good as the more common thicker terry cloth headbands, as they are not as absorbent. However, for wearing outdoors playing tennis in the hot Texas sun they work much better than regular headbands which are too bulky to wear under a hat.<br /><br />Might have to change bands a couple of times in a set - but they are much more comfortable, and cooler, than regular headbands are when a hat is worn over them for protection from the sun.<br /><br />I just ordered another couple of packs."
4.0,A little too stiff for my liking
4.0,"Since other reviewers said these were roomy, I ordered a size smaller than I usually would. I should've stuck with my regular size. These pajamas are very nice, but just not my style. I ended up returning them."
4.0,Good product.No complaints here.
4.0,Not bad for price point. They look good and are good to see thru. And they won't breakn the bank of you happen to lose them (which I.did). Ill probsbly order another pair soon.
4.0,"Over all I liked it. There are a few different ways that you can wear this headband. The material is thin which is good so you can fold over the extra over your ears.The only way I did not like it was over the head and neck, they showed this in one of their pictures. It is not long or big enough to go over the back of your head and/or cover your neck. Other then that it works great as a head band and just around your neck. Over all it is really cute and fun. If you would like to see my video review click on the link, it will send you to my youtube page. I have never been able to upload videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-2bCWaFpKQ<br />I received this product for free/discounted in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,It was too big and I sent it back/
4.0,"Nice, but I noticed they are kind of turning green.  After wearing a day or two the wide part kind of turns out sideways."
4.0,Gorgeous! Flimsy. Polarized!
4.0,I wish it didn't have a split on the side. Other than that... looooove iiiiiiit!
4.0,"LOVE the colors on this. The skirt fit well and was comfortable.<br /><br />Let's talk about the top though. It is not long enough to cover your boobs if you are large on top. I could kind of roll them into the top but if I raised my arms, they would kind of poke out. So buying a different top to go with this outfit. Hoping to find something longer."
4.0,"This is a cute cardigan overall, though the cut is really strange. It still looks good but definitely took some getting used to.<br /><br />It is very thick but not very soft. The color in the images is pretty accurate.<br /><br />Overall, I like it and will use it during colder days."
4.0,I like them.  These are my first flat boots so it took some getting use to.  Otherwise I like them a lot.  Wish they had have sizes.
4.0,"Love the suit but even though reviews showed it fit to size, I find it a bit snug."
4.0,"They will be great under shirts, but that's all i think i will wear them for. they are a bit smaller that i was thinking"
4.0,Stains easily
4.0,"So far, this product is amazing. I am a professional oversleeper and after experiencing the zap, I can imagine that being an issue any longer.  I also love that I can share the app access with my boyfriend so he can alert me when he is out of town if needed."
4.0,Overall I liked the dress.  I got a lot of compliments.
4.0,Cute costume. It‚Äôs quality it ok. It has survived after several washings. The fabric is shiny and it drapes well. The top runs a bit small. Overall Good buy.
4.0,"I am your average sized 5'7"" female (not plus size, not petite/slim). I ordered the Large gloves and they fit my hands perfectly and go almost all the way up to my elbows. The upper arm elastic is very snug (I have thicker/athletic-built forearms), so the gloves don't roll down my forearms. The gloves do get a little more narrow in the wrist area. Made with heavy material (not flimsy like the traditional dishwashing gloves that you might pick up at the grocery store). I have only used them once so I can't comment on how many washes they can be used for before losing their integrity."
4.0,"comfortable and waist size was accurrate.But,the material was a little lighter than I like and the leg length was a little shorter than i'm used to.Overall good quality."
4.0,I though I was tan but I‚Äôm not as tan as this sleeve. It‚Äôs very comfy & cool. It covers my tattoos completely
4.0,Ordered a size up because that was recommended. Order your size. IF you're a borderline M/L get Large.
4.0,"I really like the watch.  I do wish it had the back lighting/illumination, as it's easier for me to see the black letters/numbers on a lighter screen and the glowing back illumination gives a more consistent illumination across the face of the watch.  The contrasting orange and green look great together!"
4.0,"I was very pleased.  Love the feel of the fabric and how well it lays.  It's not clingy at all and doesn't show the &#34;plump&#34; areas in my back, which a lot of shirts do. It fit perfectly. I am 5'4&#34;, 170 lbs, and got an XL. Love the paisley pattern."
4.0,Looking forward to walking in them to check their durability- but really nice so far.
4.0,Great for a fan with a Beard
4.0,I really like the fit. I'm a little OCD and the stripes dont match so in that respect it was disappointing.
4.0,They are a little on the thin side but so very soft and the size is nice..Colors are great!  I would recommend.
4.0,Its hard to find the hole to put the string through...is there supposed to be one ? I still get confused on how to tie it to where my cleavage doesn‚Äôt show. Overall beautiful dress üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,Liked pocket for handwarmer.  Nice style.  Did not like the velcro straps.
4.0,Love this shirt very well made I just may order again
4.0,"It's comfy, fits well and my purchase arrived sooner than expected."
4.0,"Have them (6)pairs in different patterns , love them all. Swashbuckled and dry well. Some steam at end you‚Äôre good to go"
4.0,"I love crosses, that's why I purchased this, it helps you find your keys faster, product got here rather quickly, plan on buying more, for gifts."
4.0,I loved this dress!!! It was just a little snug so I returned it and ordered the next size . Wow what a mistake!!! The large was very very large!! The arm holes were huge!  I  really wish one of them would have fit . The material was beautiful..... just perfect for the outdoor wedding I was going to wear it to!
4.0,"Smaller then I thought, but good quality silk and well made."
4.0,"Super colorful, lots of compliments. However, it's no easier to breathe in than others masks."
4.0,"I love the design on this shirt and the stickers are a cool bonus, but the fabric is super uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve had a T-shirt as rough and scratchy feeling as this before."
4.0,"It eventually broke, but it was super cute. Lots of compliments. Very affordable"
4.0,"True to size. 5'7 and 170 lbs 36B and medium fit fine. The only thing that I don't like is the cut on the butt. It's the cut that's in style right now that isn't quite a thong, yet not quite full coverage either."
4.0,Nice fit but a little plain for me.
4.0,Perfect. Very comfortable
4.0,this is a beautifully embroidered piece. quality isnt top notch but it is excellent for the price
4.0,"Decent sunglasses, smudge easy. Not too tinted."
4.0,"This purse is little. It looks bigger on the outside but inside doesn't have much space. I only had my wallet (just a regular sized wallet), keys, work badge and sunglasses...all of those didn't fit at the same time. It looks super cute thou, sadly I don't see myself using it much."
4.0,One was slightly damaged when it arrived.  One of the chains was completely missing while several others were broken.  I have experience with ewerly like this so repairing it for me was easy.
4.0,"Minor pilling was to be expected, I suppose, since the fabric is a blend. The color is still true one year and many washings later."
4.0,"fine, but wish there was more &#34;wipe&#34; material on the outside and a bit large for my very large hands."
4.0,Took months to get here. Granted covid is disrupting everything right now. I wear these but for only short amounts of time. They make my ears hurt and swell slightly. I generally wear cheap jewelry anyways because I‚Äôm frugal but this is the first that I‚Äôve had cheap jewelry react poorly with my skin.
4.0,No complaints. Fit as expected and the color has held up well through many washings.
4.0,Pretty good for blocking out heavy-footed upstairs neighbor stomping around on hardwood floors -  excellent when used in conjunction with earplugs.
4.0,slit was a little much though - have to wear bike shorts under
4.0,"It's a little bit small, so the words weap around my chest  wish it was a little looser."
4.0,"Bought this for a costume. The strap is pretty cheaply made and seems like it could break easily. A bit expensive for what it is, but still cute."
4.0,a little short but fit well
4.0,"It's a really cute, lightweight sweatshirt. It does run on the more snug side. I wear medium, and ordered a medium. I do like the option to layer, which this does not- so I suggest going up a size. The sleeves are a little too big short to comfortably put my thumbs in the thumb holes."
4.0,Great price and quality! The only issue was it runs a bit big in size.
4.0,"Absolutely adorable! Seems to run a little large, especially in sleeve length and would be great with a zipper instead of snaps (hence 4 stars, not 5). Has held up through multiple washings this season and hoping to get a few more seasons out of it."
4.0,Really nice casual shirt. Would buy again. Held up to multiple washes without shrinking or loosing quality.
4.0,"Im loving the colors and since S, M, L aren't too specific I got a medium. I'll have to lose a little more weight to fit comfortably in this. But I still have room to lose weight so it will be motivation for me"
4.0,"this purse is so pretty.  i got the peach colored one and it's very pretty.  i don't believe it's the best quality, as in, the bones of it feels like it's probably made of heavy cardboard.  but it still looks very nice as a little accent piece.  i'm pretty sure it would not hold up to everyday use, but i switch purses a lot, so it will work well for me."
4.0,"These are really comfortable shoes. I have to wear shoes with decent padding and these definitely make my feet feel good. I've only been buying Merrell and Jambu shoes for the last few years, but wanted something a little nicer without sacrificing comfort.<br /><br />They are a little loose for the size, but nothing too extreme.<br /><br />My only complaint is the Velcro closure on the strap. It will come undone easily if it is not EXACTLY lined up correctly."
4.0,"The fabric is stretchy, like a maxi-dress; this means the stripes may somewhat distort when pulled over a tight area. It wouldn‚Äôt be terrible to buy a size up if you are well endowed. Otherwise, love the pockets, the tie, and the higher neck! Tricky height for wearing necklaces, but such a refreshing style after the gaping, revealing necklines of other clothes."
4.0,"This shirt is so cute -- I love the design and the color. Unfortunately, it's a little too small and I wish I had sized up. It's comfortable, though. Size up and you'll be fine."
4.0,"You get what you pay for & to be fair, I figured I wasn't going to get a vest of high quality for $25<br />(made in China), but I didn't feel like spending twice that. It's bright and will be reflective. Based on reviews I ordered a size larger and it's a bit too big. My normal size medium may have been a bit snug. The neck is a bit tight as there's some elastic there which might be nice if you get caught in the rain. I haven't worn this out biking as yet and that will be the real test."
4.0,"Light weight, easy to put in"
4.0,A little smaller and not as bright as expected but still very pretty.
4.0,They feel nice to touch<br />Color is very nice too<br />Comfortable to wear I‚Äôm up and down a lot<br />Waist didn‚Äôt roll<br />Just smaller than my usual mediums that I wear<br />I would order a size larger
4.0,Great product + a little elbow grease restored a couple pairs of my retro J's I'd hadn't been rocking that I had to put them back in my weekly rotation!
4.0,Kinda smell but they're cute
4.0,Really nice shirt to wear while in uniform. Same color as the ones you can get from clothing sales on base. Not sure on how long these will last and they need to be longer to stay tucked in.
4.0,The fit is good just a little short on the waist! Otherwise i love the shirt!  I guess I should have ordered a size larger!
4.0,The cap is really nice but they didn't glue the stones on very good.
4.0,"Muy c√≥modo, lindo, no le pide nada al de apple..."
4.0,Item was perfect for my daughter!
4.0,"I am 1.67cm and 52 kg and I ordered a Small. It is a little too large for me but the dress quality is good... maybe a little TOO much extra room for me, hahaha"
4.0,"The beads are a little smaller than I expected  (about a quarter inch diameter) but nicely made and light weight/comfortable to wear. The beads are quite intricate and have a matte, brass colored finish. Looks good alone or with other bracelets. Large clasp makes it easy to get on and fit my almost 7 inch wrist with a little room to spare."
4.0,I love these! They‚Äôre so pretty! My only complaint is that they are super big!
4.0,"Gave as a birthday gift. Very pleased  with the rugged quality construction, length of shoulder strap and number of compartments."
4.0,It's small. Get one or two sizes larger if ur tall.
4.0,Nice solid little phone case. Not to bulky. Speedy shipping.
4.0,"gift for my sister, a little thin but super fun."
4.0,"As other reviewers mentioned, these are great for engagement parties or couples showers and also for wedding related outings. They would be fun to wear dress shopping also. Value is good for the number and quality, but some went to waste. We would have loved father of bride and groom buttons, grandparents, flower girl, and maybe some team groom too, rather than multiple hot mess and designated drunk, which we did not use any of. I think the ""funny"" ones should be a separate pack you can buy as an add on if it suits your group."
4.0,"1. Genuine leather and color gives off elegance<br />2. Significantly different from the usual garter suspenders<br />3. I would rather show it off than hide it as undergarment<br />4. Drawback is that the clip is not strong enough to hold its claw to the trousers, its snaps out sometimes<br />5. Get it for yourself if you like to have elegance because of the leather and functionality together"
4.0,"Super cutee but small. My piercings should only fit 2 regular sized heart hoops and I had to fit a 3rd one so it could connect and not flop all over the place. The metal is fine as well, hasnt turned my ear green or anything."
4.0,These high waisted pants have a cool camo pattern The elastic waist has a drawstring. The fabric is fairly lightweight. The interior is not fleece lined. It has a smooth cotton fabric.  There are two side pockets. The ankles taper. They are comfortable and have some stretch.  They look less sloppy than the standard sweat pants. Machine wash and dry.
4.0,cumple con lo ofrecido
4.0,These are super cute. They are great for the price..the quality is decent. I wanted something fun and cute for summer and these are lerfect
4.0,Right foot is tight.
4.0,the slippers are great. but I have trouble with the gripper soles. after I get them worn a bit they will be fine they are well made & feel good on my feet..
4.0,Beautiful sparkle granddaughter loved the shoes but have to return my six year old granddaughter takes a 2 so going on every one review bought true to size  broke my heart when to big  good size to big so I am going down a size  we will see if right size.  MUST SAY  EASY RETURN  GOOD SERVICE
4.0,"Thre robe is very soft and I like the length, we just wish it was a little thicker."
4.0,"Very cozy and warm! And super soft, too. Only downfall is they don‚Äôt stay up very well in the back for me. Otherwise I love them."
4.0,first thing everyone tried on when they got their gifts.  I think I need a 10 pack next year.
4.0,"It did not fit. The shoulders were too big and the bottom was too small, and it would not close. It would probably fit better for taller person with bigger shoulders and smaller waist. It was very pretty, and the material was soft. I had to return it due to the wrong fit."
4.0,Tight fitting. Could not get it slouch right.
4.0,Nothing special about it. Just a plain black t-shirt with the wording that I wanted on it for my son's birthday.
4.0,i like the cork better
4.0,Size 1 is more like a size 3. But they are good quality and my son loves them. He will grow into then!
4.0,"I ordered this band to go with a Casio watch that I also recently bought through Amazon - Casio MDV106-1A. Reviews of the watch recommended replacing the original plastic band with this one to dress up the watch a bit. Looking at the pictures, I was interested, since that watch is basically a replica of the Rolex Submariner, and I felt that it would simply look better with a stainless band. Besides -- for roughly $10, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />The band arrived with the watch. I believe that this is such a common replacement for this watch that it's almost common for them to be ordered together. Why Casio doesn't just ship the watch with a band like this is beyond me - it really changes the look of the watch, making it look much more upscale and expensive than it really is. The original plastic band might actually be more practical for real-life diving, snorkeling and such, but this stainless band has it all for looks.<br /><br />On the downside, try as I might, I was not able to switch the bands myself. I could get the original plastic band off no problem, getting this one on however, proved beyond my meager skills. No trouble - a quick visit to my favorite jewelry store took care of it, and $20 later (to cover replacing the band and adjusting for proper fit), I was a very happy wearer of my new Casio dressed up for a night out.<br /><br />This band feels sturdy, looks like it was made for the watch and fits well once adjusted properly. It is easy to open and locks fairly securely on the wrist. Well worth the $10 to completely transform the solid-but-cheap Casio into a much nicer looking watch."
4.0,I love the fact that the pants fit perfect right out of the package
4.0,It is a hat.
4.0,Please restock these leggings in medium!!! I NEED another pair!!! They are perfect for running/cardio but I will say they are kinda see-through when squatting‚Ä¶ but I just don‚Äôt wear them on leg days üòÖ please restock the black vital 2.0 in medium!!! Lol
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt expect it to be such a thick, almost heavy fabric but as in the title, thankfully it is very stretchy if not very breathable. My daughter is 8, very slender and a bit tall for her age and the size 12 barely fits her‚Äîit really seems to run short."
4.0,Cool sweats. Will shrik in the wash though.
4.0,"Fits good ,I like it ,gonna order another one."
4.0,"These gloves are quite handy...they don't fit real well...but then I have small hands...I like the fact of the long ""sleeve"" part to protect my long sleeve tops. They wash items such as dishes, stainless utensils, cups and glasses rather well...but they are just a little too big; however, if they were snug, that might present a problem. They do have difficulty cleaning residue that is baked on...I had to scrub really hard and then had to use a scrubber after all...but other than that, they function just fine. It'll help out on the hands during the winter!"
4.0,Fit my body really well but came down way past my knee. Was expecting the dress to be shorter.
4.0,The cover has a nice fit and stays in place ( for now).  I am not sure how long it will stay in place after multiple uses.
4.0,"Fit is a little big, in my opinion, which is why it only got 4 stars... Love the cute design of the EKG wave, I have the polka dot ones too and those fit more snugly. I would definitely purchase again because the one thing I do like about them being large fitting is the wide bottom for my toes."
4.0,Just as described. It was a little too big so we returned
4.0,"Made it too heavy,I might get use to it !?"
4.0,"Vibrant color, but I initially had trouble getting it to remain open. I returned the item."
4.0,Just around the house.
4.0,Fits well.Made well.Little expensive.
4.0,"I like jeans a lot. They are high waisted and skinny by the ankles. Material is nice As well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and weigh around 190lbs and got the Lg. The only con I have is that the waist slides down often, and I keep having to pull it up... annoying at times."
4.0,I really like the material it's soft.  I had to cut the sleeves off. Every time I raised my arms it hurt my underarms.  But I still like the night shirt.
4.0,"Great hoodie, good material, well-made, The only complaint I have is it runs one size too small. I ordered a 3Xl and it fits like an athletic 2XL. I ended up giving it to my wife and she loves it."
4.0,"My husband and I both had a pair of these glasses and wore them to an 80s party. The glasses are indeed oversized, yet comfy and cool-looking. I would recommend for an event, such as an 80s party =)"
4.0,"This hoodie is super comfy. It is thinner than anticipated but was perfect for the midwest spring weather this weekend and for running errands/lounging (I actually was trying to figure out how I could get away with wearing this to work today). I'm 5'8, curvy/36DDDD and it was a little loose but exactly how I wanted it to fit. It is long enough to wear with leggings too, so it's basically my idea top! I washed and dried it, expecting it to shrink, but it did not. I would consider buying this in more colors and am very happy with my purchase. Quick shipping/accurate 2-day shipping for Amazon Prime as well.<br /><br />Update: I have worn this several times and put it on right when I get home from work! The negatives: it collects fuzz/dog hair like no other and is kind of shapeless (in the photo it looks like it goes in around the ribs, but it's pretty square in real life). If I were to order again, I would order a size smaller. I ordered up two sizes because of the other reviews advising buyers to go up a size (normally, I would have ordered an XL), but I went up two sizes because I wanted a loose fit. If I were to purchase this again, I would order the 2XL instead of the 3XL."
4.0,Nice Quality fast ship
4.0,"My daughter loves red and thought these shoes were beautiful! They look great, but she says they're uncomfortable after wearing them for more than an hour or two."
4.0,"I wear this under the helmet liner , then a hoodie over that when I‚Äôm ice fishing . It‚Äôs a great layer , the only thing that messes me up with it is that I have a long beard and I have to stretch it down under my chin - no big deal if you‚Äôre not doing that . It still works really well for me and the only 4/5 was because of that . Otherwise I love it ."
4.0,"It's beautifully made. It just didn't fit me the way it looked on the model and I purchased it too large. This is my fault, not the seller's. Beautiful dress though!"
4.0,I just love these things and wear Them outside all the time
4.0,"Really wanted these shorts to work. Liked the fabric,  fit ok, the elastic at the leg seemed OK although I think it will break down kind of fast as it‚Äôs a thin strip. Everything was great except the pad. i‚Äôm not sure who the pad was designed for‚Ä¶ The front and middle is very thin and has these little ditches in them. Not smooth. And then, the back part for your seat bones is immensely thick. I‚Äôve tried a lot of bike shorts and I‚Äôve never seen anything with such thick pads back there. And, the pads go way back up your bottom where it doesn‚Äôt even touch the seat so it‚Äôs like a duck tail. material of  the pad seems nice, but honestly I don‚Äôt know who has a seat that goes that far back. It would definitely catch on the front of the seat if you were mountain biking and off your seat forward and then went to sit back down.<br />Definitely going to return and keep looking. All the other bike liner shorts that I Have and like are now well worn and have been discontinued!- darn!"
4.0,Fit well and is very comfortable. Great buy!
4.0,For the price this is a great top to throw on over a tank top. Fights tight in the sleeves but i like that bec it makes it look less sloppy. If you are looking for something to look cute w jeans go w your normal size but if you're looking to be cozy and wear it w pajamas go a size  up.
4.0,"I like it very much! Thank you.<br />Also, am liking those new light weight fitted tees."
4.0,Good product. Kinda thin. Would recommend still
4.0,I did not want gold colored earrings.  Too much to pay for not getting the product I needed.
4.0,"Matched exactly as shown, I liked this watch a lot.<br />I would give it four star because it‚Äôs difficult to remove watch band links and also there is no instruction given by the maker."
4.0,They look nice but only lasted a few months before my 3 year old broke them.
4.0,"Product nice, felt a little bulky."
4.0,This skirt is beautiful. It fits just as I expected. Long and flowy. In love with it
4.0,these are cool just not what i expected. I wanted a more of a regular jogger these are def for very very cold nights. they are SUPER THICK. i'm a solid 16/18 (closer to 18) and I bought a 2x and they fit perfectly.
4.0,This is a comfortable bra and fits as expected.  It has a nice shape and I like the material. The cups may not be thick enough to cover if it I'm very cold and the material puckers under the arm sometimes. It's not super noticeable but might be something that could be seen if a shirt is really tight.
4.0,Really cute earrings. Reasonably priced and shipped quickly. Will definitely buy more ‚Äúear climbers‚Äù. Took 1 star off because one of the backs was bent all squiggly when I received them.
4.0,"I have several authentic $400++ vlone tees & this one is super close to authentic. The material is good quality but not vlone soft quality. The stitching all lines up nicely, nothing off or specifically cheap about this replica at all. The sizing is really accurate, only about 1"" tighter than authentic. It came in a nice quality zip bag for protection too. Shipping was pretty quick, I'm in California. It was only $30 with good quality and I'm totally ordering more from this seller but size up due to wash shrinkage (it's not preshrunk)"
4.0,Just what I wanted in a good back up pair.
4.0,The pattern is perfect and the colors are what I expected. Its really large and super soft. I cannot wait to wear it! 4 stars because there are imperfections in the hems and that could have been avoided.
4.0,Excellent Christmas present
4.0,Love this bracelet!  It's comfortable on my arm and very stylish. Goes great with a fancy dress or blue jeans.
4.0,"It may not be the most customized jacket for biking.  It does not have any ventilation anywhere.  It is not bright.  The sleeves do not come off.  Thus, it lacks many standard features of more specialized biking jackets.<br /><br />On the positive side, I just tested it in 60 degree weather with some winds.  And, I was surprisingly comfortable.  The lack of physical ventilation was much less of a problem than I expected.  For the material being 100% polyester, it breathes quite a bit more than I expected.<br /><br />Another positive side, is that this jacket does not look like your typical biking jacket.  Let's face it, these egg colored jackets can be pretty ugly.  This one looks downright handsome in comparison.  You could very easily wear it as part of a business casual outfit with kakis and a dress blue shirt, and look pretty smart.  Not bad for a biking jacket."
4.0,"I bought this for two purposes:<br /><br />1) As a way to organize small travel items that I would normally toss loose in my carry-on, and then in the back of an airplane seat: Passport, tickets, phone, earbuds, pen, Kindle, notebook, sleep mask, ear plus.<br /><br />2) To carry around my office so that all my essentials are kept close: phone, pens, highlighters, flash drives, notebook.<br /><br />Have yet to take in on a trip, but it's a handy (and cute) office accessory."
4.0,"Straight out of the box, this fit well and felt very comfortable especially on the inside. After washing, it still fit well but was less comfortable. Some of the softness of the inside material was lost but still fairly comfortable.<br /><br />The fit at the neck is the only issue. It is a little snug. I can see where some people with larger necks would have problems.<br /><br />This hoodie has no style so it is a plain vanilla hoodie. Not bad looking at all. It just gets no style points.<br /><br />This hoodie does provide ample warmth. It is thick enough to keep you warm without being too bulky."
4.0,It‚Äôs an overall good watch nothing against it.. I just thought the gold part was going to be metal not plastic
4.0,It has extremely good color the quality is very good.
4.0,"I was hoping that these shoes would be an easy wear with the elastic. Instead I find I am slipping and sliding out of the front and coming off the back of the heel on the sides. I disappointed and hope that the grips I place inside will help keep my foot in place when wearing the shoes next time.<br /><br />5/15/2017 - Sandalup has shown professional courtesy and emailed me about my displeasure with the product. This is an impressive level of attention to the customer. This pair may not have been the right fit, but with customer service like this, I am more incline to try another style from this company"
4.0,"I bought the ""Black (Skinny Plastic Magnetic Buckle)"" for it to fit through smaller belt loops, and the magnetic aspect of the buckle is only to hold the quick-release buckle closed. The magnet is not what holds the belt tight if you happen to be wearing it at a pie-eating contest and an enlarging middle puts more pressure on the buckle connection as you gobble through more and more pies.<br />If you are used to putting a belt on then cinching it up by pulling the outer part of the webbing that is kind of adjustable (goes through what might be called the ""webbing slot?""), that is not easy to do. You almost have to feed the webbing through, then pull the outside to get it to the right length, then buckle the belt. (Perhaps that ""webbing slot"" will allow easier cinching with time?)"
4.0,"Very happy with the size. my nephews are a 3t, so right now the aprons are a tad big but since this has the adjustable neck strap these can fit them for a while. I got the color I chose unlike some people thinking they received some different then what is shown."
4.0,I have been purchasing these leggings for the past year. Very soft material is comfortable and they come out of the wash good as new. Sizing works for me. The price is so reasonable you should give them a try.
4.0,"Good price for the amount of bows you get.  My only problem was the band is a little big on my average sized 5 month old's head.  Also the Navy blue bow had a black headband, but it wasn't a big deal since I have navy bows already."
4.0,Purchased as a gift. Bag was large and worked well for water aerobics class
4.0,"The dress is great quality but runs a little small. Outstanding service with questions, and shipping!"
4.0,This hat is a little boring but frankly I just saw it and got excited and bought it without a ton of additional thought. It is exactly as pictured!
4.0,"cute top, good price, fit as expected"
4.0,"it's great for the price, and the pattern fits in with the house colors."
4.0,The product appears to be good value.  Glad I ordered a small as the fit is good.  I‚Äôve washed them but haven‚Äôt worn them yet.  They do look comfortable.
4.0,"I'm usually a S, a M when a dress is too tight in the back, but I ordered a L due to being 22 weeks pregnant. If I wasn't I believe a M would have fit just right.. Very nice material, not thin. I'd wear spankx under for a smoother look.. It's a great dress for dressing modestly, I'm 5'3&#34; and it went just under my knees (even with the bump). My husband liked it so much he wants me to order it but in another color!. It's pretty plain so it needed a belt."
4.0,"I like this necklace, it looks a little cheaper than I'd hoped it would.  The chain is too bright, it definitely looks like a costume jewelry chain.  The eye of Horus is colorful and sturdy and the size is nice.  I think it looks good from a distance, as most people looking at it would be.  But as I am wearing it, it does not stand up to my close scrutiny, it looks cheap.  I might buy this again, knowing what I know now.  It's a fun nod to Egypt and an unusual, colorful piece to have in my arsenal, but it doesn't begin to pass as anything other than costume jewelry."
4.0,"Fit is a little large, but I love this tunic."
4.0,"We bought this to hold our passports while on vacation, however they did not fit in the waterproof section.  We did end up using it, and it worked out great if you just need to put cash or a drivers license in the waterproof area. Will fit passports in another section."
4.0,"I was tired of thin, non-cotton socks and wanted to treat myself. These socks delivered.  They are thick, almost all cotton and feel great.  I caught some burrs in them on a hike, so I'll see how they wear having removed the burrs rather indelicately..."
4.0,"I got these to wear my keys for work on - Not incredibly elastic/have a lot of give so they‚Äôre a little tight when you try to wear them. Otherwise, product is as described."
4.0,Very nicely made but it runs small. I usually wear a size 10 or 12 bought an XL and it wouldn't go around my chest. Sent it back and ordered an XXL.
4.0,I didnt like this too much because I thought the material would be more like cotton....but it's kinda cheap material that to me has a oily feel to it. My husband on the other hand LOVES this on me says it is very flattering...and loves the feel of it...
4.0,"Very cute and surprisingly well made for the price. They are WAY bigger than advertised, but most reviews mentioned that so I was expecting it. My daughter is 5 months and I suspect they won't fit her for several months. I ordered the smallest size. If you're not in a rush to receive them then these are a great buy!"
4.0,I have a small head and the back of head strap slides down my neck where it needs to be tight to stay on. It is quite an uncomfortable mask for me but I did buy it to wear while travelling by air in covid time because of the filters. I did not get sick so it must have worked.
4.0,"I ordered this vest in plum, but the color was more of a bright purple, so I returned it and ordered the charcoal color.  It is a nice vest and seemed true to size, so I hope the charcoal will match the dress I'm buying it to match."
4.0,The hat fits great and looks good.  Light and comfortable.  Adjustable crown a plus.  I cut off the stupid looking bow that does not add to the overall design.
4.0,"This dress fits well. I'm 5'11, 200 lbs and the dress goes down to my ankles in a size large. So that should give you some indication of the length of this. Fabric is of good quality, and breathes nicely."
4.0,"Great for the price! My nose had to get a little used to them as it was a little tight and i wasnt quite used to that sensation in my nose, but once i got used to it it was comfortable. I wore it as a halloween costume in my septum!"
4.0,"Nice bands at a decent price. Seller sent wrong size, but still fit, so‚Ä¶"
4.0,"I got the same size I always order but these are a bit tight.. Especially around the ankle area.. Otherwise, seem  to be a good quality."
4.0,"bought this for my 8 year old son and he really liked it. as I expected from previous reviews, there was a strong smell, like  gasoline on the plastic that lasted about a week. also like reviews said, a few of the stones fell off in the first week, but an easy fix with super glue. I was happy that it fit him well enough for his age, plus it will continue to fit if he remains a fan later as he grows."
4.0,very nice easy too put in
4.0,Fits snug in the arms but fine everywhere else
4.0,"Overall, I like this dress. I kept it, and have worn it to a few wedding showers, and to  church. The bright colors on the pattern are VERY vibrant - like the light blue and pink - so it looks a LITTLE cheap; but not bad. Also, the neckline goes a little lower than I anticipated. It‚Äôs very chest-y. Not appropriate for church, that‚Äôs for sure. So I wear a cami underneath it. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to, but it gets the job done. It‚Äôs still cute enough for me to have kept it, so I‚Äôd recommend!"
4.0,"The band itself is really nice, pretty easy to change sizing, and the blue looks amazing. The only con is it scratches easily and I don't even use it that often while stuck at home. Still a thumbs up though on quality of the material."
4.0,"Overall these are some lightweight and good-looking sunglasses, but they do have their quirks. I had one of those polarizer test sheets laying around to test the polarization and these are polarized. The lenses are clear and free of significant distortion along the edges and the lens opacity is extra dark for those very bright, sunny days. With that comes too dark of a lens when the sun isn't out. The only thing I don't like is the cheap hinges that'll most likely need to be tightened down constantly because hinges like the one on these glasses like to loosen up with minimal use. They're about as comfortable as your average glasses and since it's plastic-nose contact be prepared to wipe your nose and glasses at least twice throughout the day if you're wearing them all day or else they'll ride down and slip from the oil buildup."
4.0,"Let me start off by saying I put this bracelet on my casio mdv106 . At first, there will be a lot of wiggle at the end links because you must fit this bracelet to your watch by bending and adjusting it. After about 30 minutes, I got it nearly perfect with no wobble and very small gap between the end link and the case. It is high quality and very comfortable. My only complaint is that mine came with a small imperfection, almost like a nick in one of the links. Its not noticeable though so it doesn't really bother me too much."
4.0,"I needed something festive to wear to the senior care center for Xmas caroling. So I added battery operated lights, and garland to the dress. Oh My the folks loved it!! Went to lunch with the church members later, and the same reaction at the restaurant."
4.0,I loved this item but it was too small. I should have purchased an XL but it wasn‚Äôt available at the time. Very nice sweater though. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äô‚Äô 150 lbs 36 B
4.0,I have XL and XXL fit the same
4.0,had a chemical stink at first. It went away after airing it out a couple of days. Good buy
4.0,"I bought this for my son who is between an XL and an XXL in boys. I bought the size small because men's small usually fit him well. This is kind of snug and much shorter than any other men's small shirt I've ever bought him. He loves it so I'm going to let him keep it but if you have a long torso or are an actual adult, I'd suggest going up a size."
4.0,"Bought these in the hopes of making one of them the top to my vintage jewelry Christmas tree, but they are very small - MUCH smaller than the description says.  Oh well, they will make beautiful, tho very small ""ornaments"" on the tree.  As earrings they would probably be perfect for a lady who wanted something beautiful and dainty.  They are very nicely made."
4.0,I used these on a long flight. I love the color. They were a little tighter than I would have liked.
4.0,"I cannot wait to wear this on my vacation.  Nice material, color pictured as shown. Picked my size based on reviews, I'm 5'3 200 lbs.  The romper comes slightly higher on me compared to the model, probably because of my short torso, nothing the adjustable straps won't fix."
4.0,I bought 3 of them 1 for me and 2 are gifts. So adorable but it's hot on the face.
4.0,"Fits great, took the cups out of top because they were a weird round shape. Overall, I love it!"
4.0,These are more of a junior cut than a women‚Äôs so order a size up if you want them baggy. I ordered another pair
4.0,"Run a little small. Very warm and comfy, but will make you look very fluffy."
4.0,"I did really like these jeans, they fit perfectly For my size(27/5) great quality and loved the button detail, however, the legs were so tight around the knee it was uncomfortable to wear and I had to return them. Would have gotten a bigger size but the were out of stock. Length was around 33‚Äù"
4.0,Lovely but the material is a little cheap
4.0,"Definitely looks just like the picture!! Only problem is that it runs a little large, order down a size!!"
4.0,"it is huge, really catches the eye, fun to wear<br />I hate having to put required amount of words... stupid<br />I would rate more without it"
4.0,This cover up is very comfortable made of soft material. It fit as expected. I am 5'9&#34; with long arms. I ordered a large and the arms fit well and the cover fell right below my buttocks in back. The only minus is that the material  frays a little after a couple washes.
4.0,"I love this shirt but I think I could have sized down.  I am a US Medium and I run larger in the chest with broad shoulders.  The size chart suggested XL which is typical for me on Amazon but I think I could have definitely used a L or maybe even a M.  There is another size chart with the product pictures that is probably more accurate.  Still, it is very flattering and nice for work.  I am going to get the blue in M this time."
4.0,"Honestly, the case started melting off in the heat when I got some sunscreen on it. It is starting to fade out and peel already, also part of the case broke off.  I would say it was worth buying because it was so cheap but DO NOT expect it to last a long time. It is more of a fashion case than anything. If you need something that is durable do NOT buy this. It is a cute design though so I would purchase  again once this one breaks for sure."
4.0,They work well and are comfortable to wear. Well made.
4.0,"The shoes are really good to keep infants and toddlers from kicking them off, have a great-barefoot feel,and does not cramp the feet."
4.0,Beautiful dress but size up because it runs tight in the stomach and hip area
4.0,"This dress is amazingly comfortable! The only downfall is the material is to thin. You can see through it. I was going to return it until I felt how comfortable it was on.. So I will keep it to wear around the house, as a swim suit cover up, or when the weather is a bit cool I have a sweater that I can wear with it. If the material was not so transparent, it would be perfect! It is amazingly comfortable and fit as I was expecting it too."
4.0,Good quality except they can get a little rough around the crotch seams after a few washes
4.0,will have to charge every two days. My daughter loves them
4.0,"The shirt is very cute and comfortable. It fits perfectly. I love the buffalo plaid sleeves, and the holiday images."
4.0,"I am a 34D, so I usually fill out most tops. I got a Medium, but I probably needed a Small - it is a bit big in the chest area but I will just do some creative stuffing :)"
4.0,It's a very warm hoodie.  I love the hood bc it covers your entire face and shields from the wind.  I'm usually a medium but ordered an xl based on other reviews and it fits like a medium so if you want a baggy fit order 3-4 sizes up!!!!
4.0,Nicely made.  The elastic band was a bit small so I had to use rolled tissue under the mask to bring if away from my face.
4.0,Nice scarf but too much fabric for me. I had my tailor split it in half lengthwise and now it‚Äôs great.
4.0,Great look and feel. They were a tad small. The burgundy one will bleed when you (or your husband) washes it the 1st time.
4.0,"Nice dress.  Definitely did not hit at the calf like in the pictures, however.  It is a full length maxi dress. I actually have to wear heels with this dress or it drags on the ground. Material is thin,  but not sheer, which I like.  Waist and arm holes fit as expected."
4.0,"Mine was very cute and was very comfy and got a lot of compliments. Mine came with a hole though, easily hidden, but still."
4.0,"Cute, fits well, and was able to accommodate my rapidly changing body. I wore it from 20 weeks of pregnancy to full term. The only complaint is that the fabric pilled quite quickly after just a few washes even though I put it in a mesh bag during the wash."
4.0,"The color is awesome, but the gown is a little short and tight but usable. Should have a better length. The robe is ok."
4.0,the  pipings are nice with the mask images and everything but zippers are so hard even for adults to zip up
4.0,"I like it. Light weight for packing. Coverage for arms, which I was looking for. But I wish it was offered in larger sizes, I would have gone up one more size for my tall big frame."
4.0,"Overall I like this product.<br />It's smaller than I thought from the pics and description. Its about 5"" long and 1.5"" wide. However, that's fine, it fits around the brim of a felt hat.<br />The biggest drawback is that the bristles are very medium stiffness. It doesn't clean/brush all the particles off the hat very easily. Would like to see a little but stiffer bristles.<br />It's a keeper and I'll use it."
4.0,I love this dress it fits really nicely. Its a little long for my taste but I'm just going to bring it in and get it taken up! I purchased a large and I'm a size 12 and its very true to size!
4.0,"Love this dress. Theres a button on it that seems a bit high. Definitely couldn't fit my boobs in it, but i easily removed the buttons and love it. If you dont want to have to do this I'd say go a size up but I love everything else about it. Im 5'3"" 135 pounds and wear a C and ordered a medium."
4.0,Cute but slippery on smooth hair. I think they'll be difficult to keep in place during a run.
4.0,Bottom of socks is hard on feet too thin
4.0,"I wore these on my flight to NYC.  They are comfortable. However, they are a little more on the thinner side of material as far as corduroy is concerned.  I am hoping that they will hold up to multiple washings."
4.0,Granddaughter very satisfied.
4.0,Sexy but somewhat tight fitting
4.0,Would have been 5 stars but received only the jacket without the belt.
4.0,"I get lots of compliments on this watch. Assuming it lasts a while, I would buy it again."
4.0,I was quite pleasantly surprised when I tried on this suit. I have always needed a longer suit and had to pay more to get one. But this suit is quite adequate and it feels just fine even though it is a regular length suit. Lands End still does a good job with suits.
4.0,LOVE THESE JAMMIES !!!
4.0,"The onesie is amazing, however, sadly the sock already has while a giant hole on the side. My 11 year old daughter loved it! I bought an xs size and it fits just right."
4.0,Pretty thin material but ok for price
4.0,"I got these to use during the day as a compression sleeve for an elbow injury. I use a stronger medical compression sleeve at night and when I'm actively using my affected arm. Wearing these sleeves at other times help me to remember to observe the weight limits that will help my injury heal, without weakening the muscles. This is not medical advice! Just sharing what helps me."
4.0,I love this necklace!! It's exactly what I thought it would be. The only thing I'm not sure I like is the clasp. It is like a button type clasp. Hoping it stays put but overall...LOVE this buy!!!
4.0,Overall decent quality considering the price. Cute for a vacation bag. I like that it zips close!
4.0,I like design bur fabric is too thick.
4.0,i love this sweatshirt!!! it seems to run a tad small. I got a XL and it was a bit tight  but fit fairly well otherwise.
4.0,Fit is huge.  Suggest ordering smaller size.
4.0,"Very stylish watch, but I've received the item with cracked front glass :("
4.0,Love this sweater! It‚Äôs very soft and cozy and I especially like the fact that the mock turtleneck is not too tight. Definitely size down since it runs very large.
4.0,I loved so beautiful üíú
4.0,"Look, I paid $5 a pair for these. You get what you paid for most often and these are actually quite good for $5. I don't expect them the last long but at $5 they don't need to. They are comfortable enough for it as much as a 3-hour ride seated the whole time. I would say the only problem I have is that occasionally you have to stand up on your pedals and pull them down a little bit. There's no silicone grip at the bottom of the legs so they do ride up a little at times. Otherwise I forgive extremely good bang for the buck."
4.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful example of a shark mesh watchband. The links are heavy-duty, and highly polished. The deployment clasp is solid stainless steel, with a double push-button release, and has an overlapping safety latch. It's about as solid an arrangement as I've ever seen on a watchband. Once this thing is on your wrist, it's not going anywhere, believe me. In addition, the J.Vander logo on the clasp features a ship's wheel design, in keeping with the nautical aspect of any dive watch you attach it to. All in all, it looks fabulous on the wrist, and enhances the look of any watch.<br /><br />So why only four stars?<br /><br />Well, if the band needs sizing, (and it probably will!) its a bit of a pain to do. There are instructions on the J.Vander website. They make the process sound simple enough, which I daresay it would be if you own a Dremel tool. I don't. But I do have good small wire cutters, and needle-nosed pliers, and, most importantly, I am blessed with patience.<br /><br />If you don't own a Dremel tool, patience is the key. The potential to mess up, and ruin the band, is great. It would be all too easy to scratch, mar, or mangle the band. Links should be removed a row at a time, checking on the sizing as you go, alternating sides so that the clasp will stay central on the underside of your wrist. Each row is one single steel wire strand, interwoven with the next row. So, as you unravel each row you must be careful not to damage the next.. I found it best to unwind one 'link ' at a time, cut off the unwound portion, and then repeat the process, until the whole row was removed. (Incidentally, I recommend removing links from the clasp ends of the band, so that, if you do any damage, it will be hidden by the clasp.)<br /><br />All of this is painstaking and time-consuming work. BUT, the final result is well worth the effort, in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course, if you have huge wrists none of the above applies, but I had to remove five rows of links, and I have 8 inch wrists."
4.0,Cute well made hat. Fabric has weight. Design is reminiscent of the 20's era. Photo doesn't show that. Not exactly what I would have picked after trying on. But nice product. I kept it. It is a great hat to pack and the wool blend is warm with style. I may take off the flower. In my opinion it is for a younger person.  It seems somewhat small in size.
4.0,"It fit more like a 12 slim, which is fantastic for my son but should be noted."
4.0,"I ordered this in the green. Online, it looks a bit different.  There was no option for an extra small (which I think the model is wearing), so I purchased a Small, and it's still a bit large for my usual sizing.  Still cute, and material fine--one complaint was that it came super wrinkled. I will definitely need to iron it before wearing."
4.0,"I have large hands for a woman, so these are a bit snug right now, but I love the coverage of the fingers on a cold day.  The gloves are kind of jazzy in appearance.  The odd smell took a while to air out before I wanted to wear the gloves, though.  The are a good value, but their pattern for the thumbs needs some tapering for women's fingers."
4.0,Fits well.  My daughter is a 38C and the XL fits good
4.0,Pleasing....
4.0,"I followed the chart and bought a S and it is still too big. I will have to get the taylor to make an alteration. I have 34in bust, 27in waist and 37in hips. I'm 120lbs and stand at 5ft 7in. I always wear small but this time, the small was too big."
4.0,Much bigger than expected  very pretty
4.0,I purchased these at a reduced cost for an honest review.<br />My mom has limited sensitive vision. She can not gat shampoo in her eyes nor can she wear tight rings around her eyes. She tried these as soon as they came this morning and they were great. She has to get used to them but we think they will work well.
4.0,"I really like these shorts.  Has a little stretch so they are not tight at all, I ordred a smaller size and they fit very good."
4.0,These tops are very short. I wasn't expecting that at all. I like my tank tops to go down to my hips but these are about an inch of two above
4.0,"The material is very static-y and so far pretty clingy. I'm hoping that when summer comes the dry air won't cause so much static on this product. Outside of that, the material is really comfy, stretchier than I thought it would be, but the fit is very flattering! The cutouts are super cute and the length is PERFECT! Sexy. Comfy. What more could you ask for?"
4.0,"This is a fun and unique hat. The hat is extremely well made and feels very tough, and has lots of little manufacturing details that make it nice.<br /><br />I would point out to everyone, I will probably not wear this hat much, I thought it was cloth or wool when I purchased, but it is like a leather or plastic blend, it would be great for rain. But it takes a certain style to be able to pull off a shiny leather looking hat, and my style just does not fit that."
4.0,The waist fits perfectly but the legs are a little snug on my muscular legs.
4.0,"not sure how they will wear over time, but happy so far"
4.0,"Super cute, but runs large! I'm 5'8&#34; 120lbs and the small is pretty baggy on me"
4.0,"Esta muy bonita,, solo que necesita mas bien pegada"
4.0,"This is a nice necklace, the only part I didn't like was how large the clasps was. Other than that, awesome quality."
4.0,"I love the strap! It's far more durable than the original strap. The only reason that I gave 4 stars is because I ordered silver, and received gold. I still love it though."
4.0,"I bought this dress for an outdoor Springtime family photo session.<br /><br />When I received the package, it didn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôd be much. It was VERY wrinkled, but it ironed out fairly easily with steam. The amount of material and the pattern make ironing tricky, but that‚Äôs fine for me.<br /><br />I‚Äôm a size 4 with a 36DD bust and the Small was too big. I could have easily gotten away with wearing an XS, but I think it photographed OK anyway. With the too-stretchy waistband and gathering at the waist, this dress would be a lovely maternity dress.<br /><br />I loved the comfort of this dress and the pattern was really beautiful in photos. I‚Äôm waiting to order more dresses till after I launder this one to see how it does."
4.0,Love this dress so much ! It is very flattering !
4.0,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call them small as the lenses drop down quite low on my face.  But I also have chubby cheeks so who knows?  Works great for fishing (can really see them in the water) and regular wear.
4.0,"Definitely would not call this red.  But color aside, it appears to be the perfect purse.  Unless you want fuchsia though, go with the brown or black."
4.0,Reallyly liked this hat. It's a little loose on me. Thankfully it has adjustable straps on the back which makes it more snug. It's very nice and comfortable.<br /><br />***rec'd at discounted price in exchange for honest review***
4.0,It fits as expected. I like my shirts huge so i try to buy larger sizes. The only reason i give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the color is just slightly off on the shirt i received compared to the picture shown it's slightly bluer and made up of tiny dots instead of smooth. It's still pretty and i still love it just the color isn't as shown.
4.0,"Fits perfect and my daughter LOVES It!  Took a while to get here and did not arrive on time from Christmas, but was well worth the wait."
4.0,"Comfortable set but without tucking in the shirt is quite frumpy. Looks more fitted in the photos. Was expecting a cuter, more exaggerated off the shoulder look, but found this to be a boat neck style at best. Not bad, just was not what I though it would be."
4.0,"Perfect for the price. 2 of them were damaged but it's okay for the price, still got 10 perfect ones<br />Perfect size for sunglasses"
4.0,I didn‚Äôt realize this was only for 1 pair.<br /><br />Socks are fine. They feel thick and sturdy. They hug my calves and feel like they do what they promise.
4.0,I am impressed by this bag for the price. The bag seems well made and sturdy. I will be putting it through a test next week on two business trips.
4.0,It has a weird cut skinny and long. But my son still loves it.
4.0,This is great I am using it for dancing and as a Canaanite in a musical.  Makes it easy to dance for the play.  I am enjoying it until I have to try to climb a ramp.  They are going to make it more rough on the ramp because I am not the only one.  However my sandals seem much better quality to others that are in the same scene.  Mine is also a lot more comfortable to wear as well.
4.0,Love the feel but I hate that you can see the pocket outline so much. Also they fit me like a full length legging
4.0,"I needed these glasses as a 60's/70's fashion accessory and I like the look of them! The fit is a little iffy on me- the silver metal piece in the middle rests on my nose despite the nose pieces (part of the white lens rims), but I suppose that's my nose's problem and not the glasses. I'm not sure how long they will hold up given that they were pretty cheap but I appreciated that they included some nice extras like the magnetic hard case and cleaning cloth."
4.0,"Small, Beautiful."
4.0,"They're warm, they're thick, and they look like your skin. I got the thicker fleece-lined ones so when I wear these my legs look much thicker than normal and if that's not an issue for you then, by all means, this is a great product."
4.0,"It did snatch in those bat wings, I‚Äôll give it that. But it also turned me into a rocket ready for take off. It was way to pointy for me. Reminded me of the 1950‚Äôs when pointy rockets chests were in style.<br /><br />It ran very small. Too small.<br /><br />Material quality was great. Pricing is on point with what I‚Äôd expect to pay."
4.0,"Probably the nicest looking medical bracelet I've seen, however, they need a better way to keep it on. The ""buckle"" stoppers always slide over and then the ""buckle"" piece slips out and the bracelet falls off. I've had it fall off while I was getting ready for bed and also while I was doing the dishes. Not good if you're in a car accident and want this bracelet to remain on your wrist for the EMTs to see. If it had a more sturdy clasp, it would be perfect. Looks a lot like a watch until you get up close."
4.0,Hi Have had it on for about 4 days I am going to have to have it cut off I can‚Äôt get it to unclose
4.0,I just got it and am happy that it fits and looks good. The install was simple and fast. The band came with the specific screwdriver and screws.  I give it 4 stars because I don‚Äôt know yet if I‚Äôll run into any issues later. I just noticed it catches hair on the arm so when I try to adjust the band so hairy arms beware.
4.0,Alittle tight for bigger girls.
4.0,My daughter liked it but I felt the adjuster on the strap was a little cheaply made.
4.0,"The quality is good.  I wear Yoga pants and active wear daily.  The waist runs big and I find them to be extra long.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 145 lbs.  My legs are thin and these are snug on my legs.  My weight tends to be more in my belly area and butt.  I wear long tops..  I read the reviews, there are many.  Based on the reviews I decided to get the Medium.  I'm glad I did.  I would buy them again.  I haven't washed them yet.  Will report back when I do."
4.0,Had to order three times to get one that fit. They are very nicely embroided and I have received compliments when wearing them.
4.0,These are pretty good for the cost. They rattle a little bit but haven‚Äôt fell out of the frames. Been wearing them for three months daily
4.0,"Really unusual bag. You won‚Äôt see a zillion women carrying it. Nice and roomy, with a couple of inside pockets. Quality for the money, I love it"
4.0,I bought these as a gift for my Daughter-in-law for Christmas.  They look to be the correct size & seem very well made.  The look exactly as pictured. She is a huge Deadpool fan & I am sure she will love them.
4.0,Looks and Feels great.
4.0,Cute dress. I usually wear a 1x but ordered a xl. Should have ordered a lg. The back was also longer than the front. Kept it because it's comfortable.
4.0,Good jacket a little stiff abs zippers get stuck
4.0,"The stitching on the neck is noticeable and itchy, but the shirt has held up very well after multiple washes. It is long enough to wear with leggings (I am 5‚Äô7) and it is loose fitting so I didn‚Äôt have to order a size up for it to fit. I didn‚Äôt not find the chest to be loose like other reviewers, but I do have wider shoulders. I wear a strapless bra because it does sit wide on my shoulders."
4.0,Only received 11.  Product description says 12
4.0,Boots are very comfortable. Boots tube longer is better.
4.0,Great color and works as a great head band.
4.0,A little lighter in color than shown. Still a nice watch though
4.0,I love that it's light and flowy but the left strap broke the same day I got it so that's a little irritating.<br />Other than that it came as expected
4.0,"This is a very bright and colorful dress. It is very comfortable with adjustable straps. It is not see through thank god! Lol! The only issue is that if you are 5'3 like me, the length is gonna get ya. It is a very long dress. I ended up wearing my high heeled  wedges with it and it was still long. I could see the tips of my shoes. When I just have on flats I tie the dress in a knot at the bottom. Otherwise I would have to hold my dress up to walk. So I would suggest that short ladies hem it, tie it, or wear heels. Other than that, it is a pretty dress that doesn't cling to every bump and lump. (For thick ladies like me) I would recommend this dress."
4.0,"I‚Äôm in love with the skirt, although the waistband arrived folded up and it won‚Äôt lay flat. Otherwise everything is great."
4.0,"I like the sleeves, they stretch to fit. My job has me working out doors in the sun, not indoors,<br />They keep the sun off, better than using chemicals that get absorbed into your skin."
4.0,This thing works great for your cards. I don't use it for my folding money as I don't care for that part of it.  The slide out plastic window holds my not so important cards.  I use that part for punch cards and paper type cards that are not important. I do love the credit card dispenser.  Really slick how it stacks the cards so you can pick the one you want.
4.0,"I liked the mask, but stays folded when first put on, you must pull up and down at same time, but this is normal enough. good alternative to KN95S"
4.0,The band seems very comfortable and the lock into the fitbit seems sturdy.  I can't rate it on durability as yet as I've only worn it for a couple of weeks.  It is a nice looking alternative to the siliconish black band that my fitbit came with that I didn't find attractive or very comfortable.  This band is casual looking if that matters to you.
4.0,"This is a great hat, but was quite large on me...but I have a small head.  Just beware if you have a small head that this hat runs for regular size heads I guess."
4.0,"Again, this is a very comfortable nightgown.  A bit large (size large) but nice cotton material; launders very well."
4.0,"As stated in the headline, it is cheap.  The key response is as you would expect from any basic non-mechanical keyboard.  The keys are soft and obviously dome based with okay response.  The backlighting is excellent even if it is only 1 color.  The volume control works perfectly.  The only downside is that it is not spill proof, but it doesn't claim to be.  Actually, I would add another downside in that you can no longer buy it on Amazon without the unnecessary mouse.  If you want a cheap, replaceable combo this is a good buy.  As a former gamer who grew up and no longer has the time to dedicate to games, this would be good for beginners.  If you blame your hardware for your failings then it is not the hardware, but the gamer.  I can say that as an OG and the fact that on occasion I still use this cheap keyboard to ruin the fun of newbs and experienced gamer's alike. :)  It is quite good for writing papers as a university student, or articles as a journalist in the middle of the night that require pages upon pages of information as it has low hand fatigue.  I am on my second one as I wore out my first and I like it.  This is just my personal opinion so take it as that.  I hope others appreciate it for what it is and what it isn't."
4.0,"very pretty earrings, good quality. only issues i would say is they are heavy and they are bigger then i expected,"
4.0,I think this is a fun piece for cosplay the cloud doesn't look it does exactly from the show but it's a fun piece and fit as expected I wear a medium and that's what I ordered.
4.0,"This is a pretty dress. It was too tight around the middle for me, but if your tummy is flat you might really love the dress."
4.0,"It is sooooooooooo warm. The sleeves are a little &#34;snug&#34; , but very warm. The pattern is so beautiful. I would certainly recommend this for everyone. It is so nice; not too heavy."
4.0,It's beautiful.  It looks just like the picture.  Colors are vibrant.  I wish the straps were bigger. They are spaghetti strapped. Like most spaghetti straps... they tend to dig into you. I only wear it while I a. Washing dishes or cooking. I do love the appron. I get a lot of compliments. I just don't want to mess it  up while cleaning.  You love it. I found the same image as a canvas picture.  I look it too.
4.0,Product was just the right size for the craft I used it for and was very sturdy.
4.0,"I love my Bobo Bird Watches. I have 3 of them. They make for good gifts too. Obviously not the quality that Original Grain watches are, but they work for me. I own several different watches so these don‚Äôt get worn daily so they don‚Äôt take the beating that an everyday watch would, so it works for me!"
4.0,These look different than traditional ugg boots.  They seem to fit and look a little larger than I expected.  But they are warm and have better traction
4.0,"Love this look, just need an additional safety loop for closure."
4.0,Great light sock! I wear a size 7 US men‚Äôs shoe fit perfect after a wash. Usually the gender neutral adult character socks fit big these were great now to buy the rest of them! Just wish they were cheaper that is the only reason I don‚Äôt give it 5 stars.
4.0,"I was excited to get this to go with my silk kimono, but it does not fit! I am a size 18, but I could not get it to cross over my chest properly, nor could I cross the straps in the back and then tie it in the front. I am disappointed, as the material feels nice and I was hoping to be able to wear my kimono properly."
4.0,I like this dress but I don‚Äôt like the sleeves.  The arm of the sleeve doesn‚Äôt stretch very well.  The bust is super flattering and makes my boobs look way bigger than they actually are LOL.  Material is stretchy but also a little cheap looking.
4.0,Only complaint isnt a bad thing. Wish they were a little thicker cause its winter. She said they fit nice and loves the moon phases.
4.0,"The purse is much bigger than I expected.  I get into a fight with the interior purse ... so I'll toss it out for a while then, bring it back.  This is one of only two purses I have purchased in recent years.  I was carrying a purse I purchased in 1997 from Mervyn's up until a few years ago.  The interior purse creates compartments.  It is well made.  I tightened up the straps on the sides in order to lessen the width of the excess outer purse bottom ('the corners').  There is a hard-bottom sewn under the liner of the large purse.  If I use the longest strap, I tuck the handles inside the purse so they don't get caught on anything.  I like the color, which is even throughout the purses.  Rivets are holding up very nicely, no wear so far.  I've had the purse for a while now and it gets tossed around a bit without showing wear and tear.  I like using the longest strap over one shoulder with the purse on the opposite side.  Comfortable for carrying that way, or even placing the handles over the shoulder.  I forget and let the long strap hang, so it catches on things.  It holds a LOT of stuff.  I have extra keys attached to the rings of the straps inside the purse.  I can put my water jug as well as odds and ends in it, which frees up my hands when necessary.  I just need to win the battle with the organization of the purses!  Probably simply because I carried that one purse for SO many years."
4.0,"I decided to get the dress to wear for church for St. Patrick Day, and I was a little skeptical about buying this as I didn't know what size to get, so I decided to buy an XL, and it fits perfectly !!! My only problem with this dress is that you can see my bra in the back, but that can easily be fixed with a jacket; I will be buying more for the summer.<br /><br />When I first opened the dress it looked really short, but when I put it on it went past my knee.  For reference I'm 5'2 and 240 lbs."
4.0,Looks and works great. However there are only two size settings for mounting the watches in the winder. Not a huge deal but my watch fits a bit loose and moves while in winding mode.
4.0,good belt. thanks
4.0,"These were a great gift for my mother, she absolutely loved them, and didn't even know how cheap they were in all reality."
4.0,"Wine glass not as nice as in picture  but is still a very nice charm, maybe the stem could be a different color the white looks a little weird"
4.0,Would have preferred it a bit smaller. Seem xtra wide!
4.0,The inside sole had fallen out of one shoe.
4.0,"These are absolutely fun! They are lightweight, don't pull on my ears, colorful, dangly, and did not cause any allergic reaction. I like the size... nice statement earrings, but not so big that they become bothersome. The downfall is the price for these... they are overpriced to comparable earrings with the same, look, and feel."
4.0,"Curren watches offer great quality at an extremely affordable price. This watch is kind of bulky, as many other styles and brands are nowadays, but it has great looks and good qualities. If the case size is important, be aware that a lot of the Curren watch models run large, like in the 45mm range.  When selecting a different type of watch, like Chronograph, make sure that you read the description carefully so you do not end up selecting a watch with fake dials and push buttons, unless you don't mind that sort of thing. Curren watches offer very good quality overall for the price range, but in some cases, mainly in the very low priced range, just read the descriptions carefully. Spending a few more dollars can provide you much better results. This is a good product overall."
4.0,Machine washed beautifully
4.0,Worked fine until you go outside to grab mail. Moisture comes up through the soles even though made of rubber. Obviously porous rubber.
4.0,I would give five stars if the ring that holds the key to the bird was stronger.  I do love the style and have had people comment on how cute they look on my wall.
4.0,Great quality tank-top (especially for the price) but the sizing chart is a little off. The material doesn‚Äôt shrink much but I ordered a SM based on the provided size chart and I should have gotten a medium. My biggest issue is the short length because it come up too easily when I am working out.
4.0,I will have to wait and see how it works out.  I am returning because the zipper would not lock.  I hope to reorder.
4.0,"Used this for a bad guy in a church play. Not realistic, but great for a comedy villain. Held up through two performances and are still usable."
4.0,"Quality is good, fits as expected. As yet untested in the field.Purchased as a tropical bush hat."
4.0,Starting to turn yellow gold. Kept away from all other jewelry.. but I only wear white gold.
4.0,Was satisfied with item.
4.0,"Good boots for a season, just to slip on for every day wear. Kind of flimsy, but decent for the price."
4.0,"Measurements were accurate and dress is as described. We ordered the dress in purple- just had to adjust the straps a little. Otherwise, it was perfect for a formal occasion."
4.0,These fit nicely over my glasses.  I like them.
4.0,"I want to like these, but quite honestly I‚Äôm a bit nervous to wear these out to the gym. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 28 waist and 34 hips. Size 6 pants small leggings. I ordered my normal size small. I feel like they fit a bit big through the waist and hips. I know they‚Äôre joggers, but I feel like compared to how the legs fit the hips should be less baggy. The material is like yoga or athletic leggings, comfy and buttery to the touch. They fit alright, but I think it‚Äôs the color that‚Äôs throwing me off. I love the color itself, but because it‚Äôs so light it‚Äôs not very forgiving and shows my lumps and bumps on the backside. And that‚Äôs in my dim bedroom light. Maybe I‚Äôll try them jogging outside  or on an upper body gym day if Ifs not crowded... but I think I should have ordered a darker color because of my backside imperfections."
4.0,Very nice bright bracelet...... The only problem I had was the 6 plus weeks to arrive
4.0,"These glasses haven't been worn a lot yet, but I think they will hold up well. I was expecting them to be a bit more &#34;bendy&#34; because I do feel like they could break. Definitely better than most cheaper sunglasses for kids though!"
4.0,Love the black and white paws
4.0,"The material is real silk, but it is pretty close to my head, so if you have a lot of hair, it may not be big enough."
4.0,Great bag. I‚Äôve used it to travel a few times. It rolls up tight enough to strap to the side of my carry-on backpack. My only issue is that I can‚Äôt seem to roll it up as neatly as I‚Äôd like to. Not a deal breaker but I‚Äôd like it to look like the pics on this product page when rolled up. I just can‚Äôt seem to figure that part out.
4.0,"Love the fabric, a little long, had them tailored, very comfortable."
4.0,"For the price I couldn‚Äôt pass it up. I wear a 7 5/8 hat, good fit and very warm even though it‚Äôs faux fur.  Like the mask feature."
4.0,Neoprene is heavy duty.
4.0,"These gloves are good for a 100k ride and not much further than that in one workout session. I found the gel padding on the palms to be nice at first and after a few hours for biking, friction is bound to heat up the gel inserts.<br />I should‚Äôve gotten the xl pair instead of the lg pair too. But if you want to buy affordable gloves that can keep your wrists feeling good after a long bike ride, get these"
4.0,It's smaller in the band than the last wacoal bra I purchased. They could be different styles which can cause that.
4.0,"Very pretty, great size, and I received quite a few compliments"
4.0,It‚Äôs kind of hard to tell since I bought them for my grandson and he‚Äôs only used them once<br />But look good fit great<br />Appear durable
4.0,Very comfortable<br />i have this bra in 3 colors
4.0,"This is a stylish and useful clutch.  It won't hold much more than a small wallet, cell phone, and keys, but that's what it's designed for.  It fits easily into a larger bag, and of course matches larger Chelsey Henry totes, but lets you carry the essentials when you pop out for a quick coffee or lunch. As with other Chelsey Henry products, it is a nice blend of style and function."
4.0,Great quality. Only draw back is you have to unzip a bit to use the buttons to lock and unlock
4.0,When they arrived it was not the color. that I ordered but they're okay.
4.0,"Beautiful quality made beads.  Love the look, only complaints are the tassels to tighten are a bit long and get it the way and they aren't really ones that you can just keep on all the time because they're a bit noisey.  Trivial complaints"
4.0,i like using this product when I remember them in my car.  i feel as though i am helping the environmet
4.0,Great watch illumination is not as bright as pictured that's the reason for the four stars
4.0,Fit great and daughter loves them.
4.0,It is so nice and I love it but it is way bigger then I thought it was going to be. But all and all I would buy it again and recommend others to as well
4.0,"Overall, I liked the quality of the dresses. However, I bought these for my bridesmaids dresses and every dress fit each girl differently, even girls who got the same size. A couple of my girls ordered a large and one of the dresses hit about 2 inches below the knee while the other large hit 4 inches ABOVE the knee. Then, I had two girls order a small. One of the smalls hit a couple inches below the knee while the other went all the way to the ankles.<br />Really cute dress for individual wear, but don't buy them for your bridesmaids unless you want to constantly be sending dresses back. I like the dresses, just not the hassle that came with them."
4.0,"Really pretty and well made earrings-- shimmery gold without appearing overly shiny and cheap.  Be aware before you buy that they are pretty big (at least 3 inches long, I don't have them with me to measure), and fairly heavy on your earlobes. If you like that, go for it! But if you like your earrings to be more subtle, or don't like the slight pulling sensation that comes with wearing a heavier pair, these might not be the ones for you. Personally I think they look great with your hair up in a bun and minimal other jewelry-- they are definitely *statement earrings.*"
4.0,Great little tote that my daughter uses to carry her art supplies.
4.0,"These aren't as pretty in person compared to the pictures, to me."
4.0,Ordered 13-24 months smidge big on my daughter. She wears 24-2t. Any smaller would of been to small. So was good. No chemical smell on mine.
4.0,It looks great on my daughter. She was a bit uncomfortable because it was a little see through.
4.0,"Super cute light-up rings used as prizes for a game in my daughter's kindergarten class. I take off one star for the stinky smell. Otherwise, they're awesome looking and, surprisingly, individually packaged. Would order again."
4.0,"For those who think you are buying a SwissGear (or part of the Swiss Army Knife Wenger company) I'm sorry to report you are not. Customers are confused by the product ""cross"" symbol and think it's a related company (I did). Wenger is one of two companies that have manufactured Swiss Army knives. Based in Del√©mont, Wenger was acquired by rival Victorinox in 2005. Since 2013, Wenger Swiss Army knives are integrated in the Victorinox collection (as the ""Del√©mont collection""); the brand Wenger remains for watches and licensed products. Alpine Swiss is not a licensed company of Victorinox or Wenger."
4.0,love this wig however it's more silver than white
4.0,"I liked these pants a lot, but I had to return them because the fit was much smaller than expected. I always buy a large ( I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7- 190lbs) which typically fit perfectly, but these were too tight. And no, I haven‚Äôt gained any weight. I‚Äôm ordering the x-large to see how they fit. Other than that, I really liked them."
4.0,This umbrella exceeded my expectations. I would buy again. We mounted it on the top deck of our houseboat.
4.0,I liked this but too big
4.0,"I'm 5'7"" tall and I have a 30"" waist. The small size fit me just fine. These feel well made and they're perfect for sub 50¬∞F rides. The padding is not as high quality as some other gear I've worn - it's stiff and there isn't as much coverage over my rear as I'd hoped. But they're sufficient for my morning commutes. I'll probably go name brand next time."
4.0,"These shorts are awesome for workouts really snug they don‚Äôt quite stretch as much as you‚Äôd think, I hit pads with them they do limit your range of motion, I probably wouldn‚Äôt grapple in them, but for workouts 100% super cool. 5‚Äù10.5 205lbs ordered Size 34 I think it was Large they fit my waist great snug on everything else. Was getting them for an MMA but wouldn‚Äôt recommend for that."
4.0,"I‚Äôm giving this four instead of five stars only because I had to sew up the shoulder seems. The length is just what I wanted, and material is super soft and flowy. I took a picture of the extra fabric I sewed at the shoulder area. This extra fabric at the shoulder area caused the sleeves to puff out and it looked really wierd‚ÄîI should have taken a before and after picture. Instead I just took after pictures and I‚Äôm pointing to where the shoulder seem hits the arm, the sleeves are a little funny because the shoulder part is lower on the arm. I bought a medium, am 120lbs, 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and this duster hits an inch or two from the ground."
4.0,Have to take a seem at waist otherwise slips off
4.0,Very odd print. Thought I would like it but I ended up not it's also cut  very small.
4.0,Super cute and comfy. Some of the glitter comes off where the foot bends.
4.0,cute shirt for a big fan of the show
4.0,Nice comfortable bracelet to wear.
4.0,Much smaller than expected so could not see the detail as well.
4.0,I am a little disappointed in the quality of the photo however I do like the bracelet.
4.0,"Sit on my body beautifully,wearing it soon"
4.0,"This little male brown colored wallet is ideal for most men.<br /> It is an ideal size which will fit in most pockets for easy carrying whether it is a shirt pocket of pants it should slip right into the pocket without a lot of bulk.<br /><br />On one side it has a place for the id/drivers license with the little open slot for pushing the card out if needed.<br />On the opposite side it has a place for three credit cards with RFID Blocking which is staggered so you can easily remove the one needed .<br />It also has a zippered compartment for your money which does not open real wide so everything can fall out but open enough for your bills. Your bills must be folded to fit in the zippered compartment.<br /><br />It is described as genuine leather but in my opinion I believe this to be a vinyl ,This is my only reason for giving the product a four star instead of five.<br /><br />  I received this product for free in exchange of my honest review. This review is my true and honest opinion. The fact that I received this product for free does not effect the rating I gave it because I understand how important reviews are when purchasing a product."
4.0,"Great product, I wish it was a little bit wider though."
4.0,"probably could wear a small being that I am only 4-11.5, very loose fitting- which I like a lot."
4.0,Very good quality but size down !
4.0,"I have no real complaints except keep the cardboard papers that the socks come on because putting them back on after air drying will help preserve the shape. I washed and sir dried and if I stretch them first they will be ok, if not they slide off. The silicone backing on the hill is not as sticky as before they are washed."
4.0,daughter looks good in it!
4.0,"I got this as gifts, they are pretty"
4.0,Order a size up...good quality & can't wait to wear it!
4.0,I love how these earrings are made except for the weight. They have a cushioned back fastener so that prevents the earrings from pulling down on your lobes. Very attractive design.  Still love them even if they are a little heavy.
4.0,Although I love these plugs not sure that they are actually made of real stone?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0,"I was skeptical of the pearls on this. I was sure they would make it look cheap, but it's a very elegant looking poncho/shawl. There's lots of room here even for plus sizes-- the smallest sizes may find it a bit too generous. Everyone who wears it will appreciate the softness and warmth, and the color will compliment many outfits both day and night. Great for casual and formal outfits, and all ages."
4.0,"Well made mask and much more comfortable than the regular masks due to the ear and head strap design. Also much cooler and better breathing due to the exhaust ports that expel your breath instead of breathing the air back in and recycling it in your lungs!<br />It is almost perfect and I almost love it.... Except for one problem! It runs small! The height of the mask or the coverage of the mask is short... If you put it where it belongs on the bridge of your nose it comes to the end of your chin... If you put it at the base of your chin where it's supposed to start the top of it is on the tip of your nose... this mask is definitely for someone with a small face like a small woman or adolescent. My second, and only other complaint, is the end of the piping that goes around the edges.... Everything about the mask is good quality but they didn't finish off the piping very well so that will begin to fray eventually and not look as good but it's still his son well and the mask should still hold together well."
4.0,"Perfect for holidays, but cant roll down window once installed."
4.0,I like these but they hang very low. This can be remedied by a shorter hook.
4.0,I like the way it runs long and covers the backside nicely.  I can wear this with leggins.
4.0,Really great quality and has some weight to it more for women though
4.0,"I love the skirt, it is very pretty and seems to be of good quality. The reason this is a 4 star instead of 5, is that this is not at all true to color. I wanted a maroon skirt, and the wine red looked it. It is a dark red, but it is without a doubt red, not maroon/burgundy. Beautiful and will keep it, but it is not what I wanted."
4.0,Nice stone and color.
4.0,"I love the dress and it fits perfect, but came to long, order  Med. I'm 140 & 5'2. I don't know what to do to return it or send it to be fix"
4.0,Very well done.  I wish the seller would tell me how to perhaps stretch it without ruining an otherwise great hat.
4.0,"I gave them a four because the tag states they cannot be machine dried. The colors are vibrant, the owls are cute, the socks fit great, and feel good."
4.0,Really pretty. Kindly pokey underneath so scratches when taking it off.
4.0,"I had to return them because the size was too large for me, otherwise the glasses were nice."
4.0,So far so good. Want to use/try them out a bit longer before giving them 5 stars. For $10 you can't beat them. They get the job done and I work out 4-6 times a week.
4.0,"I really like the A-line cut of this comfortable dress.  This can be worn for so many different events/occasions. It‚Äôs simple yet very flattering.  I‚Äôm a petite and the length was perfect, just hitting the knee. The waist is fitting and accentuates a small waistline.<br /><br />All in all I really like this dress, my only concern is that even though it is black, the fabric shows light through the skirt so I will need to wear a slip which is not my preference. (this is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five)"
4.0,it‚Äôs a really good waste trainer it doesn‚Äôt really lift my butt up but it does make me sweat
4.0,The light button is on the wrong side and light is very weak.  Otherwise I am happy with it.
4.0,"It's super cute, but smaller than I expected."
4.0,"Sturdy, strong,  beautiful color, strong handles."
4.0,A little more snug in the crotch area than I like but not enough to warrant a larger size. I enjoyed wearing them to an evening event. Since I am short (5‚Äô4‚Äù) they fit like a regular pant. Thankful no hemming was involved.
4.0,"I love this BUT it‚Äôs not 18 inches. It is just barely if you include the heart. Otherwise it‚Äôs 16 inches & fits more like a choker on me. Otherwise, it‚Äôs very nice. It has a good weight to it and I can‚Äôt speak to how long the finish will last but it‚Äôs very pretty. I may keep it and give it to my slim 17-year-old granddaughter."
4.0,It is smaller than I thought but it still fits fine. I would have sized up to allow more room.
4.0,Great buy and I look forward to ordering more.
4.0,All the kids loved to play with these just be careful because there are small batteries in them and they can easily come out. Avoid these if there are small children around who might put them or the batteries in their mouths. They are really fun for big kids though.
4.0,"They did not come with a backing for the earring, but I just put on my own. Also, just know that the puffs are quite flat upon arrival, so they require some plumping to look like the picture. Cute for the price. Took about 2 months to be delivered."
4.0,Love the case which helps to protect it when not inuse. Perfect for any age.. Adjustable
4.0,Super dooper cute. Would recommend getting gel &#34;ball of the foot&#34; inserts however as the bottom is really firm and needs some cushioning
4.0,I ordered small size but waist part is little bit loose for me. I can put my fist in between. I normally wear 26 inch-pants and small size of gym leggings from other brands.
4.0,I wanted a tighter fit and this shirt does it. Neckline is ugly but it's an undershirt so don't care to much. That's the only reason it got 4 instead of 5
4.0,Good quality and size. I had a bit hard time at the first to figure out how to place them on my cardigans. They look great.
4.0,It was a bit bigger than what it describes
4.0,After having knee surgery it helps me since I can't use pantyhose  and knee highs aren't high enough. The thigh high is the answer for me.
4.0,great.  It made me laugh and fit as I thought it would.  Screen print is quality as well as the sweatshirt.  This is a sweatshirt not a sweater.
4.0,These pens are very nice.  Free long and smooth.  I bought to sets of them. Unfortunately one set had a blue pen in it without the cap on and got all over the lid and other pens.  Took a little clean but rest of the pens were good.
4.0,"Cute hat for the price.  I purchased on for myself and one for my son.  The had is small for my head, but it will fit.  Not something I would want to wear for hours, as it is a bit tight.  It fits my 5 year old son's head with room to grow."
4.0,"Good quality but for small kids only, less than 5 years old"
4.0,I ordered a medium but found it runs very long and wide. I should have ordered a s.
4.0,I would recommend these to anyone who needs to wear flip flop type sandals or slippers.  Very useful with slippers in the house.
4.0,hose was just not long enough to cover pool
4.0,"Love it! Exactly what I expected.  Nice size.  Wonderful artistry and handiwork.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because i feel the opening of the clasp could be a little larger to accommodate my putting on the necklace without assistance.  Other than that, I definitely recommend."
4.0,Exactly as described. Although one pair was broken.
4.0,"I gained 60lb (was 120, but now almost 180lb) into this pregnancy, but I am still aspiring to size 6 after I deliver. The bra is a bit tight, but I am planning to fit into it better after delivery."
4.0,I love these but they are extremely difficult to snap on and off.
4.0,Got this for a coworker for Christmas and she loves and wears them in the office all the time. It‚Äôs cold in our office and works very well.
4.0,sturdy and very pretty. for daughter wedding.
4.0,"Good looking top. Fits as expected. I am usually small to med in tops. In this brand I am large. For comparison, I am 145lb, 5'5"" 34D."
4.0,"I really liked this but I couldn't fit into it what I wanted.  I didn't even try.  I showed it to my daughter in case she might want it as she carries smaller purses than I do and it was too small for her.  I am sure if you only put a single key, money, credit cards and a lipstick and maybe small perfume you might be ok.  I wish it came in a bigger size."
4.0,This works well but it is pricey for what you get and is somewhat fragile.
4.0,Soft material. Looked great on my daughter
4.0,"This is what I was looking for after being unable to find them at a couple of local retail businesses. I usually go through  a couple pairs of these in the summer. If your lenses are particulary thick then the clips won't quite ""grab"" as they should but will still work and not slide around too much."
4.0,"My husband is a Coastie and a cutterman! Decided to get him these cufflinks for my sister's upcoming wedding and surprisingly they are pretty sweet! A good weight, definitely not light weight and the rope is a nice added touch! The price isn't bad at all, had it been in the 30's I may not have purchased it."
4.0,Very nice dress. I‚Äôm a true size 6 and this dress is SMALL. TOO SMALL FOR ME. Go up one or two sizes.
4.0,Liked fit material is a bit heavy for my needs but ok.  Color and fit are true
4.0,"I chose the seamless charcoal yoga pants and love the print on them. I got a size bigger and yet they were snug, so I guess if you are buying one, get a size up.<br /><br />The material is comfortable and thick. Love the high waist band which can be pulled up if you are comfortable with high pants or can be folded to reduce the height. They offer great coverage. The fabric is stretchable but the size is a little small in the hip area even though I have narrow hips and &quot;strong&quot; thighs. No problem on the thigh area though. I use them during my work out and haven't en-contoured any problem as yet.<br /><br />I received this product during a promotional discount in exchange for my fair and honest review. No further compensation was received. All thoughts are 100% my own and reflect my own personal experiences with the product. My reviews are always honest on how I feel about the product and discounts or samples provided to me for testing purposes do not influence my reviews!"
4.0,Love this with leggings!
4.0,"Fits great, like the style. It's a cool, go anywhere hat."
4.0,We got this for my son who was in Les Miserables and we really like it. The fabric is slick and kinda weird. My son normally wears a Large and we got the XXL and it just fits. Definitely size up a couple of sizes.
4.0,You know I had to be apprehensive about what would be in the box when the watch arrived. Now approx two weeks into the experience I'm good and So is the watch. I'm not convinced its a every day kinda watch but it makes a real nice fashion switch up. Good color and style
4.0,not best fit... so i have to return<br />but quality is fine ... genuine light weight .... elegant...
4.0,SIZE DOWN! Cute top! Love it
4.0,This is a great item. Good quality and great packaging.
4.0,"This is a nice, comfortable to wear, zip up hoodie. I ordered it in my usual size large and it does fit pretty well although it is slightly baggy or at least compared to another hoodie I have by this brand in the same size.  To compare, I laid the other hoodie on top of this one, and this hoodie is 3 or 4 inches bigger, width wise.  The sizing measurements provided by the seller do seem to be pretty accurate though so I would go by their chart to determine what will work best for you. For me, I can easily wear a t-shirt underneath without the hoodie being too tight.<br /><br />The hoodie sweatshirt is pretty soft even after washing and drying.  I washed and dried according to directions (cold and tumble dry low) and it looks and feels just fine.  The item does come with a Proposition 65 label.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with this sweatshirt as it's great for lounging around the house or when you are going for a casual look."
4.0,"Love these boots, beautiful, edgy and beyond comfortable!!! 4 stars due to some loose stitching on one boot; not bad enough to complain, but definitely a disappointment. I use these to complete my look with old jeans & sweatshirts, they work the look. Will probably buy the dark brown hoping they are flawless for a dressier look."
4.0,Its a nice watch. I don't wear it much but when I doI get compliments on it.
4.0,Great looking and well made. I subtracted 1 star for adjustment clips that sticks out from hat.
4.0,The dress is very cute. I originally purchased a large based off of other reviews saying to go two sizes up. The dress was too large so I returned it and got a medium instead. I usually wear a S 4/6. Medium fit well. I kept pulling it down throughout the day however because it has a narrow cut and rode up a bit. For the price it was a great deal. Material is pretty thick and I like the size and stiffness of the collar a lot too.
4.0,"Very cute shirt. The fabric material is very slippery, so you have to retie the arm hole ties every few minutes unless you double knot them. It makes it difficult to do by yourself because if you‚Äôre trying to tie the arm holes while wearing the shirt (to make sure your arm fits through the tie) then it is nearly impossible. But overall I like the style and for the price it is worth buying."
4.0,"Pretty bracelets,  very delicate."
4.0,Product claims to come with 1 filter. No filters were supplied. Masks look great.
4.0,"Love it. Very cute, as described. Read comments to order 2x larger then american size. I am a Large, ordered XL.. Feels like it wouldve been true to size. The top wouldve been perfect as a L and the bottom a M."
4.0,It's pretty & nice to wear with dresses or tops with an open back. A bit smaller than anticipated yet it still fits me.
4.0,"They run extremely small, I am a 5' woman and they just fit my hands..but there are a lot of them for the price. I was planning to use them for home painting projects because I hate sweating in latex or plastic gloves. I do not think they would fit a man's hand, but that's just my opinion."
4.0,Wasn‚Äôt sure when I got it... however I received many complementary thoughts.
4.0,My son has been wanting a necklace for awhile to be &#34;cool&#34;. I got the S one for his initial and he loves it. He says he's a cool kid now. It is a cheaper necklace because I wouldn't trust him with an expensive one but so far it's held up. It's a great length and can change the length to make it easier to deal with. The actual medallion is about the size of a penny so it's not too gaudy. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,Great dress and fabric. Except the bodice fits right under your breast not at the waist like the picture shows. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 158lbs and bought  a large.
4.0,"This came in a nice black box with 6 pairs of socks nicely/ neatly  rolled up.<br /><br />The sock are not heavy duty, but light and airy, but not see threw..the socks do not come up high, about  2 inches above the ankle.<br />My husband when wearing a suit does not wear short socks..But my son is a chef, stands on his feet allot and liked these socks.<br />He felt his feet were dryer then wearing regular black socks..<br />Not sure about the smell!"
4.0,"This suit is so cute.  Love the little ties on the bottom.  I bought this for my daughter in size 7-8, but it was too small. It fit my other daughter who normally wears size 6."
4.0,"Great jacket and close to what I expected. Pretty tight around the shoulders/upper arms, but still able to comfortably get it on and off."
4.0,Little small for a male. I bought for my SO and it was too small for him. Other than that great for a large kid or an adult. Super soft. Super comfy.
4.0,Dress is cuter than I thought it would be..nice material. It just took 2 months to arrive. But I really like the dress!
4.0,This mask is one of the most comfortable I‚Äôve purchased. The material is nice and soft and fits snuggly under my chin AND over my nose when adjusted. The words on the bottom are a little sewn together and that‚Äôs unfortunate but the only downside I find.
4.0,"Very thin material, was hoping for soft cotton like fabric but it'll work"
4.0,"The pants are pretty much awesome, I'd just say order 1 size above what you're thinking for maximum comfort. If you plan of doing any kind of IWB, you may want to go 2+ sizes up. I have 8 pairs, still a great value, but the material in the 3 pairs I recently purchased seems different. 1 pair has poor stitching on the belt toops and are showing wear after only 2 uses. 1 other pair develped a hole in the left hand pocket."
4.0,My son has wanted this mask forever! We bought it for him as a gift and he was thrilled with it!  Worth the money and the wait!!!
4.0,The idea of the outfit is nice but when on it's not the most flattering. I kept it because I just sleep in it. I would recommend getting slightly larger than your usual size. The top especially was tight around my chest and kinda flattens my chest.
4.0,Bought for son's Prom.  Returning only because the color isn't right.  It's a nice shirt.  A bit thin but aren't they all.
4.0,pretty cool halloween tie as far as halloween ties go
4.0,"This belt is so cool! A friend of my husband's got one for Christmas, and told us about it, so I got one. It's just cool. It works. Holds his pants up!"
4.0,"Came earlier than the window given, item is as shown. Good chain length, pendant appears quite solid and weighty. Slight odor of adhesive, so I would suggest letting it sit out before wearing. Packaging was secure, wrapped well for its long journey"
4.0,Such a lovely necklace.  A little extra solder where it attaches to the chain prevented five stars.
4.0,fit my guy well
4.0,Cute for the price !
4.0,They came within a month which is expected when you're ordering from China so no complaints with the delivery. c: They're really cute! They look exactly like the picture as well which includes size so that's good. I have no complaints with the product nor the seller - I recommend them. I bought the earrings as a gift who loooves owls so she's sure to love them too.
4.0,Easy on and off. Cool in warm weather.
4.0,The material feels thick and the sleeves are a little loose. I like it.
4.0,"Full Disclosure: I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review. I then gave it to a friend and this is her unbiased review:<br /><br />I love HopSooken Toiletry Bag! It‚Äôs great for travel and I even use it at home. It‚Äôs basically my bathroom away from home in a bag. ÔÅä Although it looks small it actually holds a pretty decent amount of H&B items; including a full basic makeup set, toothbrush/paste, body wash, wipes, etc.; comfortably. Safe to machine wash and just as easy to wipe clean. Great for organization and an awesome space-saver. I would recommend to people who travel and use a lot of cosmetics; it‚Äôll definitely save you time and space.<br /><br />If the bag was a little bigger it would be a five star item."
4.0,"Freaks out the dog and my parents, but my brothers loved opening it on Christmas morning. Kind of had a plastic-y smell, but if you wear it once or twice and air it out it's fine. Funny!"
4.0,Pretty good item !
4.0,Love this oil case<br /> The only drawback is that if you put the oil bottles in it as intended they'd be hanging upside down if you hang it from something. So I put the bottles in the case upside down. Now when I hang the case from my purse the bottles are upright.
4.0,"Very cute. But very big. For reference: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 140lbs, 38DD, and I have a 35‚Äù waist and I‚Äôm drowning in a large. I was scared a large would be too small, but I was way wrong. Dress is a good length for tall people. Hits me mid thigh. Material is definitely thin and super stretchy, though. I will be wearing a tank top under it and probably some shorts, too."
4.0,My daughter loves hers and the fit is perfect.<br /><br />Mine fits great but the crotch area is a little tight. I'm keeping it but we'll have after I wear it wet on how comfortable it is.
4.0,"I love this wallet, there are plenty of card slots and pockets! I didn't have any problems getting my cards to fit or all of my stuff for that matter.  Super cute and durable. Definately recommend it!"
4.0,Cute light summer dress. As described.
4.0,Easy to install and surprisingly very durable! Only thing I had a problem with is that I wish the claw spring was a little stronger or had a lock so other sets of keys attached to it wouldn't unlatch when stored in places like your pocket.
4.0,"I wear a size 34 or 36 depending on the pants. Since I read reviews that these run both large and small, I went with the size 36, which fit but are looser than I expected (although manageable). I've ordered a size 34, to see if that fits better.<br /><br />The internal button on the fly wasn't secured down, and unthreaded the first time I tried the pants on. (lost a star)<br /><br />I'm buying these for a muli-day camping / hiking trip and will update my review based on the smaller sized pants, as well as how they hold up."
4.0,"This fits snug in the arms, would recommend going up a size from your normal shirt size. I wear a medium and should have gotten large."
4.0,"First I ordered a medium and had to send it back and got a small. Very thin, not sure how long it will last but I like the fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 155."
4.0,"Okay so I got it a whole week ahead of the estimate date which is really great!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-lots of space<br />-exactly what's in the photos<br /><br />Cons:<br />-it smells like really strong plastic, when I opened it my head started hurting because of the smell<br />-idk there's this thing that won't come off of the plastic, like a fur type thing? It's not really noticeable so whatever.<br /><br />But I'd rate this 9/10 hyungwon memes, minus one because of the plastic smell, I don't know how to get rid of it"
4.0,I was hoping for something a little more substantial than the original.  This feels about the same and was higher priced than others.
4.0,Very satisfied! Pretty close to size. I think I added one size but comfy & sexy. Did the trick ;)
4.0,I always buy a set of cheap aviators for the car and these are like described. Only dinged for stiff arms.
4.0,I like the washed out color it has. I'm a fan of horses. The cap adjusts to fit your size
4.0,The tail is ridiculous but I love the ears
4.0,"I had to return this, even though I loved the size and style. The color was awful."
4.0,"I really like this swimsuit! It looks just like the photo and the skirt is long enough, I'm 5'8&#34;.  It is slightly smaller than expected, I wear a 18 and purchased a 20. It fits but a little snug.  It's a super great deal for the price though!  I'm also not big chested, and I have trouble finding suits that the bra cups aren't too big. This one fits great!"
4.0,Love the idea of the float cropped pant. I didn‚Äôt like the material. It felt weird and the texture wasn‚Äôt my style.
4.0,The material is very thin and see through.  But the dress itself is gorgeous.
4.0,Get it!!!
4.0,"Package arrived quickly. I actually like it a lot. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc my key has a panic button and the cover doesn't include a cutout for the panic button. Other than that, the cover feels smooth and like it is made of high quality materials."
4.0,With or without filter it works.
4.0,This is perfect earings I give 5 star for this .
4.0,If you need a water proofing solution that was made specifically for my Timberlands.
4.0,True to size and fit nicely
4.0,"I like these shirts. My only complaint is the length. I wish they were four inches longer. But, only because hate my belly showing when I workout."
4.0,"Good quality leggings, aren't thin or too stretchy.but they are a little small"
4.0,"I was getting tired of the standard band that came with my Gear Fit 2.  It was coming apart a lot whenever I'd get really active, which defeats the purposed of the device since it won't stay on.  This band is very nice and keeps the band on my wrist at all times.  Now, the magnetic clasp works very well, but is not perfect (but what is these days?).  The band goes through a loop on one side that allows for you to size it according to your wrist and then place the magnet on the band and keep it all secured on your wrist.  The magnet does seem to slide just a little down the band over a period of time when using this band as you move around.  It hasn't come off or slid down to a point where the band opens enough to slide off my hand, but it does start to slide a little up and down my wrist.  Nothing that concerns me in day to day use.  I do wish they would have put a piece of rubber or silcone on the back of the magnet to keep it from attaching itself to other metal objects you may come in contact with though out the day.  It would also keep it from scratching objects or being scratched itself.  Careful if you have hairy arms/wrists as this can seem to tug on your hair due to the chain mesh type material and the magnet closing on them when placing it on the band.  Overall, very easy to use and a lot more secure than the original band.  I love the black color and it adds a little class/elegance to this watch that the original band did not provide."
4.0,"Fits well, comfortable and fabric is as expected."
4.0,I love it but the sizing was wayyyyyy off I got a 10 and it didn‚Äôt fit took it to a jewelry store and they laughed they said this isn‚Äôt a women‚Äôs 10 at all this is a women‚Äôs 11
4.0,Fits perfect and flattering.  IS VERY SHEER!  Returned.
4.0,"smaller than expected, but still cute"
4.0,Nice chain. Expectations met.
4.0,Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it irritated my forehead pretty bad. Not sure why.
4.0,Very functional at a low price. Material is very thin plastic but the colors are spiffy. If careful in wearing and storage then should last for several uses.
4.0,My daughter's a big T-Rex fan and she loved this little key chain for Valentine's Day. The colors are just like the picture shown. Great little gift.
4.0,This was a little big for my small wrist but quality was good.
4.0,Very pretty! Great price
4.0,I love the material quality.<br /><br />It's one size and so a bit too full for me.
4.0,I love tube socks for boys but a little small for the one boy
4.0,I mean they aren‚Äôt a flexible material but they are cute and look good. Sadly a bit long on me but I‚Äôm short. Only problem I had was that I could see my skin color under the pants because of the material but that‚Äôs the only problem.
4.0,Pin backs aren‚Äôt great.
4.0,Had no issues at all!
4.0,"These are cute shorts, and they fit well. The only thing I don't care for is they are short. The inseam is only about 3"". If they were a tad longer, they would be perfect."
4.0,"Fits great, looks even better."
4.0,Soft material. I wish the neckline was a little wider for the plus sizes.
4.0,"as soon as i tried it on all the buttons start to fall off, but for the price not bad"
4.0,"I was sort of unsure about them at first but once I started pairing them with shoes, and shirt, I began to absolutely love them.  I am 5‚Äô9, 180 lbs, and I have large hips and butt so I order the XL.  Because of my large hips and butt they were not as long as I would have liked.  I‚Äôm going to take them to a tailor and have them undo the stitching at the bottom to make them a little bit longer. That would make them about 1/2 inch longer. The attached picture is before I paired them with shoes and shirt."
4.0,gave 4 stars as they run a bit big and fall down when you are wearing them as a face mask.
4.0,"I was tired of always reaching for my phone when on adventures for a simple time check so I decided to look at watches that would function well for hiking/backpacking/adventuring and saw this one suggested on the Backpacking Light forums. This watch works wonderfully for my adventures, but I have since started wearing it every day. It has a single alarm and stopwatch functions as well. It's water-resistant, easy to read, and I have no complaints. Overall a good cheap watch that gets the job done. Its price point stifles any worries about shelling out hundreds of dollars for a new watch in the event you need to replace it."
4.0,Fits a bit smaller than expected but nice quality
4.0,I‚Äôm glad it had strings to tie. I used black Elastic hair tie on each arm. Finished it.
4.0,"Thin, but so soft and comfy! I would recommend sizing up a size if you like a looser fit!"
4.0,"It seemed thick and well made. The sheer part doesnt look cheap or like it will run/rip. Top fit me well as im more narrow waist n barely a B , pretty darn cute. BUT.... im curvy in the bottom/ thigh (7-9bottoms) and the elastic was too tight on the rear to pull off in a flattering way, also i think my &#34;average length&#34; torso was too long for the Medium as well"
4.0,"Super cute! If I could change anything, I would prefer a smaller heart."
4.0,"I thought this would be perfect for travel, light weight, dry quickly etc.  They are all of those things but... if you wear pantyliners or pads they won‚Äôt stick... at all.  I have never seen anything like it.  I tried different brands even.  So be aware."
4.0,This skirt was super cute. I really liked the fabric and the zipper was a fun detail. I didn't end up keeping it because the waist was just a bit too snug. It felt like good quality too.
4.0,Got this cute leggings for my 6 year old and she loved it. The material is so soft and it stretches .
4.0,Overall love this for my 15 year old son. Perfect price point and look for a teenage boy.
4.0,"She really likes it !<br />I gave this watch to my granddaughter as a Christmas gift.  She really likes the color and the &#34;sparkles&#34;, and in this digital world, it's still good to learn to read a watch without various other bells and whistles.  The band is soft and conforms easily to her small wrist with ample holes in the band.  It will be interesting to know how well it holds up and I'll revisit this review if need be.  I also told her that every time I get to visit, we always have a good &#34;time&#34;.<br />My only drawback to the watch is that there weren't instructions included in the box for her to show how to set time, proper care etc."
4.0,"The material is light with tiny holes to breath. I‚Äôve washed and dried it a number of times without any fading.<br />At 5 6‚Äù 170 lb, I‚Äôm shorter and a medium felt longer than most medium shirts. The chest size feels just fine so going down a size won‚Äôt work.<br />Most likely my frame size and style of the shirt I‚Äôll get use too.<br />I notice a lot of people now wearing the brand.<br />For the price it‚Äôs hard to beat a decent workout shirt that can take a weekly thrashing."
4.0,These are really cute!! Very soft and they look great
4.0,"The pendant is ok, it really looks good, is as describe. The Colors white in the butterfly. I recommended as a gift"
4.0,Fit in torso and breast was true to size. The length is no so much. Have to wear with leggings.
4.0,"A little on the tighter end, but still fit"
4.0,Mangas muy largas y un poco m√°s largo ser√≠a ideal
4.0,"This is a really cute overalls. It doesn't really feel like denim, and the straps are a pain to adjust. But once you've got it figured out, its cute."
4.0,"I do recommend, love these, love the material, love the fit, so comfortable and they have pockets too,<br />totally 100% SKIRTALICIOUS!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
4.0,I‚Äôd order one size up it‚Äôs a bit tight
4.0,Ordered this dress for my dtr to wear for prom ...very flattering ...material is thin but for the price it was a good buy ...ordered a medium for her ...she is usually a size 8-10
4.0,From the hip to top perfect size.... from the hip down fits a little baggy.
4.0,"I have wide feet, 10.5EEE. These replacement inserts were narrower than the originals, even though I specifically ordered the EEE inserts, although the difference in width was only a 1/4"" it's definitely noticeable. Still better than all the other inserts I've tried."
4.0,"Beautiful dress - nice color,  nice heavy fabric, so the drape is great - but across the chest and arms waaay too tight - if it had been sleeveless and with larger armholes, it would have been a keeper.  Soo sad.  And I did get one size up as had been recommended by other reviewers.  Will by this brand again because the quality is great, but nothing with sleeves..."
4.0,Good one and I will recommend to my friend
4.0,"Super cute but it runs very small... I normally use size S , ordered M and was very tight... I am returning it and ordering size L because I loved the quality and style!"
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. I ordered the small. I'm 5'0 and it was a little long but I wore heels and it was perfect.  it worked great as a maternity dress for my baby shower. Plus..pockets!!!
4.0,"Now if there was a way to animate the tongue like in the movies ti would be great. As with all masks that cover the ears, your sense of hearing is going to be affected. Some find this disturbing, and unfortunately, I'm one of them."
4.0,"Love this visor. It protects and doesn‚Äôt fog up, even when it‚Äôs really cold outside or when coming into a cool building when I have been out in the heat. If you accidentally drop it or it slides off the seat of your car, the arms will pop off, but I have learned to put them back on. If not for that issue, I would give it 5 stars"
4.0,"It's OK,  very nice, but I noticed on the inner looks dark and not shine as the outer but I'm OK otherwise from that with my purchase"
4.0,Great hostess gift. Clever packaging.
4.0,"I liked the quality, the size, the material. Overall a good bag, I thought it was going to be cheap looking but it was better than expected."
4.0,I like that it's easy to use but wish I could print in colors.
4.0,good for the price..and definitely cute. but i feel like a real nurse on her feet needs 20mm compression and a better spandex to nylon ratio...but these are great for the price
4.0,"Love these,  easy on easy off,  and I can continue to wear my flip flops."
4.0,I love the soft light material. I typically wear a 16-18 woman's top due to my bust size. This fits perfectly through the shoulders and torso but it is LONG. This would look great with leggings. I am 5ft 5in with an average torso and this hangs below my butt. If I went smaller I wouldn't be happy with the fit. This is a great shirt.
4.0,I like the dress very much except the back waist zip pocket is awkward to open and close and should be placed in the front.<br />The concept in spot on.
4.0,"Definitely on the smaller side, so just check your measurements. Otherwise it is comfy and matches the picture exactly in color. Material is soft and has some stretch to it. Easy to clean (I chose to hand wash each time just to preserve color and to avoid shrinking)."
4.0,"Bought the gray (with zip front) in XXL. Runs small in the chest. Only 4 stars because chest is not 51"", more like 47 to 48"" in the chest. Great fabric & construction, very comfortable. Was wanting a roomier fit, but I do like it."
4.0,I really like these &#34;bodystocking&#34; lingerie options since they also work well on me and I am far from looking like this model. It also is so tight it helps hold the ladies where I want them and squeezes my curves in all the right places enhancing the sexy for sure. I would definitely recommend those looking to feel sexy but who have issues with the typical lingerie.
4.0,Cute shirt but fit a little more snug than I wanted
4.0,"I love this shirt and normally wear a large, but this is way too big....."
4.0,Definitely get measurements before buying. Tough material. The neck part is very tough and almost digs into neck buuuut WORTH the buy for smallville/Superman fans. Looks exactly like picture. Very cool! Heavy material. Functional!
4.0,Is nice for the price is a great gift
4.0,Arrived quickly.  The lenses are mirrored. I didn‚Äôt like the nose pads as they are metal. But they sent a pair of replacement nose pads and an eye glass repair kit with a little screwdriver.
4.0,"Update 6/2021: I bought 2 of these purses. I love the purse design (compact with many pockets & zippered areas). However, the strap on one purse was a different length‚ÄîSIX inches shorter than the strap on the other purse!  I contacted the company but they would not  send me a longer strap. They requested that I send pictures (which I did). Then they refunded one of the purses. The pursers are already starting to show wear."
4.0,"When it's cool but not cold around here and I plan to play pickleball or run on the trails, I love to start out with a set of sleeves, which is why I chose this item.<br /><br />The fabric is super shiny and stretchy, and it's one size fits all, so I wondered whether it might be too small for me at 120#. I needn't have worried. The sleeves fit fine across the back and along the length of my arms. The only problem is that because I am not larger, the middle back part of the shrug pooches out in the center, which isn't very flattering. And the fabric is absolutely not moisture-wicking, which is fine for simply walking, but not as great for running (which is more likely to lead to sweating). In summary, this shrug fits petite-size me and has shiny, stretchy fabric but, but because it's one size fits all, it's going to be loose and a little poochy across the back."
4.0,My granddaughter seemed to like them.
4.0,Fast shipping great product.
4.0,nice but the material is kinda cheap... you get what you pay for...:(
4.0,"I like the overall look of this shirt but I wish it were a little more float and also wish the armpit area didn‚Äôt flare out. Would be very hard for me to wear without a tank or sports bra under it. I guess it‚Äôll be good to throw over a swimsuit! Also the design is a bit sticky, more like vinyl than sublimated."
4.0,"I put some items in the pockets and the pants kept slipping down below my hips, but I like them anyway."
4.0,It's a little bigger by the bust
4.0,The stiches came off.
4.0,"The fabric is very nice.The color is off. The pink is very light. At first glance almost looks tan. It was a little bigger than I expected, but it did fit in my purse. The slots for the credit cards are very tight, almost not big enough,making it very hard to get the cards in and out. I'm hoping with a little use they will strech out a little. One zipper compartment is a little difficult to close smothly."
4.0,"These are a great slim fit. We can‚Äôt use them for our navy school uniform, but will use them for nice pants. We got a size 12 for 85 lb/5‚Äô kid."
4.0,Lindo aunque pesa un poco queda muy elegante no le doy las cinco estrellas porque ten√≠a un desperfecto en el acabado pero igual lo us√© y recib√≠ muchos halagos
4.0,The top is a little bigger then I would normally get but still fits wish I could exchange the top for a medium but I love it it covers my stomach just what I wanted. And still look cute
4.0,"It seems like a nice bag. I just received it in the mail today.  I am a little disappointed in the brown color. It's more orange than I was anticipating. It's fine, I'll still use it but not quite the color I expected based on the pictures."
4.0,Very nice material that gives a nice fit
4.0,"I reviewed the sizing guide which said this product ran small since it was in Asian sizing.  It was right, if you want to order this, make sure you order 2-3 sizes bigger than you normally need or it will not fit.  Other than a slight sizing issue, this product is great quality and very comfortable."
4.0,Some reviewers mentioned about the clasp.  It's very thin.  Not sure how much wears ill get but overall very nice looking bracelet
4.0,I love the look of the product. Had a small issue but they took care of the issue quickly and professionally. I would recommend this.
4.0,Nice fit good
4.0,Ok. Just wasn't of the quality I thought they would be
4.0,This item ships straight from China so shipping takes long. The color is darker from what it looks on the online pictures. Quality seems OK. Satisfied for the price.
4.0,"10/21<br />I got this for my daughter. She works overnight and suffers from a sleep disorder. She could never hear her alarm no matter  how loud. She‚Äôs gone threw the sonic alarm clock, constantly having friends call her and even go to her house to wake her up. She‚Äôs been using this for I think about a month or so. She still gets shocked to wake up on her own but, she has begun to hear sounds around her when she‚Äôs asleep such as the phone ringing, which she could hear before. I do believe that this watch is in some way training her brain to be more aware when she‚Äôs sleeping. I think for them moment it‚Äôs been a good purchase for her!<br />12/18<br />Update..  it worked great at first!! After about a month it stopped working (no more shock).<br />I sent it back figured it was a glitch. We received the new one three days ago. My daughter went to put it on and the strap snapped!! We won‚Äôt be trying this brand again. It‚Äôs to bad the quality isn‚Äôt better. My daughter really liked it and it was working for her.. :("
4.0,"This Orchid Row - an Amazon brand - hat with crushed velveteen band is a felt hat that holds it's shape. It has a nice, wide brim and a grosgrain ribbon lining the perimeter inside the hat. This hat is maroon with a black top & black, crushed velveteen (contains polyester) band.<br /><br />The hat feels like it is made out of felt with a stiffener added to it. The hat holds its shape very well and the brim is not floppy. The crushed velveteen band is removable, which is good since I am going to replace it with a leather braid."
4.0,"I have quite a few dresses from this brand, so I was a bit surprised at the quality of this one. The fabric is on the thinner side and not in a good way. It feels like a cheap t-shirt. The pleated waist is the best thing about this dress. It might be fine for running errands, but definitely not for dressier occasions. The fit is true to size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,The drape is lovely and the contrasting skirt makes it a good choice for many events.
4.0,"Fit as expected.  But much lighter than expected, so hope it's warm."
4.0,Product and delivery were great.  Packaging was appalling.  A plastic bag inside a large box inside another plastic bag for a pair of shorts?!  Shame on whoever is responsible.
4.0,"I ordered a larger size based on reviews, but probably overdid it.  Regarless, it's a cute suit to wear on one piece days.  :-)  Comfortable and flattering."
4.0,"Looks made well,  but looks really big, nervous the 6-12 months won't fit my 12 month old niece"
4.0,"Lovely sweater, great quality but runs very small"
4.0,"Well made, but the navy is really dark... almost black."
4.0,"It's adorable,  just should've read the size description.  It's tiny lol"
4.0,"The delivery for this item takes longer than expected. But, worth the wait. I love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4.0,"When I first took these pants out of the pkg to wear they weren't the softest, but I have a burgundy pair that felt the same way, well.I love them they are soft, comfy for lounging or running out to the store, deep pockets so I don't drop or lose my phone lol. Overall these pants are a 10.<br />Price is great for the quality too.<br />Im 5""6 and am 134 and I got a Medium."
4.0,Oversized. Warm. Great for a cool house.
4.0,Love love love this dress...  shipping was stupid long. That's the only thing I can say negative about it. Tons of compliments.
4.0,Great dress for the event I went too. I bought the medium.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô‚Äô8‚Äù 36c chest 150lbs
4.0,My grandson loves them. They are so cute!
4.0,"Very pretty concept, the fabric is not the best, not the worst. Just kind of like an umbrella type of feel but thicker. The design is beautiful though, except the pants are very long. You‚Äôd have to be a super model to not need to hem them."
4.0,"It is very stretchy but the ankles could be more tapered. As far as length, I‚Äôm 5,8 with curves and they hit like a peddle pusher (I ordered a large). If the ankles didn‚Äôt flare, I wouldn‚Äôt mind but I‚Äôll always wear them in a boot"
4.0,I LOVE these things!  Sizing definitely runs small though.  I'm a 36-38 in the waist and the XXL fit me perfectly
4.0,Really pretty for work
4.0,"This is like 4.5 Stars. Great fit, looks good. Wrinkles SUPER easy."
4.0,"Drastically reduced swelling normally experienced from 13 hour flight!  Shipping was very prompt, quality was suprisingly decent, relatively comfortable & did its job!<br /><br />I wear a size 8, average/relatively thin build, pretty average calves - ordered a medium and it fit great."
4.0,"A really good bell boot for the price.  My guy is really good at stepping on himself and turning his glue on shoes into flip flops.  A week of 24-7 wear and there are no rubs , the Velcro is not wimpy and they are a bit dented, but not torn.  My only wish is that they were just a tad bit longer."
4.0,It‚Äôs okay but smaller than I thought it would be.  I used it for a prop in a play and wanted to have a larger peace sign necklace so it could be seen.  Nice workmanship though.
4.0,It‚Äôs not what it looks like it‚Äôs thin cheap fabric. It‚Äôs more of a casual material
4.0,I REALLY LIKE
4.0,"The shelf bra is a little uncomfortable and the length is a bit too long for me, but wearing them under another shirt is fine."
4.0,It's not fancy but we'll worth the $3 I paid. It keeps getting tangles when I remove it buy once I get it on I get compliments on how cute it is.
4.0,Slightly smaller than I would like. Good quality.
4.0,Boots are good quality and fit as expected.
4.0,It is still nice.
4.0,"They are warm, and comfortable but a big headache for men.  The pants do not have a slit or opening in them and in order to go to the bathroom, you have to almost undress in order to pull them down to relieve yourself.  They would be excellent for women but not for men!"
4.0,"You get what you pay for, still, a pretty cool bracelet"
4.0,Cute pattern and well made
4.0,"I got the orange version of the wallet. The orange color is slightly duller than the actual pictire (its darker than my photo though) and thebinside color, which I hoped to be like a bright blue/green, but its darker and not vivid as I would have wanted it.<br /><br />Other than that, I love this sturdy compact wallet. It holds quite a bit and I never have to worry about anything slipping out. Still a good buy :)"
4.0,Happy with purchase!!
4.0,Protegen muy bien los lentes. Pero estoy de acuerdo con el otro review que el olor es insoportable. Lo estoy manteniendo abierto y espero que con el tiempo el olor desapareza. Ya ah pasado con otros productor pero este olor es m√°s fuerte. Huele como animal muerto üòÖ
4.0,"Love it for the price, nice and simple design. Light weight, material could be softer; however, for the price it's great."
4.0,"Great looking warm jacket. Has a good hood for use in wind and rain. It sheds water well, not sure how it would do in a downpour. The only thing wrong was a loose edge on the inside pocket."
4.0,"This is the second dress in this style I have bought, so far. This dress is super cute, but will need a few additions to make it work. The dress is see through, so a slip will be needed. Also, the top looks unfinished, so I will add a collar and pin the shoulders in. The dress' design looks like the picture, but looks like a sack without the changes I plan on adding. If you are not willing to make some of your own alterations I would not buy this. One last thing, the dress is also super short. Leggings will be a must for those of you who are 5'7&#34; or taller. Even with the changes I plan on making I feel like this was an amazing purchase."
4.0,"Looks great, however the under skirt that keeps the outer skirt from being see through is way to short and doesnt cover up where it should."
4.0,"Arrived very quickly. I really like the quality of these AJ 9 fleece shorts, but would probably order a size down if I had it to do over again-----that's on me. The only minor criticism I have  is that the drawstring is very short. Not much room to &#34;tie them up&#34;. However, this is something that is manageable with a little creativity and should not be a deal breaker as far as this product is concerned. I would definitely buy these again."
4.0,Great socks they were perfect
4.0,"This strange, minty green watchband caught my eye as, first, a summer color. But even more to the point, a not striped Timex Weekender watchband. I'm tired of Nato stripes on my watchband. So I went for it and bought three non-striped 16 mm watchbands. The green one, a bright pink and a peachy pink. They are so easy to switch. But they are all kind of nutty and would look better as an ice cream flavor...but I hope this inspires Timex to make some less expensive, plain bands in better colors!"
4.0,I'M TYPICALLY A 4 BUT SWIMSUITS SIZE6 SPANX BRAND FIT ME PERFECTLY. SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TO SLIP ON BUT AMAZING FEEL AND LOOK ONCE ON.  WOULD DEFINITELY APPRECIATE A ZIPPER OR SOMETHING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PUT ON/OFF WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT STRETCHING AND SNAPPING. SUPER FLATTERING AND CREATES CURVES AND SILHOUETTE.

4.0,"These are super cute, but they're kind of loose on the head. I had to bend them so they'd stay on my face."
4.0,"Very cute but my daughter who is on tbe smaller end of the scale, didnt fit in it well. The shirt kept riding up, its very short. Her belly was exposed whenever she moved her arms up at all."
4.0,"I loved the colors and the non slip dots were great. They did seem to shrink a tiny bit in the wash, but they still fit. I would prefer them to come up a little higher so when I am using them for exercising that would stay on better, but that is my preference. I would recommend these to anyone looking for this type of sock."
4.0,A little cheap but ok for a costume.
4.0,Solid polo. Fits well. Decent embroidery quality and I love the color.
4.0,Love the dress. Kind of wished it had a slit on the side because u can‚Äôt walk taking big steps because the bottom is narrow.  But I still love it
4.0,its a bit small but im little crafty so im making some adjustments . shouldn't be too bad.
4.0,"It's ok it fits as I expected I'm 5'10&#34; 180, I got a medium which is pretty tight, they are thin"
4.0,Lovely earrings. I've worn them a few times now and like how they sparkle just right in the sun. I purchased a matching necklace and absolutely adore the set.
4.0,Liked the top however it did not have pockets as shown.
4.0,The top was a little small but I made it work
4.0,I bought
4.0,The fabric is super cool and being able to customize is great.  The customization process cost me time but I managed to do it successfully and the shirt arrived completely personalized.  I will buy more without hesitation.
4.0,"A classic jacket.  Little smaller than expected, but I guess the coat was designed smaller.  You can‚Äôt wear a big jacket when you‚Äôre flying a plane.üòé"
4.0,"I should have read the reviews before.  I didn't realize that it was cut like a poncho or that it was so sheer. However that being said, I do love it!!"
4.0,"I ordered these for use with snowblower / snowstorm / snow removal protection from both sunlight and snow drifts and particles from hitting my eyes while clearing my driveway during storms. I do not ski / have never been a skier.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Very comfortable! Easy to adjust, and they stay in place.<br />- Definitely protect against bight sun reflection off the snow and UV.<br />- Definitely protect against snow and particles from hitting my eyes.<br />- Adjustable strap stays snug whether directly on skin or over other hats and balaclava hoods.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- In my experience, such as wearing over my balaclava or along with a facemask, they fog-up despite the adequate venting.<br /><br />My bottom-line opinion - these are great in the under $30 range and perform great when I'm not wearing a face mask or balaclava or anything that pushes warm air upward from my nose and mouth. But when I'm out there clearing with the snowblower in heavy wet snow conditions and wearing mouth/nose covering, they do fog-up and it's difficult to clear the fog/steam moisture from the lens. I can only guess that for normal Ski usage these are excellent at the price-point."
4.0,I really love the buttons on this cardigan. It's great for layering or belting with a cute shirt underneath. There are a few things someone else might find problems with but that dont personally bother me. The cardigan I bought in large is a little body but not uncomfortably tight. If I had bought a medium it might have hugged my curves a bit more. The collar has a tendency to stand up rather than lay flat against my neck but I dont mind it. It's very well made and super comfortable. All around I'd buy another.
4.0,"The reason I gave this gown 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was way too long....actually looks like it was not hemmed, so I'll have to do that myself in order to wear it. I always buy long gowns because they're the most comfortable for me, & even though I'm short, they don't normally come all the way to the floor. This one drags the floor around my feet (the 1st one that's ever done that). Other than that, it looks like the photo. The material is cotton knit, which is a little thicker than I thought it would be, so you could even wear it during the winter. It seems to be well made & not cheap & feels comfortable (other than the length). I'd buy it again if I didn't have to hem it myself! The model must be very tall because on her, the gown comes to where it normally does on me! Or maybe they did neglect to hem the one sent to me. If you're tall, this should fit you perfectly! :)"
4.0,"Love them, love it!"
4.0,"I love the description, fast delivery and great packaging"
4.0,Socks! Wore down about a year later.
4.0,Love the look but can't get them to sit close to my ear ... maybe just too heavy for me. Definitely will enjoy wearing these. they get a 5 for appearance and quality.
4.0,"I like this necklace and wear it all the time, however it is thinner material than I thought it would be and it's actually sharp to the touch on the edges. The chain is pretty fragile. It's cute though."
4.0,Cute dress! Still will need Spanx but the stretch is forgiving. Very retro/pinup style.
4.0,I love the fit and look of the ring and stones. It is a little thinner than I expected that's why the 4 star. I have gotten many compliments on it. I wear it everyday.
4.0,"Because of the other reviews, and this being an Asian seller, I bought the swimsuit 2sizes bigger then I'd normally buy with American companies. Since I'm somewhat busty I was terrified that it still wouldn't fit. But the top fits ok enough for me. The bottom I could size down, but I like the fit. The material seems a bit thin, but it's lined and the cups are molded. They come with removable &#34;cutlets&#34;. I would buy from this company again. I received the package in a timely manner."
4.0,bought for great grandson's 4th birthday and they were the hit of the party
4.0,"Loved the fabric. Not too fond of the two hoods. But other than that, great for yourself even for gift giving."
4.0,"DISCLAIMER: The color of these made a difference! I first ordered these leggings in navy blue. I absolutely love this pair - hands down one of my favorite pair of yoga pants/leggings that I own. I tend to carry weight in my tummy area, and these smooth and slim perfectly and smoothly, without creating that obvious harsh &#34;line&#34; at your waist that can be uncomfortable and that you can see thru a shirt. I loved the navy ones, so I ordered another pair in the &#34;grainy&#34; grey color. I don't know what the deal is with that, but the grey ones--mehh. The fabric of the grainy grey ones feels a good bit thinner, and doesn't offer the same control/slimming effect as the navy pair. I have no idea why this is--maybe solid colors are just sturdier. In sum, I'd give the navy pair 5/5 stars. The grey ones 3.5/5."
4.0,tHIS IS A<br />CHRISTMAS PRESENT SO NO RATING AT THIS TIME.  IT IS FOR MY GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER
4.0,"The material is soft but more like a pajama shirt material, like softer than a tshirt. I thought it was going to be more like their pants they sell (like thick spandex) and it's not. As you can tell from the picture, it's a tiny see through but nothing too bad. I was going to use this as a workout top but I have decided to use it as a sleep shirt. It's very comfortable and the sleeves are just the right length and width. I would buy it again but only if the price went down. I don't feel it's worth the price I paid for it but will keep it since it's very comfy."
4.0,"It was a little bigger than expected. But still good. Reasonably priced, and it's good quality."
4.0,"I love these leggings. They fit great and are so comfortable. TTS in my opinion! Only complaint is that they are super loose around the calf, had to roll them up to make them fitted."
4.0,"It's food, but I can't state it's reliability. YET.  They offer a ""free"" canopy, but it is ""no longer available "". Say that they will instead send a free cover, we will see."
4.0,"The bathing suit is really cute. However, the yellow one is very see through. I got in the water and my boyfriend had to cover me because you could see EVERYTHING! Maybe it was the color, since its light..."
4.0,"Best value for hat sizing tape that I found on Amazon. Works well. Removing the backing tape from this product, like many, is difficult but can be done (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars). Once removed, the tape is easy to insert in the hat brim and it works. You get a lot for your money here.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there is a good solution for developing a product that is a bit easier to use, so I recommend buying this one."
4.0,These are great for the price. They do fit me a but high waisted and the seam down the back is mildly annoying which is why i only give 4 stars
4.0,I purchased these for my son for Nature‚Äôs Classroom. They worked out great for him! Super easy to take on and off. Also wore them to an sporting event in the pouring rain and he said his feet were dry. I only gave them 4 stars because we have only had them for a short time. Will update once they have more use. And a great price!
4.0,"Fits a little oddly, but great quality and pricing!"
4.0,The shirt was shorter than I thought it would be.
4.0,It is cute but It is very short. It did not look like it would be that short on the legs in d picture
4.0,"Not a huge fan of the material. It does that thing where it gets white when it‚Äôs stretched in places, which is a bummer. Other than that they are as advertised."
4.0,"Great piece! Hope my thoughts below help someone who's on the fence about this item.<br /><br />Sizing:<br />I am 5'7&#34; and 135 lbs. My measurements matched up with a Medium on the provided sizing guide, but I ended up keeping a Large. Would go one size up from what the chart says, unless you like your clothes skin tight.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Versatile; I LOVE how easy it is to dress this up or down.<br />- Fashionable; Ribbed fabric adds great texture to an outfit.<br />- Acceptable length for tall ladies; It's hard to find dresses that don't nearly show your booty when you're over 5'7&#34;. This one has you covered!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Unforgiving; Why is this called a &#34;bodycon&#34; dress? You aren't going to con anyone with this design, since it shows every bump and bulge. Heh. Nonetheless, I knew this dress would be form-fitting, and think the cut is great!<br />- A bit immodest, especially if you have curves. However, it's easy to make this item more seemly through layering (examples in photos).<br />- Fabric is pretty thin"
4.0,Bought this for a 1 year old's birthday gift and the 3T barely fit. Excellent quality.
4.0,"Dress matches color/pattern advertised. It‚Äôs  a bit snug in the chest, however not uncomfortable. This could be due to bust size (I am a 36ddd) as the rest of the dress is true to size.<br />It‚Äôs a lighter material so it‚Äôs a great dress for spring or summer. Throw on some leggings under it and would also be great for the fall weather."
4.0,Every good classy watch
4.0,LOVE the dress but had to return because it was too big. Great quality though
4.0,"This was a nice, light weight carry-on. I had to gate check and it did not survive. United agent said it was likely tossed and landed on the top corner, which was crushed. Great piece if kept in your control. Do not check!"
4.0,This purchase was because I like this item.  I have a prior purchase of this same item.
4.0,I love this headband. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did not receive the headband pictured. I received a green plaid one.
4.0,"I like how both styles feel around my finger. The silicon is so soft I forget that I'm wearing a ring. I used these when I exercise. My only reason for the 4/5 is because the colors look a little weird with my skin, so I normally will just wear the dark bands."
4.0,"It's a bit tighter than I usually like, but I can still wear it.The material is a little itchy, but tolerable."
4.0,"Cute dress, but doesn't give the body shape."
4.0,its sturdy and durable BUT the clip of the govo card holder took the paint on the hook of the clip off so now its not black.
4.0,"I love the cut and colour of this suit. One thing about this one-piece is it does run small. I usually wear a small/medium, but ordered a large and I'm happy I did. If you're thinking about ordering this bathing suit, I would recommend it, but I would suggest ordering a size or two bigger than you typically might."
4.0,As expected. Good deal for 5 sets of readers that are a lot more durable than the cheapo ones I've been buying at the supermarket or drugstore.
4.0,Sterling silver in the green stone
4.0,"Thinner material than i was expecting, but still nice."
4.0,This is not the bag that I received. The picture is a croc pattern design and I received a plain  black design with no pattern. But the bag is very nice over all.
4.0,put these on top of Christmas gifts for grandparents with a picture of there grand baby :) they loved it! seems durable so far!
4.0,"These sandals appear to be no longer available.  I'm submitting my review in case they comes back.<br /><br />  Sizing. Order the next size down if you are between sizes, even if you are almost the next size up. The product page advises that you should order the next size down if you are a half size. I ordered these for my wife and ordered a size 8 because she is a 7 and 3/4 and takes a size 8 about half the time. She finds that the sandals are a bit big.<br /><br />  These sandals definitely offer arch support ‚Ä¶ perhaps too much arch support.<br /><br />  My wife reports her feet have mostly adjusted to the pronounced hump in the sole of the sandals, but not entirely. She also says that the between-the-toes strap rubs a bit but is optimistic that this may resolve as she breaks them in."
4.0,"I thought the necklace would be black, but it is rainbow. I am fine with it. Otherwise it is AWESOME."
4.0,Nice coat but it was 2 small so igave it to my son
4.0,"The brim was very floppy so glued black facing on under the brim, added a better feather, and trimmed the top to more of a point.  Now it‚Äôs great!  Very sturdy."
4.0,These are just what I wanted just a where the nose part is is kinda small
4.0,"It's a good-looking shirt. I really like it. The only complaints would be...<br />- it fits tight around the chest<br />- it's really long (great if you're going to tuck it in though!)<br />- the neck is pretty large for how tight the torso is. Great for when I want to wear a tie with it, but a little less-than-desireable when wearing it open. It's just a really big opening.<br />- It wrinkles REALLY BAD in the dryer. A good ironing fixes it, but there's no way I could get away with wearing it without ironing it first."
4.0,"It's true to its size. Definitely check the sleeve length if you want to order a size up. I ordered a size up so it can fit layers underneath. The sleeves are loose as expected, but they covered my hands."
4.0,The quality of the dress is really good. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs actually a bit wider than expected. Especially the sleeves. I usually wear a small or medium depending on the style. But in this case it seems like a small would fit better. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 145lb with bust 35C
4.0,No issues ... this is a Christmas gift.
4.0,Thank you!!!  Perfect
4.0,"It is nice enough to break away from the look of traditional pearls from time to time (Pearls are my normal 'go to' jewelry of choice).  I thought it would be a little more sparkly, especially since  there is more metal than pearls.  However, it is a good weight and lays in a classy way.  One star is deducted for some of the links not being finished and smooth.  I would not wear this on top of a satin or silk blouse."
4.0,Looks like what was ordered. Top is good quality. Bottoms are snug and hopefully won‚Äôt rip. Love the accessories
4.0,Packaging was not good. Hat was crushed. Once I steamed it and worked out the wrinkles the hat is really cute and well made.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful. I bought this in 10 and another one by Ever Pretty [[ASIN:B07C76RH5V Ever-Pretty Women Lace Elegant 3/4 Sleeve Empire Waist Maxi Bridesmaid Dresses US 08 Navy Blue]] in 8. The dresses are very similar, but a 10 in this fit me tighter than the 8 in the other one. I ended up wearing the other one to a wedding, and will be returning this. It's also not as soft as the other, but the scoop shoulders and the deeper v cut back looks incredibly gorgeous!"
4.0,My great Grandaughter loves these
4.0,"This dress loses a star because I'm returning it. It is amazing though! Cute, flattering and good quality. I am 5'5 115 lbs and 32DDD. I ordered a Small and the top portion just didn't work with my chest, gaping at the armpits. Length, pockets and style are on point though. Definitely still recommend!!"
4.0,The skirt is beautiful how ever the lining is very bad you will need to replace it .
4.0,Nice rocks to paint. You do have to wash off the dust.
4.0,"Love these glasses, love the polarized lens. A tad crooked, but still great for the price."
4.0,I like this shirt dress a lot I ordered an xl I wear a size 13/15 the only reason I gave four stars is because of the material it's like a stretchy material would have been better if it was different it's also a little on the thin side but for the price it's great I'm gonna wear it with chucks
4.0,My nephews love these sunglasses.  They call them there &#34;cool&#34; glasses.  My nephew is 5 and these fit just find.  I would def buy them again in the bright colors.  And to be realistic that will probably next summer when they lose them.'
4.0,"This is super comfy, very soft. I am usually an XL, but glad I ordered a 2XL. Plenty of room, great length for leggings."
4.0,"Like other reviews suggest, you need to briefly iron it into shape. As soon as my mum saw it she wanted to have one for herself. It truly is a very beautiful and sparkly piece of jewellery. I'm in the process of working out a way to transplant the pendant onto another chain for longevity. If you like small, simple and dainty everyday pieces you will not regret purchasing this."
4.0,Colour more burgundy than brown and not as bid as expected.  Otherwise pretty earrings. Had to return and that was easy too.
4.0,Bought for a co-worker. Colors are true to what picture says. Its lovely and fit great. Will be buying more!
4.0,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars.  These are awesome.  Great quality great materials great feel and great look!<br /><br /> The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because the pouch is too small.<br /><br />These underwear have a pouch up front you put your junk into.<br /><br />I have an average size penis I would say,  but I have been told I have big balls.<br /><br />It is a bit of a tight fight but still incredibly comfortable."
4.0,For an aun
4.0,"Thought it included the inner pillow but just the cover. Maybe my mistake. Easy enough to get an insert. No worries, grandson gonna love it!"
4.0,Love it works efficiently
4.0,LOVE this necklace!  Super cute and I like how it hangs the same due to how it hooks in the back.  I was worried it would pull tight around the neck but it doesnt.
4.0,"Love them, just wished they were a little bigger.  But that is the luck of draw with these bracelets, I own several sets and you never know if you will have room to spare or feel like you are putting a girdle on your wrist. The colors are fabulous!"
4.0,"Comfortable and warm. I'm saving these for winter. They are good quality, just not as soft as I'd expected (hence, I took away a star). I suspect they'll soften on washing. I like the color, a dark grey with some red and blue lines that are very thin. Soothing design. Look classy."
4.0,Works well for travel - better if a little smaller.
4.0,"This was a beautiful watch. Very well crafted and attractive. However, I had to return it. The watch face is HUGE (like larger than a silver dollar) and covered the entire top of my wrist. Because of the metal mesh band, there was no way for me to add another hole because it is a bit heavy and would never have stayed snugly in place. If you are petite like me, this is not the watch for you. I also worried that because of it's size I'd be more likely to knock it against something and break it. Still, if you have a bigger wrist and are looking for something special, I'd still recommend this watch - it really is nice. Just not for me."
4.0,Could be a little more sturdier
4.0,Nice item. As described
4.0,"I can‚Äôt complain, it‚Äôs a great boot for the price. Kept my feet warm and dry during the cold month and a half."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. The fabric is nice and flowy and not too thin or see-through. However, the dress does need ironing. I wash mine in cold water on a delicate setting and air dry. The fit wasn't very curvy, so I sewed in some darts on both the back and front, so the fabric didn't bunch up when tying the wrap. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 135 lbs. My measurements are 34, 28, 36, so I needed the waist to be more fitted. With the modifications, this dress has become one of my favorites. Great product for the price."
4.0,"Sturdy, well-made case."
4.0,everything came and looked as expected. very comfortable and fits to size.
4.0,A hole lot bigger than I expected. But nice quality. Not practical for small pocket watches.
4.0,"This dress runs small so order the next size up. I always wear 4/small. But for this I had to return and get  a medium, which is still quite snug. It is a nice dress and I got lots of compliments. The sleeves are a little short-as if it‚Äôs a petite, but not overly noticeable."
4.0,Good for the price. It runs small
4.0,This dress is good for spring and summer
4.0,"It's warm, comfortable BUT it smells -- literally. I believe they must heat their work places with kerosene wherever this is made, because the odor is so intense that I have tried every conceivable spray, fabric softener sheets, perfumes, but the odor continues to linger on. If I can get beyond that problem, I believe it will be a perfect heavy sweater to wear in my car while I drive."
4.0,Nice but the material is thin
4.0,"These socks won't come off your feet, big thumbs up for that. Only issue is these are not 100% invisible. If not I would have given them a 5 star.<br /><br />Overall recommended."
4.0,Nice but run large.
4.0,Daughter's happy with earrings.
4.0,"I ordered these for my son, who just wanted a fake pair of reading glasses. They came quickly and he loves them. They do sit a little bit funny on the bridge of his nose, though. On a grown up, they would be pretty small."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, got tons of compliments. The Navy blue is a beautiful color. It fit my curves just right. I'm a size 14, and have a terrible belly gut and this dress covered it well but I did have to get a 2x in order for it not to such to tightly."
4.0,I took a chance and ordered this and Im very pleased with this swimsuit for $6 its a great buy. It fit great and is made well
4.0,"Not very much padding, does not seem to help much."
4.0,Wash up great
4.0,Great for the price. Good quality
4.0,Masks are very shiny and stay on well. The sequins start to ComeOff after a while though
4.0,Pretty good beanie for a great price !
4.0,Very beautiful dress! Ran a bit small so I ended up giving it to my mother.
4.0,"They were bigger than I thought they would be, I still like the varying colors and how easy they are to put on. After a while they begin to get sore like any clip on earring, but they are very pretty and came a lot earlier than anticipated. I will definitely consider buying more products of the same type from this company."
4.0,Bought for my daughter to get ready in before her wedding.  Was very satisfied with the quality.
4.0,This gives added confidence when you've torn your ear and need an earring lift. Helps you feel confident about not loosing your earrings.
4.0,"Beautiful coat, could not work buttons. If it had a zipper like most raincoats would have been perfect."
4.0,Dress is very cute and flattering. Material isn‚Äôt great but what I expected for the price. SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than I expected. Still pretty but not the length I‚Äôd had in mind.
4.0,great to slip on after a shower esp on a hot day. I could easily wear it &#34;out&#34; with a shawl or cardigan sweater.
4.0,These are thin and the zippers break easily but very handy .
4.0,I ordered a large should have ordered a medium or small.
4.0,"I have had a black one and a white one of thesehad for three years. The color, fabric, and stitching have held up very well. I feel most comfortable in size XL for sleeping (I am 5/8 and 170 lb, 39""-30""-39""). If you want a more snug fit then you might not want it as loose as I like it. It should always be washed in warm or cold water and NEVER placed into the dryer. Even though the information with the product says they are made of 100% cotton, it seems that they are some sort of cotton rayon blend by feel. Unless you're buying a dark color, you're going to be able to see  through this thing."
4.0,"Love the frame. Fits well. Looks great & sturdiness.  It‚Äôs a bit heavy for me but overall, it‚Äôs fantastic. It enhanced my vision while driving."
4.0,Very nice but wear spanx underneath
4.0,"First of all, this little foam device works. It reminds me of the little similar shaped floaties you can get for your keys. I put it on my sunglasses and put them in a deep bowl of water and they stayed right at the surface. The yellow color should be easy to spot in the ocean. The only thing is, it looks kind of nerdy. In the product info, they say the style of glasses holder that goes around your neck is nerdy and claim the G Float is better. The neck ones are no where near as noticeable as having a yellow pillow on the side of your glasses though! Still, I'd rather look a little nerdy out on the water than lose prescription sunglasses. Plus I got this for my husband anyway, so he'll be the one looking nerdy on vacation :-)"
4.0,Good shoes for my 3rd grade son.
4.0,The top ball broke in half after about a month and a half of wear. Ball from another piece of jewelry fits on just fine though! So happy I can still wear my alien.
4.0,"Nice shirt for the most part,Velcro loop is smaller than it should be but works well. Material is stiff but will soften over time. I‚Äôve only washed it twice but am concerned the tan Camo is turning an orange color. My boy uses it for airsoft and he is aggressive wonder how long it is going to holdup had to sew on It after first outing<br />  Ok we have had this shirt for a while now and it has held up to repeated washing‚Äôs and a lot of wear and abuse yet still looks like new. The color stayed great and all the Velcro works like new. He is growing out of this one so definatly buying a larger size from this supplier great product 5 stars plus"
4.0,They do what they are supposed to. &#34;I love it&#34; just seems like an odd description for some glove clips.
4.0,The ‚Äúlace‚Äù around the neck is super stiff but it fit me and the lace by the hands is softer. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it anywhere other than for a costume but for the price that‚Äôs fine.
4.0,"Soft, 100% Cotton in a soft jersey.<br /><br />Nice wide tank top with a round neckline. Has two front, side pockets and a tunnel waistband with a drawstring.<br /><br />Pull-on style with a slit and button in the back neck. One piece that fit loosely, very casual and comfortable"
4.0,Loved it for my daughter but just a tiny bit smaller than expected.
4.0,These boots are perfect! Arrived timely as well
4.0,The arms a little small for me.
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt order an XS.  I ordered a small.  Didn‚Äôt realize I had the wrong size before I wore it.  It is very snug in the chest.  I also didn‚Äôt know that it would be so light weight.  The one I had before was  a little heavier.  Other than that, I like it."
4.0,"These boots are my everything. ha<br />I love them and wear them so much, they fit some what small but not uncomfortable small. I can still wear and walk comfortably in them."
4.0,The black coating is coming off quickly but perfectly functional.
4.0,Bought them for a homeless shelter.  They seem to be good.
4.0,They are very comfortable but I do wish the waist was a little higher.  Good workout capris.
4.0,Excellent warm hoodie- great for winter. More like a sweatshirt than a thinner fashion hoodie. Color is quite a bit brighter than pictured- I like the real color better than the one in the picture.
4.0,Really like the shirt and would buy again. Runs slightly large but worth the buy! Recommend it as I have 2 colors in this shirt. Very comfortable!
4.0,Took a bit to arrive but ok quality
4.0,"I love them, they‚Äôre warm and cozy. I wear them daily. I have washed them once and they held up!<br /><br />If I had any complaint, it would be the foam goes flat, but that was expected."
4.0,"Too big for me,but cute"
4.0,Bought these glasses twice. First time I broke them and I was so upset because I loved the colors. The price was decent enough I decided to get a second pair. How did they break you may ask? I felt like they were too straight across my face and I was trying to bend them to make them curve slightly. The frame just couldn‚Äôt take the bending I shouldn‚Äôt have been doing. The quality is decent: metal frame and good color lenses
4.0,Skirt was perfect !  As described and it fit as expected.
4.0,The watch head is copper and was advertised as gold.
4.0,"Never had a chance to test quality or accuracy of the watch. Watch arrived with dead battery. Not a good beginning. UPDATE... Company did their best to rectify my disappointment by offering a full no charge replacement watch. Changed my rating from1star to 4 stars because of the fast, sincere and exceptional customer service actions."
4.0,"Went back and forth for a while before buying these because I wasn‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôd be worth the 20 ish dollars. I‚Äôm glad I bought them!! Super cute and easy to wear, you can wear them more high waisted or pull them down for a longer look. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 160 lbs postpartum and it‚Äôs hard finding clothes that fit. The large fits perfectly!<br />1. The only two cons: they get really wrinkly after you wash them and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre iron safe?<br />2. The elastic in the waist band easily flips when you pull them up, so you have to constantly fix and straighten the elastic band."
4.0,it is beautiful  but it runs smaller than I thought.
4.0,"A nice fit, rain & wind proof, keeps me warm and light weight"
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, fits great! I only gave 4 stars because it doesn't come with a belt or anything to tie around the elastic part of the waist."
4.0,Love everything other than the fit<br />After a few uses the cap is becoming a little loose<br />May be my head is shrinking. ü§î
4.0,"Love this distressed soft leather bag!  I would recommend this to anyone. Only 2 drawbacks (but fixable). There is a zippered compartment in the middle of the bag. It is nice for things that normally would slide around loose, but this compartment counteracts overall space inside the bag, and I have put serious thought to cutting this out.  The other issue is that there is not a lock on the bag but has these leather straps that slide through conchs, so I took a leather punch and made 2 holes(1 inch apart in the end of the leather strap). I can use a basic luggage lock through the punch holes to ‚Äúlock‚Äù the bag."
4.0,"It is flattering although a tiny bit loose in chest area (I‚Äôm a 38c). I used a safety pin to secure it & it works fine. Sleeves fit well and are not tight, knee length is what I prefer. My only slight downside is the fabric is thinner but not see through."
4.0,"I‚Äôm a 34B and the bust on the suit, though padded, seems better suited for someone with a larger chest/bust. The fit everywhere else is great, but not as flattering as I‚Äôd hope for a smaller-chested gal like me."
4.0,"I love this hoodie and wear it quite often on chilly mornings. It's a little tighter than I'd like and not quite ""plus size"" proportionate. Washes well and remains soft."
4.0,Good yoga short - my husband loves them for hot yoga.  He is 6'1&#34; 208 lbs and purchased a medium... fits great but he would not have know to by a medium without reading the reviews
4.0,"I love this outfit to wear at home. I thought it will be good to wear when out, but I believe they show underwear depending on your choice. But I love wearing them at home. They are comfortable and fabric is ok for home"
4.0,"was difficult to tell from the picture where it would fall on the leg - hit me at about the knee which is fine, but at my age I was hoping for a little longer.  Nice dress for the price though."
4.0,"Great variety , good deal,"
4.0,"I usually wear small, but I ordered a medium because the shirt is not stretchy, and I did not want it to be too tight.  Without a manufacturer's size chart it was not easy to decide what I need.  It fits OK.  I should have bought a small, as usually, but decided not to exchange because it's an informal summer shirt, and loose fit does not make it look bad.  The quality is very good, and I like the design.  I am thinking about buying another color in my normal size."
4.0,"Love these, very comfortable and sexy."
4.0,It took a little while to get here but once I received it and took it out of the packaging it was nice.  My husband saw it and he said it was nice and believe me if it looked like cheap trash he would have told me!  Good investement for a very small price.
4.0,Great value and fit. Only 4 stars b/c the lenses are a little blurry kinda like looking through oily lenses that need to be cleaned. I will buy these again.
4.0,"Great coat!  I would suggest sizing up.  A size 10/12 fits my son perfectly, but he has a pretty slim build."
4.0,I like it. It‚Äôs pretty. And it fits well. The monochromatic decoration is not garish
4.0,I was able to adjust it myself easily and it works great
4.0,Nice material - heavier-dutier than expected!
4.0,"Fits good and true to description.  It is tight on me though, so I will most likely wear it as an under shirt until I lose a little more weight :)"
4.0,"I bought these chickens so I can keep track of USB flash drives at work, its harder to lose when you slap a chicken on it. The rubber keeps them in your pocket, if you slide something else out, the flash drive wont go with it. It's odd enough that it appears out of place and it easy to spot if you put it down and forget. And the very fact that they are chickens somehow makes it less common for me to forget them. My only problem is they can snap off the keyring and you need to replace them."
4.0,"Good feel, open weave linen. But the color is very much lighter grey than the picture!"
4.0,"I am 4' 10"" and 115 pounds and usually like to wear mediums, as I like my clothing to be on the loose side. I ordered this in a small and found it to be larger than expected. It is a comfortable shirt and I love the green color so will likely try wearing it with a tie knot or just around my home."
4.0,"Shirt is super short, I ordered a size up and still super small but still cute"
4.0,Nice belt. It fit but kept moving up because there were no belt loops on the pantsuit.
4.0,Not quite as ‚Äú oversized‚Äù!as I had hoped for. They are nice glasses though for the price.
4.0,way cheaper than the clam-shell clasps i needed to replace.
4.0,Good size. They go nicely with a necklace I had purchased.
4.0,"I love this shirt but it was very small. I am a 34 DDD, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 160lbs and it fit my boobs but the arms were so small! Not enough to be uncomfortable but super tiny. If you are curvy, I‚Äôd order a size up or two."
4.0,"Frankly, for the price this is a great deal.<br /><br />Fyi, though, the white undershirt is NOT included. This is a completely see-through, flouncy top that's pretty but not exactly what I was expecting. It's really, surprisingly well-made and feels quite nice both in my hands and on me, but this top in my size is not full enough to hang past my hips as shown in the pictures. It's still very nice and looks pretty good on me with my skate gear, but I am disappointed it doesn't hang fuller.<br />Overall, I would recommend, but perhaps if you want it to hang low like the pictures and you have wide hips like me, get a size bigger."
4.0,Great for the price. Had to do some adjusting to the metal as they were quite tight for my little guy. I tried them on and they really did cut out a lot of sound. Super handy for his first outdoor concert!
4.0,"I bought the white shirt as a gift, and they loved the design. However the white shirt was very thin cotton, and ran a little small. I would consider  reordering this in a different color though."
4.0,"I know these aren't meant to be top-notch quality... but I ordered two and neither of the chains are connected like pictured.  It's two separate pieces connected to a center jump ring.<br /><br />Also, one came broken (the chain).  Easy fix, I suppose... but a person buying something brand new isn't looking to FIX their received item, fresh out of the packaging, you know??<br /><br />I get it, cheap for cheap... I genuinely only wanted the charms themselves. Anyhow, those (the charms) are pretty true to picture and kah-yoot. ^_^<br /><br />Overall, I'd have given it 5 stars had everything been received intact... but not the case.  I like 'em though, decent product for the value."
4.0,Overs all love! Just a little loose around waist! And super long
4.0,"The fabric is very thin but the tee shirt was inexpensive.  I bought it for my granddaughter because of the words on it, she just broke up with her boyfriend.  I give it 4 stars because it met my expectations for being a funny gift."
4.0,"I'm a size 26, so i assumed most cami's are small. but this, as expected is a tad small, but it doesn't roll up. I am big busted though, so its shorter on the front than on the back. ( but still good length)"
4.0,Very cute runs small. Bought medium. Fits like a small.
4.0,"They were okay, to shiny"
4.0,Decent quality pair of sweat pants and fit as advertised.
4.0,My granddaughter wanted an initial necklace in gold and this was the perfect choice. The initial is printed in a script font which gives it feminine style which she loves. A really cute necklace without breaking the bank.
4.0,It's beautiful. big enough. love it. I am happy I got it.  You will be happy if you get it.
4.0,Wedding goft
4.0,This band is comfortable. Great for working out. If you get the black band then color is great. Bought the blue and one side is blue and other side is black. The same with grey. Just didn't get the color right all the way around.
4.0,I love the fit and the style and the color.
4.0,Satisfies my requirement when doing chores outside during the winter.
4.0,I gave this to a friend for her birthday.  It looks beautiful on her. I am buying another one for myself.
4.0,"Very comfortable socks, hold up well so far, although much of the Star Wars design (which is the whole point to these) is hidden when you wear pants!"
4.0,Very cute and the band is comfortable.
4.0,"I'm a size small and recieved a medium, but thankfully I know how to alter my clothes and can fix the size. It's a little baggy, but I think the pants look fine. I just needed to find tune the waist size because they were WAY too big for me at first. Make sure to double check the sizing chart and make sure you get the size you ordered. Otherwise, it's great."
4.0,"I like these shoes. They take a bit to get used to, but are different than the norm. I hadn‚Äôt seen any like them and have grown to love them. Broke in fairly quickly and are very comfortable after a few wears."
4.0,It's super tight and compressing. It's very formfitting as well. I wouldn't wear it alone because it's see through as well. It's great to wear underneath clothing.
4.0,"This is a cute set. It is thin material and I‚Äôm a curvy 16plus in clothes, with hips and butt. I ordered a XXL. The top fit good much like the xl hoodie I buy, however the bottoms were more fitted but not too tight. It‚Äôs a keeper"
4.0,Granted you get what you pay for but it is probably only best for a one time wear unless you're very gentle on the chains.
4.0,"Got exactly what I expected.<br />Protective packaging, easy installation, good fit and quality.<br />Very satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,"Great shopping bag, just wish it had a zippered pouch for my keys"
4.0,Love it but runs just a tad too short. Wish I could have bought my husband a tall size (which we rarely ever have to order).
4.0,"Very cute. I like it a lot. Don't care much for the white string. It needs a leather one like the leather near the pockets. But, I just pulled it out."
4.0,It‚Äôs a lil less give than I was expecting but it‚Äôsa pretty top and lightweight material
4.0,Very nice but very big for an average four year old.
4.0,love the shirt and fabric.  It is just way too short
4.0,It‚Äôs nice... hurts after a while (like an hr after) from the magnetic pressure but I like as a substitute since I don‚Äôt want the real piercing
4.0,"I like the look of it, but the production, fabric, and quality are just meh."
4.0,These are gorgeous. Only reason for 4 star slow shipping and could be better packaged. But the item it's self perfect!
4.0,A little hard to stuff the bills it. Was afraid i might end up tearing a few. BUT it kept me from blowing ALL my money at the casino!
4.0,"I love these skirts. They ride up a bit, but the fabric is soft and comfortable."
4.0,I adored the shorts but my only issue is the riding up which can be annoying at times. Great overall
4.0,I purchased this mask for my daughter to wear on vacation. It has come in handy since she‚Äôs returned to school. The only concern I have is the beads that come to adjust the ear loops. We lost one on the first wear and now have to tie a knot in them.
4.0,"I ordered this in anticipation of needing it, but I have not used it yet so I'm not comfortable giving 5 stars even though I anticipate no problems and found no flaws.  When I tried it on, it was comfortable and a nice size, although for me as a small person with short hair it was a little larger than I needed.  It definitely seemed as though it will keep my head and face warm the next time I have to shovel snow in the wind.  I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,They turn yellow quite fast. Better then wearing safety glasses over my glasses.
4.0,"I love the size of this backpack. I bought it for a three day festival and it is just what I expected. The straps did not come with the snap to make them long or short like they do in other people's review pictures. They do adjust almost just like any other normal straps. The only difference is that you have to pull UP to tighten instead of down. The straps are more pink than the red of the backpack, but not too bad."
4.0,"Very nice, but runs smaller"
4.0,"The actual stays are decent in quality.  They are by no means top of the line, but they are still much better than the cheap plastic collar stays.  The carrying case should not be a selling a point.  The product comes in a cheap plastic box that is better than nothing, but most certainly not worth bragging about.  Overall, this is a good product.  There is no reason to break the bank over something that is hidden inside your shirt."
4.0,Pretty but chain is too Long
4.0,The only thing I don't like about this slipper is that it stretched on me so now I have to push my feet pass the toe to keep them on
4.0,Pretty chiffon shirt.  Not see through.  But runs  small.  Order next size up.  Fits at chest.  Too small at waist and hip.
4.0,Really small and Ripped easily
4.0,"Nice jacket but was way too small as a XXL.  Unfortunately, I had to return."
4.0,Love it but was just a bit big for me.
4.0,"Cute shoes and fast shipping. The only problem is that the heel area comes up super high and gave me terrible blisters when I went on a short 1 mile walk in them. Very stylish, but really only good for light use and aesthetics."
4.0,The watch is very nice setup was a bit tricky but manageable the band I‚Äôm not crazy about as the buckle sits higher up on the wrist instead of below and in the middle
4.0,I got 7 pairs and all except 1 pair fit great.
4.0,"Using on a Jackson Big Tuna.  The kayak is heavy, about 120-140 with chairs and gear. Having trouble with the cart shifting.  The vertical bars do not stay aligned due to the cross member slipping.  It causes the wheels to get out of line.  I think my yak is just too heavy for the cart.  On pavement it works fine.  I am going to try stuffing some foam from a &#34;noodle&#34; in the scupper holes for a tighter fit.  I think that will cure my woes or at least help.  It works far better than the cradle I tried first.  A weld at the width adjustment point would stop the shifting for sure.  Yes it would no longer be adjustable but so what.  I gave it a &#34;4&#34; because anything that can haul my beast at all is a good cart in my opinion."
4.0,Bought for my sons wedding
4.0,"This lovely blouse arrived quickly, was as described, & fit well.  Would highly recommend this vendor!"
4.0,"Brought a 4lx, it's made small"
4.0,This set is beautiful but clasp do pinch the ears if worn all day.
4.0,"This is the third pair that I've ordered.  I wore them to my mechanic's shop and he really liked them, so he asked me to order him a pair.  These glasses are awesome for the price.  My first pair scratched easily, yet I haven't had the same issue with my second pair."
4.0,Works really well. Unfortunately went up a size as per the review- still way too small!
4.0,Nice material for the price I ordered the 3 month and it looks like my baby girl will be wearing it next year.
4.0,"Blouse is a beautiful color and the detail on the sleeves and square neckline is nice. Material is soft and comfortable and this could be good for work or going out, paired with jeans, leggings, or slacks. I got the large and when it‚Äôs not tucked in, it is more of a baggy look. I hate having to iron and this blouse needs to be ironed. As soon as I received it, I hung it up and waited a few days to see if the wrinkles would work out, but they didn‚Äôt. This would be perfect if it was wash and wear but otherwise it‚Äôs still a nice blouse."
4.0,I have this in black. Heavy and durable 100meters w.p.<br />Wear it for swimming and out. Many compliments.<br />Would buy again.......
4.0,"Only problem is as the one reviewer notes, shoulders are tight and for me, hard to keep it properly closed. I realize this is a Chinese size, but for me in this case, it needs to be 2 XL. After all, robes should have lots of fabric and give the wearer his choice in whether it fits tight or looser. In my case, tight is way too tight. So very disappointed as it seems to be made well."
4.0,"very cute, but did not receive the patterns that were described. would have been better if descriptions said patterns may vary. other than that cute on my baby. also did not arrive when stated."
4.0,"Kids shoes shouldn‚Äôt be so expensive. I got these when they had prime, because I wasn‚Äôt willing to pay shipping. Also, I got this color because it was cheaper. My daughter liked them, they were comfortable and she grew out of them pretty soon"
4.0,These pants are awesome. Came on time and fits like a glove. Will be ordering more from this company
4.0,"I really love this necklace, it is elegant and sophisticated. I only wish the clasp was better, visually it makes it seem cheap, unfinished, or without proper finish on a beautiful necklace. Its a detail that could really take it up a notch. That is my suggestion to the company. Otherwise I like it."
4.0,The shirt is adorable but it was too small for a large breasts. I was bummed they didn‚Äôt have a size for me to go up in.
4.0,These glasses are too narrow at the back of the arms. I had to put cushions on the ends so they wouldn't press in too hard behind my ears. (Not made for big people). The lenses are great and the glasses look good on. Using them mostly for computer eye strain reduction which they do well.
4.0,Ordered a large. I am 5‚Äù4 and 150 lbs and the top portion fit well but the bottom half was little large. May be cute with a belt.
4.0,"Love this pendant. Gave it 4 stars because mine has minor flaws in its finish, like 2 tiny bubbles on the right wing from some sort of top coating used but overall it is very nice for casual use. It's not a tiny pendant but not huge either so when worn its noticable."
4.0,"If you have a squishy middle, the waistband will emphasize your squishiness. That aside, great product, much, much stronger and durable than I anticipated.  I did have to trim some fuzzy spots out of it but otherwise great hose."
4.0,It's a good skirt. The dye doesn't bleed and I have had no trouble with it for the year that I've had it. The shape is just as pictured.  The fabric material tends to form knotty lint balls sometimes but it doesn't seem to be because of any weakness in the actual skirt.
4.0,I love the shirt and color. I need a size larger though.
4.0,Nice and long. I will have to say the zipper itself to allow nursing access could be longer. For me it seems to be a bit too short to comfortably get my infant nursing without the sipper right there. It does work though.
4.0,Cool hat just didn't realize was a skee mask.
4.0,"Details are awesome, but the mind stone in the center of the gauntlet fell out."
4.0,"This is very pretty but quite large.  Make sure to read the measurements so you are not surprised.  Otherwise, my little girl loves it."
4.0,"I would have given these pj's five stars, but my order was for short sleeves and the product I received was sleeveless. Summer is coming, so I decided to keep them!"
4.0,"Overall, this is a nice looking wallet that is not too big and stores a lot of things. I am disappointed that the large tag only lasted a few weeks. The small writing with the girl on front doesn't make any sense, but oh well, it still looks good. But otherwise, great product!"
4.0,A beautiful piece of jewelry.
4.0,"Good watch, great price!  However, there was engraving on the back, and the description should have mentioned this.  Obviously. This doesn't really affect the quality of the watch..."
4.0,Fits nice in pocket.
4.0,"Lovely,  great price for one that looks like the very pricey designer bags."
4.0,"This dress is pretty cute. It seems a bit large and the shoulders are kind of puffy, which we could've done without but oh well. The shoes are HUGE are pretty worthless but overall the little outfit works for a cute, tacky Christmas dress."
4.0,"I ordered a L, but normally wear M. The L fits great. Be warned the material is very see-through...even nude colored under garments  may show through. I purchased to use as a swimsuit cover up, and this works perfectly for that purpose"
4.0,"I love this shirt and receive so many compliments when I wear it. The colors are really rich and are perfect for fall. It is completely sheer, so you will need to wear a camisole. I ordered according to the sizing chart (I'm typically a medium but ordered an XL) and it fit perfectly.  I am 5'10&#34;, so I'm used to shirts being too short; however,  this shirt is long enough for me to tuck into a pencil skirt or wear untucked in more of a tunic style with skinny jeans and boots. I only wish the seams were a bit stronger,  as I'm a little worried about ripping them when I'm reaching my arms out quickly.  So far so good, but I can tell they are a little flimsy.  I still think it's a great buy, though!"
4.0,"I was a bit disappointed when it came as The dress I ordered was supposed to be solid color on top with 3/4 sleeves. The dress I received is all flower print. Luckily, I do like this better."
4.0,"I bought this bag because I needed more space for all my junk! It's definitely very roomy, and the numerous compartments make it easier to stay organized. I really like the internal pockets, too, because they're ideal for keeping track of smaller items. The leather isn't silky-smooth, but it appears to be of decent quality and should hold up well. The choice of carrying options is also a great idea, although I do wish the shoulder strap could be shortened a bit more."
4.0,It felt like a high quality bra. My only problem is it felt like more of a medium impact bra for me personally. It's still a good buy though!
4.0,"1 pair came in 2 days, I‚Äôm still waiting on my second (wine hollow) pair.<br />They fit perfect other than about an inch or 2 too long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and 165 lbs. I have a muscular build. They are high in compression around the waist band, but stretchy everywhere else. The gray hollow pair that I got is squat proof.<br />I got a medium."
4.0,It is a nice touch to my Halloween costume.
4.0,"This dress looks just like in the photo and the sizing is just right. Length wise it falls just right brushing my toes but not dragging on the floor. I'm 5'4"" tall. Love that it has pockets too. The only issue is that the material is stretchy poly material and not cotton jersey, which I had hoped for. Any lumps, bumps, or bra/panty lines show through this material really easily, so to make it look great I'll need to wear shapewear underneath it. Not really what I hoped for when ordering this comfy-casual looking summer dress. But it's OK. I'll still wear it because it is very pretty and I think still worth the money. There was a bit of ""factory smell"" when I first got it but I washed and line-dried it right away and now it smells fine."
4.0,Really soft. Can fit a lot of items.
4.0,"I bought these for my niece. She‚Äôs 3yo and unfortunately the masks were too large for her, HOWEVER, they are exactly what I was looking for - comfortable around the ears and super cute. They‚Äôre just not for small kids. I bought a similar set for my nephew (he‚Äôs 7) and they fit him perfectly."
4.0,Nice quality pants. Fit my husband well.
4.0,"Its not bad at all. They do exactly what they are supposed to. The adjustable straps make them easily customized to my slightly longer legs so I don't look like I have strings in my pants all day.<br /><br />Only criticism I have is that the gripping mechanism can be flimsy, and one actually completely fell apart on me when taking them off one time. I was able to reassemble the end to continue using them, but without the time to sit there and fumble with my fingers to get it back together I would have had to purchase a new pair from a different company."
4.0,These are great for yoga or even for people who might be at risk for a fall. They have great traction on the bottom but it does take some getting used to with putting your toes into the little toes holes.
4.0,"I usually wear an XL, but with these, I ordered the XL and it was too small.  I exchanged it for an XXL and that was fine.  They don't drape quite as well as my &#34;Free to Live&#34; brand cardigan, but they're still nice!  I may order other colors."
4.0,"Nice lined swimsuit, but not the size shown.  Table said XL was 40-32, the one I received says XL (34-36)."
4.0,"Pretty bracelet, I wore it for my wedding, but it was warm and I was sweating and my wrist turned green! For the price I'm not too bothered, and we didn't notice the green until after pictures, at which point I took it off."
4.0,Update- after I posted this review the company reached out to me and provided me with another set of luggage free of charge which was very considerate of them. However I have not used it so I don't know if they will immediately break as well.<br /><br />This was one of the worst purchases. It comes in a set of three and the two larger suitcases broke first time using them. Returning.
4.0,"These pants fit well and are comfortable.  They stretch well with movement, and have two cinvenient side pockets."
4.0,"Cute dress for a very good price.This dress will need a good iron on delivery, but nothing to bad. Make sure to look at the sizing image on the products images. The dress in not in US sizes."
4.0,Bought this for my niece to wear on her Minnie themed 3rd birthday. Good quality. She looked adorable.
4.0,"Washes nicely,  but 2 buttons needed to be resewn since the strings were coming undone after wash and wear once.  Fits nicely and otherwise nice shirt  that looks professional  and cute"
4.0,They are a little bigger than expected however they are pretty comfy! I love them!
4.0,"I'm 5'8 and wear a size 11 in jeans.It fits perfect except it was too short.It stops at my ankles.I ordered an XL. The cut at the bottoms is kind of funny. It doesn't hug your ankle it kind of flares.But, I'm wearing boots so it works for me."
4.0,Nice keychain. Seems durable. Came to me a little scratched though.
4.0,Had to sew it up
4.0,Did not fit as expected.  There was no band under the ruffle as pictured. Easily returned.
4.0,"I really like it. The only problem is that my glasses fog up if I breathe through my nose while wearing it. I don't know if there is anyway to avoid it though. It's not quite as warm as I had hoped, but it beats trying to keep a scarf over the right places while riding a motorcycle."
4.0,This wasn‚Äôt bad. The color washes me out. I recommend this for women who are pale to dark.
4.0,These yoga pants are a little thinner than I was expecting. They still do a nice job of smoothing everything out and they aren't sheer at all. I also really like the patterns on the sides which are slimming. Overall I really like them I just wish they were a little bit thicker.
4.0,"Fit well, fabric ok"
4.0,"Product fits around the waist just fine, but it is a lot shorter than I thought it would be. I have a longer torso and am unable to find an underbust made by the same brand that is this good of quality. If anyone knows where I can find one, let me know."
4.0,"I use these for high-impact aerobic workouts. I also have super slippery hair and can‚Äôt ever find headbands that don‚Äôt slip. These aren‚Äôt perfect, but they are GOOD‚Äîthe adjustable width helps me keep them from sliding around. I can make it through an hour of kickboxing without these slipping back. But they are thick enough that they make my ears stick out a bit when I wear them (ugh, vanity, I know), and I wish they had some silicone grabby strips for extra hold. They are super easily machine washable, though, which is great!"
4.0,"These are perfect for fall, nights by the fire.  They are super comfortable and heavier than normal sweats.  I'm 5'5"" and They are a little long."
4.0,"It fit fine and it's the right color but it is extremely thin,  like you have to wear a shirt under it thin."
4.0,"I like it very much.  Very comfortable.  It is a bit long for a swim shirt, but I'm only 5'.1&#34;.  However, perfect for a summer skirt, especially for a beach outing, in or out of the water."
4.0,The ordered product came during or before the deliver estimated time. The tie clasp works good and bought one for myself and 4 others for gifts for my friends.
4.0,"Beautiful Beautiful Romper. I'm not giving this review 5 stars because of how difficult the top is to tie tightly. But for an additional  $8.00, I will take it to my seamstress and add elastic for the top. I'm Very Happy With This Purchase!"
4.0,Good value and variety
4.0,"This tutu is adorable! I bought it for my daughter to wear for her rainbow-themed birthday. She loved it so much she wanted to wear it every day! The picture is accurate. The size seemed a little small, but it still fit. The only disappointing thing about this tutu was that it didn't have a lining and the different colors weren't sewn together, so my daughter needed to wear shorts underneath it."
4.0,a bit small but most swimwear is
4.0,Very warm yet not bulky. Touch works like its said. Only bad part is it runs a little big.
4.0,"After viewing this sweater I ordered it. I knew I would change the buttons when I saw the black ones but that's ok. Wanted it a bit nicer button. I did think it was going to be at waist length but covers farther down then expected.  After reading the reviews I ordered a medium instead of a large,vso glad I did. Large would have been way too big. I like larger fit, I'm generally a 10-12. But the large would have been overwhelming."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt like how it fit :-(
4.0,"Very nice just as advertised. Look closely at the pitchers, chain has rather large links."
4.0,I like it üíï
4.0,Shirt is comfortable and fits well . The lettering has not come off after many washing and the colors didn't fade.
4.0,"The material was as described in other reviews. Casual, thin material but able to dress it up. The fit is nice, high waisted and hangs to the ground on me, I'm 5'2 1/2"" tall."
4.0,Earrings look good and are very easy to put on. Open and click! Its that easy. It does not look fancy but if you want something that looks a little different then this is a good option for you.
4.0,Its a little smaller then I wanted but it hold alot.
4.0,"The earrings are smaller and more delicate than I expected, but I was pleased by that, and I love the shape of them. As I chose the &#34;random mixed color&#34; selection, I wasn't quite sure what to expect...the bead colors are a bit more random than I prefer, meaning the two earrings do not come close to matching. I would not have purchased these if I had seen them in a store. Still, they are  interesting and will go with a number of outfits, plus I've received compliments when wearing them."
4.0,"I absolutely love Korsis dresses.  I got one as a gift for my birthday and have ordered several since.  I have never been a dress girl, but wear at least 2 Korsis dresses a week now. They are good for casual, dress up, work, weekends, etc.....<br />In the summer I wore these with cute flip flop sandals, and now as we approach cold weather, I wear with sneakers & boots.<br />Buy some...you wont be sorry!"
4.0,I saw another review that said don‚Äôt get a bright color and white together but I really needed the white and the pink matched my other bathing suit so I took the chance. The pink bled into the white and I‚Äôm REALLY hoping it comes out for our trip we‚Äôre just about to take. I like the fit but I need to try them on with the bathing suit to really know the sheerness and look with a suit on.
4.0,I typically wear a medium to large in dancewear. I've never tried this brand before so I read reviews and decided to try a size large. It's too large on me.. may not look it but feels overy spacey on my waistline and bust. I am 5'6 and 120lbs with a curvy figure. I was going to return because it came too late to use (thanks Amazon) and return in time for new order. I'm keeping it because it is pretty and love the lace detail. The inner seam wouldn't tuck in so you can see it.. like all the time which is annoying for me. Really annoying. Other than that I will likely try other outfits from company in the future.
4.0,Fits good the top part that goes around shoulders doesn't stay in place but the rest is good
4.0,"This is a wonderful piece of jewelry! It looks really great and it has some nice things like the adjustable string. I really love this product - its very stylish and even a little discrete. I only gave this 4 stars because of one major issue: wear. I've only had this for about a month and there are way too many scratches on it - and they change the texture of it and makes it look bad. I've only had it on for really general usage - nothing that should have scratched it so it isn't the most durable. As for other's saying the string comes loose, that has not been a problem for me. Also, just to note, the picture looks like the pendant is beveled out (looks like its bulging out) when in reality, its beveled slightly in. Also, the metal is a brushed metal, not a solid color metal. But don't worry, I think it looks better than its picture!"
4.0,"I was concerned about the length.  They are perfect, I'm 5'10&#34; and it drags a little on the ground in flats."
4.0,Cute and great price. I feel that it was a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,I bought these to give as a gift and was slightly let down to find that the quality and size weren't as I'd hoped.
4.0,"We got this dress as a low-key October outfit and it was excellent as such: the kitties are sweet and subtle. Fits our small two-year old great and seems very comfortable to her. I docked a star because I thought the base color was white, but it‚Äôs actually grey. Not a big deal because‚Äîhey, perfect for October‚Äîbut I was expecting a white or off-white background."
4.0,It‚Äôs my new favorite accessorie! The chain has rubbed off a bit but the bar has managed to stay beautifully.
4.0,"I ordered the smallest size (size 4), I think it was. I did have to purposely shrink the dress in the wash to get it to fit better but that's prob because I'm a bit short. The pic here is before I shrank it and got it to fit much more nicely. Also I'm only wearing a sports bra in the pic but once I put a regular one on, it looked much nicer as well. Considering the price, it was GREAT deal! Material is thick. To reference, I'm 5'2"" and 143 lbs."
4.0,Very sheer and thin material. Lighter than tights but stays up.
4.0,"Super cute, comfy yet runs a little small"
4.0,Enjoy the shirt and how well it actually did fit.
4.0,"I love that this athletic, dry-fit shirt comes in a bag. This is perfect for keeping in my backpack as an extra shirt when going outdoors. I like the fabric and the overall fit, but I just wish that it was a little longer. This isn't usually a problem that I have with athletic tops, but this just fits a little shorter. Otherwise, it seems true to size everywhere else. Great quality."
4.0,I was very satisfied with these
4.0,"I was expecting it to be longer, but I still like it."
4.0,Bought this for a buddy of mine - he likes it so I got that going for me.
4.0,Cute. Functional and a great price. I love the mirrored look of the glasses.
4.0,Very beautiful and fits
4.0,Loved the shirt. I'm really a big<br />Clemson fan...but I accidentally<br />Put it in the dryer. Big mistake<br />For this soft cotton tee. I'm so<br />Disappointed. It is NOT a pre-<br />Shrunk t-shirt. My large turned<br />Into a small. Also up your size<br />At least by the next size up.
4.0,"Thank you it arrived earlier than expected which was a surprise for me. but now i wished I had order a size 6 instead of a size 5 which only fits my left ring finger, not on my right. overall its a good size ring, a bit heavy, the band part is thick which i like, so I've been looking for one that is similar to the one i have and this one is very close to it..."
4.0,It is a good fit for the most part but it does not cover all of my butt which might lead to wedgies lol so far so good after wearing them few times :)
4.0,They arrived.
4.0,different design than what is in stores. Daughter likes it
4.0,"This is not my first gater and I enjoy the mant straps, but i prefer the metal clips that are more common. These are a bit rough on the back and at times dig into your skin. Other than that it is a really nice garter belt. soft material and good quality."
4.0,"Love it. Worn for a girls dinner and an interview, just changed the jewelry!"
4.0,Love these socks.  Just wish they came up a little bit higher. The bottom is more like a sock than stocking which is great because they probably won‚Äôt run.
4.0,Very nice looked great but broke several times on me while at an event..luckily i was able to keep fixing it
4.0,"I am wearing this over a red pencil skirt for a more dramatic boho look, so I just wish the slit was a little higher for my particular purposes. Super comfortable. Easy to wear. Gets wrinkled easily, but using a steamer makes it look lovely."
4.0,"I got these to wash dishes in hot water and not completely destroy my hands in the process.  For this they're great, however they're fairly snug for ""large"".  Since they're so well fitted, they kinda suction to your hands when under hot water and are nearly impossible to get off easily.<br /><br />I recommend getting the size up from what you'd normally get"
4.0,"I like the wallet, its small and not to bulky in the pocket. Plus it is a metal wallet which makes it a very durable and with the extra faces and bands if a face starts showing a lot of wear it can be changed with a new face and your good to go."
4.0,It‚Äôs larger than I expected.  I haven‚Äôt worn it yet to decide if I really like it or not.  I think it will be ok. I tend to wear more dainty and delicate pieces so it‚Äôs probably just an issue of my comfort level.  I‚Äôm definitely going to give it a try.
4.0,"These are so comfortable that I wear them everyday and I need to buy a few more pairs for after my baby is born.  I am currently 180 lbs, 8.5 months pregnant and 5-7.  I bought a size medium based on some of the reviews I was reading.  The length is perfect,  but I think a small would have been a better fit and I could wear them comfortably after my baby is born.  The medium I bought will be too big around the waist.  They are super comfy though and have held up very well in the wash."
4.0,Dress is really cute but the material has no stretch at all and the chest area ended up being too small.
4.0,I am 5'4 and 135lbs and usually wear a size small. After reading the prior reviews I decided to go up a size and get a medium because everyone said it ran small. I love the look of the shirt but I very much wish I would have stuck with a small. It's long enough for me to wear it with leggings now and the sleeves are the perfect length but they are very wide and so is the waist and bottom. I will keep it just to avoid the hassle of a return but I would recommend staying true to your size unless you're planning on wearing it as a tunic.
4.0,Was a little smashed when I got it so it took some time to readjust but other than that overall good mask.
4.0,"Shorts are okay. Waist fit okay. Legs seem a little skinnyish. However,I have a big butt that tends to pull pants and shorts tighter onto my thighs."
4.0,Great material.. I wanted a midi dress.. I got a large it was big for me I'm 36B size 16.. Colors great.. But I returned it... Will size down
4.0,"Very lightweight, Polyester, Spandex material. Nice and breathable, super soft and stretchy.<br /><br />Really nice looking style, casual t-shirt with accents on sleeves. Fits loose and has a nice Round-neck.<br /><br />Perfect for daily wear for errands, activities and even working out.  Washes nicely and ready to wear the next day."
4.0,Nice - plain. A good fit. Comfortable.I like them.
4.0,"Cheap leather wrist band...what? Cost a couple bucks, There ya go."
4.0,"I thought I would like the button up option, but unfortunately it digs into my neck when i have it buttoned all the way. However, it is super soft and comfy."
4.0,As described.  Wash well.
4.0,these glasses are cute. I like the fit. I don't like the little bar at the bridge of the nose. Its not a big deal. I do like them.
4.0,"These are very nice, but they are tapered out to 0g so i cant really use them unless i stretch out to 0g from 2g :&lt; wasnt ready for that step yet. Can hopefully use later on."
4.0,very good with sore feet...
4.0,"The strap on these flip flops was a bit snug, but a good fit other wise. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"longer than expected, but different style"
4.0,"Great bathing suit after purchasing countless both on Amazon and elsewhere.  Fits as expected from images and description, and extremely cute outfit for our upcoming vacation.  Very stylish for a one piece suit yet fits snug without sorry of lost tops and mismatched sets.  Overall happy with the purchase"
4.0,Loving the slide on‚Äôs. They are so comfortable I‚Äôm glad I purchased them.
4.0,"Thinner then I thought, but still nice"
4.0,The mask is great and the lights are really neat. The only issue we had was the top green plastic tore just a tad (an 8 year old was wearing it lol) but that's it. The plastic is pretty tough to stand up to an 8 year old boy!
4.0,"The goggles have not been used yet, but appear to be of good quality.  I was very pleased with the speedy delivery and that the goggles are exactly as described.  Looking forward to using them."
4.0,"Tank top was a good fit but after washing it, i was constantly pulling it down while i was working out at the gym. I also went with the Black shirt with the white trim and the black bled through to the white and made it look dirty, will still wear this around the house but not to the gym"
4.0,"I love this dress. It's long enough that I don't feel self-conscious, and pretty cozy too. I have really long legs and a short torso, most dresses unless they are longer make me feel like a hooker. Be careful how you wash it, might fade."
4.0,"Ordered for my husband who has lost his sight and it is easy for him to  operate...it has great features like a long wide band fit for a man, different alarm sounds and a flat face to keep from snagging objects ....he had another brand and the band was not long enough and it broke and the face came off."
4.0,"This is a really cute idea, but I probably could have made it myself. I paid for expedited shipping and it arrived in a smashed box. Now the tips of the feathers are messed up. Also one side needs more glue added to and they don‚Äôt look very even. I was able to repair this myself!<br /><br />EDIT: Although the packaging was bad and I had to add a little hot glue this headpiece made a huge statement! Everyone complimented on the wings and I have no regrets on purchasing this. I changed my rating to 4 stars. Would be 5 if they shipped with a sturdier box."
4.0,It's cool....makes it easier to remove pins
4.0,Very good product but you must be patient because this comes from China...but the wait was worth it...
4.0,"Comfortable, good value"
4.0,Just gorgeous and love their faceting
4.0,The shirt looks a little longer and the picture but actually it's not quite that long even on an average height person
4.0,"I got new buttons to sew on, because the others were too &#34;dangly&#34;. They just hung there like they didn't belong. The suit is completely adoreable though, and a button is the easiest thing to sew.üòä"
4.0,Product fits well and works as expected. Nice and toasty
4.0,Me encanta esta blusa lo √∫nico malo es q est√° abierto de las mangas
4.0,Cute sleeveless top but extremely thin so you do need to expect to wear it under another garment.  Arrived timely and overall size fit as chart stated.
4.0,Came fast in mail.  I like the colors
4.0,"Great for coaching, itches a bit when the sunglasses is hanging"
4.0,It fit as Expected. If I could make one change I would have liked it a little longer but all in all it was a good $11.00 purchase! I'm 5'6&#34; 150 lbs. Not too busty if that help for others purchasing the same product!
4.0,"I really like the style of the shoe,  they look great. The one thing I don't like about them is they have no pading in the sole at all and if you put any decent insole in it does get a little tight."
4.0,Love it. A little smaller than I expected but that's ok.
4.0,Smaller than thought but besides that love it
4.0,Great to have fo camping
4.0,Little tight fitting - Gave these away to some fat chick.
4.0,"Inexpensive but ok. They do the job.<br />Especially since I have kids and they break them all the time, so it does not make sense to buy more expensive ones every other week."
4.0,"Good watch, not the simplistic thing to set. It took my self, my wife and you tube videos to get it done. Also for a man the twist band is rather short."
4.0,I ordered the tights with the bows.  The bow image loses its shape when worn. A little too distorted for my liking.  The image is not crisp and the black bow print &#34;bleeds.&#34; I like the rest of the tights and they fit pretty well. I'm 5'2'' and 150 lbs.
4.0,are cute but not fil well
4.0,Love this buy! Leggings are a good weight and skirt is perfect length. Very comfortable!
4.0,"So I received this dress and immediately put it on. I typical wear a medium, but maybe should have purchased a large to let it hang a little better. The arm sleeves were a bit short on me and it was a bit tight under the arms because of the shorter length.  The dress is super cute, but may fit someone better that is shorter,  I am 5'8 and the length was a tad short, but pretty close to how it is displayed in the photo.  I think this dress is definitely worth the money, it was good quality and not see through, huge plus.  I will have to look into investing in a larger size.  I would say order a size up just because it is cotton and it could possibly shrink. I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion, I hope you found my review helpful."
4.0,"This top, despite the size chart, fits smaller than I expected. It still fits and I will be keeping it but I expected this top to be oversized based on the size chart.  It is very slim in the arms and can be a little tight in the neck if you don't like that sort of thing."
4.0,"Unfortunately, a lot of clear glue is visible on the front but overall I like the product and it served it‚Äôs purpose."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ae9a57ce82209117ed4737187e17f2a8]] I was given this product in exchange for my honest review. I ordered size medium/large and when the product came it says medium in the label. The ribbed fabric is very soft and stretchy. I‚Äôm typically not a tight,  cropped top kind of girl, but these colors are SO good. The brown is great with my wardrobe because I‚Äôm often drawn to rust and orange tones. The beige color will be a great layering piece with lighter colors. I‚Äôd imagine if you‚Äôre a crop top, high waist pants kind of girl, then you‚Äôll really like these well- made versatile tops. I will note that this particular cut is very narrow around the neck, so if that‚Äôs not comfortable for you, I‚Äôd go with a different style. Though narrow, it doesn‚Äôt seem it will be uncomfortable."
4.0,"Ordered 1/2 size bigger, fits little snug but ok."
4.0,The picture is prettier than the product however it is still beautiful.
4.0,"This dress is cute. I enjoyed wearing it on a Saturday afternoon. I'm about 5'2 and weigh about 128 on a good day. This was definitely tight, but I like things that way. It does not forgive in any way, so be prepared! The buttons are not real, but look nice. I got a bunch of compliments on this, I wore it with a cute pair of flip flops. You really can't beat it for the price."
4.0,"Looks just like I expected! However, these run SMALL. I ordered an XL and it fits like a mens S. It‚Äôs literally the same size as one of my mens small hoodies in length and fit. I ordered an XL hoping it would be baggy on me, but at least it still fits me. Overall still happy with it."
4.0,"Love it. However, buttons on the back are hard to fasten and one came off first time I wore it."
4.0,Overall I have been really happy with the watch band.  I have it on a Gear 3 frontier and it looks quite natural.  For me it is light years more comfortable then the rubber one that came with watch.  I wear the watch and band just about 24 hours a day including many workout sessions such as hot yoga which soaks the band and then in the shower afterwards and it is holding up great.  One issue I did notice was that a few of the holes weren't punched cleanly which made it a bit difficult initially to latch the watch.  I had to &#34;clean&#34; them out/widen them as I kept missing the holes.
4.0,My son loves his shirt. Runs long but fits true to size otherwise.
4.0,Like them for cheap sunglasses
4.0,"Remember when you buy this small size, you will have to fold/bend your hat in the back to make it fit."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. Made of good quality fabric. Doesn‚Äôt look cheap. Fabric is Soft and lightweight, comfortable to wear. No uneasy feeling. However, fitting is little off from under arms . Extra clothes hanging. Other than that it‚Äôs cute"
4.0,"Basically love it, and it's super warm. Not really for hot weather. I wish it had an option for fastening closed.<br /><br />Down side: snags easily. Be careful not to let it  catch on things!"
4.0,"Cons: modern style, snow saucer sized watch -heavy sigh.<br />  Not cheap... and runs fast.<br />Pros : beautiful, no logo on the face, easy winding with ""onion"" stem, that sweet mechanical ticking and sweep separate second hand, with leather band reminiscent of fine horse tack. Heavy luminescence glows all night.  And, no worries about day-date function when you set it aside for a while. Just wind, set time and go!"
4.0,This bra is sooo comfortable! The material is soft and delicate. Straps are cushioned and easily adjusted. But holy moly does this bra squeak! The two circular plastic pieces that hold the straps to the back of the bra are insanely squeaky. All day with every movement I could hear it squeaking. Even my coworker sitting next to me could hear it! Not sure how I‚Äôm going to fix it yet‚Ä¶. But something needs to be done to decrease the awkward noise before I wear it again.
4.0,"I mightve gotten a size too big, but I kept pulling these up. These are the glossy black leggings. They are very comfortable. I didnt use the pocket at all, so I cant say how well it works for a phone."
4.0,Pretty much met my expectations
4.0,I really like these. I got them for my top hole in my ears so they will serve the purpose. I didnt want no expensive pair because I have lost so many. I would recommend these to a friend.
4.0,"This was SUPER cute on my 6 month old for Halloween. The body suit fit great (she's short and chunky), but the feet and the hood were VERY big. Like, the hood fit my 4 year old, who is the size of a 5 year old. The feet were also big. BUT I pinned the feet to the bottom of the pants with safety pins so they wouldn't fall off. I could have stuffed them with socks or something too, but I didn't think of that until afterwards. The hood I tried to pin, but she was too wiggly, and the result was ineffectual. Oh well. It was SUPER cute though. :-) We got a lot of compliments."
4.0,"The bottom part was nice, but the top part must be worn with a very good bra.  It has no firmness to it.  But it's very cute, otherwise."
4.0,Nice piece for an adolescent gift.
4.0,"This costume is very authentic looking. My grandson loves to wear it. The soft molded mask well made. However, the smell of the mask is pretty intense."
4.0,Better than most pins I've had in the past. I really like the square shape
4.0,Very comfortable and stretchy. Love that they are high waisted. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the length of the legs is shorter than portrayed in the picture. They come right below the knee on me.
4.0,Excellent cheap watch! Just wish the wristband was a little longer.
4.0,Great fit for a great price
4.0,Pretty nice. Wish the outside where the leather is cut was the same color as the earring. Makes earrings look cheap but most colors look good.
4.0,"These glasses work well, let's light in from sides sometimes."
4.0,1 was bigger than the others.
4.0,"I purchase an EXL since clothing from over seas run small. 160#, 5'7&#34;. Fits as expected. Material is thin, you can see panty line through dress. Hits me just below knees. I would purchase again for this price."
4.0,Nice but wear through pretty quickly. Good for little kids with wife feet
4.0,"So cute, I like them."
4.0,"I liked how the material didn't feel cheap. Everything overall was good except for the shoulder pads which made it look bulky. Judging from the comments, the vendor was polite, which i liked. Im not exactly American, i come from a different country and custom made was too expensive for me, so i guess thats kind of my fault. Everything was good though, and i recommend!"
4.0,Satisfied with the actual product
4.0,"Great product and good Quality, was tiny bit small"
4.0,"These tiny earrings are undeniably beautiful and classy. You can wear them with anything, dressy or casual. I only gave them 4 stars because the stones on the bottom were a lot smaller than I was expecting. But still a beautiful earing. And it's a true rose gold."
4.0,Good cheap sunglasses
4.0,"Good low cost silver ring, Xmas present for my 13 year old daugter.  She loves it, wears almost every day."
4.0,Fit very good around the waist. A little long though. I was going to return them because of that but decided to keep them. Great shorts good decision to keep them.
4.0,Very giftable for that sassy lady in your circle. Perfect to add some sassy bling to a zipper pull or purse.
4.0,It's a very cute shirt and I love it! The arms fit a little tight and are a bit shorter than pictured but I still love it!
4.0,A bit large but ok
4.0,Kind of short but very cute for a simple night out
4.0,"Was going to give it to a friend, and I purchased a large which it fits me so I will keep it for myself...Very CUTE for the price!!!!!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs stylish, looks great. Happy with the purchase. Didn‚Äôt give a 5 star cause I had to turn and fix the wrist part a few times but it‚Äôs not a big deal. Maybe making it a little tighter or firmer would help."
4.0,"Ordered large; a bit big, but love the style, comfort and fabric. Will order again in medium!"
4.0,Nice can't beat the price.
4.0,"5‚Äô3‚Äù Ns 130lbs.  Started with the small and it ended up to be a little too small so I repurchased a medium and it fit well. I could have been a little bit more ruffled on the top, otherwise it is very cute."
4.0,Great shirt a little small
4.0,Perfect gift for my friend
4.0,Adorable. A little big for a toddlers head ( I bought for a 3 year old) but cute. Great for a traditional flower girl look.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but I feel like they run a bit big.  I wear a size 8 and ordered a med.  they feel just a bit loose.  I‚Äôm going to order a small."
4.0,"I do like the ring, a great value and it fits perfectly.  I had to carefully bend the tips in a bit and gently file them, as they were potential little weapons and/or could catch on clothing."
4.0,"They look great and feel soft and cushy, but they adjustment piece leaves stains on the band if it gets wet."
4.0,"Great-looking boots, nice quality leather, comfortable. . . but the laces are just for looks and can't tighten around the ankles, so my narrow heel kept slipping out every step.  Too bad, because they are really nice.  Had to return.  But if your foot fits it more tightly than mine did and you don't need the tightening, they seem like a great boot!"
4.0,Classic pair of aviators
4.0,The shoes were what we expected.  They fit well.
4.0,Cap was nice fitting very comfortable and stylish even after wearing after few months still in great condition would recommend to any who the style and color.
4.0,"I bought an XL when I wear a Large. The pants are GORGEOUS. The only problem is that I can't zip them or button them without the waist part digging in to my stomach. I'm going to modify them for under my cosplay that I needed it for, but... I wish they made a XXL size."
4.0,Beautiful dress..slip underneath tooooo short
4.0,"I am trying to get used to the feel of these reflexology sandals, very different to any sandal I have ever worn!"
4.0,This dress is very pretty but I didn't care for the ruffle around the neck. I've gained weight 5'6 and about 175 and the XL fit fine but it wasn't the comfortable for what I needed it for.
4.0,"great value, they are very cute, and made well"
4.0,Good quality. Great for running. Received quickly. Light compression.
4.0,I like the dress. Its very comfortable and I love the fabric.
4.0,Very nice‚Ä¶fit my hubby just right ‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs very comfortable wearing
4.0,They were exactly what I ordered BUT turned my wrist green by the end of the day
4.0,Good product with great fit. A little bit bulky but otherwise very good for the price
4.0,"I did not want this bag for an Ipad, but for an everyday shoulder bag.  The one I had was too large and heavy.  I think the bag is nice, well made and perfect, but not for me.  I need a little more room than this bag provides.  I would have preferred more pockets also.  It most likely is excellent for the Ipad, but I do not have one."
4.0,Beautiful sweater runs big
4.0,The shoe fit perfectly but unlike the original crocs the back band is a little tighter and does not offer enough wiggle room
4.0,"I understand the importance of wearing a mask in these pandemic times, but as I have breathing issues I have had to curtail my visits to stores and other retail businesses because I simply can't tolerate wearing a mask for more than 15 minutes or so. I get out of breath walking around stores like Walmart, which makes me breathe harder, which sucks the mask material against my nose and mouth and has, on occasion, precipitated a panic attack. I've had to leave stores with a half-filled cart abandoned in the aisle because I could not catch my breath. I've tried both surgical-type masks and expensive multi-layered cloth masks, with the same negative results.<br /><br />I saw an ad on a social media site for mask frames, and I always double-check Amazon for price and product comparisons. That's how I found these, and for the low price I thought I had nothing to lose. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much they improve the mask-wearing experience. My glasses still fog up a bit, but not as much as they did wearing masks without the frame. The little notches fit neatly into the folds on the surgical paper masks and stay in place very well. I can even just fit one over my face and then top with a cloth mask, with no other support, and they stay in place. You could just put a few stitches in to secure the frame to the cloth permanently, and wash them together. I may do that, in fact!<br /><br />One caveat: There is a very slight rough bit on the bottom of the frame where it rests just below your lip. I imagine that's where the molded pieces fit together before they were separated. A few swipes with a bit of fine sandpaper took care of that problem. Alternately, you could wrap that portion with a small bandaid.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a very good option for people like me who want to do the right thing and protect others, but find that masks create breathing and/or panic issues. Even if the pandemic eases enough that mask wearing becomes unnecessary, these would still be very useful for people with breathing problems to mask up when dusting, cleaning or changing kitty litter, gardening during high pollen season, or other occasions where protecting your airways from irritants is important."
4.0,This is a wonderful tote bag. Its super sturdy and quite large. Great for hauling books or a laptop.
4.0,They work great for our four eyed family. My bf has super thick heavy lenses that would always slide down his nose. These keep his glasses in place even during strenuous work. They do wear out after a few months.
4.0,"I was looking for a hoodie to wear for the fall and this is not it. I ordered a medium because I wanted it a little bigger. ( Although I recommend sizing up ) The fabric is like a polyester,  so I‚Äôm a little disappointed. The colors look just as pictured and I love the print but sadly, I am returning it Because it‚Äôs much thinner and not but I was expecting."
4.0,Love the material. Great to sleep in. Definitely no support for workout...I'd bounce myself to death!
4.0,"I‚Äôm like 149lbs, this is a small I love it as you can see it fits great on me but it‚Äôs too sheer"
4.0,A bit smaller than most
4.0,"I honestly do love this dress- it's flattering and easy to take care of. The material isn't great for summer- it doesn't breathe and it's fairly heavy. If this was cotton it would be perfect.<br /><br />Two of the decorative buttons were already off the dress when I took it out of the packaging, but that's not a big deal since they don't actually hold the dress closed. I was able to find matching buttons and it was an easy fix.<br /><br />The sizing is the only issue, and it's not their fault- you can get 12 dresses the same size and each company will fit differently. I should have ordered a size down from what I usually wear, so unless you're very busty (I'm a 36 D) you may want to order smaller. The material has stretch to it, so don't be afraid if you're an in-between size, you should be safe to order smaller.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the dress and I'll buy from this company again."
4.0,"It's more baggy than I anticipated, but still looks good. I am 5'7&#34; and I could wear it as a dress if I needed/wanted to."
4.0,Best hygiene bag ever
4.0,"I just received them not too long ago. They're great quality, very stretchy material, but the end of the sock doesn't stay on my thigh as I had hoped. Reading the reviews, I expected them to be a little tight on me. They were, in fact, the complete opposite! They're a little too big on me, so they go way up my thigh.<br />Still great quality, I highly recommend them. I'm definitely going to wear them with my Lolita outfits and with skirts and shorts."
4.0,I love it but it runs small I'm a size 4 and I got small. I sound say if you don't want this to be &#34;snug&#34; get a larger size. The material is stretchy so I do not have to return. Pattern is very pretty/feminine.
4.0,"I ordered xlarge for my husband but received a small , no regrets cuz I was able to wear it for myself ,got alot of complimentsüòÅ.. I didn't bother to return or re-order cuz I saw alot of reviews on same issue of receiving small"
4.0,"I bought the large size. I'm 5'10. 160 Lbs. I'm also a 36C. The top fit fairly well but shows lots of skin, through no fault of my build, there's just not alot of material to cover my b**bs. The bottom is very cheeky. Overall the bathing suit is really cute."
4.0,"These are very pretty. Deep blue color that I love and just the right size for me. The only problem I noticed is the post on one of the earrings is slight bent, but doesn't affect the look or wearability at all."
4.0,Don't like thematerial . cute dress though.
4.0,Goes to the bare edge of wallet
4.0,It‚Äôs a mask what can I say!
4.0,"My son looooves these! I personally am a bit tired of chasing little red balls of fleece fuzz around the house. They've gotten on rugs, floors, towels, everything."
4.0,"Love these shoes! I had read reviews before purchasing and ordered up 1/2 size (normally wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8). Shoes were comfortable but tight through the top. I‚Äôm hoping they stretch a bit... this was the only area they were tight. I probably could have gotten away with an 8.5 and been more comfortable. But they are cute and comfortable to walk in, true to Sorel shoes!"
4.0,My daughter uses for school & liked so much I bought another.
4.0,This is a great product but it did not suit my body type. My chest area is flat and I looked even flatter like a boy wearing this. I gave to my sister and it suit her body type perfectly. We both wear either 32a or b bra size.
4.0,A little big but it‚Äôs still beautiful
4.0,"This is a nice ring. It has a good weight and feel, and it is a good width. It looks like a quality ring, and as a tungsten it should hold up well.  The little CZ on it gives it just an added bit of 'pop.'  Feel we got a good value for what we paid for it."
4.0,I wish the neck was a little bit bigger but I'll keep it. Soft material.<br />I usually wear an xl and this is an 3xl. Very breathable.
4.0,"What I like:  These are like sweat pants for kids.  The elastic waistband is wide enough to not fold over.  The pockets are great.  The ankles have elastic bands so the pants wont hang too long.  The fabric is 60% cotton, 40% polyester.  They are very comfortable.<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like:  Fussy laundry instructions‚Äîthese have to be washed in cold water only, and inside out.  The fabric,though soft and comfortable, does not seem very durable at all.  These are like indoor lounging pants.  Rough and tumble boys will probably wear through the knees fairly quickly.  The currently advertised price of $25.99 for two pair seems about right to me."
4.0,Love the break down on the intake of water they the day.. keeps u on track getting that water in
4.0,These pants are very comfortable to run in. They are light weight. I would recommend going a size bigger than usual. This pair was cut small.
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 175 lbs.  This is exactly what I wanted.  Long enough to cover my tush, but light and sheer. Perfect with a long tank layered under it. I'll be ordering more."
4.0,There good for what they are a prop for a 80s party
4.0,"I held off writing my review till it went through the laundry. Very cute dress. Fit comfortably though it does not stress. Flattering at first (5""2""  140 lb -- got a medium). After washing, it did shrink and the waist then was way too high. The flattering look was gone and because no stretch it was not as easy to take off.  Suggest you order a size up where it might be a little loose (though it won't hurt the look at all) and you will not be affected by the looser feel.  It is a nice lightweight dress. Perfect for summer wear and with a nice pair of sandals can be worn comfortably to church, to an afternoon gathering, to a BBQ or simply around the house. Recommend."
4.0,the rose gold option was not rose gold but just like a light shade of gold
4.0,"Beautiful, well-made dress. Flowy and sexy at the same time. Love it!"
4.0,"Gorgeous and so big and flowy. I am 5'9&#34;, 116 lbs, dress size 2-4 and I ordered an XL. It isnt long enough for me to wear it high waisted, I have to wear it down on my hips in order for it to touch the floor so it was pretty tight. I currently have it stretched over the back of a chair to try to stretch out the elastic band a little. Over all really gorgeous and definitely worth purchasing but if you're 5'9&#34; or taller go for the 2XL if you plan to wear it high waisted. The size determines the length not the waistband size."
4.0,"The quality is very high, the bag is big, but unfortunately the shoulder strap is very long..."
4.0,"Good quality.  Looks nice.  Keeps the Fiio secure and protected.  My only complaint would be the buttons.  Even though there's a slight indent for each button, you can't feel them.  I find myself having to pick up the device and look at the side to push buttons."
4.0,"I like this suit! It runs just a bit small. I thought the design of the top would fit weird with the way the bust was constructed, but it wasn't an issue for me (and I am large chested) Other than that, I would recommend."
4.0,A fun piece. Goes well will causal wear.
4.0,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my mother.  It is simple but very pretty.
4.0,The color/pattern was nice.
4.0,"This is lovely and great value, but o vant even read it with my glasses on. The face is tiny."
4.0,"Not lightweight at all. Its about twice as heavy as my other capris.. they are nice pants, material seems good, waistband is a little thick and so is the material even though it looks a tiny bit seethrough. But I'm wearing them first time at work in a factory and I'm sweating more because they are heavier.. love the pockets though they are deep"
4.0,Cute earrings got compliments
4.0,My daughter loves this hat. Looks exactly like picture and fits perfectly on her. She loves bts And she couldn‚Äôt be any happier.
4.0,"Cute, but a tad tighter than I expected."
4.0,"Only thing is the fit of the cap, otherwise it's great!"
4.0,This switch opener is one of the better quality plastic switch openers. This works very well for Kailh styled housings but not quite well for MX styled switches. It takes more time to open MX styled switches but overall very good product!
4.0,"Purchased for my sister and myself. Black bracelet is entirely too big for me, but the white fits her fine. They should be made to be the same size. Other than that, they‚Äôre okay."
4.0,"Great top, comfy"
4.0,I like it but is hand washing or dry cleaning!  Other than that it is nice and fits well.
4.0,Very pretty color and like the size but it is a little too stiff
4.0,Works and decent for price
4.0,"Great looking band, fit well but color wearing off on bottom all ready. other wise great"
4.0,This is a durable and compact edc bag. The Molle points are nice. I added a water bottle slot to one side and another pouch to the other and it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôve had this thing in the rain and it did great. No leaks. I use this when not working as a man bag. Hold everything I need.
4.0,"Good but too stretchy at the top  where you want it to be tighter. I wish there was an XS. I‚Äôm 135 and 5‚Äô4 and got a small but the Waist it too stretchy. I can take it in though. Otherwise thick stretchy good material, very comfortable"
4.0,Bought these for my son and he loved them! I would give them a 5 star if they were completely true to size. They still worked out nicely tho.
4.0,very good jacet thank you fast shiping i wait whether now is still cold tank you
4.0,"Nice material, I ordered a medium based on reviews that it was too small but turns out it was too big! Love the front pocket. Only reason it has 4 stars is because the movable straps are hard to adjust."
4.0,"Nice design, and good quality/weight. The fox looks more like a dog in my opinion, but my bf's only complaint was that the cord irritated his neck. Easy fix: new cord."
4.0,bill was slightly distorted but not too bad to notice
4.0,My daughter loved this. The only downside is the wings ripped that same night and she‚Äôs careful with her stuff.
4.0,"Love to have indigo....and date a little larger, I need a magnifying glass to see now..lol"
4.0,"Nice jacket, a tad too small, order a size up and be happy"
4.0,Fun add on for Halloween costume.
4.0,"The heat elements were not as large as I could have hoped, but the gloves are comfortable and they do warm up"
4.0,I liked it. The item worked well
4.0,"Not sure why the reviews on this are bad, but it's a great hat. I've got a pretty big head (7 5/8) and this hat fits comfortably."
4.0,"Arrived quickly....<br />My only complain is that, there was lot of plasticy/hairly lint on the gloves..<br />Looked like some had been touching their cat while wearing this and it appeared to be used. Took me some time to clean it<br /><br />Other than this, it is of good quality."
4.0,"This was actually really cute I can‚Äôt wait to lose all my ‚Äúbaby‚Äù weight cause then it would fit perfect (right now cause I still have the baby belly pouch)it‚Äôs a bit ‚Äúfitted‚Äù but I‚Äôm happy with it, for now"
4.0,These are very comfortable and I really like them.  The color is NOT pink though.
4.0,Product was as described the size was a bit small
4.0,More than adequate for price. Great value
4.0,My daughter loves these tights.  The fit great and I like the assortment of colors.  Great deal!
4.0,I bought these for my son - he appears to like them - they fit him nicely so I would say the are true to size.
4.0,Nice dress but a little too body con for a slender size 8!
4.0,"I recommend this piece of luggage for anyone who travels infrequently.  I doubt it will stand up to frequent use, but for the occasional traveler it will fit the bill."
4.0,"A little lower profile than I expected for a tactical style band. But it still protects well and has worn well (I swap between a few bands) over months. Great deal, thx again."
4.0,Muy bonitas y se cambian f√°cilmente s√∫per duraderas
4.0,I love the style and colour but the only disappointing thing is that it was really tight around the waste area for me.
4.0,"Very pretty but I cannot wear it without buying an extender.  An EXTRA extender since it does have one attached. It is short for maybe a very thin person?  With the extender, my necklace is 14‚Äù long.  I don‚Äôt think I could have worn this as a teen. Now, on to purchase at least a 6‚Äù extender, wish me luck!"
4.0,The space  between the eyes is too big.  I can't see some playstation if I am in angle.
4.0,"very comfy shirt, i would recommend going up a size form your normal shirt size as it is a little tight."
4.0,"Good product, summer vent and confortable, miss some pockets...."
4.0,"They aren‚Äôt bad, they fit well, the fabric just isn‚Äôt as soft as I was hoping it would be. More like football Jersey consistency."
4.0,"My wife loves this sweater. It's a very light material, she said it's good for spring/summer and she wants more in other colors."
4.0,These are well made for the price and a good overall value.
4.0,Adorable shirt made with a very soft material. What I didn‚Äôt care for was the fit. It specifically states that it‚Äôs a women‚Äôs shirt so I ordered a medium but it fits more like a unisex medium making it huge on me.
4.0,I think the sizing is wrong. Large is more of a 14/16 US size. Material was soft and perfect though.
4.0,This band is awesome. It added a danty stylish look compared to the black band I was originally using.  However the tool that it comes with to size the band was so cheaply made it bent after the first pin came out making it very difficult to size the band. I was fearful it would tarnish after getting wet but so far so good. Very pleased
4.0,This is really cute but it is smaller then I thought.
4.0,YES I SURE LIKED THIS BAG HOPE YOU GET IT BACK IN SOON  HOLDS A TON ON STUFF
4.0,came on time and fix good
4.0,"Cute bag, but I wish the strap was better quality. It‚Äôs very cheap and doesn‚Äôt feel sturdy. Otherwise it‚Äôs cute!"
4.0,"Looks like a great shoe but the size is way to small for my son. He wears a 2 and I ordered the 2/3 size but it was way to small. So, order a size bigger than you expect."
4.0,Size was a bit smaller than usual mediums. But the quality is fantastic.
4.0,Loved it sadly this all fell apart aver a frew washes
4.0,My 10 year old loves them.
4.0,Nice quality but smaller then I thought ! There ok pretty dressy but like I said smaller then I pictured !
4.0,haven't used them yet but they look good
4.0,Remember these are tight because thats what compression is! Nice socks just a little tight. Very satisfied!!
4.0,socks work for what they are supposed to do.  Wish they did not have logo on them.
4.0,"I have been looking for something like this so that I can store my passport and other such stuff while traveling. Its compact but still spacious. Has lot of compartments and can store plenty of stuff such as power-bank, smartphone and keys etc. Comes with adjustable strap which makes it easier to carry. Zippers are okay quality. Its weird that the back zipper is brown in color while front zipper are of different color."
4.0,"Small around the knee and thigh area, but nice pants."
4.0,This bag is not big but it carries a lot. Love this bag.
4.0,"These are better made than I expected. One, the lights didn't work, but for the price, it happens.<br />My grandchildren liked them."
4.0,"You can see the tear marks where it's just a piece of cardboard ripped off in squares. Make sure to open this and adjust it before giving it as a gift. The cardboard doesn't fit well either, making the chain fall randomly inside the box. Nice necklace, though. Wish there was a chain-length option"
4.0,"These are great, we love this brand. The only issue with this particular one was that it had a one way zipper on the snake print. Weird."
4.0,The bright colors on the strap draw the eyes away from the tightness on the mid section. One night thing is that they stay in place when doing HIIT.
4.0,It's a red shirt that was comfortable and appropriate for a Elf-themed Halloween costume.
4.0,Very pretty! They look like the real thing!
4.0,"Sad they‚Äôre so aggressively large, since I love grilled shrimp, but they really do the best job of keeping veggies and other larger meats on."
4.0,Nice fabric n good work.stylish look.
4.0,"This a true red color, 5 strand necklace made of resin and comes from China. Shipping time was 8 days to Ca, USA. Comes nicely packaged with a bag to keep it in. My first impression is that it was heavier than most of my necklaces weighing about 26gms, or 9 oz. The shortest length measures approximately 22&#34;. I wore it for the evening out and must say I really liked it with my red belt. The weight did not bother me. It did come with a noticeable musty smell, so I was forced to wash it, then read in the instructions after, not to put it in water. But I just couldn't have that smell around my neck. Not sure what the water will do to the red threads it is strung on. I didn't see any red come off when I washed it in cold water. The gold findings are nice with a little sparkly doo-dad next to the hook. The necklace I received did not have the little ball at the end of the chain shown in the example picture. I took one star away for the odor, and because a part was missing that is shown in the example picture. Not a bad necklace for the price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a $1.00 discount on this product for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Fits really cute.
4.0,They were a little big but very comfortable. Excellent material! Durable and thick so you won't get a whole the first time you wear them. I will definitely get another pair but maybe in a smaller size this time!
4.0,"Product runs a full size big so size down. My husband wears a 9.5 and since there are no half sizes in this shoe he had to size down to an 8, fits perfect."
4.0,I love yellow and it fits perfectly
4.0,"I Split my time between NYS and Fla.  This robe is light enough for Florida weather, and soooo comfortable I ordered another for NYS.  Shower, dry off, and perfect when drying your hair and applying make-up.  The sleeves are long."
4.0,"Handy , cute , good quality"
4.0,This is a very cute suit. Runs big but didnt really realize until I went into water. Wish it came in a smaller size. It rides around in water since it was big on me.
4.0,Cozy and fun.  I wear them with flip flops in the winter and they are perfect.  So far just great although I haven't washed them yet.
4.0,"Loved the dress. Ordered a small, it was way to big on me. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 105lb. I sent it back. Wish it came in a smaller size"
4.0,"This top runs smaller than all of the other Med Couture tops I own in the same size.  While the quality is nice, I would have preferred the fit that I am accustomed to with this brand."
4.0,Very nice-a little difficult to hook but very good color/definitely recommend
4.0,"I love these leggings *for the price point and colors. They have a more cotton-y feel and not slick/cool to the touch kind of activewear/yoga leggings. They have no cotton though, which makes these practical for the gym. I wear these for low impact days like when I‚Äôm only going to work my upper body and not squatting. I have them in red and olive green and they‚Äôre squat proof though. I only wish you carried this in an extra small because it‚Äôs a little big on my waist and I‚Äôm a size 0/2 in jeans. Also, I‚Äôm mentioning this in hopes that the brand/owner reads this. There are brands like ‚Äúkittygains‚Äù on Instagram that buy these leggings and jack up the price to $40 and pretend she designed them herself."
4.0,Like the shirt. Gave it four stars because the shoulders/arms are a little tight
4.0,"gorgeous dress. but VERY thick material. I bought it for a cruise but it will be way too hot. disappointed. seems to run small. According to size chart, I would wear a small, but it was very snug at the waist.<br /><br />I am wondering if your shop has dresses made of lighter material more suitable for summer time wear."
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings. The quality and design are great. it looks classy. Also, they are versatile. You can match them with casual or formal dresses. The only complaint is that they are kind of expensive for gold-plated earrings."
4.0,"It's very Ridgid..The only disappointment with this product is that it only comes with 10 plastic sheets with 3 pockets in each sheet. they need to make albums with 20,40,and 50 sheets"
4.0,"Not amazing, but nice. It was what I expected"
4.0,"I absolutely love my coverup! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the straps are a little large and that makes the fit somewhat awkward. Otherwise, I adore this!"
4.0,Pretty solid bag for the price.
4.0,Cute but not for men like it says
4.0,Nice sunglasses overall but because they are so bendable they often fall down my son‚Äôs nose.  Otherwise they are a good product. I like that they are polarized and come with a case.
4.0,This is a nice folding grocery tote and long handles. The side handles are not very sturdy as they rip after a few months with very little use. All in all it serves the purpose.
4.0,"These are cute socks, but a little big for a size 6 and made of a thin material. Definitely good for the price (4 pack)"
4.0,"I love this shape of earring that are a little like ear crawlers, so you can twist them so that the swoops of the leaves goes up your ear, rather than hangs down it. The rose gold color is really pretty. These are a little larger than I first expected, so they come a bit closer to being on the gaudy side. But, they catch the light nicely and have a very ""spring"" look to them. I can see that these would be a great gift for Mother's Day!"
4.0,"love it, fits just a little big, but nothing a little bra wont fix. perfect!"
4.0,The comfort In the cold is great an having the anti fog helps your vision they look great an at a fair price
4.0,"I wouldn't consider this a bathing suit cover up, it doesn't go past the privates/butt ....if you have a large chest, it gets hung up there and won't hang as long. It says one size but it fits like a large.<br />BUT to wear it over a tshirt, this is so cute! So very soft and silky. Nice fabric, well made, I love it. I wore this with some light denim crops and white chucks. Got a lot of compliments! I'd buy more of these. It was an unexpected wardrobe addition, if someone had suggested to me to buy one I would have said NOPE. It's not my normal style but I loved how it looked and maybe the fact it was so out of my comfort zone is why the compliments were coming. I'm very pleased and I'd buy more"
4.0,"This is a cute dress and it is really comfortable. Can be dressed up or down really easily. I only docked one star because I thought the pleats were a little awkward, but overall it was a welll made dress."
4.0,A little tight I. The arms and large in the bust However I get a ton of compliments when I wear it! Very cute!
4.0,"I like a darker shade but these are perfect. I love the colors, comfortability, and style of these."
4.0,"The band is a good color, almost my flesh tone so it blends well with most outfits. It is comfortable to wear. It snapped on easily. The last hole is still a little large for my very small wrist, and in that hole, the strap sticks far out. I had to trim it with scissors, which was easy to do. I would have preferred for the band to come in a choice of smaller size. The price represented a good value."
4.0,Was what expected
4.0,They run a little smaller than I expected but are really soft and comfortable to wear. I bought hem for part of a costume but think i will add them to my regular wardrobe.
4.0,Dress looked lovely and fit perfectly (they messaged me to get my measurements). Only complaint is that the lining doesn‚Äôt go all the way down and that is pretty obvious in person and in photos. Otherwise the dress is everything I hoped for and I took some incredible pics out in the snow.
4.0,"This dress was very comfty! If you have hips this dress is definitely for u!!! If you're on the slender side u can stick rock it though, just get a good fit.  I'm 5'5 about 150 and I think I got a large, but needed belly space. Fits good could have went with a med though. Good thick material not cheap feeling."
4.0,Of course I will not be wearing all of them. I have granddaughters that are asking for them.
4.0,I had hoped it had a 16 inch chain based on the picture but I think the model just has a big neck. The chain is actually 18 inches. It also has some extra chain attached as if you could extend the chain but the extra chain is on the clasp side - it's useless. The necklace is cute otherwise although the lotus flips upside down now and again.
4.0,Fit was one size off and I'm a large trim. If I had a gut it would be unwearable. I also didn't realize that the chest zipper was only a decoration--there is no pocket behind it.<br />Just got the xl  as a replacement and it's perfect
4.0,"Great suit for the price if you're self conscious or just want to have a throwback suit. I am a little disappointed because after reading several reviews, I ended up ordering a size too large. It still fits but would have looked a lot better one size smaller. I'll probably just buy another one in a different color.<br /><br />The suit came in a reusable ziploc bag and the quality was surprising to me for the price point especially. I've already recommended it to two relatives. My only frustration is the sizing. It just seems silly."
4.0,"My 5-year-old daughter loves these boots! They're starting to thread around the front after her wearing it to school for about a month now, however, which is disappointing (I expected it to be more durable than that), but she seems comfortable in them, and they are adorable on her."
4.0,Covers most of my overweight hips!
4.0,"These are a steal for the price. The only reason this isn't a 5 star product is because they ride up a tiny bit and I feel it is my duty to say so, even though I went back and bought a second set of the same shirts because they are so great!<br /><br />I am 6'3, 220 and these shirts fit me tight enough to hide that I was 285 5 months ago. I wear them as compression shirts but I've been caught wearing them as Tees in a bind.<br /><br />Can't say how happy I truly am with these enough."
4.0,"This bracelet is nice and shiny, and adds a spark to my already silver bracelet-bound arm.  It definitely is a standout, and quite in style this year.  It adds a bit of class to my wrist.  Of course it's not pure silver, so take care to remove it nightly, and give it a break from your arm.  I believe if it is well taken care of (I dip mine in a gentle liquid jewelry cleaner every now and then), you'll have it to enjoy for many years!"
4.0,PERFECT for the lake. No velcro or breaking them in. We have ordered these twice and they are great! Order a size up if you want them to last 2 years... they basically stick like glue to your kids feet so size doesn't matter unless they are too small and their toes are crunched OR if they are too big and they can't walk without scrapping the front. But we have ordered a size bigger than what our child is in because of the odd sizing AND so they fit longer. I actually want to get me and my husband each a pair of the adult ones!
4.0,Very nice. A bit heavy but good for everyday wear.
4.0,"Cheaply made but fits. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 120 pounds and got a medium, it was a little big but not enough to warrant getting a small. Wore a slip under it since material was see through with brighter undergarments and wore a cute red belt (waist wasn‚Äôt quite fitted to my curves and sleeves were too long; I just rolled up the sleeves). Altogether a cute purchase that got many compliments at my holiday singing group party. :)"
4.0,Will need to return for next smaller size.
4.0,Adorable. My daughter loves these.
4.0,This is a comfortable sleeveless hoodie 4 Gym or home or casual wear
4.0,"I love the material in the blouse and like the fit, both through the shoulders and bodice.  My only disappointment was the lace of a fastening closure at the top of the blouse and right below the collar.  The collar is lovely, but I would like to fasten it, either with a button or hook and eye.  It is open fairly far down the bodice and is not my favorite style.  Other than that, it is a wonderful fit and very comfortable."
4.0,I purchased them for my granddaughter and they were perfect for the intended use.
4.0,A nicely done knitted cardigan.<br />Great stitching! It‚Äôs keeps you warm. Cozy and soft.  Indoor or outdoor use.
4.0,"Soft, light weight, perfect fit! Gave it a 4 because some of the trim wasn't stitched."
4.0,"The traction on the outsole is great. I ordered my daughter 1.5 larger than she usually wears and they are tight so they run a little small. They are cute, just as pictured!"
4.0,"Cards a a little hard to remove. Sometimes I feel like a fool trying to get them out at the cash register and they are just stuck. Other than that, good product."
4.0,"Bought this as a thankyou gift for my cousin.She's on vacation so I'm not sure if she loves it yet .However it was a great price,sterling silver,and the perfect gift for the message it was meant to convey.Also it arrived exactly when it said it would."
4.0,Have had them for a few weeks and my daughter has already ripped a hole in the toe.. wish the soles had an extra layer of leather or something so they didn't rip so quickly!
4.0,This isnt something like super fancy obviously look at the price! The earrings really werent that great but the necklace was perfect for partying as I am not afraid to break it or lose it. But I still get too look good!
4.0,"The skirt definitely had a weird smell when it arrived, but it wasn't too overpowering. After reading reviews, I expected it to be much worse. Also, at height 5' 4'' and weight 110 lbs, it reaches just above my knees. I'm using it for shorter, cosplay skirts that don't really NEED the frill, but it adds to the flowing, anime image of the skirt In this case, I'll have to wear it a little high for most school girl or lolita-esque cosplay, but it does the job well. AS A NOTE to some people who were questioning how scratchy it might be, it's really not that scratchy. Just make sure you turn it inside out when you get it because it arrives with the inside showing. I have a feeling some people who disliked the fabric on the inside didn't realize that it was inside out when purchased.<br /><br />There aren't a LOT of layers to the skirt, but there are enough to make the skirt float up. This is not for serious lolita costumes that need absurd amounts of poof unless you want to buy ten of them. Otherwise, for a little extra flare to a cute skirt, buy this product."
4.0,It was shorter then I thought but the fabric was soft.
4.0,I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lot for $40. All I wanted was it to look like the picture and not gaudy. Running and accurate within a minute a day would be nice as well. The watch achieved my expectations and in fact looked as good as the picture. It appears to run about 30 sec fast a day but that‚Äôs ok for $40. I put a leather strap on it because I don‚Äôt like metal bracelets. The bracelet was nice though. If you‚Äôre looking for a cheap Chinese watch and like the style. I say go for it. I have only had it for two days so I don‚Äôt know if it will still be running in two months but I will update. I mean it‚Äôs only $40.
4.0,Order at least two sizes larger ... it's small.  I ordered up and it fits - but barely.
4.0,"I really like this keychain, the infinity symbol is a special symbol to my guy and I.<br />So this is perfect. Alot smaller than I thought but I love it. It's very well made. No scratches"
4.0,I brought this laptop case as a gift for my son. He liked it but would have preferred a more subtle color.
4.0,These fit really well‚Ä¶ other than the camel toe!! Make sure you wear thick underwear if you have a bigger fupa lol<br /><br />I ordered a size medium 5‚Äô5 200lbs bottom heavy. True to size.<br /><br />Super long tho.
4.0,"It's not as flowy as expected, very boxy and heavy. It is cute though, maybe with a sleeveless cardigan."
4.0,Check sizes. Kids medium is for an infant
4.0,"It's my first garment bag. I will probably use it &#60;5 times a year and it looks and feels like I should get a long life out of it; multiple years. It's not a super-high quality luxury bag but that's not what I expected it to be. Fit three jackets, five shirts, and one pair of pair of pants in the zippered hanging compartment, and another pair of pants folded in an outside pocket. It was VERY full, but i fit everything. I didn't try putting shoes or anything else on the inside."
4.0,Perfect fiitin soo good i bought another one hahah
4.0,Did not fit my glasses my fault ok product
4.0,"I personally find zocks too thin in the foot area, so have been trying a few different brands that have a stocking type leg, but more of a sock at the foot.  These were one of the better priced test socks & I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the quality."
4.0,"Nice, just didn‚Äôt like how it looked on me plus runs a little small"
4.0,I was looking for an inexpensive pair of shorts to run in.  I didn‚Äôt want to spend a fortune and these were $6!!  So I said ‚Äúwhy not give it a try?‚Äù
4.0,It‚Äôs great fit to face thought the shades would be a little bit darker
4.0,"No battery, wound watch. Worked very well until I dropped it, was broken beyond repair."
4.0,The material is nice and it fits great
4.0,"I have what they are calling ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, though I think it‚Äôs almost more ‚Äúteal‚Äù.  This one-piece swimsuit is fully lined in the front only. The back is not lined.  The lining is white.  I wish the lining were the same color as the swimsuit itself.  There is padding in the cups and the padding is removable.  The only adjustments that can be made is with the tie behind the neck.  The fabric has a lot of stretch to it. Very slick and thin.  This swimsuit is Made in China."
4.0,"At first I didn't care for the white fill in the links, but then realized I have a lot of clothing accented with white. These earrings are perfect to wear with these clothing items. The earrings are very light weight which I prefer. They are not an elegant style but will work for casual wear."
4.0,"Feels well made, fits perfectly, a bit too thick but looks like it will last.<br />Overall I like it!"
4.0,"Very cute, does need some love to make it work for my agent carter costume"
4.0,"Not what I expected but is so darn cute! I definitely use this cute wristlet, though. It is soft, has three equal sized zipper pockets that I can fit my eyeglasses in one side, have eye glass cloth and spray in the next pocket and I use another pocket for spare coins."
4.0,"I hate carrying bags, so this was perfect when I didn't have enough pockets w carry my stuff. It's cute too!. the thing is I had this since like 6 months and now the pink and blue stuff are starting to fall of. other then that it looks pretty stylish. I actually ordered a second one because it was really good"
4.0,"Excellent quality but VERY thick and difficult to install....once in place it was very firm and not able to bend much around my wrist.  This is on my Rolex Submariner.  So, I took the band off (difficult again) and soaked in warm water on stove and then overnight to make more flexible.  No luck.  Reinstalled band and wearing today but not very comfortable.  If you have a large wrist this will work for you...average or small wrist then no, find a more flexible band which I have ordered.  This band is excellent quality, but be aware it is rather stiff until broken in."
4.0,Decent sweatshirt love that it doesn't shrink
4.0,Beautiful. Wish it was a little bigger.
4.0,"Love these tanks, however make sure to kept washed in cold water and air dry because the lace will mess up easily!"
4.0,"I purchased this to hold all of my documents while going on a trip abroad and it worked great! I was able to hold my passport, boarding passes, maps, money, entry tickets, hotel keys, and even all of my receipts in it. My only complaint is that the only pocket that fits a standard size map, can only hold 1 well, and 2 REALLY snugly. It was a bit dissapointing, but it was bearable. Overall, it is a great product that was perfect for what I needed!"
4.0,Too small for the size posted. About a half size off.
4.0,Do like them just wish the pouch had about 30% more room them would be perfect
4.0,"The boots were advertised as 8‚Äù but they had pictures of the 6‚Äù and ultimately I got the 6‚Äù boots delivered. They are really comfortable boots though, and very easy to get a parade gloss shine. Very smooth leather and the toe caps are solid."
4.0,Runs a bit small but still got good. Item is as described.
4.0,I loved how it looked but somewhat small and I'm a average size girl
4.0,"These shorts are comfortable, but pockets with zippers would have been an asset."
4.0,Just the right size and color ordered.
4.0,Gave it to my sister for a gift and she loved it!
4.0,BIG! And cute. A little heavy and tight on the nose. Great color!
4.0,"Fit great just super short, I would probably be ok but I wouldn‚Äôt be able dance or bend over...."
4.0,"The glasses are really nice. The size and shape and rose color was perfect for my hippie Halloween costume.  The ear piece is shaped like an arrow and was difficult to wear... grabbing, pulling my hair. I had to melt it with my crafty hot blower and reshape it to make it comfortable. I would buy again but would be careful not to order that type of ear piece."
4.0,"It was cute, it's so thin that I worry that it will break"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e48d7bd46025fa880b378bdd8ee0e6c8]] 100% Quality Earrings, simple packaging, THOUGH VERY FLAT.  Looked more cylindrical in photo and 2mm is misleading as it comes as a 10mm hoop, not only is it FLAT, but doesn't hug a babies ear as intended.<br />Sending back for a refund while still searching for the right hoop earring size."
4.0,I like this for my cards and it holds my phone also and quite neatly.
4.0,Very pretty. Fits as expected
4.0,Could be a great gift for anime fan but I bought it for my self.it wasn't to bad for the price. I one charm came loose on it but it's holding up well
4.0,A beautiful skirt and a nice fit! I ordered according to my waist size and not my hips because the skirt isn't a fitted skirt. This worked out great for me. I just had to put the skirt on and off over my head.
4.0,"Its long, wore it with leggings. A little thin for patty's normal sweated. Flattering."
4.0,Socks were a little small for the size 6-12 months indicated.<br />Very cute otherwise.
4.0,My son loves them! Only downfall is you have to charge them and if he losses the remote there are buttons on the inside to still turn them on and off!
4.0,"I wear a size 10 and that's what I ordered, however, the 10 was really tight and very uncomfortable....I knew I had to return them and it just so happened that this very stylish boot was available in size 11 which made me very happy...so I exchanged the size 10 for the 11 and it fits perfectly!!!"
4.0,"Material is not that soft, also little fabric balls all the pants."
4.0,"pretty, was going to restring as necklace, but have enjoyed using as a bracelet."
4.0,"Looks great. I am a mom of 2. Not in great shape, but with this suit I already got a lot of compliments."
4.0,I like the look and color of the watchband (dark red); The band has a classier look than the plastic bands with the button closure. I will definitely purchase more colors of this band.
4.0,Really awesome design and look but runs small.
4.0,"The product looks great and has a premium finish to it. However, I think the fit is a bit loose so better order .5 size smaller!"
4.0,The shirt fit great but a little disappointed in the color. I was expecting it to be a jade/emerald green like in the picture but it‚Äôs more a faded grayish green color. My boyfriend still loves it though
4.0,"Not as comfortable as it looks. Material is some what rough in texture however, it is decent quality. Sides have higher slits than expected."
4.0,"nicely made,leather feels very good ,the only thing is that  it is a hair to small for all my stuff."
4.0,"I ordered the size my granddaughter is currently wearing.  These shoes run significantly small and narrow.  They are beautiful.  Order up, at least, one size."
4.0,"This travel kit works fine but don't order it in grey. The grey looks like badly faded purple. I guess it doesn't really matter, no one is going to see it except me. Otherwise, it's fine."
4.0,"Love the dress! I purchased the pink floral dress.  I'm 5''4 and it comes just above my knees if I adjust the straps accordingly. IMPORTANT TO READ THE SIZE DESCRIPTION BECAUSE THE PRINT DRESSES MEASUREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE SOLIDS COLOR DRESSES!!!!  My size varies from a 12/14 depending on the make and style of clothing and I'm losing weight. I got a large and it fits perfectly with room to spare. I honestly could probably fit into a medium only because my breast are on the smaller side.  If you a size 14 with larger breast stick with the large.<br />Dress is very light and flowy. Material is thin (perfect for those hot and humid days) and just a ""tiny bit"" see though but not an issue for me....just wear nude under garments.  I gave it 4 stars because the straps are a little thin and could snap if your not careful while putting the dress on and off. Overall great buy for under 20 bucks!  Going to purchase more colors once I lose about 7-10 more pounds....but in a size medium."
4.0,"I think I have a weirdly shaped head, but these fit and and are comfortable, but light always comes in around the nose area no matter how I adjust it. It doesn't bother me too much though, and they're light and comfortable. I usually get headaches from wearing anything around my head but I never get a headache from these!<br /><br />I don't use the ear plugs."
4.0,"This dress was surprisingly well made for the price.  So many sequins!  They did drop off some but not too badly.  Was true to size or maybe a little large.  However, did not feel the fit was flattering on me."
4.0,Excellent! The head is a little big and flops down so you can't see anything. But maybe that's the point.....
4.0,too tight on my forearms i will need to wear t-shirts only under it  but i do like it I think its going to stretch out for me hope anyway
4.0,long. but really soft and stretchy. looks nice. just was really long for my 5'1 mom
4.0,A little smaller than I thought they would be byt very pretty and very shiney
4.0,I am really pleased with the bracelet. It looks great and the engraving is easy to read. The item came quickly which is always a plus. I would definitely buy an item again from this company.
4.0,"I like that you have several different lenses to utilize for different situations. Light weight, and comfortable to wear."
4.0,It beautiful but I was expecting it to be longer as shown on picture.
4.0,The swimsuit is too small for my daughter.But it is so cute and good quality. I don‚Äôt return it because I leave it to my younger daughter.
4.0,Nice! For the price
4.0,"Good quality, adjustable. It does make soft clinking noises when I move around, but overall, I love it."
4.0,"Go ""2"" sizes up , I normally wear a size 10 , that was too small , gave them away ! Ordered another in size 11 , they are too small ! I should have ordered size 12 , they would have been perfect ! (those chinese must have small feet)"
4.0,"It's quite lightweight and very warm.  There are some loose threads, but so far it's held up.  There are no inside pockets.  It just has the two flap pockets on the outside.  I find it to be a slightly tight in the shoulders and very baggy in the stomach area, but I'm V shaped, so it may not be a problem for most.  The extra room should be helpful for layering anyway.  The fabric is shinier than the first few photos.  The last few photos are more representative of how the material looks like in real life."
4.0,"It has POCKETS!! The only thing I don't like it the elastic in the waist. I should probably wear it with a belt to hide that, because I'm so short torso-ed it hits lower than an average person."
4.0,"looks good , work well"
4.0,These are the best touch screen gloves for driving that I have bought so far. They are warmer than any other pair. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is that eventually the touch screen interaction starts to degrade. I got 4 winters total out of 2 pairs of these before I started having problems with my car touch screen.<br /><br />Its a shame that these have been unavailable for the last couple of years.
4.0,"Like the style, dislike they have the little metal piece on the out side of shoe.  I think it would stay tighten if it was under the sole, with just the screw holes showing."
4.0,"Very Beautiful, Just A Little to Big for my Granddaughter, only being 7,  Nice item, Packaged very Nice"
4.0,"Beautifully made, just go a size up. I'm 5'7 and the length is perfect."
4.0,I ordered a medium and it fit as expected.
4.0,"I like the design and it's super cute, but it's a little smaller than expected. The dress is also NOT cotton; for whatever reason just by looking at the pictures I just assumed they were cotton. These are more like polyester/silk like material that stretches (which is quite comfortable to wear). These are also see through. Overall cute design, just make sure to order one size up, and be ready to wear something underneath/ wear nude colored underwear."
4.0,Good quality. However background creamier than pictured. Black image too small to wear without major contrast.
4.0,This is my second pair. I got a  9 last time this time I got a 10-11 and they fit very comfortably now. Cute and they can take being put in the wash machine
4.0,"They look fine, one seems a little smaller than the other by a tiny bit but both load and work fine"
4.0,"just what I wanted, made well and thin"
4.0,This is a keeper.  I was hesitant to order this as I haven't been successful in ordering dresses online.  I would say that this is a winner for me.  I did go up a size and glad I did.  The cut of the dress was classic yet trendy.<br />You can easily dress it up or pair with a jean jacket
4.0,"I bought as a gift but my friend loved it. Seems to be well worth it for a small purse made pretty well, also being diehard Deadpool fan made review go up."
4.0,"The dress is very tight fitting but soooo cute! If you don‚Äôt mind it being tight, then I would buy this. The dress is very summery and not very thin."
4.0,"Okay so this was a bit confusing to use. I thought I had to insert the bag strap somewhere because it was weird that the strap hooks are on opposite sides. I guess this is a good product for those who just bring their credit card, phone, and super tiny wallet. I usually carry small things but this bag unfortunately was not storing all my essentials. The bag strap also annoyed me as it took a while to adjust it to my liking (it was very tight!). This can be a great bag to go to a concert though! I would rate this 4.5 stars if I could. It's not a practical clutch for me, but it has potential to be great for someone else. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br />**Would also like to add that the phone holder fits my Nokia Lumia 1020, but I have a feeling it won't fit like an iPhone 6 Plus or Galaxy Note.<br />***I added pics to show what the bag looks like, the one that shows what's inside has sunglasses in it (if it's hard to tell)."
4.0,Great shirt except it‚Äôs too short. It will not stay tucked in. I bought a medium.
4.0,I highly recommend this dress. It‚Äôs well made and it‚Äôs very comfortable. The only thing I would recommend is to order a size up if you aren‚Äôt super comfortable with dresses that are tight fitting like me. I ordered a 2x when I would be normally an XL because the reviews said it was tight fitting. The waist is adjustable so you can make fit to your waist if it‚Äôs a little big. Other than that this dress is great for the price.
4.0,"these leggings look great!!! they're sooo flattering and so comfy and breathable. one con is that the waistband tends to roll over. I have actual gymshark leggings and i don't experience that problem with the real ones. I've worn these amazon leggings to workout twice now (one HIIT workout and one yoga) and the waistband kept rolling over for both. That might be enough reason for me to not get these in other colors... but they're just so flattering, so i keep going back and forth on it!"
4.0,I love the sign of course.  I just wish it was bigger.
4.0,Great dress for summer! Easy to pack for travel. Doesn‚Äôt wrinkle. Comfortable fabric. I have bought several dresses of this brand. I really like them all.
4.0,"Got all 7 pieces of the set, seem good. Only time will tell on durability."
4.0,Exactly what I was wanting/expecting. I'm glad it wasn't curlier or I might have had a hard time putting it in.
4.0,"The top of the view does NOT give 100% clear view like your regular vision.  If I look just over the top of the glasses I see just a bit more clearly but I would say they are about a .25 at the top, .5 in the middle and 1.0 at the bottom with no transition visible.  This is my first pair of transition and they work very well for jobs that require significant focal distance changes on the fly (air traffic controller).  We have to look at close-up strips of paper, then look over to a radar scope, then further over to other scopes, then to computers the other way and finally weather monitors on the walls behind us.  These give pretty good coverage for me.<br /><br />I wear an XL motorcycle helmet, Large to XL baseball cap and can't remember the mm of my helmet off hand but these are just a bit tight.  I bent the nose pads to give me more relief for distance and they work fairly well.  Not the most comfortable glasses I have ever worn but they are good for the price and work for 2 to 3 hours at a time.  If you just need them for an hour at a time before taking a break from them...these are good."
4.0,nice shirt...good quality...good color...great price...bought mine one size up for the loose fit these I wanted
4.0,"These are comfortable and made of soft stretchy material, but the sizing chart is incorrect.  This is my third order of the same product as the medium and large were too small; I settled for the XL.  I only have a 32&#34; waist, so this was surprising to me, as I have never purchased XL underwear before. In addition to the waist and leg measurements being conservative, the pouches in these underwear are definitely on the smaller side.  I would have given them 5 starts if the pouch size was increased by 25-30%."
4.0,"This is a fine quality of t-shirt but as you can see from the picture I submitted, the color is a bit different from the pink on the listing and also the Hello Kitty in the cup of noodles is a bit smaller on the front than was is pictured on the listing. Just wanted people to be aware of that. But the t-shirt if still very nice and my daughter loves it. It is true to size, this is a large and it is a good fitting large, not tight. I washed it right away and it did not seem to shrink or peel in any way. I ordered this very last minute and selected same day shipping, it arrived same day as I asked! That was a plus because her Birthday was that day."
4.0,Very pretty statement piece
4.0,"The stitching on the border of one of the five is unraveling after one wash, otherwise these are nice bandannas. I'll probably order a set of red soon."
4.0,"Someone had posted that the medium fit like a regular medium but I would have to say it fits a little small.  I am a 34B and it just fits.  Hope it doesn't shrink.  Otherwise, it is a super cute tank and hangs great."
4.0,"Lighter weight than expected for sterling silver, but I didn‚Äôt read the full description that stated that this ring is plated. Not quite as sparkly as in the photo, but, for the price, I‚Äôm not complaining. Very affordable and comfortable fit. A nice item to wear for the occasional formal event."
4.0,Clean purchase delivery and item as expected.
4.0,Simply put good quality. Fit perfectly. Easy replacement
4.0,"A very pretty and flattering casual shirt - At the time I bought it I was 145 lbs and am 5'7&#34;, the medium was perfect"
4.0,Great quality could have been a little cheaper
4.0,It is very pretty.  A little too heavy for me.
4.0,"Its cute, covers the tops of my ears, and is super warm.  Its a little big front to back, in that it slides down my face if I'm like wearing a hood over it, but for the most part I love it.  I could maybe wish it covered the entire ear, but that has to do more with style than size I think.  The texture of the yarn is a little rough, but since its lined, I don't notice it when I'm wearing it."
4.0,It is exactly as I expected and will serve my purposes perfectly.
4.0,"This skirt is so cute!  After reading the reviews I ended up buying a medium, but should‚Äôve stuck with the small.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 124 lbs. with long legs and was afraid a small would be too short/tight.  It hits mid thigh and after washing and drying it fit a lot better.  It did stretch out as I wore it throughout the day.  Stick with your normal sizing on this.  Do not size up"
4.0,These pants are adorable and I was psyched about getting these. The waist is ridiculously small compared to the sizing for the rest of the pants. I had to return them.
4.0,"Very very comfy, but only thing was that it was a little bigger than i thought.<br />I recommend it very much though"
4.0,"I normally wear a Large or size 12. That is what I bought and it fit as expected. I bought white and you can see right through it. It is a nice fit.  I would buy it again, just not in white."
4.0,wish it would fit
4.0,Can be found for cheaper. Is made in china.
4.0,"Ordered for brothers birthday. Fits him well and he loves them. His only issue were the lack of pockets. However, what basketball player plays with pockets?"
4.0,It is beautiful and looks great. I just wish the chain was a bit longer.
4.0,Very cute- but coming apart in places. Strong odor.
4.0,This lanyard is really beautiful and the snaps work great.  The chain is not heavy but not too thin.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars is because there are links in the chain that are connected together funny and look like kinks.  I'm not concerned because its just for work and it doesn't look that bad.  I've gotten a lot of compliments and it really is beautiful.
4.0,"As far as the ring itself, great, good size, feels good, after a while you don't even realize it is there, perfect for work with tools, beach, pool, sports, etc.  As far as the color, it matches the order but I would definitely get the black next time, blue doesn't look as serious as I thought.  Only suggestion, allow the option to place the order (set of 2) with 2 different colors. Also a suggestion extend the color options and maybe different color patters Best Regards"
4.0,I love the outfit and the way it fit.<br /><br />It is well made
4.0,"LOVE! I wasn't sure what to expect, but I love Nina Queen beads - the enameling is so pretty. This bangle is so pretty and all my beads fit nicely. I'd buy another if they come out with other colors. (Green- hint, hint!)"
4.0,"I love this bag! It's bigger than I thought, but not too big. It's perfect for what I needed, which is my work bag. I take my college books with me, plus my lunch and drinks and I can easily fit everything I need inside. It seems sturdy, the material seems thick. We will see in a few weeks how it holds up...I'm pretty hard on stuff. The rope handles are super soft. If I had a gripe, one of the anchors has some black spots on it. The pom pom thing is not my style, but I took it off and now my cat has a new toy lol. So I'm glad it's removable."
4.0,i guess its nice but its too big a small would have worked. i am 5'7 136lb slim built
4.0,"Love this dress. So sexy but classy and perfect for a tropical vacation. The only thing is if ya got big boobs, the top doesnt stay put if you bend down to pick something up. Love it anyways!"
4.0,"As I bought this i thought it looked cool and then I read the comments, so i was regretful about buying it and was going to return it.  It arrived very soon and when I got it I took everything back, the material is like plastic but it is like a real windbreaker, it is true to size honestly and has a snug fit, nice look, white is see through, it was raining and I went out for a walk, the rain level was medium so it did really good, looks really nice and is a good buy, only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is because the material could be a little better, other than that it is one of the best buys on the windbreakers."
4.0,Definitely agree with another girl that if you have a tummy this dress will show it. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs super clingy it‚Äôs just the way it hangs. The fabric is that weird silky swimsuit stuff (which isn‚Äôt bad persay) that I‚Äôm not personally a fan of but it feels pretty comfortable on.  It looks exactly like the pic and is nice and long.  If I can find a comfortable body shaper and lose some of this spare tire I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing more!
4.0,"This a great sweatshirt.  The printing isn't all that great, but perhaps the way it's supposed to look.  I like it anyway"
4.0,"Tight after knees and slips down, but worth the price. Probably would fit great on slimmer legs!"
4.0,"Directions are printed on the packages and are a little hard to read.  I wish there was a paper that came with them.  Otherwise, they are great!"
4.0,Gift for the best Mom in the Galaxy and she loved it. So glad I found it.
4.0,It's a little tight around the mid section
4.0,I knew it would be a little larger than I needed but that's ok it's comfy.  I washed it in cold water on gentle cycle with only my swimming suit and the bottom unraveled a lot. I was able to trim it of with scissors and it's fine. If not for that I would have given 5 stars.
4.0,"Am giving these as a present, so I really don't know about the accuracy of the fit, but they sure are cute."
4.0,"I ordered this because of all of the reviews that said it worked during pregnancy (I am six months along). I like the fit, like the style, and I am OKAY with the color.... but it is not what it said it would be. Definitely more of a rust orange, not red at all, and not like pictured."
4.0,Nice Insulated leggings. Perfect for for ice skating classes.
4.0,"The finger touch isn't the greatest, I can click on things on my phone but it isn't very precise. They do keep my hands warm enough when putting around outside the house in Northern California winter weather (mid to high 30s as the low)."
4.0,"Surprisingly, thick good quality material. Definitely order two sizes-up! It's pretty long on me (5'3&#34;). It could almost pass for a dress!"
4.0,"Just what I needed on a recent trip overseas; an RFID wallet and passport holder in one. Nice make. Nice materials. Odd odor. I hope it's nothing toxic. I found this same design on Amazon from several dealers. The photos of products from this seller showed a better make (straighter stitching) than the other. This one was a few dollars more, but still a great price for a good quality item."
4.0,though it was very light - it wasn't very sturdy -
4.0,"Like the style of the dress. The fabric is a little sheer/thin. Would recommend wearing something seamless underneath.  Overall, cute dress for the price."
4.0,"I love the way this feels, however it‚Äôs a bit see through."
4.0,Came on a nice box and the glasses are cute and not too heavy. The only issue I have is with where the frame sure on the nose. It doesn't stay taught so often slides down my face.
4.0,"Protects privacy, but the elastic strap would be better if it were a money clip"
4.0,"Fabric is high quality‚Äî no see- through, great support without too much compression. Fit very flattering; would give a five  but I ordered the pr with cross- cross on sides but mine were solid. Disappointed about that‚Äî otherwise would definitely order several pair!"
4.0,"Perfect size for pandora bracelet. However the description DOES say ""white"" but the stock picture looks silver. I was hoping it would look as the stock photo did.<br />Amazon Prime SUCKS anymore. Nothing comes in 2 or even 4days anymore. Waited a MONTH for a tshirt that was supposed to be PRIME!!!!<br />Basically the only reason I pay for prime..."
4.0,Everything from my old bulky wallet fit into this new wallet and still maintained a slim profile.
4.0,"Pens√© usarlas para el fr√≠o por el cuello pero son demasiado delgadas aunque eso fue quiz√° error m√≠o porque en realidad por el precio que tienen estan bien; bajo una sudadera o chamarra o encima de otro blusa de tirantes o algo as√≠,podr√≠an funcionar. Me gusta la tela y el ajuste y repito son delgadas ,s√≥lo para que no se equivoque como yo,pero por lo que cuestan ,es lo justo."
4.0,Bought for my grandson and he loves it
4.0,"Lots of places for credit cards, insurance cards, etc.  The leather is of quality leather and it's small to fit in a small purse"
4.0,Super cute. Had a really deep v cut for the neck like but if you have a swim suit under it you'll be fine.
4.0,It was perfect looks better than the picture I loved it...
4.0,I can definitely say that I appreciated the reliability of this carrier.
4.0,Pocket tore off within the first couple months but it can be mended
4.0,"I Really like the color and the sturdiness of this purse, carry it everyday"
4.0,"I expected it to be a bit longer. In the photo it seems lilw it would hit right at or maybe slightly above the knee... but it just covers my bottom. I do think its versatile though. I will be using it as a swim cover, but i will also wear it a layering piece for dresses or camis"
4.0,"This dress fit super well, and the stretch made it very comfortable. Everything about it fit really nicely. The V isn't too deep, even on someone busty like myself. Not too short in the front but lengthened my legs and the front was very slimming.<br />My only issue was that the back is completely flat, so it doesn't provide quite the same slimming effect as the front does. And though I ordered ""green"" and was hopeful it was just a weird picture, the dress in a fact a vibrant blue color. I really need a green dress or I'd have kept it, but I'm very seriously considering the red for another event soon."
4.0,Everything about this product is top quality. The glasses are real Coach and made of good material. The glasses case however did not seal right and looks like it was smashed before the packaging because the box was perfectly intact. Hard to get a hold of the company too. But I have a feeling that my order was an outlier.
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised. These pocket squares are a nice firm quality. They are not 10&#34; but 8&#34;. They are smaller but are firm enough to fold well.<br />I am not a one time prom or wedding pocket square user. I wear them often. I like looking sharp, I am a man of dapperness, and haberdashery.<br />These will work well even though not 10&#34;."
4.0,I like the way fit me !!!
4.0,they felt pretty comfy
4.0,"They're a really cute look, but the backing of them on each pair is way too loose and is constantly falling off."
4.0,size ran a little small.
4.0,The strap going around the ankle is a little small and tight I have small ankles.  I think it will give a little with wear other wise I love them.  I wont use the bow and there is no way to attach it so you have to figure that out.  They look GREAT without the flower.  Very sexy look.  Looks very expensive.  I plan to buy them in the brown also.
4.0,Really liked these. Mostly the pants do not ride although it does roll down my belly. Best part is the it feels cool and not sticky or sweaty as you start really moving.
4.0,Loved this outfit! Super cute and light weight and good material
4.0,Good. As advertised.
4.0,"Loved the pockets in this bag. However it is a bit small, so when I put my daily items in it, such as workout gloves, glasses, keys, extra jacket, etc, it filled up quickly and was too small to carry everything I needed.  The dimensions of 18"" x 13"" is a bit smaller than my previous bag of 19"" x 15"", and those extra inches do matter."
4.0,These bands are much more comfortable than the band that comes with the Fitbit and as a bonus lots of colors to choose from. Like them
4.0,"super cute, comfy dress, better without the belt and one pocket was smaller than the other but, overall a great little dress at a really good sale price"
4.0,Lite weight.
4.0,"Pretty comfortable, but if you live in a snowy or icy climate, you need treads on the bottom, or forget about wearing them. SUPER slippery on snow or ice...even just a fine dusting of snow and you'll be on your ass if you're not careful."
4.0,I like the colors but wish it had already been formed in the loop.
4.0,Est√°n lindos c√≥modos pero la calidad no es muy buena
4.0,The dress itself was actually very flattering but the sleeves were just a little too scratchy for me on my arms. The sleeves are a mesh tulle like fabric. Make sure you check the size chart I had to go up a few sizes for the right fit. Cute but returned due to the sleeves and having sensitive skin.
4.0,Bought for my 14 yearr old daughter who loves them.  I specifically let her choose post earrings that are surgical stainless steel as she only had her ears pierced 3 months ago and surgical stainless steel is what the earrings the piercing was done with.  Unfortunately her skin is very sensitive and did react to these earrings so she can only wear them for a limited time.  Had to purchase a pair of 14K gold earrings that she is doing much better with.
4.0,Beautiful Ring!! Runs Big
4.0,Nice fit and confortable.
4.0,"Good material, I like that they have the adjustable nose pieces instead of the stationary bridge like most glasses like these have. They are a bit small for my head as I am a stocky man but good otherwise."
4.0,My daughter loved these earrings  - so many to choose from!!
4.0,For the price...great
4.0,I like the plugs and they look great but because the back and from cover the hole in your ear it doesn't allow your piercing to breath causing a lot of build up. I will wear them because they are so cute. I just don't wear them all the time.
4.0,Bought them for my son and I'm not sure if he's taken them off yet! Says they are very comfortable and he can wear them outside.<br />We'll see if they hold up
4.0,"The opening doesn‚Äôt stretch quite enough to easily put your foot through. Otherwise, they‚Äôre great and so unique!"
4.0,"I am currently 16 weeks pregnant and fit a size 6/8. I bought a large and the bottoms fit phenomenally, but the top was made for a B cup! I have to buy a second one at a larger size for my breasts which are Ds right now. It would be nice to be able to mix n match top and bottom sizes. It is a very well made suit though that seems very durable!"
4.0,Fits nicely. Super sheer..
4.0,Perfect wedding jewelry. Hang down on the ear more than I would of expected. Looked beautiful on everyone.
4.0,Very nice dress for kids.. looks beautiful but suspenders bit large for 1 year old baby.
4.0,Love this dress so much even though it is a little snug in the arms
4.0,My daughter liked the color. We used the dress for a costume party. She received compliments.
4.0,Got what I paid for. Very nice necklace but the string broke the minute my daughter put it on. But the seller was so nice to work with me with the matter. Very happy customer now great customer service
4.0,"Let me first off say the sizing chart is pretty correct. I bought a medium and I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 160 pounds,  and it fits perfectly.<br /><br /> It is very reflective, though not as reflective as the reflectoes vests.  It is a nice gray color during the day. It is a rain jacket primarily as it is a plastic/vinyl material and will not breathe.  There is no mesh liner material or anything like that inside .  It has a  zipper pocket in the lower back And a large vent in the upper back. The cuffs are elastic and also have Velcro adjustments.  It uses the women‚Äôs configuration for a front zipper--minus1 star!<br /><br />I think it is perfect for motorcycle or scooter riding to maintain visibility to all traffic, and doubles as a rain jacket.... that‚Äôs what I use it for."
4.0,I totally like this little cute necklace and if the chain was a little bit longer I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,They are soft and comfortable. They are a bit longer than I expected. They arrived very quickly.
4.0,"Great all around ditty bags to hold whatever medium weight objects you desire. Strong and durable, and light."
4.0,Mixed feelings but it works
4.0,Quality seems good but runs small.
4.0,It‚Äôs more of a swimsuit material so it was great as a coverup but nothing more.
4.0,I like the material but they were a little on the small side
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute. It‚Äôs a lot shorter in the front than the back.
4.0,"While I might order these in a larger size, I was disappointed in the waistband. The elastic is not attached, rather just floating in the casing of the waistband. It often gets twisted or folded over whenever I wear these. I am careful to make sure that the elastic is flat when I put them on or pull them up and that way, it feels comfortable and looks good under a form fitting blouse or T-shirt.  I like the fabric and comfort of these pants. I like that they fit comfortably and snugly, but not tight, in the seat and the waistband. I like the fullness in the legs, but they are not too wide. The length is perfect for me. Although I am 5'4&#34;, I have long legs and need my pants to be longer than petite length or at or above my ankle. I ordered them in a large and they come down just as in the photo. I could wear a heeled shoe with these pants and they would not be too short. With my flat shoes, they cover the tops of my feet, but do to drag on the floor. I will wash them on the wrong side on a gentle or hand wash cycle in the washer. they are very comfortable pants and are great for all sorts of wear."
4.0,"It is definitely a great piece for both the person who wants it for fashion and the person wants it for actual usage. The only slip up might be that sometimes if stretched too much, there may be a little too much space between the beads."
4.0,"These are really cute, though I really wish they came as a 4 pack because they fit easily into a standard pierced ear, but I've been wearing them in my second holes pretty consistently. I'm giving 4 stars because they won't stay in unless you wear a clear back and I feel like that defeats the style and purpose for this type of earring. I like them, I'm not sure I would replace them if I lost them."
4.0,colors dont show underneath white pants
4.0,"Nice, quality material. Bigger than expected."
4.0,Looks good. Works well. Makes more noise than it should. Motor whines. Not very loud but it is supposed to be quiet.
4.0,I finally wore out another cloth I had been using.  This is a large cloth - so I expect it  will last me quite awhile.  I use this cloth to keep the jewelry that is on display in my store bright and shiny.  We are near the beach - so things can tarnish quickly.  It is easy to use and doea a great job.
4.0,The bottom half is too small so when you close the robe it doesn't close all the way
4.0,Just wish they were a half inch longer.
4.0,"I really love this blouse, and material and would really love to purchase more.  However, I noticed that the material pills where I wear my seat belt.  Maybe I will purchase another but remember to wear a wrap just for that."
4.0,Super cute! The only thing is that the skirt is a slightly different shade than the leotard part and makes the skirt look orange. My daughter noticed that right away. It‚Äôs for a Christmas dance.
4.0,Arrived as expected. Very happy with size & look
4.0,This was ok very unique an was very soft
4.0,Purchase for my husband he loves them
4.0,This a lovely dress and fits well. I don't love the heart shaped buttons because I'm not 10 and I deducted one star because two of the button holes are sewn shut. Overall a great buy and with such a classic silhouette it will become a year round staple.
4.0,"These are nice quality pants. Order your true size or else they will be see through! Fit well, holds everything in, good price point. So many people have been raving about them and whereas I like them, I just don't find them to be super spectacular!"
4.0,They fit as expected and seem to wash well. One other reviewer commented that his socks shrank in the first wash and he subsequently had to give them to his child. Mine have gone through two wash cycles so far and still fit my size 9 feet.
4.0,"Really nice, would be 5 stars if they were bigger"
4.0,Love this. The cut is awesome and it's very pretty. Fit is perfect.
4.0,"I hate carrying bulky wallet. With cellphone in pocket, I really don't have too many things for wallet. The slim and low profile of this wallet attracts me. The only downside is the clip. I don't seem to find a good way to use the clip, as I don't clip wallet to my belt, and I don't use it to clip my paper bill.<br /><br />If you can find a good way to take advantage of the included clip, I would highly recommend this wallet."
4.0,One of my favorites. Be careful thought the pockets will easily tear
4.0,Great quality and model. The only issue is that its itchy...looks very nice and stylish
4.0,"excellent product adjusted very well to the clock, I liked it very much"
4.0,It fit like it was tailored for my body but not a lot of wiggle room. Reminded me to sit up straight and keep my stomach sucked in. I bought it because it has the same pattern as a shirt my husband has and I wanted to get a corny pic of us all matchy-matchy in Hawaii. Mission accomplished.
4.0,Bought this for an inexpensive work watch. Very rugged but stylish. Well lit backlight and very clear digital display. The casing is plastic and I anticipate the silver like coating will eventually chip off but its a very nice watch for the price.
4.0,The color was not as bright but felt well made for the price. I really wanted something lighter and not so typical green.
4.0,Great fabric and I love that you can fold the bill along the crease in the middle and put in your pocket or bag with out it taking up all you extra space.
4.0,"I nice pair of sunglasses, and they look nice."
4.0,"Fit beautifully and feel like skin, highly recommended."
4.0,I always wear a large in tshirts. I ordered a large and it fit like a medium right out of the box. It turned into a small after I washed it. Definately get a size up from what you usually wear. Cool box too.
4.0,Great dress. Giving it 4 stars b/c I was hoping it would be just a bit longer so I could wear it to work
4.0,"this ring is really cool, really niceÔºÅjust really eazy to broke"
4.0,"These are really nice biker shorts, but they are much shorter than what is shown.  I am not a huge fan of the shorter, but they still fit great and are comfortable.  They seem to fit to size though."
4.0,"This is a really cute dress.  Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too tight for me. I normally wear a size small and ordered this in a size medium hoping the dress wouldn't be too snug. It was too fitting around the mid section for my liking. Wish it had been a bit looser."
4.0,"As others have noted it runs small, or at least is a bit too snug for me. I have a 36&#34;waist and ordered a large, I fit into it but it's tight. I'll give it an it and see, maybe it'll stretch a bit. Also the 'blue' color is more purple. Don't get me wrong, it has blue in it, but the background color is purple."
4.0,Wanted a bag with the Hudson Bay stripes and this one wasn't too expensive.  It isn't made of the thickest material but it will work for lighter items.
4.0,"As advertised, tho quite translucent and thin. For serious stuff, prob need two, or just the  one to help with a snow poncho.."
4.0,This is a great shoe I receive a lot f compliments. I will say they are pretty narrow but I do have fat feet.
4.0,I like them so far
4.0,I bought this for casual summer wear and love it. It's very soft
4.0,my daughter Loves it
4.0,"Decent shirt, don't pay too much for it, though. Anything more than $20-$25 is too much."
4.0,"I thought this was a really cute. I would like to get a version of this, though that was a little more sturdily made and that would last. This is cute for a few wears."
4.0,The dress is beautiful and it looks great however it can damage very easily. I noticed some chaffing of the fabric across my chest caused by a seatbelt. Had to place a jacket across my chest to prevent further damage. Buy knowing that you have to take care of the fabric or it will wear easily.
4.0,Rings fit very well. Make sure to take off before being around water.
4.0,Like this item for summer piece!
4.0,Being a tall girl it's a litle but short but it is beautiful and as expected
4.0,I love my watch it is beautiful. The only think I don't like is the heart rate it not accurate. I take it off the charger and it is 84 I put it on and it does not change for at least an hour. Seems to stay at 62 to 67 even when I am on the treadmill. My treadmill records bpm and it is 132 sometimes. This watch has never recorded anything higher than 84 and that is when it is off my wrist on the charge. Very disappointed and I looked forward to monitor my heart rate.  And yes I have it on my wrist as they recommended.
4.0,Very Cute but bottoms Fits a little big I got size Small it‚Äôs not Small it‚Äôs more like medium the top fits perfectly
4.0,Much more green then picture shows and a little small but very realistic and good for costumes.
4.0,Will report in more detail after I wear them. Too warm for this time of year in CaliforniaüòÄ
4.0,"Love the size of this pearls, surely looks beautiful & can recommend this to everyone.."
4.0,too long should have petite sizing avaliable
4.0,need clarity of  frame size definition.
4.0,"Very nice quality, I was pleasantly surprised at just how nice it is in person.<br /><br />One thing that you may not be aware of without seeing it in person is that the letter/numbers that represent the day/date in the center of the watch are very muted, so the watch maintains a nice black look in the center.  It is very difficult to see the day/date in low lighting, and there is no glow/illumination option to see it in the dark.  The day/date letters/numbers get brighter as the ambient light around the watch get lighter, but are never bright.  While this does not bother me, it may bother some.<br /><br />The arms on the watch do glow in the dark, but again, if you're in the dark for a while you will not be able to see the arms.<br /><br />The crystal is super clear and the watch does have a very nice build quality overall."
4.0,Could be cheaper
4.0,Colour is true to photo. Very soft material.  Lovely dress.
4.0,Loves it. Fits my 3 year old well. The colors are not as light as the picture but it‚Äôs still a cute shoe.
4.0,Easy to wipe off.  Did not leave a residue. My glasses do fog up a little but I can still see through.  Before they would totally fog up and I would have to take them off.
4.0,Bought this for a wedding last minute! It‚Äôs super cute and we love it! The only thing we weren‚Äôt a fan of was the tie in the back for the dress it wasn‚Äôt easy to do. But it looks great!
4.0,I could have gone down a size but oh well. It‚Äôs super comfy and super cute.
4.0,Really pretty but very thin fabric..easily pulls - be careful
4.0,Great product! Just took about a month to arrive.
4.0,"I wear size xl and 185 pounds, the back was high rise and allowed me to wear my bra under it cause my boob is 36DDD .. the material is also very good"
4.0,Perfect but the hair keeps falling out!
4.0,"My wife ordered these for herself.  I was worried the screws would look too large or over sized.<br /><br />When they arrived, I realized I was way off.  They look the normal size of a screw.<br /><br />She did not have any trouble putting them in.  After getting them in she could not get 1 of them back out and I had to help.<br /><br />If anyone else has this problem what I did to remove was, cover everything with neosporin, spin it like I was unscrewing and slowly increased pressure while turning until it came out.  I was worried it was going to rip the lower half of her ear off, only the threaded area got stuck.  Her ear was swollen for 2 days, she gave them to my daughter who had no trouble putting them in.  (she wears alot of fake/psudo plugs with larger posts so these fit her fine)  It took me maybe 3 or 4 minutes of carefully trying to get it out so her ear didnt rip.  (I cant stress this enough, she got them in fine, but it was stomach turning to see how far the skin was stretching taking it out)<br /><br />Only giving it a 4 star rating because they got stuck.  Not sure if it was part of the earring threading being off or 1 of her earring holes deciding to grab on.<br /><br />Nice pair of earrings, they are my daughters now.  They look good, would recommend."
4.0,Beautiful but a little awkward to wear.
4.0,The necklace is so delicate and beautiful!  I have gotten many compliments on how pretty it looks.  Anyone would enjoy this piece of jewelry!
4.0,"Pretty bracelet, fits well"
4.0,Very cute. Look just like the picture.
4.0,This  fits great. I am 5 foot seven and about 125 pounds. I do wish it was a little longer in the front. But it's very cozy and I think I will get a lot of use out of it.
4.0,they seem very comfortable and warm...
4.0,I ordered a 2xl which should have easily fit me but they were just a bit too tight for comfort. The material seemed pretty good though.
4.0,Love the material...Wear with a busy necklace.
4.0,"The fit was fine for my big gord, 7 3/4. The hat is real dry. Rubbed mine down with hand lotion. Didn't over do it, just enough so you feel smooth coating not dry."
4.0,it is small in size and took advice to order size up and worked well
4.0,Great Fit! Fit my daughter perfectly.
4.0,"I love the design and style; perfect replacement for one I lost years ago. My only complaint is that safety chain broke immediately.  I work in jewelry, so  I ordered a new safety chain to attach and secure. I know how to fix and make SS 925 jewelry. Worth it for me, but wonder if unskilled ladies would be  unhappy/frustrated."
4.0,"As described, looks great with tops that need a bit extra."
4.0,iDoesnt seem to authentic weird shape
4.0,i liked it but it is cut in the back too much and shows a lot of bra
4.0,Had to return because it was too small. But very pretty.
4.0,good ear rings for a great price.
4.0,This dress is cute but unforgiving in the mid-section...don't get if you have concerns about that area
4.0,.. bought this for seven dollars with free shipping .. it is stamped with the name and titanium on the inside .. I bought this to replace my husbands wedding ring because it is two heavy and hurts his arthritic fingers .. the only downfall is he imprinting on the inside .. because it takes up a good half of the inside of the ring ..
4.0,very beautifull ...perfect
4.0,"This is a cute bodysuit, not swimwear. The material is very thin and would become transparent in water. I knew this when ordering and I specifically wanted a white off the shoulder bodysuit for a specific skirt. I am satisfied with the product, I just wish there were snaps in the crotch....completely undressing to use the bathroom is a negative. I will add snaps myself. I do recommend the top but keep in mind sizing is a little off. I am 5'5&quot;, weigh 150, 36D, and hourglass shape, I ordered a medium and it is a little big on me, but I think a small would show my bellybutton, so I am sticking with the medium."
4.0,Lo use para fotos de embarazo y qued√≥ perfecto. Compre la talla M.<br />Peso 147 lb<br />Altura:poco mas de 5 pies
4.0,"My husband ordered the shirts for his workouts. These shirts are a steal for the price. I tend to destroy workout clothes, so hate spending $20-30 a shirt. They are comfortable and allow freedom of movement. The only drawback is that they are not tapered, so it's a very boxy fit. Not the athletic cut I expected."
4.0,"I love the style and shape of this shirt.  The colors are fantastic and it just looks good.  A teenager or mature woman would look good in it.  I think it runs small though and I'd say you need to size up at least one size. It's not very thick either so some might want to wear a cami or shell top under it.  Overall, I love its look but just be aware about the size."
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this dress - love that it has pockets and long sleeves!  Material has some stretch and the tie waist is a nice touch.  I paired it with knee high boots, it really works for professional or casual wear."
4.0,"Seems well made and should work well in cold, windy weather"
4.0,"These are really neat! I am constantly losing sunglasses so I was really happy to receive this pair of sunglasses for free in exchange for a review. I love the idea of sunglasses that will fold up and not be a big bulky thing in your bag waiting to get crushed while you're not using them and I'm psyched to use them.<br />It wasn't obvious to me at from the pics online, but these fold up not just at the nose bridge, but also at the arms, so they are a tight little package. Then you can slide the whole thing into the microfiber lined pouch they send you.<br />I'm going to go outside and see how they work in the sun.<br />Ok they seem to work fine in the sun. They say they have a UV400 rating. They fit my face, which is kind of a miracle, since sunglasses are notoriously terrible for Asian faces. These were actually wide enough for my head and did not sit on my cheeks. I also put them on some white people and they fit them fine too (of course).<br />One issue: the right arm's halfway fold kept flopping down. You know when you hold your sunglasses with the arms pointing up as you're about to put them on your face? Yeah, in that posittion the right arm kept flopping down halfway. I am not sure if i can tighten the screw or if it will strip the threads."
4.0,Fits nice but somewhat large. Should‚Äôve ordered a medium but overall it‚Äôs a nice dress and good quality
4.0,"very light weight and easy to read. I use it for a stop watch mostly,but it also is a good time piece"
4.0,This scarf is soft and warm. Great winter accessory for bundling up while still looking cute and fashionable.
4.0,"So it just arrived. My first thought was wow it's a lot darker then the picture. But besides the shade, looks nice and feels great. No bad smells or anything like that from packaging. I just really wish the peole who took the photo kept it more true to it's color cause I would liked a brighter color. Regardless of I still do like the bag. The color is more of a pewter blue. Then a Jean colored blue."
4.0,Loved this item however the back are not super supportive. Had to use different backs right away. But very fashionable and a great statement piece.
4.0,Love the shirt ordered a 10 received an XL could have been tighter but I worked out
4.0,whish they were a bit smaller but still good quality.
4.0,"I always get compliments when I wear this necklace.  But, it is a bit annoying that the two layered necklace gets twisted often.  Otherwise, it's beautiful and I enjoy wearing it."
4.0,only dislike is the zippers are stiff to open.  i'll try some lubricant.  other than that its well worth the money.
4.0,Lost one yesterday. Beautiful product but the pin catch is not closing
4.0,Could be longer. Fits too snug
4.0,First for all the people saying that the glove don't fit or move easily the box says right on it that it is &#34;NOT A TOY&#34; it is a replica made to be displayed and showed off. I would have gave the glove 5 stars instead of 4 stars but for 2 reason I had to give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />1. The box came in and looked as if it had already been opened missing both the tape from the top & bottom of the box. Also where the box had been glued in the factory it was about 70% coming apart forcing me to remove the glove from the box to put some tape on the inside to hold the box together. (Since the glove was now out the box I gave it a closer look)<br /><br />2. The knives are not soldered on but instead glued on & colored in to give the look of them being soldered on. As I can tell by all the white glue still showing on one of the fingertips where the knife is attached.<br /><br />All in all it is still a nice piece added to my collection.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00L1M5THU NECA Nightmare on Elm Street - Prop Replica - Freddy Krueger &#34;Dream Warriors&#34; Glove]]
4.0,"I usually wear a 12 in a tankini top and a 10 in bottoms, so usually buy tops and bottoms separately.  The LARGE top fit fine-a little squishy on the girls, but not uncomfortable. The size L bottoms were OK, but if you are more a 12-14 than a 10-12, I'd go with an XL.  Since the top is fairly fitted, (and has some white!) I plan to wear it with a high-waisted bottom that I purchased separately.<br />  It is a great pattern, and I like the mix of blue and black, and a great price as well!"
4.0,Great coat but the zipper gets stuck in the fur every time you zip it
4.0,"A very loose and flowy dress. The material feels cooling to the skin. I got this in a small but it's quite oversized, however with a belt it looks OK and can be dressed up or down. I haven't worn it out yet since the weather has gotten cooler but I see myself being able to dress it up or down."
4.0,You have to wait awhile for braking in.
4.0,"Should be five stars, except the cloth was found to be a little thinner than expected. However, I actually like them this way. I will buy again."
4.0,Granddaughter loved the dress and it was perfect for the July 4th celebration!
4.0,I like this but make sure to buy larger than you normally wear.
4.0,Cute but definitely not long.
4.0,"These leggings are more like thick, footless tights. They fit my daughter and she is comfortable in them. They don't ride up in the legs or roll down in the waist."
4.0,I returned it because it didnt fit.
4.0,I received my dress today and I must say I was impressed with the time it got here and how great it fit. I sent in my measurements and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I ordered the burgundy color and it‚Äôs looks very beautiful. Happy with this purchase.
4.0,"Missing part of a set of earrings, but the earrings I did get, are fun and fashionable. I get compliments on them all day long. They're lightweight and dont irritate my ears. I wish the longer ones were a tiny bit shorter,  because they hit my shoulders. I tried to trim a pair, but it didnt work out well."
4.0,Great quality.  Soft. I didn't want them fitted but there's way to much fabric between the crotch and waist band on me.  If I pull them up so they don't gap on my butt the waist comes up way past my belly button.  I'm going to reorder in a small.
4.0,Very dainty so be careful. Shorter than stated but looks good on.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a nice bodysuit it‚Äôs just super tight, I usually wear a xs but got a small on this and it was just way to tight.<br />If you are going to get it maybe get a size up."
4.0,Love it! Perfect feel.. Perfect fit.. Value for money.. very descent..
4.0,"I thought the robe would be a little heavier,  but it is relatively nice robe for the price. My Guy seems to really like it and actually asked me to purchase another one, so I'd call the purchase a success."
4.0,"So far these have performed just fine!  I haven't tested them in the water yet, but when I tried to shake out my skinny wire frames they didn't budge, I have Salt brand prescription sunglasses, with very thin wires, the ear pieces are less than 3/8 of an inch."
4.0,"It is a beautiful bracelet but the yellow gold didn‚Äôt look good with my skin tone.  It is a delicate bracelet and could go with many outfits.  I choose one like it, but in the all silver tones.  I was impressed with the craftsmanship."
4.0,I should have purchased the XL. I purchased the 2XL and it is a little looser than I would like.
4.0,"A bit smaller then what I expected & was looking for. The stock pictures are slightly deceptive in regards to size. Read the product description; it's what I should've done but I was in a bit of a hurry.<br />I needed a work bag that could hold a few files without bending them & possibly a portfolio. I didn't want a masculine looking briefcase so I thought this was my answer. I was incorrect.<br />This does however, make a nice shoulder bag & it does hold quite a bit of everyday items. It looks higher end though doesn't smell it, regardless of the pouch they threw in.<br />It was extremely well packaged & was shipped promptly - couldn't have asked for better!<br />It's a great bag; it just simply is too small for what I intended to use it for."
4.0,"I bought two of these dresses after buying one of the quarter sleeve ones from the same brand. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 110lbs and ordered a small, the dress is about calf length on me. A little big on the chest and the shoulder are sort of puffy, but that adds to vintage flare. Lightweight material and love the pockets, but you do need to wear a slip because the material is see through. Overall, a great dress and I would buy again"
4.0,"The watch is quite attractive and the watch band is especially nice -- the band much nicer than those on most of these inexpensive Chinese watches. The face and case are not too big or small for me (some watches look bigger in their photos on Amazon than they really are, and the measurements are not always accurate, either). It also has nice heft without being particularly heavy. The only drawback is that it seems to need to be wound every day to keep working. I don't mind that because I have a watch collection and switch out watches regularly, but someone else might find it annoying."
4.0,Loved the design but on the small side.
4.0,"Gotta say, it looks great. The feel is also pretty good too, it doesn't feel cheap but definitely not pricey either. if they made one version without the double magnet I think it would be a real win but for the price this is a great buy"
4.0,"I really wanted to love this bathing suit however, it was too large on my chest. I am btw large C and D so I am by no means small chested. Very disappointed."
4.0,"Wayyyyy more comfortable than Nike shorts, definitely more room for your peaches in the built in mesh. With that being said, since this mesh isn‚Äôt putting your boys in a headlock I‚Äôve had a ball or two pop out if I‚Äôm stretching or running, wish wouldn‚Äôt happen in Nike shorts. But I can live with that since they feel a lot better in casual wear"
4.0,Shorts looks just like the picture I am between 125-128 height 4‚Äô11 I ordered a large shocking they fit perfectly it is no stretch In these short at all I do not have a large butt also my shorts did not come with the belt üò¢
4.0,Comfortable bra that gives good support.
4.0,Broke within a week. It says it's strong enough to hold a phone but didn't withstand real life use. They sent a replacement immediately
4.0,"Not a 5 because the chain gave me a reaction, it supposed to me a stainless steel product‚Ä¶."
4.0,It's very soft which I love
4.0,Love the costume! Only complaint I have is the arm holes were small. I had to cut open and re sew.
4.0,"The item was not quite what I was expecting.  Although I knew that the length of the necklace was 16 inches, not seeing the whole necklace in the picture, I assumed that the links of jade were going to be bigger.  I was expecting a little more substancial piece.  But, after I put the necklace on and wore it for awhile, I was rather surprised by how well the size matching of the jade to the legnth of the overall &quot;fit&quot; the necklace rather well, and it was weighted perfectly.  It was a comfortable piece to wear and I grew to love it more after actually wearing it.  A thing that I love that I don't think is mentioned is the clasp on the actual dragon is such that it can be removed from this necklace and put on other large necklaces. I have not tried moving it to a strand of pearls, but I would think that it might work!<br />I am giving it a four out of five because of that initial impression was not earth moving, but the piece is really quite nice.  If I wear it more and grow to love it more, I may regret not giving it a five!"
4.0,"The dress itself is beautiful and made in good quality material, however I found the fit to be a bit small around the chest area, and long if you‚Äôre under 5‚Äô6+. I sent it back for a bigger size, had it cut off and have been perfectly happy!"
4.0,Fits great! Love this shirt. It‚Äôs a must buy!
4.0,The shoes are very comfortable and soft..but not a real good arch support.
4.0,The dress is cute but there isn‚Äôt an actual slot for your leg to peel out of. It‚Äôs made of nice material but does feel a bit cheap. It fit me nice tho.
4.0,"This is a pretty pin under $20.00 that I bought for an &#34;under $20.00&#34; gift for a Christmas party.  It's not junky looking despite the very low price.  I bought it because I would have liked it for myself, so thought somebody else would really like it.  I was right."
4.0,"I'm an adult with an average sized head and these were a bit smug, was expecting something a little baggier but they're nice"
4.0,Snazzy socks I bought as a gift for my husband.  He loved them.
4.0,This was really cute. I'm 5'2 and 125lbs. The fit was almost perfect except the back is a bit lose. The elastic sew into the waist is very thin and doesn't hold well. I think if I sew the waist in a couple of inches it should fit much better.<br />The material is slightly rough but I plan on wearing this with a shirt under so I don't mind it.
4.0,"I wanted something snug so I ordered small and it is small/snug and for a petite person. I'm 5&#34;3' / 120lb. Colors are great and great price, too."
4.0,"I ordered this bag because you never know when you might need a clear bag on the spur of the moment. I live near a big city where there are multiple sporting and cultural events every single day! For many of these, a clear bag is the only acceptable type to carry in. I jumped at the chance to try this elegant-looking, well-designed bag. It is bigger than expected and its chain and strap allows it to be worn as a cross body. There is no way to adjust the strap, and it is awkward as a shoulder bag. There is no zipper at the top, which could be a drawback, especially in crowded venues. The bag comes with a zipper pouch in a charcoal shade which not only carries necessities neatly, but also makes the purse look less clear and more attractive. It is nicely made and the alligator trim definitely gives it the touch of class that many clear bags are missing. This bag comes with a nice knit protective case, which is a really thoughtful added touch. If it had an adjustable strap and a top zipper, I would gladly give it five stars."
4.0,"I like these aprons. They are not flimsy, although you do need to wash them a few times to soften them up first."
4.0,It's really pretty and just the right size.
4.0,"I meant to order a Medium because based on the sizing chart, a 36B should get a medium.  I could get into the small but it is too tight to wear a bra with so can only be used as a nightshirt.  So my wonderful husband went ahead and bought me the medium and that's a much better fit.  This is a really cute dress but note that it is a bit short and doesn't have a lot of stretch.  The coloring is great and I like the style.  I didn't give it 4 stars because of it not fitting because that was my fault, not the sellers.  I gave it 4 stars because a top or dress of this style really should have a fabrication with more stretch.  It just doesn't make sense for this cute dress that should be fun and comfy to wear to not have more stretch.  Otherwise I like it a lot."
4.0,I ordered the large and it definitely ran on the small side. I reordered up to XL and hopefully that will work. I gave it 4 stars bc it‚Äôs a nice weight fabric and the graphics were nicely saturated with color and also were of good quality
4.0,"Love the colors, love the style, love the &#34;flow&#34; ...however,  material is a little thinner than expected"
4.0,"Impressed! I like the pattern, fit is true to size. Only issue is I have a bit of static so it‚Äôs clinging. But still great for the price!"
4.0,Better than most products.
4.0,"Just slightly difficult to put through loops, other then that it‚Äôs a great"
4.0,"Update: I moved from 3 to 4 stars. It does seem to be well made and it is really cute. Still wish it had the double loop but it is a really sharp band!<br /><br />I'm not sure it's fair for me to rate this 3 stars because the seller did not claim there was more than one loop on the watch. (Typically, watches have two loops that hold the strap in place when you wear it. My experience is that a loop lasts a few months and then breaks. Since there is only only one loop, this means when the loop is gone, the band is done. (The picture clearly shows one loop - so seller isn't lying.)  Watch is very cute - I just know I won't be able to use it more than a few months."
4.0,"This is a nice watch.  Mine keeps functionally perfect time as received with only a routine morning winding.  The hour markings around the outer part of the face are clear and easy to read.  The overall design is simple and clean, the fit and finish are great, and the watch is surprisingly quiet.  My only reservation is that the exposed mechanism face causes the hand positions to be visually lost in the background clutter.  This is especially a problem at certain hour hand positions and in low light.  7:15 AM can be a particular nuisance.  This exposed mechanism design unfortunately seems to be shared with every other moderately priced mechanical watch on the market, for whatever reason.  If one wants a fully readable dial, one apparently has to go significantly upscale to get it, and the Mudder Classic is no worse than others in its price range in this regard.  A clean, simple full face dial would get it five stars."
4.0,"I would love to give these sunglasses 5-stars, but there are two issues I have with these glasses.  First is that they do seem flimsy.  I have only used them for driving so far.  I plan on using them for fishing in the summer.  I don't cycle much, so I doubt I'll wear them while cycling.  Based on how flimsy they feel, I wouldn't trust them while cycling.  They may be very durable, as advertised, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />My second issue is that the edge of the bottom of the lens constantly rubs against my face. It's really annoying. I'm always pushing them up higher on my nose.<br /><br />There are many good things about these glasses.  First, the case is awesome, but a little big.  Included in the package is a cleaning towel and a small carrying bag.  The lenses are easy to swap in and out. The myopia frame can be removed - not sure why it's included - but it if you don't want it, you can remove it. The glasses do make everything clearer.<br /><br />The price is not too bad for what you get.  I've paid close to the same for much lower quality sunglasses."
4.0,It runs a little small but it's still stretchy enough to fit. The criss cross strings were poorly sewn but for the price it wasn't terrible.
4.0,"Purchased for my 11 yr old granddaughter for church.  She wears a medium but it was too tight, so I ordered a large.  Cute and stylish"
4.0,Nice quality. Very comfortable.
4.0,"This jacket fit my 6 yo perfectly.  Even has a little room for layers underneath without being bulky.  She wore it during a lesson the other day, when it was 36 degrees outside, and it kept her warm.  The zippers are a little tough to get going but with some work they become easier to use.  Not sure how it would hold up to daily barn use, but for a weekly lesson I think it will be perfect."
4.0,"Super cute!  I read the reviews and ordered the XS/S for my regular size 8.  The dress is adorable and looks cute BUT the backside of the dress is super thin material; it is the material you would find on a costume.  The fabric kept riding up - I really needed double sided tape but was out of town for a party and didn't have it with me - bad planning on my part. Again, it is super thin so you need to wear something underneath.  And then when you wear something (a slip, spanx, etc) it is slippery and it rides up. I wore it to an office party and had to make sure I wasn't being in appropriate.<br /><br />Overall, super cute but make sure you plan ahead!  As it is, I don't really think you can wear it without something underneath,."
4.0,They were a little larger  Then I thought they would be But they work good.
4.0,"Satin texture, not cotton."
4.0,I read the reviews and they are not warm like I thought they would be. I live in NH and wear wool socks and my feet still were cold. They are not entirely waterproof either.
4.0,"For the price you just can't beat it.  I went with the Small.  I'm 5'5&#34; and bounce between 130 - 135 lbs with a 32 C.  The dress fits great, but getting it off posed a slight struggle.  It's not tight anywhere and I even have wiggle room for weight gain.  Not much, mind you, but there is a wee bit of room for growth.  The part that was tough to wiggle out of is when the waistline has to go over the bust.  That waist seam is sewn solidly and there's no give when removing the dress.  The old trick of moving it over the hips and stepping out of the dress instead isn't going to fly if your hips are wider than your bust.  I stick with my decision of Small, though.  Sucking in doesn't work, either, because that area of the chest doesn't get smaller.  I didn't want to bump up to a Medium and end up with material bunching or pooching, but it may have been a good idea.  If you are at 33 C I'm going to advise bumping to a Medium.<br /><br />I purchased [[ASIN:B01MRI3G4U Anni Coco Women's 1950s Hepburn Vintage Swing Dresses With Ribbon Belt Floral 7 Small]], which is a similar style in the waist, but with a zipper in the back.  That one was a little easier to take off, but this one has elastic instead so there's more material to wrestle with, and I struggled with getting the waist over the bust - a problem I don't often experience!  In fact, I think this is a first . . . .<br /><br />The waistline hits me at the base of my ribs.  I have a violin or pear shape.  I think I'm fairly evenly distributed with my legs being on the longer side so I was expecting the waistline to be closer to my hips.  It worked out because it leaves room to eat cake at the wedding and is comfortable to sit in.  :D<br /><br />The coral is pretty darn close to the image I saw on my screen.  I know everyone's calibration differs, but I can say that they didn't do some crazy off-the-wall unreasonable color change on the coral image.  It does lend more towards pink than orange in my opinion.<br /><br />The images are with a crinoline slip, but I might forgo that after I iron the dress.  I don't think the extra poof is necessary.  My daughters and mother said the socks were essential to the ensemble so I didn't crop them out of the picture.  Enjoy!"
4.0,Cute and comfortable but thin material. Definitely have to wear something over it unless going directly to bed.
4.0,Hard to put on/off
4.0,Love it. Wished I would have gotten a different color. It's pretty but I'm a pale red head so this color isn't the best for me. The fabric is nice and fits perfect!
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up from my normal size and they fit as expected.  They are quite comfortable and do not move when you do.
4.0,The pad slides on my shoulder a little and I've got broad shoulders also where it screws to the tripod insert gets in the way when i shot in portrait.<br />other then those two issues it works and looks great.
4.0,cannot adjust for larger heads
4.0,I was thankful I read the reviews before ordering. This shirt runs super small!!!! I am a medium most of the time. I read the reviews and decided to try and XL. I am glad that I did. If you are normally a small but busty--go with an XL. This shirt is very pretty. It is sheer so you need something underneath. I wore it for the first time today and have received many compliments on the cut/style and color.
4.0,Great for the price!  Very comfortable!
4.0,Its somewhat large
4.0,"This dress is so soft and comfy! I love wearing it with a pair of ankle or riding boots in the fall. The only thing that I don't like about it is it seems to wrinkle very easily.  When I washed it for the first time it wrinkled and then left very faint little wrinkle lines that were darker than the rest of the dress all over it. I was able to get them out when I cool ironed it but it was difficult to do since it's so stretchy. Overall, I am pleased and would order it again in other colors."
4.0,Size is a bit bigger then regular sizing
4.0,"Muy lindos, la calidad un poco pobre, pero para el precio estan muy bien."
4.0,"There is an error in this pentacle.  On the far right glyph, the one with the circle with the line inside of it - is supposed to be a + symbol with the lines going slightly outside.  The glyph is supposed to look like the symbol below it, but with the crosses lines extending OUTSIDE the circle instead of staying inside the circle.<br /><br />It still looks nice, i'm going to try to fix it myself.<br /><br />These pentacles are very ornate.  This is sort of skipping words on an evocation, it's going to alter the flow of energy.  I'll try to fix it with a dremel but i'm not sure if I can be that precise!"
4.0,Beautiful bracelets I love them and would buy more
4.0,is preaty but somewhat small if you are wide on the hips
4.0,Item arrived in a timely manner and fit as expected.
4.0,"Overall, fire. However, one size fits all is a bit annoying and misleading - the skirt itself fits fine but gawd DAMN is that elastic waistband TIGHT. Not tight in the good way, tight as in there is now new love handles ON TOP OF my already preexisting lovehandles. I‚Äôd say if your BMI is anywhere over 20, ya gonna get rolls hunny. For the record - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 132lbs. But like, just wear a semi-loose fitting shirt and you‚Äôll be good to go. Otherwise, high key witch vibes which was the goal. Everyone keeps asking me if i‚Äôm going to a funeral."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend and I got it in the regular size he usually wear but it was a bit big. Length was fine but the width was extreme.
4.0,"The picture quality isn't the best, but for this price, it's good enough. Aside from the picture, this shirt is loose and comfy and goes great with leggings, or is perfect for casual wear."
4.0,Nice pair of glasses for the price not afraid to throw them around .
4.0,Love it but I have only one issue... In the picture it appears longer than what it really is..
4.0,"Purchased for a trip to Cancun. Cute dress and perfect for beach. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù10, 36DD, medium build. Ordered a large and it fits great."
4.0,Su dise√±o
4.0,Sleeves do not look exactly like on the picture but its a nice shirt.
4.0,Nice top :)
4.0,Came as expected. Some bows were a little flimsy but none fell apart.
4.0,My daughter wore these on a trip to Grand Cayman. They served their purpose and held up nicely. I recommend using the size guide. I felt like I was sizing up but when I followed the guide the fit was perfect.
4.0,"Beautiful,gift"
4.0,Very cute! Love it...runs a little small
4.0,I loved the dress but it was too small.  Had to return it.  Thinking about ordering next size up.
4.0,The pants are very comfortable.  The pockets are decent sized and practical something often not found in these pants.  Not crazy about the ribbing on the sides - it sticks out a bit and while its probably supposed to be decorative I'd rather just have them stitched together.
4.0,"The lid is necessary to keep out the air and best utilize the anti-tarnish lining...I found the lid to fit nicely on the tray I purchased, the only critique I might offer is that the little tab used to lift the lid seems a bit flimsy and I'm hoping it doesn't rip over time."
4.0,"This pair of covers works fine when I walk in a stream. They are really waterproof, however they are still too short. Water can flow into the shoes from the front top side of the zip. I would suggest to buy longer shoes covers for stepping into water. For rainy day use, they are perfect."
4.0,"Material is great, graphics don't look cheap at all. However, it is very stretchy and clingy, pretty small for an xl around the middle"
4.0,"A cute casual dress that is easy to wear and care for, and fits true to size. Material is lightweight but not see-through. I'm editing my review to mention this dress fades when washed. I did wash it in a machine on gentle cold water as it does say hand wash. I feel washing by hand is a bit much to do for a dress. If buying a dark color do follow directions."
4.0,"It's a very well made jacket, just a tad small though for what I'd consider a true XXXL size. I ordered that instead of XXL as I wanted plenty of room under it for layering as I am a pretty solid XXL. Instead what I got fits like a snug XXL so while it is usable, it's not quite what I wanted."
4.0,"A bit narrower in the toe box than other Hoka One One's that I own. The cushioning is outstanding. I run with a forefoot strike and there is sufficient room in the toe to prevent my toes from banging into the front of the shoe, avoiding toenail trauma. However, the toe box is a little constricting after the feet start to swell a bit as the miles and time pass. I've had to compensate by not wearing thick, cushioned socks. The shoe, itself, has enough cushioning that the thick Cushees are unnecessary."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and comfortable, and the material is lovely. But unfortunately it looks to big on me."
4.0,"Like the look of it, don't like taking out links"
4.0,Very pretty...  it is as pictured.
4.0,"For the price, they are a decent quality. I'm pretty fair, and these were almost perfect for me. The only drawback for me though, the double flare (versus a saddle) is kind of annoying because the silicone almost has a sticky feel, making it slightly uncomfortable to get them in/out sometimes. All things considered, super satisfied."
4.0,My son loves these.  One broke when inserting them but otherwise very happy.
4.0,Material was soft and comfy.<br />Fit was right on.<br />Perfect pj's!<br />Update* not even a year after I bought them the top ripped in a couple place at the seams
4.0,This are a perfect fit for the Radar Path Glasses. The only reason for a 4 star is I wish they were darker in bright sunlight. Other tham that there awesome and are a better buy then Oakley lenses for the price hard to beat
4.0,My fianc√© is 5‚Äô6 and is 180 by there chart she should have gotten a large but it was to small. I am 5‚Äô1 and 160 fits me perfect. If I would to order this I should have ordered a medium. I kept the large for me and ordered her a larger size. Great shipping to by the way!!!
4.0,"My mother, who is 88, really likes this watch which I gave her for her birthday.  Since her sign is going, it helps her to hear the time and date.  Pretty watch and fits well."
4.0,So cute but my daughter need an x small for the top ... she‚Äôs 13
4.0,They do reduce headlight glare when driving at night
4.0,My wife loves it.  Price is far lower than comparable items in local jewelry store.
4.0,This is a great dress for summertime. It was just slightly too big for me. The pockets are a nice bonus.
4.0,"Liked the mask but had to work to get battery pack to work, but then it worked great"
4.0,The optical illusion was more impressive on line than in person. Still a good sweatshirt. GREAT material and weight!
4.0,The material wasn't as expected but the dress fit perfect. Loved it for the occasion
4.0,The swimsuit was exactly as expected. The tie on the back is perfect for an exact fit.
4.0,Great prop piece.  Solid design.  Actually pumps.  Not just a cheap piece of plastic.  Depends on basket whether it fits or not.
4.0,"Un poco peque√±o para m√≠ cara,pero buena calidad"
4.0,Great fabric and fit. Not great while working out. The shirt kept rolling up from the bottom.<br />Disappointed.
4.0,"Fits pretty well, other than being a tad bit tight around the arms. Even with a large, it still felt stuffy. I recommend buying one 2 sizes larger."
4.0,"With only 1 day of ownership it is a tough review to write. Initially, thought the display was dim and was ready to return it. However, at midnight the dial and hands came to life. The tritium is quite bright! A year or so will tell if this is an acceptable watch. In the past 4 years I have owned 3 Smith and Wesson tritium watches. They have all quit working for various reasons."
4.0,"These glasses were completely mirrored - my boyfriend can't see my eyes at all. The lenses are a little darker than I prefer, but they will be great for laying by the pool."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, great quality for the price. But I‚Äôm sending it back because it‚Äôs way too large for me. I ordered up a size because it indicates in the item description that the dress runs small and you should order a size up from what you normally wear. I noticed several other reviews mentioning they ordered a size up and were glad they had but this did not work out for me. I will be re-ordering in my regular size."
4.0,"Great glasses except my box only had 23, not 24"
4.0,They work okay
4.0,So far so good. But haven't realk ybhave a chance to truly test it out.<br />I've only used this in sprinkle days. But what I truly wanted was to use on hard pouring rain and windy weather but never had a chance yet.<br />Buy overall still a good product.
4.0,A little tight on the chest
4.0,"I bought these to sleep in and maybe run errands in. They're soft, except the tan colored shirt, that one is not as soft as the others. I don't find them to be all that figure flattering, but again I'm only going to sleep in them. They're great for the price!"
4.0,comfortable fit and good for travel as they dries quickly
4.0,"Really love the style and design of my Quay x Desi sunglasses, but my only concern is that they fit low on my nose. I'm sure it is just the style but they feel like they are going to fall off and I constantly have to push them up. So I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for that. Will purchase Quay again, but maybe in store where I can try before I buy."
4.0,These glasses are great for the price. I love the tint and fit but the plastic does feel cheap/fragile. I ordered these for my vacation because they were cheap but unfortunately they took about 4 days to ship out (with prime) and I did not receive them until I returned home from vacation.
4.0,These work well. Appear well made and after several weeks of wear I'm having no problems.
4.0,"Nicely made, love the color"
4.0,"Very cute! They are more of the thicker shiny fabric that doesnt breathe, so I couldn't wear them all afternoon. Was hoping for a softer cotton fabric.<br />But they are so cute and made well. I will wear them a lot.<br />Super fast shipping, perfect if you want to sweat a lot."
4.0,"This is a super cute shirt! But it fits small. I ordered it a size up because I wanted it to be a little big but it fit like my normal size. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great shirt!"
4.0,It is very nice shrug. It fits properly and color is exactly same as it described.
4.0,I wish it had a longer chain as it is more of a choker than a necklace
4.0,"The color is not purple at all but more of a rose color. The fit is extremely comfortable. I bought ten leggings from various brands and this one, by far, is my favorite. There is no compression with these, so they are the most ideal for yoga and, from what I can tell, underwear doesn't show through. You will see underwear lines, if that is a concern."
4.0,This makes a great Christmas gift!
4.0,"A friend has these with no issues, but many reviewers here are right. - these are small. And I am not that big a guy. Even at full extension, the cords are too tight on my ears. But they are well made.<br /><br />The stars come from just exemplary customer service. I will buy from the company again. But this model mask just did not work for me."
4.0,Pretty & well made!
4.0,"The quality of this jacket was impressive.  It's surprisingly heavy and keeps me warm.  The hood is massive, but I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.  I ordered the 3X (5'10, 280 lbs).  The arms fit comfortably but the body is too big.  I generally don't button it -- I just pull the belt tight.  I assume if I had sized down, the arms may have been too tight."
4.0,"when I opened the package I thought it was sized a little large but after washing and drying it the fit is just right, so you can expect a shrinkage factor.  the lining is warm and cozy and I received a compliment on the style."
4.0,"I just received my luggage set yesterday. I  would so love to have given 5 stars to this really nice 3 piece luggage set, but the color is so incredibly far off from what I was expecting that I had to really stretch to even give it 4 stars. The color is more like a bronze/copper color, but I ordered burgundy, which is a huge disappointment. I understand that there can be slight variations in color from what is seen in the photos but this color isn't even close. I added a photo that shows the color of the luggage in comparrison to what was shown it the photos in the ad.<br />So far, except for being the wrong color, the luggage it's self is very beautiful and seems well made. All 3 suitcases are very easy to maneuver. The caster wheels are great!! They glide smoothly across the floor and carpet with ease. Feels really great!!<br />The inside has 2 even sides, one with a zippered separation, the other has elastic straps with clips.<br /> I love the TSA approved locks, especially this design where the zipper pulls fit right into the lock.<br />  The TSA combination locks were very easy to set, lock, and release. Very Nice!!<br />Next month, my new suitcases will be travel-tested through airport baggage of several airports.<br />I will write an update to my review after I return from my travel experience.<br />Overall, this seems like a really nice set of luggage! I just wish it was burgundy!!"
4.0,Satisfactory and well made.
4.0,"Really long and smelled terrible, but absolutely adorable, just run it through the wash a couple of times."
4.0,"I received my monokini yesterday. First off, I'll give you my body type, to maybe help someone looking to purchase this: I am five feet, six and a half inches, 145 lbs, bra size: 34B, medium torso length. I ordered a Medium, size 8 and it fits like a glove.<br /><br />When I sit down, the fabric bunches up in the middle, but that should be expected. When I'm standing, the middle fabric fits great. My problem area is my love handles, so let me say: if you have love handles, a monokini cut like this may not be a great fit. It accentuates your sides and draws attention to them. I can deal with it, but just throwing that out there.<br /><br />The cups aren't heavily padded, but aren't flimsy either.  I don't think it's necessarily a push-up, but it works fine for me! The one thing I didn't notice before purchasing this is the bottoms- the cut goes does into the top of your crotch, so make sure you're shaven (if you want, I mean!) ]<br /><br />Overall, this is a unique swimsuit and I'm glad I bought it!"
4.0,"This is a really cute cape, and suprisingly good quality for the price.  What struck me most, and was a pleasant suprise, is that it looks like a high end Burberry piece of clothing in terms of its color and the pattern of the lining.  Very cute.  Gave only 4 stars because the fabric isn't the best quality - but still good."
4.0,I liked them a lot I just thought they were a little over priced for the product received. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd last long enough honestly
4.0,"Very cute fascinator.  Received lots of compliments at the Derby party.  However, the flower was glued on and eventually came off and had to be re-glued."
4.0,Love it.  Looks like a piece of jewelry
4.0,Beautiful tie. Vibrant colours. Unfortunately it arrived  damaged.  Will be returning it.  Will probably reordered this item in the hopes that I will receive one that is not damaged.
4.0,"My costume is a Gotham protester, so the mask looking right was a big factor. I read a lot of reviews for a lot of different Joker masks. They were not promising. I figured higher price point, higher quality and chose this mask.<br /><br />When the mask arrives in a soft shipping envelope I was a little concerned. When it came out of the packaging just a little bent and twisted I was happy the damage wasn't any worse, but I was still a little meh. But then I noticed the mask was latex, not plastic. A lot of the negative reviews were hitting that point hard... I'm a little less meh. Then I see the foam lining that goes across the top, from sideburn to sideburn. Plus, the length of the hair is 3.5-4 inches (didn't measure). The negative reviews were mentioning short hair. I'm digging it. I finally put the mask on and it feels good. Check it out in the mirror and no wrinkles or anything noticeable.<br /><br />From what I'm seeing this is the best priced, most authentic mask for the Joker face mask from the 2019 movie."
4.0,"Fits great!  I have huge breasts and top portion actually fits over them.  It's the little things like this that make my day.  Very long, I may need to hem 2 or 3 inches (I'm 5'4&#34;).  It's a stretchy cotton fabric.  Not slinky like other dresses I've had in this style.  Great for beach cover up or running around with a little cardigan.  if I could go braless, I'd wear it everywhere."
4.0,"Very good jacket, but the only bad thing is that it loses its essence after washing it several times ..."
4.0,Keeps sweat out of your eyes!
4.0,Husband loves the hat
4.0,Keeps tla person head very well
4.0,I do like these shorts. They do feel a little ‚Äúblousy‚Äù which I think it a result of super light weight material and the tailoring with elastic waist. But love the zippers and for gym shorts or backup swim trunks. Great guy for the price:
4.0,So pretty! The fabric is very good more than the Picture. But is to big for me üò•
4.0,It's a bit large and a bit thin and bendy but otherwise very cute
4.0,Love the fun colors but is snug around the hips and thighs
4.0,Wasn't expecting it to be so see through.
4.0,I would give it 5 stars but felt that the medium fit more like a large. Quality is nice. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äô and the sleeves actually are long enough for my arms. It‚Äôs just not very fitted on me.
4.0,Good buy....i like it!
4.0,It is good<br />Thank you
4.0,"These leggings are true to size, squat proof and a soft material but will probably end up pilling. Otherwise great legging for the price."
4.0,Beautiful. This was purchased as a gift. She loves it!!
4.0,you can lead a subject. and even do light to medium choking. but the neck ring will fail if you really put your back into choking and or dragging a stubborn subject.
4.0,Love these earrings!! Great for Christmas just wish the trees had more color.
4.0,"but they sent me 13, so the other 12 seem fine.  It's not the highest quality I've seen, but for the price it's certainly adequate.  I'm using it for my car keys."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:df8bb653332469e3a386fd531f4385e9]] They fit great as expected but are not cotton as most Kids Leggings are more of a silky material.
4.0,I'd prefer it on a standard hoop because this type slips off easily. But it's very pretty.
4.0,"the dress was very pretty - especially the lace top, but tho the dress itself fit comfortably, the top was about 2 sizes too small!  I was very disappointed.  However, the seller was understanding about my need to return the dress, and was prompt about refunding my money."
4.0,Nice size and color bag. Really like it!
4.0,"The fit is an expected. However, they are not high-waisted leggings and the sheen of the fabric is not as muted as I would prefer. Otherwise, decent workout legging especially for the price."
4.0,"Short for a longer torso so lower cut than I wanted. Thin material so its a bit see through as well, bought to wear as an under shirt so okay for my purpose."
4.0,"This watch is wonderful to look at. It came in a gift worthy box and as promised. I purchased this for my husband and while he loves the look of the watch, he doesn't care to wear it. It is very thick. I know this is popular with many watch brands, but the thickness is something that bothers my husband due to the type of activities he does each day. One star was removed for the thickness since that was not easily identified in the listing. Overall a great looking watch."
4.0,"Given the price, I was I impressed with the sunglasses I received. These sunglasses are a good spare to have around when you don‚Äôt want to worry about breaking them or scratching the lens. The little pouch included makes it easy to carry around. I liked that they were large enough to cover my entire eye area. I like to put sunglasses over my head to tackle any flyaway hair when needed and these pair hold up well. I also like the details around the sunglasses that make them seem a lot pricier than they really are. My only concern was the way the item was delivered. Amazon sent them in a flimsy envelope and I was surprised they were not damaged during transit"
4.0,Really like these earrings. They are a little bigger than I usually wear but still like them. Seem very sturdy and durable.
4.0,Beautifully made shoes. Way too small.<br />I recommend a full size up from your usual.
4.0,Super cute. Comfy the draw string waist makes it very flattering.
4.0,I ORDER EXTRA LARGE CUZ IM EXTRA LARGE.  BUT AM GOING TO KEEP IT AND CUT IT IN HALF ADD ELASTIC BAND AND MAKE INTO A MAXI SKIRT AND WEAR WITH A BLACK CORSET.  LOVE THE MATERIAL.
4.0,"Nice masks it was present for friend and they loved it)))) Material could be,more durable"
4.0,"Very nice jacket, especially at this price point. I am 5'9&#34; and 175lbs, and the Medium fit perfectly. My only complaint: There is no interior pocket."
4.0,"Very pretty, but too heavy for my ears.  Returned"
4.0,"These shoes are precious and you can‚Äôt beat them for the price. HOWEVER, they have a very slippery felt bottom that caused my 18 month old son to fall when he was in the house. But this problem can be resolved with a hot glue gun. (See my pics.) They are perfect now. üòä Also, they are about a whole size too big. I read that in the reviews so I bought him one size smaller and they fit perfectly."
4.0,Sturdy and large these are the ideal horns for anyone with longer hair as the thicker headband easily allows itself to be covered in a piled hairstyle.
4.0,"Great water shoes‚Äî true to size. The only issue if the Velcro gets attached to the main part of the shoe, it can damage it so make sure your child only attaches it to the strap area."
4.0,"I like that they were made out of a stretchy material so they actually looked fitted, rather than big and boxy. I expected them to come up a little higher on my arms, but they still worked well for my Roaring Twenties costume."
4.0,The texture of the fabric and feel of the bathing suit.  Great coverage overall where you need it.  Stylish to wear to the water.  Wish they had it in more colors.
4.0,"We have this dress is 8 or so patterns. We live in South Florida, and these dresses are very cool.  I took off a star because the arm holes are a little too large, but my kids are very slim so may not be a problem for others... so my kids wear tank tops under them. They wash well, the colors stay exactly the same, and they don't wrinkle."
4.0,"I love this robe, but I was very surprised when one of two loops which hold the belt just unraveled and came loose. An easy fix, but not a good sign for a *well-made* garment. I was also very surprised at the amount of lint which came off the robe. I ordered a black one, and there was black lint all over the place. It took two washings to get rid of it. Other than that, I love the robe. I recommend washing it a couple of times first."
4.0,"I bought these before, and I really like them. I also get these for my dad and he absolutely loves them!"
4.0,Suit is cute but the front does dip down pretty low especially for a 2 year old.
4.0,Liked the color. The length is good .it fits well just need to find the right top for it now
4.0,Runs big but pretty print
4.0,"Full disclosure I did not contact the seller so I do not know if they would work with me on my issue. I ordered 2. One's material is obviously thicker than the other, not a big deal. The description says ""Can Hugger"" but it is a very tight fit for cans. The thread on the top of one of the huggers started to unravel like the 2nd or 3rd time we used them and by now its like 1/4 the way down the side. They look awesome, they do keep your beer cold they just have some inconsistencies with manufacturing."
4.0,"Overall, these were cute but came with one set of the earrings that were broken. Not really worth the time to send it back. Still pretty good for the price since there were several others in this set that were good."
4.0,It's Okay!
4.0,I love the material it fit good to me. I suggest to change the design to be tube design i think its more summer looking casual outfir and have a detachable packet for padded foam.
4.0,Adorable.  My daughter gets lots of compliments.  They haven't broke so that's a plus.
4.0,The dress was super cute but maybe because I am short and on the ‚Äúheathy‚Äù side the proportions of the dress didn‚Äôt look good. I looked too heavy and my breast and waist seemed like intertwined-there was no definition between the two sections. But I really loved the design. Easy hassle free to return as well. Hopefully better luck next time.
4.0,Would have preferred a longer fit. It rides up a bit. Other than that it's great
4.0,I like them. Good fit. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 160 lbs and the large size fit well.
4.0,My hubby loves these pants. He bought them to wear while riding his Harley in the fal weather. Only reason we are giving it a 4 is because they are slightly snug.
4.0,Love the deep color
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and fits perfectly. Though I did order a size up. It is well put together. All the seems are finished properly and the zipper works without difficulty. The dress is also really floor length.<br /><br />However, the design is printed on one side of the fabric. When it snagged on a sharp edge, it made a white line all the way across this black dress. Also, the shipping takes about 3 or 4 weeks.<br /><br />By the end of it all, I am able to halfway decently repair the snag so it isn‚Äôt so evident and I am willing to buy (more carefully) from this brand again."
4.0,Love these statement earring. They are versatile and give a classy look to any situation. Because they are both gold and silver I‚Äôm comfortable wearing them with any other jewelry.
4.0,"Such a wonderful ring, but it runs big. I ordered a 10 for my husband's pinky finger, (which is really his size) and it just slips right off. It's disappointing because it's way too small to go on any other finger. I could wear it, but I'm a girly girl and it doesn't match my Celtic/Renaissance costumes."
4.0,"I love these bracelets but they are not great quality.  They are cheaply made, but for the price I wasn't expecting them to be Tiffany quality.  If you are looking for a great set of bangles that are under 30 bucks, then these are for you.  Just know that they will snag on knits and are not real silver.  I love them as a casual fun set of bracelets that look great on your arm."
4.0,This is my first pair of merino wool socks and I went with CloudLine after reading reviews on Amazon.  I haven't gone on a long hike but from the walking I have done they seem good.  Nice and soft and don't fall off my heel when I am walking which I absolutely hate.
4.0,Love the length and pockets! Fairly true to size. Arm are a bit small. Overall its a great tunic and I would order again!
4.0,Had to pin up the two sashes because it kept slipped off.
4.0,"These gloves are soft, warm, have a nice design and allow me to use my phone with them on.  Not a huge issue, but the finger lengths are a bit too long for me (I have small hands) and the tips aren't all evenly tapered (some fingertips are square, other's are pointy-ish). I wouldn't have a problem giving these as a gift."
4.0,"Fit snug in bust area, usually wear a size 18 plus."
4.0,Top was kinda big for me so I tied it .. bottom fits nice shows your curves .. got a lot of compliments especially for the color .. material is nice as well
4.0,Cozy and comfortable.  The material is soft and pleasant to wear.
4.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally do and it fit fine. The legs are a little tight.
4.0,Dress is really pretty a and coloful..i have the red one..i look like a candy striper!!! lol
4.0,"Love this for wearing to work, warm and comfortable, loose fit for sure. I only took one star bc I would have loved if it had some pockets. But im happy with it. I will add, im 5'0"" and it hits me at a good length so if you have a long torso I could see this running short on you."
4.0,"I really like this sweater but had a minor issue with it. The sweater is longer in the back then it is in the front & being so the slits on the sides are on the longer side in my opinion it made it lay like the back had wings which the picture clearly displays. I gave it a four star because I didn't like the way it layed in the back but I did shorten the length of the slits on the sides about an inch which did help the way it layed. The sweater itself is really nice, the material is super soft and stretchy. The sweater is defiantly oversized so I ordered a small when normally I would order a medium & it fit me just the way I like my sweaters which is bigger but not to big."
4.0,This hat is a good value.  I found the felt thick enough for the brim not to be floppy.<br />And the size is adjustable.  That‚Äôs critical for me as I usually wear a 6 7/8 size.<br />It‚Äôs a stylish hat and I would buy it again.
4.0,These are in U.K. Sizes! I thought they were in U.S but it turned out fine because you can cut them down if they are too big! I cut mine down and they fit and feel perfect!
4.0,"I am glad to find a thinner scarf for summer travel. Scarves are nice to brush the sweat off you temple during those long hikes up volcanoes or ancient steps. The added bonus is the scarf had a zippered pocket inside for valuables so your hands are free. The pocket is large enough to fit passports and an iPhone plus. The pocket is not the entire length of scarf. (More like a pocket you would find in your pants, but plenty big). It is sheer enough that it isn‚Äôt too hot but you can not see the items hidden in the pocket. The zipper is hidden but if you buy a dark scarf at certain angles you can see the white zipper track. Just tuck the pocket in towards the body. The material is a slight stretchy t-shirt flat not shiny  material. A good price."
4.0,Very nice quality and very easy to navigate through a busy airport!
4.0,"It's not for he-man wrists. It won't buckle around a wrist more than ~8&#34; around, so measure before ordering. It qualifies as 'unisex' aside from that, and as a kid's watch too. The watch itself is about 1.35 inches wide; it ain't big. Easy enough to read though. Setup is simple and the instructions are clear."
4.0,"It is very heavy/sturdy.  Great for home, not for traveling.<br />It is what I wanted.<br />It is hard for me at this time in my life to bend over.  This fits my need."
4.0,Queda suelto en la parte de los senos
4.0,really cute but runs small I gave it to my teenage daughter
4.0,Gift for granddaughter and she loved them.
4.0,"I can usually wear a size 6 in sandals, not in these!  After contacting the seller, they sent me a size 7. They fit but just barely. These are cute, but you need to size up!  I also cut one of the straps off the shoes as it was cutting into my pinky toe."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:78bdbda770bd59530f4fb70204261969]] we all know what it's like to press a button and have your umbrella open, but not many have tried to press a button and have your umbrella close. It really works and works well and it's small enough to fit in your glove box, bag or trunk. It can be hidden in your golf bag or it's even small enough to go everywhere you go without being obtrusive!  I opened it a bunch of times and it works every time. I don't use the cover because I find it cumbersome and flimsy."
4.0,This dress is as beautiful in person and it is online. I had to send it back though I went by the size chart and bought it to big. I will be ordering it in a smaller size.
4.0,Lovely sturdy locket.
4.0,"My daughter loves these! She gets tons of compliments! Two lights have went out though, after about a month and a few lights are not the same color as the rest. My daughter thinks it's because she got them wet?? Not too sure. But she still loves them!"
4.0,these are very comfortable .  they run larger then expected so take that into consideration
4.0,"Excelente para usar en d√≠as no tan fr√≠os.  es liviana, lo √∫nico malo es que por el tipo de tela del que est√° fabricado a la 2 o 3 lavada se rompe. Es muy frajil."
4.0,A little small and the hands sent exactly where they should be. But it is cute and i will be getting a size bigger.
4.0,This is not what I was expecting ... when i pull it out the package ... but when I tried it on it is actually a very nice fit . Nice in length. .. I got it in a medium because I didnt want it too tight for church . It has pockets which I love .
4.0,"great detail, looks beautiful."
4.0,"Hands down, one of my favorite rings to wear in my helix piercing. It's super cute and I get many compliments. I'm sad that I lost a ball so soon."
4.0,"A tiny bit small. I wear 38 jeans and grabbed an xl. Other than that though, materials real nice, pants real comfortable, look nice."
4.0,I love this sweatshirt it fits great and it flattering.
4.0,Very comfortable but a little snug around the waist. After washing these pants I noticed the elastic in the waist band was starting to twist. Overall though I love how comfortable they are - especially for traveling.
4.0,"Bought a small, I'm a small. True to size! Doesn't feel cheap! The straps on the top tend to fall off. üôÑüôÑ Looooooove The Pearl On zipper on The back!! üòçüòç"
4.0,"I thought it would be bigger so my loves it, its a small"
4.0,Worked great for my Carole Baskin costume for Halloween!!  I upped sized due to other reviews but I found out the inner shell which has a zipper was small and hard to zip all the way.  The shirt looks almost exactly like the one Carole Baskin wore but it is not shiny and reflective like the picture shows in the description.
4.0,"I wish they had a larger size I think they run small,but cute tees"
4.0,Very pretty. A bit difficult to put in.
4.0,Bought to replace broken watch for my son
4.0,A little tight around the ankle part other wise good fit
4.0,Just a little tight in the chest and I‚Äôm not a busty person
4.0,I think these are super cute! I already lost a flower on one of them though. It was just glued on so I'll have to glue it back. But I'm still satisfied with the product and look forward to seeing how my daughters pictures turn out with her wearing them.
4.0,Decal started peeling the first time I put it on.
4.0,needs pockets and plain color
4.0,"I have been working on minimizing my jewelry down to the few key items I really love and prefer to wear.  I bought these to be my Blue Set (I got the earrings and the neckless).  The earrings I received are a nice blue, similar to the ones shown on the sales page.  They a little heavy in that I can feel them when I turn my head; but they do not pull down on the lobe so no fear of creating a huge elongated hole in my ear lobe.<br /><br />The hook itself is sterling silver, so no swollen ear lobes for me!<br /><br />The only thing that I did not realize when making the purchase was that the blown glass is clear.  The coloring is added to the back.  This does give a nice effect and the black backing.  At first I thought the black backing was to help the coloring stand out.  But as I look closer it, it seems to be to the back side of the coloring.  I did scrape my fingernail along the edge of the black and I was able to scrape off a little coloring.  However, even though I am disappointed that these are not colored glass I still find them quite pleasing.  Knowing that the coloring is on the backside will keep me more mindful to take care of them.<br /><br />Overall, they are pretty, they are sterling silver and they have some weight to them to keep them in place, but it is not colored blown glass."
4.0,Love the bright colors & different than any hat I have seen. Will never buy from the buyer again because I got screwed on shipping.
4.0,Good quality ties that look and feel like 100% silk.  Great buy for the price.
4.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful & fits well. Quality of the material is also nice. I would have liked it more if the neck was bit more deep , it feels bit tight around the neck ."
4.0,I initially ordered a large but I have a D size chest and fat arms so I had to send it back. I ordered a larger size and that fit well.<br />It does have a STRONG factory turpentine odor. I left it sitting on a chair in for about 3 weeks for the smell to go away. That's why I gave it 1 less star.<br />But the stitching and quality looks great.
4.0,I really love how this looks on. The material is a bit heavier than expected but it moves well. The downside is that it's almost impossible to iron smooth again once you wash it. It's very wrinkly and takes a lot of work to get looking right again.
4.0,"I'm normally a small but ordered this in a medium based on the provided measurements. I should have stuck with my normal size because the medium is too big. I'd say these run true to size and to go with your regular size unless you want a looser fit. Quality seems to be good, just disappointed that the sizing chart was inaccurate."
4.0,Very thin...but beautiful:)
4.0,I like the length of this skirt and it is attractive. Only thing is the material is kind of thin and it is sized large. Go down one size for sure!
4.0,Need to be a little larger.  Have to stretch it out so it‚Äôs not so warm or tight around my neck.
4.0,Not very thick but looks very nice I like it alot on my boyfriend
4.0,Love the arch support and the adjustable strap.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but the waist is a tad restrictive if you are pulling it past an ample bottom :-)"
4.0,"Important note: The only part that is cotton, is the striped rim.  The rest is this cheap, thin plastic, similar to the type used for puffy jackets.  I did pull on the plastic quite a bit on the inside and on the top, and it does seem to be sturdy, it did not tear or change shape.  It does smell like plastic, it seemed to disappear after airing it out for a week.<br />So this is completely lined with black plastic and there's plastic on the top so this would probably be pretty good if you've got extremely wet weather and you wanted to keep your hair dry. I did find it strange that you can't wash it except hand washing it, you can't dry it  in nthe clothes dryer and you can't bleach it.  So I'm guessing the only way to clean it is by taking a wet cloth and wiping it down if you needed to or hand washing it and letting it dry for a week, hung up. I was able to wear my hair up in a big bun and still put this on comfortably. I think it looks cute on, depending on how you put the cotton rim.  This came with a face mask, that is super cute, maybe for a child or a teen girl when they are sick but need to get to the store?  I know that in China, face masks are a BIG deal, with pollution issues, so maybe this is a pollution mask?  I think it is cute.  The socks they sent as a gift as well, they are on the small size, will fit someone that wears shoe size 6 would be perfect.  All in all, I like the look if I had a black puffer jacket to wear with this hat, the shiny plastic look might be great.  I'm only giving this 4 stars, because it is WARM, and will keep the head DRY.  Great for wearing in powdery SNOW."
4.0,This dress is gorgeous but I bought it because it was listed as a petite. Already bought it in the regular. Vendor was a Fast shipper. & answered questions quickly for my return.
4.0,I am a nurse. It's perfect for what I wanted.  I wear it for work.
4.0,It is well made and I liked the color.
4.0,"Good quality leaf charms. Only negative is leaves are flat, not curved as would be in nature. I will use them in jewelry pieces I create."
4.0,"The box was small but intricate and pretty and the necklace was beautiful, but unfortunately a small piece of the necklace was broken"
4.0,"These jeans run small, but they do stretch a little, so order a size up."
4.0,"I really love this sweater. Very nice quality, but I had to return it because it runs small. I ordered an XL thinking it would be large enough if it shrunk but it was too small.  I was disappointed I had to return it and XL was the largest size the seller sold. I would have ordered a larger size.  I gave it a four star because it is a very nice sweater for the price."
4.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful!! But I‚Äôm really small, 4‚Äù11 and 115lbs and it‚Äôs so tight I can‚Äôt even zip<br />It. I ordered the extra small, guess I needed the medium. Great quality otherwise tho"
4.0,"I'm 5'7"" and 220 pounds. Ordered size XXL, fits ok. I like my tops loose and long. This one isn't as loose, long, or forgiving as I would like.  I'm shopping online more than ever now instead of in stores.  Reviews and pictures of others close to my shape and size really help me. I hope my reviews and pictures help other plus size ladies. I really hate going to the store and trying on clothes."
4.0,The color was true to the picture and it fits as expected
4.0,"I figure it‚Äôs probably my fault these got broken in less than an hour but I was super disappointed. My 2.5yr old looked cute in them, they fit great... then he threw a toy that landed on top of them and the temple arm snapped right off. Less than an hour. In his defense, he‚Äôs broken rubber ones somehow so I should have known better!"
4.0,I orded a small and it's cute but it's a little short and I'm a short person. The slip under it is a little snug. In 5&#34;4 and I have 32DD boob and a large ass. So I would go a size of two bigger if you are big in those areas. Works great for flat chested girls
4.0,Fabric feels great and fits my body perfectly.
4.0,This shirt is on the smaller side. It‚Äôs cropped and fitted thru the bodice and not see thru but the arms are puffy and sheer. The pattern is very pretty with a square neckline. Material is very delicate so not sure how it will hold up thru washing and wearing.
4.0,I bought a pink/gray bundle. The gray color one is very soft and light-weighted. I can wrap 3 rounds over my neck and feels good. The pink one is larger (wider). It is heavier and not as soft as the gray one. I can do only two rounds and it looks not as nice as the gray one.<br /><br />I give 4 stars because of the inconsistency between products
4.0,"I expected it to be too small based on the review and guess what, it was.  I am 5'8&#34; and 150 pounds,  It fit nicely if i wanted a long shirt but I didn't.  It is super cute and a good value."
4.0,FIT WAS ON THE LARGE SIZE WILL KNOW NEST TIME TO ORDER SMALL SIZE
4.0,This was nice until it broke.
4.0,"Light weight, and comfortable. Perfect for the beach or around the house."
4.0,Very small bottoms but super cute top
4.0,Cute but cheap looking.
4.0,"The purple warmers were perfect, exactly like the picture, good quality. The red ones on the other hand were nothing the the picture. They're more of a dark red."
4.0,Love the comfort and style.<br />Great protection.
4.0,"Very nice, good material, a little clingy but creates great curves!"
4.0,c√≥modos & good looking!
4.0,"The fit and cut was incredible. The only complaint I have was the smell. The shirt literally smelled like formaldehyde. I thought I might have to return it. I washed it twice and then finally soaked it for about twenty minutes in some Gain Fireworks, then washed... that did the trick. It really is a great shirt especially if you're large busted and don't want a shirt that announces it."
4.0,I really like this band. Color is super pretty. Wish it was sold in sizes
4.0,"My recommendation would be if you want a tighter fit, order regular size, otherwise order 1 size up.  The inseam is barely 5 inches.  But nice fabric."
4.0,"Very good quality, however, the bottom feels heavy. The collar was too high, makes your neck looks short."
4.0,"These are nice glasses that look like name brand glasses that cost a TON more. At this price not much to complain about, but wish they had the spring loaded (expanding sides). I've got a fat head and the frames that are double hinged help with eliminating pressure against the sides."
4.0,"I recently got into watches and went a little bit crazy at first (at least from my budget perspective) by hitting up panerai and breitling early.  I soon relized that while I loved these brands and watches, I needed one that I could wear to the pool or with shorts yet still look great in a suit and the TAG Aquaracer 300M met that requirment.<br /><br />I recommend for someone looking for a versatile but casual watch."
4.0,Extremely comfortable.  I haven't experienced as much wear as I saw pictures of but there may be a loose string here or there.  Overall I'd recommend if it seems like the majority of people aren't having issues.
4.0,Very nice fit.Have had my UGG slippers for about 5 years<br /> so they were getting a bit worn out and the new inserts brought them back to like new.
4.0,Good cheap ties. Often get compliments on some of the colours.<br /><br />Don't expect super good quality ties but they look decent enough for informal every day wear (I'm a school teacher and I wear them to work... But if I was a lawyer I wouldn't).
4.0,"This romper is really cute and feels like it's made pretty well, but the fit in the shorts part is just bad.  The crotch hangs so far down that it looks like you're sagging.  Not an attractive look at all.  Sending it back.  :("
4.0,"I'm usually a small, bought medium. Fits great! Love it!"
4.0,Size seems to run a bit small
4.0,I bought this dress for my toddler to pretend and play. Up to my expectation mark. Accessories are kind of okay as well for toddler. I am glad I didn‚Äôt pay much for few times toddler play.
4.0,Love this for my 13 yr old son. Gave it to him as a reminder of how amazing I think he is.
4.0,"great product ,was received as expected.  recommend"
4.0,I am sad to say this does not compare to the older versions of this wallet because of the quality of the leather.  I had to keep smelling the wallet to detect that unique &#34;leather smell&#34; along with checking the back for the &#34;genuine leather&#34; stamp.<br />  I found that the card slots were just fine and the more I use them ( :) )...... they stretch just a little.  However- when faced with never having this version again I will take it every time and continue to buy.
4.0,"I bought this for Halloween, I can't wait to use it with my costume."
4.0,"This works perfect,  I am getting fat and I have perfectly good work pants all broken in and comfortable.  This is allowing me to get more wears out of them and not have to go out and buy new ones"
4.0,This garment has plenty of room in the front and is high waisted. I like both of those features. The fabric seems a little too skimpy in the bottom area. I wear it to the pool. I just have to keep pulling down the backside crotch.
4.0,"Best watch of this type on the market for the price. The appearance and heft is remarkable, comparable to watches that cost 5 times as much (some from the same company, by the way). I have one I bought 4 years ago, it's been perfect. I bought this one as a backup in case I have to get the battery changed on the other. The world time function is a little cumbersome compared to getting the same info on line, but it works, and at 35,000 feet in the air it's very handy."
4.0,The legs were shorter than I thought they would be. The picture made them look longer to me. Other than that I love the way they fit.
4.0,Smaller than I thought- but a great deal for the price.  It was a gift to my young daughter
4.0,i ordered two we have twins they love the tu tu part the best . the straps were little loose for them but they are on the slim side for weight size.  i really liked them
4.0,This item is as it appears in the photo. The colors are what I was expecting and the texture was pleasing. I was glad to give this as a gift knowing it would be enjoyed and appreciated.
4.0,Exactly as expected.  I needed this to remember posture.
4.0,"A cute and beautiful bracelet. I have small wrists, the bracelet is too big for me.  Too bad."
4.0,"Super cute and what I was looking for, but it was too small! My wrists aren‚Äôt that big, and I went with the larger size, but it still squeezed really tight. I only wore it for about a week before taking it off."
4.0,"Fits a little snug at the sides when wearing socks. Otherwise, quite nice and comfy."
4.0,So cute and summery for cookouts
4.0,Changed color after the first use.
4.0,My step-son got this and wears it all the time (of course not to school)
4.0,"This is a very cute bracelet, but a little expensive for what you are getting, I purchase another bracelet from someone else off Amazon and the quality was as good or better for a WHOLE lot less"
4.0,Lightweight and breathable
4.0,Great watch band on my Samsung gear 2 looks great but no directions
4.0,"Got this band for my LG G Watch R... The band looks good and classy. I love the clasp design which makes the band look that good, in fact the main reason for me to purchase this. The leather quality is not the best, but pretty ok for the price."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little smaller than I thought, but very cute!"
4.0,"I love these pants, like the charcoal color and the fit and feel in general is good. Alas, they are at least 4 inches too long....but that's my fault for forgetting that at 5'2' I should have been searching petite sizes. They are nicely stretchy and should fit taller women beautifully. Maybe I can get one of my sewing friends to hem them for me, or failing that just chop them off since I only intend to wear them at home anyway."
4.0,Cute shirt. The heart on front of shirt seems to be off center. Always adjusting my shirt so heart is centered.
4.0,Super cute set. Material is very comfortable. Top is a bit shorter than expected but great fit.
4.0,"Beautiful colors and okay quality, but i'm not sure how much i will be wearing it and is it seems it will wrinkle everytime I wear it."
4.0,Looks very nice on my grandson. The only problem is they cannot be put in the dryer and the pants feel wet even when they are not.
4.0,the leather is nice quality with good brass buckles and rivits but the sword frog is assembled backwards on the belt their is no way to wear with the nice finish of the belt out and the laces for scabbard out i gave 4 stars because of quality of leather but dissappointed
4.0,"Stroll around baby bag: As a mom of four children, ages 2 months to 5 years, I've found this bag to be my favorite diaper bag out of the 4 I've owned.  I love the wipe-able interior material, 5 inside pockets for organizing, stroller straps, and its overall great size. I find the size is just right, not too small and not too big. I haven't owned it long but I expect it to hold up as well as other Vera products. The only negative makes this a four star bag rather than five: I wish there was a strap cover- like on the messenger baby bag- for more comfort and security on the shoulder: The straps tend to fall from the shoulder. If the straps were addressed, it would be a perfect diaper bag. I highly recommend this product and would purchase it again."
4.0,I ordered style three thinking it would have a gold buckle like in the picture...  turned out to be just another silver belt but its ogod quality at least
4.0,"Shirt is super cute and it is a good size. My son wears 2T in all his clothes and this fit him nicely. We were disappointed that there was a red line down the ""w"" of the word two (see photo). Unfortunately I need the shirt for my son this weekend so we don't have time to replace."
4.0,"Very good case, The textured sides are really useful for grip and it does't slide around very much. It's also pretty sturdy, the back is solid plastic and the sides are raised so that if you drop your phone the screen has some protection. My only problem is that over time the soft white plastic around the case get's really dirty, my is almost black now(Blue Mandala one)and while i've had it fr a few months it's still a huge drawback for me. Then again, i plan to order this case again soon so not much of a drawnack üòÇ"
4.0,"Fits and organizes clothes quite well.  Unfortunately, the mesh is easily torn.  Aside from that, great product."
4.0,"I ordered about 3 sizes larger than what I normally wear.  I usually wear a Large, but the 2XL fit perfectly!  I do like the top; just remember to size up!"
4.0,Bought this for my son.  Sweatshirt in Large fit more like a medium. Seller was contacted & responded quickly. Decided to order XXL & after washing it fits him great.
4.0,"I love sweaters but, this has quickly become my favorite. It's great for a little extra warmth. Right now it's in the 40's and I have thrown over a tank - and it keeps me toasty. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, wear XL shirts and I find it to be a perfect fit! The sweater drapes perfectly, and the symmetrical shape is flattery. I like the oversized look and is it not overly warm."
4.0,It was just too small for her will buy a bigger size really great quality
4.0,"Such a great dress.<br />Very long I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and it was a tad bit long, but wearing heels it was fine.<br />Many compliments how every-ever be careful with the zipper not the greatest quality"
4.0,i don't love the boat neck cut but I get a lot of compliments on the dragonfly and it's very comfy...plus covers my bum with leggings.
4.0,Comfortable socks for warm weather hiking.  Colors are a bit more garish than pictured.  But overall I like them.
4.0,"The design of the travel tie case is very good and I really like how well it packages the tie clips and tie. However, if there is 3 ties in the case, the case actually starts to bulge and is a bit hard to close. But the structure is very stiff and wont bend the tie and that is the most important thing. If it is just one or two ties, the case becomes very slim and can be slipped into the side of your carry on luggage. I got this product for a discount in exchange for an unbias review."
4.0,"I didn't even buy this watch. I found it in a mosh pit while  looking for my glasses...in 1996!!<br />I've had bigger, more expensive watches. ALL of them malfunctioned at some point, but not this guy.<br />Replaced the strap, changed the battery, it's still working and on my wrist."
4.0,"This vest is great! I got it as a gift and it‚Äôs really warm. I live in Chicago, so staying warm is important during the winter.<br />Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is that it runs really small. Order at least one size larger than normal."
4.0,Pay attention to the chart! In between size? Go up
4.0,"I wore this for my in-office Halloween day. It looks awesome walking around and taking pictures with folks. Sitting down the belt thing kind of rides up and there is nowhere to put my keys, wallet, or phone. Great costume, I suggest getting suspenders for holding the pants up. I was planning on wearing this to conventions but I may need to do some alterations to it first.<br /><br />I'm really torn between rating this a 4 or a 5 on this outfit. So, 4.5 I guess. It is exactly as expected. I'm 6'2 and around 280--this fit just fine. There are two belts, the cloth one, and the leather one. The cloth belt is a little tighter/shorter than the leather one. I thought the tabard pieces were attached but they are loose from the tunic (which isn't bad but it makes restroom visits an adventure). There are no pockets (which I expected but it is important to mention). The material is sort of like suit slacks--so it feels like wearing a marching band uniform. The sleeves and pants are long on me (I have no hands when the sleeves are rolled down).<br /><br />For the money, this is an incredible deal for an all-in-one &#34;Space Knight&#34; outfit. On Etsy, these are running for close to $200. I think I'll use mine as a base for making something more elaborate. As far as costumes go, this is pretty high quality. There are just some odd things about how it fits that drop it star for me."
4.0,I like the dress it it kind of long. I thought it would be a little shorter.
4.0,"These feel really great on, I just got them and don't know how they will hold up in wash, but so far so good..."
4.0,"Very cute, kind of thin, but very cool for summer. I prob will wear with leggings. Love the pattern!"
4.0,It is large on me but lovely
4.0,Very pretty. Lost a couple buttons first time I wore it. Found one of them and sewed all the remaining buttons on a bit stronger.
4.0,"These gloves run small, actually squeezes my palms, but the quality is very good.  I wear a size 7 glove, and ordered the large.  Although small (I'm hoping they will stretch a bit) I had no difficulty driving with them this morning so I will be able to use them.  I like the quality so much I might just order a second pair.  Although too tight across the palms (palms actually puckered) there is sufficient length for my long fingers and fingernails. My fingernails are not very long, but I have been know to pierce other gloves.  There is space left from tip of my fingers/fingernails in these gloves, just not enough width across palms, yet, they are reasonably comfortable - the leather itself soft and non-binding. I like them."
4.0,"Kind of small, looks nice. Delivery date as expected"
4.0,Flattering fit.  Good quality fabric.
4.0,Only reason for four instead of five stars is the fabric wrinkles really badly. Other than that it's very cute and pretty color!
4.0,Wear it for my daughters wedding. It was very beautiful.
4.0,My husband wears an L and the XL was way too small for him. Other than that it looks nice!
4.0,"Good product, good value, it sets pretty good with my watch"
4.0,"This are the cutest earrings. They go with almost anything, especially if you are into the boho style. They are sturdy and not heavy to wear."
4.0,"Nice belt that looks, and fits very adequately. It is a bit of a problem to make the holes, but if you are able to do it, you'll look amazing."
4.0,this was purchased for a family member and they loved it!
4.0,"I like this vest but it is pretty long on me (I'm 5'2""). That said, it is perfect for pairing with skirts and dresses. I bought this to go over a t-shirt dress that goes to just above my knees. It is a light-weight fabric with unfinished edges which makes it feel a little cheap but I am still happy with my purchase."
4.0,Loved the costume.
4.0,"This piece of jewelry came out exactly how it is in the picture, very rich and beautiful. I truly do not regret purchasing this set of jewelry."
4.0,Great watch. I really like it. Nice easy the read face. I bought it for camping because I can read it without my glasses! I couldn't give it 5 stars because they didn't mention the bright red/orange stripe in the middle of the band!
4.0,"This jacket in size large fit me well (5‚Äô 10‚Äù 170 lbs). The jacket is fairly bulky and and not a slim fit but I expected that. The weirdest thing about it is the American flag patch is a Velcro patch..,so I guess if you want to swap out any other patch you can?"
4.0,"When using it, I do not feel comfortable. It makes pressure on my nose which brings pain after some minutes. This is the only problem with this item."
4.0,"Very cute. Looks exactly like a Van‚Äôs shoe, just smaller"
4.0,Nice feel to the material for the price. Fits nicely and looks more expensive then it was.
4.0,I wear M US size but i bought a XL/L ( i don't recall now) and fits fine. I am 5'6&#34; so the top didn't have enough length so i gave it away to my friend. Apart from that i felt great about how the product looked and felt.
4.0,"I like the insert as it‚Äôs light and I can‚Äôt really feel it all that much when I wear it. It stays in place with the tiny notches on the side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-lightweight<br />-easy to use and stays<br />-keeps mask from getting into my mouth and nose (the main reason I bought it)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-causes MORE fogging than without it<br />-some are not manufactured well with melted parts of plastic<br />-not as flexible as stated<br />-collects condensation and gets kind of gross<br /><br />I‚Äôm testing cleaning them in the dishwasher to see if they can be cleaned that way. Will update later. These aren't meant to cover under your chin but just to sit under your lip on your chin area and over your nose. They will seem small to some if you have larger facial features.<br /><br />UPDATE: it goes through the dishwasher OK. This is first run. Hoping it will last as I continue to use them. I think I will give some of them away to friends. Second UPDATE: After a few runs, it is starting to deform a little (only run in top rack)"
4.0,It is an adorable piece. It is much larger than I expected but a very pretty costume piece. Very lightweight also.
4.0,"My husband loves these sunglasses for working outdoors and running.  They are very sporty looking and as long as you realize that going into the purchase, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  They are very light and stay in place well while he is running.  They are also polarized.  They are great for running, yard work, fishing, exercising, and water sports.  He wanted a pair that he could wear out and not have to worry about breaking them.  This pair fits that need perfectly.  They are not super heavy duty or fancy but that's not what we bought them for.  They do come with a cleaning cloth and a soft storage case.  They seem to be well made and I'm hoping that they will last a while.  I was able order this pair of sunglasses for a discounted price in return for fair and honest feedback.  I rely heavily on reviews when selecting new items and I am always fair and honest in mine.  I will update reviews if needed or if I have new information.  All thoughts and opinions are my own."
4.0,"These are very comfy, feeling almost like thick socks with a firm bottom that allow you to step outside for a moment. The memory foam provides a nice cushion without overheating your foot. I like how the bows are sewn on in such a way so that they will not untie and the color matches what is shown in the picture (I bought the purple ones). I bought them in a size smaller than usual and have no complaints as to the fit although I have small, wide feet."
4.0,Cute smaller hoops. I only liked 2 out of the 3 pairs. I did not like the pair with the flip close. The other pairs I really like and wear often.
4.0,Duper cute pant!. I was worried about how these would fit but they are fine. A little on the short side but I don't normally notice. I am 5'8&#34; 150lbs. I wear these to work out and just for lounging around the house.
4.0,Size small was too tight - I'm a size 4/6 women.
4.0,"Great looking, high quality strap. Digital camo looks great. Measure your wrist before purchasing. I didn‚Äôt and I have the watch buckled through the very last hole. I guess I have a large wrist, amongst other things.<br /><br />EDIT: Please note I ordered a 20mm watch band for my Casio Royal AE1200 with 18mm lugs and modified the band to fit."
4.0,"Super cute and flattering! The strap snapped the first day, and the under skirt fabric is VERY tight on your legs. The fabric looks different in pictures than in person. Overall, very cute and will be wearing many times- once I fix the strap:)"
4.0,My one year old used it a handful of times and the seam at the toes is faded and cloth is coming apart.
4.0,"Comfortable, but in places, the lens is not as clear as I'd like."
4.0,"Hasn‚Äôt been gifted yet, however, I‚Äôm sure the recipient will like them."
4.0,Really cute but way too small. Ordered larger than I normally wear and couldn't get past me knees.
4.0,I like it. Didn‚Äôt say love only because since it‚Äôs magnetic it hasn‚Äôt to be adjusted one than once.
4.0,"Very pretty, a little see through"
4.0,"The colors and the way it fit watch connection. Just which the band came a little larger, had use almost the hole for right fit."
4.0,The color was right
4.0,"I have gotten a lot of compliments from people when I wear the glasses. They are a little cheaply made, but you CM can‚Äôt beat the price."
4.0,"Super cute and such an affordable price. The quality is so so. The top part feels really nice and is super cute. The skirt part feels a little cheap, but its nice enough for the toddler I got this for to wear all the time. We dont have to worry about her getting it dirty or spilling something on it. She can look super cute and stylish for such an affordable price. I want to get this for her in every pattern!"
4.0,They come to just above the elbow. They are smooth and look good on. They keep my arms and hands warm.
4.0,Nice pjs. Good color. Grandaughter 2t but got 3t. Will fit but to last longer should have got 4t
4.0,"I love the fabric and look of this suit, it's genuinely replaced all my others as my favorite. I bought it so I would have a suit on a girl's trip, as I had forgotten one and needed something quick. It's really flattering on my smaller chest and broader shoulders, something that I really didn't expect with the caged front.<br /><br />That said, it's really, really short in the length of the suit. I don't know that I could have sized up exactly, but as a tall girl, it's tight enough to be a little uncomfortable. I'm hoping it will loosen over time and won't not wear it because of this issue."
4.0,"Great for staying comfy at home, especially during the winter and against cold wooden/marble floor. It's pretty nice, however, nothing indicates that it is an officially licensed Sanrio product."
4.0,I love the t-shirts for my grandkids and they did to. My only complaint for the price is that the cotton material was not a heavy/thick as I would have expected.
4.0,very fun!!!
4.0,Pretty and good for the price.
4.0,Quality item. Works good. Only problem is it slips up my head while I sleep
4.0,It was nice and comfortable but length was long for me so had to return
4.0,Nice piece- great design inscription was a little small.  Chain was decent.  Shipping was excellent.
4.0,"These are very nice, the coloring does vary a bit from what is displayed and what you get but over all still nice! And the packaging.... very nice!"
4.0,The material in this dress was heavier than I expected but I like the way it fits. I really wanted one in red but since they didn't have it in my size the green will do.
4.0,Was a gift - was well loved
4.0,The hand bags are made from quality material my only disappointment is that the biggest is a bit on the small side
4.0,Loook nice and are sturdy.
4.0,"Love the looks of the watch. Very stylish and sporty. I would have given it a 5 star rating except for band breaking within a month of purchase. Currently dealing with company to solve concern. So far, they have been quick to respond and hopefully all will be solved quickly."
4.0,Beautiful watch I bought for my mom for her birthday. She loved it! Taking away a star only because it was difficult to figure out how the latch worked. One we did it was easy but look a while.
4.0,Kids love for nerf battles
4.0,"A very pretty shirt but a few &#34;buyer beware&#34; points:  Like a few others I've seen and also purchased lately coming from China, the &#34;brushed&#34; cotton feels a bit scratchy.  I haven't washed it so that could change things, but I kind of doubt it.  Also, as with several other all cotton shirts I've purchased lately like this, very Chinese labels, for example, the directions are to either dry clean (argh!) or hand wash (hmmm).  I am willing to hand wash because I really want cotton blouses rather than the synthetics that seem to have taken over the marketplace.  Then there is the size.  Normally I wear a medium.  For this shirt to fit I had to return the XL (extra large!) and get the XXL!!  Hopefully it will not shrink much in the cold water.  The print is simple, but lively and fun.  The size, even though right, leaves the sides a bit on the baggy side."
4.0,"The instructions that came with the remotes are not complete.  The instructions in the LiftMaster video are not complete.  To program these remotes for a LiftMaster opener you have to combine both sets of instructions:<br />START THE PROGRAMMING PROCESS WITH THE GARAGE DOOR CLOSED.<br />1. Push the Learn button on the back of the opener itself so the LED light on the opener comes on.<br />2. Push the button on the back of the remote so the LED light on the front of the remote comes on.<br />3. Press and release the button that you would like to program 3 times, the light on the opener will flash on.<br />4. Press one of the other buttons to finish the programming process.<br />5. Use the remote to open the garage door."
4.0,Fit the foot and toes well. Still need to try yoga with them. Maybe a five star after I use them for yoga.
4.0,Came on time. Color a little different than the image online. Size based on waist and hips so measure correctly. I measured twice and they fit perfectly.
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars but to a long time to receive....other than that it is a great buy!!!!  Highly recommend it!!!
4.0,It‚Äôs a great nightgown not too tight (got xl I‚Äôm a 16). It is a comfortable rayon fabric and breathable.
4.0,Grand daughter
4.0,"The nose is very low quality and will probably fall off fast. The antlers are perfection though. The kids loved to see it on the car. I'm not expecting the nose to survive, it is cheaply made and doesn't have a good way to attach it. The antlers are better quality and stay perfectly on the window!"
4.0,"The backings were crooked when they arrived, probably from the travel oversea, but they easily bent back into place. The earrings themselves are very cute and pretty! I love them."
4.0,"Very pretty.  I have  several nice pieces of fine jewelry, but hesitate buying expensive earrings because I lose them too often.  These are convincing knock-offs.  Like 'em a lot."
4.0,I am 140 pounds and 5feet 6 inches. Dress looked and fit better than I thought it would and arrived much earlier than expected. I am pleased with this purchase.
4.0,fits well and i love the way it flows
4.0,Good to accessorise your outfit if you need to transform your office attire into evening attire. Keep this in your purse just in case you need it. It looks quite impressive for the price.
4.0,"I bought these slightly large to accommodate cushiony inserts, and I love them. They brighten everyone's day so much during rainy dreary weather! Seriously, I receive compilments everywhere I go in these babies. Don't fool yourself into thinking they were intended for all-day wear, though. You will get sweaty and gross (they're waterproof; stupid me for trying) so bring another pair of shoes for the office."
4.0,"I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews, but I‚Äôm pretty surprised at the quality. They were as ‚Äúcheap‚Äù as  thought they were going to be. They are definitely high wasted which is fine i like them that way and they are a bit snug but over all pretty good they only complaint i have is that the bottom ‚Äúhole‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a hole. It was never cut."
4.0,"I would like to start by saying how much I love them. They are super pretty and I like the wooden look, but the flare is HUGE.<br /><br />I've been at a 0g for at least a month now, if not longer, and I still can't fit them in my ear. I'm actually kind of afraid to because I do not want to blow my ear out or something trying to push it in. I even tried tilting it to put one edge in before the rest sort of like a steering wheel cover, but I still could not get it. They would be PERFECT if the manufacturer could just sand down the back flare a little bit or something."
4.0,"I do like it, I just thought it was going to be a little bit longer. Definitely more of a tank top rather than a cover up."
4.0,"One of the bows fell off the first day my 3 year old wore them but I do like the shoes, super cute."
4.0,"It's very light and a little see through, the lighter color at least. The material is thin but it looks nice. You get what you pay for."
4.0,Fits as I expected it to.  Not too tight that its uncomfortable.
4.0,"I am wishing I had bought a bamboo version of the cone hat - even if it means I had only gotten one of them for $20 or more. These hats are made of straw and will be more inclined to break if someone were to accidentally step on it. The ribbons do not make them look any more ""cheerful"". I took them out and replaced them with cheap silver wire ($3 or more) that I bought from a jewelry store. Silver wire will definitely help keep cone hats on your head much better than the ribbons that were attached ever will. So I modified the hat so that it stays on my head way better... and it won't blow away if the winds pick up in speed because the wires I installed are pulling up and not horizontally like the ribbons do. These cone hats give your head and neck great coverage from the sun.<br /><br />As the hats are I give them a 3/5. My modified cone hat, I give a 4.5/5.<br /><br />UPDATE: This same exact hat can be bought at Halloween Express if you have one close to you. This October anyway. I don't know if they will be available after their initial sell out."
4.0,"I like these.  Much more comfortable and gives a pretty look instead of a hospital look.  The only drawback is a little pucker on the sides, that leaves a little non-flat contour/small opening on sides.  I will try to adjust to make flatter!"
4.0,Love it!  Will definitely purchase additional sets.  Wearing them makes you feel like you are wrapped in a cloud.  Very soft and warm.  Size seems to run a bit large.  I ordered 1X and could have been okay with Large.  Product did not shrink when washed.
4.0,"I like the pocket book, a little bigger then I expected, but has come in handy regardless.  The straps are a little annoying as it's hard to keep the length how I want because the slot keeps moving, but other then that, really good for someone who has a lot of stuff, there's quite a few compartments to store stuff in, side pocket holds my phone and cigarettes."
4.0,Slow shipping but these worked great for a tie-dye shoe project we did with sharpies. And you can't beat the price!
4.0,"I really like these shoes. They are cute and will go with almost anything my daughter will wear this summer. They do run large. If I had known how large they were, I would have ordered a smaller size. I also do not like that as soon as I took them out of the package and inspected them, the insert that is glued down is already coming up so they are not the best quality but these were relatively cheap so we will just add more glue and hope these make it for the year."
4.0,"Love my bag, strong bag"
4.0,A little larger than I expected but otherwise quality good and  fashionably
4.0,"The design is pretty, but I thought the short was a little bit longer."
4.0,"Let‚Äôs start a with the good and why it rates 4 stars:<br />- design is nice (pattern and colors all work well together)<br />- quality is good no loose thread and such. Though it gets the normal fuzzy of thick blankets and scarfs<br />- looks good on.<br /><br />Neutral/notes:<br />- larger than normal<br />- it is a lighter scarf, more for fall/spring than winter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- there was a distinct weird smell that took months to wear off. Like 3-4 months. This makes me a little hesitant to recommend without issue.<br /><br />Basically if you are sensitive to weird chemical smells, probably stay away from this. Otherwise you will enjoy this but will have to wash it a few times to get rid of the smell"
4.0,Great for keychains and hanging things etc.
4.0,"Fit as expected- though I wouldn't call this &#34;long&#34;, it's actually just past the top of the hip but not quite mid-hip. It won't creep up and you don't have to worry that it will crawl up when bending or sitting. The armholes are large and show more than the v-neck and the sheer material guarantees you'll want to wear a tank or cami underneath."
4.0,Tight fitting on arms... that is unless you have pencil thin arms. It‚Äôs snug at the shoulders and just slightly along the chest area. Otherwise it drapes nicely.
4.0,"These look super cute, and stay put, but they are so tight. I could only wear them for about two hours. My ears were bright red. I can‚Äôt imagine this on my nose!"
4.0,"The jumpsuit was comfortable and very cute. It just was a little too cheap of material for my liking, very thin. It was very long though, if you can tell from my pictures I was wearing heels and it still had extra room. I ended up returning the jumpsuit because I was expecting a better material for the specific event, but it is very comfortable if you needed something simple."
4.0,"The dress seemed larger than the regular size. I got an XL . Also,  felt the color was slightly duller than what is shown in picture."
4.0,Awesome color. Would be better with more cotton
4.0,I ordered 1 size up. Too tight for comfort. Will go up and reorder because the material is light and soft
4.0,didn't have the pattern in the photos
4.0,Not bad. My sister loves them. They feel like they can break if they to a hard fall or a good twist.
4.0,The suit was so cute until I put it on and it wouldn't cover by chest. A friend loved it but she had the same issue. If they made long torso suits we would definately purchase!!
4.0,"Fits well, though it would be thicker."
4.0,I love this belt.  It arrived with a few dirt marks on both the outside and inside of the belt.  Hoping I can get them off because I really do love it.
4.0,"Es bonito, es talla grande! Yo soy L y me quedo grande, as√≠ que recomiendo comprar una talla menos!"
4.0,"They are really beautiful and very comfortable, but the ring that holds the butterfly on to the earring. Wasn't closed all the way and the butterfly came off. I had to use pliers to fix it."
4.0,"the glasses are really small, and are cute, but not on me lol. the glasses are hippie and look like the hippie, mitch from friday the 13th the game. they are really good too."
4.0,I really like this clutch. It is very roomy and small. I use it like a wallet in my tote but it‚Äôs big enough to fit some extras when I use it alone. I only wish there was one other divider in the bill holder. The only problem I had was the strap broke after a few uses. I did order a chain strap as a substitute.
4.0,Very cute hard to bend but love this
4.0,Fit too loose.
4.0,Great for the price! I paid $7 total so I'm happy with them.
4.0,"Not sure how well this rain gear is working for my son as he is on a camping trip right now. I had seen the Toggs in the store and in just looking at the large, I thought it would be too big for him (slim 12). After reading the comments I went on an ordered a medium. I think the medium is fine for warmer weather when his clothes don't need to be layered, but right now I'm wishing I would have ordered a large so that he could put the Toggs on over his jeans, shirts, and even a coat. It's quite nippy outside and they will be canoeing all day. The jacket is large enough to put on a few shirts underneath but the pants seemed just right (with a pair of polyester shorts underneath)."
4.0,Love it. great product.
4.0,"I like this shirt, but it shrunk a bit. I'd order a size up otherwise great!"
4.0,"Super cute! Great fit! But was misleading with color. I thought they were red but I received orange. Not too big of a deal though, turned out cute."
4.0,"I love the color and how these joggers fit on me, but they're not very breathable and don't dry fast when I wore them to work out. I think it's because they're made of nylon, but polyester."
4.0,Haven't swam in it yet but it fits perfectly!! Super cute!! Nice that it has a padded 'bra' in it!
4.0,it does what it is suppose to do and its nice for the price
4.0,Beautiful earrings but bigger in size than it is on the picture.
4.0,"This woman's side slit dress/shirt is very cute! The perfect thing to wear with a nice pair of leggings, and a cute pair of flats. The material is stretchy, and also has a lightweight, airy feel to it. For me personally, because I'm not a dress person typically, I would will only be wearing this with leggings under. However this would make a super cute dress without. The side slits to do up a little far though.<br />I ordered a size large, which is what I normally wear, but this is just a little too tight for my taste. I would suggest going up a size.<br />The dress is made very well. The material is perfect. And all the stitching is done perfectly. No holes, frays, or torn stitching. Overall a great item, my only suggestion is ordering a size larger.<br /><br />I recieved this item for free in exchange for my honest, and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"Let me start by saying I adore(d) this luggage set, which is why it's even more of a disappointment that the bag I checked on my flight is practically anialated. This happened despite using a well rated heavy duty PVC luggage protector as well. I'm sad I wasted my time and my money on this but mostly that I got my hopes up.<br /><br />If you're still considering checking this bag for some reason make sure you purchase TSA approved locks as the built-in ones apparently are not.<br /><br />My carry on got moderately scuffed from the overhead bins but nothing terrible. The color on these is beautiful but apparently not durable enough to fully withstand air travel.<br /><br />*Update*<br /><br />This company's customer service is fantastic. They are very quick to respond and helpful in resolving issues. Between that and the fact this  is five star luggage if it just held up better I'm increasing to all of 4 stars. I hope they can make this more durable in the future, I would happily pay more to have a beautiful set of luggage like this that could survive air travel."
4.0,I just prefer small than showing them so thats just how i like them but they are tiny. They Seemed great at first but they shrink more after each wash.
4.0,"Product is more like a thick panty hose, I still ad to wear a bra to have coverage and support. Overall a good product"
4.0,"Wallet‚Äîdoes what it‚Äôs suppose to do, holds money and if. I like the color and design. The zipper‚Äôs a little janky. It gets stuck and is difficult to zip."
4.0,"Jacket fits perfectly on my daughter, she loves it."
4.0,I recommend sizing up.
4.0,"These pants are amazing for lounging around during hot summer months. However, they are very long...which is awesome if you're tall, but I'm 5'5""! I had to take them to get hemmed. Now that the length's right, I use them all summer long."
4.0,"Would be nice to come in split sizes, bottom needed to be small, but now chest is way to small, otherwise it is good"
4.0,Run big but great for price
4.0,It was exactly what I wanted. Just as it was described!
4.0,Cute but white is see thru!
4.0,"these are ok to wear when I'm not doing anything, but they seem to hold the damp easily and are a bit bulky."
4.0,"Thought material would be much thicker. However, it's comfy."
4.0,I have these in a few colors now and always get compliments. Fun!
4.0,Cute! A little hard to get on and off but other than that not a single complaint!
4.0,it seems to fit ok .had to cut neck piece because it was way to tight around neck
4.0,"I am quite a short girl so length wise, this does not work for me. I need to get it hemmed for it to work on me. Luckily, the top is adjustable so I can make it work.<br /><br />This would be good during the winter to wear underneath a loose sweater or so. Often times I find myself wearing an undershirt and tights so this makes it simpler. I do feel that the fit is very similar to tights.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Really cute! Material is pretty thin and a little see-through in the right lighting. But could be paired with a set of leggings as it is a tunic length.
4.0,The size chart is correct. The fitting of the dress was beautiful. Be mindful of what you wear underneath the dress.
4.0,I like this. The material is kinda fleecy and clings bad. Plus the sleeves are tight at the wrist. But overall I like it
4.0,"Super cute floral design, must admit the inside is a tad bit tight so space is reduced and limited. With that being said, this bag is small but cute! Color isn't exactly as pictured either, it's way more pink than the vague purple I was expecting. Appears authentic."
4.0,I‚Äôve been looking for these headbands for a while. In store they‚Äôre usually this price for one so this is major bang for your buck. They can also be worn on the reverse side for a slightly different pattern.( Well the twin on the left  in my picture). These are my go to for bad hair days
4.0,"Decent product for the price.  I had read many reviews re sizing, etc.  I wear size 8 and they fit well.  Not as nice as my old Totes, but I can't find Totes any more."
4.0,It's a really rad hat. It's got a lot of extra space on the top of the cap between my head & the cap - but that's the style I suppose. The colors are great! It's nothing to write home about but I have worn this hat a few times and I like it!
4.0,Fits great (I‚Äôm 34D and fits as expected). It‚Äôs not horribly comfortable but it is strapless and that‚Äôs so hard to find.
4.0,"Solid watch.  Slightly heavy, but that does add to the feeling of quality. I feel like the pin will break long before the watch.  Glad I got the lumi face."
4.0,wish it had split sides
4.0,Like  warmth  n
4.0,Nice. As described.
4.0,"I'm 5' 6"" and ordered this shirt in a small.  I feel like it's a little baggy, but I can work with that.  I love the detail at the end of the sleeves, but the white shirt is a little see through and the V neck is a little low for me.  It also falls off my shoulders.  The moral of this story is I should have ordered an xsmall.  I'll have to add a cami underneath, so I will be keeping this."
4.0,Not as fitted as I like but it's still cute.
4.0,"Fit well, great quality. I really love these!"
4.0,"This is great! I wear it all the time. I just had to squeeze all of the clasps together because they kept getting snagged and coming undone. After that, no problems :)"
4.0,it looks great with leggings and high heals.  I love the color.
4.0,"I had a similar set and forgot it was in the window.  I rolled down the window to thank a driver for letting me merge into traffic and one antler blew away.  I had to buy these to replace it. This set seems pretty identical and the first set did have a seem tear that I sewed together, so they aren't going to last forever in the elements but should hang on for a few seasons since it is only a month or so of exposure.  The bells will rust and the ribbons might fly off but it is fun and festive to have on your car for the holidays.  I got this set on sale so the value was great but not sure I would purchase at full price since the wind and weather wear the material down."
4.0,"It arrives sooner that expected (ordered on 8/7 ARRIVED ON 8/10 WAS SUPPORTED to arrive on 8/14, I thought it would be a little more wider that what it actually is. However all in all it's a well crafted belt"
4.0,"I LOVE the shoes!  Be sure to charge them for 3 hours  first. The only criticism I would have is that the remote control did not come with any instruction.  It  would not respond to the sole of the shoe.  I changed the battery and discovered that the  battery insert was backwards.  When everything was in order  it worked!  The shoes arrived very quickly and were packaged in two mailing bags.  I expected a box, but the bags were fine.  I would buy again."
4.0,It looks very cute on but I wish the material was thicker
4.0,Cute and comfortable . Fit as listed .
4.0,It runs small but I read prior reviews and bought 1 size bigger. It fits fine and was worth the purchase
4.0,this dress runs small.
4.0,Very pretty! Doesn't look cheap and fits plus size.
4.0,"If there was a 4.5 star rating that is where I would have put these.  The face mask part is well molded to the face and only allows the smallest amount of light to leak in.  The mask part itself is very comfortable and does not place and pressure on the eyes, rather cupping them, which allows you to blink or open your eyes while wearing the mask if you need to.  The temperature is comfortable and they do not seem to trap in heat.  My only issue with these masks are the straps.  While they are easy to adjust and should be comfortable, it is the placement that bothers me while wearing them.  If I wear them above my ears like glasses they cut into the skin making them uncomfortable, so I have to wear them over the ears and make them slightly tighter than I would like for complete comfort.  Overall I think they are a good value for the price and would reccomend trying them, noting the 2 caveats I listed.<br /><br />Reviewer's note: I received this product at a discounted price in order to provide my honest opinion of this product in regards to my experience with it. I make no guarantees that your experience with any product I review, whether I have paid full or discounted prices for will be to your liking or not. This is just one man's opinion. I have no affiliation, vested interests, nor am in any way a stakeholder with the company"
4.0,Feels good against my skin. They are thin but not too thin. I have wide hips and a big butt and they fit perfectly. They don't dig into my cheeks and create deep panty lines. They do ride up a bit sometimes and they do fall down under my belly roll occasionally due but I still like them.
4.0,Lightweight‚Äã and lots of space. Thanks.
4.0,"Material is a little cheap but you get what you pay for! All in all, cute little purse for going out or to wear for a short period."
4.0,The tops fit just right but the shorts are booty shorts. Big hassle to return
4.0,Insoles don't last too long.
4.0,"The overall suite is gorgeous, 4 stars only because if you are a taller female like myself this suit is a little too short. The crotch rides high while the chest area runs low. Glad I also purchased a skirt to cover below. Still happy with the purchase but I should have bought a size up."
4.0,These earrings are very nice. The only problem is they are very small. They are perfect for a 2nd hole earring.
4.0,"Loved the lace! It was beautiful in photos and was perfect for the beach family photos I took but the sleeves where the lace is was very delicate, I had to be careful not to stretch out the fabric. Definitely not a durable dress."
4.0,Got this for my mom for Christmas it was beautiful and shiny! Didn‚Äôt look cheap and in great condition! Also very good at fitting different wrist sizes
4.0,"A bit on the small side, but you can stretch it out.  The clasp is absolutely useless, but you really don't need it to stay on your wrist, so I don't use it.  Not the appropriate clasp for a brecelet.  A great price for what you get, I love the flowers."
4.0,"Great looking, soft Hoodie in longer length and white zipper accent.  Love the style."
4.0,"The dress is very nice , but the color is not for me! But I liked the dress in general. I ordered a large,returned and re ordered an XL in charcoal"
4.0,Petite necklace that canbe worn everyday.
4.0,"The material is thin so I wasn't sure how it would be received, but my daughter in law loved it and wore it the next day."
4.0,It was cute for our daughters piggie Halloween costume. Most of the nose pieces available were irritating to her face so I thought this was a good solution. But it fits really oddly. It cut into her neck on the bottom if she tilted her head down even a little. I had to cut out the foam to make it usable.
4.0,Good product service.
4.0,Works well bought it for myself but size runs small<br />My wife loves it though
4.0,Cute! Like the material. The seams are a little itchy though. Looks really nice on
4.0,"The pattern is a bit small, but the mask protects me from the fumes of my rabbits' litter boxes. I like to look a little kawaii when I clean up their area, is all I'm sayin."
4.0,XL does fit 38DDDs BUT the bottoms are very saggy on me. I wish I could get the pants in a smaller size
4.0,"I really like this dress and it fits well. My only complaint which is an easy fix is it's super wrinkly. I am 5'9"", about 145 pounds and a large fits me just right. Length too."
4.0,Supper comfortable. Easy to wear. Dress up or dressed down.
4.0,"I received multiple compliments on this shirt the first time I wore it, so I guess it is pretty cute.<br />Regarding the cut, the size was as expected, but the bodice lacing hit me deeper then on the model in the picture (the lacing went farther down on me). So I wore a tank top under it to avoid my bra being visible through the bodice laces, but it did not hurt the look of the shirt any.  I also liked the length, which is a bit longer than most tops, and allows me to pair it with different items in my closet.<br />  The quality of the top is okay, not great, not bad.  It was a cheap shirt so I am not surprised or disappointed by with the quality though.  The red fabric is thin but not see through, and it is stitched well, so if I hand wash it and hang it to dry it should last months, but it is not a durable product, which is unfortunate."
4.0,Super cute but definitely didn't fit my bust.
4.0,"The shorts fit perfectly in all areas except the top buttoned waistline. It has drawstrings to make the waist smaller, but unless you're into the ""you're pants are 3 sizes to big but don't need a belt"" look, I don't think many people would need the drawstring. I didn't want to go up a size because they shorts would be too big in the legs."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at fit.  Was very roomy and extremely comfortable.
4.0,I get lots of compliments when I wear this to my martial arts class.it is just made of some regular cloth which keeps the sweat from falling into my eyes without squeezing my head like the stretchable headbands do.
4.0,Nicely made and I enjoy it. Very pretty too.
4.0,Lovely pendant. Substantial size.
4.0,"I like the dress. I would say it's worth the price. However, the sizing chart is WAY off for this dress.  It was huge on me.  I had to return it and order 2 sizes down."
4.0,"The design is simple, and the material is decent. It's not all leather though. Some parts, like the purse's bottom and undersides of the strap are PU leather, but I can take that for its price point of $25. The size is just right. I mainly bought this for the size and color, and it didn't disappoint. The shade of green is the kind that can go with most outfits. The quality of the workmanship is good. Stitching is clean, and the bag is well balanced. It keeps its shape when set down. It has feet. It comes with many pockets and three compartments. Middle compartment is tiny and good for smaller things, like a compact, lipstick, and tissues. The style can go from casual to semi-formal. Zippers are kinda cheap but acceptable. I LOVE that this purse doesn't have a logo on it. It is clean, clean, clean! My only complaint is that the strap is weirdly designed. If I lengthen the strap, one end can be riveted, while one end is just hanging loose, and the other rivet is just sitting on the opposite side of the strap. It looks and feels odd. The company seems to be imitating Dooney and Bourke's shoulder straps on their hobo bags for that designer look. I would have preferred a regular strap instead of an imitation design that doesn't work. It's a decent bag overall."
4.0,"I love these bracelets.  This is the 4th one I've bought.  They're made way better than Alex and Ani bracelets (unless they've made those better than they used to be - I quit buying A&A).  They're sturdy and the little charms don't fall off.  Good deal, too."
4.0,I'm Happy with Emolly fashion handmade polarized bamboo wood sunglasses. They look fashion forward and they block the sun. I cant wait to take them on vacation and pair them with some outfits.  The case is really nice and a added piece I wasn't expecting.
4.0,"I have been looking for a white shirt that is comfortable, can wear during the fall and winter, and can be dressed up or down. This will work with jeans or dress pants with a blazer. But (yes there‚Äôs a but), I am short so it fits a bit weird around the middle. If you have some extra weight, it‚Äôs not very flattering on its own. Last, I am expecting a bit more care will be required as this isn‚Äôt wrinkle free material."
4.0,Item was satisfactory!  My students enjoyed
4.0,Well made. Nice band for the price.
4.0,"The heart charm was not as shiny and smooth as I expected in it's appearance, but for the price and it's appearance overall I was satisfied."
4.0,"The fabric portion of this hoodie is great quality and an attractive design which could be unisex‚Äîmy husband likes this a lot and I think he‚Äôs taking it :-). It has kangaroo style pockets in the front, and a drawstring at the neck.  It‚Äôs quite thick and heavy for cold weather.  The extra large/XL woman‚Äôs size is about a man‚Äôs large/L.  This does have the warning label required by the State of California for proposition 65.  The only metal on the entire hoodie is the two grommets where the drawstring comes out.  The warning label is because those grommets apparently contain lead and cadmium.  The laundry tag says to machine wash cold and tumble dry low.  It‚Äôs 60% cotton and 40% polyester which means it won‚Äôt shrink and shouldn‚Äôt wrinkle after washing."
4.0,It was a pretty pattern. The colours were vibrant but the material was not very soft. Might have softened up with washing but I returned it so I don't know. Definitely not flimsy material though.  Also the waist was too high on me.  It looked like an empire waist dress. Also the seller apparently donates 50 percent of the profit to charity.
4.0,The flannel comes just like the picture but if you want a snuggle fit i recommend you to get like 2-3 sizes up. I'm usually a small and I got a XL (asian size) and its still pretty small on me. The sleeves fit great and it's not tight anywhere but I just wanted it to come below my butt. For reference I'm 5'2. I'll still wear it though
4.0,"My son loves the shoes, and they are definitely very cool. I gave them a 4 because they are a little small..my son is still in a size 7 toddler, but the smallest size they had available was 8.5 toddler, so, I just went ahead and got them. I tried them on him, and they fit with about a half inch between his toes and the tip of the shoe. I would recommend sizing up."
4.0,I have been wearing non-stop for 2-3 weeks now. Color on the links are the same. The clasp is fading. Thin enough that people think it's real. It would be 5 stars if the clasp didn't fade.
4.0,I do like this shirt....the color is pretty too....<br />I am a somewhat small woman but curvy so I ordered the XL expecting it to be big like the picture shows. No way.....Its about half the size fit from what the picture shows.....anything smaller than an XL for a size 6 woman would fit like a regular shirt
4.0,"This dress was too tight across bust and I am only a 38 C. Also the style put emphasis on belly, may be good for a maternity dress but not for someone with a belly."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 200 pounds and it was just a little tight. I usually wear a xl -1x but I ordered a 2x just because I wanted to be safe but I needed to get a 3x because I didn‚Äôt feel like sucking in my stomach all night lol otherwise super cute dress!
4.0,"Really great style, but way too big for my taste!  Seems sturdy, with nice packaging.  Ill just give to my 22 yr old daughter!"
4.0,I love the shrug. The ties are a bit longer than necessary but a cute accessory to dress up jeans or leggings
4.0,Like the size and slimness of it  phone fits easily (I phone 6) only complaint is the zipper catches a little. Maybe because it‚Äôs so new ?
4.0,"These are beautiful! My only complaint was they didn't come with backs, but that's easily solved!"
4.0,"Muy buen producto, llego en excelente estado, tiene un estilo muy elegante y viene con una pila adicional.<br />Lo unico para mejorar es que llego en una minibolsa de burbujas de aire y al llegar con otros productos puede da√±arse, deberian empacarlo asi sea en una caja sencilla"
4.0,"Bought too big. Didn‚Äôt have my size and thought they would shrink but they don‚Äôt. Material stretchy, good quality. The length is perfect just wish I bought size smaller"
4.0,"These are nice sunglasses. They are a little big for me, but I have a small head. They block a lot of the brightness, which is great for me as I am extremely sensitive. They are very lightweight and feel like they would break easy, but so far so good."
4.0,Like the belt it just needs a better piece of material to hold the extra belt when making it tighter
4.0,My son liked them. Fit well and have been holding up thru repeated washes.
4.0,Love this dress. Nice quality but too tight in bust. Unfortunately had to return it.
4.0,"I have been wearing this bracelet for a few days, so I am still learning all about it, and what it does. So far I when I wear it, I feel a slight sensation on my wrist. After wearing it I can still feel it for a few minutes. As far as pain relief, at work I experience pain in my hands and wrist. I work with my hands a lot with my job, so its something that I experience on a regular basis. I have found that since wearing this, the discomfort in my hands and wrist has went down a good 50% so far.<br /><br />This bracelet is easily able to be formed to any size wrist. It is pretty flexible which is nice, however I'm anxious to see how well this holds up over time.<br /><br />So far I am happy with this, and I look forward to seeing the long term results from using this! I'll update if anything changes!<br /><br />Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review."
4.0,"Narrow by the two area and you might want to order a size up. Still a nice dressy or even casual pair of shoes. The chunky heel was nice so she didn't break an ankle, so that's a plus. :)"
4.0,"Good quality, somewhat large but I guess that means my boy will get to wear it for a little longer."
4.0,"I love how these shoes look, they are so beautiful and go well with just anything I‚Äôs put on!<br />They are made with high quality material and feel very comfortable, but I just have this weird feeling that one is taller than the other when I walk. My legs are the same size, I never had this feeling while walking before, so that‚Äôs some weird fact to consider. IDK. Weird, but I still like and will keep wearing these shoes."
4.0,"This item is very small, which I read the description given by the seller before ordering , so I knew it would be smaller than expected when I ordered. So when it arrived, I wasnt sure if it would fit me or not, I kinda expected it might not fit but if it didnt, I could give to my daughter. Thats is what happen ,  it didnt fit me so I gave it to my daughter who loves ahs, so it worked out. She loves it, she put it on immediately. She said its her favorite new hoodie.<br />I would say that this is a nice medium heavy material.<br />Has cuffed sleeves.  They design is very nice, and  is what I expected it to be.<br />Overall it is a very nice hoodie, just made extremely small. Just make sure you go by the seller sizing when ordering.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Cute jacket but was big on me and I usually wear a XL in jackets.
4.0,"I have bought about four of these dresses and I love, love, love three out of four of them. I bought a large and I'm 5'7"" 180lbs. They fit perfect in the top and waist!<br /><br />However, each dress was a different length depending on the pattern of dress. And one of the dresses seemed like it was a different material, because it was thicker. That seemed odd to me and I didn't like it as much. So, I gave it four stars because of this. I would love it if they were all the same length and fabric! I really wanted to buy lots more of these, but now I'm worried I'm going to get one that's going to be shorter length and thicker material. Sigh."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 125lbs, and based on the size chart I ordered a medium. I'm thinking I could have gotten away with a small because it's the tiniest bit loose in the top/arms (I have a small chest, so that doesn't help!) but it is so comfy and the roominess helps it stay comfy. The navy/red color is wonderful, the pockets are fantastic, and I'm excited to wear this dress!"
4.0,The length is perfect for me
4.0,"Unfortunately, the first time I wore it the charm came off the bracelet, and I needed to have it soldered back on"
4.0,"I normally wear US size 2 Dress. I'm 5'3&#34; 118Lb with less curves. I read the reviews and looked at size chart in the images then ordered size 4 for this dress. Even though, I bought size 4 I feel like it's bit small. I like tighter than loose. So, I'm going to keep it anyway."
4.0,I needed a larger size.
4.0,This jacket is incredibly warm and comfortable. Very high quality feeling. I only took a star away because after zipping it up one time I walked around and the zipper came undone from the bottom. I was able to get the zipper back down but it doesn't stay closed which is a bummer.
4.0,Dress runs a little big. I generally wear small/medium and ordered a small and the dress is still a little baggy. But perfect for a quick throw over dress for vacation and when I go to the beach. Love the tassels!
4.0,"expecting these are well fitted for the competition  next year in Alaska, needed to test them in freezing cold temperatures for the review if it can stand for there product"
4.0,"They run a tad bit tight, but overall I love these!  They have like a gel coated backing to them that keep them from slipping under the arch of the foot.  I will definitely buy more!"
4.0,Good quality for price. Pretty color and shape.
4.0,"At 6' tall and 120lbs, falling right between the S and M, I'd recommend others go with the small. Both are 88cm long, I think, which is plenty for a dress like this. The sides are too large and gaping at the back and I think it would look better if it were a bit tighter, may return for a new size. Lined well."
4.0,"LOVE the blue color - rhinestones on this one are VERY TINY, however - can hardly notice them"
4.0,Nice earrings with a reminder of the old days!
4.0,only draw back was they were a pain to get into place in the frames. The original lenses popped in and out with ease while these were much harder to get into place.
4.0,"It looks fine. Not great, but fine"
4.0,"I love this product, fit as expected and material is great. I'm 52 years old and I feel very comfortable in this swimwear."
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this watch!!  Beautiful design!!  Nice heavy weight, love the see-through back on the watch.  You do need to wear it daily is you want it to keep time due to its mechanical winding feature--but if you should lapse, it is easy to reset.  This watch had everything I wanted in a watch.  I just may buy a second watch as a back-up to this on in case it gets broken."
4.0,Maybe a smaller frame but not child size. Ok for slim face.
4.0,"These are great shirts for working out, nothing really wrong with them other than the material isn't the most comfortable."
4.0,If you like pink get it (IT IS NOT RED the material is almost like a swimsuit material but it‚Äôs 20 bucks and I wanted it for the print.
4.0,Very nice I hope it doesn‚Äôt change colors after a lil wild of wearing it
4.0,Very pretty! If you are purchasing as a gift. Know these only come in a small zip top bag. You may want to plan for a box. Otherwise very nice.
4.0,"The design is exactly as advertised and very cute! They are a tiny bit big for my liking but not too bad, great product"
4.0,This red is REALLY red. It has that tailored fit and it feels nice.
4.0,Good fit not as dark as my old ones which would be way better.  Ladies they will get caught  in your hair and pull it.
4.0,Like the open toe
4.0,"This is a nice garment.  It fits well and the length is adequate, falling below my knees."
4.0,"Nice quality and good fit, but the color was very fifferent than what was shown."
4.0,"Great quality and fabric.  Heavy and well made.  Like that they hug my body and therefore fit well under shirts and sweaters without bunching up.  Will buy again, even at the price which is higher than I would normally pay.  Bought them because I was so disenchanted by name brand shirts.  Thought I would give something else a try, knowing that I could return them to Amazon if not what expected."
4.0,This item is a great fit and look very good with a simple dressy shell. I was wore this to our tea party and it was the talk of the tea party. This was a great buy. I am sorry I only bought one. I would buy again but it took a long time for it to be delivered that was my only regret.
4.0,"I love this jumper and got a lot of compliments on it. I am 5'10 185lbs and I ordered a medium. Other than the length it fit just right and its comfortable. The leg fell just above my ankle but was not a big deal because it's summer time and just add some cute sandals and go! Also I wish there were accurate U.S. sizes listed. It would make it a lot easier to pick your size, I took a gamble with the medium and got lucky. :-)"
4.0,My brother really enjoyed it. The only thing I can say negatively is that the shipping box said there was a battery in it but when we opened it there wasn't one. And it takes like a watch battery. I don't understand if it doesn't have a battery included why say theres a battery on the shipped packaging?
4.0,"This is a great bag. Lots of room inside and lots of pockets for organizing. My co-workers were jealous of my bad and kept asking me where I got it from. The only issue I had with this bag was the seller folded the bad for packing and shipping. Unfortunately, doing this caused my bad to have a crease in it which drove me crazy. Other than that, happy with this purchase."
4.0,"PROS: fabric is dense and kind of heavy but jacket is not thick. Reflective piping front and back helps nighttime visibility. Hood and sleeves zip off‚Äîyou can partially unzip the sleeves for pit ventilation, which is great while running. There is a zipped inside pocket. Love the motorcycle jacket styling especially sans hood. Fit is great for me: I have square shoulders, chest 38‚Äù, hips 40‚Äù. The size Medium leaves enough room to layer a sweater underneath. Does well against wind. The fabric has some stretch for added comfort. I wore this with silk and wool underlayers while snowshoeing (28 degrees and sun) and it was fabulous.<br /><br />CONS: as you can see in the picture, it is not waterproof. I had walked about 35 minutes in light rain before this picture and the jacket did not hold integrity. The water seeped through especially at the chest seams. This does not bode well for actual running in actual rain. Also, the hood is too big (no adjustment in the back) and the sleeves are too long on me. Granted, I am not a guy, so my arms are on the short side. And, as others have mentioned, the bottom height of the pocket zippers in the front make it uncomfortable to rest your hands inside. Fine for holding your phone or leaving unzipped for extra ventilation, but not cozy for hands.<br /><br />All in all, I think it‚Äôs a great coat with a lot of versatility, especially for the price. Just not waterproof like advertised."
4.0,"The short are very simple, nice padding, makes cycling more comfortable.<br />Some people have commented on the size.  I think they are sized appropriately.  I normally buy small, so I bought these shorts in small and they fit fine.  So I wouldn't advise anyone to buy a size bigger.<br /><br />My only problem is with the cheepish material. The material is plain shiny spandex."
4.0,"This shirt is loose and comfy...I'd call the fabric almost ""slinky"" as it's so soft and flexible. Love how it feels.<br /><br />My only complaint is the little square on the front. It's just not even, which annoys me.<br /><br />Note that the color is darker than it appears in my photo. It's a really pretty pink."
4.0,Love al these colors very bright. But smelly hopefully they will wear away
4.0,"The shirt is of great quality, material wise. I just wish it had a more feminine fit on the torso, Its loose and wide there and the sleeves were too short, they sit about an inch above my wrist and ride up all day. I am 5‚Äô10 although so I am not too displeased."
4.0,Ordered this year for the first time for my yearly fantasy football league. The guys in the league had an absolute blast using this board and we will continue too in the future. Only bad part is we had to do a lot of write in names.
4.0,"This is very pretty, it is warm and soft. It makes a nice shawl as it is a rectangle and not a square. It does shed a little but not too bad. I‚Äôm very happy with this."
4.0,Nice tie clip enhanced style for any tie I'm happy with it
4.0,"Love the bracelet, fits perfect, color a little duller than expected."
4.0,The material holds up after washing. I like the style.
4.0,Nice necklace but it was delivered all knotted up. It was a birthday present. Had to take away a star for that.
4.0,It was what I expected. The quality was a bit low on the Tee.
4.0,"Perfect size, lots of pockets."
4.0,"Looks good, great for biking."
4.0,A plus seller
4.0,"Although the product title indicates ""Winter Thermal Yoga Pants""; the two I purchased are not thermal or fleece lined.  It does indicate (no Fleece lined) next to the color choice.  Just a contradiction to be aware of.  Still, I like the weight and fit of this yoga pant.  I am usually a size 12-14; but I purchased the XXL.  I usually buy a bigger size yoga pant, from any seller, so they're not sprayed on."
4.0,"Fine for the price, a little thin, but some extra cushion at the heel"
4.0,I love the value of 4 masks in the set and especially glittery ones and at a very reasonable price.
4.0,"Comfortable and spacious to wear. Everything a hoody should be! Fits to your typical size. Pockets are placed perfectly to rest your hands. Washes and does dry nicely, doesn‚Äôt pill or leave little balls on the sweatshirt. Great piece!"
4.0,It is a cute shirt. I am 5'3&#34; and 145 lbs.  Wear a 8-10 size pant and  I normally wear a medium top. I ordered a large to hopefully get a more relaxed look.  I am glad I ordered a large it fits fairly snug
4.0,"I love the colors most of all. I got the wine and it's exactly as pictured.  Depending on your body type, this may or may not work.  The style is cute, however if you have a long torso, it might not look as cute on you."
4.0,"I like this ring, I wear it often. Not too big, but the silver is beginning to tarnish on the prongs."
4.0,"I was expecting it to be like my regular glasses where there is no line it is progressive. These are actually bifocals. Other than that they are nice and light and rather cute, fit well."
4.0,Unfortunately the band is too big. I‚Äôve bought multiple sizes and disappointingly nothing fits
4.0,Fit my Apple Watch SE perfectly.  One of the magnets came out one time.  Did not need to glue it back in and haven‚Äôt had it pop out again.  Does not pull the tiny arm hairs like I expected it to
4.0,"It was as expected, I just wish it was able to hold more. It will be more of a specialty or occasional wallet for those who need to carry more."
4.0,Over all these are good.  The buttons are in the wrong place.
4.0,Cool Bracelet for the price. Nice fit and look. combine with all kind of appareal you wear at all ocassion.
4.0,If your not busty it‚Äôs big in the boob area.
4.0,I like it... Its very beautiful
4.0,Really  nice material but its too small. I ordered  3t for my 20 month old and it was tight on her and the shirt was too short and snug.
4.0,One was missing a ball but the seller was so sweet and she replaced them. We love this jewelry!!!!!
4.0,Fancy enough for office work or play down with jeans or shorts for summer! Fits a tad bit small so you might want to size up. I‚Äôm usually a small with a long back. It was a little shorter than I like so my next one I will get a medium
4.0,"Bracelet is really nice. Gets compliments.  Terribly overpriced! Vendor catches you with hype about charity. I‚Äôm sure there is some ‚Äòbenevolence‚Äô but not enough to justify that kind of asking price. I liked the bracelet so much I was going to buy the hematite version. The didn‚Äôt have it in stock. Thank God! Found it on eBay for a 1/4 of the price. Yes, the same item ‚Äòwater dropletüíß‚Äô and all. It‚Äôs all wholesale Chinese craft marked up unconscionably. Yes, I said it. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
4.0,I purchased the black and silver bracelets. One of the silver pieces fell off. I would like to have the male bracelet replaced. I do not see the black bracelets on the website any longer. If nothing else I would like a silver piece to replace the one that fell off. We love our bracelets.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my wife. I really love the design of it. My wife has a beautiful, body so she really makes the dress looks better. It fit her perfectly."
4.0,"Fits well, nice soft fabric that doesn't make me too hot, washes well, and looks pretty.  My only complaint is sometimes when I'm tossing in my sleep the ruffles at the bottom bunch up and I feel like I am sleeping on a lump.  Otherwise it's cute and worth the fair price."
4.0,"This band feels a bit more &#34;rubbery&#34; than the original.  Not perfect for handling sweat when exercising as the rubbery-feel tends to rub against my wrist in a &#34;grippy&#34; way a bit more than the original.  The original felt a bit firmer, silkier and more confident against my skin.<br /><br />Of course, price makes all the difference in this review!  Considering the cheaper price of the V-MORO band compared to the original, I'm definitely quite satisfied with it.  You can live with the rubbery feel, even while exercising.  It's a good substitute for the price and I will be ordering more colors soon.  Consider the 4-pack if you like the colors, since it's a much better value than buying individually."
4.0,Fits fine and material is good quality...
4.0,"These are nice sun glasses, very sturdy and fit well."
4.0,A more snug shoe that typical but my daughter loves them
4.0,i have a large bunion and my large toe tends to go on top of my 2nd toe when i walk. who would have thought that these nice thick sox keep my toes apart and have tremendously helped my foot/toe pain. great. they say knee sox but are a bit too long or i would have given them a 5. i have to fold them over.
4.0,Haven't worn it out yet but it looks great. I'll update the post later.
4.0,"I ordered 2. One was great and the other wasn‚Äôt that great. The one that was great was not a closeup photo. The one that was not great was a closeup photo. Next time, I will order with a not so closeup photo."
4.0,"It's a good bracket, nothing wrong there. Kinda odd that the grips did not come in the packaging at all, not sure where they went or why they weren't included."
4.0,Great band but it‚Äôs magnetized so it‚Äôs easily shifted and you can‚Äôt really get it tight on the arm. Best for dates and outings not for working out
4.0,They look pretty nice and are quite durable! Some of the keychains though you can tell were glued on. Never knew it glowed until I played around one day with them. Definitely will buy again!
4.0,This jacket is very sweatery. I haven't found a sweater that's more sweatery than this one. Highly recommend if you're cold.
4.0,Had to exchange for my usual size.  I went with the size chart recommendation and it was too loose to be supportive.  Very cute and different style.
4.0,the first time I could find compression socks that fit & can wear all day & not be in pain. stopped the pain in my calf & in the foot. There was one pair of brown ones smaller then all the others but in the past 4 months in a wheel chair & knee walker the 5 pair are great so I can go 10 days without running out of support on the right foot and leg. Wish I had seen these back in Sept. when the foot doctor told me I had to wear them but I really am happy that I have them now.
4.0,Just what my daughter was looking for.
4.0,"Everything is fine, the product came out to be what I was expecting."
4.0,"( Bought 4-6 ) My measurements: Waist 27in Hips 36in Bust 34in. Height 4'9.<br />It fits me very nicely and is even a little bit bigger. It is pretty baggy around my waist which I really like.<br /><br />Positive:<br />~ The gray part is soft and the plaid part is more rough but it is pretty comfortable.<br />~ Baggy/ loose pretty much everywhere the only place it is tight is my shoulders.<br />~Not hot, it is actually thin but not thin enough to see through. Which is good where I live.<br />~ shipping was very fast, I was not expected to get it  November 3rd- November 22nd. ( came on 10/20/16)<br /><br />Negative: I only have two things to say negative about this.<br />~ It had a lot of loose strings. Not a major negative thing I just cut them off.<br />~ it is a little tight on the shoulders. Not on the top but on the back of them."
4.0,"I just upped this to 4 stars over my previous review because I find myself wearing them all the time instead of my more expensive socks. Still not sure if they will last but for the price, style, and comfort, that's ok. The expensive kind doesn't last either. I will probably buy another set."
4.0,"Perfect size for fitting underneath airlines seat, just a little bit snug for the aisle seat. Lots of pockets to assist with organizing items, wish there were a few added pouches in the smaller front pocket."
4.0,"Very high waisted, just be aware. Love them otherwise."
4.0,"I was surprised how well this dress fit.  I bought a large.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 146 pounds, 56 years old, normally wear a size 12 to 14 to fit my bust.  I received many compliments, especially from the 30ish crowd."
4.0,Beautiful but thin.
4.0,My son was happy with this gift. he finds it very comfortable to ware
4.0,Somewhat small for a 2x but very stretchy so I'm good.
4.0,Taking on a cruise in December.  Will be great for what I wanted it for.
4.0,So cute but super itchy!! Must wear some layers underneath to relieve the itch! I recommend for the looks but comfort level is well zero!
4.0,This is the product for you  if your looking for a plastic look and want it to be water resistant.  It will hold all your items with its zipper compartment in and outside the bag.  A good value on this toiletry bag....
4.0,"Wore it for my birthday , it was gorgeous üòç"
4.0,"i loved this two piece & it resembles the photo accurately. the material feels nice, i love the cut of the bikini, & it flatters my pear body shape nicely. the top & bottoms are adjustable because they have a tie closure.<br /><br />one thing i will note is that the top is NOT for busty babes. i‚Äôm a 40C & my breasts barely fit in this top. i feel like one wrong move & it‚Äôs game over so, i‚Äôll probably just use this for sun bathing or photos only. nonetheless, still a cute two piece."
4.0,This dress is much shorter than I expected it to be. I love the color and the fit but the length is kind of annoying.
4.0,Pretty great!
4.0,I loved it. I am 5'1 170lbs and I ordered my normal size the large. I could have gotten a size lower to make it fit more hugging. Either way i can get away with it. I loved the dress and can`t wait to wear it.
4.0,Like thw socks but sizes are small.
4.0,Very cute! I love the color. The only thing is when you look at it closely you see small imperfections such as the glue that holds the crystal onto the metal part.
4.0,"The wallet arrived as pictured. The card slots are very tight, at first. Over a month, cards slide in and out easily. The wallet arrived with a very strong smell and continues to smell. After a week of airing it out, I just gave up and started using it, still with a strong smell. Even after over a month, it still smells (which I've gotten over)."
4.0,Pricey but very nice
4.0,"5‚Äô3‚Äù at ~110lbs. Got the Small and it fits fine. More baggy than I was expecting considering other reviews and the sleeve length is fine for me. Got these to layer up for my bike commutes in the winter and was surprised to find the gray sweater is far thinner than the other two. I got the grey, black, and blue pack. The photos show just how thin the gray one is- light comes through significantly. Could be a good thing for the not so cold days but I find the inconsistency in thickness to be strange.<br /><br />Update- in the review approval process my review was edited (not by me). The photo showing how opaque they gray sweater is was replaced with my photo of the black sweater. So now there‚Äôs one photo of the blue sweater and two of the black. Suspicious activity on the sellers part‚Ä¶?"
4.0,"This is a beautiful vest, I purchased it for my father, when it arrived it was much too small I ordered an XL, which I thought may even be too big ' since my father is a large, this vest didn't even fit myself, and I am a women's size medium."
4.0,"purchased this as a gift for my sister, she said they are comfortable and that she likes them.. but feels like the pocket stitching could've been done a bit better.."
4.0,My grand ended up liking the feel of the flannel lol material  so we didn't retire lol I was preparing to do so glad he's very picky<br />Size true and discription look a bit better than actually is a little pricy for the quality but my grand is picky so I'm happy
4.0,This product works
4.0,It looks fine.
4.0,...some dollars and credit cards will fit so for a night out this would be good. It holds maybe 5 bills folded up and doesn't make any difference in the amount of the bill and  maybe 4 cards. It will fit in a pocket of your pants or jacket just so you can keep track of it.<br /><br />The leather isn't thin but I'm sure with use it compresses some too. Not an expensive gift and children would love to give Dad this.
4.0,"They look somewhat small for a size 9/10 women‚Äôs shoe size. We will see as they are part of a Christmas gift.  They are very cite though, sure hope they fit her."
4.0,Bought as a gift. Just as described. Daughter loves them!
4.0,"This is a very cute outfit, when ordering keep in mind that the fabric is light and airy so there is no stretch."
4.0,"This bracelet is very cute, but i think definitely is for little girls. It looks more like a toy bracelet than a jewelry. It comes in a nice pink sac and the tie system is super easy to lock and unlock. Perfect gift for a kid."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and 145 pounds.  I wore this dress with a petticoat to get the look I wanted.  I love the material of the dress -- it stretches a bit and washes well.  You just hang it up to dry and don't need to iron it.  I think this will be a good dress to take when I travel because it's so easy to care for.  I like the color choices and will probably order another one.  I chose one of the butterfly patterns and it is so pretty for spring and has a fun feel to it.  I think this is a unique and lovely dress."
4.0,"The hats were a little big for the 5 yr. olds, but we just used the bandanas folded up like a headband, and they were fine."
4.0,Exactly what my 4 yr old wanted for her birthday. She was thrilled with it. Quality could have been better but for the price was an overall good buy.
4.0,"Great for a VERY slim girl. My daughter is 8, tall and thin, but this was too tight."
4.0,"Nice earrings, well made, but they look nothing like the picture. The picture looks like gems or rhinestones but they are not shinny at all. They look more marble. (Like a bowling ball)"
4.0,Love the fit. The boots work well in our muddy landscape after the rains.
4.0,"Love the color and the style, but I ordered in a smaller size thinking it would't be too big."
4.0,"Nicely made. Overall it‚Äôs small, short sleeves for me. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù 115lb, bought size 4. Normally I buy size 0 or 2. Sleeves barely reach the wrists. Long enough to tackle inside the pants.It should be perfect for someone 5‚Äô5‚Äù , maybe. I kept it, because I like it."
4.0,"Really really cute but the border at the bottom didn‚Äôt line up correctly. It was a little off. Material is a little strange, it looks a little faded black in areas. I may try to lighter color dress with more beige: brown / green pattern. Because it is a great price for a cute summery dress"
4.0,bella y tela muy buena
4.0,The item runs small. And you only get a partial credit the 20% they do not make exchange so you have to keep it
4.0,broke after a month from one fall.
4.0,"Like the fit n the look, it‚Äôs a teeny tiny big but that‚Äôs ok since I wear my bun tucked under it. Keeps my head warm. I took the emblem off of it and replaced it with a sparkly butterfly barrette, other than that it works!"
4.0,I really like this tunic. It's a little snug so I'm worried about washing it. Won't go in the dryer which means ironing. But as long as it doesn't shrink all should be fine.
4.0,Thought the bite piece would be more silicone not plastic
4.0,"These ties are great if you are looking to add some different colors to your collection.<br /><br />The material that these ties are made of is nice. It‚Äôs not super soft but it‚Äôs not super rough it‚Äôs just right in the middle.<br /><br />One slight negative about these ties is that they wrinkle pretty easily. After wearing it all day (8-10 hours), it was pretty wrinkled. I assume this would be expected but I was not expecting it since the other ties that I own do not wrinkle as much as these do. It is definitely recommend to hang these ties up or roll them up when they are not being worn. If folded you might have to iron out the folds. I did have to iron out the fold by placing a light towel or sheet over the top and iron out the wrinkles but they came out fairly easily. Other than that there really isn‚Äôt anything else bad I would have to say about these ties.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this box of neckties if you are looking for quality and variety. They are worth saving money to iron out a few folds if needed."
4.0,I like the feel of material but it definitely runs small. Instead of getting a large to be fitted I should‚Äôve got an XL maybe even XXL.
4.0,"Very cute, which it was off the shoulder more, but cute!"
4.0,"The wallet worked very well. However, at one point, I had my husband's passport & mine in it, and several receipts, and the wallet wouldn't snap! It would be great if it had another snap to allow for a little more bulge!"
4.0,"Been thinking of buying this for a few years now. Finally took the plunge. It has enough pockets. It has a long chain that lets the clutch fall to about hip height on one shoulder. I'm able to strap it cross-body comfortably and I'm a plus sized girl. I wish the black zelda patch wasn't where it is. It's kinda tacky, but imo, it doesn't detract from the overall effect.<br />I've been using this for about a month and the green color is rubbing off the edges already from being inside my very large, very soft-interior purse. It fits my phone (without a case) in the zipper compartment, dollars, coupons, several cards and I don't have to struggle to pull my ID out of the windowed slot.<br /><br />Overall, I love it. But I feel like it could be better. The zipper is cheaply made, both inside and outside, but I've certainly used much cheaper.<br /><br />It's really exactly what I wanted and needed."
4.0,"very comfy but not suitable for any kind of wok out just a comfy wear when you need a little coverage but dont feel like strapping the ladies down. the strips do slip a little on the shoulder for me and the lift is practically no existant but im a 36DD so i might be asking a little much of this bra, definitely remove the pads prior to washing and replace after drying. they pop in and out easily if the sleek outer material on the pads stays intact its a nightmare to reposition the pads after washing and drying if you leave the pads in and the silky cover on the pads comes off. if the pads need to be was between uses then gently hand wash and air dry. i have read lots of reviews about the pads and washing but though egggg i just wash them, it'll be fine, the whole removing and replacing thing seems like a pain. trust me don't do this."
4.0,I love this vest. Flowy and very fun to wear. Wrinkles pretty easily but responds well to wrinkle release spray. Launders well without losing shape. Makes the most casual outfit suddenly striking and a bit dramatic. Absolutely recommended.
4.0,Love the style of the bracelet.  Be careful very easy to bend.  It was a little tarnished; but still a great buy .  Nice gift for a child  or  a teen.
4.0,Very pretty dress.....  Pay attention to the measurements when ordering size. I am normally a sz 16 US and i purchased the 2X which fits ok. I've gotten complements and I like that the dress is cool and breezy.  Dress is in the wash now so I hope it washes well.
4.0,"This dress was really well made and fit as described.  I returned it only because it was too long for my 5'6""."
4.0,"Cute sleeves, but there was a fairly large gap in the seam that I will have to sew to repair."
4.0,"These are very reasonably priced, and we‚Äôre really cute to wear when I dressed up a little bit. Be warned they are heavy! Our adult daughter loved them so much, I ended up, sending them home with her!"
4.0,"Nice, breathable material.  Light weight.  Runs a little small and snug when aroundthe neck.  Bought these for my 10 year old son to wear to school around his neck since Covid so he didn't need to keep remembering where he put his mask but it may be to snug to wear all day."
4.0,"Love the laces, they stay put, are comfy and make getting the shoes on and off quickly a breeze.  The directions suck though.  Lacing them in can be tricky.  Nothing on the package but a website link that led to very unclear directions.  The laces are so great I would use them as my ""stocking stuffer"" this year, but not until I have time to draw up my own instruction sheet, using the steps outlined below. The first shoe lacing can be a real pain, but when you get to the second shoe it will seem easy. Then you will start replacing the laces in all of your shoes.  Does Goodwill take used shoe laces?<br /><br />1. Hold the laces with the large plastic clip facing down.  Pull a loop about 1/2-2 inches out, and lock the clip to hold the loop by pushing up on the center plastic strip.<br />2. Still with the logo facing down, start at the top of the shoe (by your ankle) and lace down to the bottom (if you have those little tabs to help hold the shoe tongue up, make sure that you lace through those as well.)<br />3.) Once you have finished lacing down towards the toe of the shoe, hold the other little plastic clip with the wide base of the triangle towards the toe of the shoe. The grove in the little clip should be facing up. Put each lace through a hole on the wide end of the triangle and head them back up towards the top of the shoe (your ankle)again.<br />4.) Pull each lace sharply out to the side to lock them into the little clip.<br />5.) Go back to the loop at the top clip (near your ankle) and pull that loop down to the little clip. The top loop will fit in the groove of the little clip.  The logo should then be facing up, and the top loop should stretch a bit to fit into the little clip on the lower loop.<br />6.) Now the try the shoes on and tweak a bit until they are comfortably tight, but you can still easily slide the shoes off.<br />8.) Take the laces that are sticking out at the bottom, and just tuck those loosely into the side of the shoe (under the sides that are laced.)<br />9.) VERY IMPORTANT, wear the shoes for a few days and make sure that they fit comfortably. If not, adjust as needed.<br />10.) Once you are sure that they are fit correctly, you can cut the end laces to make them shorter (but still long enough to tuck about 1/2 inch into the shoe sides.)<br />11.) Before you tuck the cut laces, I would suggest that you paint each cut lace end with clear nail polish, and let it dry to prevent unraveling."
4.0,So she got this one and another. She loves the Puka shell items. I think they have made a comeback. She is happy with her Puka shell. She likes the matching anklet too. Nice gift items.
4.0,The choker arrived in perfect time and looked just as expected.  The packaging did have a musty smell and had to air it outside. Otherwise very happy.
4.0,"I love these glasses as I am horrible with breaking or losing em. Cheap and look good. I have ordered them a few times, kinda disappointed that the lenses this time around arent as dark as they were before, not even close really."
4.0,"This is a terrific dress! The shade of red looks great on me. It is both dressy and sexy. It was just too bad that it wasn‚Äôt available in a 12. I ordered a 10 which  often fits me, but this one did not."
4.0,Bought these for gift bags and the kids loved them.
4.0,I unfortunately have return this item because it doesn‚Äôt fit in the arm areas. It is however a very beautiful item and I‚Äôm sad I have to return it
4.0,Great sweatshirt but it's so large!!! I ordered a men's medium and it fit like a men's large! Be wary when ordering - would suggest getting a size smaller
4.0,Feels a bit heavy but looks good
4.0,Great sturdy glasses.  Cute pouch to carry and clean them with. They are pretty heavy duty so that is a plus also with kids.
4.0,I'm loving this hat! I get tons of compliments on it. It's somewhat large but I have a smallish head. The only problem was that it was a little stinky. I washed and now it's perfect.
4.0,"Bought this for a work dress. A little on the thin side but not sheer. Wouldn't exactly say it works for work without a jacket. Definitely a spandex type of dress but with a jacket or throw it works. Absolutely received compliments and I was very comfy all day. Never lost its form like a traditional tea dress would do. Gave it 4 stars due to as you walk - it will ride up. Nothing serious or embarrassing, but it does a couple of inches. I'm not big on having to constantly pull at my clothing to keep it in place. Yellow is definitely bumble bee transformer - very true in color & size!!"
4.0,Not a bad shirt. It does seem to fit a bit small though but luckily it still fit but was a bit too short. It is very soft and the material is nice
4.0,"Very cute but too small. Size chart was way off.  Deliver late, I was away and could not return so now I am stuck with something I can't use"
4.0,"I really like this top, but it definitely runs small.  I am a us size M-L depending on the brand, but I got the XL and it was still a little snug. The shirt is comfortable and made from good material."
4.0,I do love this dress. I should have ordered a size down. I ordered my usual XL for my bust but was too baggy. I‚Äôm wearing it anyway because it‚Äôs very pretty and comfortable.
4.0,The boots were bought for my daughter and she loves them. They fit her well and she said they are comfortable. Completely happy for the price paid!!!
4.0,"I did not expect this product to come out so great, tip: order a size up"
4.0,It fit good and arecomfortable
4.0,they are what we expected
4.0,"Compliments, and perfect for me"
4.0,I like the hat and the colors and comfort. The only complaint I have is that the eats do not stay standing up.
4.0,I do not like how it is all one piece. But other than that its super cute
4.0,There is a powdery white residue left on your hands and whatever you are polishing. You can dust it off easily but it can be annoying if you are polishing something intricate like a musical instrument.
4.0,Purchased this for my son for his 10th birthday. He LOVES the cubs. The shirt looked great. Cant wait for him to open it.
4.0,The fabric is great. The only thing is that my 4 yr old is not thrilled to wear it. I think she likes the bucket hats. But I am hopeful it will grow on her. I'll test it at the beach this weekend.
4.0,These are absolutely gorgeous and love the extra America strap that can be taken off. Love the cowboy heel and how it rounds up in the front and that it is not a large square toe. The only reason I did not keep is that for $40 more i got real leather cowgirl boots from boot-barn instead. They also sell these at boot-barn for a bit more money so price is good.
4.0,"These dresses run small so although I am normally a medium to large, I ordered extra large and the fit is perfect. I love my dresses"
4.0,"This is made of cheap material, and it is a lot brighter of a blue than what is pictured. However, this is a good piece to just throw in your closet because you can dress it up or dress it down."
4.0,IMO this is g shock s  best looking watch. Stunning charcoal grey band and 12 sided case w cherry ip plating. That said there is no digi part therefore you will not have some of g shocks function. But it is lite and beautiful.
4.0,The backs are  hard to screw into the earring and they are really short to put thru ears.
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; - 112 lbs and bought size small.  Very nice design and comfortable.  Fits perfectly, except was too long, which I expected from the seller and customer reviews, but still wish it was made 3-5 inches shorter so I don't have to run out and get it hemmed.  After using washer and dryer, it  held its shape.  Feels like a soft jersey material."
4.0,"Super cute, fit great"
4.0,The fabric is nice and light. I also like the length. It fits and looks just like picture.
4.0,Its a little thinner than expected but over all very nice. Will be nice for crossfit in florida. Design was cute and seems to be well applied so far.
4.0,"It is really, really, really too expensive for a sweatshirt!!!  BUT.... It's really cute!!  And I love pink and sequins, so I splurged!!  I hope it washes well.  I haven't worn it yet but I really like it!!!  I thought it was cute and kind of classy.  : )  I gave it 4 stars because it is too expensive for a sweatshirt, as I said before."
4.0,I should have bought one longer but that was my fault I miss measured
4.0,"Great fabric, great color. The fit was great on top, but too small at my hips and I don't wear dresses that I have adjust every time I stand up."
4.0,Loved the colors. Fun and well made.
4.0,All the pins received were well made with multiple color combinations and sizes. These will make a nic addition to anyone collecting Disney pins or for a pin collector period.
4.0,Pretty little purse.  Right size for an evening out.  Material had an odor which I will try to eliminate by airing it out for a while.  The purse would have been even nicer if the outside of the purse was made with silk as well as the inside.
4.0,well made; didn't fit; had to return it
4.0,"I really was not sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews... I wanted something light to wear over a sleeveless top.  I did take note of some reviews that said it ran small, so I ordered the next size up.  It fits great (maybe just a tad too big, but I'm glad I got the size up).  It is a very lightweight material, but feels smooth and silky."
4.0,"I mean, I don't think I had ever conceived of such a thing even being a possible occurrence in the world, but apparently my sister-in-law told my wife to buy some random Chinese butt enhancement leggings because of a tik tok, and...she did it.  So hey, I guess marketing strategies are adapting to new channels and whatnot.  But yeah.  My wife is short and she has a big butt.  These pants make her butt look pretty good.  But neither of us has very great confidence in their longevity.  We'll see how they look after a couple of washes and some vigorous workouts.  Really?  Blomgquang tik tok pants?  Reconsider your life choices when it's come to this, man."
4.0,Cute dress but material is clingy and shoes flaws
4.0,"These are boots, with abs.  What's not to like?  My son loves them and shows them off to everyone.  The only issue is that the are clunky, so they can't be worn when he needs to run."
4.0,"Awesome!! I love the sunglasses even though it's a bit bigger of my face .  It came with the hard case, mini crew driver and drawstring case for everyday use . I love this sunglasses. I would recommend the product.. Actually I ordered the gold yellow for my friends birthday as my gift to her. I am sure she will going to love it because I know her taste  when it come in sunglasses. Buy buy buy!!!"
4.0,I Love all the different colors
4.0,Bought this dress for a DIY outfit . Felt a little  bad because the quality of the dress was good for the price.  But I ended up winning the contest  which was great üòÅ
4.0,"First, let me say that I really like this shirt. The material feels nice, and it seems to be well constructed. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 130lbs and a medium fits me perfectly. There are a couple of minor inaccuracies that I need to point out. First, the printing on the sleeves is a darker color fabric than the rest of the shirt. It really stands out, and is not screen accurate. Second, are the rank stripes on the sleeves. this shirt has three stripes of the same with, which again, is not screen accurate. The middle stripe should be narrower than the other two. Having said this, it‚Äôs a good looking shirt, and a great value for the money."
4.0,"Very cute and amazing quality! Does not hang off the shoulders as expected, more of a crew neck, but overall I am very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"Got these for my wife, and she loves them. They do run a bit small though."
4.0,if you have a big wrist might have to use last notch. I used the third from the last
4.0,"Great, sleek design. Thought it would have been a little bigger so I'm rating it a 4/5. Love it regardless ."
4.0,Great sunglasses for someone who is very light sensitive.
4.0,"This is my second time replacing my Garmin Forerunner 25 band. I purchased the watch in June 2016, replaced the strap in August 2017 with the Garmin brand replacement, and just replaced that with this third party strap (Dec 2018).<br /><br />Initial impressions: this band is equivalent in most dimensions to the original article (picture 1) with the exception of being somewhat thicker (pic 2). It installs easily with the included screwdrivers, but does not include the screw hardware, so if you've lost or bent those pieces you should consider another option. The last pic is actually the old band that is being replaced, to demonstrate the typical wear pattern.<br /><br />I wear this watch 24/7, and the previous bands have each lasted about 15 months of running, biking, and field work. If this band lasts that long I will consider it a success."
4.0,"I ordered this top in a large. I am pear shaped, size 14/16. The fit was great. However, the shirt reeked of cigarette smoke. I'm not sure if the designer was smoking while stitching, if maybe someone had smoked and then returned it, but it smelled awful. Outside of the smell, I was very happy with the blouse."
4.0,The dress fit true to size.  I am 5'8 and 180lbs.  But the knee length was off.  I went by the picture but unfortunately in person it was shorter then seen on amazon.  I was disappointed that I had to return in but it wouldn't fit for the occasion I needed it for.
4.0,They serve their purpose well and are cute. They don't squeeze my head like most bands but they stay in place.
4.0,Fits well and very quick delivery and they should design it with a modern slim fit design it's a little baggy below the chest
4.0,"this watch is great for the price its made very well, it doesn't seem to break easily and it looks very cool not very hard to set ether, but sometimes its hard to read in daylight, and it takes you a while to read the time sometimes"
4.0,"I really like this band. It seems to be good quality. It's nice and substantial. I got it to replace the leather band that came with a stainless steel watch. The bands that come with watches never fit my wrists. To give you an idea of size, the original leather band would barely fit on the last hole, but was too tight to wear. This fits nice...maybe even a little loose, but I like it. I haven't needed to size it because I have large wrists, but it seems like it wouldn't be too hard for a careful, handy person with a dremel. Otherwise I'm sure a local jeweler would be able to take care of the sizing. I have no reason to think it won't last as long as the watch I put it on."
4.0,"Looks good on screen. Robust and well designed. Delivery was as promised. Everything I have bought through Mil-Tec has been outstanding so far. Two y things would improve this product: 1) change the dark green molle, so it blends instead of stark contrast and defeats the camo, 2) add is a way to stow the strap and maintain the waterproof seal.<br />If fits my tripod with PIG saddle and other gear. It can be strapped to another small pack (left side from rifle) to organize and lighten loads. The zippered side pouches are handy for soft gear, cleaning rod, etc for easy access."
4.0,Not a flattering fabric and proportions were weird the waist was a bit baggy but I got what I paid for
4.0,nice colors and warms
4.0,"Very nice, but very heavy!"
4.0,"ZHENHUA Women's Summer Jumpsuit Casual V-Neck Sleeveless Wide Leg Pants Jumpsuit Rompers with Pockets<br />Size Small - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The small fits but I think a medium would have given me that little bit more room I feel more comfortable wearing.<br /><br />The jumpsuit is very comfortable. There is a snap at the chest to keep the front closed. The front is a bit low cut, this might be a problem for women with larger chests. The length is a few inches above the ankles. There is elastic at the waistline but it is not a tight elastic. Super cute - perfect to put on during those hot summer days after a day in the pool. Non-binding. Nice outfit that can be dressed up or to wear casually at home! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,nice fit and quality seems good I wish you made this color in a grayer lens looking out.
4.0,"Love this trendy top. Got it in about 8 days and i was expecting this to take about 4 wks to reach me since this seller is in China. So was super happy with the quick post.<br />1 am 170lbs and 5ft 6inch and got the large black...it fit well, but it was maybe half a size smaller than a regular US size L.<br />The top looks amazing. The top length at the back is about 2 inch longer than the front, so it looks super with tights/jeans and even skirts. The lazer cut out is eye catching and in vogue now. The only reason i give this a 4 rating is because i am afraid of the material....worried it may fray at the lattice edges when washed. The recommended wash instructions state 'dry clean' is required. A couple of my girlfriends complimented me immediately on seeing this top...so overall happy with this item, price and shipping time. I went ahead and ordered 2 additional tops in different colors."
4.0,"Nice swim skort, but will purchase one size up the next time I order."
4.0,This a a pretty off shoulder top. If you want ti to flare at the bottom I suggest ordering one size up.
4.0,"These night vision glasses would have been perfect except for the nose ""clips"".  They made the glasses very uncomfortable for me and I had to return because of them."
4.0,"This dress is roomy & comfortable. I'm almost 5'4&#34; & 135lbs (36D on top), I bought the L & it hits about an inch or so above my knees- I could definitely wear this in summer without leggings but it also looks great with leggings for cooler seasons. The top is roomy, sleeves appropriate length. The V neck definitely plunged too low, but I sewed it up to a length I'm comfortable with. The fabric is not see-through, at least not in the red, navy or black colors (definitely navy blue, not the bluish-teal shown in pics). Cute little dress."
4.0,"I don't recommend this top to full figured women.  Before ordering this item, I'd read in the reviews that they run small, so I ordered an XXL thinking that would be big enough, but it wasn't, and I could tell it wouldn't be as soon as I pulled it out of the bag.  I doubt an XXXL would be much better.  I also expected the material to be softer, and it *is* soft, but it has a scratchy texture I've never much cared for personally.  My only redeeming grace with this is that my friend/room mate likes it, so I gave it to her instead of returning it.  Also, the blue colored top is a very pretty blue, which makes me all the sadder that this isn't something I can wear.<br /><br />Edit:  I upgraded my rating to 4 stars after receiving a message from friendly staff offering to do whatever necessary to make my experience right.  Thanks guys!  :)"
4.0,"This is a beautiful rosary. My only criticism is that the crucifix needs to be attached more firmly or as firmly as the rest of the rosary, As is the crucifix will most likely come off after a trip in the dryer. Just a little  structural reinforcement would work wonders here. highly recommended , though !"
4.0,Like.<br />What expected
4.0,It‚Äôs really large
4.0,Love this bracelet- very pretty
4.0,"I like it it fit good the color as show on the picture,thanks."
4.0,Love there boots! I‚Äôd recommend getting them one size up. I normally wear an 11 and got a 12 and they fit great! Also I would wear higher cut socks with then if you plan on wearing them for a prolong period of time as at the heel the leather bunches and rubs.
4.0,"Quality, fit, workmanship and materials seemed very good.  The price was acceptable for quality of the garment.  It's going on a trip to the east coast for a few days in the sun ..."
4.0,Very roomy I order a large .
4.0,"These are very comfortable. I mean, come on, they're pajamas with pockets pretty much. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because they are very long on me and are a little too tight on my calfs. A slim boot cut, I prefer traditional boot cut. I have very muscle legs so I need the extra room. Oh and to keep them on it has a draw string. It takes a little getting use to."
4.0,"A little thin, but that's to be expected I guess. Nice if you fold in the inside lapels."
4.0,Very good fits perfect
4.0,Price was great and the cross is beautiful.  for the price I probably would expect it to not last forever but I got my moneys worth and then some.  Order flow was great and the supplier was smart enough to send in an envelope via US mail instead of UPS or Fed-X.  Save $$$ wherever you can.
4.0,"I bought these for my boys (ages 5 and 9). They work pretty well, but the onion fumes still get into their eyes. I like the attachment to secure behind their ears. This helps with fitting both boys appropriately."
4.0,Well-made for price
4.0,"Very good value for 2 Nato bands. The straps have stitched guide rings which is a must for these straps. The leather strap is adequate, but not that great looking. You are better off choosing a pair of canvas straps and just order a leather strap from somewhere else if that's what you like. Otherwise this is a no brainier for value. The red/white/blue strap looks great on my Seiko Diver."
4.0,Very nice dress. Fits just as how it looks. Good quality material and texture. I'm 5&#34;4 160 lbs and bought a large. Perfect dress
4.0,My daughter loves it! Very cozy and soft once washed.
4.0,I purchased in 2X in gray and paired with a pink cardigan. I suggest a body smoother.
4.0,"This is such a beautiful cover! The colors are not as vibrant as in the picture, but it's a gorgeous pattern. It fits very well. I'm 5'4&#34; and it's a perfect length. Not amazing quality, but good. Definitely happy with this purchase!"
4.0,About right
4.0,"I find that finding a romper that fits correctly is pretty rare. This one totally works for my body! I love how you have options of how you want to do the straps in the back. The material is light and airy, and you can‚Äôt see nude undergarments underneath. My only beef is that both of the buttons for the straps came off the first time I washed it (on delicate), and the washer ate one of them. Had to do quite the search for 1/4 in buttons of the same nature, and re-learn how to sew a button (thought of hitting up Hurly for buttons but get that would take too long). It was easy enough, and I have a feeling they they‚Äôll stay on longer than one wash. You may want to wash this in a laundry bag, so if the buttons to come off, all you need is a needle and thread (and perhaps YouTube)."
4.0,"We bought these as a Birthday gift for a friend, and she really likes them! Subtle but cute."
4.0,"Product as described.  This cardigan fits well, however, it is short.  I layer it with tanks in different colors for contracts.  but if you are looking for a natural fit, this is not the product for you."
4.0,I REALLY love this bathing suit. If fits well. I got the 10-12 and I'm a 36 DD bust size 10 pants. It hides my Mom pouch. Only downfall is it smelled really bad like smoke when I got it. Hoping the wash takes it out.
4.0,"Skirt is very nice and well made for the price.  Satin material is nice and not too shiny or cheap looking.  The black skirt does have a white zipper and I think the skirt could use a sash to cover the elastic in the back. Nice length I'm 5'5 and it just touches the floor with no shoes when worn high waisted. Runs a little big, especially if you have an hourglass shape.  I'm exchanging for a smaller size."
4.0,"Wings do fit a bit snug, but they're amazing. Love the piercings and not uncomfortable to wear on a daily basis."
4.0,The chain is super thin and cheap for the price.
4.0,Perfect costume to wear while looking through people‚Äôs living room windows.
4.0,"In terms of softness and warmth, these were better than expected. The fit was perfect and even had some extra stretch (which I think is nice). The price was a bit much but I'd probably buy another pair if they had a cable knit version."
4.0,The gloves look nice. But I have to return them and get the next size bigger.
4.0,The fabric is very good quality. But my mistake was taking a size larger than mine. I should have taken one lesser instead. But nice dress. Like in the picture
4.0,I really like the close in front construction and the snaps are nice and tight. I also find the old school basic white color a plus. There's a one star detraction because the seams of the cup show through with clingy tops.
4.0,It's flattering to my figure (pear shape) and really soft. I like that the sleeves are very long and that it's washable.
4.0,Cute dress needed an extra small
4.0,"This cute little vintage clutch is made of super soft leather.  I love the zipper pocket on the bottom.  It is perfect for your cards.  The clutch is two sided.  My iphone 5 fits perfectly on one side.  (The iphone 6 does not fit.  It is too big.)  On the other side there is just enough room for keys, lipstick, and a small mirror.  It's adorable.  Mine is a little asymmetric...  But, it's not enough to seriously stir my OCD need for perfect symmetry. üòä"
4.0,Very nice like the color like how it feels feel like I should have came with the watch
4.0,"This bracelet watchband is solid!  I have a large diameter wrist, ( 7 inches ) and initially when putting this on my watch, it dug into my flesh and was extremely uncomfortable.  I could never wear it like this.  I tried to open the curve with my bare hands but the metal wasn't budging.  I really liked it in every other way so I gambled with a towel and a hammer.<br />  I wrapped the metal ( take your watch off of it first!!)  in a couple layers of toweling , braced it on a flat surface with the curve up, and hit it a few times with the hammer on the curve.  It straightened out beautifully.  Maybe a little too straight.  One too many hits I think with that hammer.  On the other side, I didn't hammer as hard or as many- maybe 3 hits, and it was perfect.  I needed to go back to the first side, and make it a little more curved to match my second attempt.  I put it on the skinny end and hit the wider end that was up in the air to make it smaller or curvier.  Now it fits perfectly.  I love it and it is now very comfortable.  If you get this band and it is too small to fit around your wrist, it can be made bigger!"
4.0,Very beautiful. Just as pictured. I just wish it was longer. I love the kimono sleeves! Just beautiful!
4.0,Nice sweater - good quality but needing next size up so will give this to friend ...
4.0,"Very warm and comfortable, front pouch is sort of shallow."
4.0,WORKED AS NEEDED. WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THEY CAME IN A CONTAINER
4.0,Good fit for my glasses after measuring and translating mm to inches .<br />It tuck a wile but it was worth it  many sizes are available  Have not used them yet .
4.0,"I like how real it looks!!<br />However, I noticed an industrial smell when I opened the package. BUT after washing in how water and Dawn Powerwash, the smell is gone.<br />It‚Äôs a bit difficult to wear, but I‚Äôm experimenting with elastics or even gluing a black mask underneath to help.<br />Overall, it‚Äôs pretty neat. Great quality, sturdy, and very, very realistic. The teeth are even sharp! Perfect for Halloween/creating a costume"
4.0,They are beautiful. Great for the money. I would suggest having the clasp and rings it attaches to soldered.
4.0,I'm 5'8&#34; and 180lbs- I wear a 14 jean and a 38DD. I bought the 2x because I wanted it to fit my bust and didn't want it to be too tight under the arms. Got my wish but there's about 6 inches of extra material around my ribs and the overall effect is a swing rather than fit and flare.<br />Construction is decent and the cut is cute. Fabric is sturdy with a huge amount of stretch. Should have bought smaller.<br />Handy with a sewing machine so I'll nip some darts into it.
4.0,"I do wish they would attach to mask that are not pleated. Other than that they work great even in non pleated mask, just have to hold then in place while putting on mask, but they stay in place. And they also help with the mask that are to big. No more inhaling the mask."
4.0,These are a very thin material. I am a small with a 34B. They are quite a bit smaller than what I expected but still look good. The shape looks exactly like the photo. A few fraying strings here and there but definitely worth the money.
4.0,"I loved the colors!  Great products.  However, a couple of them were a bit too small for me and gave me a serious headache.  But overall, I love them!"
4.0,good deals
4.0,Nice earrings but were too heavy and large for the person they were intended for.  I ended up returning them.
4.0,"The gloves overall were pretty okay. They did for a bit larger than expected, but were excellent at keeping my fingers nice and toasty on my evening winter runs! The only complaint is that the gloves touch screen ability worked sometimes. I think because the fingers are slightly ill fitted it makes the touch screen feature more difficult, but certainly not impossible. For a $8-9 dollar pair of gloves the quality is nice and I would purchase again."
4.0,"Turtlenecks are probably one of the most difficult pieces of clothing to describe in order to make the reader understand, about as personal as shoe sizing. That said, in my opinion they did a real nice job on the overall cut. And to my delight, somewhat longer than an average Tee. They hang nice, and between the cut and the fact that they're black they do a great job of helping to conceal my lovely middle-age paunch (ick). Not too boxy, not too tight. I bought one - and two more after receiving it. The fabric does a great job of holding it's shape, even after wearing it a few times (the material just feels better with each wash). Personally love it. LOTS of compliments. üòä"
4.0,"I received the sneakers, tried them on and they felt great, perfect size and all that, however the red part was just a bit lighter than I expected from the pictures, not pink, but a little to light red for my liking, Did an extremely easy return and ordered a different color."
4.0,"The pants are expandable but not adjustable, nor can you wear a belt. They are also a little on light side for the winter. However!  Adequate for a fun outfit."
4.0,great for holding phone and other small items when traveling.
4.0,"Great bag to use everyday! Wish it was a tad larger, but still works great for throwing a few kids things in with my own."
4.0,As described and delivered as stated.
4.0,I like it but its cheap fabric
4.0,Comfortable waist; not too tight or too loose.  Length a touch longer than I like but not a significant issue.
4.0,"This is a pretty fun accessory to have for parties or futuristic cosplays, etc.  It's easy to see through while worn, and the light doesn't inhibit vision at all, though it might take some getting used to at first.<br />Lights on each side are controlled individually.  There's a single button that cycles through colors and modes on each side of the visor.<br />I am however a little bit disappointed that there's no way to choose a specific color through either RGB or a gradient,  as the color I wanted for mine would have been a shade of orange, which isn't one of the presets.  This can somewhat be worked around though by choosing a different color on each side to get the desired color mix in the middle.  i.e. red on one side and yellow on the other to get an overall orange shade.  I also kind of wish there was a way to power it on and have it jump directly to the last mode used instead of needing to cycle through all colors and modes to get to what you want.<br />It's also worth noting that the fit is fairly snug.  It's able to flex a little bit to fit different head sizes, but trying to flex it too much may cause it to crack, so I wouldn't recommend trying to fit it over a mask or a fursuit head or anything else that would increase the width of your head.<br />Overall a pretty neat product!  Not perfect, but still fun."
4.0,They lasted for awhile
4.0,"These gloves are just what I need for barn work to keep my hands warm.  I ordered a medium which is big on my hands.  They're manageable, but awkward."
4.0,"Decent band, if not a bit heavy.  Feels about twice as heavy as the watch itself.  Might be a plus for some.  But is definitely a quality product.  Fits my large wrist and looks good with my Apple Watch Sport.<br /><br />REVISED:  I've come to like the weight and the band does look very nice with the watch.  The brushed finish is close to the aluminum sport."
4.0,These skirts are comfortable and easy to get on and off and look very decent.  I've laundered them several times in cool water in my washing machine-they came out great- need no ironing. Sizing? purchased two. the  medium fit fine the next medium was too small. Returned it and bought a large and that fit well.
4.0,"the shirt is well made, soft material, very pretty colors, I ordered 3X after reading reviews saying it ran small, I wear 2X. It was still a bit snug on me but I'm a<br /> 40 DD, so I gave it to my mom, she's a 1 X and it fit her well"
4.0,"Good quality, solid zipper"
4.0,Cute shoes but even though is 0-6 month I recommend for 4-6 months old baby it's big
4.0,"but I expected more ""opal""...."
4.0,Beautiful on. I get lots of compliments. Adds a bit of color to any outfit
4.0,Nice work wear.
4.0,It's a very comfortable top.  i get a lot of compliments when wearing it.
4.0,Looks nice and keeps hands warm
4.0,Very pretty. I listened to the other reviews and ordered a large. For reference I am a 5'9&#34; and size 4-6 and was about to order the small!<br />The large fit well and hangs nicely. Order up a size or two!!
4.0,"Quite big on my female wrist, although perfectly intact and amazing"
4.0,"This is such a cute and comfy PJ set. I'm typically between a small and medium and went with the medium so it wouldn't be tight, and the fit is perfect. The bottoms are high waisted, which is the only thing I don't like about this set. They're loose enough that I can just roll the waistband down, but just an FYI. Otherwise, I love these cute PJs and would definitely recommend them."
4.0,"The sweatpants are nice and I like the color. However, the waistband is thick and it stays tight. I prefer a waistband that‚Äôs more supple so it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs digging into your skin especially when you sit."
4.0,It is what I figured it would be. It feels good to wear. I wear them when riding my bike during bright sunshine.
4.0,"It is a very nice band, but after a couple of days it stopped staying on and would attach to clothing and come undone and had to change to a different band."
4.0,Great hat but small. Looks like it for kids or people with small heads
4.0,Fits good just a little flare at the bottom.
4.0,"I like the button fly, not as soft as I would like but comfortable just the same. I wear size 34 waist, I ordered the medium which fit fine , but I wish I had ordered large , I just wear them around the house so baggy loose fit would have been better for me"
4.0,Love this chain!  Multi-use necklace to wear with multiple items!  Simple and Elegant at the same time!
4.0,"I love these belly rings, super cute, affordable. They look as pictured... HOWEVER not all of them are made with stainless steel, let alone any type of metal. The only reason I know is because my fiance and I like to metal detect. When you dig a hole for detecting you need to use a pin pointer to find what caused your detector to go off. Well my fiance used his pinpointer on my belly button to make a joke and we realized the pin pointer wouldnt go off like it should when you put it near anything metal. We tested the pointer on other metal things (it worked) the and back to my belly ring and again it wouldnt go off. So if you're okay with some of the jewelry (possibly all) being plastic then honestly they do hold up very well! I've head no issues with them at all over the past 2months."
4.0,"Works nicely quickly separating gold from gravel. It does require a different technique from using a regular pan, due to the pocket in the bottom of the pan. I was quite happy with the results when I tested it doing some garage panning. Looking forward to getting into the field with this pan and really putting it to the test."
4.0,"Jacket fit OK with out the armor, but the body armor is kind of messed up and makes the jacket fit kind of crappy!!!"
4.0,Super cute but fragile.  I purchased this for my teenage daughter and she broke it the first time she put it on.
4.0,"I got mine last night, and it arrived about a week before expected in great condition. Chain is pretty sturdy, and overall it looks great! More dark yellow than pictured, and the rose is slightly off center, but only noticeable if you look very closely. Paid only 1.50 for it though, so I love it, it's a great value."
4.0,"Beautiful, a clever design integrating wood elements with the metal."
4.0,"These look just like the picture.  But, they are pretty heavy so may be difficult to wear for an extended period of time."
4.0,It was made very well and the color was nice. I was it fit a little bit looser.
4.0,Pretty good quality!
4.0,Lovely gloves. Not very thick or water resistant but very cute.
4.0,Fit great and cute for the price
4.0,Good quality shirt!!
4.0,"I was reading some of the other reviews for this trench coat and saw that some people said this coat didn't have pockets.  It DOES have pockets, they are just sewn shut like any regular suit would be.  You have to take seam rippers to them to open them and then the pockets are actually quite deep.  This is a fairly normal practice for this type of clothing, and it gives you the choice to leave them closed or if you want them open.<br /><br />As for the coat itself, it is actually kind of nice, the material feels nice and waterproof to protect your suit if your in the rain.  It is also pretty lightweight, so I'm not sure how it will do in the winter but at least for the spring, summer and fall months, this will probably be enough in the Midwest weather if you don't want to get your suit wet in the rain.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it is dry clean only, and you can't iron it.  it kind of stinks but it is what it is.  it wouldn't be a terrible deal but it shipped pretty wrinkled so I'll have to find a way to straighten this out without ironing it, which is why I bumped it down 1 star to 4."
4.0,"I have bought this dress in two different colors.  Although the quality is great, the blue color runs smaller than the others."
4.0,"I'm very happy with this purchase, I found them true to size.  I'm in between 7.5-8, I bought 7.5.  So when they stretched, they would be a perfect fit. I wanted a thinner band, I have no problems wearing them when I workout with barbells or dumbbells.  Black/Grey/White was an easy choice, may buy other color sets in the future."
4.0,"Very nice quality, but it runs very very small! Had to return because it was too tight."
4.0,"I work in a sensitive electronics area. I am required to be grounded at all times and I have the stupid heel straps and I'm not spending a ton of money on specific shoes. I figured I'd give these a try, and they work perfectly every time. I've had them for about a month now, have them checked at a station every day and they always pass. I only give it a 4 because while the adhesive itself is good, there is some very light fraying at the edges of the actual strap itself where over time (many months, at this rate) it may end up tearing. Not to be unexpected though as it literally is on the bottom of your shoe."
4.0,I bought these shoes for my granddaughter's birthday because she picked them out. The first pair was returned because the 7/12 was too small. So we ordered the size 8 and she wore them to soccer practice and found the shoes to be very comfortable with a first time wearing through her whole practice. She thanked me again and said she loves her new shoes!üòç
4.0,I bought this for my best friend and she loves it ... but the shipping took a super long time.
4.0,"These are beautiful pants! I was super excited taking them out of the packaging,  but sadly they are wayyyyy to small. I ordered a xxl but could hardly pull them past my legs. They seem more like a M-L in actuality. Bummed they dont make a larger version or i would exchange in a minute. Sadly have to return them. :("
4.0,"I was looking for the same options in gold, no go."
4.0,My wife loves them. Would like to see different styles of earrings with the Decepticon emblem.
4.0,"I love this pendant, it shines just the right amount and doesn‚Äôt take away from the rest of your attire. Definitely has a party feel to it. I was sad that it didn‚Äôt come with any certificate that I am used to getting with my other moissanite purchases. Nevertheless, it holds up. The chain is of ok quality but has a sufficient length that can be adjusted. One negative, I am not a fan of the locking system, it‚Äôs a bit fiddly and I always need some extra help in locking and unlocking."
4.0,Beautiful bag for the money.  Too dark for my needs.
4.0,"Very cute shirt!  The reviews said to by a size or two up, I would have bought my size (largerl normally).  It fits a little big when you size up, overall I'm happy with the purchase and hope it shrinks a little bit after i wash and dry it."
4.0,"These are lighter and kinda cheap feeling, but you get what you pay for, and they worked good for tapering."
4.0,I had to stretch this cuff out a bit since it was a little tight. Now I love it. So far so good after multiple wears.
4.0,They are cute but runs small. I'm happy it barely fit my kid so size up recommended
4.0,"nice color, as pictured"
4.0,These do the job. I have had them slip a few times but I have small arms so I am not surprised. I am sure they would work fine on most people.<br /> I ordered these in silver. I received black and contacted the seller. They sent the correct color.
4.0,"Fit was a little big order 1 size down if you get this shirt, that's why I gave it only 4 stars. Color and materials are very good."
4.0,"Nice, a little bigger than I wanted !"
4.0,Cute and lightweight but to big ~ kept it anyway
4.0,These are really sweet. The fabric is a little thinner than I thought it would be.
4.0,"A few of them already broke.. they're very fragile.. but really cute. There are enough of them that I still have several left. I like the ones for the pinky.  The gold starts fading after a little while.  But hey, they were a few dollars. It's not like I'm gonna be on the red carpet with people asking me who designed my ring and how much it cost...;-)  They're so cute, I'd order them again."
4.0,I used this hair clip for Easter instead of a hat. My hair is natural and it must be pressed in order to wear a hat. I usually wear my hair in a braided updo so this clip gave me a little pizazz without having to get a silk press.
4.0,The butterfly print is great. My granddaughter loves the fit.
4.0,"I bought these for ten friends - parents of graduating high school students. The venue had a clear bag policy. It made it possible to carry keys, wallets, phones, etc without carrying a ziplock. Reasonably priced. Perfect for what they were needed for at a super price. Personally, I would never use it for other than this type of event - concert, game, etc - but they worked well for this."
4.0,This is a lovely pc
4.0,Good shoes. My feet stayed dry when worn in the rain.
4.0,"What I paid for,"
4.0,It's stretchy and purchase a small and it fit like a big medium. great quality.
4.0,"It's a little shorter than I expected and it needs more ironing than I'd hoped for.  I'm a size 18 for reference, and it was just a bit tight at the hips.  But it's a great item for the price."
4.0,it's a nice shirt. Designed to be worn untucked. The fit is somewhat roomy. The only gripe is I wish Lands' End offered a tailored fit option. It seems they're phasing that out however.
4.0,"It's a very nice prosuct. It runs a little tight, but it's doable."
4.0,"Love it! Comfortable, well made. Pants in the M where very long (I'm 5'4) but Hemmed up nicely"
4.0,"Arrived quickly. Very pretty. Beads are color exactly as pictured, but cross is silver, not gold. I was expecting silver after reading the other reviews.  One of the beads is not connected straight, but it does not take away from how pretty it is. I am happy with it, especially for the price. It's not super delicate, but I'm still going to be gentle with it. I am very pleased."
4.0,"(Daughter)<br />This swimsuit is very cute and modest! I ordered a small and it fit comfortably for the most part. I will warn you that it does not have adjustable straps in the top, so I had to adjust them by sewing them. It is a two piece, and I have a smaller figure so the top is a little loose. If you have a long torso it will not cover your stomach all the way. Definitely recommend getting though!"
4.0,I love Pajama Jeans!
4.0,The material is definitely a bit scratchy but they are very good for their purpose. The pockets are a god send. They will ride high up and get under your knee but I haven't had any issues at all.
4.0,"Quality and design could be better, but overall a great value."
4.0,Wow what can I say! This is a very sexy mini Night Club dress with a one size fits all because of the stretching PU leather that it's made from.<br /><br /> The medium size usually fits a normal person has about 5 5 and 120 pounds with a bust size of 35. I am 5/6 and 128 pounds and my breasts are a  38 and it fit me.<br /><br /> The dress is absolutely beautiful with shiny blue. I was very impressed and I thought the quality was pretty good. It's thinner material  than I thought but it definitely is much shinier than I thought and it looks beautiful with black heels.<br /><br /> I've worn it twice now. I wore out with my girlfriends with black heels and black nylons and I looked amazing and then I went on a date with my husband and wore it  with black leggings and a little black sweater over it and it was absolutely adorable.<br /><br />So it's kind of versatile.... you can wear it as a dress or kind of is a halter top with a nice little sweater assemble over it. The material is thin yet you can't see through it but not thin enough neither will tear easily.<br /><br />What I like about it is that at the material is stretchy so after night of eating and drinking you have a little room to move in!.<br /><br />When I had it on with my leggings and my little black sweater assemble I got several several compliments about how well and how cute the outfit it was.<br /><br /> When I first took it out of the package I didn't think it was going to be as cute or pretty until once you got it on. Once I put it on and accessorize it with everything it made an absolutely beautiful outfit. So I can say that without a doubt this dress did exceed my expectations and the fact that I could wear it two different ways and it look nice both ways and it fit me perfect.<br /><br />When I wear this dress I had no problem with it trying to creep up in the back over my butt or sliding down over my breasts. The dress stayed up where it was supposed to and stayed down where  it was supposed to...<br /><br /> I am going to be posting pictures when this review goes live so that you can see how nice it looks on.<br /><br />Disclaimer I was offered this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review for which I have given
4.0,excellent buy
4.0,"I bought a size medium, which was a mistake. I am 5'5&#34;, 147, and a D. I should have bought a large to cover more side boob. But other than that great buy, the size everywhere else works."
4.0,"I doubt it offers much protection, but it is cute. Its small, probably more suited for ages 13 and younger."
4.0,It fits pretty good. I have face of 6‚Äô3‚Äù 210 lb man.<br /><br />It could be better. It would be more convenient if the design gave one side of the gaiter some form of curvature for there to be a front side of the mask just so that when you pull it over your nose you don‚Äôt have to constantly pull it back down to get it out of your eyes.
4.0,Just right for my needs
4.0,The trick to this pill box is to put your pills in the lid and then  close the pill box. This way you can fit more pills and they will not crush because of how the lid fits to the bottom. All seven of my pills fit in this compact pill box. I like it so much that I bought  two more as gifts. E.
4.0,"I gave four stars,because of the way it fits. I normally wear a size M, but I got a large .<br />The fabric is soft and good quality."
4.0,I'm size 7 in shoes and shoes are a little too big but they are comfortable and I'm able to wear them all day at work
4.0,"very long<br />wrap opens when wearing, some kind of closure has to be added<br />lovely fabric"
4.0,it fits great. has rubber on the colar of the dress so the sleeves stay on the shoulders.
4.0,I would have preferred the pockets for the phone to be place near to my chest. all of the pocket are around the waist.
4.0,I wish it had a strap to keep it on my head because of the wind... love this hat
4.0,Very good every day Watchmen.
4.0,No problems with them!  Have only used twice so far but seem to be good quality!  Plan to keep and use!
4.0,These eyebrow rings are awesome and the best part was the price. They're shorter than my original barbell so I just changed the ends off to have a different look everyday.
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit, but it needed better lining in the top white part. You could see the padding‚Äôs for the boobs. Not good for swim just lounging"
4.0,"Very comfortable. Only problem is buckle doesn't quite lay flat, the more I wear it though I bet it will"
4.0,These have ear loops which is nice and the material fully covers your nose and mouth.  The material is lightweight and breathable but for me the gaiter was a little too snug.  I do have a big head so perhaps they are more suited for smaller faces.
4.0,"I've been wearing this band for a little over a week now and I'm liking it!  I was very worried that it would be too loose and slide around all day, but it's just tight enough that is doesn't slip off my hand and also doesn't cut the circulation off in my hand.  I did have to cut of the passcode to my watch b/c when it does slide around, the watch will lock and you have to put in your code every. single. time. The sensor is not affected by this, but you can't use apple pay with the code off. I have only used apple pay on my watch once, so it's not a big deal to me. All in all, I love the band and will start buying more of these bracelet style bands."
4.0,Love the design.  It fits like a normal tank. I wish I was more fitted.
4.0,Good fabric for the price
4.0,I also wear it during the day. I;m counting on the lens have uvb and ova protection.
4.0,I love these! It's cool that they are hand made but the bracelets strings really stick out otherwise I really like them!
4.0,surpricingly nice !!
4.0,As described.  But they seem to thin to do anything with.
4.0,I really like this sweater and the fact that it‚Äôs made from recycled materials (polyester). It‚Äôs really soft & comfortable. The weather here has held on for a while so I can‚Äôt really talk about how warm it is yet.<br /><br /> Sleeves are almost always long on me and this was no exception. One fold & I was good to go.<br /><br />This will look great with a variety of shirts and boots.
4.0,"It fit as expected, I was worried it would run small as so many do, and was pleased hat this suit fit true.  The tank top that is suppose to hang over it looks more like a bib, sewed on.  But for the price, the look and fit wern't bad."
4.0,Great value. Has held up well.  It does run on the small side.
4.0,"I ordered this and the navy version from another shop (AsherFashion), and found them both to be as pictured, very cute and warm. The navy one, however, was several inches shorter than the cream one, and both capes kept folding up at the bottom where the fur part is. I also wasn't a fan of how bulky the hood is, but thats a common problem with sweatshirts and other hooded clothes. Overall this is a cute cape and I recommend it, just wasn't for me<br />(This is a review for the thick cream bunny cape)"
4.0,This jacket is much warmer than I thought it would be - a plus for me. It's really cozy and stylish. Fits pretty much to size. Go up a size if you want an oversized fit.
4.0,"I love this maxi dress! I got it in black. Very comfortable, easy to dress up. I gave 4 stars because its a tad bit see through. Im 5'7, 160lbs, 38 DDD and the Medium fit perfect."
4.0,En la descripci√≥n no indica que tiene dise√±o en la espalda y si lo tiene por eso no me gusto no uso con dise√±o en la espalda
4.0,Girlfriend loved it. Cooler brand stamp than nike
4.0,"I bought this bag as a cheaper alternative to buying a suitcase. It‚Äôs a fantastic lightweight bag, perfect for travelers who are on the run and go. My only disappointment with this bag is I can‚Äôt zip it bag to the smaller size and the shoulder strap it comes with has zero padding and makes it a little less comfortable to travel with. Aside from that, it‚Äôs totally worth the $20 you spend on it!"
4.0,These arrived on time with no problems. Very comfortable . Will buy more in the future
4.0,Mailed out well. It works. Has a second hand. Good image. Thin metal hence the 4 stars but made well enough. Don't think it should be worn often.
4.0,Love the boot just feel the boot is tighter than other boots I own. I wear an eleven and they are snug and not really tie to size. That is the only reason  I gave It a 4. Otherwise . Great price and nice look.
4.0,I WORE THIS TOP YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 70 DEGREES OUTSIDE.  IT WAS STILL COMFORTABLE.  I ALSO LIKE THE FLOWERS ETC ON IT.  I HAVENT WASHED IT YET SO I DONT KNOW HOW THAT WILL COME OUT.  I EXPECT IT TO BE JUST FINE.
4.0,It‚Äôs fine but wish you could choose what picks come with it
4.0,I will say that I have ordered better quality for 30 dollars more but I needed this fast. The quality is to be expected from Amazon. I got it in a large and the black bodysuit  was stretchy so I was thankful for that. The white sleeve part is a bit tight on my shoulders though. The blue really big on me and the gloves didn‚Äôt fit. Overall it‚Äôs okay. It gets the job done for recording TikToks but I probably wouldn‚Äôt wear it for a convention.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, arrived quickly and well-packed. Prettier in person.Great price. Be aware that in order to get the fullness in the skirt show in pics, you will need to purchase a petticoat thing. Otherwise, poof is minimal."
4.0,"The Harrington is a must have.  This particular jacket is a great Bargain.  it is very well made.  The fabric, sewing and liner are all top shelf.  The only thing I wish it had was an inside pocket."
4.0,Love it!! Runs a bit large tho. I had to made it Fixed.
4.0,Great umbrella - the wind flaps come in handy and prevent breaking from gusts of wind.<br /><br />I would hardly classify it as a large umbrella though. It‚Äôs more of a standard size.
4.0,"The dress fits about average for Petite sizing, hitting slightly above the knee. The only negative for me was the material; I was looking for something in cotton."
4.0,Zumba class<br />Fits and feels as expected<br />Will order additional pairs<br />Love ur designs!
4.0,"Great top, as usual.  The colors are ten times more intense than the illustration (at least, as they appear on my computer), so if you like intense color--oranges and blues--this top is for you."
4.0,These earrings look great. I just hope they are 14K white gold as advertised.
4.0,"Got exactly what was pictured, so really happy about that. Only reason I took a star off is because the bars are a little bit too short; not to the point of discomfort though."
4.0,I still like it
4.0,It's cute if I would change something I wish it were cotton since it is so hot and humid here
4.0,"LOVE the necklace, but got was supposed to be here for an event I needed to attend and my package was A DAY LATE."
4.0,I ordered it in a rush. Did not quite check the sizes so it could‚Äôve been my fault but my kid love the jacket so I‚Äôll give it four stars could‚Äôve been five if I would have to check the sizes. The jacket holds up she‚Äôs a rough kids  and a jacket has not been torn out
4.0,Wonderful!! It helps with my driving a lot during the day!!
4.0,Good price and fit
4.0,"Fit is a little off, but I have been looking for these for a long time."
4.0,"This wallet is cute, It was delivered 2 weeks earlier than it was supposed to come, its big and there is room for cards money and a section for change with a zipper, however I advise being careful with some of the slots for the cards because some are deep and its easy to let your card slip right in, but overall I recommend this wallet!"
4.0,"Love the design, the material is hot and the fit is a little tighter than I expected.  I would size up."
4.0,"I like the product, dislike the packaging the silica gel packet inside opening during delivery left some stains"
4.0,"They are just a tad too dark for my liking, but they really cut down the glare from oncoming headlights! I would certainly recommend them to friends that drive a lot at night."
4.0,"These are a bit shorter than I'd like, but otherwise  they're cute and fit pretty well under my boots. They can only be worn with the grey side up (they're tighter at one end) but they look fine that way."
4.0,"The inner barbell is 1.5"", the overall is nearly 2"", so the barbell was too long for me, but the charms are cute.<br />I put them on a smaller barbell. The elephant is the largest, and really a little too large for my little ears, but they're still darn cute."
4.0,"I purchased the blue/black pants in a size small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 1/2‚Äù so the pants fit more like a long Capri, but I‚Äôm okay with that. The bottoms are snug around my calf. They do fit kind of strangely in the crotch area however I also own one of those  neoprene waist sinchers so I simply pull the pants up to a comfortable height and use the sincher to keep them in place. I work out in my home gym so I really don‚Äôt care about the look. Sweat? Oh yeah they really make you sweat! All in all I‚Äôm pretty  satisfied with them."
4.0,Excellent buy!  Well worth the money.  Love it.  Originally I ordered a medium and it was too large then I reordered a small and I have been using it and am very happy but it could be even a little smaller.  Shipping time was excellent.
4.0,Very classy dress fit was great
4.0,"Unless your 4 year old has mammoth hands, these gloves will be too large. I purchased a pair for my 4 year old and for my 7 year old. They are a little big for the 7 year old, but wearable. The 4 year old cannot wear them - way too big!"
4.0,Adorable unique outfit
4.0,Perfect cover up for a cool day
4.0,"Very cute shirt. I thought it would be more of a tannish color. It white. It does fit a little small. I would recommend getting the next size up. Other than that, it is super cute!"
4.0,Longer than expected but look great
4.0,This was a little smaller than I expected. Super cute but did not fit me exactly like I had hoped. It definitely runs small.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
4.0,Good for workdays - to carry the daily ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù
4.0,"I like this shirt and get lots of compliments on it. But be aware, the material is very thin (not see through but just poor quality) so don't expect a lot."
4.0,Love love these socks. I have an addiction for nice socks and if I had the right size they would be my all time favorite they run big. Disappointing because I paid a lot for them
4.0,These shirts were a huge hit and everyone loved them at the Bunko for Breast Cancer Event!
4.0,Not as thick as I  hoped. They seem like they will wash well and get me through the rest of winter. They were $8.
4.0,"It's soft, fits in my pocket. It's a little bulky when my cards are in it but I might just have too many cards in it."
4.0,Delivered faster than expected.  As described and shown in picture!
4.0,A little larger than I thought but a great shirt for the price.
4.0,"Pros- great price, comfortable, fit well, and I especially love that they are a little longer (i'm tall so capris always end up bunched just below my knees).<br /><br />Con- They WILL show sweat.<br /><br />I'd wear them to yoga or around the house, but if you are going running or doing heavy cardio in warm weather, be aware that you will be showing some serious swass."
4.0,Material wasn‚Äôt what I expected
4.0,"This is a fine, resin replica of the mask from the Jim Carrey film, ""The Mask"", which is shipped over from China, so you have to wait at least a couple weeks for it, sometimes more. Mine was projected to arrive after October 31st, I believe (and I think I ordered it in early October), but it in fact arrived before then, so not too bad. The sculpture is great, but here was the big problem for me...<br /><br />This mask comes with an adjustable strap, as if it was meant to be worn as a mask. I am not sure why they would do that, since anyone ordering this is wanting it as a film prop replica, and it makes no sense to wear it. In the film, when this mask is put on the face, it is merged with the face and becomes something different entirely. Wearing this mask as it is makes no sense. Someone buying this is going to hang it on the wall, or carry it around, or in my case, I used it as an aquarium decoration. It is lifesize and looks awesome in my aquarium, but the problem of the straps is removing them. They are attached with metal pieces that are a brutal exercise to remove, even with wire cutters like I used. In the process, I actually broke off a good sized part of one side of the mask! On the bright side, superglue reattached it like new, and with its grain replica design, there's no way you can tell. On the downside, there are holes in each side where the metal pieces for the straps were. Small, but if you look right at 'em, you won't miss 'em. I suppose they can be filled in with something. I'll have to do that soon.<br /><br />The other thing is that, while it is impressive looking and the metal-looking piece in the middle (the nose piece) is beautifully painted to look like real metal, the rest of the mask is a solid, dark brown color. I ended up giving it streaks of a light green wash with acrylic paint, and it came out pretty good. So, basically, if you order this mask, expect some more work to do on it. Have superglue on handy, and go to the hobby store and get a tube of light green, acrylic paint, or as I used, mix some blue and yellow. Also, have some wire cutters and superglue on hand. And, don't try to put a green wash over the metal area. It looks better without it. I'm going to have to repaint that area myself, unfortunately, but the only reason I tried the green wash there was because some of the metal paint chipped off at some point. Maybe it was too thin and flaked off in the fish tank. However, I got some paint to redo it and will take care of that soon. Yeah, it sounds like a lot of work, but it looks amazing when you remove the straps and tweak it with some painting, so it is definitely worthwhile, and this was one of the cheaper versions I was able to find."
4.0,"Although the manufacturers want to extol the compression sock virtue of ‚ÄúEasy-On and Easy-Off‚Äù feature of this product, and I admit that this is why I bought this item, I must honestly say first and foremost that this statement is not true.  Even though these compression socks are a bit large for me, and one would surmise that this would create an ‚ÄúEasy-On and Easy-Off‚Äù fit, it does not.<br /><br />However, the not so ‚ÄúEasy-On and Easy-Off‚Äù socks do have one redeeming quality worthy of their purchase‚Äîthe soft fabric is so comfortable that one can easily wear the Copper Fit Unisex 2.0 socks all day without the pain typically experienced from wearing just about any other generic or brand name compression hosiery.  In fact, I have been able to wear them a few extra hours each day without the return of the usual pain and fatigue I experience when not wearing compression hosiery.  I also bought the older version of Copper Fit compression socks that were replaced by the Copper Fit Unisex 2.0, called Copper Fit Energy Knee High compression socks, which were a bit easier to put on but not as soft and comfortable as the newer version, making the Copper Fit Unisex 2.0 the better purchase.<br /><br />In summary, although the Copper Fit Unisex 2.0 Easy-On and Easy-Off compression socks did not fulfill the promise of being ‚ÄúEasy-On and Easy-Off‚Äù, the soft fabric and all day comfort they provide make them a most worthwhile purchase when compared to other Copper Fit styles and various other generic compression hosiery.  One improvement that the Copper Fit company could offer is a variety of compression levels; a Lg/Xl offers enough length for a woman of average weight and height, but is not tight enough."
4.0,"For most fitness needs, this sports bra works fine. An hour in Zumba, thirty minutes on the treadmill - sure, not a problem. I made the recent mistake of wearing one of these when I knew I'd be working outside most of the day and would get hot and sweaty, and the amount of heat rash I experienced was horrible! Be advised that the fabric doesn't wick and cool for any long-term, intensive training / working."
4.0,"They are good for super cheap shorts.  I wore them at some point during each day of my weeklong vacation at the beach.  They are a bit too short for my taste and for my thighs.  I would not wear them out anywhere except at the beach.  For the price, they are a really good deal.  It seems like really short shorts are coming back into fashion.  I wish these were just about 1-2 inches longer.  I do recommend them for someone looking for a basic and comfortable pair of shorts."
4.0,"Great product for the price. Only complaint is that it is a little thin. Overall, great buy."
4.0,"These capris are very comfortable & I love that they have pockets. I wear most of my blouses not tucked in, so the elastic waist is fine. Biggest problem is that the hem is wide; bell like, not tight around bottom as shown. I wanted them narrow hem! They are so comfortable, I decided to keep them & have the hems narrowed. Length is as shown. Like the knit fabric too."
4.0,"I wear a size 8.5 women's shoe, so I ordered a medium sock. It is a little too big in the foot &amp; REALLY tight in the calves. I like the feel of the socks, but I can not wear them while working g out because they are so tight. Also the picture made it look like the dots on the back are yellow... they are bright orange!<br /><br />Note: I received a discount on my purchase in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I purchased this vent to upgrade my Vision Classic B kamado.  The vent is well made and retains heat better than the thin stainless steel original vent.<br /><br />What's holding me back from a five star rating is that, as another reviewer for this product on a separate listing pointed out, the vent lacks the internal brackets that the original vent has. Those brackets are on the inside of the vent and hold the vent in place while you open the dome by pressing against the inside of the &#34;chimney&#34;. This product doesn't have the brackets and was loose and would fall off when opening the lid. Luckily, I was also replacing the gasket with the Smokeware nomex gasket.  That product gives you enough nomex felt to replace the vent gasket along with the rest of the grill. The result is a nice snug airtight grip on this vent.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this will hold up to the weather. Even if it doesn't rust, the design looks like it can hold some water which may drip into the grill when you open the vent.  I not sure if this will actually happen, but I can imagine it."
4.0,"The gloves are super cute and do keep the sun off.  My only wish was that the little bows had been sewn in place as they came undone almost immediately.  If I were to buy them again, that would be the first thing I would do."
4.0,Nice looking watch but isn't as thin as you would expect from the hype.
4.0,"I would give a 5 stars because they are so cute and warm, but they slide off my feet. I gifted a couple to two girls (7 and 12 yrs old) and I think the socks are too big for them."
4.0,The shirt was a little small on me because I have 34 dd cheats size and the back came up higher then it appeared in the picture. But I'm sure it wil look amazing on my sister for xmas
4.0,"These were really cute. I ordered them following hip surgery when I had to wear compression socks. However, I found them to be too tight so, if I needed them in the future, I would order a larger size."
4.0,"Nice leather and nice look but the size was off and there isn't any way to really adjust this one. It's a standard/traditional fit but larger than expected. Good quality and assuming you are sent the right size, a nice belt with classic good looks."
4.0,"Really nice sparkle.  It has a reflective back that causes this, but I like it anyway.  The chain is nice as pictured and a good quality weight for the charm.  The snowflake charm is a great weight and keeps it in place so that it doesn't flip over showing the backing.  Overall, really pretty."
4.0,Cute dress and fit as expected.
4.0,"This is a nice, soft case that doubles as a lens cleaner.  It is inexpensive, which is good, because sunglass pouches I have previously owned tend to go missing as often as socks in a dryer.  When you are out and about and can't lug the hard case that was provided to you with the purchase of your sunglasses, this is a safe way to keep them from getting scratched in a purse or satchel."
4.0,"I like this dress, and I definitely recommend it, but the material reminds me of a swimsuit, or wet suit. It's heavy. And it bleeds. I put lotion on before putting the dress on and it temporarily dyed my skin black. Also, I washed it a few times before wearing it too. It is very long, so check the sizing before you buy."
4.0,nice super soft. not sweatsuit  materials  I was expecting from pictures  I like it better great for lounging and sleeping
4.0,Looks good perfect
4.0,It is A nice hat but A little stiffer than I like
4.0,I love the color and style and the velcro at the back for adjustment of the circumference of your head but the cotton material on top is loose for my small head.  I wish the material they used was somewhat stretchable for a snug fit.  I'm going to have it alterrated.
4.0,These were perfect for our Nina family Halloween! The only downside for me was the bottoms were pantyhose-tights! That's it. So I wore my own tight black leggings and got lots of compliments. We looked awesome ! InCharacter costumes are ALL I've ever purchased! I will keep that tradition going! Keep the quality going InCharacter!
4.0,I love the look of the dress..
4.0,"This fit as expected.  The white had another pattern in the background that I didn't notice from the pictures posted, but overall was a nice purchase."
4.0,They'd get a fifth star were it not for the drab colors.  The price could not be beat.
4.0,"Not a bad little watch for the price, probably better as a gift for a youngster, I bought this to wear and see how long it will hold up to daily use and so far so good but I have only had it a couple weeks. It‚Äôs not real big and it‚Äôs really light, I really like that in a watch."
4.0,"I like the print. It‚Äôs indigo, right.  The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the way the pockets are made on each side."
4.0,the best replacement band I've purchased
4.0,colors not nearly as nice in person. but they are soft.
4.0,Very cute.  Dress used for gnome costume I made. But only able to wear once as it fit a little small.
4.0,"I've always love a the look of aviator glasses,  UT have  never purchased a pair because my face is round and the frames are usually small and well they just dont suit me. Not the case with these rimless aviators. The frames are bigger and a bit wider and fit my face comfortably. I ended up buying a 2nd pair (silver ones). The only thing is that with this pair in particular, it doesn't give full coverage when out in the sun due to the double tones, may consider getting darker frames, either way, they look great and I'm happy with them"
4.0,"I thought this was a good buy, but my wife hasn't starting using it as yet."
4.0,"These shorts fit true to size, and I love the Bermuda short length. The fabric is a jersey knit, that is a little stiff. These shorts are not as comfortable as pj's or yoga pants, but they are more comfortable than denim and they look like normal shorts rather than lounge shorts, so you can wear them out and about. They have decent sized front pockets, but no back pockets. The waist sits at the natural waist rather than the hip."
4.0,"For the price the pants were nice; although, they ran a little large.  The medium size fit a little large."
4.0,"This will be a Christmas gift, every thing was great. Shipped very fast. I‚Äôm sure she will love it."
4.0,Color fade is my only complaint. It's really good otherwise
4.0,"Really cute, lightweight jacket - Sun protection, running / exercise etc. I got a small, white - it does stain easily and even common stains (Eg sand/dust) seem to stick after multiple washes so have to be careful not to stain it. I would order again."
4.0,They are off white like tan I wish they were white like the picture shows I love all the rest the rest are true to color except the white .
4.0,Fits nice. Came with 2. Stone was a bit smaller than expected. Pretty
4.0,Because fit as expected!
4.0,"Runs very small. I always wear small and I could barely get this up over my thighs. Once up it was okay but still tight enough to see my panty lines. The material felt very comfortable though not sure about the bunching at the waist waste, still on the fence about that. . I look forward to exchanging it for a larger size."
4.0,"Vest is nice, but small"
4.0,Its beautiful but easy to break and put back together but for the price ita amazing id buy it again
4.0,Definitely a product that you have to have the right body type for.
4.0,This is cute. Looks just like the picture.
4.0,Like it. Will buy again. Served its purpose. I don‚Äôt give out 5 stars unless is near perfect to me... and you know nothing is perfect.
4.0,"Not really much heel support for plantar fasciitis. More designed for arch support.gavd to my daughter who has flat feet. I have high arches and plantar fasciitis so this did not help me. It's more of a stiff arch support,"
4.0,"Nice Bands. Pretty good looking, nice material, comfortable and nice fit."
4.0,"Heading pretty much says it. This is a very nicely made piece of leather goods at a nice price. It is supposed to be a men's product, but I find it larger than is convenient. It is suitable for carrying in the back pocket, but if I wanted to do that I would probably get a thin conventional wallet. I have never carried a wallet or other large object in my back pocket, because it's uncomfortable sitting and ruins the fit of any good clothing. I will need to resume my search for the proper size change purse."
4.0,Almost too thick. But very comfortable and the design is awesome!!
4.0,Love the kimono.
4.0,Adorbs quality and perfect gift for teen girls
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because I have difficulty wearing the shoe covers. It was too small. We had to cut the back part to fit it. The belt was a little loose so I had to sew to fit my waist. Otherwise it‚Äôs very good, the material is great! Very good quality."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:625c5fdddbc2ee4c7239a01f059fb6c8]] Got this for my ""cigar"" watch (SARX088) as it reminded me of a cigar leaf. Very unique look and design. Soft rubber underside. Despite the soft rubber, it still wears a bit stiff and seems to want to twist on my arm. Not terribly so but enough for me to notice. Very pricey... While I feel I overpaid for this, I am still not mad at the overall look and uniqueness of it. Which is a big part of what you are paying for. The quality is there but not quite at a level I expected at this price point. If you have the means, it is worth it if this is the look you are going for."
4.0,"My neck is pretty small so I knew this would happen, but even in the smallest size it's like a centimeter big for me. Other than this I would say it deserves 5 stars."
4.0,Not the colors I thought but still nice!
4.0,"I like these although I think they are nicer for little girls.  One thing though, they need to include backs for the earrings.  Most of the earrings I've ordered don't have any backs to them."
4.0,So far this is the best fitting pants I have ordered. I'm a 46 waist and 28 inseam so it's very difficult to get the right look and fit without looking baggy. Have bought several different makes and styles ie docker type and jeans and none of them have fit as good as these. Material is very comfortable. Would like to buy more however at this time can only buy black in my size which seems to be a limitation with other brands as well.
4.0,"It would have 5 stars if only it was brighter, it does glow in the dark but barely."
4.0,The skirt is beautiful and I love the material. Should have went a size bigger.
4.0,Awesome product. Very pleased.  Would recommend to others.
4.0,"BeaUtiful dress (shirt). I love the material; it's very 'flowing..'  There's no way this could be a dress. I'm 5'7"", and athletic built. I ordered a large, and It's very short in the front. It's very pretty, tho. I'm going to dress it up with a pair of leggings. It has several colors, so I can switch it up from time to time. I'd order another in a different color."
4.0,The gold looks back.
4.0,"I own a few CC beanies. The pompom‚Äôs on these are much smaller than the other ones I own,  but the beanie itself is nice, thick and warm."
4.0,"Even though this dress is big in the chest area for small chested people, its very flattering and i was impressed with the material. Stop thinking and buy this dress! I am 145 and 5'4"" and i ordered a medium and i am happy with it. Size down for a bit more fitted look"
4.0,It was good value.  It look good with brown shirt.
4.0,Very cute outfit and great quality but does run a tad small.
4.0,"I really love my boots. They've held up decently. They're very comfortable. Like all boots they do get warm, but that's to be expected. My only issue is I've had them about a month and a half and already the inside sole is coming out."
4.0,"I just received these the other day. I love the heavy fabric it's made out of, the ones I'm using now are very thin and are starting to rip as I use them. I think I'll be using these for many years to come and when it is time to dispose of the bag I'm glad it won't be in some landfill but in a compost heap where it will be going back into the cycle of life. I also like that it has longer handles do I can place them over my headrest on my electric wheelchair."
4.0,"If you have large breasts, maybe order up a size. But i myself don't mind the snug fit since it just enhances the curves. Overall, happy with the dress. Color and dress shape are exactly as described."
4.0,"Satisfied with style, color and fit.  However there is an unusual odor on them for which I'm not pleased.  During the spring and summer, I'll let them air out to minimize the odor from the material."
4.0,"Very attractive, but a bit heavier than I expected."
4.0,"They are not very high waisted and the material used slides down a lot. It's kind of slick material,  I may have slipped off a couple chair's"
4.0,I like the fact that these Corvara shirts are light weight and this great for summer riding. I also love the fact that there is no elastic at the bottom of the shirt unlike other cycling jerseys. The fit is slightly big but once again great for the heat of summer time. I bought three of these Corvara Jerseys so that suggest I am satisfied with the purchase and definitely would recommend the product
4.0,"This product looks and feels good. However, the size was too large."
4.0,The shirt is a good fit and the material is nice and soft.
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this top.  I like the flow to the material and the way it fits on me.  I wear a size 14 and have an hourglass shape and this fits great.  I imagine it would fit almost any size from 2-18 depending on how you want it to hang and drape and what body shape you have.  Larger sizes like myself might be tight around the hips if you have a pear shape.  My only complaint is the first time I washed it the seem came undone on one shoulder which I repaired myself and haven't had any problems since.
4.0,"I just didn't like the smell, it has a strong chemical smell."
4.0,"This one screams what if ‚Äúan ugly Christmas sweater and a comfy PJ had a baby‚Äù lol. In all honesty, this one is comfy and filled with Christmas spirit. It will work really well with my wife for Christmas Day to open gifts and chill. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a five star rating was that it runs way too big, so if looking to order, should order one size smaller.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask‚Ä¶ Thank you!"
4.0,Very cute.. great for casual outing
4.0,Fit perfectly. I'm wearing them right now in fact. Very nice improvement.
4.0,The price is good and it looks pretty decent.
4.0,"It's quite stiff even after a few washes, but, looks fantastic and does exactly what it's intended for. It is a little heavy. I wouldn't recommend it for restaurant work but it's extremely durable just heavy which in return makes it 10 times hotter"
4.0,Top was a little large under the arm
4.0,"Great quality, beautiful dress with white breathable white top attached to dress. You will need to press or steam the dress a day before it took me about 30 mins. Fast shipping. Helpful tip. Take measurements of your biceps and arms. The sizing was almost too small. I could have sizes up however it would have been longer. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô and 140ibs 34DD chest."
4.0,It‚Äôs not a solid maroon color like the picture. It‚Äôs maroon and white knit. It‚Äôs still pretty. Next time I‚Äôd order one size larger for the comfort. I wore it with black leggings and a black spaghetti strap tank underneath and it looked really cute. I wish it was a little longer in the front. I‚Äôd buy again.
4.0,Liked but too many
4.0,Bigger than I thought it was lol but still very pretty
4.0,The color was perfect! My son was able to get the bow of the tie out of its loop... But that was an easy fix.
4.0,Lovely.  Exactly as described.
4.0,"Doesn't have as much slouch as I'd have liked, and definitely not very stretchy, due to the cloth lining on the inside.  Overall a warm and comfy beanie, just not very long for a slouch beanie."
4.0,I like the black/black.  The frame shape is really unique
4.0,"Looks like the pictures. To me it's a thinner material than I was expecting but I still like it. Not sure how well it'll hold up long term, but I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,The plastic odor does not dissipate
4.0,In loveeee with this!!! It's so comfy and feels so nice! The material is super comfortable. It looks just like the picture too.
4.0,It worked as intended. They are very soft.
4.0,Very cute fit both my daughter and granddaughters.<br />But strong chemical smell in fabric lining.  Had to be washed before using.
4.0,"Good quality, this it's one size only, so it's a little bit big on me cause I'm size small.<br />But good to use on top of my sleep dress"
4.0,Love this . I only took off one star because the gold already chipped a little
4.0,I love it and it says what I want to say to my daughter all the time. It is hanging on her rear view mirror in her car..
4.0,I actually live everything about this dress except that with the pockets (great feature) its too narrow at hips for an hourglass figure.
4.0,"I got the band in the tan color with the silver strap. Pairs with the Apple Watch beautifully & looks very classy. However, I feel that it interferes with the activity sensors and does not accurately depict my activity for the day. Bummer."
4.0,"I posted questions about the appropriate size; I wear US size 32-34 waist BUT I have large/thick thighs.  It was recommended for me to get the Label size 34.  Received all three today;one was label size 36.  The Label size 34 had enough room around the waist for me to fit my fist, which I'm fine.  But the problem was with my thighs.  The pants were too tight around my thighs were they almost felt like they would rip when sitting down.  Length was fine and I'm 6'1&#34;.  If you can wear skinny jeans than these will fit you; if you are the type that is fit but also have muscular thighs, then might not be the appropriate pants for you.  I put a refund request and will update my post after they respond.  Material is good; sad that they don't fit my legs."
4.0,The jeans fit really nice. They have a great stretch. They don‚Äôt have the gapping that a lot of other jeans have.
4.0,I liked for the price and a great gift for my sister!
4.0,"Got this for my mother-in-law who lives overseas, where they don't have aspen trees.<br />She loved them,  so I'm content."
4.0,"Very pretty, nice color contrast. Very fat, but they work great for my shoes."
4.0,Nice shoe and is holding up.
4.0,"Really good necklace, felt very sturdy. The pendant is larger than I expected from what is in the movie and chain is also much shorter than the movie. But it‚Äôs still really nice."
4.0,"This is a great quality, no see through workout top. Comfy built in bra. Great style. However, the sizing here put me at a Large, and the Large is comically baggy for form-fitting style top everywhere but the hips. The hips fit okay until I started walking, and then they rode up like crazy. I'm going to need this to be tighter if I'm going to be doing any extended walking or yoga. I'll be re-ordering a Medium to see if that does the trick. For reference, I'm a bit pear shaped at 5'6.5""-- 152lbs -- 32D -- Measurements 36"" 31"" 41"""
4.0,at the waist still smaller than normal
4.0,The only reason for the 4 stars is that I feel i slip a but maybe just sweat but norma for most sandals. I just have wide feel and felt they didnt quite fit in width. Other than that I got alot of compliments and I was comfortable the whole day!
4.0,"As you can see from the picture, it doesn't fit perfectly, but still fine. Effective to protect the face from the sun, especially in TX. Like it!"
4.0,"All of us early reviewers seem to have ordered size ""34,"" but two received ""34x34,"" two received ""34x30,"" and I feel like Goldilocks because I got ""34x32"" and that length is just right for me. Hopefully they'll start being more specific about the sizing.<br /><br />The waist on the ""34x32"" I got measures 36"" inside, which is actually what most 34s measure (because we're bigger there than we think), and it stretches out to about 39"". So if you normally wear a 34 waist, meaning you usually have 36"" of room, these will feel good. According to the label, these have 2% elastane, not 1% as the description says.<br /><br />The inseams measure about 32"" as claimed.<br /><br />The cut is a little relaxed in the seat, but it's the same in the legs as some similarly-sized regular-cut Lee jeans I have. They're a little stretchy to feel a little more relaxed.<br /><br />They ride a little lower than the Lees, evidently lower than some prefer based on what others say, but they feel OK for me with a belt to keep them from getting any lower. That lessens the room in the crotch, but not uncomfortably so.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach only if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh."
4.0,I love the size of the glasses.  The only downfall is the metal ear pieces are very flimsy and cheap feeling.
4.0,"It was exactly as it said it was and my boyfriend loved it but some of the orange paint in the Roman numeral 3 chipped out, we used some acrylic paint markers but shouldn‚Äôt have to so soon. Other than that it was worth the $7"
4.0,"It fits somewhat big on the neck line, but not to bad, it's ok the daughter still loves it, wore it this past weekend.."
4.0,"Cute little head chain. Worth it for the price. Looks like i can get a few uses out of it, i'm sur eit won't last a lifetime though."
4.0,Beautiful and awesome material. Run small.
4.0,"This is a gift, it looks really nice and think he will love it."
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my sister, she loved it"
4.0,This shirt did not fit as expected but I do love the bright colors in it! It is soft as well. I would suggest sizing down unless you like a looser fit. The company has been very helpful and generous with the refund process.
4.0,Material is good and it looks sexy
4.0,"Comfortable fit, no biding at hem."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful and very well made! Unfortunately, it is not for someone with a small torso or small bust. The lace part comes down far too low on me and shows my bra both in the front and on the sides. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and a 34A. The material is very flowy, and the length is perfect to wear either as is or with a belt. I ordered the turquoise one and although it‚Äôs more of a darker green than I was expecting, that didn‚Äôt bother me.<br /><br />Pros: beautiful, well-made dress<br /><br />Cons: cut too low on top"
4.0,They look good but I really haven't had enough time to test them out and use them on the water.
4.0,Little bit too big to me
4.0,"Liked it a lot - but he liked another style better, so returning. It's just as it looks. NICE!"
4.0,"Small is too big for me, but, they are well made.I just wish there was extra small!"
4.0,"I really really really like these earrings,  they are very pretty. But they are not as big as they are on the picture so I give them 4 stars."
4.0,I wish the padding was just a little thicker.
4.0,"Generally, a solid, well-made and attractive product. Still waiting to figure out how the exposed permanent marker name/address lines are going to withstand air travel...<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Tags are bright and fully plastic, no flimsy paper inserts that can fall out, suffer from moisture, or suffer other damage, and it feels great!<br />2. A permanent marker really works and leaves distinct (hopefully permanent) text on the white text strips.<br />3. Metallic attachment rings are solid and well-made, way better than old-style leather strips that tended to break or tear apart after some [inevitable] airline abuse<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. While my daughter was able to write her and mom's name and address on the white strips neatly, these are too narrow for my clumsy fingers (didn't even try to do the writing myself). I would suggest reducing the number of these strips but making them taller, to make it easier to write text. Four lines of text should be sufficient.<br />2. While permanent marker is supposed to stay ... permanent, I would prefer to have a thin, transparent plastic cover (only attached on one side and bendable) to keep it from airline damage."
4.0,I like the jacket.  It's smaller than expected.
4.0,I loved it. I got my sons birth stone and im absolutely in love with it. Great quality. Doesnt turn your skin green.
4.0,Great fit. Definitely gets the job done. A little too short and rubs on side.
4.0,for the money it looks like a very expense piece of jewelry  I love it I wear it all the time lets see how l it lasts lol
4.0,"I bought it for my 6-year old, who is learning to tell time, and he loves it. I like its readibility. It has the hour numbers and a separate set of larger numbers by 5's to teach the minutes. It addition the hands of the watch are labeled. The only complaint that my son has is that the velcro bracelet its uncomfortable (scratchy) to his wrist. That has not stop him from wearing it. My own concern - it hasn't happened yet-- is that velcro over time gets worn out and I anticipate being dropped inadvertently one day."
4.0,"It can block the sun when working outdoors, good things and cheap."
4.0,"Just a tad tight, but really cute."
4.0,The sweatshirt is no very thick but it‚Äôs very cute and the pants are soft
4.0,"Light weight, good colors"
4.0,"Comfortable, nice looking sweater poncho.  Gave as a gift, after I tried it on.  Would buy again."
4.0,Great price for all-inclusive package!
4.0,"I like how versatile it is, it's a nice big bag that can become compact at ease. Great product,no problems.:)"
4.0,It fits great and is very lovely. It will shrink! I have to wear leggings since it shortened so much but that's okay. The material is comfortable but it sticks to everything and I have to use a lint roller every time. I'm not sure where it finds fuzz but everything sticks to it. Apart from that it's perfect.
4.0,"I got married 4 days ago and my mother passed away just a few days prior it was really important to me that I had some way to honor her. This bouquet charm turned out absolutely perfect. However, it came with no adhesive and no instructions for the software so I had to print my own picture at cvs and glue the picture of my mother down myself. A bit frustrating at first but it worked out and I was so happy that I made this purchase."
4.0,"This hoodie was purchased as a Christmas gift for my Dad.  I will tell you what I can for now.  It arrived when promised and was the color I anticipated.  The package and hoodie was intact.  The material was somehow different than I expected, maybe more of a synthetic feel to it than I had wanted but it seems soft enough.  As long as it fits well, I would say it's a ""keeper""."
4.0,"Beautiful piece. However, the crocheted lace bottom of the tank doesn't stretch at all and I am a little bit hippy. But it works for me, I just wanted it to be a little looser all over.  I wore it to church under a Logo top and got 2 compliments before I sat down. I weigh 165lbs, and normally a large in tanks fit me looser.. I wear a L in leggings or between 12 and 14 in bottoms.  If you are a bigger size 14 in leggings/pants, this will be too small at hem for you.  Hope this helps."
4.0,Love this dress and have gotten many compliments...It was a bit too loose at the top and was a bit see through as others have stated. I will buy another but in small instead of medium
4.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
4.0,"I ordered both the gray with white logo and light blue with blue logo. I am 5'2"" and 143 lbs. I wanted them to fit loosely so I ordered a large. They are definitely not oversized... probably meant to fit to size. The light blue was what i would expect from a size large and the material soft. The gray fit a little more snug and material is a little rough but stretched out after wearing for a while. They are low rise and a little long since I'm short but it doesn't matter because they're cuffed. Overall I am happy with them but wanted to warn about the inconsistency in sizing and material."
4.0,"Per the LACEEZ website, the sizes are designed for a shoe with 5 eyelets. I bought the child XS for a size 8 toddler shoe. If I had 5 eyelets to work with, the size probably would have been fine. I had to get creative and tie a bow into the laces to make they fit for a 3 eyelet shoe. So keep that in mind if you can't size down for a shoe with less than 5 eyelets. But as long as my hack stays and works, I'll be happy!"
4.0,"Woah, getting this as a replacement strap is definitely a good and cheaper way to restore my dad's watch! I got the watch as a hand-me-down, but it certainly looks like it's brand new because of this band."
4.0,"It is what I ordered, just a little small.  Good quality! Exchanged for one size larger"
4.0,Beautiful teal turquoise colors and draping. But too short and clingy. I get so tired of these supposedly plus size tops being too small. It is more synthetic feeling in person than it looks online. And definitely not long enough for leggings. I returned it.
4.0,"Such an awesome shirt!!! It's light, breathable, stylish, and on top of that affordable! I wanna buy more!!! I just wish they made an xs cause I'm extremely short and if I don't pull it back my titties show lol"
4.0,"This necklace is lightweight, and versatile as it will complement basically anything I want to wear it with.  It is costume jewelry, and for the price, it is what I would expect.  I look forward to wearing it with many different outfits this fall.  I bought a different necklace (from a different seller) before this one, and that one arrived broken and I had to send it back immediately.  This one is a keeper."
4.0,Wow! My daughter absolutely hates these pants....which makes me love them all the more;) They run really big (I'm 5 1/2 ft/105 lbs) and they fit rather like a balloon skirt. I'm hoping that a few wash/dry cycles will make them a tad smaller. Totally unattractive but well made and the fabric is great. These are perfect for Saturday hanging around the house or embarrassing your children at Walmart. Company should consider offering petite options for those of us who are vertically challenged...I'd buy them all!
4.0,"Good , but it was broke , 2strands,But it was worth the money spent."
4.0,"I first bought a size M because I have about 15 other shirts in the same style by the Kliegou and Yininf brands (which are identical brands). I always hang dry my shirts so they never pill nor shrink. Based on reviews I saw that this shirt in particular runs small. This is accurate. I returned the M and exchanged for an XL -- which was slightly big. I ran it in the dryer for about 30 mins on normal heat and it shrank down to the same size as the M in the other prints I've purchased. So go up two sizes and don't throw it in the dryer unless you want it to shrink. Other than that this shirt is perfect if you're stocky or big-bellied. I'm 5'4"" and 190 lbs. I carry all my weight in the middle. It's a perfect, preferred loose fit."
4.0,"Wish there was an XL, would have been perfect. I usually wear M/L, the bottoms were a little too tight. Other than that I loved it."
4.0,I purchased this dress to take on an international trip. I was able to wear it multiple ways... as-is and then with a white sweater (and it made the outfit look like a sweater/skirt ensemble). Length is just right -- I was able to wear with flats and no dragging material on the ground.
4.0,"After reading comments, I ordered a size medium (I usually wear a small) and I probably could have ordered the small. It's a bit large, but still wearable. I will say, however, that the sleeves aren't even and one shoulder seam sits lower down my shoulder than the other, which makes one sleeve hit right where it's supposed to and the other long enough to cover part of my hand. This also means the neckline is a bit uneven and one side shows a bit more shoulder than the other. Neither of these issues make it unwearable for me, considering the overall price and speed of delivery. It isn't the nicest dress I own, but works well for me as it falls a little below the knees and isn't too tight. As a high school teacher, I need to wear stuff that looks decent but isn't too showy and since I teach science, I need stuff that is easily replaceable in case of accidents. This definitely fits the bill."
4.0,The shirt fits as expected beautiful print. I am very pleased.
4.0,Very nice. Larger than I thought but perfect size. Attention to detail. Print design on backside in the metal. 3D almost in appearance with the bevel shape of the glass over the picture of the tardis. I hope the thin chain doesn't break. Otherwise very nice.
4.0,"Larger than it appear, but it holds my sweater and my Erin Condren, which is why I purchased it."
4.0,Be careful with these! The balls fall off very easily if not turned on super tight using a tool. I went through many rings due to one of the balls falling off i had to order a whole new pack before i used tweezers to tightly twist the balls on and now I‚Äôve had the same ring in for months without a fall out!
4.0,Daughter loved the necklace. I specifically picked this one because of the red gems. My grandsons birthstone is ruby and my daughter loves skulls so it was a perfect bday gift for her. He turns one tomorrow... happy bday little guy! My daughter has only had necklace for 2 months gems are already gone. If it weren't for that I'd give u  5 stars.
4.0,We love these!  We are repeat customers!
4.0,"These are cute and bigger than expected. They look a bit cheap as well, which was expected because of price."
4.0,"Really flat flip flops, no support."
4.0,workes as advertised.  Keeps my feet nice and warm wile standing on frozen ground or in snow.
4.0,Super cute light weight material.
4.0,IT SO LONG AND THE FIT IS NOT AS I WOULD WANT. ITS A LOT LOOSER THAN I WOULD WANT IT TO BE. IT IS COMFORTABLE AND I HAVE RECEIVED COMPLIMENTS.
4.0,Fast shipping and product was as expected.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful swimwear, I normally wear size 8/M , so I ordered M, it was slightly loose and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would stay put in water so got it exchanged for small. I‚Äôm still awaiting my order for small but it fits and looks beautiful!!"
4.0,The color orange is great and I love the fabric. The sleeve are short and it runs small overall. I rarely wear an x-large and really wanted a loose shirt. It fits more like a large. I am keeping it. I am wondering if other sizes may run bigger.
4.0,The fit is a standard men‚Äôs XL. I expected the grey to be a bit more of a true grey but it‚Äôs more of a blue-ish grey. The graphic is hilarious.
4.0,Nice fit  Contemporary style
4.0,"These are the same Hanes under shirts you would buy at your favorite big box retailer, only a little better priced. My husband works outdoors year round and wanted to switch to black tanks when replacing his white ones and these were super convenient. He's 6'4&#34; and about 260lbs mostly lean, but getting a little round in the middle. There is by all means &#34;room to grow&#34; left in these tanks for him so they sit a little low currently (they cover his butt). Otherwise shipping was on time, product is in good shape, overall we a quite happy with the purchase. Only gave four stars because they didn't have all black and we had to get black and gray."
4.0,"Not what I was expecting had a shiny tint on the lens, but I rocked them anyways."
4.0,"My husband wears a medium size in shirts.  This is a great, silky sweatshirt and the colors are very vibrant.  The only issue is that it is very large for him.  I am keeping it because I can wear it with leggings since it's so long."
4.0,Would have given it 5 stars but one of the rivets popped out already.
4.0,"I GOT THESE PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE OF MY HONEST REVIEW ,.I GIVE4 STAR WHY ITS BECAUSE I LIKE IT SO SOFT AND SMOOTH TO WEAR,. THE DESIGN ARE GOOD I LIKE THE LICE TOP OF IT KIND OF SEXY AND CUTE TO WEAR IT,. VERY GOOD COLOR and good to wear it everyday , one thing that I don't like it is somewhat large of me that's it, but the quality are good materials are really good as well , I like it cause so cofy to wear and nice looking design ,. over all of these product are good"
4.0,I went by the reviews for the size and I actually ordered a size bigger than I should have.<br />I am a small and should have gotten the small.<br />If you are petite order a small.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Looks as shown<br />2. Great Price<br />3. Good material<br />4. Easy zip up<br /><br />Cons<br />1. The sizing was off only due to other peoples reviews
4.0,True to size. Comfortable.
4.0,Product arrived on schedule. Quality is good. I've received compliments on the item when wearing it
4.0,It's fine for what it is.
4.0,Pendant nice chain too then easily breaks when it gets intangled in hair just got to buy bigger chain
4.0,"These are beautiful and very detailed. I wore them for my wedding and they looked very classy. My only complaint is that one of the screws fell out and it made them asymmetrical. To be fair though we were partying hard, so sometimes things break haha"
4.0,Great pattern and material but for someone 5‚Äô6‚Äù the length was a little short but wearable
4.0,Watch comes exactly as pictured. It was a gift for my husband. He always takes his watches to his watch guy to look at and he told him great quality watch! He's only worn once but he received a ton of compliments. Yellow is a little brighter than image.
4.0,Its just as seen but I was a hair tweaked when I saw the same item at Walmart yesterday for $2. My fault for shopping online not in the stores. Good product though.
4.0,"I am not fond of the French and it was not understood that this could be identified by Frenchmen as a French hat. Suddenly every Frenchman in my neighborhood wants to be friends. I got it because I lost a bet but after wearing it on a hot day, I totally understand why people wear them. They really do keep you cool and I feel so ignorant for making fun of people that wear them. I still avoid the Frenchmen in the neighborhood but one of them has a smoking hot wife so I invited her to lunch...I'm wearing the hat."
4.0,To small for my calves
4.0,"It is exactly as pictured, and works like it shows. The only thing is that the cuff that holds it to your ear bends, so be careful when dealing with it so it won't break. You get what you pay for in terms of metal quality, so if you have any allergies be aware with that. Other than the metal cuff bending, I am very pleased with the product."
4.0,"A little heavy but cute for 4 bucks. They will go with anything, dress up or dress down."
4.0,"It's comfortable, but not too heavy. Pockets!!!!! But didn't really hold up to heavy activity."
4.0,I bought an XL. Im a size 13 in jr pants. Fit well in the front and around the waist.  The back seemed a bit long (it went up to my waist)  but manageable. Its made of swimsuit material also. Overall im happy with it. Looking forward to wearing it at the beach.
4.0,Smaller than I expected but still looks great
4.0,Got a Large and its a loose fit.  5'2  157lbs 34B This dress is great with pasties instead of a bra if you have small boobs.  The back of the dress scoops below my bra strap.  Print is not see-through.  Material does not stretch. Material is thin but perfect for hot and humid Georgia summers.  Make sure to static spray the dress before going out -- the dress sticks to your legs a little.  Straps are adjustable.  Stitching is good quality.  Great date night dress!
4.0,Good .Suited well with my dress
4.0,"These are super cute! If you're a thicker gal like me and have fuller thighs, beware-- they ride up!"
4.0,"The mask over all is of great quality, The mess over the eyes rub your eyes, pair of safety glasses fixed that, but they fog up. Mask needs to come in larger sizes for those of us with fat heads. lol Extremely tight. But it does look really well."
4.0,"Hubby and I ordered pink for me and blue for him. Pretty good quality but not perfect on the sewing.  This wallet is smaller than we thought it would be. Holds cards well in the center but not much room on outside.  Still, for our purpose they will work great.  We ordered a 3 pc. credit card size magnifying glass with this order and it was not delivered, record is stating it was delivered.  Need to contact Amazon to let them know we did not get those items."
4.0,"Used these for a town easter egg hunt prize to put in the eggs.  Kids love them. Great price.  Only thing, just a few didn't work!"
4.0,"A lot of the reviews said order a size larger because it's Chinese sizing so I did, but I wish I wouldn't have. If you're top heavy then that would be good advice but I'm bottom heavy and my mid section is smaller. I gave it 4/5 because the dress is NOT purple and pink it's blue and pink but still cute. I was just expecting purple."
4.0,very sturdy and seem to be quality.
4.0,Perfect size to fit in the credit card section of my wallet.  They pinch a little when you first put them on but that goes away and their usefulness far outweighs that tiny bit of discomfort.
4.0,Very soft but a bit short
4.0,Really cute. and looks just like one from Soma.
4.0,Fit well seem to be quality construction. Lining a bit uncomfortable
4.0,This shirt is really nice it fits perfect it's just a little short but the width is fine other than that it's perfect
4.0,"Pants for perfect, jacket very snug. My son wear a size 12-14 youth."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for; would have given 5 stars except need to have bracelet shortened as not good with tool included so will see a jewler because I am a very petite lady.
4.0,Nice underwear but I prefer the underarmour brand you get 2 pair for the same money
4.0,Quality is excelkent just an inconvenient design
4.0,They great. Serve  there purpose but attract lint because of the silicone material they made from..
4.0,"I got this to avoid using my phone alarm and waking up my partner. Plus, it's VERY hard to sleep though. I don't use the noise aspect of the alarm, just the vibration and zap. I don't set the vibration very high, but it's usually enough to start to wake me and 15 seconds after, I get a zap (at 40% strength). When the alarm goes off, I then have to get my phone to cancel the alarm, so I work fast! Haha!<br /><br />It has a couple of settings for smoother wake up as well. One is a light sleep alarm. It detects your sleep state and starts to wake up 20 minutes before your first alarm while you're in less of a sleep state. I mainly use the escalating feature though. It starts the stimulus lighter and slowly builds up intensity until it hits the max (whatever you set them to).<br /><br />You can also print out a QR code you have to scan. I haven't done that yet. The battery lasts about a week, it  seems. About 4 or 5 days I think. They only way to know is to open the app and check the level there. I COULD wear it all day since it can be used as a step counter and a behavior correction device, but I mainly use it for an alarm and sleep tracking. A little pricey, but I don't ever overslept anymore."
4.0,I use these shirts for sleeping and so far am satisfied with them.  I wished they also had the binding around the neck like around the end of the sleeves like my old ones had but couldn't find. So far these Aiyinos seem to be okay as I've only been using them a little over a month now.  One great thing about them is the material is very soft so make it comfortable as a sleep shirt.
4.0,"I bought it as a gift for my brother, I know he will love it."
4.0,"One expects a compression shirt to ride up off the butt and bunch at the waist.  This one does that, but not to the degree of most of them.  Comfortable."
4.0,"I have 36DDD and got a medium and it was way to big for me, if there was an XS I would get that but since they only go to small I won‚Äôt repurchase, but seems like good quality"
4.0,"THese are great garden gloves. However, the claws are not removable and they are only right handed so it wont work for left handers and lmit some activity with the right hand."
4.0,"nice sunglasses but too small for my 5 yrs old kid, i think fit well for a 1 yr kid"
4.0,"The outer shell is comfortable and easy to wear, it fits well and is not tight in the sleeve. However, the inner part is extremely tight and hard to get zipped. I cannot wear both or just the inner shell while driving because it is so tight I lose movement range. I understand that the inner shell must be smaller but this is an extreme difference. I have just replaced the inner part with another zipper hoody I have."
4.0,"Really nice watch - nice size and look to it. Comes in a nice gift box too. The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is that one of the loops on the band that hold the extra band amount is stationary. It is so close to the clasp that you have to bend the band way back to get it into the first loop which will cause the band to look old and worn far more quickly. And beside that, it's just plain frustrating to get it on that way.  I just go over the top of the first loop into the second, but if that one breaks, as they so often do, there is no second loop to use and then the band is useless."
4.0,They were exactly as described and the materials and construction seem first rate and I would expect them to hold up well . They were a perfect fit for the safety glasses I keep on hand for my students. At this price I would deem them an outstanding value.
4.0,"These are great looking straps, they are a bit short but usable. I would buy them again. The quality is not the best as some are already showing signs of wear from first use."
4.0,"I really love this suit even though it fits a little tight. I got a size large, and am 5ft 5in and have a thicker shape. I have a hard shape to fit so I wasn't disappointed, it still flatters where it needs to. As a mom with a not so tight belly, it really did flatten it and gives the illusion of a beautiful shape! Im very satisfied!"
4.0,"I ordered the blue and got green am I missing something. The box shoes and so does the description Tasnim<br />metallic. The picture online is blue, the shoe I received is green. (with the same description)"
4.0,Somewhat big! It kept falling! lol it's pretty though.not fitted nor it would keep you warm. I wore another pants underneath it since it's too cold! It's like wearing plastic.
4.0,These earrings are not too big or little I live them will bit another pair
4.0,"Very beautiful, make sure no water gets on it or the color will change within a day or two."
4.0,"I purchased the burgundy, dress, but it‚Äôs not burgundy, it‚Äôs the color of a red rose.  Not ugly, but I would have preferred it to be as shown.<br /><br />It‚Äôs really not made to be off the shoulder.  I have small shoulders and it isn‚Äôt a wide neckline.  But it has good stretch so you can wear it off one or both shoulders and it stays put without ruining the top.<br /><br />I ordered the MEDIUM based on the size chart recommendation and it is too big.  The shoulder and bust area are fine, it‚Äôs so wide In the hips and legs area.  Like many others (wish I had read more reviews), I would suggest ordering a size down.  I probably won‚Äôt wear it out of the house because it‚Äôs bigger than I thought it would be.  It has a certain sense of style though.  I may order a small next time and see how that looks.<br /><br />If you have proportionately very large hips for your size you may want to order the recommended size.  I think the dress would flatter the fuller hipped ladies nicely if you like concealing problem areas, as I do.<br /><br />It‚Äôs worth the price and I was surprised that the fabric was not thinner.  I expected something cheaper for the price.  It‚Äôs well sewn and has a lot of stretch as it‚Äôs 95% rayon / 5% cotton."
4.0,My son loved this shirt being a Noles fan and not a Gator Fan. Good quality shirts. Fits ad expected.
4.0,The pro of this product is that they came in the right size and are a easy fit.<br />The con of the product is that they screw on and sometimes they pinch the ear lobe making it very painful.
4.0,Plush and very cute
4.0,"I used to ware these a long time ago, having a party and need this for my outfit."
4.0,I loved the colour
4.0,"One of the best dresses I own (plus there are pockets); however, the design of the zipper on the side is both unnecessary AND adds an insane amount of uncomfortable rub from the material surrounding the zipper."
4.0,"was very excited to receive this product, but the spine itself is very curved. contacted the company and they were quick and eager to provide a solution. very pleased."
4.0,The Mrs. Loves them.<br />They're just like the Spa slippers you get at the better Spa's.<br />Good product at a fair price.
4.0,Loved this too
4.0,I really like this little purse.  It is just the right size for carrying little essentials. I would order it again for the price.
4.0,This necklace has really good color and substance.  I like it and will wear it often.  The rose gold color of the chain is hard to mix in with my earrings which  is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
4.0,"I do like those mittens. I liked the zipper feature for easy slip on for my 3.5 year old boy, size 5-7 works good and have room to grow. The only down side is that the mittens are little too tight around the wrists(( not sure how long they will work for my boy. Hoping they will stretch. But might have to look for another pair. I do recommend it and will keep them since I have girls who can use them."
4.0,"Came on time, nice size"
4.0,You get what you pay for so for everyone complaining about cheap material; get over it. I wish it flattered shoulders better or more flowy at bottom but love it do the price. Plenty of room. I am a 2X and 5'2
4.0,"I wish it were thicker, but it quickly became my favorite scarf during Minnesota's winter."
4.0,Great value and looks good on. Just might need a size up
4.0,"The material is gorgeous; this is a beautiful suit!  It is definitely a slim fit suit, so be prepared for that.  I bought it for my husband when it was on sale, so it was well worth the price."
4.0,I bought this for my daughters second birthday.(she‚Äôs a December baby) We had just moved to Indy from Hawaii so the sweater fit her perfectly! I ordered it a little bit for her in hopes I could get her to wear it for her next birthday.
4.0,"I just ordered this, and received it a full day before it was supposed to arrive! I like it a lot, though the gem is a bit off, but I can just glue it back if it falls off. I didn't like the cord though. The pendant isn't heavy enough for it, so the cord's weight pulled the necklace up against my neck. Also, the cord is a bit coarse, so I restrung the pendant on a chain I had on hand, and it works a whole lot better! All in all, a great buy. And if you have a bit of a creative side, I would recommend using beading supplies to make a better necklace out of it!"
4.0,"I should have been warned by the title, Habiller Women's Tall Size Classic skirt. It is, indeed, very long. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and, in order to get a correct length so I could walk, I had to wear it up to my bra. So I will need to hem this quite a bit. It has an elasticized, drawstring waist that accommodates many different sizes. It is very pretty and flows well. It is not stiff but very soft and breathable for those summer months. It is very comfortable. There is a lot of fabric in this skirt. Half of the length of the skirt is lined. The colors and the pattern are pleasing, in spite of the fact that I do not usually like these colors.  It is striking with a solid, dark top.<br /><br />This skirt is 100% cotton. It may be dry cleaned, hand washed or washed in a gentle cycle. It may be dried in the dryer on very low heat. It should not be ironed."
4.0,"The pant it's nice, good quality fabric and wide and crop enough for my height (5'9) but are too thigh around the hips, I use large in every brand but the L in this pant fits me like an M<br />I recommend to size up"
4.0,"Great, fun shoelace to jazz up any of your shoes for your Orange-themed events!  Color is a bright, almost florescent orange with silver threading."
4.0,"This fit as expected, but only because I knew style ran small. Be warned, it is neoprene, not fabric and so it looks and feel different. A very cute cut in the top and the bottom. Flattering for sure. I'm full bottomed and smaller up top - a bit of a pear shape, but I found this suit to look cute on both halves of my bod. The top could be a smidge smaller for me, but hello, I'm not evenly proportioned. If you are like me, don't worry, this suit will fit. Typical Brazilian style full bottomed cut - smaller than the US idea of the same - low rise and very flattering. Not stretchy in the same way spandex is. Cute, and great quality for the price. No, it's not premium quality, but it's also not premium price. I have a lot of very expensive suits, which I also love, but this suit is a lot of bang for your buck, and sometimes it's good to have suits you wont die 1,000 deaths if they get ruined or go missing."
4.0,Not what my wife expected
4.0,Not as bright of pink as in photo. Mine was more like a pale pink top and clear bottom. I still like it though.
4.0,Little bit small
4.0,Me encant√≥ por su elasticidad y muy c√≥modo y me encant√≥ el color.
4.0,They are small and dainty. Which is perfect for me. Time will tell how well they hold up
4.0,The skirt is great and fits as expected.  Many compliments when wearing.  Only problem is zipper seems weak and gets &#34;stuck&#34;.
4.0,Worked better than an average sock. Daughter still pulled them off but can crawl without them coming off
4.0,I didn't realize they were linen but they are OK a little long but I'm short
4.0,They nice hurt at first buy after a lil bit u adjust
4.0,"Didn't know it runs large,could have ordered a smaller size.The color was very pretty and vivid, nice for warm weather."
4.0,"Very nice quality and material, just slightly too large. It's very stretchy so I would order down a size."
4.0,"While the headline says that this is a ""traditional"" dashiki, it is really more of a constume version of a dashiki.  The fabric is very thin and the gold design appears to be a lame' heat transfer aplique--but that's what I was expecting based on the photos and the cost.  In fact, I ordered this as a costume, so it suited my purposes perfectly.  But if you're looking for something traditional that would classify as clothing (rather than a costume), this is not for you.  I ordered a medium and it fit as expected."
4.0,This dress is very flattering and design is unique for 5‚Äù2 size 14 I went up to xxl<br />however the quality of the fabric is not to my liking. It‚Äôs not sheer though. Overall meh purchase in my opinion as this dress will look good in photos but will look cheap in person.
4.0,"This purse is really cute, and my daughter loved it! Unfortunately, the strap broke off. I would suggest only putting a few small things inside. Otherwise it is a great mini bag."
4.0,"I love huggie style earrings right now with all of the masks I have to wear.  No post in the back is a lot more comfortable with the mask straps.  I have several that are just the hoop or a hoop with some little zirconia inset into the hoop.  These have three circular adornments on the hoop that jingle against each other and spin around the hoop for some fun and a little sparkle.  I love the movement of them.  I just have to be very careful because none of them are attached the earring and they can slide right off.  Be careful when you are taking them off or putting them on that you don't loose what makes this huggie earring set special. Also, pay attention to the size because they are super small.  I like them this size but you may not."
4.0,Price was right. Color isn't that great and the fur does not look like the ad. But what I was worried about was the fit. It fits as expected.
4.0,These earrings are beautiful. Bought them for my daughter for Christmas. HOWEVER. They are extremely tiny.  Almost need a magnifying glass to see them
4.0,Ended a long sleeved golf shirt for under a golf jacket with zip off sleeves. Perfect and didn‚Äôt break the bank!
4.0,This was a perfect fit at 3XL. Loose comfortable and looks good.
4.0,Fits as expected.. had to adjust it so it want be moving g as much but overall nice
4.0,"Wonderfully packaged. Super fast delivery. Item exactly as seller described except that it is torn down the side of the nose, from the eye out the cheek. There was no option to exchange &amp; my grandson really wants the mask so we chose to not return the broken mask. The rip doesn't appear to have happened during shipping as it was wrapped in bubble wrap &amp; in the shipping box alone. We are going to buy some glue sticks &amp; hot glue it together. It's too bad because it is a beautiful mask. Very thick foam rubber. It fit's nicely &amp; looks great. Has quite a strong odor, but I'm sure that will fade &amp; air out. My Grandson collects masks &amp; he fell in love with this one. Looks like it will have to be one that is for display only. No videos or plays for this lone wolf! I received this product for free or discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Disclaimer"
4.0,"Loved the fit, however had to remove it in the wind and resort to a ball cap.  A big storm came up and the hat was gone for good.  Wish there was a can't lose the hat guarantee - bummed that this relatively expensive hat was mine for just a couple of weeks then a good storm took it away for good."
4.0,"Fits beautifully.  Very full skirt. Arrived in less that a,week."
4.0,"Really pretty dress,the fabric is soft,the only thing I don't like is that it's a little too big and loose so I'd probably recommend getting a size down because it's so flowy,but I can always put a cute belt around my waist to fix that so overall,really great for the price it's at<br />Update: I finally got to wear it for the first time and already broke it,I sat down and the straps aren't stretchy at all so I ended up pulling at the strap and breaking it instantly which made my subtract one star,don't know who to blame,me or the place that made it"
4.0,Ordered one size bigger after reading reviews. Fit great after that. Buttons were somewhat loose so will have to reinforce just a little but for the price the product was good. Shipping was quicker than estimated time.
4.0,"Now going to give it to my niece to use as well. She loves skulls too. Easy to regift, it lasted a long time."
4.0,"I love the shawl. I thought it was going to be a little longer on me, but I measured it and it is the size it says it is. I even received it quicker then expected!"
4.0,"for this price, there is nothing to complain, work great, matte color is cool. just it is not the real sun glass , it still have a lot of sun come through the glass.but ok for me"
4.0,They are a little smaller than I expected and a little hard to put in and close but maybe that'll get better with practice. Still wish they were a little bigger
4.0,Love these shorts! They're very comfortable. My skin can still breathe but they're not see through. My only issue was the pockets that are mentioned are not side pockets. They are small pockets on the waist. You may be able to fit a ChapStick tube or key in the pocket. Not a deal-breaker for me but I'd rather have larger pockets on the side.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace , I have had it for a month and it still glows"
4.0,This dress was perfect for a wedding I went to<br />The material is thick and it was very well made<br />Was a tad big on me but I made it work
4.0,"The only reason these did not get a 5-star rating, is because I could not get the wires out of their cradles on either earring. I had to take a very fine screwdriver and pry the clasp apart in order to open them."
4.0,It is good for the price. Fits as expected. the material is cheap but comfortable and it looks just like the picture. For the low price it works!
4.0,"Purchased for 6 year old son so he could wear during basketball camp. He loves them, says they are comfortable and claims they make him jump higher, lol!"
4.0,Loved the slippers!
4.0,It would be nice if you could pick the sizes for the rings most of them fit only on my pinky or ring finger!
4.0,"The buttons are far enough apart that if you move your body certain angles, you can see through the spaces under the onesie."
4.0,"This is still big enough for an adult to wear. Warm and we'll made, the pattern and color are vibrant. Don't  get if you want in 2 days."
4.0,"These slippers are so cute, I ordered yellow bunnies and my daughter, who is three and seven months old, loves them very much. These slippers are comfortable to wear, a little soft, the sole does not slip, and seems to have more friction in the presence of water. The suitability of these slippers is very strong, whether it is at home for leisure, taking a bath, going out to play, etc. It's just a little bit wide, and it's a little large for my daughter."
4.0,"I think I like my previous toiletry bag better because it had 2 plastic compartments that would protect against spills.  This one did not.  Otherwise, it was good."
4.0,"Nice quality for the price. However, they are itchy if you put them on your legs directly."
4.0,The dress as a whole is perfect it‚Äôs just tight in the bust I normally wear a medium but I ordered a large so I recommend ordering a size up
4.0,These feel real.  Only cautious because of warnings not to expose to water.
4.0,"Great style, great print, vivid colors."
4.0,"I love it as a longer tank top. No way I would wear it as a dress, although my husband would love it. It is a great fit as long as you are not looking for length."
4.0,"A Large of this shirt is about a small Gap/Old Navy. Very stretchy, but VERY tight."
4.0,"Very good looking pair of flip flops.  I wear them for long periods of time and they are really comfortable.  They are a bit stiff at first, but after the first couple of times they were easy to break in."
4.0,"I have a petite frame and wear size 34A so I ordered the small.  It fits very snugly, to the point that it is somewhat difficult to put on and even more so to take off!  I like that it fits tightly though because there‚Äôs no chance it will slide down or move whatsoever, and it isn‚Äôt tight to the point that it is uncomfortable.  I also like the padding and it provides a nice shape, unlike a lot of other strapless bras I‚Äôve owned.  Overall, considering the price and quick delivery, I am happy with it."
4.0,"Bought this for my husband. He loves it and wears it all the time since I got it. However, he did complain slightly about the sleeves being too short and tight at the shoulders. He is  5'9&#34; 185 lbs, I bought a large. But for the price it's a really great jacket. I recommend!"
4.0,Great size and colors!
4.0,Not work for the m2 frame.
4.0,Pretty good ear rings .... I just love them.... Only one thing bothers me is its small in size :(.... If they would have been little big .. I would have given five stars ...
4.0,This item I love the style of it and I was thinking about returning it but I think I will try to get some alterations done on it. The only thing that needs to be fixed is  that it is waaay too long. No matter what kind of heels I wear and I am 5' 4&#34;.
4.0,"Very very cute! Doesn't look cheap at all and I get compliments all the time. Love the green color, very classy. Has slots for cards, a pocket for your phone, and a zippered area with a keychain. I took off a star because the zipper doesn't work for me and so I am always nervous that my bag will fall over and everything will spill out. All in all, this is such a good deal. BUY THIS BAG"
4.0,"Looks like the picture, runs a little small.  I wish they sold the tops and bottoms separately.  The bottom was good, but the top was smaller than I would have liked."
4.0,I ordered my normal size which is an XL. It is a bit snug when I have a shirt underneath it. Still very cute and will still wear it. It does look nice. When I bought it I thought just the lace part in the front was see thorough but its actually the whole shirt.
4.0,Don't know why I ordered this little shirt.  I must have had something in mind.  Ha!!
4.0,To tall and big. I do have a large head.
4.0,THE WATCH BAND HAD ME CONFUSED AND THEN I PUT IT TOGETHER-JUST LIKE THE PHOTO
4.0,"I'm normally a medium, but the small fits me pretty darn well. The material is nice, and it looks much more expensive than it is. My only draw back is particular to me, as I have a long torso. This makes it fit differently than pictures, I don't get the slack that hangs over the waistband as shown. Otherwise, a great buy."
4.0,LOVE THESE! I am a size 11 so it is hard for me to find shoes that fit and these JUST make the cut. They are a little on the small side but otherwise- BUY THESE! You can tell that Frye has the best craftsmanship from the details in the boots to the smell of the leather.
4.0,Love the hat.  Price is steep for what you get though.  Used as a gift for summer interns who ground fish in a laboratory for their summer break.
4.0,"It was 10mm like it said, feels great, however I wish the ring closed a little closer to being a full ring. It's the right size, but I can see where the ring ends ,like it's not far enough in"
4.0,I bought several as I am using to hang hats as well as purses
4.0,Costume event
4.0,Pleased with these and the fit was good. They were made with a silky feeling material instead of a more flannel feel.
4.0,"Very nice racer back corduroy tops. Very stretchy and fit well. I machine wash mine in delicate cycle and line dry on a hanger. You get six of them in different colors. My only problem is that they aren't as thick as I hoped, but well worth it. They are long which is nice for when you bend down so there's no embarrassing reveals when your pants slide a little lower than you think."
4.0,I love the lining and that it's nice and thick.
4.0,"Great jacket. Looks sharp. Pockets are decorative only. Kind of lame because I‚Äôd rather put my keys and phone in my jacket than my pants. Fits slightly small, so if your shirts can be mistaken for a younger sibling I‚Äôd order one size up."
4.0,Fabric quality is a bit cheap for the price. But my daughter likes the style a lot. In stores we only see these in junior sizes but she's still in girls sizes so it was nice to be able to get the style she wants.
4.0,Pretty for the price. Matches with everything.
4.0,Color is slightly off from gold but not bad.  Trays were slightly scratched.
4.0,"This is a cute shirt! The dandelion graphic is cute and I love the shade of gray for the background color. The fabric is soft and comfortable and not sheer at all. It is a little bit big on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and with the shirt straightened fully, it goes past my butt, but I remedy that by using a hair tie to make a knot or bunching it up around my hips. Overall, it is a nice shirt."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my fiancee.  He loves it! Its well built and the pockets actually fit his cards (a feature some novelty wallets don't have). The starfleet delta is securely attached and the colors are true. His only complaint is that he wishes it had a few more pockets for cards.
4.0,Love this top... sheer and lace combo....goes great with a chiffon  dress...
4.0,Really good value!
4.0,"I purchased this belt and I like it, but it's rather stiff.  Maybe with time it will loosen up.  I would purchase from this vendor again."
4.0,"Great watch for the money. Looks great and keeps time. It takes a minute to learn the functions, but they work.<br />Only complaint is the cheap plastic band, but I replaced that inexpensively and now it's my go-to timepiece."
4.0,Case may be leather but tge lanyard is not
4.0,"This is a good casual top. The color is very pretty and I've been complemented on it when I've worn it. The shirring is in a nice position, covering any belly you may not want to show off!"
4.0,These feel good and soft actually when wearing.
4.0,"Great dress, just looked bad on me (fair with blonde hair)"
4.0,"It is a little larger than I expected, but it's nice"
4.0,"The neckline is much higher than what you see in the photo.  It seemed like the neckline was a bit more scooped.  Also, the very top and the arm openings don't seem to fit as expected.  But it is fine for what I wanted."
4.0,"Nice cap! However, it's not a Big Apple cap."
4.0,Nice quality and packaged very nicely. Seemed a little smaller than expected but they'll do
4.0,Extremely fitted. Like a lot.
4.0,"I'm 5 foot 1 135p. This did not work. Shipped back.  To long,  didn't like material. Gave it still 4 stars because it's not the sellers fault I'm petite."
4.0,Bracelet is beautiful it is on the small side so if you‚Äôre looking for  something larger this is not your pick..
4.0,Very good looking and confy but order a half number less than what you are in us. Because they run big.
4.0,"well made, just chose another style dress."
4.0,Got a hole by the zipper when trying to zip up the suit! Fit well though and people loved the costume! His the hole under the utility belt
4.0,I would suggest going up a size if you are curvy . I thought the dress would be longer but with my size it kept rising up . The fishnet stockings tore . I love the accessories and would purchase again .
4.0,"It‚Äôs a decent shirt. Design looks cool, especially for a Minecraft lover. This a size large and should fit my 7 year old boy great. One thing to note is the tag attached to the shirt in case you want to research your options. If you need the shirt in a pinch and don‚Äôt mind paying a little more, this is a good option. I‚Äôll be returning it since I was able to find it cheaper."
4.0,"Not a huge fan of the material, but looks cute and is comfy.  I ordered a M and im a 36B.  Its a bit loose, going to wear a cami to be safe."
4.0,"Great shirt, looks like the picture, came earlier than expected. Good buy."
4.0,This dress is super cute and runs true to size. However it is too long and I had to return.
4.0,"Overall I like the had, I feel very protective.  The only thing is the removable shield can get a bit foggy in the subways in NY during summer, which I expected. I would recommend it though, it covers my face down to my neck like in the picture. Good quality for the price."
4.0,For the price its effective and a good deal!
4.0,"The first time I tried it on, it fit great.  After I washed it (and hung dry), it still looked great, but seemed a little more stretched out in the top and hung down lower.  One of the pockets didn't lay flat either (even after ironing).  I still think it's cute, but was contemplating a smaller size."
4.0,"Decent quality, but runs small. The company was great though and took care of it. I do wish it had pockets."
4.0,This product could definitely fit non plus size or plus size women but I'm 5'6 and it's floor length!
4.0,"I love the length and flare to these, but the legs are a bit loose for my taste. The waist is mid-rise, which I really like. They are also flattering around the butt."
4.0,"Husband was thrilled to unwrap these pants at Christmas.  He likes to look nice, be comfortable,  and stay warm playing winter golf.  Price was reasonable,  quality seems good, and they washed well, too. Would buy again."
4.0,I would of gave these a 5 star but the paint on most of the charms wore chipped off.
4.0,"I love the colors of these masks, and I think they will look great with my tiki bar!<br />One of the masks was split down the middle when I opened the box, but that was the only issue, I glued it together and we'll see how long it lasts.<br />With shipping, you never know what happens, so it's not that big of a deal to me."
4.0,Super cute and was the right I was hoping to be.  I took the star away because the cat face embroidered already was fraying when I got it new in the box.
4.0,"The fabric feels great but there were some fit issues. I am 5'8"" 139lbs. The pants fit very comfortably in the thighs and butt which is hard for me to find but they are a little too roomy in the hips making me look bulkier in that area. Also because of the way the pants are colored there is a lot of attention drawn to the crotch which isn't super flattering.<br />I expected them to be longer but are pretty much the perfect length barefoot which makes them a bit short for my heels and boots.<br />However they fit much more true to size than I expected and except for some bunching around the hips which would no happen for someone with a little more curve they fit really well."
4.0,I am losing weight so I'm not sure if the fit is right or small. I love the suit.
4.0,It's  to small
4.0,"Legs fit like shorts for me even though it claims to fit people 6 foot tall, I'm only 5 10, the leg homes sit mid shin on me naturally,<br /><br />issue I have with all clothing, sleeves always  too short. This is no exception to that problem, great item otherwise  very comfy,"
4.0,"Was exactly what was pictured, showed up in a timely manner, nice shirt."
4.0,Cool gift for COD fans.
4.0,i liked this but the shirt isnt very long and slightly small and therefore didn't fit me the right way so I returned it
4.0,"Shirt was nice quality, and really soft. The neck line was higher than shown in the photo. I usually wear a large in juniors and a medium in women's. I ordered a large and it fit nicely. I did end up returning it because of the high neck line, but overall thought it was a nice shirt and will order from here again because of the great service."
4.0,I love this dress.. tried it on and im in love... BUT its slightly see threw im happy I have a black slip... because with a slip its perfect. I am 5 foot and its just above my knees.. which is what I was looking for. dress feels great hits my curves in the right spots..  but does need a slip. I will get more colors ( I got the blue one )
4.0,"The fabric is for summer time, but overall it‚Äôs ok"
4.0,Worked. Had fun with this
4.0,"excellent piece, but just see through enough that I wear a tight spaghetti strap top under it. Very hot design, washes well and dries sans wrinkles."
4.0,"Nice fit, works well with the long sleeve swim top. Perfect for water aerobics in winter."
4.0,"As expected, but bra hooks seem to get stuck in the weak part,of the fabric weave."
4.0,very supportive.
4.0,"I have slightly larger ear lobes, they fit nicely, although it didn't suit me so wouldn't be wearing them.But they hold nice, and look good."
4.0,"You have to get it exactly tight enough to stay in place without wrinkling, and its really hard to get the bow to sit well in the front. If you can get all that, it's really cute. It just takes me a few tries to get it right."
4.0,Slightly smaller in the arms than I anticipated but otherwise a great cardigan.  Light weight so great for fall weather.  I've received several compliments on this item.
4.0,"The color looked different from the display. Additionally, it fitted a little tight under the arms. But it looks good nonetheless..."
4.0,"Very cute, loved the colors. Well made for the price. The bottoms fit true to size and so did the top except for the cups. If you're a busty girl, it's not happening. I gave the top to my sister for this reason and she loves it."
4.0,My daughter loves this skirt!  Super cute on!<br />It's high waisted so it can be hard to take off but she doesn't mind.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable. It fits well. The only problem I have is that it's more of a midi than maxi length. I'm only 5' 5&#34; and it fits above my ankles. I was hoping for a long maxi length.
4.0,"Kinda long, but the boys loved them anyway!"
4.0,Great - you can use these sunglasses even when your prescription changes
4.0,"Gorgeous headband and perfect for the Roaring 20's party, however the elastic is a bit too tight."
4.0,Fit and colors
4.0,Was good quality for the price. Have very small wrists so had to really squeeze on it get it to fit.<br />Have not wore yet so don't know how well it will stay in place on my wrist.
4.0,Very nice rings for the price.
4.0,I loved how fast it came & it looked exactly like the picture . But what I didn‚Äôt like is how the sleeves are attached
4.0,It is a gift and delivery was very quick. It isn‚Äôt as long as I thought it would be but otherwise it‚Äôs fine. I know she‚Äôll like it.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:56c455562ce473f9d2e719920edc5b91]] Gotta install the back plate right side up and screw on screws very light. If you install it just right, the Watch works great and looks dope. Install it won‚Äôt it too tight and the watch doesn‚Äôt work."
4.0,"The color was true to the picture, a pretty emerald green. The material had a nice weight, it is a slick material with a shine. Detailing on the bust line is sewn in place. When I put it over my 38DD chest, the straps on the bust line wrinkled in an odd way."
4.0,"Snug fit, ok for casual wear, but in very cold, windy situations the wind just went right through the woven fabric. I ear these for style and wear my leather gloves for warmth."
4.0,It was as advertised and received as promised. All is well!
4.0,works with my note phone
4.0,"Really think this swimsuit is flattering. Size 36DD top, 32&#34; waist and it fits good. I had purchased before in purple but in a larger size. It stretched out quickly, but I loved the fit so much, I bought again. Even if it only lasts a year, it's a nice change. Works great for slimming bustlines that are larger."
4.0,"Definitely comfortable for the winter months ahead in Utah. Little bit looser than i hoped but, overall I'm happy."
4.0,"The necklace is on a thick, semi-masculine chain with a charm (a bit larger than a quater).  The charm being the tattoo/curse from Zero's neck (bloody rose).  I have worn it a few times - it gets quite a bit of attention, both from anime fans and non. Its made really well, and the vendor ships this product very quickly. I will say this, the chain likes to twist around, and the charm is a kind of sharp - but completely worth it!"
4.0,"First of all, I purchased these for a music video and they look incredibly amazing. However, you should be aware that these are way too dark, so you can't really see much with these on. Another thing is that I found them pressing too hard against my face even though I tried to adjust them to be more comfortable. But if you are going for the goth/glamour rock look, these are perfect!"
4.0,I like these very much they fit me well. It would be nice if the padding was a little thicker. Compared to my other bike shorts I get sore more quickly with these. But I like the versatility of being able to wear whatever I want over them as I use them as underwear under whatever I'm wearing to bike that day.
4.0,"Unique look. When people think you are wearing sneakers, you can get a couple of extra strokes."
4.0,"Much wider at the bottom, than I would imagine a &#34;straight leg&#34; fit would be. Otherwise perfect fit size."
4.0,The material isn't as nice as it look
4.0,This is a cute dress and fits nicely.  I will wear it a lot. Nice material.
4.0,"It's  a great trench coat, design, material all it's perfect but this is something what is created for short or petite woman."
4.0,Fit was great and character fit was great. Enjoyed wearing outfit to movies. Attention grabber.
4.0,"It is a cute pattern and a nice sized bag.  My bag was missing the shoulder strap, and the seller offered to send me out a new one."
4.0,Yes I like can I get this same hat I BLUE?
4.0,"it fits great, but the eyes are a bit too small to really see through easily, so keeping it on for awhile is not a good thing, considering that you lose all peripheral vision and your eyes won't work together, you bounce back between left and right eye depending on what direction you are looking at, so easy to give yourself a headache. It does get hot after a few minutes so again not something to wear for anything longer than maybe 5-10 mins until you need to get some air. I've become the person who just gets a mask for halloween and this did what I wanted it to do, but it didn't really glow in the dark like the miniature did."
4.0,"I bought this for my Samsung Gear 2 Neo. It has a very clean look to it. The band is not too heavy. The box ships with a tool to install the band. As for removing the links, I used a &#34;push-pin&#34; like you use on cork boards to remove the links. There are no instructions included in the box on how to remove them, but it is not hard. The pin that holds the link in place is flared on one end which holds it in place. Just use the push-pin to drive the pin out from the opposite side. As for the clasp, other reviews state that it does not hold. It will hold fine but you have to pinch it together with your fingers instead of flipping it closed on nicer watches. It is a good band for the price. The OEM band was horrible."
4.0,Fun slippers for the money
4.0,I LOVED the style of this dress! The material is not bad either! The only problem is that it's not true fit. It's my fault though as I didn't pay attention to the size chart. I'm medium but the dress fits more like small. So I'm going to try to give it another shot and order one size up.
4.0,"I did not give a perfect score on these as I have yet to wear them.  However, I did try them on upon receipt and they fit as expected.....MAYBE a little snug....and also they look exactly as they are presented online.  Same color, design, etc.  will update my review after I have had an opportunity to wear them."
4.0,This is a finely crafted leather key holder. Very smart looking with three good color choices. I would recommend this product.
4.0,"I took a bit of a gamble with ordering this dress and I was surprised at what I got! The dress is as pictured (albeit a little more flowy then seen here). There were some lace fringing at the ends but some scissors to trim off a little excess will fix that very quickly. The fabric is thin but nice and the dress is very pretty. One point I would like to clearly state is that the dress DOES run small. I expected this and ordered an extra large when I usually wear a medium to large size. I would highly recommend ordering this dress a size (or even two) up, especially if you're a little curvier and have a bigger chest. All in all a pretty good product."
4.0,"Fits good and comfortable. My last ride was 3 hours, no problems at all."
4.0,"I have not yet worn this outfit and have only tried it on. It feels very comfortable, stretchy and soft. I weigh around 186 pounds and ordered a large. A medium would have been more fitting but I personally wouldn‚Äôt have wanted it to be too tight. I gave four stars instead of five because the coloring is not the same. It came as blue, neon pink with hints of white instead of the blue and pink colors shown(which I like better). However, it‚Äôs not enough to make me send it back. I will be keeping it!"
4.0,"Great low price for a nice beanie!  It takes a bit of time for the package to make it to me.  But for the price, it is worth the wait."
4.0,Good quality. Fits perfect.
4.0,"Fits well. Only thing this thing can make you hot. Other than that, no complaints."
4.0,They're fantastic until you lose the back of one. The post is so thin that NO replacement post will fit. sigh.
4.0,I like the pockets! I wish it wasn‚Äôt so sheer that you can see the undershirt. Fits well.
4.0,My grandson loved the costume. Only thing not happy with the eyes wouldn‚Äôt stand up to floppy. But he looked cute in costume
4.0,This actually streches so no need to size up! They fit nice and hug your curves. Fabric is also very soft. I ordered a small size and it was perfect
4.0,I really love the earrings although some of the ear peaces where missing big very cute earrings üíï
4.0,My son's girlfriend loved this...very pretty!  Good value.
4.0,It is a bit hard to put the anchor through the hole but once you do it never comes off and it adds a nice touch to any outfit!
4.0,The bracelet is great. The link tool did not work well and broke within minutes.
4.0,good fit and I love the pop of blue!
4.0,Very nice thank you so much
4.0,GOOD QUALITY BUT SMALL FOR SIZE MARKED
4.0,This Pack has plenty of internal space.  The zippers and straps are strong and functional.  Shoulder straps are strong and adjustable.  Very comfortable to wear especially when using the waist belt.<br />There is also a bottom compartment for boots or shoes that can be closed off with a draw string.<br />It has 4 external storage pouches with strong zippers.  There is even a built in Rain cover in a separate zipper pouch.<br />Seems very strong and well built.  We'll see how it holds up to a hunting trip.
4.0,I love this dress. It's somewhat small in the bust.
4.0,"So cute!! I'm 5'5 and 118 pounds and this is a little small on me! I love the fit, but no way this is one size"
4.0,It‚Äôs bigger around the chest area and i‚Äô a 36D  also 5‚Äô6. Length was good loose around waist but a cute dress maybe i should of ordered a size down.
4.0,Add an extra millimeter or two between the conductors and it would be perfect.
4.0,"I really, really wanted this dress to work for me. The quality was great. Although, it did have a few spare threads on it. The dress is thick and fully lined. It did not work for me though. I have broad shoulders and do not like cap sleeves bc I feel like it makes my arms look broader. That is the way this dress looked. I LOVED the rest of the dress, but returned it because I knew I wouldn't wear it as often with the sleeve situation.<br /><br />I tried the long sleeve version next. I felt better in it, but the sizing was MUCH bigger than the short sleeve. I returned it also and may try to order it in a size smaller eventually. I do love the dress but grew tired of trying to find one that I loved."
4.0,Beautiful dress but way to long and runs big
4.0,"The softness of the product. Had to add, dud not notice until I put it on..  the neck trim was off. One side is dark blue, the other white. Disappointing!"
4.0,Cute functional. Though winding it up doesn't last very long.
4.0,"I ordered this Zeagoo Floral Lace top in black, size L. It arrived nicely packaged in a plastic wrap and had nice tags on it. The top has lace on the shoulders and the sleeve is also made of the same lace. The bodice is made of a 65% cotton 35% polyester t-shirt knit fabric. The lace feels completely synthetic.<br /><br /> When I first looked at the top, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the lace. Once I put the top on, the lace looked really nice, though. I can usually buy M or L (10-12) in tops and after reading through the reviews, I decided to order size L. The fit is close, but not too tight. The knit fabric has a good weight to it and doesn‚Äôt look see through. The lace is relatively dense for a lace and although you can see bra straps through it, they will not stand out (I‚Äôm wearing a nude bra in the pictures).<br /><br />  Now, the top I received had one seemingly small flaw, but the location of it makes the flaw huge. On every garment there‚Äôs a focal point. On a top like this, the focal point is going to be the front neckline. And that is where the problem is. The front neckline is asymmetrical in a way that looks flawed. I‚Äôm not sure how this top got through quality control, but it should not have been sent out like this. I will be taking this to my local tailor to have it corrected as that will be the only way to guarantee that I will have a wearable top to use within a few days.<br /><br />  So, this top arrived with a very noticeable flaw, but I still really like it. Once I have the flaw fixed, it will be a really nice top to wear with dress pants for a semi-formal occasion or just with jeans, when I want to dress up a little. I actually like this top so much that I‚Äôm considering ordering another one in another color."
4.0,"really cute socks! my baby boy loves them, though they fall really easily"
4.0,I can see my little one growing into them.
4.0,Dobre
4.0,Larger than I expected but not heavy.  Attractive & 3 pack offets color variety at about $3.00 a pair for sensitive ears.  Good deal for the money.
4.0,I have been buying these glasses for several years. They are great. I have a wide head and they fit fine without causing the glasses to spread
4.0,The quality of the dress is really good<br /> It was just a bit small. But I would love to order again if they had a 3x.
4.0,"The dress fits great, the only thing that bothers me is that it is bunched up in the back where the elastic is but I can get over it."
4.0,"These are very nice. The quality is good and they are sturdy. I will be wearing these often. One minor drawback: I prefer my cufflinks to come with a case, rather than in a logo'd bag."
4.0,Really liked the jersey. The material is soft and breathable. One problem was the sleeves were too fitted.  I had to reorder a bigger size.
4.0,"This is a good, basic bag for dance or gymnastics. We bought the dark pink and it's a nice color with the black. My daughter is in preschool, so she doesn't need to carry much to her class - this bag is the right size for her different shoes and a water bottle. The adjustable strap also allows her to wear it on her shoulder or across her body. The reason I deducted a star from the review is the bottom shoe compartment is VERY small. Only ballet shoes can fit in there, so it is barely worth having a separate compartment for shoes. I wish that compartment was bigger (taller) or there was an internal separator or other feature for shoes."
4.0,This shirt is very soft and comfortable. I really do love it but it is very long and way bigger than expected. It is form fitting which I think helps but I shouldn't have up sized at all. In fact I probably could've gotta by with a small.  I still wear it quite often. Have tried to shrink it up some in the dryer but it didn't seem to help.
4.0,"I love the colors.  The material and workmanship are acceptable.  I like my cycling outfits to fit snugly, so I should have bought the L instead of the XL.  However, I was basing my decision on a similar product purchased recently, also manufactured in China.  Check the comments carefully as the sizing is not consistent between different Chinese manufacturers."
4.0,Nice shirt for the price! Its a little thin but you cant tell if your undergarments are the same color as the shirt. I've worn it on camera and on camera it looks like a well made quality shirt.
4.0,"I‚Äôm Older, looked very young.<br />So I returned it"
4.0,"This dress is very cute. It is a little longer than expected and similar to other reviews, the top part is very sheer. But I‚Äôm going to wear a bandeau with it and it is fine. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and about 230 pounds. I usually wear an XXL. The bust is too big for me as well (I‚Äôm a 40DD). But overall I love it. And the other reviews were very accurate. It is quite breathable."
4.0,"This is as described and I have one complaint. I bought 2 colors of these. My wife and I tried them on several ways and wore them around the house for a while the day they came in. A bit later I noticed one of our cats playing with something. All but one of the large tassels had fallen off of both of these. while it's really inconsequential, REALLY?"
4.0,"Wife likes it, says it‚Äôs a little tight, but, she likes it"
4.0,Loved the fit. Got plenty of compliments.
4.0,I loved it but my 5 year old daughter said it was itchy in the back. I would recommend 1 size bigger. I washed it & air dry.
4.0,"There eye masks do the job and are well constructed. The only reason I knocked off a star is that the curvature of the eye cups is not deep enough for me. I'm a night shift nurse and have to have an eye mask to sleep during the daytime...I like it pitch black. In order to block out all the light around the edges, I have to velcro it a little tighter on my head which flattens out the mask a tad. When I open my eyes with the mask on, my lashes brush the interior. Minor thing but when you HAVE to get great sleep and are a light sleeper, that minor little thing can wake you up enough to be annoying. That being said, I usually buy the 40 Blinks brand and comparatively, this mask seems to be superior in construction. It's been several months and the interior lining is not peeling up at all on me, which usually happens and signals immediate replacement for me. :) I think this is overall a great deal for the price. I do not use the earplugs but they seem pretty standard. I would recommend this sleep mask bundle to others."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt expect it to be so small
4.0,My wife loves this dress especially at the beach
4.0,Love it  I won u pd buy more but keep a hot glue gun ready you get what you pay for.
4.0,"Packaging was horrible, clothes were stuffed in some kind of zip lock bag and the bag was open so the clothes were basically half way out of the bag just sitting in the box that also had make up that I ordered. Thank god nothing opened and spilled onto it. Otherwise great quality for the price. Ordering a bigger size though."
4.0,not breathable material so you might get sweaty
4.0,"Great fabric, but I would suggest going one size smaller."
4.0,"These sunglasses are very comfortable, probably the most comfortable I have ever worn.  My only problem with them and this is my fault is that in the photo they look a lighter shade of rose than they really are.  I have to wear rose colored glasses for five weeks as physical therapy so I was hoping these sunglasses were comfortable and a light enough shade of rose to be worn indoors at all times.  They are a deep rose tint instead of a light rose tint so I will just have to use them as driving sunglasses."
4.0,"Quality isn't amazing but the hat is great for the price! Fits well, decent design."
4.0,I am going to Florida soon and was glad to find these - ordered 4 in different colors and prints. Ordered XL.  Arm holes just right.  I am 40DD nothing clings.  Hides my tummy.
4.0,"Box was completely crushed and this was a gift, so that was a small disappointment. The scarf itself is beautiful."
4.0,So these are listed as 3.0 lenses but they came labeled as 2.0 the good news is that they fit the frame. The quality seems pretty good but once they are field tested I‚Äôll have an updated review.
4.0,Very cute!! Stylish and flattering. Can be styled in so many different ways. Definitely recommend. Top doesn‚Äôt have a lot of give so size up if you want it looser.
4.0,This gloves are nothing fancy. They're thin and don't really fit properly. But they are the right price and totally adequate for my uses. I will buy them again.
4.0,Considered returning nowhere near the size I was expecting but after a day I love it! It's actually perfect size and hold ALOT!!
4.0,Could always be happier!
4.0,This sweater is VERY well made. I absolutely love it. I gave it 4/5 because it‚Äôs GINORMOUS. It‚Äôs more than oversized for sure. It‚Äôs triple For what ‚Äúoversized‚Äù should be. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù about 130 lbs and it drowns me. The small looks like I purchased an XXXL sweater. Definitely size down if you can.
4.0,"The watch band is not easily adjustable by the consumer.  If you are buying a watch on-line, there should be instructions included with the watch or available from the vendor or manufacturer on-line.  If your wrist has a 7 3/4 to 8 1/4 inch circumference, the watch would probably be good for you."
4.0,Good material. Good fitting
4.0,"I bought one for hallowen to be a quick work costume and decided that for the price they're great, quick and easily coordinate with a jacket or sweater. I bought three more. comfy and cute, and -- did I mention it has pockets?"
4.0,My grandson loves it.  Wears it when playing golf.
4.0,I have a few of these dresses and they are great. The only time i was disappointed was the dress I just received I thought it was going to be a mustard yellow like a darker yellow but it turned out to be a banana yellow/ crayola crayon yellow ...not what I was looking for.
4.0,The color is a bit more bright that on the picture
4.0,i love it but unfortunately the front rolls back
4.0,"It was a tad large, but it looks prettier than the picture. It looks great with jeans and dressy casual with navy or black slacks."
4.0,I don't think I'd have purchased these socks if the description correctly noted &#34;Do NOT tumble Dry&#34;  (aka air dry only).
4.0,Bought two of these. one for me and one for my little girl to help her go through the transition of starting school and being away from me. Really helped.  The chain is pretty cheap and broke but the pendant is pretty and not too big but big enough to be able to put a photo in.
4.0,"I love this dress. Be aware that the colors, particularly the blue, are very bright."
4.0,Very nice‚ù£Ô∏è
4.0,It was for my 12yr old daughter - she loves it! She is wearing it during her 6th grade graduation ceremony.
4.0,"wife loves it, carries it every day with her new purse"
4.0,"This lanyard is super cool and super cute and I love it, however, the little hook and key attachment piece it comes with is flimsy and broke in a couple days. Luckily I had a sturdier lanyard that I was able to salvage parts from to make this lanyard stronger."
4.0,"Cool necklace, but it took a while to arrive"
4.0,Had some glasses from the days of AOL! These are great improvement and  at a reasonable price.
4.0,Its hard to know what size when ordering online. I ordered xl but was way big. It is a cute top though and I like the under the arm coverage
4.0,"Liked the fit and style, runs small."
4.0,"really like this purse, room for all my things"
4.0,Kept my hands warm. A little big and you still can't text with them that well ..still good though!
4.0,nice quality but...runs big.  I'm  a size 0-2 ans a small is too loose.
4.0,"I am a small woman and everything for my head is too big...hats, glasses, head sets. So I was happy to see this product was recommended for small women. It is, however, just a bit snug. I hope with use it will loosen up a bit so I don't get a headache."
4.0,"Not the Original Rainbow loom bands, but the quality is good enough for making leprechauns!"
4.0,This actually was an accurate fit
4.0,Short length but I was expecting that anyway. I can wear a long cami underneath and it looks nice! I usually wear 4x and 5x. I'm 370lbs. Nice feeling fabric.
4.0,"Nice color, nice fabric but the style was not becoming to me at all.  Not the fault of the dress!!"
4.0,It was really cool and i will use it next year but the anti fog wipes work for less than 5m and it gets super duper hot and foggy as well as the pad it didnt stick for all three but other than that i was out for 2h and it took about 2 percent off the battery it was bright worked fine and is perfect for a decorative item as well.
4.0,"Good quality. Bought 4 as gifts but did not like that on the heart charm attached &#34;stainless steel&#34; was stamped across the heart on one side, they could have attached a small tag indicating this. Otherwise nice looking bracelet."
4.0,Not bad for the price but wore fleece liner gloves under these & still needed hand warmers in AK minus -15 deg weather at night.  Never had to try the waterproofing
4.0,Nice jacket for cold weather. Cold to us around here isn't as cold as some places. I wouldn't wear it in freezing temps all dat but for a quick walk to the car it'll be fine. Seems made well. Packaged well. So far it appears to be well made too
4.0,It's a great piece for the price..
4.0,"Nice as in the picture i thought they were even lighter but it's ok, i can wear them even if i have to wear extremely light earrings."
4.0,These are indeed junior sizes. I am 5'11 and usually a size 12/14. I ordered size large and they are very fitted which is what I wanted. They go all they way up to the armpit and are nice and long. The straps are adjustable but a bit thinner than I prefer. They do dig in unless you loosen the straps. Nice soft cotton material.
4.0,"It is comfortable and well made. I was expecting real rhinestones but they were not real, just part of the illustrations."
4.0,They fit well. They are comfortable as well.
4.0,"I've long envied my wife's squall parka.  I've had the expedition down parka for many years, and that is very warm but too bulky to wear while driving.  I also have the squall jacket which is handy but not quite warm enough for the coldest weather.  Now, finally, I have my own squall parka.  Great in the cold rain or sleet with its hood, or very cold weather worn with a ski hat and a fleece pullover underneath.  Great that it's machine washable and can be had on sale at very deep discounts from an already modest price.  The zipper is indeed balky zipping on and off, and that is an annoyance, but not fatal.  Edit: With repeated use, the zipper now works smoothly."
4.0,I love the style of this and I‚Äôm actually on my second one! Only issue is that my cards sometimes fall out. Fits my phone too!
4.0,"I really loved the set when I saw the picture but I was curious to see what ppl were saying. Glad I did! This set runs extremely small. I'm normally an XS in Size and I ordered the Large. It fits me barely. I loved the fabric, is really shift and comfortable. The print is great, it really gets what I was looking for."
4.0,The fit is prefect.  My problem is that the color is a lighter blue that what is shown on the picture.
4.0,"Bought the glasses for a costume; they were a hit even though I wouldn't reuse them. Lenses are slightly curved so they will slightly affect vision.<br /><br />The carrying case with it is a triangular eyeglass case that collapses to be completely flat, though, and is worth the purchase alone. Compare the case with this product:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Foldable-Glasses-Eyewear-Sunglasses-Magnetic/dp/B075DYK5TN/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1506981104&sr=8-5&keywords=folding+eyeglass+case<br /><br />I've since tossed the glasses and kept the case."
4.0,"It really is a beautiful necklace but did come in broken and missing some stones. I'll still wear it to my military ball, but will have to fix/glue a few pieces together."
4.0,"I really like it, very classy looking.  I have such a small wrist, so I do wish it came in an x-tra small size."
4.0,The currency moves around a little bit but that doesn't bother me.  So far it's doing its job. I would rather the bills be in this than sitting in an evelope.
4.0,"After reading reviews I decided to go with a large. I'm short so I didnt want it to be to long. I'm 4'11 around 170 with a bust of 40ddd. I only have a couple issues with it... it's a little tight in the arm area and the cuffs are a tad short. If you look in my photo one cuff comes up a bit when I bend my arm. I'm not sure if that hole was there upon delivery (I didn't notice it) or if that happened in the wash (I wash all my clothes before wearing). It was kinda a let down, but good thing it's on the inside where no one can see. The material is somewhat thin and light. It's perfect for the office or slight cold weather. I love the pockets! Very handy and Spacious. I also bought the black one."
4.0,The skirt's color is true to the image. The length is a bit too long but then again I am 5'5... A down side for this skirt is the fact that the hems started to become undone after the first wash.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is a medium and 5'2"" tall. It fit her very well and was the perfect length. It touches her ankles. The front is designed to be a little bit shorter. She is 5 months pregnant and there is still room for her belly to grow. I gave it a four because it came as black with red dots but I ordered black with white dots. Its still cute but really mini mouse-ish. It is flattering, a bit stretchy, very flowy and not at all sheer. The straps are also adjustable. A really nice dress that can be used for pregnancy and post pregnancy."
4.0,Great product. I was very pleased with the item when I received it. It looks very good and is still pretty slim with all my cards inside of it. I do wish it could be a little slimmer but its still very light in my pocket and I hardly feel it most of the time. One feature of the wallet that I really like it the flip out id holder its very convenient to be able to just flip out my ID whenever its needed. Over all my opinion on this wallet is that is a great quality wallet and a decent price.
4.0,4.5 stars. Super fast shipping and it's beautiful. &#60;/3
4.0,Love it! Great quality and fits beautifully.
4.0,Bought for staging for house sale.  Does the trick.
4.0,Does not show up in the dark as well as advertised
4.0,"Wish I had this dress when I was 5 pounds lighter, but it is still flattering."
4.0,"I own a lot of Grace Karin skirts. This one is fine, but it's really not my favorite. The scalloped waist really throws it off for me. I do wear my tops tucked in, and am very thin, but it still isn't the most flattering. I do love the color, and the pattern. It was a great wardrobe addition especially during the festive holiday months, but I really doubt it would be one of my go-to skirts. It does fit on the larger side, but the included belt allows some flexibility there that you wouldn't have with just the side zipper."
4.0,"I thought it would run small and it did, I bought a larger size in case and I'm glad I did. My daughter did like it very much! The jacket is very light and perfect for Florida weather."
4.0,"It's very soft and warm.  Very wide, but more importantly to me, it is long enough so that I can tie it in a particular pattern around my neck blocking cold air.  Very reasonable price.  I chose red because I have a black coat, and on wintery days, I feel that a pedestrian isn't that visible, so a splash of red is a safety factor.  Update:  I changed it to four stars because sadly it sheds like your favorite dog!  I have bits of red all over my fabric car seats and on my gloves.  I don't really understand why it is happening....."
4.0,Good quality plastic insert. I ordered one and the company sent me a second one free. Very satisfied.
4.0,"Great for a workout, I bought it because I have to wear a tank under my scrubs. It keeps rolling up not matter what I do. I‚Äôm a caregiver so I can‚Äôt be constantly unrolling my undershirt. Otherwise I love them."
4.0,Glasses are topnotch. Great for sun glare and keeping your eyes protected.
4.0,Very comfy and well made.
4.0,"The jacket is cute. The color is pretty much exactly like the picture, the fabric is soft and feels great. Only complaint is that the size runs a little big and that maybe be due to trying to fit multiple age ranges, but I will definitely be keeping it for when my son can fit it properly"
4.0,I gave a 4 stars due to the fact they fit really loose. Could just be my arms. I was just expecting a tighter fit. But as far as quality goes. They are great. If you have bigger wrists and forearms. They will fit perfectly.
4.0,"I began using handkerchiefs in place of facial tissue this year and have purchased many different brands.  These are definitely not the softest I have purchased, but they are absorbent.  I wish they came in a smaller size because I like to keep them in my pockets, and as we all know, manufacturers rarely make women's pockets big enough to fit anything.  I purchased the hankies described as ""black,"" but they are definitely navy, not black."
4.0,"Cute, big, shiny, & super Inexpensive."
4.0,"Not what I expected, it is little and round, not oval. And I couldn't read what it said. It was still a great gift tho and my daughter wears it everywhere. I'm giving it a 4 because it was worth the money for sure!"
4.0,i liked the way they were made wish i could wear them
4.0,Big around the top so I think water might get inside and wish I got a size smaller but good quality overall.
4.0,"I like this dress for every day wear. I wish the cotton was little thicker. It was hard to find a bra that wasn‚Äôt seen through the breast area, but if I would have sized up, the dress would have been huge."
4.0,Great look....clasp can be a problem keeping closed when putting your hand in pocket.
4.0,"Overall the headbands were good, but when I opened the bag it smelled of vinegar. It did have good packaging and good quality though. It also had rubber gripping that made my head itch."
4.0,large around the waist
4.0,"There is no way to connect the hoody to the jacket, so you always have to button up both. There is also no drawstring on the hooded part, but I guess that‚Äôs what the little black strings on the jacket part are for. The last button on the hooded part doesn‚Äôt go all the way to the bottom. The pockets on the jacket part are not real, which makes no sense to me. Why make a fake pocket? Lol, I don‚Äôt like that at all. For the price, they could have added real pockets. Hopefully you‚Äôre wearing pants or have a purse. I ordered a 6/8,  but the tag says XL and it‚Äôs bigger than what I wanted. If the clothes have a size on them, I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt just use those sizes. I live in California, so I feel this jacket will be decent when it‚Äôs cold, but people wearing this to stay warm... don‚Äôt. You‚Äôll be cold. The material on the hooded part feels nice and if you ever just want to wear that part with no sleeves, you can. I just wish there was a way to connect the two, so I don‚Äôt have to button up both every single time... and I need those pockets to be real. I‚Äôm pretty upset about those pockets, lol. What will I put my hands in?!"
4.0,They're cool but they are massive. You have to have huge boobs for them to sit correctly I assume.
4.0,I was hoping that is was a wide as another bag that I have but it is not. The design is nice and it will be fine for what I need it for.not as wide as i thought. Rather narrow.
4.0,Pretty bracelet for the price!
4.0,"I had a similar Casio for decades - almost identical in appearance but with four buttons.  This version is okay but not a good as the older version in the following respects:<br />1) There is no month displayed.  Day of week and day of month, but not the month itself, despite there being room on the display.  The month has to be set, but is not displayed.  Disappointing.<br />2) The older version had the button to enter settings mode recessed, so it required a deliberate action to enter the settings.  The button on this version is not recessed, so it is way too easy to accidentally enter the settings mode and change something unintentionally.<br />3) The wrist band does not appear to be removable, despite the appearance of pins at the joint.  I was hoping to replace the band with my older flex band, but could not get the existing one off.  The band on this version is not bad, just not as convenient for me as the flex band I had."
4.0,Very cute outfit that I bought for my mom but the pants ran very large.
4.0,"As many others have mentioned these shirts fit almost a full size large.  Glad I noticed that before ordering.  Nice weight and perfect color match.  Worth the price, but not the best you can buy."
4.0,"This outfit worked great for my cosplay but I did have some pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Spot on with the character outfit, plus came with pretty much all items needed<br />- Skirt pleats were perfect, usually those come all messed up with the stitching looking bad<br />- The top was pretty nice material, kept me cool while also keeping me warm when it got dark out, was easy to roll the sleeves and tie the bottom of the shirt as well<br />- The tie was great, it was folded so it had a crease but it didn‚Äôt bother me<br />- Shipped SUPER FAST which I needed due to a last minute cosplay<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The socks were cheaply made although they were the right length<br />- The top is a tad bit see through but I fixed this easily with a white tank top underneath<br />- The shirt was a bit longer than Kitagawa wears, I just rolled it up a bit to make it look right<br />- My #1 CON is the necklace. It was too long for it to be used as a choker necklace and there was only one button option so if it had more buttons for making it a smaller fit it would have been perfect. Luckily, I had my own buttons I use for when clothes are too big on me and cut off the original button to use my own.<br /><br />Overall, happy with this outfit and very glad it came with all the items! There were some fixes to do but nothing I couldn‚Äôt manage plus it shipped fast and that was what I needed most :)"
4.0,solid chain. Color is a bit artificial
4.0,"Unfortunately the size was bigger than the normal sizes small and medium, but the quality of the material was really nice. I would order a size smaller than your normal size."
4.0,"I like this dress; a little shorter than I like but I do have an ample booty.  The material is very thin.  for this price, you cannot expect luxury material but it would be nice if you could't see white bra and panties through it."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt like how the shirt collar fits . It‚Äôs so big that my sports bra straps show on both sides . I wasn‚Äôt a fan of that but the rest of the shirt fit as expected .
4.0,They look just like in the picture.
4.0,Very comfortable with great cushioning. Tricky to keep on when on stairs.
4.0,"My nose is super sensitive to surgical steel so I needed a titanium ring. Not 100% sure that the ring is pure titanium but my piercing hasn't flared up as much as before. They even included a free gift along with the package, which was a small L-bend nose stud with a diamond. It was an amazing surprise, so thank you!"
4.0,I really like Franco Sarto boots. I do wish that when it said the upper stretched a bit there was actually a part that was stretchy.<br />A bit expensive for man made materials.
4.0,Worked well with the leotard
4.0,"I like these but my son hates them. He fusses and is constantly trying to pry them off. However, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the actual shoes. They are well made and not heavy or chunky like most of they boys shoes on the market."
4.0,Fits good looks just like it is on the picture
4.0,"For a $5 hat you are getting a very cute, well-received hat. Its a little on the large size but I thought it made the hat look a little on the bohemian side. Besides that, the hat took well over a month to get here, which is really the only negative I found. For the price you are paying, it is a good purchase."
4.0,"I bought this necklace for a friend as a birthday gift. It is a nice, simple piece that goes with anything. It doesn't look cheap but at the same time there is no &#34;bling&#34; to it at all. It makes a statement without a lot of flash."
4.0,Very warm.  It could do without the leather accents.  It cheapens the look a bit.
4.0,The vest is a nice quality knit.Fits well.My only complaint is the color of the buttons.They looked more white in the pic but are tan and brown.
4.0,Super adorable but gave 4 stars because I can't wear them... Pretty sure the ones I received are a full size bigger than what I ordered. Now debating on whether to stretch up again so I can wear them lol
4.0,"This fitted very well, it's a little thin but it will be perfect for the summer."
4.0,"Too large, thought they looked smaller"
4.0,It doesn't stick well enough. I can't figure out how to wear it correctly (with no air bubbles or bumps) and it doesn't stay in position.<br />Update: shortly after my review the seller contacted me offering a partial refund. The 4 stars are for their excellent costumer service.
4.0,They should adjust size.  Baby wears 0-3 month and these still don't fit her.
4.0,"The zippered sides are great, means I can tie them and leave them tied. Order a good set of insoles to go with them, whatever is in them is thin and the soles are hard. They also run a little large and thick insoles will help with that. Since I got these to go with a Halloween costume they‚Äôll work perfectly since I won‚Äôt have them on for a long period of time."
4.0,"I bought 3 of these dressed to get the correct size. First I got the XL and it was too big. Then I got the medium, thinking it would be more appropriate since the XL was SO baggy. The arms were tight, but the dress fit well. Then I ordered the large, thinking it would be the perfect size, but it was too baggy also! So I ended up wearing the medium with the very-tight sleeves. I have yet to return the two that didn't work out!"
4.0,Blue is not as intense as in the pictures. I should've known better. It spins quite smoothly though.
4.0,"This pendant is a nice weight of solid silver and jade. It has the sold weight & feel of a well made, quality piece of jewelry. As far as the color - well - it is JADE GREEN. It is the nice dark green that most people associate with jade. It is a color of green that can be used as a neutral. I think you can wear this color with almost every other color.<br />The cord goes with the pendant but doesn‚Äôt match the color of the jade exactly. I have this in three different gem colors and paid more for just the pendant with no cord included. Throw the cord away if you don‚Äôt like it! Consider it a free gift with purchase. I wear my pendant on a black or tan cord that I already had, a beaded necklace (enhancer goes over beads and pearl type necklaces perfectly) and on silver or stainless steel chains from 18 - 36 inches and it looks great on them all.<br />This deep green jade enhancer is worth the price all on its own."
4.0,I thought the bill was a tad too long but other than that it fits great and at the price is perfect.
4.0,"These sunglasses look nice and work fine. They have comfortable silicon nose pads which I like. I would prefer darker tinting, but the tinting is just like it appears in the pictures which I appreciate. I would prefer spring hinges, but these are a good deal for the price. I was surprised they came with a gift box, hard case, soft case (cloth bag), and a warranty."
4.0,Cute and VERY comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 135 and I ordered a medium. The fit is good. Under the arms is a little looser than I‚Äôd like. I had to wear a bralette underneath.
4.0,They are smaller than I expected
4.0,I really liked the earrings. One of them was broken when I opened the package. But I glued it back together. Can't wait to wear them.
4.0,"So, it's not a sweater. It's more of a waffle knit t shirt kinds like the thermals of the 90s..... BUT it's really cute and super comfortable and I am not disappointed."
4.0,Very cute and arrived quickly!
4.0,This shirt fits pretty well but a little big on width and the length was pretty short on me. Im 5'8 with a long torso. Someone shorter could probably have the longer lenth like in the picture.
4.0,So Far ggod
4.0,Love this 2 piece set! I ordered white but it is more of a silver color due to the amount of sparkles but it's still very pretty! I ordered a size S when I am usually a M. I'm 5'2 137lbs if that helps anyone. The top fits perfect but the band on both the top and bottom are a little tight so I could have gone with a M but I love the fit regardless and it's not too tight to where it is uncomfortable. I'll be wearing it for my trip to ATL.
4.0,"I've tried many non prescription compression socks as I wear these because of a DVT in my leg. These are by far the most comfortable. I am also a runner so I've always worn compression socks, I do like these the best. PS: My last purchase was supposed to be buy 3 get one free. I never got the free pair..."
4.0,"Beautiful mask, but was heavier than expected."
4.0,I like the style the only thing is the Large kind of XL to me but wearable.
4.0,Shirt and design are as expected. The top portion of the shirt fits great - I wish I would have sized up one - I‚Äôm not a fan of clingy around my mid section. Still wearable and I don‚Äôt look like a sausage. I‚Äôll get some good wears.
4.0,"Wasn't expected there were four hooks on the back and bottom band tends to roll up a little, but the sizing is about right and for the price, it is what I expected them to do as sleep bra."
4.0,My fault for not looking at the dimensions
4.0,Length differences from sides to front and back isn‚Äôt quite as drastic as pictures
4.0,Fit great but the bottoms were just a wee bit small
4.0,The sleeves don‚Äôt go all the way to my wrist but it‚Äôs still a great suit
4.0,It's a pretty dress but wasn't for me. Not fancy enough.
4.0,"I received this top in the denim blue color, and I quite like it.  The fabric is soft and flowy and covers a multitude of flaws. The top is very comfortable to wear, though when it is hot and humid outside, it isn't very breathable as the fabric and traps the sweat.  The actual color isn't as light blue as it is in the picture on the listing. It still falls in the blue family, but it's more of a blue-grey in real life. Care is pretty straightforward - wash on cold, hang to dry. I've not had any issues with wrinkles so far, either when it's hung to dry or while wearing. The crochet detail around the neckline is pretty, though be wary of snags.  I am 5'6"" and find the length to be fine as the hem falls below my waist and when I lift my arms my tummy isn't exposed. The arm openings could be a little smaller. Depending on the bra you wear and where the band sits under your armpits, it might be flashed when you raise your arms. This top does indeed run big by close to a full size, so if you would like it to be more fitted than flowy, order a size down."
4.0,seems nice
4.0,I love these stylish quality earrings! I changed the backing out to my preference type of backing but the earrings are sparkly and gorgeous!
4.0,"I‚Äôve taken this thing 1,000‚Äôs of miles thru snow, ice, mountains, and deserts. I treat this bag like I didn‚Äôt pay for it. Not a tear or a blemish. Tough as nails. Does start to fade after a wash or two."
4.0,"works fine, okay for the money"
4.0,"Soft, cozy but slip slightly when I walk. Also a bit bulky."
4.0,Perfect fit for my 10 year old. He loves it!
4.0,"Super cute! I got a small. I normally wear a S/M top and 6/8 bottoms, and it fits perfect! The fabric is a little cheap and thin, but it‚Äôs not see-through and for the price, it‚Äôs sort of expected. Just know that it‚Äôs not high quality!"
4.0,This is the second one ordered. I liked it so well the first time that I reorder it after giving the first one to my niece after she admired it.
4.0,"my daughter really likes this suit because paired with swim shorts it covers her well, which is what she wanted. it is a tiny bit see through but not bad.  She wears a size 16 in womens and we ordered an XL which fit well. It does come with bra padding inside but she still wore a bra underneath because it did not feel totally supportive, but that could just be a personal preference, it would probably work ok for most people."
4.0,"Perfect find. My husband lost his and this was perfect to find that he can replace this without buying the whole watch again. However, its expensive for something so simple."
4.0,"Floral colors aren't as vibrant as pictured, and the bottom of the dress is a bit thin.  Otherwise it is a good buy.  I bought XL and I wear a 16 Petite.  Size is on point."
4.0,Fits really cute and is comfortable!
4.0,This leggings feel great and fit well. My only complaint is that they attract lint so easily.
4.0,"Nice, and oversized. This item fits great. I got a medium, which is my regular size, and this fits nicely. It‚Äôs a nice oversized sweater. I tried it on when it was delivered, and I was scared that it might be itchy. After washing it, I was able to wear it all day at work and it was not itchy at all. I think it‚Äôs a nice layering sweater, but if it‚Äôs really cold outside, you‚Äôll definitely want to add other layers to keep you warm."
4.0,I loved it but they didn‚Äôt have directions as to how to use it!
4.0,"Para ir a la iglesia, o alg√∫n lugar familiar.."
4.0,"Looked sturdy, only docked a point because I misread the label and bought the wrong watch band. So I don‚Äôt know how sturdy it really is"
4.0,for tho price it is a nice bikini.
4.0,Just be careful to angle the front of the bar back a little when sliding on so you don't snag the tie.  The front corners are pretty sharp. Worn weekly by 2 young boys under age 10 and they are perfect.
4.0,Great !! According to my expectations !! Tks
4.0,The outfit fit perfectly on my daughter and she loves everything about it. ... Thanks a lot!
4.0,"These keep your hands very warm, but the length of the wrist area is a little shorter than I would like for large hands."
4.0,Bought for my mother in law. She loved it.
4.0,Gave this as a gift to my 25 year old son. He loves the belt. The  ratchet system works really well and in fact was found very intriguing.<br />The only reason not 5 stars was that the styling of the actual belt is lacking. The end is a sewn square end that does not have a very finished quality to it.
4.0,Shorter than expected but sleeves are billowy
4.0,For great looks beautiful
4.0,Very nice runs big !!! Went down in size but should have went down 2 sizes for my daughter. That being said she can grow into it.
4.0,"This was the best deal I found for microfiber lens pouches. You get two for about 5 dollars plus free shipping! They seem to be of good quality. Be aware that they are plenty large, in fact almost too much so for my needs. They could easily accomodate goggles and very large eyewear. I'm using them to protect my sunglasses and as a low-profile case for my digital camera on a trip to africa. There is much excess fabric after storing the items, but I can fold it over, and I plan to make use of them anyway. The plastic cord-stop may be irritating for some people, but that can be removed. All in all, excellent for the price, and large enough to be plenty versatile"
4.0,I haven't used it yet but it looks good.
4.0,"Beautiful product, great for formal or casual wear great quality material<br />only con: it does shed white fibers a little bit"
4.0,"This short romper is very nice, cool and comfy. I give it 4 stars because when you wash it, it seems to create a little mot kinda little balls on the material. I like them. The colors are very nice!"
4.0,"I ordered a size up because of other reviews about it being small. This size fit well. I ordered the green even though another reviewer comolained about the color not being bright like in the picture. She was right, it is not a bright grass green. It is more faded...not quite minty...a hard to describe color.  I am still okay with it as i was not trying to match anything particular. The cardigan is a soft knit material and seems to be of okay quality for the price."
4.0,Cute but not a good variety of items. Got mostly dinosaurs
4.0,It's not that good. But it's cute though. I would like to have it if it has more shinning on it.
4.0,"Took this to go tubing-- like it a lot, but you may want to wash it prior to using it as it stained my white towels and cover up when it got wet."
4.0,Somewhat smaller than expected. Nice but very small.
4.0,Very nice looking chains for the money. A little skeptical if they are solid sterling silver or silver plated. No where on the chains is there a .925 marking. They also have made my neck itch and breaks me out.
4.0,This was for my  granddaughter who is 10 and I know she likes it a lot but that is all I know.
4.0,This might have been a nice skirt but it was WAY too large on me
4.0,A little too short for me but still cute.
4.0,I love the look of the shirt.  I also have it in gray and the same size.  The gray fits perfectly but the black seems to be a full size smaller.  So if you order a size up you should be good.
4.0,"The ring is beautiful but it was to big for my hand, I had to send it back."
4.0,"Fit is a little large , but comfortable."
4.0,"5‚Äô2 155, 38 dd and purchased medium. Fit perfect. Thick material and very great length around the mid section. The buttons are secure enough so everyone doesn‚Äôt see my boobs. Will definitely order more. Dropped a star to 4, only because with tax it comes to a little over $20 and I think the price point should be more around $13-$16 with tax."
4.0,The material is thin but not see through..It's nothing fancy but you have to know how to dress it up with right shoes/boots etc... It does and will show off all of your lumps and bumps if you have those.. but overall it's a really cute.
4.0,Wonderful customer service!  Adorable top!  Very fitted around the chest.
4.0,They are tights so how can you evaluate them precisely?  I'm satisfied but if I ordered again I would probably go up one size.
4.0,My husband likes the gray and black a lot. The silver is just too fake looking.
4.0,"I got this dress for our recent trip to Flordia and it was perfect.<br />It's a really cute dress and it fits great.<br />The material is comfortable to wear and ideal for our hot Louisiana summers<br />Excellent material; thin but not see-through.<br />It is opened in the front and ties closed; very cute design.<br /><br />I am in love with the pattern on this dress; it's super cute and different from the rest of the clothes in my closet.<br />It reminds me of the material on a bandana.<br />It's overall an excellent choice for a casual, summer dress."
4.0,"They were very flimsy. However, they did what I needed them to do and there was so many everyone at the party and then some got a hat."

4.0,"Takes practice to replace filters, but otherwise...no more inhaling co2."
4.0,"Color was, for lack of a better word &#34;Lovely&#34;.  The size was a little full, but after I cut my hair,<br />I intend to spray the band with water and stick in a heated oven to hopefully shrink the headband.<br />The &#34;Windy City&#34; will have you unexpectedly jogging chasing an loose fitting hat or cap of any kind."
4.0,"This replaced an Oligo.  This works great and is of good quality, but is soft sided.  I like it, but still miss the hard-sided Ogilo.  I hadn't planned on using this as a backpack, but it works great and leaves my hands free as I walk to the car so I can check my email and voice mails."
4.0,I bought these for post pregnancy boy was I still swollen however these did the job I loved them
4.0,"Slit in back was suuuuuuper high. I had to sew it to be lower. Other than that, the fit is great and comfortable."
4.0,"It looks like someone just chopped off the bottom of it, and it has some straggling threads. After trying it on a couple times, the bottom started to curl up (as stuff that isn‚Äôt hemmed does.) It‚Äôs a little thin too, but it‚Äôs still good. It fit me even though I‚Äôm larger, and it‚Äôs cute. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for the hemming thing, though."
4.0,Very cute and my daughter loved it
4.0,"Very pretty!  Wish I could have worn it.  It fit well on the top, but was a little tight in the hips."
4.0,Fits as expected. Good buy.
4.0,"Product was nice but the box it came in came all crushed, thankfully the product was okay."
4.0,"The XS fit my (very compressible) Northface Wasatch 40 sleeping bag and compressed to about half the size using the straps. The sack the sleeping bag came in was huge so i'm happy this compressed it so small. It will very easily fit in my 40L backpack now.  Material is light weight. But a bit thin, the straps aren't very wide either. So far it is holding up fine but the seams and pressure points don't seem very reinforced so I don't know how its going to hold up to real world use. The Alps Mountaineering stuff sacks which I also bought (for my clothes) are better quality than this but this but heavier. Overall I am happy with it, I just don't think I would trust it to compress something with a lot of resistance."
4.0,"This is a really cute, very lightweight, long sleeve shirt. Its thin, like t shirt material, but you cant see through it. The double hood is really cute and so is the button detail. Its very long so if you are looking for some bum coverage it should work well. It was looser than I expected and it flared at the waist more than I need, but I dont really have hips. It would work really well for someone with hips. It washes well, no pilling, and doesnt shrink in the wash."
4.0,Good quality but runs very small! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 126lbs average size and the medium was very tight. I should have ordered a large.
4.0,"Cute, but the crotch length was weird, like others have stated. I'm 5&#34;4&#34;, 108 lbs, and I ordered a small, and it fit overall, just wished the crotch length was different. It's hard to explain, just that the inseam is really short. It's cute, so maybe I'll try a medium, but I returned the small."
4.0,"It's winter. In Wisconsin. I need to keep my legs warm when wearing dresses! Works great with boots. The only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they are not 100% opaque. Not see through, but a bit light."
4.0,I bought this for Mother‚Äôs Day to give to my aunt and she loved it the chain on the side that says love actually said believe when it arrived but that didn‚Äôt really matter it‚Äôs built great and doesn‚Äôt scratch easily it is also easy to take off the little believe on the side as well as add something or put it on a bag or keychain
4.0,"This looks very pretty, but is VERY light weight - it is for a gift, so will see how he likes it and how well it wears."
4.0,"I liked the skirts, fit good and the colors were nice."
4.0,"This dress is beautifully made with soft fabric.  The fabric drapes well and is opaque.  If you're not sure about the size, go up. It is somewhat forgiving but it is easier to adjust a larger size than one where the waist is snug."
4.0,Pretty and comfortable like a lot
4.0,The watch looks great but the only issue really is that it doesn't come working with a battery.
4.0,"My glasses already have darkening when out in the sun but wanted extra darker color.  Good size, but be carefull w/ durty fingers, doesn't have a flap to assist you pull up clip.  Overall for the price are ok."
4.0,a little heavier than i expected. but warm.
4.0,I love the color and design of this earrings
4.0,I always get compliments when I wear these. Super cute.
4.0,"This dress is soooo cute on... the only thing is this dress is very thin . Super classy and chick , you won‚Äôt regret it !"
4.0,A little confusing to open. But super cute. Good quality too.
4.0,"The quality of the dress is decent. There were a few loose threads on the dress, but otherwise well made. The dress looks as pictured. This dress is a favorite of my daughter."
4.0,Nice look. Can be loose fitting
4.0,"The boots are the right size, comfy. They are absolutely cute and not too pricy. They look like good quality."
4.0,I found this as a replacement for existing jacket.It is very ccomfortable to wear as primary jacket or as a layer
4.0,"Loved how soft n warm the robe is.  Bit upset that it shows n also describes as &#34;long&#34;, but o my comes to mid to high calf. I would understand if I was tall, but I'm only 5' n just barely 100lbs. I even ordered medium to makes sure it could b long..."
4.0,"Great dress but it runs small. We bought it for my 13 year old daughter who is 5' 6"" and weighs around 120 and is a size 8. We ordered a large and it is tight. It will still be OK but if we had it to do over, I'd order an XL. Fabric seems durable and is stretchy and somewhat shiney, perfect or her christmas concerts at school."
4.0,I got a medium which is what I wear but it's more like an X-tra small so I gave them to my 11 year old grand daughter.
4.0,"It is a comfortable top and great cotton. It is pretty true to size, I am 32 A and I purchased XS. Beautiful combination of colors."
4.0,"I'm 5'9"", 160 lbs and normally I wear size 8-10 TALL in everything. I ordered both the black (S) and the yellow (XS) and I have been pleased with the fabric and fit. The (S) just hits the ground in bare feet, and the (XS) hits about an inch or two above the floor. Agreed that the pockets are only useful temporarily, and not for actual storage. The cut is quite attractive and the fabric is very soft."
4.0,"I bought both this EazyBelt and the slidebelt:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DR1EZ8M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 at the same time and have used them for about 6 months alternating between one and the other.<br /><br />Here are the major differences.<br />Eazybelt:<br /><br />Much cheaper, but you have to order a specific size.  I ordered my size and wound up a little snug.  Now they offer to fix that, I never really took them up on it, but it's the same offer Slidebelts makes.<br /><br />The ratcheting mechanism on the Eazybelt I prefer significantly.  It's MUCH quieter than the slidebelt.  Now to be fair, the slidebelt I got may not represent every type of buckle they offer, but when you cinch up the eazybelt, it's very quiet.  The slidebelt is very noisy in comparison.<br /><br />As for the belt itself, the leather is thick and looks like high quality.  The slidebelt leather doesn't &#34;look&#34; as nice but interestingly it SMELLS of leather.  My wife said this has more to do with how the leather is finished then necessarily the quality of the leather, so I don't know what to say there, but I do like the actual leather smell that the slidebelt has.<br /><br />My only flaw that I see on both belts is really it's Achilles heel.  The spot where the belt buckle attaches to the end of the belt (the non-ratcheting part) is small.  I don't know what the thinking was, but there are only 5-6 little pins in the middle on both belts that hold the buckle to the belt.  After some wear, I've found it to wear down, start twisting a bit and eventually even tear loose causing me to have to cut a 1/4 inch off to secure it again.  I've also had a few times where it will just pop loose if the belt gets pushed into the buckle by accident and suddenly the buckle is on the floor or hanging off the ratcheting mechanism.  Anyway, my main annoyance with it.  I was able to fix the issue by wedging a piece of cardboard into the end of the buckle mechanism to keep it from popping loose, but wish it did that better on it's own.  There is no torsion on that piece for some reason so it really can be problematic.<br /><br />Overall thought I still like both these belts.  This belt is thicker and I really prefer the ratcheting mechanism.  The Slidebelt comes in a much fancier case and seems to be a nicer leather, but the ratcheting mechanism is annoyingly loud."
4.0,Could have been a little bit larger
4.0,"The bracelet was really small, but the charms are perfect!"
4.0,"Sleeves are a little long, but this is my favorite jacket on my little man! Adorable and so soft! Also, the seem on the hood already has a hole, which sucks."
4.0,"Color matched exactly, it does cause some irritation with my skin, nothing dramatic though"
4.0,Chose the large based on the measurements even though I am normally a medium and it's still tight. Pretty dress.
4.0,"My only gripe bout this is the color is more of a latte (tan) rather than coffee (brown). Otherwise its soft, comfortable and fits like the picture."
4.0,"Very comfortable, great deep V neck, fit true to size. However, made in China - probably should have figured from the low price, but the description says made in the USA."
4.0,I was looking for a baggy t-shirt and came across this one. Love the color and the way it fits. I typically wear a size M to L but order an XL to get the baggy look I wanted.
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my sister for Christmas. When she opened them and took them out of the padded box that I wrapped them in the one earring had come apart. Easy enough to fix, a loop had just separated, but frustrating when you give someone something and that happens. She likes the earrings and I hope she doesn't have any issues with them in the future."
4.0,Bought two for two little girls for Christmas and they loved it.  They were inferior quality.
4.0,Was a nice watch for price only thing I would change and did change was watch band was very flimsy
4.0,"Picture somewhat misleading, fit my gf more like a blouse, very very short"
4.0,Great helmet. Runs a bit smaller than the advertised size. I gave it to my wife and she loves it. Other than the sizing I have no complaints
4.0,Overall they were pretty good face masks but the inseam is pretty itchy with the way it lays.
4.0,Pretty necklace and quite a statement when worn with a black dress.  I would love to find matching earrings.
4.0,"Love the neckline and they way it hangs, could be  a tad longer.  I like the material, too.  Wish it came in more colors."
4.0,They are very soft comfortable and easy to slide foot into. They sometimes slide off foot when walking.
4.0,Nice! Wife likes em. That really all that matters. Little snug around the thighs.
4.0,"Nice t-shirt, not too thin or transparent, and exactly as pictured. I am generally between a M and a L, and the M fit perfectly. I wish the sleeves were just an inch or two longer, but overall, I find this better quality and truer to description than most shirts sold on Amazon these days."
4.0,"Great shirt overall.  I mentioned it to be somewhat small because of the chest dimensions.  It seems a bit small in the chest.  As a reference though, I am 6'3&#34;, 265 lbs. with a 50 inch chest.  Fabric feels smooth and is a nice fit less the chest."
4.0,Smaller than how a large normally fits. Otherwise it's a great sweatshirt.
4.0,I bought this to wear while hunting. Have only tested it a few times but so far it works very well. I get cold very easily and shivering is hard on my joints and muscles. I've kept this on B setting between 50 & 55 and I've been comfortable. I do kind of wish it had sleeves as now I realize how cold the arms can get. The only trouble I've had so far is that it is too long at the top even when the snaps were set to smallest position. It's a minor inconvenience and doesn't affect the performance. Try to find a slim battery pack that fits into the pocket.
4.0,"The neck is a little too tight, which nakes it a little difficult while wearing but after that it's ok. The length of the tights is too short( I am 5,11) hence  the 4star. The picture shows it long, but it barely covers my knee."
4.0,On the big side for me. Great for snowy weather. Warm and dry.
4.0,"I purchased 3 of these pj‚Äôs.  18 month, 3 yr old and 7yr old granddaughter‚Äôs love these pj‚Äôs.  They are very warm.  They never wanted to take them off."
4.0,"I bought this for the alarm, shock clock 2, zapping - electrocution feature, and i love it.  I have dysania and am always late for work since high school.  This zap puts adrenaline, dread, and fear that wakes me up!  Yet to me it's so less #@$& annoying than going from totally asleep to being abruptly and rudely awakened by an annoying loud alarm clock located across the room that makes me dizzy when I have to stand up too fast to turn it off, making me want to punch the clock, and putting me in a pissy morning mood where I hate the world.  This watch gives you a moment to adjust to reality, so i am not grumpy in morning.  I've been using it for about 3 months.  The zap strength and interval are customizable.  I'm currently using 70% stenghth, 3 zaps, alternates with 5 buzzing vibrations, with 45 sec rest interval - - again all customizable.  I put the QRS bar code in bathroom, so i have to get up to turn it off, but i have peaceful 45 seconds (or longer) to adjust my mindset. The jumping jax alternative is also cool, but i prefer bar code, which I printed off their web site.  The sleep tracker feature is ok, kind of cool, not really necessary.  I do not wear it during the day for any other habits.  I ""re-pair"" the device with my smartphone every night, although not necessary, but just to be sure.  My only complaints are:  the watch band is slightly uncomfortable; and i wish the alarm wouldn't auto shut off after 15-20 mins  (but perhaps that just means i need to turn up my zapper strength so it's too painful and shocking to ride out the alarm) .  If you go to their web site, i think you can rent the thing by the month instead of upfront purchase."
4.0,"5 cards, 5 bills and still looks as if there is nothing in it<br />Will never buy a regular wallet again. This thing fits everywhere confortably"
4.0,"Good size, very masculine feel to it."
4.0,"Color is a little more Orange than pictured, but still very cute"
4.0,"The dress is OK. Pretty good quality but.. not a very good design on a plus size, which is what I ordered. It looked like a costume on me. Like Renaissance or something. I returned it with no issues."
4.0,"Not flawless high quality, but great for the price and a very kind gift üíô"
4.0,Beautiful Sterling Silver Amethyst Earrings!
4.0,"I bought this dress in an XL and it actually fit quite nicely except for the chest area, which was too big for my modest bosom. For reference, I am 5'7, 205 lbs, 36B. I considered making alterations to the dress so it would fit more snugly in the upper area but I don't think I can do that without another piece of fabric flapping out. I suspect if I buy a smaller size, it will fit my boobs better but the rest would be too small.  I will be returning but wish I didn't have to :/"
4.0,"well made, good heavy material, did not shrink in laundry.  Properly sized, too."
4.0,Beautiful present for my daughter
4.0,"Lovely jewelry set. Not made for an active gal like myself. The bracelets have both broken . . . I have worn them both to yoga, while jogging, to work, weekend activities, etc. Will order another set and keep in jewelry box for special occasions only. Great price!!"
4.0,"a little larger than expected, but the overall design/distressing is great!"
4.0,"I love it. The material is nice and stretchy. I thought it would be kind of stiff with no stretch, but that's not the case at all. I'm 5'1 and 115 lbs and ordered the small. It was was too long so I will get it hemmed, and a bit too big, but not too big where I can't wear it. Wished they had an extra small and I would exchange for that. I'm small on the bottom half but larger on top so the top fit much better than the bottom. Just kind of hangs on my bottom half instead of hugging it. I got the black and white one and it's not see through. The brown belt it came with was extremely large. Could almost wrapped around twice so I will use a different belt (I hadn't my own belt on in pics). I took a star off because the belt should have been proportional to the size I ordered, but I feel like they sent me a large belt with a size small jumpsuit."
4.0,"The material seems to be very good quality, the hood kinda oversize unless you wearing a baseball cap. the sleeves probably little short for some. the front pouch pocket kinda weird, zippers there, but no zipper puller. have not been out in the rain yet, can't say the jacket is waterproof, but seems like it should be. I'm wearing US size large, I ordered size XL and it fit just right if you want xtra room you might have to order 2 size up. other than that I'm happy with it."
4.0,"I order for Asian Inspired shops all the time and usually the material is lower end and cheap. This one is a thicker and heavier poly-blend that is not good for summer, but great for fall, winter, spring. Very tasteful with good graphics. The back zippers are nice. One zipper is a bit tough than the other, but it is ok. I put 4 stars because it is ot good for summer and zipper issue, but I would order more from this shop."
4.0,"Dress is so cute, I am 5'6 and found this dress to be a perfect length. My only real issue is that in areas where it stretches. (For me In the chest area) it does become a bit see through. Not a huge issue though. Perfect dress to be able to dress down to go to the store, or dress up for a night out."
4.0,"Earings are cute, they are bigger than I expected, and the backs of the earrings are flimpsy"
4.0,"As others have stated, the drawstrings don't work. But as long as it keeps the wind and rain out, I'm good."
4.0,Fits well. True to size. Material is a little stiff feeling but not bad for the price
4.0,A bit stiff on bracelet but can work
4.0,"Fits nicely to camouflage my post baby belly. I love the longer torso length so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll expose my belly if I reach up or move wrong. Wish the bra area was a little more supportive and the padding was a little thicker and sewn in, but it‚Äôs not terrible."
4.0,"I got these for my girlfriend and myself. Mine is doing great but my girlfriend's broke so she had to pick up the beads, get a new string, and remake it."
4.0,"I am 33-25-34 5'8'' and got a medium, which fit the way I wanted it too (I wanted it to be bigger so I looked smaller). However, the product photo, the other review photos, and what I received are all very different. Quality was cheap in some aspects but passable overall! Especially as a budget costume, not bad at all!<br />The cap feather is very tiny and super bent. The bloomers / skirt are built into one, not like the product photo where they are separate. The socks will always fall down. The hat comes with no way to keep it on your head, so use pins.<br />OH THE GLOVES were horrid. Thumb and pinkies on both gloves were twice the length they needed to be and looked like crazy alien fingers! What were they thinking lol.<br />Some details seem to be off from other people's pics / product photos. But I stand by that this is a great budget Klee!"
4.0,So i got this for my daughters birthday and was happy with it but thought there would be a little bit more sense we spent 8$ dollars on it
4.0,A little small to me
4.0,Only 4 stars as it came without the buttons.
4.0,"It's true. They're easier to get on without wrestling, and support sufficiently without being uncomfortable, especially after a long day or long plane trip. I will buy some more."
4.0,"So far they are great! I love the padded, larger shoulder strap. It hooks and u hooks easily. And the material is so soft."
4.0,Like will purchase again. I will go up size for thick stocks.
4.0,Really fun earrings
4.0,"I was looking for a compression shirt and I ordered based of my normal size. I like these but there isn't as much compression as I expected  in the stomach/waist. I should have sized down (I usually wear small in tops). Overall a nice top, I would just suggest sizing down if you're looking for more support."
4.0,Very beautiful but to large!
4.0,I bought this as a gift. It is nice quality and seems to the job done. I sort of wish it had a clasp but it's alright.
4.0,"Really like the quality.  Was surprised that it was lined and that the embroidery was so well done.  The apron tie is long enough to wrap around and tie in the front (on either side) per traditional dirndls.  The blouse fit just fine, but I don't have &#34;enough&#34; to fill it out, so I just tuck the bit of extra material down into the front of the bodice.  I went up in size after reading other reviews.  I have broad shoulders, so after sizing up it fits as I need it to across my back and I have a little extra room in the waist.  I took off one star because when my package arrived, I opened the box and the plastic packaging bag to find that the zipper was broken (The Edelweiss charm popped right off because the zipper cover broke, and the actual zipper would not zip up because the slider was faulty).  Luckily, I had a friend who replaced the zipper and reatached the charm.  Overall, I love it!"
4.0,A bit tight around the knees. I'll just have to lose weight. Other than that they are ok.
4.0,"Great styling, drapes beautifully, very flattering. Dress it up with a scarf or big statement necklace. Color is exactly as in the picture.  Fabric is on the cheesy side though. Would happily pay more for better quality material."
4.0,"I ordered this March 14th and received it by March 18th. It‚Äôs a little weird to get the ring in. I wish it was a charm on a single bar. The bar is two pieces that screw into the charm. But other than the odd way it‚Äôs created, it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs cute. It fits well. It‚Äôs exactly as pictured."
4.0,It seems smaller than pictured. Wish I could find it in medium because it's well made and attractive.
4.0,"I'm a 36C and I ordered up because almost everyone suggested it and the band was too loose. The cup size seems to be closer to a normal 36C. There is just a little padding inside. It was l too big to give me any cleavage that would show in a shirt. Once I tightened the laces it just squeezed my boobs together more on the bottom, but that's probably because of my own anatomy.<br /><br /> I don't know if I would order it again in my own size. I'm worried the cups will be too tight. The quality seems just fine for the price. Nothing rough or scratchy. I'll be returning it because the band is loose."
4.0,Love this wallet! I was looking for something versitile and sophisticated but mainly something to protect. And this is it! It's big enough to hold what you need but not too big to look ridiculous. The wristlet is detachable. You can even fit your phone and probably a small lip gloss. I use it everyday but it's definitely nice enough for a night out. It's very sturdy and well made. I cannot rave enough about this wallet. And it protects your cards! Most important feature.<br /><br />**Update** I still really like this wallet but just wanted to say that I've had it since May (less then 5 months) and it's already strarting to fall apart which makes me sad...
4.0,Have not worn yet to review.  However skimpy in size.  Love the look.<br />Great coverage for rain or wind if it works.
4.0,"the shorts are a little big, but other then that, its very nice."
4.0,Very nice shoes little hard to get on sometimes but I do recommend them.  Have received lots of compliments!
4.0,Not a true bikini for if you are small waisted.
4.0,My 10 year old plays soccer and getting new cleats each season is her favorite thing! These re super cute and very vibrant! My only complain is that the laces are VERY short and come untied very easily. I cannot double knot them because they are so short! She spends a little extra time tying her shoes over the course of her games and practices but all in all they are nice little cleats.
4.0,"Neat little watch. It tells time well, but it doesn't have a running display. So you have to press the button to see the time. After you press the button the lights will light up, and you have to count the number of lights to get the time. It's fairly simple enough, left side shows hours and the middle/right shows the minutes. It's not the most convenient watch to use, but it's cool and is a fun gift for tech enthusiasts and people who want something &#34;modern&#34; or unique looking."
4.0,"I really love this necklace so far! I just received it today and is really cute! The clasp is easy to use which is a plus. The cat and fish are pretty small, smaller than a quarter as seen in the picture I include. However, for $10 I am super happy with my purchase."
4.0,It's a great band! It is a little large/small for me depending on the hole. I could use one in the middle which they informed me they are coming out with which I will be purchasing because it really is a great band for smart watches! I have the larger Zenwatch 2.
4.0,Easy and cool to use.
4.0,We got this for my daughter to wear for school and we loved it. She had so much fun wearing it.
4.0,"It fit great - flowy and summery as desired. I bought the pale pink and the lavender - and they are VERY sheer and see through. Both layers are thin. I have ordered a white slip to try underneath and I am hoping that will do the trick and shut down the peep show! It's a cute dress and the Large fits my usual size 10-12. EDIT: With a separately purchased nude spandex slip underneath, it's great."
4.0,"Can‚Äôt find anything wrong with it...true to size, fits under regular shorts and extends my biking wardrobe."
4.0,Awesome dress! I look forward to purchasing more in different colors.
4.0,I love the look of these. They will look good with dresses or pants. I did find them to be quite stiff and tight around the toe area. The stiffness I think will work itself out over time but the tightness in the toe area may be a problem if worn for long periods of time. I would still recommend for the cost and looks.
4.0,"Definitely size up! I got a small for me, 5ft and weight about 145 lbs. I am a little bigger from my bottom half, so my thighs did not fit. Fortunately I got a medium for my husband and wore that one, but my husband was not able to dress up with me for an early Halloween party we had. The medium still fit snug on my bottom but did it‚Äôs purpose. Also, the mask smells super rubbery."
4.0,Cute and light weight dress
4.0,"I purchased this in wine red hoping it would match a David's Bridal dress in wine. I'm leaving a review in case someone is looking for something similar. While this seems well made and is a pretty scarf, it does NOT match the color I needed. It is more red than it looked in the listing. I have attached an image to show the color difference.<br /><br />I'm still giving the scarf 4 stars because it seems to be a nice scarf. The color was the only real issue I had."
4.0,The quality was so good! The only problem was that I got a size one larger. My fault!
4.0,"The slip is great, good length but I really don't like the material."
4.0,Love it but it‚Äôs missing a button on the inside but since you can‚Äôt see it I kept it.
4.0,"Dress is a little large in the waist, but otherwise fits nicely. The pattern is vibrant and clear. Material is cheap but so is the dress, so it's to be expected. A really cute piece."
4.0,"I normally wear size 4 US small , for reference I am 130 lb , 34 D , neck line is pretty low and the sleeves is pretty short eventhough it's not a midi sleeves! Totally looks ok but not pefect!"
4.0,"The Keepons delivered were excellent and what I wanted.  I did try to order a variety pack on the Keepon web site but, as I recall, was not able to make my way to checkout."
4.0,I ordered 2 pair of these joggers; a teal(blue) pair and a Drawstring Cassis.  The blue pair with the flat wide waist was tighter in the waist and butt than the Drawstring pair.  It also seemed like the blue pair was made of a thinner material; you could see my underwear line.  The waist is also much higher.  The Drawstring pair fit more true to size and was more comfortable and because it's slightly thicker my panty line is less noticeable.  I'll most likely purchase other colors but only the Drawstring style.
4.0,"Very hot shirt! Runs small, order a size up!"
4.0,Fast delivered. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work for me. Too thin. It is more for younger people. Good customer service and wonderful return method.
4.0,Seem to be made with quality materials bit design of filter pocket causes filters tocompress and deform.
4.0,"These are adorable on, and you cannot beat the cute squeaking! We got so many compliments!"
4.0,"Cute little dress, price point good. Fabric on the upper is soft."
4.0,After reading the reviews most people thought that the dress was running to a smaller size so I ordered the extra large and now I need to find a belt to go with this dress because it's too big I don't want to return it because I like the dress it's pretty on it's just straight and you show no shaping at but with a belt it would be perfect I would buy this dress again and a different color but in a smaller size
4.0,"i bought this to replace another casio,as  at night the other casio was  hard to read the time,this on will work well"
4.0,These are very nice glasses but did not come with nose piece!! I dont know if possible to have that part sent or to return the glasses.
4.0,"I love this sweater! I get comments on it everywhere I go! I‚Äôm a preschool teacher and the kids love it! The only pitfall about it is the sleeves at the shoulder and the pockets are becoming a bit unraveled / detached... I‚Äôm not a knitter so I have sat down and sewn it back together. I adore it, I wish the version which is pastel rainbow had the same balloon sleeves."
4.0,I got these for my little girl to wear to gymnastics in the winter time. She is a very tall 4 year old and these were really long even on her. The waist fit her great and the material is nice and stretchy...but they were really long...that's my only complaint. We just hemmed them though and that worked for now.
4.0,Purchased as a gift and they like it.
4.0,"the design is nice and is quite small and compact. The quality seems great and i can see it lasting a long while. My big question upon order was whether or not i could put my metro card in the plastic sectional case outside of the card ejector. The answer is yes, it works and scans well which is awesome. My only complaint is that i wish it could somehow carry more cash, but it stores 5 bills folded nicely. Loose change seems to have no solution out of any slim wallet I've been looking for including this one. Overall I'm pretty stoked to upgrade to the secrid and get rid of my old bill fold."
4.0,Great quality nice snow suit
4.0,"My niece Loves her shark pants! They've help up well considering they get worn and washed about once a week. The fabric has not pilled, stretched or faded much."
4.0,"We received this shoe and although we went according to the size chart (measured with their ruler on my daughter's foot) it was not accurate. The shoes is absolutely enormous, too big by an entire size. My daughter wears a size 1 in any shoe and we will be sending these back for a size 13.5. I can't comment on anything else since she is not able to wear them."
4.0,"I've been going back and forth on if I want to just get my septum pierced or not, and haven't been able to make a decision. These are the perfect solution to my problem.<br />I do have to say, the ones with the little balls and hoops at the end don't stay on very well, and I kinda feel like a bull with those. But the normal ones and the diamond one are beautiful! You have to find the perfect spot to put them and they stay in place for the most part.<br />I think the only downfall is the diamond hoops are ""too solid"" so you can't tighten them at all to make them a little more snug on your nose.<br />All in all, for the price point, it's worth it. With how many different styles and colors, even though I don't like a portion of them, you can't beat the price. The diamond ones alone are worth it!<br />I think this has finally made my decision that I want a septum piercing for real, and can't wait to have a reason to buy some real jewelry from them."
4.0,"I really like this bag. I want to start positively by saying I was completely impressed by the quality of this bag! The leather, canvas and hardware are all quality material. I hate to use &#34;for the price..&#34; because I didn't expect a whole lot. BUT, for the price, I expected a whole lot less. It's always good to open the box and be gleeful! Anyway, great material, great look. Oh, there's a zipper that expands the bottom making it easier to shove in a pair of sunglasses. I thought I should add that before I got to what I don't like.<br />I did not like VERY few things that I think are exclusive to me. The outside pouch doesn't accommodate my gigantic iphone 6 +. I shouldn't have had the expectation that it would. However, the pocket inside does. I wish when these bags were made, someone would consider making the inside a lighter color. Finding things in a black hole (or brown in this case) is difficult. The zipper on the outside pouch is a bit awkward but the back pocket zipper is not and I found it to be perfect for my car key. I would have given 5 starts if the liner was a lighter color. I will be looking at other products made by this company!"
4.0,I liked this so much I'm looking for more colors. Adds such a great touch to any suit.
4.0,Needed a slip since it's a thinner fabric but the color and print are great! I would recommend getting a size larger because of it.
4.0,"Runs a slightly on the small side. Feels great, really soft."
4.0,"Quality is great. Feels a bit thin but that's the point. I am partial to a thicker shirt just because that makes me feel it is more quality but not always true. These shirts are great. I'm 6'4"" 260 athletic build dad bod and they fit great."
4.0,I got this as a pool coverup.  It is adorable for casual events as I bought it for a larger fit.
4.0,"Great durable materials,<br />Stack up well when full<br />Strong and easy to handle<br />Easy to carry in variety of ways<br />Great for laundry<br />Great clothes moth and/or carpet beetle or other pest protection (bedbugs etc)<br /><br />**Large spacious size** for many storage options, yet not so big as to be unwieldy<br /><br />Downsides:<br />I did have a seam open next to the zipper on top of the bags on two- one split open completely and the other is threatening to. To be fair, I believe I got a few duds and the other bags are tip top and I was quite pleased. The zippers are sturdy and work well. The bag is thick and durable, like similar IKEA bags if not a little bit better."
4.0,"Nice necklace, great colors.  Have not had it long enough to know if it will tarnish.  Will come back after a few months to update."
4.0,"Really a great suit, but I'm a D cup and I was kind of falling out of it. I actually replaced to foam cups with larger ones, then with a few other small modifications it worked fine. Otherwise it's very flattering."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e1026db3c3c0085344df2f4c2bada326]] It put smile on hubbys face
4.0,"Good price fast free shipping, they are very easy to breath in and washable too I purchased these twice"
4.0,"I ordered a pair of the SecureSleeves to help me heal my eczema-caused wounds in my arms, wrists and hands. They have been really useful to use under my winter clothes to help stop the itch. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and ordered size medium, they fit really well. My only complain would be that the hole for the thumb is quite big, leaving a big part of the wrist uncovered. I‚Äôm ordering more pairs, so I can have enough for the whole week."
4.0,Is cute but is definitely small.  Better fit for a child.  The metal is strong and has no give so even if you are an adult with a small wrist it is difficult to slide the bracelet on.
4.0,Headed to beach vacation & husband wanted another hat.
4.0,"I like the design on them and the color was beautiful but sadly, they‚Äôre extremely sheer so I have to where leggings under them. They‚Äôre very tight around the butt which I‚Äôm not a huge fan of. They‚Äôre also extremely tight in the waist area. I get size small-medium in everything and they fit really well except these."
4.0,Handles were turned over when arrived and was hoping they would reshape but haven't. Really like this style and the feel of the leather is great
4.0,"Got it for my keychain.  Rash of thefts lately from kids asking for time then stealing cell phone.  Easy fix--get a watch.<br />This one is kind of cute.  The face is plastic and the watch case is such a thin metal that it flexes.  The clip is quite sturdy.  Don't think it will last on my carabiner of keys--might move it to my purse.<br />Pros: functional, basic watch. Inexpensive.  Kind of has a steam punk feel. Smooth.<br />Cons: cheaply made.  more fragile than I expected.<br />Update: I left it on my keychain and the glass face broke after 3 months.  Hands came off shortly after that."
4.0,"Initial response is that it is fine. How it will hold up over time, I can't tell right now because I haven't had it long enough to make that evaluation.I will say that it is not for the modest because it does have a pronounced sight line of a guy's nipples. But, if you just want something to help keep the sun off of you for a while at the beach when it's too bright or warm, it works for me. I like the pocket very much. Very handy."
4.0,Are super lightweight and so comfortable. Wish the design was on both sides
4.0,"Super soft, comfortable shirt!  I'm in the auto parts business so it's perfect!<br /><br />Update:  After wearing this shirt several times, the fabric is starting to pill/snag and seems to be too thin.  Collar area is getting really fuzzy too.  Screen print is still holding up nicely."
4.0,Loved the pillow. Very comfy and you can bend it several ways. I took it to Singapore with me. Used it allot instead of a pillow. Was also good behind my neck. Very versatile
4.0,"I really liked it! The shoes are really comfortable and look nice, I like also that is handmade, it gives it a different look."
4.0,Love the top. Bottoms I feel like they were to small.
4.0,"I really liked this product.  I initially purchased it to wear to a dinner in Dubai, but bought something else more colorful.  However, it is my go to lounging dress.  It is sooooo comfortable.  I would definitely buy another."
4.0,I got it as a gift for my dad.  He likes it and it fits well.  Now all we need is for England to play better during world cups!
4.0,"This swimsuit is very cute and very flattering. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lot of support in the breast area. The back is really cute, as it is crisscrossed. The length is just enough to feel modest. The pattern is super cute, and looks exactly the same as the picture."
4.0,Bought them for Rayban classic sunglasses and they didn't fit. Disappointed to send this item back. Great quality though.
4.0,Beautiful but should have gotten a size bigger than I normally wear!
4.0,"It seems like a well built jacket, Biggest cons, I wish it had at least 1 pocket inside and a net loop in the back.  It is 4 inches too long."
4.0,"This was a great item, in general, and matched the description. Everybody loved this costume when my daughter tried it on and paraded around, jumping and dancing. The problem that we did not anticipate is that she has no use of her arms and could not wear it trick-or-treating or really anywhere."
4.0,Slightly smaller than anticipated
4.0,"The product has some flaws. It feels cheap and doesn‚Äôt fit a large wrist like mine. The product is priced right however. I just wish it was bigger or that they offered a larger size. But like I said, not bad for $10"
4.0,This was a nice dress that fit well and was comfortable on.  I'm 5'4 and ordered a large. After reading the reviews I thought it would be way too long and I would need to have it hemmed but when I put it on I noticed that while it was still long and would need hemming it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The only drawback for me was how far up it came on the neck.  I don't want things to be low cut in any form but this was really high up and I have somewhat of a short neck I guess you could say.  Unfortunately I ended up having to send it back and am now on the search for another black maxi dress.
4.0,This wallet is good to have for travelling
4.0,"The fabric feels great and I feel it fits true to size, though it does look a bit matronly. I also didn't receive the color I ordered which was disappointing. (I ordered cream and the tag says cream, but based on the photos I clearly got brown) I will probably wear it regardless of these issues but I don't know that I'll be buying another in the future. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Shirt is not tight which is nice, size chart is accurate"
4.0,Comfortable & has some support. The quilted look is unique & sassy
4.0,Good deal. Worry free pieces.
4.0,"There were many bad Reviews. I am a Plus Size & come up to the Elbow, there is not any Issues with the Size. They are fine. I Hope this Helps other People ."
4.0,"Nice classy watch, will wear to certain events but sometimes the time stops, I think from bumping it or something. Otherwise it is a very good classy watch. Hard to put on at first, but you just need to break it in."
4.0,"I looked at the reviews  first. Normally I wear a medium,  so I  ordered a large, glad I did. Sleeves come past my wrists, I'm 5 1/2.  Wore a heavy sweater under it. Sleeves are not lined like the rest of the coat"
4.0,Very beautiful design
4.0,Good light zip up jacket to just ‚Äúthrow in the car‚Äù when you‚Äôre running around.
4.0,"I followed the sizing chart and found myself right on the border of two sizes (isn‚Äôt that always what happens?).  I vote for comfort first, so I went with the larger of the two sizes.  It‚Äôs supportive, non restrictive, and totally COMFORTABLE.  Easy to slip on. No trying to tug the back band down because it‚Äôs twisted up.  Wearable all day without wanting to maniacally rip it off and slingshot it out of a window.  It‚Äôs made well.  It‚Äôs a thicker double layer of fabric, so doesn‚Äôt look/feel like a flimsy sleep bra. Color was spot on true to what I saw in the listing (a peacock teal).  Overall I‚Äôd purchase another."
4.0,"Nice print, but too small.  I wear a US size 6 and their size large barely wrapped across my chest."
4.0,"I wear a Med but these ride down a bit when doing HIIT workouts on the thighs and crotch- yet I have thick thighs! Super comfy to wear any wrest even to bed! Regardless, I love them!!!"
4.0,"The only problem I had with these boots is that while they have a zipper on the side, I was always having to retie them at the front because they would untie as I was putting them on while using the zipper.  With as tall as the boots were, it got a little tiring after awhile... I was using these for daily use though so it wouldn't be a big issue for less frequent uses."
4.0,Nice quality for the price...
4.0,When first purchasing this product I was a little bit skeptical due to the reviews. After getting it in the mail two days prior from ordering it I was not upset. in the picture above they look big but in reality they‚Äôre actually the perfect size. although you can still see the cardboard through the feathers that is an easy fix with gluing more feathers onto it but for the price this isn‚Äôt at all bad.
4.0,The light is nothing like indiglo its a tiny light at the left edge useless.  The size very very small barely bigger then a quater. Not worth sending back i have no kids to give it to so i cut the band off and stuck it on my tool box.  Live and learn.
4.0,fit so neatly
4.0,"Great quality fabric, but the small is too tight in the waist, and the medium is baggy at the knee. I am 5'9&#34; 130lbs. I am sad that these don't work for me because the feel of the fabric and quality of the construction is great."
4.0,"The one size fits all I'm not going to lie freaked me out, but when I received it I was pleasantly surprised. I figured I might have to return it when it got here but it's one of my new faves. I'm 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs and it fits perfectly on me and my friend who tried it one that is 5'1&#34; so really one size fits all and it looks great!"
4.0,Product is what I expected.
4.0,I ordered royal blue and got navy so I returned it and reordered another one<br />Liked the dress but it was very snug
4.0,"I love soft-soled shoes for my sons when they were first learning to walk. The Robeez are durable, but the elastic closure seemed to pinch my kids ankles a little too much"
4.0,They do the job and dry quickly.  Works for what I need at the gym.
4.0,Nice fit.  But wasn't expecting vest to have red buttons.  In the picture they Appeared  black
4.0,The quality of this suit was great and fit was very flattering. Unfortunately I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and it was not long enough in the torso. If you are tall or just have a long torso this may not work for you.
4.0,Super cute top and love the color! This fits me fine in a medium. For reference I am a 36DD. The material is thin so you definitely need a bra underneath. This top can easily be dressed up or down. Not my favorite item from Patty Boutik but it is high up on the list.
4.0,"I really like these pattern of these pants however somewhere in the description it says there‚Äôs an elastic waistband, which there isn‚Äôt. I did order a size up from normal and sewed in my own elastic and they fit better now, it‚Äôs just a mild inconvenience. Otherwise they look like the photos!"
4.0,I love the glittery earrings!  The reason that I didn‚Äôt give them 5 stars is because they came in a tiny plastic box and I have to take them all out of the tiny box to find the matching earrings.  This was inconvenient and I will have to find an earring holder to put them in.
4.0,They're very nice
4.0,A little chintzy. I didn't realize at the time that the letters were not stitched.
4.0,"This scarf is awesome, I'm not gonna lie. I wear it nonstop now. HOWEVERRR it is much shorter than how it appears on the models. It's still an appropriate scarf length. The hemming stays put. It took forever to come, about a month, but I expected such because of the price. All in all, totally worth getting. If the hemming you get is defective, you can always just re-hem it. not a big deal."
4.0,Love the tank but runs very small.  I am usually a small in most brands but I think I can actually fit a large or XL for this one.  Make sure you buy at least two sizes up unless you want it to be extremely snug.
4.0,Product looking good .Its fits for my waist perfectly ..need to use and check ...design is not tat great but quality is good
4.0,"Love the pants, and usually a 36 fits a bit tight, but on this pant a 35 waist would fit me better and I could get into a 34 waist with a bit of stretch."
4.0,I love the color and clarity of these gauges. My only issue as always with pieces like this is the durability. Both gauges chipped pretty quickly. One of which I didn‚Äôt notice at first and cut me pretty badly.
4.0,"Are very good, but the delivery was about 25 days."
4.0,I like the fit and feel of this cardigan and it's great for dressing up or dressing down an outfit. Good purchase.
4.0,"It has most everything you need, I bought an extra tunic for effect and it fit okay however the pants are very baggy and it didn‚Äôt stay tight so I used sticky Velcro to fix it to a position. Overall it‚Äôs a good foundation to build a great costume on."
4.0,"This is an wonderful sized id/coin/card case that fits great in a pocket.  I wish it had a key ring as I had one before that did.  However, the keys can get too bulky so this may be better for me.  I highly recommend this product and gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the key ring issue."
4.0,Very beautiful dress nice material with the exception of the straps they are just long elastic cord. Could be sturdier and not so stretchy. Also a little longer than I expected even with heals
4.0,My wife lovet
4.0,I like that is good
4.0,"Cute. Such a good idea. I got the large, and wished I had gotten the extra large. It's a little close. My hips are 40/41 for reference."
4.0,"First of all, there are a lot fewer options for straps in odd lug width measurements (17, 19, 21 mm) so it's nice that iStrap provides a decent quality option. The calfskin leather has broken in nicely. The butterfly clasp works well and doesn't feel cheap. One complaint is that the holes stretch a little too easily when resting on my winder cassette...but if you're not using a watch winder then that's an irrelevant point."
4.0,Very cute and easy to slip on. My only objection was that it did not take well to my washing machine. The color faded out and the texture had pulls. Be sure to read the washing direction and err on the side of caution.
4.0,"The monkey dress was super cute and comfy. I'm curvy and about 5""5 150lbs the Medium fit perfect.<br />I wish it didn't have pockets, because that adds bulk where most women don't need it. Otherwise adorable and so comfy. I got the cute purse on Amazon too..adorbs!"
4.0,"This is a nicely made, lighter weight, sweatshirt hoodie. It fits perfectly on the average weight, taller person. Thought I try a different look with the big Velcro pocket on the front. I like it okay and it‚Äôs been really fun to carry our puppy around in because it‚Äôs open only on top. It has two Velcro pieces that hold it down but it sometimes lifts on the corners and looks goofy. The color has stayed well through washing and drying."
4.0,Esta  bonita  la tela es  delgada  el√°stica
4.0,"I like the bracelet, but the ringlet that attaches the clasp is not strong and will allow the bracelet to come apart very easily."
4.0,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. They are very super cute and seem like they will hold up well.
4.0,"The glasses is good, but it‚Äôs too big for my face. I prefer a smaller round glasses."
4.0,"Snags easy, but comfy fits as expected could be thicker"
4.0,The idea of this sounds great but you must use it before your legs are swollen or you cannot zip it up so far I have not been able to use it because of this problem
4.0,"Love the classic message in the black to-shirt. Although the shirt is a tighter fit & the headband keeps slipping off my head, I love my Friday shirt! Beautiful message ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4.0,I would give it 5 stars but I didn‚Äôt like that the crotch area wasn‚Äôt a button closure. It‚Äôs difficult to put on and take off with the clamps that you have to slide on & off.
4.0,"I love the length! Tall ladies won‚Äôt be disappointed. I am 5‚Äô11‚Äù, 188lbs, 36DDD. I ordered size L, Red color.  The red is a good light-burgundy color.  This dress came down to my ankles and that‚Äôs more than I expected!  The pocket placements were a little weird as they were high and stuck out, didn‚Äôt drape; maybe ordering up a size would‚Äôve helped, but the dress would‚Äôve looked like a sack of potatoes; as there are no side slits and smaller at the ankles.  I will likely remove the pockets."
4.0,"I love this and already bought more than 10 pairs. thick, soft and very very comfortable. I will probably get more....."
4.0,"This is is a nice fleece/cardigan, but I just wish the cuffs weren‚Äôt so long.  They add a balloon effect to the arms.  Otherwise a cute cardigan that fits and feels as expected."
4.0,"These pants in Army green fit great. I wear size 36 X 32 inseam and they are perfect in the length and waist. I had ordered these in the Khaki, but they fit a bit tight. The fleece lining is nice. My only complaint is that there were a lot of strings to cut off. But it only took me 10 mins with a nail clipper. I am very happy with these and will be ordering a pair in Black too."
4.0,"Runs a little big, but a nice cotton dress."
4.0,"My daughter is 9 and we ordered a size 3. Fit as expected. Love the support and durability of the soles as she is extremely rough on her shoes. With that said, the color is beautiful for spring but by the first day on the playground at school (rubber tire base) they were visibly dirty. I'm battling keeping the peach color clean daily but they are worth it. Great shoe so far!"
4.0,"I've owned similar shoes in the past so I didn't expect too much from these shoes quality-wise. However, when I received my order, I have to say I was impressed. Granted, the the overall quality isn't spectacular but with reasonable care, I think they will last more more than just one season of wear. The shoes have no real cushioning or arch support in the footbed but I have to say that they are surprising comfortable although I will probably add a cushioned insole to them eventually. There were some threads on one of the straps that weren't trimmed well and one of the shoes had what looked like a bit of glue around the heel area, but I was able to brush it off easily. Size-wise I would recommend ordering up one size. While I'm a EU39/US8, I ordered these shoes in EU40, and they are a perfect fit."
4.0,"It is nice.  It is heavy, you could swing it and put a hurt on someone.  Good quality.  Rachets nice."
4.0,Kinda tight I‚Äôm a skinny guy 6‚Äô1 185 and I could close the button just just barely. They‚Äôre cool looking but not loose and flowing
4.0,I love this bra and wear it often because its soft and comfortable however i should have chosen one size bigger because the center connection was chafing my chest so I would possibly caution your usual size.
4.0,"I bought these as additional support for a severely damaged right hand.  Although a little difficult to get passed the scar tissue due to size, once on they feel o.k. and hopefully<br />will help with the swelling.  As with most things, time will tell."
4.0,Very comfy. Very low cut so I wear a cami under it.
4.0,I really love this dress but it was delivered late. I was hoping to have it for a trip I was taking so a bit disappointed. By the time I got around to trying it on (about 30 days later) I found that it's too big. I say order a size down. Really cute
4.0,This belt is very elegant. It is still a bit stiff and I'm waiting for it to soften with use.
4.0,"Bulkier than my wedding band (but hey, I have a flat wedding band). The Mudder is VERY comfortable. I am starting to prefer this over my metal band for daily-wear. The Silicone feels a bit sticky at times though."
4.0,I bought it to wear under one of my little black dresses that had a lovely low neckline but unfortunately it was too large for my chest so instead of giving the perfect silhouette it ended up looking a bit frumpy. I was able to give it to a friend with a larger chest and she enjoys using it for cosplay. I suppose the next one I buy I'll go a size down. Other than that it's an adorable little harness and I'd recommend it!
4.0,Charm fell off ;(
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but I am on the large size and it was to clingy, it's kind of a elastic material. Doesn't flow like in the picture for me."
4.0,Color a little faded but great fit
4.0,Great fit and comfortable.  Looks great with jeans or dress it up.
4.0,These are cute and comfortable but they do roll up during workouts.
4.0,"This crossbody seems well made. The recycled fabric feels durable, and I appreciate that the lighter lining makes it easier to see what‚Äôs in my bag. The main compartment can (just barely) fit a 750 mL CamelBak Chute, and if I‚Äôm not taking up all the space with my water bottle, the three stretchy mesh pockets within that compartment facilitate organization of the sort of small items that would otherwise be jumbled at the bottom of the bag. The flat front zip pocket is spacious, encompassing the full width and height of the bag.<br /><br />This versatile little bag is designed to hook onto attachment points on the outside of WAYB‚Äôs other bags as well as be carried on its own as a crossbody or shoulder bag. It‚Äôs a really neat idea to have modular storage/carry options. I often need to schlep stuff like textbooks and my computer to campus, but once I‚Äôm there, I don‚Äôt want to haul my backpack all day. However, thanks to the curse of women‚Äôs clothing, I don‚Äôt always have pockets for my phone, wallet, keys, lip balm, gum, and inhaler. I‚Äôve tried shoving a small purse in my backpack to carry that stuff, but it isn‚Äôt convenient and takes up room I sometimes need for other items. This lets me expand my carrying capacity by over 3 liters rather than using up existing space, and just detach and go, leaving my backpack in my office. WIth the detachable strap adjusted to its absolute minimum length, I can also wear this as a waist pack, but folks who aren‚Äôt size 14 and up will probably find this impossible. There‚Äôs a grab handle on top for easy and comfortable carrying in hand as well.<br /><br />I find the design of this bag a bit bland, and if I didn‚Äôt also own a WAYB backpack, I think I‚Äôd probably find it a bit underwhelming at the price since I‚Äôve already filled the ‚Äúdurable fabric crossbody with thoughtful organizational features for travel‚Äù niche with Baggallini purses that also better fit my sense of style. As an accessory for a WAYB tote or backpack, however, this is top notch."
4.0,MATERIAL KIND OF THIN.
4.0,"Thiese earrings are beautiful and exactly as pictured. My only little critique is that the backing could be larger or better quality as the earring is on the larger side. But this can be fixed easily. Over all, happy with this purchase!"
4.0,"I too wish they would specify that they only have the one set of colors available, as I ordered these again recently and received the same gray, dark blue, and spotted ones. I know they make different colors as I received them before."
4.0,This dress for well didn‚Äôt have a problem. Only thing about it is I have a big bottom so it made the dress short in the front other than that i recommend it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 200lbs and got a 2x
4.0,"I had a pulmonary embolism two years ago and had to wear one while I recovered. Very tight to get on, but comfortable when worn... think a gentle constant hug, unlike some I wore that were more like a bear trap."
4.0,Fits as expected. These are comfy and I like the color.
4.0,the quality of the jacket was great. We had read someone's feedback that said the size ran small so we ordered the next size up and then it was too big. So it was actually true to size. Nice jacket.
4.0,"The pattern and fabric is nice but I don't see how this could possibly be a dress, it's very short.  I wore it as a top with shorts."
4.0,Super cute dress and very flattering!
4.0,It‚Äôs good quality but strings come off!
4.0,i am normally a M\L I got a large and I defiantly could have gotten the medium
4.0,"This shirt is really cute. I normally wear a large, but ordered a medium because reviewers stated it ran big. I could have probably gotten a small and it still would have looked cute. It is a bit low in the front, but that's an easy fix. Overall this is a great shirt and I plan on ordering another."
4.0,It was beautiful but too tight in the lace arms so I returned it.
4.0,It is a nice shirt but it is a little small. Order a size up.
4.0,the bottoms fit perfect. true to size. the top is a bit small
4.0,I ordered th bright blue one in a medium. I am 5'5 180 and I fit good. It is just short but it does stretch so it can be worn woth high wasted bottoms or tucked in.
4.0,"Usually wear a M, sized up to a L because most reviews advised that... still not really a good fit.."
4.0,"My wife likes this shirt, 2X sizing is accurate and comfortable.  The color is nice, and it seems like a well made shirt."
4.0,"My sister and I bought masks for a masquerade party recently. I got this one with Prime shipping so that's always helpful! :)<br /><br />I made some modifications. I cut the feathers off (which proved a little difficult because the part where the gem is on the front has white underneath on the actual mask, so I had to re-color it in with a Sharpie). But after that, I krazy glued some of the feathers back on to the side of the mask and a plastic piece of an orchid. I loved it!<br /><br />It was really pretty and I got a lot of compliments."
4.0,"Cute dress, doesn't fit like I thought"
4.0,Nice but a bit stiff. Odd smell but not too bad.
4.0,"Comfortable stylish, fashionable and fits as expected."
4.0,Nice bright colors... washes well... looks great on
4.0,Cheap but ok for the money
4.0,"This dress definitely fits true to size, I ordered my usual size large and it fits perfectly. It's very comfy and easy to wear. The fabric actually makes it a little dressier than I expected. I bought this to wear on weekends running errands or just hanging out, but I'll probably use it for work or going out to dinner instead. The color and fabric are really pretty!"
4.0,"I wouldn't call this gold. There's gold on it but it's more of a tan. The sash around the waist is true gold and doesn't match the tan satin straps and criss cross back. Other than that, very cute dress and worth the $."
4.0,great soft sweatshirt
4.0,Material feels super nice cut is lovely. Dislike how it gaps at the boobs below the cleavage snap and above the belt. May install a second snap or maybe some velcro
4.0,"A very nice skirt.  Love shopping on Amazon for all the possible choices.  This skirt was a bit more than I hoped to spend, but the cut and fit of the skirt is exactly what I wanted.  The only criticism I would give would be the fabric is not as heavy or as &#34;true&#34; to denim as I would have expected for the price.  It is a very light denim."
4.0,"Not bad fit. With my chest a good bit bigger than my waist, I'm used to swimsuits being too small in the chest and hanging off my boobs like a circus tent. This one's a bit more form-fitting but they do run small. I went with the sizing chart and it was pretty spot-on. Size 12 pants and double D's and the 3XL fits best. Good suit for the price."
4.0,"Love the concept, but didn't like that the necklace was so thin, and would be hard to replace with a better necklace"
4.0,Guitar Strap was of good quality of really soft leather.  Feels good on the shoulders especially for long play times. The strap adjust with the a portion that goes inside an inner pocket which doubles the thickness and adds to the comfort. the only portion of the strap that seems to have some quality issue are the ends where it appears to be separating from the layers of leather that are bound together.  I have been using the strap for about 6 weeks and will see how long this strap will last.
4.0,"These look so cute, and so real. Only thing is after a while the magnets start to hurt my nose so can't leave them on for too long"
4.0,Size 2X more like XL...but too late to return..threw away packaging..would love a 3X
4.0,Very pretty and was a nice gift
4.0,I like the design and its a little small so had to bend a little to fit but other then that still like it!
4.0,"Nice jacket, was a gift for someone."
4.0,"This dress fit as expected, and looks very nice on. It has just enough stretch to it.  A very comfortable dress for work, or dinner out."
4.0,Use it for work and it is sturdy
4.0,"My son has been wearing these as outside shoes for about 3 weeks now. They seem to be working well, but the eye for the elastic laces has come apart from the shoe. I was not expecting longevity from these shoes, but I did expect a little more time from them. We will keep them, but I would hesitate to purchase them for long or all day use."
4.0,"Excellent product at this price point! To find a welded metal gladiator helmet of this quality for only $25 is a steal. Now, you also get what you pay for - there's no padding inside or a strap or anything to hold it on your head. It does seem to be a bit small for my head (about 7 1/4) but I can still squeeze in. The face guard is held in place with a pair of wires as thick as a wire hanger that I was able to pull off with just a pair of pliars. There is shipping oil on it, but that washes off simply. Next, I'm going to the craft store to find some foam to put in to pad it a bit before becoming a gladiator for a big party. ;)"
4.0,"Not as roomy as what I am used to for a Lacoste Classic size 9, even the length is on the short side. I have older shirts (ten years old) and this one is a good four inches shorter."
4.0,"This is just what I‚Äôve looked for!  I would have preferred that the towel be a bit of a heavier quality.  I guess that you get what you pay for!  Over all, I‚Äôm pleased with the price and quality!"
4.0,Very cute and lightweight! Great to wear to the gym. Love the colors they have!
4.0,not as bright red as pictured in the product photo. it is more of a dark red not at all
4.0,"Good product overall with a pretty cool design, great trade-off between quality and price. In my case, it's for a 7 years old who still struggles with laces so I would suggest thicker laces or a self lacing system."
4.0,Very solid and nice looking ring.  A whole lot of ring for the money.
4.0,I am recuperating from a fractured shoulder and this is the perfect shirt for me now.
4.0,Really cute bra. Would have kept it but it‚Äôs only lightly lined and I felt like it wasn‚Äôt really a ‚ÄúT-shirt‚Äù bra which is what I wanted.
4.0,"Seems to be a good quality belt, only time and use will determine durability.  Really like the ratchet system over the standard hole system.  Allows for incremental adjustments of approx. 1/4 inch."
4.0,Broke but I was able to fix it.
4.0,Nice quality but money clip not tight enough
4.0,I have severe tendenitis and this sleeve is very co fortable to wear. I recommend the product. X x x.
4.0,Fit great will wear it for an upcoming party
4.0,This necklace is small and dainty. It can be worn for any occasion. The Diamond is extra small.  I liked it because its easy to forget that its being worn. The necklace will not turn colors or tarnish. The necklace maintained its gold color even after showing.  I would recommend this  necklace. I purchased the silver necklace set as well... Good luck Ladies‚ò∫üíØ
4.0,Me gusta aun que las esquinas incomodan algunas veces.
4.0,"It's a thin fabric, so this is for lightweight coverage. It's fairly soft and doesn't seem to wrinkle easily. It washed and dried well. The ""model"" is 10 years old and the pullover is for 10-12 years."
4.0,"Falta probar en clima extremo! Parece apropiado y buena calidad. Talla un poco m√°s grande de lo esperado por las medidas. COLOR muy diferente, NO ES una peque√±a diferencia respecto al anunciado. Color es obscuro como muy sucio."
4.0,I am happy with this shirt overall since I still have weight to drop in my gut the shirt seemed short. I am putting that on me. Other than that it arrived fast and fit and feels good as I expected
4.0,"I like the dress, but I thought it would be a bit looser. I am 5'5 and wear normally a size 8/medium dress. Also, the fabric is see-through.  However, with a little jersey dress underneath, I love it."
4.0,"nice ,I wear  it under  my dress clothes"
4.0,This is a beautiful scarf!  Great for dressing up an outfit.  It is very lightweight so used more for fashion than warmth.  Very pretty!
4.0,"Leopard print is an instant mood lifter for me. This dress would have been perfect if it had been longer. The fabric is lightweight and stretchy. The scoop neckline is flattering on curves. There is a high waistline that is accented by ruching down the side of the dress. The front hem has a tulip opening. The overall look is very cute, but the hem was just too short for comfort. It hit me around mid thigh. The fit runs a bit small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 162lbs and a 34G bra size. The large would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Great to have this in my collection.  The XL is slightly tight. More like an L. So I advise order a full size larger.
4.0,Cute little cuppies! My son took the white one and I use the pink one. I put it in my phone when I bought it and it's STILL there! No issues...love it!
4.0,"It is very nice and goes very well with legging. It's color is the same the picture. They should with different color too, I want another that is different color."
4.0,"This suit is well-made and really beautiful. It is the most flattering swimsuit I have ever owned. I'm 5'9"" and 220 lbs and I bought the 4x which fits perfectly. The suit has also lasted a long time and the beautiful color has not faded. The only problem I have with this suit, as someone else mentioned, is that the underwires poke out and are very troublesome. I sewed it several times but they poked right back out. They need to figure out a better way to secure the underwires. I am going to try pulling the wires out now and see how it does so I can begin to wear it again. I miss my beautiful suit!"
4.0,Wish I would've got a different color cause it's pretty cute but very see through. My other complaint is that not all of the straps are adjustable. True to size.
4.0,"These sailors style shorts are nice looking. The fabric is a little on the thin side but that works great if you‚Äôre in a hot environment. I love that they have pockets and they‚Äôre not too short, not too long, just right. I gave them a wash and they are super soft, no lint balls. It has a nice elastic waist with a draw sting.  Perfect shorts for casual wear, but you could dress these up easily with a nice shirt."
4.0,"I took a chance and ordered one of the striped designs. It fits beautifully and has an amazing drape. The quality was so much better than I expected for the price and small amount of reviews so far. But I like it so much that I'm going to order another soon.<br /><br />Update - ordered the openwork crochet design striped one and it's not nearly as soft. Ordered a medium and it's smaller than I expected. Still looks good and I'm wearing it, but definitely not the same quality as the first one I ordered which I now see is out of stock."
4.0,The dimensions given are for the outside of the bag.  The problem becomes that the middle inside pocket pulls the sides of the bag in thus reducing the needed dimensions of the bag.  I bought it to fit a specific book that I need for work and upon receipt...my disappointment is paramount.<br />Love the bag and bag size though.
4.0,"Great, beautiful and comfortable shoes. The only problem is that they are too small. If you plan to get them, order them one or two sizes bigger than your child usually wears."
4.0,"I absolutely love the fine adjustability of this belt. It looks nice, too, but has chipped a bit over the last few years. I easily covered the chips with a fine black marker. Can hardly notice."
4.0,This dress is BEAUTIFUL but no give. If you have boobs size up. I‚Äôm a 36D and had to get a large for the girls. But now the waist is too big. üëéüèΩ
4.0,ordered a size up because of the reviews and it fit a size too big. be careful
4.0,"very comfortable while supportive, the venting is nice!"
4.0,The sleeves are tight on me from the shoulder to the elbow.  I cut the seam and added a piece of same color lace to get it to fit better. I like the style and colors are as seen in the advertisement.
4.0,"It‚Äôs great around the house. I‚Äôm using it as a night gown. But like, going up the stairs I have to hike it up a little or I step on the hem.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre a big, curvy girl, it might hang in such a way that it makes you feel like a potato sack.<br /><br />But! It is comfy and when I toss it on I can do the laundry and throw open the windows and not shock the neighbors! hahaha!<br /><br />Also I have washed it several times and it hasn‚Äôt faded or warped yet, which is a big deal in women‚Äôs clothing for sure. And I have big arms and don‚Äôt find the arm holes to be tight - but also it will absolutely NOT do the drop shoulder thing on me and let me move about. I added a photo of me forcing the drop shoulder, and then one of how it usually sits. And personally I prefer a wide neck on a garment anyway."
4.0,"very nice necklace. shiny, didn't change colors."
4.0,Nice watch. Not water resistant.
4.0,"Heavily padded, not what I was looking for, but nice just the same."
4.0,this was a cute top but I was looking for something a little longer and looser so I did return it but seemed to be a good quality top.
4.0,The top has cinches so you can adjust the fit to wearing with a bulky or more slender material.  The heel seems more solid than I expected.  The lining is a little less than expected but seems sufficient to milder winters.
4.0,"pretty,,,"
4.0,"A bit larger than I visualized, but a good size.  I am able to put a book in it, I love the separation of the pockets. Well made and easy to put over my arm...doesn‚Äôt slide off my shoulder ."
4.0,"Top is too large but it is very nice looking. The material is soft but a thick, heavier material. I ended up giving to a friend since it was too large for me. There was a hole in the side of the shirt atbthe seam, but luckily, i can sew, so i was able to fix the seam."
4.0,"Nice strap. comfortable and I like the addition of extra pockets for batteries, memory cards extra cash, Or even a spare key. The strap its self is very comfortable. However, this is my first time using a strap that utilizes the tripod socket as a anchor point. A bit of getting used to how it hangs but once its all adjusted. Its a breeze to use and it actually makes sense."
4.0,"This is a nice dress but there is a lot of fabric in the skirt.  It is lace all over.  What I love the most is the neck line, very flattering.  Bought it in black and I felt as if I was going to a funeral.  This dress would be prettier in some of the other colors I think.  There's nothing wrong with this dress in my opinion just heavy in the skirt."
4.0,Arrived as pictured. Cute top
4.0,"I picked a nude color which blended with my skin a little too much and it didn‚Äôt look very flattering on my body. Amazing leggings though, the stretch and fabric was amazing very smooth&soft! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and it was the perfect length:)"
4.0,"It‚Äôs really soft and lightweight, feathery even. The only thing I don‚Äôt really care for is how small the collar is. Other than that it‚Äôs great."
4.0,The color is more of a red than wine like i expected but great product love the comfortable material
4.0,"These earrings matched my necklace perfectly, they were the right size and appear very nice for the money."
4.0,Beautiful. A must have
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised. Fit as I expected it would, maybe order a size up if you're worried but I think getting the right sizing is just luck of the draw. I ordered a medium and I have 37&#34; hips and a 28&#34; waist. Medium top fits about a b cup, maybe a perky c. Obviously it's not going to look exactly like the picture but it's pretty close for $7."
4.0,great item accidently returned with another so I'm ordering again
4.0,"Cute glasses, a bit cheaply made but for the price, you get what you paid for.."
4.0,Bought these for my grand daughter and she said she liked them. But they looked too short for her legs. She is tall for her age tho. But I thought they would give some room for her size
4.0,"Nice, warm. Should have bought a different color. The black almost triggers PTSD on some of the veterans I work with. A bit terroristy"
4.0,"This vest provides plenty of heat!  I bought it for a grumpy old man üòâ who is forever cold.  The first day he wore it he actually got hot!  I read the description but somehow missed that the battery pack is not included.  I guess because it says provides heat for up to 12 hours, I thought the battery pack came with the vest.  ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The good news was that I had a spare battery pack that I was able to use.  Since then, no problems or complaints!"
4.0,These boots are absolutely adorable! I ordered then in a 6.5 but actually needed to size 1/2 size up to a 7. But they soo cute and would recommend.
4.0,"The color was not as depicted.  The color.shown for the bag was like a tangerine red when actually it is a a boring, regular red, but I kept the bag anyway."
4.0,only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the material is very thin...but good for hot summer!
4.0,Love my Osiana Star Drop necklace... the color is beautiful.
4.0,"This is a cute scarf and hat set. The yarn of this hat and scarf set is much softer than I expected. The stitches are not your usual knit stitches. There are a few stitch loops that look like they have been pulled for a lack of the correct terminology and they stick out a bit further than the tighter stitches. I will have to be careful with those because if something catches on them, it may pull the yarn significantly. The edges are finished nicely. The hat runs a little small in sizing and does not fit my large head, however, I don't usually wear hats because they interfere with my bangs. Overall, I like it and expect it to keep me warm this winter!"
4.0,"These are nice, lightweight earrings, however the colors in my earrings are not as bright and plentiful as in the picture.  I am somewhat disappointed because I need more color, but I will wear them as I had planned.  (I bought them to be the only earrings I took on a trip to Scotland.)"
4.0,Loved these. Definitely worth the price. Cant wait to see them on our little one.
4.0,"Nice, lightweight. Prevents rubbing that may irritate delicate parts of your feet. They look cute, but I prefer the ankle top version as they feel more secure."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt expect much but was really amazed to see it when it came . Perfect size description and clothing quality better than expected. Will order more
4.0,I bought it in blue and use it inside my handbag or take it alone
4.0,"Very comfy and easy to maintain, the only negative is the material is very thin and if you get it caught on Saturday mething it can create a hole easily.  I wear them around the house, so not a big deal for me.<br /><br />Those are my wife's words, FYI."
4.0,"Giving 4 stars b/c I haven‚Äôt tried them on yet, still healing, but they all came in as said. Sizes seem consistent both width and depth. Very pleased!"
4.0,"Given as a gift, the blade was beautiful with great pattern to the steel. Only issue I had was that the button strap for the handle wasn't aligned properly to fit button while the blade was fully sheathed. I made a quick modification to the loops and was a perfect fit."
4.0,They arrived on time. They are super sexy. I love the look. Perfect for my Halloween costume! They make me feel super tall! The only thing negative for me is they squish my big toes. Maybe after I break them in it won't squish them as bad. Or if I sized up a half of a size they wouldn't squish them.
4.0,They are a little shorter than expected but they are cute and comfortable.
4.0,Slow shipping but good quality product worth the wait for the price
4.0,"I like the gloves.  My only improvement would be to tack the inside liner to the outside shell, so that the liner doesn't come out when you pull the gloves off.."
4.0,"Cute and flattering fit but do note that the fabric is a knit, not t-shirt fabric -- my oversight.  I'm not sure I'll keep this item because it's such a loose knit -- not sure it will maintain its shape."
4.0,Great buy! 4 stars.
4.0,Nice but the shoulder mount thing was too thick and oddly shaped.
4.0,"good looking and comfortable, perfect on July 4th"
4.0,Se puso oscuro
4.0,"This purse is deceptively large. The shoulder strap extends a great length too making it comfortable for crossbody (I'm plus size).  Great quality. The design is exactly as shown - vivid colors. My only criticism is that the zipper doesn't zip wth ease. You have to hold it perfectly straight at one end to pull it at the other. Otherwise, this is a five star bag."
4.0,Runs small but good quality. I will buy a bigger one. Would suggest the same to anyone who orders but good quality
4.0,GM MGBOYGYM Men's Casual Pants Basketball Pants Athletic Running Sport Jogger Pants Workout Joggers<br /><br />These are some decent sweat pants for the price.  They are thinner than other sweat pants i've owned over the years but still keep my legs warm.  Gets to about 34 degree F here.  Material is soft and graphics are clean as shown in the pictures.  They are comfy and a good loose fit and not too baggy.
4.0,"Solid fabric with the printed design only on the inside. the double folding mecanics are cool, but it will never go back into the original packaging.  I envision using it for rain and for sun."
4.0,I've ordered three sets of these to keep and share. They're simple and fun and not at all bulky-feeling as they first appear. One star demerit for inconsistent size and one arriving broken (but repairable).
4.0,"Cute different. But don't look exactly like the picture. They're heavy, so they don't look or feel cheap. Came on time. Fast!"
4.0,"This is a basic, warm, oversized cardigan. The material does tend to shed some yarn fibers here and there, but it is not too bothersome. The cardigan is oversized and cozy, but lacks any real shape or tailoring. If you are looking for something warm and cozy, and not overly concerned with fit or style - this is for you!"
4.0,I really like this dress a lot. If I was about 3 inches shorter it would be the perfect length. I'm only 5' 3&#34; so it's a bit disappointing.
4.0,"Needed this to attend a concert.  Actually looks better/higher quality in person, but the darts (as you can see even in the product pic) are slightly off and the belt/buckle aren't perfect.  I tucked into velvet pants and used a great belt..Worked!"
4.0,"First off, I do like this item. It's hardly traditional, but the Gafeng Men's Utility Kilt with Cargo Pockets isn't bad for the price point. I like the pockets and the sizing seems right (this is style A with the button closures, not the velcro; XXL said 42"" and I generally wear 40"" pants...and the fit is pretty good). I also had no problems getting it on myself (not true with some other kilts), so big bonus there. It's pretty lightweight, although in this 90+ degree summer heat, that's actually a good thing. Some of the buckles do look a bit flimsy, but that's kind of the overall issue with this (you're getting what you're paying for, although the stitching all looks pretty good and it's well put-together). Another big plus is pretty easy case, just hand wash and line dry.<br /><br />Don't expect a heavy, traditional kilt at this price point. I see this as more of a casual garment, good for outdoor activities in warm climates, a few rounds at the pub, maybe a punk show here and there. At 30% polyester and 70% cotton, this is lightweight. It's not going to keep you warm like a wool kilt, but that's fine, as long as you know what you're getting."
4.0,High quality material and POCKETS! Waistline a little high for my shape but super comfy!<br />I‚Äôve ordered the black and the floral pattern‚Äî both are excellent!
4.0,Fit bit bigger than expected
4.0,"Just a heads up...<br /><br />Product Dimensions: 2.5 x 2.5 x 0.5 inches<br /><br />That's the packaging, not the product.  The pin itself is about the size of a nickel.  That said, it's a really nice, quality product... it's just tiny.  I'm docking a star for the misrepresentation of size - I wouldn't have plunked down $11 for something so small had I known it was this small."
4.0,"The socks did an excellent job easing the swelling and discomfort in my lower legs and ankles. However, they are very difficult to get on and off. I have arthritis in my wrists and hands. I traded one discomfort for another. I would not recommend them to anyone with similar problems."
4.0,"Got my helmet today. Looks great a lot vetter then in the pictures. I based the size I bought off the hat size from the chart the have pictured and helmet seems to fit well. A little more snug then I'm used to but still comfortable and once I break in the padding I think it will be perfect. The shaded visor for the helmet seems to feel kinda cheap but still kinda nice to have that feature. All in all for the price I don't think u can beat this helmet. Looks good, feels comfortable, and should do its job."
4.0,Look cheap :)
4.0,"Super cute, soft flowy fabric. It runs a little large."
4.0,I am really glad to find an inexpensive alternative to replacement lenses. I was using scratched Oakley lenses for years because replacement lenses were either too hard to find or too expensive. I bought two sets of the SEEK lenses and they're great.
4.0,Very small but very beautiful.  I bought this is part of a set which I love.  The picture makes it look much larger than it really is though.
4.0,"I ordered a size up based on what I read on the reviews and I should have ordered 2 sizes up. They are still comfortable and I wear them, it's just that the waist band is a little snug (I wear it with a looser top to hide any &#34;muffin top&#34; lol)."
4.0,"Purchased the orange hoodie for when I'm hiking on state game lands. Although it's a little big, it's a nice hoodie but the orange displayed is not the same as I received. The color is really more of a burnt orange instead of a bright orange. Regardless, it's still a nice hoodie and I'll definitely be using it out on the trail."
4.0,"Love these glasses! But, the lenses r not glass, they r plastic!<br />Just FYI. They also need to be tightened or at least mine do, so<br />had to buy a kit. They do come with a soft case which seems to<br />be heavy enough to keep them from breaking. Great price, especially<br />since i usually buy Ray Bans or Gucci which r really expensive."
4.0,"I have somewhat large hips, so I figured that this was the perfect style.  I wasn't expected them to be knee length, and they are pretty big in the bust.  The style is pretty - but you do need a cami underneath otherwise your bra lines show"
4.0,It was more spandex than I realized but it is very flattering.  The blue is more a royal blue than what is looks like in the picture but still perfect for a nice summer dress or add a cardigan for work!
4.0,Just a tad on the short side. Other than that I love it.
4.0,I think these pants are great but they fade after a few washes so don‚Äôt pay no more than $20 for them. Macy‚Äôs sells them at $40 when they‚Äôre not on sale and whatever price Macy‚Äôs sells them for Amazon follows suit so make sure they‚Äôre on sale when you buy them. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 185lbs and the 13 fits perfectly.
4.0,"The padding isn't the greatest. I wouldn't recommend for a 100 mile mountain bike race or anything, but for $20 or less this is a fine pair of pants."
4.0,"I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color.<br /><br />Note that they also wash well in a lingerie bag. I lay them flat to dry but have tumble dried them on low for a few minutes without any issue."
4.0,Would be nice to be able to mix and match top and bottom sizes. Medium quality material
4.0,Nice and beautiful necklace piece. My wife got this to gift someone and they liked it as well.
4.0,I love it.  Perfect size for me.  I am very glad I ordered it.
4.0,"White crew socks are a staple for our son. These are fairly thick, wear comfortably and seem like good quality. Our only wish is that the ""FASE FUNN"" logo at the top wouldn't be so huge... just looks a little weird."
4.0,"I wear this as part of my mermaid swimsuit outfit, yes for actual swimming because it is swimsuit material and perfect for my outfit! Everybody loves it, me too!  They're cool for wearing around town too.  But not so much for actual yoga because they don't absorb and wick away the sweat.  However, they're still pretty bomb."
4.0,I Now have 2 of them I ordered the second one as the first was a bit large. Not the fault of the manufacturer not because I ordered a larger size then I should have. This jacket is worth every penny
4.0,"Frame is too wide, and they dont look the best, but the lenses and protection are phenomenal."
4.0,"""Great boots! But, fit a little bit larger than expected.. "" ~ wife"
4.0,"Still debating if I want to return this or not. I really like it, but the front is a little fringy looking and I don't like that. Also, the grey side shows my stomach rolls more than I like (it's a little clingy). It looks perfect with a light cardigan though.."
4.0,Love design and look.  Material is thin and will wear quickly.  But perfect for a week at the beach.
4.0,Light and roll well.  I like the cover with zippered pouches that cover one side.  I‚Äôm a little concerned about the long-term durability because skin of the cases seem a little flimsy.  We‚Äôve used them once on a road trip and they were fine.  I look forward to seeing how they do with airline baggage handler abuse.
4.0,Really cute but really thin material
4.0,Perfect exchange gift as it is attractive but not cheap looking.
4.0,"Nice T-shirt like material, not a heavy sweatshirt"
4.0,"Nala is a major character in the movie trilogy ""The Lion King."" In the movie she plays Simba's mate, she is also a key character and had been with the movie from the very beginning. Nala is a noble spirit with a good heart. That is why I love this toy, she kind of reminds me of myself, well, as far as her kind heartedness goes.<br /><br />The animal itself is made of the softest and silkiest polyester fiber I have ever felt. Just like the picture shows, as long as you don't lay on her too long, she'll stand up as long as your still. She isn't made of good stitching though. I can tell because I've only had her for about a year, and I'm already seeing threads here and there. However, she is one of the most softest animals you would ever feel. Her eyes kind of remind me of girl scout badges because of the way they're stitched in, and the way they feel.<br /><br />She is actually bigger than 16 inches to me. Which to me, in most cases the bigger the better!"
4.0,Husband really likes this.
4.0,"Really fun fashion piece, especially considering the very very low price.  I happen to like this &#34;rustic silver&#34;, to me almost has an industrial chrome personality.  Recommend."
4.0,Very nice pair of sunglasses. Good quality for the money. Keep in mind that they are oversized...especially for a small framed face.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter, fits as expected. Pretty colors too. My only issue is that the characters feet were cut off by the pocket in the front."
4.0,Good quality. Fits true to size.
4.0,These a pretty comfortable for the price I wear a 11.5 EW and ordered the men's 13 W and they fit fine the only thing is the pull on tab is way too small I can't even fit the pinky finger thru the loop.Other than that they seemed to be well made.
4.0,I would have given 5 stars if it was easier to put cash in and out of the wallet. But other than that it‚Äôs literallt the perfect size for me! I don‚Äôt have any credit cards only my bank cards and a few rewards cards. So this works perfectly for me (: also it‚Äôs so convenient that there‚Äôs a key ring on it. So I can just grab my wallet and keys and not worry about losing it!
4.0,These are expensive but my wife swears by them
4.0,Nice and comfortable. Would purchase again a size smaller. They seem to be true to size.
4.0,"I love love love the brightness of the color. The straps are super cute, and the fit is great. I usually wear a 16/18 or XL in tops. My only complaint is that the cup inserts are round and very puffy, which makes them super noticeable. If you take them out or use different inserts, it's great!"
4.0,I had to return the first one I ordered. I ordered an XL and couldn't get it to zip up. Returned it for a 2 XL and it fit perfectly.  If you have curves I would go two sizes up. I received many compliments!
4.0,"True to size though they fit snug, size up if you want baggy. Very soft. Weight is like a lightweight sweatshirt, they are thicker than I thought they looked in the picture but I really like them! Pants have pockets!!"
4.0,Second one I bought but smaller somehow.
4.0,"Just got them in today, they came wrapped up in a white package inside the Amazon box. Each watch also had plastic coverings over them (like Saran Wrap) which was kind of a pain to get off because they get caught easily between the links but hey, it's for protection so I can't really complain. They all came fine, no scratches, no dead batteries.<br /><br />I am going to coat the links with clear nail polish so as to protect the colors. Definitely feels more like plastic than metal but I don't really care much because I only paid like $13 for these 3 watches and I tend to break watches anyway so I didn't want to spend more on, for example, a Nixon watch. Definitely not going to wear them everyday, I usually wear my black FitBit everyday to track my steps. These are more for when I need to dress business casual or to just class up a casual outfit (i.e. oversized black t shirt and ripped jeans with either the rose gold or gold watch). They're a decent size too, not too big not too small. Look at the pic for reference if you want.<br /><br />Basically they look pretty so I say go for it if you also destroy watches or just want some arm candy without going broke.<br /><br />**will update if anything goes wrong"
4.0,"Not as striking as the picture, but is well made. The dress is somewhat disproportional. I am 5.8 and size 8 of popular american brands fit me perfectly. The waist line on the dress was way too high, the sleeve cut is too small and the sleeves are too tight. Wanted to love is though. It's pretty."
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and the dress is super long. Also, hard to put on without help to tie the back."
4.0,But is is pretty
4.0,"I ordered my regular dress size, a 6, and I see some space in the waist in the back.  A little baggy. I'm 5'7&#34; and 145 to 150 lbs.  Approx. 36-27-38.  Knee length.  It has a nice flattering cut and accents the curves.  Not flimsy or see through.  The style is forgiving for those with stomach pouches."
4.0,Ordered 2T and it was very snug. Order a size up
4.0,I probably should have ordered a larger size...but I still wear the skort so I can't complain!
4.0,"Overall, this is a really cute skirt. My only complaint is that the top fabric could be reinforced a little, it seems like it bunches up. I love that the buttons are done with elastic, so it's easy for me to slip on without having to button a lot. I also get a lot of compliments when I wear it.<br />The red is a tad darker/less vibrant than what's pictured, which is fine by me.<br /><br />It does feel sort of cheap, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,Wear black undergarments.  Pretty dress! Lots of compliments.
4.0,Great quality..ran a bit small
4.0,"These are nice, but a bit too warm. If you need a super warm slipper, then these will be great. They are very comfortable- my son described them as squishy"
4.0,"I love the style and shape of the shirt, but it ran a little small in my opinion. I exchanged it for a larger size and haven‚Äôt had the time to try it as I received it sooo fast."
4.0,Smaller than I expected. The earrings came in a small baggy within a small box. The post were still slightly bent however. I'm still satisfied with this cheap pair of earrings.
4.0,Not bad.  True to size.
4.0,"About half the price of what they are in the stores!  One of the bands looks a little more worn than the others, but other than that, it‚Äôs fine. Very bright blue. Matches with what I was hoping."
4.0,this is the second time I've purchased this type band.  It works fine for the watch my husband gave me the first Christmas after we were married 28 years ago.  It is just a bit stiff but that's the only negative thing I find.
4.0,"Love this shirt. Perfect for any Schitt's Creek fan. Stretchy, comfy, fits as expected and the shirt itself seems to be good quality. The print, however, is already fading after 2 gentle washes (inside out)."
4.0,got these for my bestfriend and I for Christmas and she loved them; she even shed a tear. the only bad part is that the little diamond fell out of my necklace but a little bit of super glue did the trick ! highly recommend
4.0,i got a medium and should‚Äôve gotten a large. shrank a bit. also color is darker than the picture.
4.0,wow they are super tall but confy.  I have not used them for a whole day yet but they are cute shoes.
4.0,"Surprisingly really nice. I totally expected my arms to not fit in the lace, etc...but it fits really well and is super comfortable. The skirt is a little papery-feeling but overall it's a nice and comfortable dress. I usually wear a size 10-12, I got an XL. The lace stretches. I'm a 32H, the front has hidden buttons so you can hide or show off however much you want...and it fits over my chest. The collar can be popped or lay flat. I'm really impressed with this purchase, I'm glad I got it. I'll be pairing it with a thin red waist belt (the belt on it can easily be hidden under a different one, or just cut off...it's decorative only) and red pumps for a fundraiser event I usually wear expensive cocktail dresses to...nobody will notice it's so inexpensive."
4.0,"This is a decent swimsuit for this price. I ordered two from this company and the first fit I did not like and material felt cheap. This material feels okay and I like scallop detail because it sits nicely on the skin and around hips vs digging in, so it‚Äôs flattering. The top is a little big for me, but I would mostly be laying by the pool in this so that isn‚Äôt too much of a concern (I got a M and am a 32B). The green color is super cute and the bottoms fit well - I am athletic build 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 140 lbs."
4.0,like the style but size is off
4.0,"Zipper on the side, but you have to make sure that your lining is correct. I really liked them. And would but another pair. I ordered extra large because of my but and thighs"
4.0,"Fits great, but the fabric is too thin."
4.0,"I searched a lot before finalising on this one, to wear for NY winters. It's super cozy and warm. Soft on the inside and the material feels really good both, on the inside as well as the outside. Only downside is that it is a little too big. According to the size chart and Q&A, I got an L as I'm a 42 chest. But it's too big. I suggest buying one size lesser than your usual size. But if you want a baggy sweatshirt, this is the one!"
4.0,"Overall, this is a great suit. The only complaint I have is the elastic on the waistband doesn't have enough play to get it over my hips without fear of ripping the suit. That same waistband is slightly BIG (I still enjoy the fit) seated at my waist, so it seems this wasn't particularly built for the smaller waist/larger hips combo."
4.0,"Like I said in the title, this is a really good looking tie. The screen printed colors in shades of blue are bright and distinct. The material of the tie feels medium weight for a tie, and it ties a nice, symmetric half-Windsor with a centered dimple fairly easily.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be that the seller consider rolling the tie rather than folding it into tight packaging. The creases from folding for packaging were quite prominent and have yet to smooth out. (pic)<br /><br />It‚Äôs likely that because it‚Äôs polyester, these wrinkles will eventually relax and smooth out. Still overall a nice looking tie. Recommended, but take into consideration that it may arrive with wrinkles that need to be gently smoothed out - four stars!"
4.0,"Owned and loved this model watch in the nineties. When that strap broke, I loved it so much that I continued to carry it as a pocket watch for a long time. Two differences in today's version: the strap is feels softer and more flexible, and as someone else said, the light, which used to shine white and illuminate the whole face, now shines green and lights up just the hour digits, and barely the first of the two minute digits, definitely NOT the second minute digit. So you know it's seven- thirty..... something. They messed with perfection, hence the four stars instead of five."
4.0,great for the price a bit more dramatic in the tint gradient in person.
4.0,The color are very vibrant but the skirt it too long and looks kind cheaply made. But the top is perfect.
4.0,I got it for a Christmas gift for grandson
4.0,Quality materials used for a very stylish shoe.  Happy with the product.
4.0,We loved these - but the tips keep falling off. We've resorted to tying knots in their place.
4.0,Zipper on side is unnecessary and uncomfortable.  I bare with it cause the dress is cute.  It looks more like a costume<br />  I actually had someone ask me that....but with a sweater it is more subtle.
4.0,"I thought it was a tad expensive, but my husband loved it. Plus, He gets comments everywhere he goes."
4.0,"This watch met everyone of my criteria when shopping for an old style [rectangular] automatic. Shape and size were perfect. It had a sweeping second hand rather than sub-dial and the hands were luminous which was a must for me. And it had a date window. So, I had it all from a top notch swiss dealer [Oris]. If this watch needed anything to improve its worth to me it would be the enlargement of the date window! At age 74 it's hard for me to read anything smaller than a 12 point font. This beautiful watch is telling me the date in a 6 point font which means I never know for sure just what the current date is..."
4.0,Very nice! Perfect size!
4.0,There comfortable but thy fit a little to big
4.0,It's nice but no bottoms!
4.0,Absolutely loved these got a giggle out of the giraffes ü¶í
4.0,it is a belt and a buckle
4.0,"I bought a size medium. I think I could have gone a size smaller, but I wasn't going to chance it. I didn't expect to like this dress as much as I did. It's a beautiful green color that is perfect for the holidays. It can easily be dressed up or down. It is soft, roomy, and comfortable. I have a smaller waist and bigger hips and felt this dress gave me a uniform slimmed appearance. I've gotten many compliments on this dress."
4.0,"These ties are very sleek and modern, and look very cool with the right dress shirt/suit combo. The material looks and feels nice, but the only reason i'm rating them 4-stars is because there are a few strings starting to hang off, and I've only wore them once."
4.0,"Super cute bralette, fits better with females with a smaller chest. It shows a lot of back so beware. Looks really cute with high waisted shorts (or other high waisted bottoms)."
4.0,Fit nicely. Good tummy control
4.0,It fit my son as we expected.
4.0,I use these for jewelry. Most are pretty cute but the white daisy looks more like a fried egg than a flower. I actually don't use the white ones for that specific reason.
4.0,"This is a very beautiful comfortable garment for a great price! I'm busty (42DD) and ordered xxl which fit perfect. It doesn't provide support, but the top is snug enough to keep things where they should be, but not constricting. Super soft lace and vivid blue color. Panties were a waste as they were too lg. (just string and triangle lace) Overall great babydoll nightie."
4.0,"These are very cute and hypoallergenic, but they need to be like a centimeter longer"
4.0,I had ordered the items and I only had received 11 out of the 12 durags
4.0,Nice gloves a little small but they are Ok.
4.0,It‚Äôs a great wallet and very thin. It‚Äôs a very minimal and fits great in the pocket.
4.0,pretty but muuuuch smaller than expected
4.0,This is a nice looking watch for everyday wear.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is it is very difficult to set the date.
4.0,"My niece loved it... However she doesn't have 2 right feet. We received two purple shoes of just the right foot. Other than that, it's very cute and adored by kids.<br />I changed my review from 3 to 4 stars because the seller issued me a partial credit. I would've been happy with a left shoe. (ha)"
4.0,Absolutely love these earrings!!! So far they are holding up and are to my standards for earrings...
4.0,"They fit, they're warm, were well reveived, just wish the bottoms were more &#34;skid&#34; proof for the little runner in the slipper."
4.0,"Nice and pretty.  My wife likes it a lot, but small. The pictures do not let the buyer know how small this is. Would not buy again as it is unimpressive in appearance."
4.0,have been using them since two weeks. they absorb sweat pretty well and they are quote comfy even after two washes.
4.0,"I love these hats. Look much more expensive than they cost. Only problem-the size seems to vary-I bought the same size for my husband and son-and typically my husband's head is one size larger. At the price, one really doesn't worry that something will go amiss-as it often does with summer straw hats.The guys seem to enjoy them and enjoy wearing them when they're not wearing ball caps."
4.0,"The color is good, the feel is good, the compression is good. The only drawback is the waist is bigger than advertised. But I bought them for a low low price so I am not complaining."
4.0,Looks perfect.value for money
4.0,So Beautiful and Sparkles so clearly I love it
4.0,Not bad for the price. Material is a little thin and not as flowy as pictured.
4.0,"Wow this shirt is really nice! The material is a little on the thicker side but you can tell it‚Äôs a great quality. I‚Äôm not sure if I would wear this while working out because it‚Äôs a thicker material. I ordered a large in the aqua color. I weigh 150 ibs and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5. I prolly could‚Äôve ordered a medium. I‚Äôm going to order more since I love the back and the quality of the material is super nice.<br /><br />The above review was left when I first received the top and now I have a different view.  The large aqua colored top is too loose around the breasts area, but fits ok in the tummy area.  Then I decided to try a medium in the white & it turns out to be ok in the breast area however in the tummy area it‚Äôs too tight and it‚Äôs almost see through as well. I‚Äôm going to be returning the white top and won‚Äôt be ordering more."
4.0,These glasses definitely block the blue light but they get smudged and scratch easily so need to be handled and stored very carefully.
4.0,"My 5 year old loves this set. It's a little bit big on him (goes over his eyes sometimes!) but it is very cute. The gloves are very very thin, though. I'd have hoped for something a little warmer, but still, very cute set."
4.0,High quality materials that dry quickly.  Not fond of the zipper but it works without settling down during exercise.
4.0,"For this price I decided to take a gamble on this suit. I‚Äôm glad I did. The material is decent, not too thick, not too thin. The fit is spot on. I haven‚Äôt water tested it yet. I will say the pink isn‚Äôt pink but more of a dark peachy orange. That‚Äôs ok but had I known I probably would have gone for the blue option."
4.0,"Somewhat small, I wear a shoes size 6.5 and these are a bit snug."
4.0,No way to hold still under clothes unless you pin it down
4.0,I purchased the bracelet for a graduation gift..for my niece and she loved it ..
4.0,Pretty ring. Buy a size larger than you normally ware.
4.0,The band does not stay in place.
4.0,Very relaxed fit around the waist and hips but close fitting at the bust. Wrinkles easily but I still like it. 30C/32B for reference.
4.0,"20mm is just a bit too wide for my watches; not sure what the standard is.  Otherwise, these are as advertised and the price was good."
4.0,4 stars because the work well. Delivery was fast. Hard to replace and now my sensor pad on controller isn't working.
4.0,"As my first high quality wig, I loved it, it was great for my Luka cosplay. It did tangle after wearing it but that's what you expect from long curly wigs. The color is still vibrant and the curl was beautiful (until it tangled that is.) but it's still wearable."
4.0,"Very attractive piece but it almost resembles a funeral piece if you don't add accessories, such as a belt"
4.0,These work!  And if you lose a pair you have two to back you up!  I'd buy them again for gifts.
4.0,"Great looking, decent material.  Worth the price.  Goes very nicely with the shirt I had in mind."
4.0,Very beautiful earings
4.0,"About 4 of them didn't work straight out of the package.  The kids loved them though.  Great price, would have been better if they all had worked."
4.0,"This shirt runs true to size and was SOOOO comfy! Fabric is soft, breathable, and not see through! I wore it all day and never had a moment of feeling uncomfortable or overheated despite the fact I even went on a trail walk in it. I literally loved everything about this shirt. The only thing I have to complain about was, at the end of the day when I took the shirt off to shower, I found that it had dyed parts of my skin black. Ugh. It did come out with my next shower 24 hours later but that was super annoying.<br /><br />Overall though, totally adore this shirt!"
4.0,"The light isn't the strongest but it's easy to reprogram and it's pretty light and doesn't get in the way much of work. I'm satisfied with the fact that it also isn't a metal or pinching at my wrist, it's flexible and pretty easy to get on."
4.0,Love the material. Got lots of compliments!
4.0,"great for the price, as advertised. Comfortable"
4.0,I was impressed with how quickly they were delivered. I also loved the quality for the price. The only thing is they were a little larger than I was expecting.
4.0,"These are good quality, soft, but rather thin.  We'll have to see if they are long lasting.  The pattern is a nice change from the all white ones offered most places."
4.0,Polishes nicely ! Been looking for a new one of these for a while and the price is excellent!
4.0,"For reference, I have purchased¬†the medium size. I am 5'ft/5 inches, with a calf measuring 13 inches, and an 8 inch ankle. These sleeves are not tight, but do offer ¬†moderate support. As only one leg is affected, I do have the option of wearing a double layer should I require additional support. Time will tell. For now, I am pleased with this purchase."
4.0,I bought this dress and when it came in it had black marks all over it so I returned it and ordered a new one. When the new one came in I quickly looked it over and it seemed okay but when I put it on I noticed it had the same black marks all over the side this time. I am returning this one as well and will not be buying another one. The dress was so soft and cute tho :(
4.0,"These Pjs are a little on the small,size . They give no growing room. They fit , but added growing at this age , leave no room to grow. Very colorful and lightweight."
4.0,"Masks fit well for adult and teen, the strap is not to tight."
4.0,I like them and intend to order more. I only gave 4 stars because they are hard to attach.  They have no spring clasp to open and grip your glasses when closed. That makes them tight to put on. But the coverage is great.  Goes completely across my 61mm lenses. That's rare. Thanks.

4.0,These socks are soft and comfy. The colors are nice and not too overwhelming. The fit along the foot and calf is good and would be a good size on anyone. The fit for a short person looking to have just a knee high sock without going up to the middle of your thigh??...........not so much. Way to long .
4.0,This dress is super cute! I would of given it five stars but something weird is going on in the clevage area where the pleats are located. I am 5‚Äô2 180lbs with a B cup and a 40inch booty. I purchased a large because I was readying the comments to go up a size. The large fits everywhere but in the boob area. I am trying to decide if it needs to be taken in under the armpit or if it can be altered around the shoulder area. The length is perfect. The material is thick and is perfect for a wedding or date. Not an everyday dress.
4.0,"Love these so much! Super cute and very comfy! I normally wear a 7.5, but ordered and 8 and they are a smidge long, but the straps fit perfectly."
4.0,Cute gymnastics leotard. Nice material and fits well.
4.0,"really cute, to small"
4.0,Hakama (pants) do run longer than needed. Could use at least one pocket in the top but if you're skilled you could sew one in.
4.0,Very soft fabric. Runs a bit large. I would but it again in a different size and pattern.
4.0,Beautiful did not hold up it break after 3 wear
4.0,"This is a good bag but it's just not an exciting bag.  The leather is superb, and the size is great, but it was just too boring.  I sent it back.  Perhaps if it had come in a brighter color, I would have kept it.  Hobo has been using that awful dry 'glazed leather' for so long that I'd almost given up on them, but this bag is made from a nice supple leather that I liked."
4.0,Very comfy...should have went up a size for the loose fit I wanted but I love it.
4.0,We received the pink one (was hoping for yellow but oh well) and it is super cute. The large is the perfect size for my 8 year old. It will go perfectly with our American Girl outfit we are putting together to match Kirsten. We gave it 4 stars due to it is very thin material and doesn't look like it will hold up for to long and the giant &#34;Made in China&#34; tag on the straps is very annoying.
4.0,It‚Äôs smooth
4.0,"Didn't care for look of fringe around ankle, fringe down the side would have looked much better I think."
4.0,Fun jacket...Thin and arms run short. Will have to put bew sleeves in. Not worth it for all the alterations you'll have to make.
4.0,Great item if needed to put on a braclet
4.0,"EDIT: The first band I ordered was very flimsy and the home (left) button did not work properly and nearly broke the first day I got it, but that might have been a simple manufacturing error because the second band works fine and looks great as well. These bands are nice, look good, and are great for the price."
4.0,I use for work because I can‚Äôt have on my wrist... occasionally the watch flips over as it gets loosened but overall üëçüèªüëçüèª
4.0,"The white part of the swimsuit is very thin and can be seen through. They run a little small, but still fit. The net is not very comfortable, but due to the white being see through, we have not cut it out. These have been worn multiple times."
4.0,"Band is nice, design is perfect, material is excellent and it fits well."
4.0,Love the look.  They sure are silly socks but they are not very comfortable.  The socks are in something you'd want to wear all day but are good to wear for a few laughs.
4.0,Provides good cover from head and over the neck.  Will see how long it lasts in the field
4.0,"My husband is 6'2 and the sleeves are just a little short for him, but he's a Whovian and doesn't care much. If you are larger person, you will probably have difficulty. We run into this problem with just about everything off the shelf. If he wants a good sleeve length he needs to shop in the talls."
4.0,"Well made, very comfortable"
4.0,"My grandson loves this outfit, but the lettering started coming off after a few times in the dryer."
4.0,"Very cute fit was great, a little long but that's what I wanted!! I stupidly dried it and it's know knee length!"
4.0,I got the ‚Äúred‚Äù which is way whiter than in the pic.  The fit is perfect. The length is great but it‚Äôs a little see through.
4.0,It great for work. It allows me to carry everything I need
4.0,Runs small fast shipping good looking hat
4.0,Lovely. Bought for my 10 yr old daughter and she loves them.
4.0,Just opened the package and this fit my 18 month old with some room to grow. She loved the tutu and the gems. Perfect for her first ballet class
4.0,Fits well. Good for fall wear. Allison
4.0,This dress was really pretty but it was a little too small around my hips/stomach area so I had to send back. :(
4.0,"I finally put it on this days with the first rainy days; since the price is at the top (like arcterix, let's say) the expections were high. Fit is good due to the stratcy fabric, it is poly, then softer and smoother they nylon 40D without been bulkier. It is not sturdy like nylon though. DWR not fantastic. ventilation good breathability decent. Probably like goretex or so. I  like the look, not so thechnical cobsider that it is a specific piece. It seems shedding water pretty good.  Averall 4 star"
4.0,i have to say.... these were very creepy.... my nephew loved it!<br />the strap that holds it on is more for an adult head... but that is super easy to adjust
4.0,"Update:  6/3/2019.<br /><br />After 6 months it wore out.  Dropping to 4 star rating. Thought I'd get closer to a year.  I think the additional wear came from various creases caused from the stitching process.  These particular areas of creasing were along flex areas of the apron.  I.e.  bending and stooping forward and side to side over time caused these areas to wear thin and finally tore through.  Front of pockets included.  Please keep in mind that this apron was only hand washed and air dried.  Another drawback was that the adjustment straps were passive through the grommets.  Being passive I had to tie off the height so as not to cause the top edge portion of the apron (between chest and armpits) to ride low and across my nipples.  Causing irritation.<br /><br />I'm a CNC machine operator.  I searched for a waxed apron for a considerable amount of time before deciding on this product.  What I was looking for were a minimal amount of pockets.  Pockets are metal chip collectors.  And a black apron with a clip connector to secure behind my back.  I don‚Äôt have time to deal with tying or untying knots for that matter when I‚Äôm working.  This apron fit the ticket.  I gave it 5 stars because it‚Äôs worth it.  The only modification I needed to do was tie knots in the strap that goes from around the shoulders to behind the back.  The photos in the description didn‚Äôt show that the strap is passive.  Meaning that when and where you clip it behind yourself controls how high the apron itself is located on your chest.  I took that out of the equation and simply put knots between the back clips and the grommets.  This fixes the wearing height to where I want it.  Please refer to photos.  The apron looks shiny because I just finished hand washing it with laundry detergent and cold water in our utility sink and air dried it.  Don‚Äôt machine wash.  You‚Äôll tear it up.  I reapplied a beeswax coat and set it in with a hair dryer on high heat.  And wiped off the excess.  It‚Äôs a very functional apron.  The only upgrade I can think of would be to add cover flaps over the two lower pockets.  I really like it and am very satisfied with it.  Remember it‚Äôs waxed, not water proof so it will get damp if working with liquids for a period of time, but not soaking wet like an unwaxed apron would.<br /><br />Paul"
4.0,Like the colors and really easy to use. They did stretch just a bit when wearing for longer periods of time (whole day) but great for gym workouts.
4.0,"i'm 5'9 and weigh 170<br />i'm muscle though, not just hefty.<br />i wear size 8 when i wear pants<br />medium sparkly tops when i do the safety dance.<br />this is large in the waist and doesn't help a girl out<br />makes it look like my belly is large so i pout.<br />otherwise it's great and i love cats a lot."
4.0,Cute but tiny.
4.0,"Before ordering prescription sunglasses decided to try out these Caxman clip-ons first. Initially ordered the silver tinted lenses. They worked very well for driving & most outdoor activities. They clip on & off quickly, provide clear vision & UV eye protection, are stylish & super lightweight plus come with a compact storage box to protect & store when not being worn. Being around water so much decided to order the blue tinted lenses as well. This color reduces reflection from water & sun glare improving the enjoyment of this sort of outdoor experience.  Affordable and good value. Gave it four stars because I needed two different lens colors."
4.0,This was a good fake nose rose but when I breathe in it got stuck in my nose and I couldn't get it out till I went to sleep and it feel out of my nose . And I was in school when it got stuck the nurses couldn't get it out so it was they for at least 8 hours.
4.0,"This is a great product! We used them for our kids on their masks for school. They were able to take them on and off and not lose the mask. The only small issue we had was that, after a while of wear, the plastic hook pieces separate and allow the lanyard to slip off. It doesn‚Äôt happen when the lanyard is tightened, and only occasionally."
4.0,"Dress was nice- easily washable which is great for me. Fit was perfect- it did shrink just a little after the first wash but I always expect that so I did size up a little. The neckline is a little high for me, not as low as I usually prefer but makes a nice conservative look. I prefer it with a petticoat underneath to give it some flair, otherwise it falls a bit to flat looking... but you could get away with that too.. I just prefer the poofy look. Great dress all around for the price."
4.0,"I like it and have received several compliments.  However, being a little OCD, it's hard to keep the sequins turned the same way.  I'm constantly looking at it to see if any are turned ""wrong"""
4.0,Its different from what I've seen in stores. love it. I usually use a large and it fit me a little big
4.0,Definitely a large torso waist trainer fits great and is pretty comfortable Im only 5'2 but I have a long torso and I got a large since I wear a size large in tops only downside was that one of the hooks already came loose but for the price its great I will be ordering another in a size medium since I can already wear this one on the tightest hooks
4.0,"The tanks fits great, no complaints"
4.0,"The earrings I received are a mottled tan and very dark brown.  The earrings in the picture and description are amber and brown, true tortoise shell colors."
4.0,"Awesome, looks cute and fits larger boobs well."
4.0,"These socks are comfortable, and provide good support. I have PTTD and find wraps constricting to the point my foot becomes squished due to excessive binding. Only gave it 4 stars because there is a run in the material in a key part for my foot condition. It's got me feeling like the sock won't hold up as it should. I will report back in a few more weeks.<br /><br />Socks held up fine and are still going strong some years later!"
4.0,"Love the bag but, when you shorten the strap, it needs belt loops to hold the strap down."
4.0,Cute pin to add to my collection. A bit smaller than expected but it seems to be good quality.
4.0,Wore the dress for New Years!! And it was gorgeous! Lovely color and very full and fluffy skirts. The sequins are sewn in well and my daughter loved the sparkles. The only downside is that the hem in the skirt started to unravel by the end of the night.
4.0,"The quality is good, my only issue was that the end was too large for the pendants I am using."
4.0,i like desine and color
4.0,I really love the jacket although it‚Äôs very thin
4.0,"Love this dress! The only thing is the back is see through (I expected it in some way because of it being white) easy fix. But it is super comfy, and cute!"
4.0,"There was no tag on the shirt so you'll have to be mindful of the way the collar sits. Not a deal breaker. The size was true so I didn't have to return like most things these days. The material is lightweight and didn't cling to me while I slaved away in the hot sun. It's kind of a silky material so if you have a sensitivity to that type of feel on your skin, I wouldn't recommend. Used them while I was gardening to keep the sun off me without having to be slathered in sun block. Didn't pretreat the shirt and all the mud and dirt came out in a normal wash. I was in direct sunlight for hours and no burns for this Scotsman!"
4.0,Ordered for a corpse bride Halloween costume.  Much better quality than I had expected for the price!  Plan on wearing something under this because the whole thing is super see through.  Got lots of compliments on it though!
4.0,"I've been trying, very unsuccessfully, to find sports bras that comfortably fit a 44DD chest for over 2 years with no luck. Finally, these fit well but barely. I had to remove the padding to avoid the squished/flattened look but once I did, they fit pretty good. I have a hard time believing they would fit anyone larger than 44DD"
4.0,After wearing like three times strings start hanging out.
4.0,"This is a really cute top I wanted to being to Hawaii later this year.  It, however, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhand‚Äù as nice as it does on the model.  I am large breasted with a tummy and although it seemed ok across the chest, it just accentuated my tummy.  Sadly, I had to return it."
4.0,Needed these for back up and they worked very well!!
4.0,The pocket watch glass display  was perfect for the size and area in which I am displaying it.  It arrived as promised in the description and on target as to delivery.
4.0,"It was given as a gift to my nephew he has not complain, he loved it."
4.0,"A little disappointed with the fabric. Thought these would be a little heavier, fabric wise. The fit was very good. Took a bit long to arrive."
4.0,"If it had a better hem/edge to it I'd give it a better score. Also, you can get them cheaper, but I liked this pattern so I paid the extra. It's thinner than I expected, but it works as described, so it's good. It keeps my hair out of my eyes, which is really all it needs to do anyway. It arrived on time and everything, so the seller got the job done right. :)"
4.0,A little smaller than I thought it would be - but my 7 yr old niece loves it!
4.0,"These are beautiful cufflinks, but they are not nearly as blue as the photos show. They do lean toward blue as opposed to other colors in the spectrum, but I was expecting them to be much deeper."
4.0,I brought it for my friend‚Äòs daughter. She is turning to 2 years old. The size is right and the color ie elegent. The little girl likes the dress. It is pretty and cute.
4.0,"Toe socks are great if you wear vibrams or if you get blisters pretty easily.  I am prone to getting blisters so these socks are great with protecting the in-between toes areas.  They're a bit of a pain to put on since you have to position each toe into each toe socket but it's worth the extra couple of minutes of effort.  Since getting these socks, I have since purchase at least a half a dozen pairs and I haven't gotten a single blister since.<br /><br />These are my official go to gym socks."
4.0,These are great however the picture isn't quite right. Really wanted an American flag gator however there's a big 4th of July written all over this. Not describe this way not pictured this way.
4.0,"This product fit as expected. It's very comfortable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is my issue solely. It's a one piece and I guess I thought it was 2 piece when purchasing. It was 10.00 when I bought it so I got nothing to complain about. I'm 5'3"" and it fits me nicely!"
4.0,"I was hoping the dress was a bit different but still nicely made, not cheap china stuff"
4.0,Liked the looked but returned it was too small for me
4.0,The toe area is not very comfortable for my long toes.
4.0,Light weight yet looks to be expensive. All the pieces seem delicate so you would def. Have to handle with care. Good price for sure
4.0,Actually  the picture  does  this ring no justice.. its absolutely  gorgeous. . Bought for my boyfriend and he feel in love  with it.
4.0,I think my Granddaughter will really like this unique bracelet.  it's  really one of a kind that I've seen.  Great idea..
4.0,"It could be comfier, and it also gradually got flatter over the year and a half I used it. It was unfortunately stolen off my bike, but it did its job."
4.0,"Fabric feels great! Heavy and smooth, drapes really well BUT the arm holes are tiny in comparison to the overall size of the dress...I could have sized down overall but arm holes were too small on the medium to go down more..."
4.0,It would have been better if the lunch bag was a tad bigger other than that It‚Äôs a good purchase
4.0,Love the built of these boots a little bit big
4.0,Good fit.  Nice pair of slacks for work.
4.0,"Wish I had known that they were reprocessed cotton, not virgin cotton. Had they been I would have loved them."
4.0,Great fit. Definitely has a bad smell when first open it. Threw it in the washer machine and it went away
4.0,These pants are really comfortable. Very stretchy. Only thing I didn't like was that they are more yellow/skin colored than khaki colored.
4.0,"I looked at so many face masks I was dizzy.  Let's face it, the decent ones are not what we would call cheap; but what is your safety worth?  Technically you get 5 for $25.00.  Even around town this price is great!  I received shipment within two days as promised,  Product seems well made, nose wire very sturdy, adjustable ear loops, an ""ear saver"" strap and washable!  I love the under sectioned-chin portion as it keeps the mask in place and comfortable WITHOUT you touching it all the time (which is a no-no).  I have had problems keeping a mask from rubbing up into my eyes.  This fits great and don't think it will shimmy up!  I have hand-washed and hung to dry.  They didn't come with filters but that's okay; I ordered separately.  It's sad to think covid is going to get worse before it gets better.  I cannot afford to be unprepared.  Thank you for your product and timely shipment.  If need be I would order again.  Be well.  Susan"
4.0,Read all the reviews so I knew what size to order. They are very supportive and do not squish you.
4.0,Durable well made
4.0,"Seemed large when it arrived, but it actually fit me perfectly.  Medium was appropriate for my size 10 body.  It is soft and comfortable.  I love the pockets.  Perfect for a work-appropriate Halloween costume."
4.0,"Pretty nice looking, wife said she liked it very much.  Product was received quickly with no damage."
4.0,"Seems well made for the price, though it was too small."
4.0,I receive this pshirt within a couple of days. The quality is good and is very nice and affordable.  I would say it runs Tru to size ND will be ordering more in other colors.
4.0,Really really big. But cute
4.0,This dress is a good fit! Fun to wear by itself or with leggings and a jacket. The material is thicker so no worries about it being see through.
4.0,Great shirt for everyday wear. Make sure to order a size up if you are fuller through the bust. I am ordering another.
4.0,"I bought these so I could have an unobtrusive but cute earring that I could sleep in. I wanted stainless steel because I am dealing with some old ear piercings in which I have not regularly worn jewelry in awhile, and they are sensitive at the moment. Stainless steel is inert and I could wear it until these piercings calmed down. I don't understand the claims that the earrings are too small: they are the size advertised, and they are just right to wear in an earlobe piercing.<br /><br />I am mostly pleased with these earrings. However, they are NOT as pictured. The photo is of earrings with a slight bevel; the earrings I received have no bevel. I would have preferred the beveled shape, as it is more feminine. I'm not thrilled with the shape of these. The shape is blocky.<br /><br />For some reason, one of them had a lot of black powdery crud on it when they arrived. I washed it off, but it was very hard to remove. It was sticky.<br /><br />The worst thing about them is that the end of the thick part, where it leads into the wire, is square and has a very blunt edge. This makes it really easy for shirts, aprons, necklaces, etc to get caught on that part of the earring and then jerk the earring. This is very painful. For that reason I don't think I will keep wearing these after the piercings have healed up.<br /><br />On the positive side, these earrings are very easy to open and shut. It was a little tricky getting them into my ears as the wire is so short. Once they were in, though, they closed securely and have not popped open. They are serving the purpose for me, and they were inexpensive."
4.0,"The dress is pretty nice; it even has pockets. I washed and dried on extra low in my home machines; it‚Äôs low maintenance clothing. I got the small for a 4‚Äô11.5‚Äù, 105 lb person and it fits kind of loose but not so loose it‚Äôs baggy; with a belt and low fluff petticoat it looks nice. I‚Äôll add pics next time my kid wears it.<br /><br />***However, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but amazon keeps sending me used items and the dress I received was obviously a return. It was in a bag marked LPN, didn‚Äôt have tags (this brand always puts tags on their clothes), and it reeked of perfume. Kind of gross, but it‚Äôs machine washable so I just washed it."
4.0,"Heavy, but good quality."
4.0,Size fit smaller then most larges.  But love the product
4.0,The one I lost was a tad stretchier in material. It framed my body better. This one has a wide fold around the collar and all the way to the edge in the front. It‚Äôs a lot of extra material and has me feeling frumpy when I wear it.  It also wrinkles a lot more than my other. I loved the one I lost so I‚Äôm a little was this one doesn‚Äôt stack up.<br /><br />I do like the unevenness being in the front though. That‚Äôs what had me order this one over similar.
4.0,I was happy to get these cozy mittens in the mail just as the weather is turning cold here in Wisconsin. The faux fur leopard print is fun and casual. More importantly the mittens are warm. hand part is roomy while the wrist bands are a little more snug to keep cold air out and to make tucking into sleeves easier. No cold hands while walking the dog this winter! (As long as I don't need to use my phone!)
4.0,Nice fit. Do not put in dryer.
4.0,"It's really beautiful! I have it in black, I usually wear a 10/12, I ordered a Large, and I want to buy it in a lighter color for the day! Super nice, especially if you're curvy like me!<br /><br />-Maggie"
4.0,The ring is nice and of good quality. There was some instructions in the box along with an email that states if I have questions or problem to not leave a bad review to email them first so they can take care of it. Well I had a question about the instructions included in the box and quickly emailed and still have not got a reply. this is the reason I am giving it product a 4 is because if I actually had a problem they would have never replied and thankfully the ring is nice and it fit.  Hopefully most will order thru amazon so they will have a resourse in returns and problems.
4.0,These are cute! Definitely a fashion sunglasses. You can tell they are cheap but they are super cute. I would wear them on vacation to the beach where I wouldn‚Äôt worry about loosing them.
4.0,"Great quality......just slightly snug around the center.  I‚Äôm a Big n Tall guy, 6‚Äô4‚Äù 265lb. Love the design and feel of shirt."
4.0,"I really love these workout pants and they're my second pair of Queenie Ke.  The brand itself is really impressing me.  The quality is excellent - even the mesh and stitching - I'm soooo impressed - and at this price.  The only reason I give it a 4-star is that with the stirrups I find it pulls the pants down from the waist when I'm moving.  I don't do yoga or anything but I run and I do a lot of weightlifting and I like the full-coverage in the winter.  When I'm doing squats, for example, I feel them pull.  But - I'm 5'7 - I know not crazy tall, but taller than average.  So that might have a little to do with it.  If there was a &#34;long&#34; option (I didn't see one) that would be awesome."
4.0,If you want something that covers your arms then this is perfect.  Nice but plain and does not detract from your outfit.
4.0,"Super cute and very comfortable,  but the top was stretched too much making it see through. Returned. A larger size would be too large every where else. Dresses are always hard to get the fit right. 140lbs, 5'5, 34G"
4.0,"It's a cute dress, but not as full and flowing in the skirt as it appears.<br />It's a little smaller than American sizing.  I recommend following their specific size chart for this dress.  I'll reorder, sizing up one size.<br />It's 95% cotton and 5% spandex.<br />That makes it very comfortable.<br /><br />One recent review mentioned it has a zipper, but mine doesn't.<br /><br />The pastel pink color is pretty.<br />It's a little low, showing some cleavage."
4.0,"good shoes, wish I had gone down 1/2 size or even a full size but even loose still work good for wearing around. Pretty comfy!"
4.0,My boys love their new belt.
4.0,"Muy buena calidad en los materiales, las sisas muy aviertas"
4.0,Not for carrying heavy stuff.<br />Good customer service.
4.0,"I purchased it for my NECK. I like the circle, which can't be seen because it will NOT stay flat."
4.0,"Used this for a super cute Mario cosplay, they're a little flimsy and can stain easily, so just be careful with what you hold or touch while wearing them and you'll be fine."
4.0,Good sunglasses good seller
4.0,These arrived quickly and were good quality. They were however somewhat tight and I have a thin build. They came to right above my knee. Overall I was still pleased with the purchase.
4.0,"Loved the way this fit and feels! The only thing I don't like is that I can't wear a shirt with a key hole back because you can see the straps. Other than that, it's great!"
4.0,"I read the other review that said their flag was not double sided.  Mine was.  The only problem that I have with it is that it is pretty thin.  It looks fine in my yard, though.  I would purchase it again."
4.0,Great workout shirt or around town.
4.0,This is super cute and comfortable. Love that I can dress it up and wear it with heals or dress it down and wear it with sneakers. Runs a little bigger but I wasn't sure what to expect so I ordered the small and a medium. The medium is too big for the dressier look I was going for but the small was perfect. Not too tight yet just enough to contour my curves. The medium could work well if you're going for a looser leisure look with sneakers....Either way I love it!!
4.0,Works and was considerably cheaper than alternatives - bought four (4) because they always wear.
4.0,This is a great wallet. I wish it was a bit smaller but it's just perfect for me.
4.0,"Love the shoe's, they look very cute on, they must run a little large, but that gives my daughter room to grow, the velcro however is a little weak and does not stay attached on one she and she has only tried them on so far, i'm planning to put snaps on the straps and remove the velcro"
4.0,Very nice look.
4.0,I liked how flattering the dress was but I was disappointed in the color. I ordered maroon and the dress is bright red.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 28 waist, 35 hips, pant size 6. I ordered these in a medium. The fabric is a good thickness and has stretch to it. The colors are bold and vibrant and the inseam isn‚Äôt too short. They feel a bit mire snug in the waist than I anticipated, given the size chart provided by the manufacturer, but they aren‚Äôt too tight. My biggest issue, and why I took away a star, is because while wearing them I feel like I got a constant wedgie. Other than that they‚Äôre pretty comfortable lmao. In fairness I do have a squat butt, and it‚Äôs not so bad where I won‚Äôt wear them again. If you got a big butt you might want to consider sizing up to prevent this."
4.0,"Cute style...although I normally would order a medium I went with large because I wanted it to be longer on my &#34;older&#34; legs. Design is great, material is not what I expected...but should work well in summer heat as it feels water resistant."
4.0,"I didn't expect a lot when I ordered this item, but was pleased when I received it. The item was well constructed. I don't worry about the zipper or wrist strap breaking like I do with some other wristlets, which is a plus. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a small zippered part on the inside of the lining. I can carry a thin wallet, keys, lip balm, and my phone without the purse looking like it's going to pop, so there is plenty of room for those of us who don't carry the entire house with us to the grocery. Great item overall."
4.0,"Bought these for a 10 hour flight after tearing my ACL and my doctor being concerned about blood clots. These are not the most comfortable, but I expected that with compression leggings. They came with a weird built in boy-short style underwear that was honestly just super uncomfortable and difficult to get to lay flat so I cut it out. They worked for what I needed them for but if I need compression garments again or need to use them for an extended time I'll probably get something nicer."
4.0,"This skirt is beautiful. Nice fabric, comfortable, and flattering."
4.0,"I liked the sterling silver round blue earrings. They arrived very quickly. The size, however, is somewhat small for my ear and face but they are very good quality."
4.0,"I love this cute little bodice, and was excited that it comes in larger sizes! Runs slightly smaller than expected. Luckily corseted clothing is somewhat customizable, so it was okay. Just very snug."
4.0,"I love being able to leave my phone because I have a watch on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It‚Äôs really cute and fits my wrist nicely (I have the wrists of a 6 year old). It still works after being submerged in water a couple of times.<br /><br />Cons:<br />However, this watch didn‚Äôt last too long. I had it on for maybe a month before the band that holds the excess leather broke. So, the durability for ‚Äúwater resistance‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly true. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôd wash dishes with it or anything crazy like that. I did leave it on a couple of times (accidentally) while showering though, and I assume that‚Äôs why the band broke. BUT if you‚Äôre not like me, and will remember to remove the watch when needed, this watch is a good buy for the money :)"
4.0,"Nice sweater, warm and comfortable. Only complaint is it stains very easily and doesn‚Äôt come out even with oxy clean. Which isn‚Äôt an issue I‚Äôve ever had before with other north face products."
4.0,"Once you remove your glasses for the first time, they will not fit back into the hard case, very weird."
4.0,"Purchased this for me but my granddaughter keeps wearing it to school, she really likes it and it looks good on her but it‚Äôs too big for her so she ties the bottom up with a hair bow and it looks good, keeps her warm."
4.0,"Tee will be nice for the summer, just wish it would get here sooner, then later, Live in Taos, NM at 7,000 feet."
4.0,I bought this leg warmers for myself and they are tight on my calves so I wear them kind of scrunched down.  They do fit my 11 year old perfectly.  They are warm - we wear them around the house in the morning before it warms up.
4.0,Buen material y buen servicio
4.0,I wish there were more colors of this dress! I just love how the style fits me perfectly! I didn't give it 5 stars only because the fabric is not that fantastic
4.0,Excellent buy. Nice detail. Big enough for shopping but not bulky.
4.0,I have used these gloves several times now and so far so good. They seem to be well made  and I like the extra protection added to the thumb and forefinger
4.0,Really cute and comfortable.  The bead work isn't too heavy.  Looking forward to wearing this on an upcoming cruise.
4.0,The first pair I ordered ripped at the crotch the first time at the field- are you kidding? For $150? Returned them and got a replacement- seemed to hold up on first wear. We‚Äôll see...a little nervous. Not what I expect from HK and that kinda $$. That aside...they fit great and are very breathable. Totally disagree with the review that says they‚Äôre not breathable. I live in FL and they were fine.
4.0,The rings were very small definitely just for small fingers I needed them for a bridal shower wished they were a bit bigger in the ring part but loved the different color jewels and shapes
4.0,"Clings to clothing easily, thus sticking to other people. But that is jewelry. Absolutely perfect accessory and easy to untangle!!"
4.0,"The glasses are great if you need help with glare and different light problems.  My only complaint is that they fit a bit snug.  I wear the polarized ones everyday, but have not worn the night specified glasses.  They also weigh heavy on my nose and I am constantly lifted them up for a moments relief from the pressure.  But  I would still recommend them."
4.0,"Not great quality, but I guess for the money it's not bad. Time will tell how well it'll hold up to sparks and such. The fit is good and I like that it is actually as shallow as it appears in the photo - thankfully not one of the cone-head variety that tends to be the norm in these kinds of caps."
4.0,"It's ok,"
4.0,Love it! Great price.
4.0,Fit very small<br />But love the Kik and feel of blouse
4.0,"I bought this to wear to a Christmas party and it is exactly what I wanted.  However, when it arrived it was not packaged very well and is one big wrinkle, otherwise I would have rated with 5 stars.  Have not yet had a chance to use a steamer on it but sure hope it works!  Label says &#34;Low Iron&#34; so I may try that first."
4.0,I was skeptical about buying leggings online without trying them on. I wear Nikes all the time but even those I‚Äôd have to try on. I‚Äôm really pleased with the leggings. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 120 lbs & ordered a small. Perfect length & control is right to where you‚Äôre still comfortable. It is not sheer at all & material is very nice. Not sure if it‚Äôll snag easy though. I ordered a second pair in camo.
4.0,"This shirt is light weight and wonderfully cool in hot weather. For fishing or kayaking or just being in the sun, it is the best one I have found for the price. Priced reasonably. The only flaw it had was that one side seam was not sewn into the seam so I had to stitch it myself. It was easy to repair and I wouldn't give up the shirt long enough to get it replaced. I will purchase this shirt again and possibly use it as a gift for my outdoor friends and family."
4.0,The shirts are light weight. They are wash and wear. Perfect for summer wear.
4.0,The quality and price were both very good. I bought them to update my current black tie
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress!!! Truly beautiful, made well and so fitting. Unfortunately, I have a bright future behind me that would have my future visible to the world due to the split in back. Once I drop a few pounds, this dress and I will be back with photos!!!"
4.0,Material felt good. Was not true to size. Hooded sweatshirt is true to size though.
4.0,"These changed my husband life, no more terrible leg pains after a long day on his feet"
4.0,A little big underarms and a little low cut.  But wore to a wedding.  Loved it!!  Great price
4.0,"I loved this dress! I gave it four stars because the fabric feels cheap but as far as looks and wear goes it was perfect for a last minute wedding guest dress. I also had to use a Bobby pin to fasten it in the front, I couldn‚Äôt wrap it in a way that didn‚Äôt flash anyone with a boob if I moved. I‚Äôm a 34B/AA so it‚Äôs just was bigger in the chest than I needed. But a safety pin worked great! I actually decided to keep it as a fun going out dress. It‚Äôs great! Definitely recommend."
4.0,"Nose area is a little dark, beard & lips are good."
4.0,Good for inside shoes. Material is ok.
4.0,Foldable sun glasses. Great for traveling. A bit loose on my small face
4.0,"I guess I'm the only one who likes these shorts.  I got an XL size for review and they fit me nicely.  I'm 5'9"", 148 lbs and have female birthing hips.  These shorts fit well and are comfortable.  I washed them in the dark laundry load and they came out of the dryer nice and soft and still fit.  I like them.  They seem to be very well constructed too."
4.0,I purchased large size since I am wearing 34D bra. It was super tight for me. I would go one size up if I would purchase this again.<br />It gives a full support for your back and front. I am satisfied overall.
4.0,"I love the print and the fit is good. Complements my figure very nicely. The sewing on the gathering around the waiste was not what I would have liked. But overall, the dress is perfect for a vacation dinner in Mexico."
4.0,"Typically wear a small or extra small and the size small I ordered fit well. Slightly oversized, comfortable, and cute."
4.0,"Great all-around comfort and style in long-sleeved tee, v-neck adds stylish flare. Tee shirt is a generous length for wearing untucked but fabric is lightweight enough to tuck in jeans or pants. Great deep gray, not too light or heathered."
4.0,"I love this hat, however I docked a star because it didn't come with any packaging material, so it arrived with two creases in it and the brim was bent up.."
4.0,This is probably operating on Asian sizes more than it is American.  Look to order larger than you are used to.  I like the feel and quality.
4.0,I bought these to wear under pants on very cold days and for that its ok except I have to pull them up a few times a day. They shouldnt be sold as legging but as pant liners for cold days or tight under skirts.
4.0,Love it. I wore it with a black dress to make it more trendy!
4.0,Are there any nice necklace. Very well made. Decent chunk of rose quartz. Been a collector of rocks and minerals and crystals I happen to really like this and it's very pretty thank you
4.0,"My boyfriend ordered this for me for our Cabo trip in 2 weeks, it got here early which is great but the Xl is way big around my waist and it‚Äôs longer than what I thought it would be. I‚Äôm 5ft 6 1/2 with a DD  bra size. It‚Äôs made very nice but the waist is way to big. We‚Äôre gonna see if we can get a medium or large quickly and return the XL"
4.0,"This dress was a nice color, but the fabric is very sheer."
4.0,"The shipping took longer than expected but the sweatshirt is great, colors are bright and awesome. My daughter loves it."
4.0,"Been looking for a pillow just like this! Easy to inflate with a vacuum, or an air pump.<br />Wish it comes with a pillow case as a noise suppressor, as it is a bit loud when you move it in bed. Would have been perfect height if one end is 2-3 inches higher to support my arm more comfortably."
4.0,my teen loves it & it fits perfectly except shorter than what can be worn to school (total bummer)
4.0,For the price this was amazing. Not see through. It is a little smaller than the ad said but overall fits and is flattering.
4.0,Nice..should buy it..
4.0,"This dress is much better quality than I expected with a $30 price.  Thick polyester material for the lining and the zipper seems very sturdy.  I really like it. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I ordered a petite size and it was not at all petite in length. I am 5 foot tall and the &#34;petite&#34; came down to my mid calf.  I'm used to hemming clothes, but was really hoping I wouldn't have to when ordering &#34;petite.&#34;"
4.0,I followed other reviewers and bought a size bigger than I thought I needed and it fits great. 4 stars because the belt is only a fabric ribbon and not an actual belt. The material frays on the belt. Overall I love this dress and might buy it in other patterns.
4.0,very sharp glasses
4.0,This dress is so cute on! Only complaint is that it gets so wrinkled. Ironed it before work and when I sat down for a period of time it was wrinkled again. I did get a lot of compliments on it though!
4.0,The robe is comfortable and fairly thick.  It fits well and is comfortable and attractive. Shipping was very prompt and it is a great value.
4.0,"wish they were a tad larger, about a half inch.<br />The logo printed on it sloppy and going off the side, but not a big deal, wish there was no logo at all."
4.0,i like it and it does what i need it to do
4.0,Es un poco transparente
4.0,They are so darling. I did just notice the gold is starting to rub off. My daughter is crawling.
4.0,"nice, but keeps flipping over. very nice necklace"
4.0,It is a nice tie.
4.0,It is very warm and perfect for the cold weather. You need to buy one size up as the fit around the feet is too snug. Doesn't go in easily
4.0,"Perfect size hoops! I haven‚Äôt worn hoops in so long. I have only worn them once, but didn‚Äôt bother my ears. Not sure how long they will last, but I do like them very much"
4.0,"Soft ,light and sexy good idea for sleep paint"
4.0,"It's a really nice piece, and goes with alot of the other things I wear. The only thing I don't like is that it's started to turn my wrist green in certain places."
4.0,I loved this necklace! The necklace was indeed dainty and elegant. The layered look is perfect for so many different occasions and looks great on! This necklace was an amazing Christmas present. The chain itself was thin but sturdy. This product is great for everyday or occasional wear. One downside is that the necklace tarnishes after a while of usage.
4.0,I liked the band but it is Not metal actually but no body can notice that when you are wearing the watch. Light in weight
4.0,It was thinner than I expected.
4.0,Fits nicely. Connectors seem strong. Not sure how durable the actual silicon is...worried it could tear.
4.0,Gave these as a gift and the recipient immediately put them on and said she loved them. I may just buy a pair for myself too! Appears to be good quality.
4.0,Soft! I have super sensitive skin and these pants are really comfortable. I took off one star because the elastic waist can get twisted a bit.
4.0,"It smells horrid for some reason so I'll need to wash it but I tried it on and it fit perfect.  I'm six feet tall so the legs may be long on you if you're on the short side. Another important thing you should know is ~ hand wash only in cold water.  You can't put this in a washer or dryer...so for those of you looking to save time, this wouldn't be for you. :)"
4.0,"Really loved this dress. It fit nicely, glad I got a small. Zipping the zipper was a little tricky but overall I am thrilled for the price. Love the pockets!!"
4.0,I love the fabric and design.  The only thing is the waistline. I expected it to be higher.  I‚Äôm going to take it to me seamstress to have it altered. It will be perfect for my Red Hat Cruise.  üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüé©üö¢
4.0,I have larger wrists and this fits great. I wish they weren't two separate pieces though. Love the rainbow/purple color
4.0,"Pretty necklace. Deicate yet not cheap or flimsy . Doesnt bother me neck like most jewelry does to me neck, csnt even feel it when it's on"
4.0,"This is a very fun product! I ordered it for Halloween and it got lots of compliments. It fits as expected, although the fur near the side of the face blocks my peripheral vision a little bit. It's very cozy. I like the cell phone pocket although my phone is too big to fit in it. All together I'm happy with my fox spirit hood."
4.0,"This was for my fianc√© and he found the fit to be perfect. The fabric and braid is of a good costume quality and the delta looks good (not perfect but good). He found it to be a bit itchy and wore a long sleeve shirt underneath, an irony given the mock neck. However, he didn't find it hot or anything and was quite pleased with it overall."
4.0,"These are an excellent concept. They fit well and stretch to grow with my 97th percentile baby boy. Unfortunately, the fabric is very thin. I can see the tag and diaper through them. And crawling around, the pale blue color shows dirt rather quickly."
4.0,"Fits very nicely. I had to go one size up but if you like the corset look, get your regular size. The built in panel makes this dress great for one size below, regular and one size bigger. can't go wrong here!"
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô2 and 180. I ordered a Large. It fit al up until it got to my thighs. I have very thick thighs and the material was not stretchy at all to get past them. I would say order up a size. Very cute, color is a little different in person but nonetheless cute outfits"
4.0,For what is pictured it is nothing like it. It is like the diet type of what the shirt should be. I still wear it it just doesn't look like the pic.
4.0,As expected. Knuckle rings. Except one which filling is a sticky white paste.
4.0,Great sweats
4.0,It‚Äôs good but I think it‚Äôs meant for a belt chain
4.0,Beautiful but it was too big so i returned it<br />It is also a heavy sweater
4.0,Bought for my mother-in-law..... it's nice but not great for over the shoulder. Had to figure out a way to lengthen straps more for her
4.0,The straps
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my Boyfriend. Looked nice, however the tie clip was a little short. Maybe better for a skinny tie. Just personal opinion."
4.0,These are very pretty. The reason I gave 4 stars is because they are smaller than I expected. I kept them because they are attractive.
4.0,"fits well. well sewn, looks good."
4.0,"I got these primarily for gardening work. They work great for that and are fairly good at keeping stickers and cactus spines (I live in southern Arizona) out of my hands. They are a bit hot, but then aren't all gloves?<br /><br />The fit is pretty good, a bit large on me, I'd say I would wear a medium in gloves so theses would work for medium/large, I imagine. The extra room is not that big of a problem for me and I can easily work with these gloves on. They are not too thick or too stiff.  Great to have additional pairs lying around."
4.0,I ordered the wrong size . But they are nice shorts. Thank you
4.0,"Cute hat that needed some add ons, and lots of fluffing."
4.0,These were a gift so I hope they hold up
4.0,"I loooove these socks. I have not yet washed them, so I don't know how that will go. The socks aren't super thick but they aren't thin and are nowhere close to as thin as tights. Color and quality is good. Not giving five stars because they could be better quality. Wonderful quality for the price though."
4.0,"I like it but it is a gift for my wife, so I will know after Christmas"
4.0,"The actual product was larger than I thought. I pictured a dainty piece, but it was hefty and substantial. So instead of wearing it as a choker, which would look good on a man, I made the cord as long as possible and wore it on top of a t-shirt.  Looks good!"
4.0,"It would be wonderful to have a pair that is not tinted.  Reds pop, colors are vibrant.  Give it 4 out of 5 stars because I want to wear them ALL the time."
4.0,I give them a 3.5 star rating. They work! It really makes the ball pop in the rough. It helps if it is sunny out when you use them. Hard to see if the grass is really long and the ball settles down. Also it doesn't work very good in the woods (I'm in there a lot). They are worth it though. Found my ball and others and it made my pipe visible when I dropped it in the rough
4.0,Works as expected. If not twisted around leg it will pattern on most pants
4.0,Pleasantly surprised ... Very striking piece and great deal for the price
4.0,"It's Halloween everyday for me. This dress is very comfortable. I did buy one size up on purpose, it's true to size. Soft fabric, thin for warm days. Paired with spider socks (knee high) and gloves ( elbow) for a complete outfit."
4.0,They run big so I‚Äôd suggest you size down. Otherwise a quality shirt.
4.0,"The pants are very nice but run about a size smaller then normal. The leg part is fine, but the waist feels like a non-adjustable belt. Will be returning for s bigger size if possible."
4.0,"I ordered a medium, as that is what the chart indicated I should order.  I normally wear a medium.  However, this shirt does run small.  I should have ordered a large.  It is a very pretty shirt.  If you order, I recommend going a size up!  I will be returning mine."
4.0,"Great value for the money, but they do run just a pinch on the small side..definitely take your measurements and use those when selecting a size."
4.0,very nice quality and heavy..
4.0,They are. Very nice look real. Woud buy again
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, with a 34&#34; bust and a 26&#34; waist.  In size small, this dress fits me very well; but the skirt is pretty long, coming down below my knees.  It isn't so low that I'll have to trim it, but for anyone shorter than me, it probably will be.<br />As for quality, the cloth is light-weight and thin, good for Summer.  It's sown well, though the skirt is cut slightly unevenly.  For washing, I put it on a delicate, cold-water cycle, turned inside out and grouped with like colors; then gave it a little heat in the dryer, hung it up and smoothed out the wrinkles with my hands.  So far so good!"
4.0,"These are really comfortable. Unforenately, I thought the brown was too dark so I return them. I ended up ordering them in the mushroom color and they were perfect."
4.0,"I love these,  I would have purchased more had the price not gone up.lol"
4.0,I am 5‚Äô2 130lbs. I got the large. It fit really well it was just a bit long. I was able to just hold it up when I was walking and it was fine. My only complaint was the dress was so wrinkled I had to put it in my washer with the steam setting 3 times. Other than that it was perfect!
4.0,I love this. It‚Äôs so comfortable. I plan to buy a newer one. I bought a large and it‚Äôs a tad too loose. Otherwise I really like this one. Stops the jiggles and keep me tight.
4.0,For the price you can‚Äôt beat it. The quality is good and isn‚Äôt flimsy. I think it runs a little small.
4.0,"This is a long sleeved tee shirt with a few sweatshirt-style details.  Based on other reviews, I ordered up, but didn't need to order up quite so much.  I typically wear a women's large or junior XL, so I ordered a 2XL, but should have ordered an XL.  I am keeping it, though, still comfy and cute!"
4.0,Ease of wearability.
4.0,My niece adores this
4.0,They are comfortable enough for the price. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on these because I wear them outside to walk my dogs. They have held up well so far.
4.0,Nice material and I liked the different style of this dress.  I was surprised it actually runs a little big.  I'm between a medium and a large and ordered large to be safe.  Definitely could have gone with a medium in this.
4.0,"I like the wide brim of the hat and the nice hole for the ponytail. I was not wild about the color options - would have preferred something more earth-tone to wear hiking, but ended up with the orange. the orange is really bright so if you like a bright orange, this is the hat the for you! Also you can adjust the diameter to fit your head, but I found it still a bit of a loose fit. I know this will depend on individual size but I don't think my head is that small.<br /><br />the hat will fold up small so you can shove it in your backpack but be aware it will be a bit deformed for awhile after it's been folded up for some time.  I do like this hat, perhaps the color will fade some in the sun over time."
4.0,"Nice fabric, good fit. I'm pleased with it."
4.0,"This crossbody purse is cute and simple. I was able to fit my credit cards, iPhone, checkbook and keys in it. It's not a lot of room, but enough for the items you want at your fingertips."
4.0,"Fun underwear, more suited for sex play."
4.0,Wore it to a 1920's themed party. Much better quality than I expected. Elastic was a bit tight.
4.0,Four stars only because it's too big for me so I don't know how it will look on someone it fits. I'm 5foot 115lbs and it was too long and rather boxy.
4.0,my friend loves it
4.0,very good and cost effective! even bought another pair for my twins!
4.0,Could bracelet could be a little easier to open
4.0,"These are sturdy, heavy Grandma's doily lace, not what most people are thinking when they see lace mask. Heavy duty, very comfortable, perfect for a masquerade!"
4.0,The little side buttons broke off 6 months after purchase!  I‚Äôm disappointed that the design is not more durable.
4.0,"The material is extremely thin but at the price what would you expect.  I ordered a large and it it swimming around the waist but I did not want it to be too tight across my butt.  I am extremely curvy and I usually purchase me skirts size 8/10.  I like it and it does make a little noise when you walk but because the skirt is not as tight, The swishing is limited."
4.0,It‚Äôs a sweet casual dress for running around. Great for warm weather !  I always get compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"Not as bright and shiny as the picture online, but still cute."
4.0,I‚Äôm a thick girl & wanted to show off some of my curves. It‚Äôs a bit snug but it wasn‚Äôt like it was tearing at the seams. I love the color !
4.0,"My wife picked these glasses up for me at a discounted price in exchange for a review. I had been looking for good, solid aviator sunglasses and these appeared to be a good choice.<br /><br />I have to say that I really want to like these glasses. The only problem in my view is purely subjective in the fact of the sheer size of the lenses. These things are HUGE! Though the sheer size of the lenses was a bit of a turnoff for me personally, I did find that the lenses were dark, but not too dark, and very clear. It's difficult to get a good scope of the size of sunglass lenses from a photo, so I can give a pass on that. Now, let's get to the good stuff<br /><br />When I opened the box, I noticed that there was a case inside. Not a flimsy cloth case, but a solid, protective zippered case.<br /><br />I pulled out the sunglasses and noticed that they were lightweight, but seemed durable. They did not feel like they were going to fall apart.<br /><br />I looked further inside the case and saw some things that I don't normally see, but was very impressed with. First, I saw a cloth drawstring carrying case to put the sunglasses in. Double protection for your sunglasses. I saw that they included a cloth lens cleaning towel to keep your glasses clean. Lastly, included in the box is a neat little screwdriver tool that clips onto your key chain. The cylinder can be manipulated to use the Phillips and flat head attachments. I thought that this was a nice little bonus.<br /><br />All said, these appear to be good, durable glasses with a few handy extra accessories. The only issue for me was the sheer size of the lenses, but again, it's purely subjective. If you are the type of person who likes larger lens sunglasses, these may be a perfect fit."
4.0,They're ok for the cost
4.0,Justo del size esperado
4.0,Bought for a safari Halloween costume  perfect for what i wanted it for.  Loose belt though
4.0,The glasses are in good condition buy they're just a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,Surprisingly comfortable. Lined with a soft material. Felt like the waist was a tad to big but overall a good buy.
4.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend who always wears a size medium and these were too small. Good product but not true to size, they're too tight so he cannot wear them."
4.0,"Great for wearing around the house or running quick errands. It's tee shirt material so you'd expect to spend less than ten bucks but for a few dollars more it's fine. I got the black tropical print and it's a very cute pattern. I wear 12/14 and the XL fits perfectly. I don't know how long it will hold up or do in the wash, but again, at $15 it's not an investment :-)"
4.0,"These are always a little small. Ordered the L/XL since most brands have a 'one size fits all'. While the large is still on the smaller size, they are wearable for size 6-8."
4.0,Purchased for mother.
4.0,"This top is very colorful and pretty.  I was expecting the fabric to have less of a T-shirt feel, but still a good way to dress up jeans and feel classy."
4.0,I like it but right out of the box I unbuttoned the front button to try it on and one of the buttons came off.
4.0,"Overall Great product!<br /><br />Pros: Bluetooth has fantastic connectivity and range. Fit of the beanie is good and stays on. Good sound. Good looking too! Basically, it does exactly what I want it to do.<br /><br />Cons: padding between speaker and ear could be better. My ear gets sore after a few hours of use. there is your standard blue flashing light for the Bluetooth; it catches peoples attention quickly. (i.e. Not very discreet). easily fixed with some electrical tape over the light though."
4.0,Color is more light than the photo.
4.0,Soft cotton feel. Nice coverage. The seams are inside out on the front. Runs true to size.
4.0,"This mask has been performing well.  You definitely get the feeling  that your breathing air that has gone through some protective layers.  That is also were the one challenge I had with this mask.  Once you get used to it you barely notice, but when you first put this on you noticed the extra effort in breathing.  With the level of filtering it provides this makes senceI guess."
4.0,Like it for the price
4.0,"This t-shirt is exactly like the pictures, good quality, the fabric isn't thin, no seam issues.  It's trendy and fun.  My only minor complaint is it runs more crop top for a mid size body than I would prefer for my Mom bod."
4.0,"My daughter looks adorable in this shirt, and she loves it bc of Dora. A big minus is the amount of glitter that falls off of the shirt, glitter for days! im hoping that will change once i wash it.."
4.0,It was really pretty. My only complaint is that it got rusty after like 3 weeks and that had never happened to me with other belly rings.
4.0,"Thin material but it was what I needed & expected, so I liked it"
4.0,"This looks exactly like the photo. I'm always weary of overseas sizing, but this one was true to size. Great piece for the price!"
4.0,Got these for my bridesmaids for my beach wedding. They looked gorgeous how ever ran quite big. Great value for what we paid and they look stunning in the pics. One set broke instantly but the rest were great
4.0,Good looking shirt.  Easy to care for.
4.0,I ordered a small based on reviews. It is super cute but a little tighter then I like. I still worry it out and got many compliments but I day get a size bigger then you think. I am 5'3 and 124 lbs.
4.0,Fit very tightly and case is quite sturdy. Snap head band is great
4.0,"Everything was perfectly proportional on this dress except for the sleeves. They are too short and ride up my arms, which is annoying with the ruffled elastic. Luckily i tend to wear my sleeves up anyway, so it isnt a deal breaker for me. Otherwise, its comfortable, fits as expected, and the fabric is comfortable and breathable. Just keep an eye on those sleeves if you buy this dress."
4.0,"It fits but not with a lot of extra room and has not yet been washed, so we'll see. It is a bit wide at the neck. I used the size chart to decide. My last night gown ordered via Amazon, no longer available, was a small and fit me loosely so there is quite a lot of difference between the two."
4.0,"Love the colors!  Lots of compliments.  Only drawback, is that it lays on the ears, causing some discomfort when you‚Äôre wearing it for more than a couple of hours  i still wore it for 10 hrs.  Just kept moving it over a different part of my ears."
4.0,Very comfy.  Washes nice.  I enjoy wearing them around the house .  I own 3 now
4.0,"Wasn't suppose to come till may 18 but I got it a lot sooner it's so pretty, it it's exactly like the picture I got the light pink and white only thing I don't like the yellow stripe but what ever lol"
4.0,The fabric is thin... not for formal events but us really flattering
4.0,"It does run a bit small in the pants.  I am usually a L but after reading the reviews ,I decides to go up 2 sizes. I could have went up 1 size &been just fine but I have large breast and a big bhutt so I was still able to fit it. It was jus alil to long but since the ankle scrunches I just raised it up. Overall I looked really cute in it and the colors are poppin! Will get more!"
4.0,Nice tie. Nice color
4.0,Middle stones a bit sparse.  Still very happy with my purchase.
4.0,It was a little tight with adjustments ok. I  have bought from other buyers about the same same very good quality.
4.0,"Great sweater, but the khaki is not khaki, it's closer to rose."
4.0,Fit was just right.  I ended up retiring though bc it looked curtain-ish.
4.0,but beautiful blouse
4.0,"They are cozy warm and so cute.  I take an 8.5, sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 9 depending on the brand.  These run just slightly small.  I should have ordered up a size."
4.0,Cute but it doesn‚Äôt have to much space
4.0,Good quality wallet with good delivery.  Chain is subpar.
4.0,It was needed in a pinch  and I wasn‚Äôt willing to spend much. It held up for what was needed but it‚Äôs not very durable and wouldn‚Äôt last for multiple uses.
4.0,Fits as expected.  Cute with leggings!
4.0,"With everything going on, I have come to appreciate an item like plastic gloves like this product. The number of gloves is generous. I am using for a number of tasks, but mainly for food prep and I feel all the better for it. They fit my hand as needed and I can still work comfortably. I'm pleased with this product and will definitely think about purchasing for the future."
4.0,"I‚Äôd say overall this watch is great. I ordered it to wear at work. However, it seems the holes for fastening the watch are made for people with extremely small wrists.<br />It‚Äôll work though, price was great!"
4.0,I really like the earrings.  The only problem I had was that it arrived two days after the arrival period.  I was wondering if I would get it at all because everything I've ever ordered through Amazon has always arrived right before or during the arrival period that they claim but never after.
4.0,It's a Larry Bird classic!
4.0,I like the color and it is far largervthan expected.
4.0,"A cute floppy sun hat to go with a swim suit or to wear in the summer with a sun dress. I did kind of feel like it was on the ever so slightly too small side on my head, but not enough to bother me too much. The brim was nice and wide and had a good amount of floppiness. My daughters love to try on my hat!"
4.0,beautiful but a bit big for my tastes.  I would recommend
4.0,Looks just like picture. To much clear molding stuff for the teeth... had to shave the excess off the back and bottom of the grill...
4.0,Christmas gift arrived exactly two months later.  The good news is my daughter loves it.
4.0,"Comfy and cute!  Unfortunately for me being a curvy girl, the pockets stuck out on my hips.. Not very flattering. Nice material though."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but the sleeves are a weird length for me."
4.0,"I usually wear petite small (34D. W- 28&#34;. H- 4'11&#34;), and ordered a M for this dress in Black after reviewing previous feedback and the size chart. It fits well, interestingly perfect in length. It hits exactly at my ankle without wearing any heels. Which is great for me as I do not have to alter the length, but might be a factor to consider for regular height people. The dress overall fits great, almost exactly like the picture. The arms only falls a little loose since I sized up, but that can completely ignored. Also, the fabric is not see-through but light enough to be worn in summer."
4.0,I was very upset as to ow small these were but the seller agreed to give me a full refund
4.0,NOT FOR BIG CHESTED WOMEN. I always wore with a bralette under it because it slips down with dancing. I‚Äôm a 36 DD. Also pills after several washes
4.0,Is made of a little bit thinner material than I expected but pretty good product all in all
4.0,Adorable outfit for my daughter and it fits as expected.
4.0,"A tenacious clip, not fancy but does the job."
4.0,Bonitos si<br />PERO muy delgadas las correas
4.0,"Great for the price. I got this for a Gatsby party because it was going to be cold walking to and from. It's as large as it looks in the photo and it will keep you warm. It will also get fuzz everywhere, and it is all synthetic, so it doesn't breathe - you don't want to wear it or carry it around all night. For the price it was perfect."
4.0,Very comfortable on the foot bed and tops are soft as well. I wear the all of the time so I‚Äôm beginning to some separation of the material on the front of the shoe after a mint of solid wear!
4.0,"Long for a short person, but comfortable"
4.0,Nice dress can be worn to work or school ... everyday style... material is soft...fall or winter dress...
4.0,"I liked this cover up for my Fl trip. Its light,  comfortable and the length was just right. I also wore it to thr park with shorts and a tee for my family cookout. I was cool and comfortable all day. This was a good buy."
4.0,"I am typically  S-M size,  I ordered M-size but it's small for me. The length is good, the colors and fabric are great! It's stretchy.  It's comfortable to my skin. I like it so I ended up returning it and got the L- size. Overall it's a great product for workout!"
4.0,"Good for winter, very warm. Seems a little too tight at the top."
4.0,It‚Äôs okay but it‚Äôs difficult when cutting your own hair
4.0,For the price I kept it. Top fits good bottom too small. I ordered a large. Nice style.
4.0,"Works well, but difficult to button for FAT fingers..."
4.0,"Very comfortable to wear , even under jeans. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large of this item, and glad I did as the fit is very snug.  Wore this to a weekend long soccer tournament in 30 degree weather and was comfortable.  Happy with purchase."
4.0,Really like this suit. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the spining in the sides is a bit uncomfortable and the bottoms don't really look like the picture. They remind me of 80s high-cut legs bottoms which I don't care for. Would need to do some serious &#34;landscaping&#34; if you wanted to wear them. All in all though it is very cute.
4.0,Cute toy
4.0,Good for my needs. They stayed in place and look nice.
4.0,I bought these with the intention of using them for reading on the beach.  Although I have not had that opportunity yet I think they will be fine.  They seem sturdy and vision quality was good.  I would recommend this product.
4.0,Beautiful dress a small fits like a size 6 and I am a size 2-3 so it runs a little large
4.0,"Nice bag, but the zipper opening at the top is a little too narrow."
4.0,The zipper doesn't want to stay up. but it does fit a little snug.  I bought it with the intent on it fitting snug now and better later.  But it does really make me sweat a lot.
4.0,"Not quite what I expected but not bad. The sound euros great, but it's definitely able to be heard by a passerby. The biggest disappointment was that the actual audio box was too big to fit under a helmet. I really wanted to be able to use it snowboarding, but it's so big, it would cause injury if I hit that part of my head. Will just use it for running or walking the dog instead!"
4.0,"I am 5'8"" and 165 lbs and I ordered a large. The shirt fits perfectly, very flattering with the front knot detail"
4.0,"I'm not a fan of the wrap top - just a personal preference.<br /><br />Material was thin. I felt like I looked like a referee honestly. Not a cute look.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great price. I wish my post baby body was more flattering in it."
4.0,I love the products from this seller.  Great quality yet affordable
4.0,"Came packaged well and promptly; I like the look and the size, but I can't get them into my ears. :(  The curve of the post makes it impossible to get into any of my piercings, so that was a disappointment. I'll try again later, but I suspect I now have four pairs of hypo-allergenic earrings I can't use."
4.0,"This suit looks great! The quality is much better than anything you will find in your typical Halloween costume shop, if you are picking it for that purpose. If you are going to be doing any vigorous movements, or wearing on multiple occasions, I would strongly recommend making some minor reinforcements, particularly with the pants. Otherwise, it's ready to wear and a nice quality.<br /><br />The fit:<br />I chose my size based on the jacket measurements. I have a broad chest and shoulders, and chose the XXL. It's probably the best fitting vest and jacket I have owned. The pants, on the other hand, are ginormous; this was expected, however. Just a little hemming, and they're fine. With the included sash and the outfit as a whole, your belt won't be seen. It would be nice if you could size the pants and top differently.<br /><br />Quality:<br />The jacket and vest are very well made. The jabot is a bit stiff and needs to be played with to look just right, otherwise it looks like a bib. I wish it were a bit more lacey and flowy, as well as the cuffs. The velcro is barely hanging by a thread, yet is strong. With that said, they are still better than most costumes I see.<br /><br />The pants are better than I anticipated, but the weakest link in the set. The pants were big on me, and still managed to rip within 10 minutes. Test out your range of motion, and if it feels like they can rip, I would recommend reinforcing it. Check for any other loose hardware, and hem as needed (very easy!).<br /><br />The buttons on the vest are big and loose (I believe they are shank buttons) with no reinforcement on the back. If you are going to be using them a lot, I would considering adding a reinforcement button. I haven't had any problems so far.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this suit. I received so many compliments at the party I wore it at the entire night. The next one is going to be Masquerade themed, and I'm looking forward to it!"
4.0,"great for yoga, compliments a lot.<br />but splits in the seams, only a month after bought."
4.0,Light fast dry pants! Great for every day use.
4.0,"Great pants, well made but not a American 3x. More 2x"
4.0,"These shoes are just perfect! I'm glad I followed my intuition. I noticed that the beige one fits perfect, I usually wear 8.5 and that's the same size I chose for the beige... But the black one were somewhat small, had to return them and order size 9. Overall I love the shoes, they are comfortable, I like the height of the heels and they provide good arch support"
4.0,This outfit is so cute. My 3.5 yr old is about 38&#34; and 30 lbs. The pants length in the size 4T were just a little short so I rolled some cuffs at the bottom to be a capri length and it still looks super cute. Great outfit for the price. Would also look great witha cardigan in the fall. Oh and shipping was way faster than they projected. Received item in 9 days!
4.0,They can go over boots to remove. I really sweat inside. But it keeps rain off
4.0,The ring size was what I expected. It is a great accessory. The prongs stick out a bit and the stone feels a bit loose. Be aware of you are wearing a sweater or any fabric that might snag.
4.0,No complain about the product. So far so good. Looks durable. As good as the Apple original band
4.0,"This is cute and definitely can't be laced tightly, needs to be worn as the picture shows and I had a lot of trouble keeping the staps up even though I kept pulling the vest down"
4.0,Love the feel and it fits great. Fast delivery.
4.0,"Great looking, stylish watch. Can't beat the price."
4.0,"I was between a M and L on the sizing chart (I'm 5'5&#34; and around 150 lbs with a C/D cup) - I was planning on sizing up as suggested by other reviews, but the swallow pattern (multi-color black) that I wanted was only available in medium so I took a gamble and ordered it. I also ordered the navy floral pattern (navy_pink) in large as a back up. Both fit pretty similar in the waist. The two dresses actually have completely different fabric and hem line. The swallow dress is a softer more stretchy cloth/cotton feeling type fabric (it's not cotton but I'm not sure how to better describe it), and the hem is an even length around the whole dress and skims the top of my feet. The black floral dress is more polyester/faux-silk feeling and the front of the hem line is higher and hits right below the knee while the back is at my feet. It also has a separate navy blue under layer while the swallow dress is just one layer. The difference in sizing is in how much fabric is in the bust area. There is more coverage available with the large. Honestly even with the large I'm going to wear a lace bralette undeenesth. The dress style is pretty low cutting regardless of size. Because the swallow dress is a stretchier fabric, you can adjust it in place to cover almost the same about. Long story short, I love how they both fit in all areas but the bust so I'm planning on keeping both and just finding something to wear underneath the top since I want to up the modesty of the dress."
4.0,like the hat very much esp. with brim keeps my head warm
4.0,This too is super cute I sized up but was still smaller then expected. But very cute and not bad on the quality.
4.0,Color wears off easily
4.0,Like it but wish it was more enclosed on the sides.
4.0,Girlfriend liked it. She is pretty busty and it works well for her.
4.0,"I purchased this gift for my children's granny as a gift. Overall, the quality of the bracelet was great and it held up for quite a while, but the metal did began to oxidize after months of wear. Still a great product for the price!"
4.0,"I loved my first pair, and when I lost those, I just order another pair, no sweat. I had one of the glasses popped out once, I popped it back in, and it never came out again. Love them"
4.0,They fit nice and feel like they are of good quality. They outlast regular sweatshirts and are worth the money. My favorite. Thanks.
4.0,I‚Äôm a size 38D so this was definitely not comfortable for me especially since the fit was woman size and I felt like the round neck line had me in a major choke hold lol. The material and the quality are soft and lightweight. Texas weather and bigger bust definitely need a looser neck fit or V-neck. I‚Äôm so sad it was to snug but I saved it as a goal shirt. So for now the Roses stay in my closet.
4.0,"This is very cute and you can wear it whether your ears are pierced or not.  It pinches a little bit with extended wear, so it's less of a daily accessory than it is a going out thing.<br />Keep in mind: this perfectly fits my ears and I'm a young cis woman.  If you have bigger ears, this is not going to work for you.  You can adjust it some, but not massively."
4.0,"So, I'm on the fence with this sweater... I love the greyish seafoam color, the rolled edges on all the hems, and the fact it fits with plenty of room.<br />But... I was disappointed to discover the knit is more open weave than it looked. You will need a tank or something under it. I'm also not totally in love with the fabric texture. It's not scratchy, but its not fluffy and soft either, it's just basic. For the design, I think it should be super soft and cozy.<br />The one thing I really dislike is the placement of the arm/shoulder seams! I tried to get a pic so you can see how low they are. To me, the arm seam should be near the base of your shoulder/armpit area. The seam on this sweater is down to my elbow! Why?! It's still wearable, but I find this really weird.<br />Besides the weird sleeve seams, this sweater does fit which is a definite bonus. I have a large bust of 50"" and it's a gamble with online clothing. I got the 24W and it totally fits without being too tight or too short (I am 5'5""). I consider the fit oversized for me so that makes me happy. I also love the color and I think the lower 30 dollar range is fair for it.<br />Overall, the open knit, fabric texture, and weird sleeve seams are what puts me on the fence with this one. The color and fit are mostly good.<br />I think this is one of those items that is a little bit of a gamble, not a love at first sight sweater. It's not totally awful, it's just not my go-to sweater. Hope that helps :)"
4.0,"Perfect for leggings, especially at work."
4.0,Good deal if you have to replace a lot of batteries. I would have preferred resealable little individual packets. I would suggest a back replacement tool to make putting the watch together easier.
4.0,"These are comfortable, but a higher than what I expected. I am 5'3"", so not high wasted, I suppose. These come just under my bust line."
4.0,ME GUSTAN MUCHO
4.0,Masks fit good and filter can be placed in them. Wouldn‚Äôt mind material being a bit thicker.
4.0,Like the bracelet but the elastic in beads pinches - bit tight.
4.0,Didn't have the size we needed so had to get the next size up. I'm sure it doesn't matter too much since it was a gift.
4.0,"I used the pink and black one for a dance competition. The color is exactly like you see on the computer. It was nice and fluffy, and it had very minimal shedding for a boa. Very pleased."
4.0,Nice shades!!!!  I love em :) :) I would recommend them to anyone! Awesome awesome just wished they were bigger
4.0,"This watch is made well and keeps time accurately enough to be reliable. It is a very good looking watch, made for dress up but can be worn as an every day watch. It would have been better if they had made luminous hands on the dial and markers for night use. It is a pretty good watch for the money."
4.0,If u are a plus size its not for u its short in lenght but still really nice
4.0,Keep your nose warm in the freezing cold.
4.0,"Super cute purse, fringes are great because there are a lot of them, but not too much and the size is just right, not too big and not small.  The fabric itself is a bit stiff and not sure how long it will last, but as I said, it's super cute."
4.0,Standard Under Armor - starts to show wear a bit at the end of a few games...
4.0,"The straps does look pretty, but it‚Äôs hard to<br />put on. The sparkles give it a fancy look. I found out the material also makes it irritating to wear."
4.0,"Ropa interior comoda y suave, pero el color de la tela se va a las pocas lavadas"
4.0,"I like the size of the purse, wish the opening was bigger, but overall it is a great little purse."
4.0,"This is a nice and sturdy bag. Not sure I would buy again. I a little thrown off by the flap inside, the Velcro is much longer then the piece it connects too. I will still use though."
4.0,stains with constant use.
4.0,Very nice cookouts but shorter than normal
4.0,"cute shoes, great price, a bit too narrow for my size 6 daughter"
4.0,Elegant ‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but sizing was off."
4.0,Great reflection lenses. The frame is ok
4.0,I really love these but the lettering was not completely filled in a little disappointed by that but nothing major was wrong. Small sizes the 7 fit me but the 10 was to small for my boyfriend.
4.0,I have a big face but nice glasses
4.0,"The fit was slightly bigger than expected, but it works still. I do not like the shorts with it, so I use a pair from a different suit."
4.0,"Somewhat large, but I haven‚Äôt tried to wash it yet.  I still like it."
4.0,"I like the band, but one of the pins was missing. Other than that, nice band. I like to change my watches so it is nice I can change the band."
4.0,"My kids loved these. They love playing dress up! The material is okay. The capes are not sewn super well, but I sew, so I reinforced the seams."
4.0,"I love love this tote, it's the perfect size and I can fit so much in it. What I enjoy most about this bag is that the quality leather is strong & light at the same time so as us women tend to fill up our purses this tote doesn't become too heavy to carry. Wish it came in more colors though, I have the gold one too."
4.0,"Very nice soft material! I ordered for my husband and  sized up as it looked to run small and its still a little too snug. Super comfortable though so I'll probably keep for myself and just wear around the house. I would buy again, just make sure to size up one or two sizes!!<br />(Measurements are my husband's) I ordered an Xl for him and fits me better- 5'2""- 155 lbs or so"
4.0,Beautiful stone! Like other reviewers mentioned the holes for the chain are small & hard to find a chain that will fit through with clasps. In order to get the chain I had for it to work I had to break some of the chain claps & modify how it closes. I also had to open one of the holes on top of the gen. I have already received several comments on how pretty the necklace is though!
4.0,"This is a nice pair of fun earring studs which can give the illusion of multiple piercings or dress up an outfit with a light bit of accessorizing. When opening the box with the pair of earrings, I did notice that they were a bit smaller than I'd expected. I had read another review stating the set was small, but didn't think it would be quite this small.<br /><br />There were no measurements that I could locate at the time of my order so after receiving this set I took my own measurements. I purchased the Blue Opal style and the center Blue Opal is about 0.5 mm in size. The two smaller clear Cubic Zirconia stones are around 0.3 mm each in size. The full angled length is a span of about 1.5 mm for the earring itself. So they're not very prominent if one is looking for a larger earring set to wear. For those with multiple ear piercings, like myself, it allows for wear higher up on the earlobe. If an individual only has one ear piercing, it will give the illusion of multiple piercings but is small as a decorative piece of jewelry.<br /><br />This set appears nicely made and does sparkle, but it is a bit on the small side. It rests better for me in my upper ear piercing space due to the petite size of the stones and design. I do like the interesting earring piece, but if one is looking for a larger stud set that stands out a bit more prominently on the earlobes, you may want to look at additional options before deciding on this set. Though because they are small, they would make a nice set of young girl's earrings. Plus the price point isn't too much on the high end in case they get lost, so it makes for an inexpensive gift with a bit of flare."
4.0,"This is a very pretty blouse at a great price. I  am 5'4&#34; and 135, and I got a size 6, my normal size. I like to tuck it in in the front. It's low but not too low and I am not very big."
4.0,"We're everyday to work,but clasp gets a little off."
4.0,"It was really awesome and came in super quickly! Very accurate and well made, I use it when I go to swim practice as well cause the inside is mesh so if it gets wet it dries really quickly! I gave it 4 stars cause I would‚Äôve preferred pockets but over all was very comfy the appliqu√©s are very strong and won‚Äôt fall off I got a medium and it was a little tighter in the arms than I wanted but it still fit very nicely"
4.0,Wonderful customer service. I ordered a large. Usually I'm a M/L in tops and 36C bra. And it fit like a small. They ended up emailing me first to see how the fit and dimensions were and I told them it was too tight so they sent me an XL at no cost. The XL is a tad bit loose on me but can still be worn. I almost wonder if they didn't send me the right size the first time bc it was so small. Other than that it's good quality material and good customer service.
4.0,I am happy with the earrings. I think my granddaughter will love them.
4.0,"Runs small.  I'm usually a small and I ordered a large based on other reviews.  The bra part fits, but the shoulder straps are a bit long.  Good for the gym overall though"
4.0,Staticky but cute fit!
4.0,"Pretty comfortable with one exception, it will pull arm hair if you‚Äôre not careful with the magnet."
4.0,I really like these. Only downside is they can be a little stiff when first trying to get the back off. One of mine also came missing a jewel. Other than that I am happy with my purchase. I have fairly sensitive ears but can wear these for a couple weeks straight with no problem. Would give five stars if all products arrived intact
4.0,"They appear to help with moisture and sweat in my work shoes so I am good. Wish they came a little longer but they are thin, which is what I needed for my shoes. It's hard to find thinner fabric."
4.0,Sizes  are wrong.  I ordered the large which are listed as 36-38.  When they arrived they were labeled 38-40 on both  the waistband and the package so I almost returned them.  I tried them on and they are actually 34-36 which is fine because I wear 34.
4.0,Very nice.  Great size. cleans very good.
4.0,Fits perfectly to your size and is more comfortable being an inch and a half instead of two inches. Looks very nice but the buckle is attached to the the belt with two screws like a rifle sling instead of the normal snaps.
4.0,Fits like it's supposed to and is comfy.
4.0,So it fits a little snugly. I wish I could have gotten a 3xl. But the fabric is really soft and cozy.  It buttons up nicely. And I love that it has pockets!
4.0,Love the color and the fit is perfect for my tall frame...highly recommend
4.0,Nice green color. Comfortable.  Pretty lace detail.  Will take in the waist a little to give it better shape. O.k. for the price.
4.0,this dress is extremely form fitting i chose a medium i am 5'7&#34; 150lbs and a 36B chest with a 42 width for my hips. Since the material is so stretchy  the color fades i chose the black dress (it look more like a really dark navy blue) and it turned slightly gray on my chest and butt area I should have ordered a large but it still fits nicely.
4.0,Beware all the fuzzies that come off of this but otherwise a very cozy robe
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, however, tends to run small so it‚Äôs smart to buy a bigger size to help compensate the size difference."
4.0,Lots of room for cards/I'd.
4.0,Great! Worked for a wedding I went to. It was a bit tight/ see through. But did the trick in a pinch. FYI this wedding was a step below black tie.
4.0,Ring seems ok other than I don't like it on my daughter.
4.0,"nice, elegant looking, sparkly..i thought they were dangle type....the kind that move.... but .they dont move.  they are still nice...<br />i would prefer if they were the dangle type though...they are definitely worth the price"
4.0,"This is a great suit.  I wear a size 8-10 and ordered a 2XL.  I'm 5'8&#34; 150 pounds.  This suit covers without being too modest.  My 12 year old daughter said its a bikini but not.  I love it!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is one of the buttons was lose on receipt, but I can fix that."
4.0,Super cute!! Love it! The shirt is a bit on the small side. Pants were exact for. Would have given it 5 stars if the shirt was a tab bit bigger.
4.0,Like having an assortment of colors. Fit fine.
4.0,"overall its a good mold , it has chemical smell so u need to soak and wash it ,, then for me need to cut eyes out bigger to see better ,, i took wig part off so to add my own ...good from far away look ..happy w purchase"
4.0,I had to buy this pullover as part of a casual uniform to wear over a polo. It's supposed to be navy but is too light compared to the navy polo. It is very comfortable but I wish it was thicker - it does nothing to keep me warm.
4.0,"It is very pretty once it comes, but I wouldn't wear it every day. The charm broke off after a while. Its nice to get as a novelty rather than actual jewelry."
4.0,"It's ok, but the guy I gave it to has a really big head."
4.0,I put it on and busted out the elastic on the back. I'm only a 34C and not that thick around the top! My mom is currently tacking the elastic back in
4.0,"These are the cutest vans ever! My daughter absolutely loves them, and so do I. These are great for back to school, and as always with Vans seem very sturdy and well made. At $33 not a bad price either."
4.0,I think these are made in China due to the tiny build of the size. Normally a large ordered a 2x and so glad I did!
4.0,The beads are way bigger than expectef
4.0,way smaller than i imagined but still cute
4.0,I received all 20 pieces (10 silver &amp; 10 gold). Not all fit well and a few aren't my taste but there's definitely a few that aren't my taste but they make cute give always to friends. My favs are already starting to turn. Eh! So I may have to buy a few more. Yay!
4.0,"...unfortunately, the clasp is cheap and will need to be replaced after only a handful of wearings. Easily enough resolved, and worth it! I get compliments every time I wear this necklace. It absolutely goes with everything and I'd buy it again or feel very confident in giving it as a gift!"
4.0,"It's nice, my only complaint if that the clasp is small and difficult to put on by myself. Otherwise I like it."
4.0,Really pretty nice
4.0,Super cute....but thin flimsy fabric.
4.0,"I bought this top in two colors (one jade and one what was supposed to be tomatoered) the following is my assesment of this top.<br /><br />MATERIEL<br /><br />It is SUPER thin. Which for me is great because I live in the Dominican Republic and I am not particularly picky about showing my bra under a shirt (as long as its black it looks nice). However, know that the top is really seethrough and if you do mind showing your bra you will have to put a tank top underneath it.<br /><br />FIT<br /><br />I do find this top to be incredibly flattering for my figure. I am big chested so I love that it accentuates my breast area and falls nicely (loose) around the stomach area so it doesnt show any lovehandles, which I really appreaciate. I also find the length is perfect. (I am 5'2'' and the front falls just below my stomach and the back about mid booty)<br /><br />COLOR<br /><br />Here is really my only complaint as I didnt receive the color I ordered. The jade came exactly as it is shown in the picture however, I believe that instead of tomatoe red they sent me neon orange. I did not bother to send it back as I really liked the orange but the fact that it was the wrong color wasnt great.<br /><br />All in all this is a great summer shirt and its just the perfect middle of classy and casual."
4.0,It tarnished fast
4.0,They are a little tight to open.
4.0,"5'9&#34;, 34A, 135 lbs. The length goes to about an inch above my knee as you can see in the photo. This dress is not see-through. I walked in the sunlight to make sure. It is made from t-shirt like material as others have described. I have included a photo of the washing instructions (do not dry this in the dryer!!). It does have small white spots throughout the entirety of the dress, but this does not really take away from the look and it is barely noticeable (photo included). The elastic part is comfortable and does not pinch or irritate like other tops sometimes do. It has pockets, but the pockets are not big enough to hold your cell phone. Your cell phone will stick out a bit.<br />For the price, I would buy this product again. It's an everyday comfy dress."
4.0,"Looks great, super cute! My 4 year old loves it. She wore it for Christmas and for a birthday party. The only downside is I have had to order this twice because she broke the necklace. Expected for a 4 year old I suppose."
4.0,Good gift item
4.0,Love the portability. Good to have in a pinch!
4.0,Beautiful fabric. The cut was not as I expected with the legs rather high-cut for briefs.  Still comfortable and wearable.
4.0,I still ware them but to be honest you need long socks or they will rub on the back of your calf area.
4.0,"Cute suspenders, no problems there! The tie is cute but does not stay in place very well. I would much rather have a clip on tie and may end up gluing a clip to it and nixing the strap that goes around the neck."
4.0,This is a nice pair but I just wished I paid less for this. :-(  Will still wear them of course.
4.0,üôåüèæüôåüèæ
4.0,"Love the style and price, but they are a bit snug - even for my narrow face"
4.0,"Good all around bag, a quick rub with beeswax and it was water resistant. I have a few months of daily use in it as a tool bag so far no issue at all. Pretty comfortable but not as much as a expensive bag it was a little stiff unil the last few weeks, its a bit more plyabl now."
4.0,"A bit uncomfortable, but after a little modification with some glue and sponge it was great. Was a bit harsh on the bridge of your nose."
4.0,Working great so far. The normal key rings are usually deformed by now. Wear these at work in an industrial setting and they are holding up great. I just wish they were bigger in diameter.
4.0,"I tend to like a full coverage panty, but these were kinda granny-panty ish even for me. Perhaps I needed a medium, I don't know. I bought the neutral package and have a few notes. The white panty is entirely see through if this is a big deal to you please know. The beige/skin tone panty was very yellow in its hue. If you have pink/red undertones to your skin this is not a good one for you. If you have yellow tones then its a WIN!"
4.0,looks good but a little big
4.0,These are a nice size with great color quality. I can wear them with a lot of different outfits.
4.0,"Not expensive, but a nice touch !"
4.0,Clothers were small than I expected and not as good as polishing clothes I have had in the past. But ok.
4.0,The body suit fit as expected. Would have loved to have better lining on the inside but overall the quality was decent.
4.0,I love it but it keeps getting caught in my hair.
4.0,"good looking watch, I seriously thought it was a G-Shock, that's why I bought it. but it's not and it's a great looking watch. catches a lot of attention."
4.0,Nice looking . Too short. Never got to wear
4.0,"I wore this ponchos couple times, it was really good.<br />suitable for:<br />Parks, rainy days, horseback riding, water sports, outdoor parties, matches, camping"
4.0,Good quality.  A little short on arms.
4.0,"The crotch rise is a tad too short, but they fit as expected, the plush is great, and hey, it's Hello Kitty!"
4.0,IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT. ONLY THING IS IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT.
4.0,"This is very beautiful!!!!  Fits nicely, just a tad bit small, and I don'[t like the g-string with it, but with some nice lace panties it is CUTE!!!!"
4.0,"Cute. The material is light, there is a sheer panel at the back which is cute too."
4.0,"Very nice, soft, and flowy fabric. It feels wonderful against the skin. I LOVE pockets on dresses, and the color is beautiful (got the red, and it's exactly as shown). It's supposed to be flowy, but the cut looks a little too much like I'm drowning in a potato sack. But throw on a belt, and it's perfect."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured, in no way too small, it's adjustable AND elastic!"
4.0,"Not too thrilled with the way it came - in a mesh bag, all loose, but they're still cool bracelets. It was a gift and the recipient hasn't complained :)"
4.0,I love them for the price and they are so cute and pretty in person
4.0,"This is nice, I like messenger bags and like that this one isn't very large. I can fit just what I need in it."
4.0,"I bought this shirt as a gift for my daughter's 13 year old friend.  Her friend is a medium to large.  When the shirt came in, I can see it is sturdy and good quality.  No loose threads, no cheap dyes.  But the shirt was on the smaller side.  It actually fit my daughter, who is an extra small to small size.  I suppose it would have fit a medium size person, but it would have been really tight, especially in the chest area.  It would be uncomfortably tight.  I advise if you buy this shirt, which would be a great buy, you'll need to go up a size or two if you want the shirt to be slightly fitted."
4.0,A little on the thin side
4.0,Good and warm I like the material used. Used as snow pants or snowboarding pants worked very well
4.0,A little snug for my head.
4.0,Looks really cute ..!
4.0,Nice material I love the way it looks. But it is small. Order one size larger. Too tight on my top.
4.0,Like the glasses. Like the color of lens but they do not completely cover my glasses but that was my error. Will keep for a spare.
4.0,"Works well for walking from the pool to the dressing rooms, or after you dry off with a towel from the shower. But if you're wanting something that absorbs, look elsewhere."
4.0,"Overall these compression socks are really nice. I got the L/XL and wear a size 10 shoe. The fabric is thick, soft and not at all scratchy. I love the hot pink/red color combo. It's so colorful and would look great worn with a skirt. Unfortunately, I can not wear them. I have larger calves (20inch) and could barely get these up over them. They were too tight to be comfortable to wear for me<br /><br />I deleted a star for not being wide enough to be useable. If you have normal size calves, then these are fun and fashionable compression socks. If you are plus size or have wide calves, you will need to look elsewhere sadly."
4.0,this is a very hard to find item.it is  perfect for hooking to a purse or tote bag. great price
4.0,The necklaces I received are very adorable and look and function just as they do in the picture.
4.0,Absolutely love this bag......only drawback was that it's smaller than I anticipated. Otherwise loving it.....also color us slightly different from picture seen but I love love love it.
4.0,"Areke Women's Grooved Cuff Bracelets,Stainless Steel Brushed Edges Hair Tie Bracelet Bangle For Girls Men Color Gold+Rose Gold+Silver<br />I am on the fence as to if this is a 4 or a 5 star product.<br />These are sturdy, the colors are pretty much as shown and they came with some hair ties that I didn't know were coming, so bonus. Anyway, these are too big for my wrist, so I used my massive muscles and squeezed one closed slightly. Now it is hard to get on, but still feels like it could fall off. So I opened it back up slightly and I think we will just have to trust it won't fall off. :) I actually didn't think, when I ordered these, that these were for hair ties. I just thought they were cool looking. I almost always have a hair elastic on my wrist and my best friend usually has 2! I am giving her one of these for sure!<br />The only other thing that bugs me is that when I do close these down slightly, the edges of the opening are a bit rough on my wrist. I wish the edges were just a bit more polished. Otherwise, these are great!<br />I am the busy mom of a nearly 5 year old boy. We live at the beach and keep active. We spend a lot of time outdoors and in the water. We own two small businesses as well.<br /> I am happy to answer any questions you might have.<br />5 stars ‚Äì I love this and recommend it<br />4 stars ‚Äì Pretty good, but could be better for one reason or another 3 stars ‚Äì I don‚Äôt hate it, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again<br />2 stars ‚Äì Several issues and if I had to pay for it, I would send it back<br />1 star ‚Äì I do NOT like this product. I would not recommend this to anyone"
4.0,"My favorite part of this dress is the fabric. I chose the floral mustard. Both the colors and chiffon-like material are beautiful. The dress too, overall is beautiful! It can transition from work to evening. It really looks and fits like the advertised photo. Though the dress fits me ok, if you have a pretty large bust, be careful. The top portion to waist runs smaller than normal. It zips on the side with a nice lining and there is no give. One could have issue with front buttons. I am about 5‚Äô8‚Äù,145 lbs, only a 34B, and waist 28. I purchased M. It fits, but 5lbs more, it may sit on a hanger. Hardly ever do I encounter chest being small. I will wear sports bra. It feels like a size small in that area only. However,  I have exceptionally long legs and pretty long arms.  Dress length and sleeves are perfect. I really like!  I‚Äôd like mustard shoes! :)"
4.0,"My son-in-law loves the all-around print design.  He's a big guy, and the asian sizing made it a little tricky, so it was a bit snug, but he loves it!"
4.0,"Loved the colors , easy to tie and came out nicely. Got lots of compliments my neck is a 15 1/2 and fit nicely. A few strands where sticking out and a extra piece of material came out in the packaging that did t belong anywhere . Cut the strands and came out good."
4.0,I am a 34 B and my bras fit snugly in this case. I wouldn't recommend it for anything bigger. It works perfectly for travel and I didn't have to worry about anything getting smushed along the way. I liked that it had an extra pouch to sore other items and the print is very pretty. I will definitely use this whenever I travel.
4.0,This is my third pair in 5 years.  I love the fit and they are waterproof.  I wear them all day to work in and they keep my feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  After a year off constant wear they develop a leak in the soul that lets in water.  I still wear them for dry days and get a new pair for the wet ones.  If not for this problem I would give them a perfect rating.  The price is low enough to keep getting a new pair every year.
4.0,Great novelty item.  Worked well under a suit jacket.  They are a little stiff so they come off the chest a little sometimes.  The light mechanism is on the back where the two straps meet creating a small bulge if you are wearing a jacket... but nothing to noticable
4.0,"Looks great, but string is too short for adult."
4.0,"a little tight , but have good quality"
4.0,Great product for the price.  Exactly what I wanted and fits a lot of stuff.
4.0,"it's a really cute shirt, but by the seams threads were starting to come out. but all together i love it!"
4.0,"Very cute dress. The sizing is small. I'm 5'4&#34; and 150lbs, normally wear a size 8/10. I ordered a 12 and it fits well. I prefer wearing the V neck as the front. Cute pattern, nice feeling, almost silky, fabric (a bit thin). I put it in a lingerie bag in the washer and line dried and it held up fine, minimal wrinkles."
4.0,The suit is nice but it went up too high on me at the collar.  Had to return it.
4.0,They‚Äôre a bit bigger than I expected but that can be a good thing.  I didn‚Äôt realize we‚Äôd have to match the designs together ourselves but w/all the different color styles you can find a pair that will go with anything!
4.0,I really like the dress! Just arrived today. So i haven't worn it out if the house yet. Plan on wearing it to a friends wedding. Its light weight and cozy. I'm 5'2 189lbs. I bought 2xl. I normally wear 14.
4.0,"it's really warm, not for all year-round usage, but very comfy otherwise. Good pockets, feet a little too large, generally a very nice product."
4.0,"These are very warm and comfy slippers. I love them, but when I saw them they looked more pink than purple. I emailed the seller and asked him if they were, in fact, purple. After a couple weeks, he never responded so I ordered the anyway. They are pink and burgundy, NOT purple. With that said, they are still awesome slippers, I just really wanted purple."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but a bit too large.."
4.0,"I love this wallet, but the chain hangs weird! the belt loop didn't last the snap let go"
4.0,"Super cute , exactly as pictured but thin and definitely womens size."
4.0,Very nice..cool.
4.0,"Worked as advertised for me, but might be better if it covered two fingers. It depends on how you write or draw."
4.0,"Love the style...but I wish it had two things: an insulated compartment for bottles, and a zipper that closed all the way - I keep losing stuff when I put the bag in the bottom of the stroller. The straps are pretty stiff as well and dig into my shoulder. But it‚Äôs a super nice looking bag...I feel good carrying it around."
4.0,These are great and better quality then expected for price paid! We have received compliments on them and my husband couldn‚Äôt be happier
4.0,"nice shoe, bit small"
4.0,"The dress is really pretty, lace all through. It is an usual size like other dresses. I love the back particularly."
4.0,"This dress is actually really nice. I wanted to wear it but if you are big chest wise, there isn't enough fabric to cover a bra. I tried a strapless one but it was peeking out on the sides."
4.0,"These were as good as advertised. They look and feel great. The glasses do feel a bit fragile, I can see them breaking with a minor incident. But for the price point it‚Äôs expected. Great buy overall."
4.0,I like it oversized. I use it for a workout shirt. It fits a lot tighter than my other Caltop 4x shirts.
4.0,They did turn out to be a bit big but my kids will grow into them. Their feet have been so warm and there has been no complaints about scratchy feelings.
4.0,My husband loves his watch. He wished it had a different type of clip but other than that he loves it
4.0,Need a longer chain
4.0,Be wearing this dress to my grand niece wedding.
4.0,Beautifully made and unique Apple Watch band. This band has held up well and gets lots of compliments on its unique double wrap style. My only complaint is the strap is a bit long and when I tighten it appropriately the end of the strap hangs out over the watch
4.0,"MINI SKIRT!!!  This is for crazy short people, not people that are 5'10&#34;"
4.0,"This is a cute shirt. I ordered my normal size small and it ran more like a medium. Kinda long, but it will be perfect to wear with leggings."
4.0,"Earrings are much smaller than I expected and appear to be round, not oval as pictured."
4.0,Wide enough not to bind the side of my head. Very comfortable.
4.0,if you have small writs like i do it wont fit you but its a good sturdy product i will keep it as a back up but i have small skinny writs wont fit but ill give it a 4 out of 5
4.0,"The compression socks are a bit easier to get on than other compression socks, but my father<br />still needed help to get them on his legs."
4.0,"They cloud up too fast, the glass is plastic so they get funky. But for smashing around they are great. 3rd pair"
4.0,I ordered this belt for my boyfriend. It's one size and you cut the end to adjust it to the fit you prefer. It seems to be pretty decent quality and he's been getting every day use out of so I'd say it was a good purchase.
4.0,"I bought this pendant as a gift and have not even opened it.  Perhaps they should wait at least a couple of weeks before wanting a review.  However, I can see through the packaging that it is a very nice pendant and should make my grand daughter very happy."
4.0,"I ordered the extra large based on the sizes, and I'm glad I did!  I normally wear a size 4, so I'm not sure what someone else would do size wise, but I do love the suit, and it's great for the price."
4.0,I really liked this. It is a little big on the bottom but if you have large boobs you might want to go ahead and stay with your regular size or the girls will be popping out the sides.  It is very cute though. It is for a vacation in Barbados so I think it will be perfect for dinner.
4.0,Nice for the $$.  Arrived quickly and was true to description.  I would purchase more of these for others I know. You can't go wrong.
4.0,Came quickly and it was beautiful done. The price was great too.
4.0,"This is very comfortable. I am 5'4 about 165, I ordered a large and for me I should've gotten a xlarge. I normally wear a large. But besides that I do recommend this item."
4.0,"Consolidates and organizes space, as expected.<br />Various sized things are not slipping out.<br />I would say this would be the minimal size for organizing a bunch of miscellaneous things.<br />Good buy."
4.0,love the color  and the flow...flattering
4.0,"I wear a 4 in all jeans and bottoms but had to get these in an 8 for a perfect fit. They are very nice/sexy jeans but I wish the flare was even wider. I'm looking for really slim fit jeans in top that break at the knee into a bell flare that cover my entire shoe. Also at 5'6&#34; tall these weren't quite long enough for flare jeans :-( I felt I needed at least another inch on the inseam but for $50, great jeans overall!"
4.0,"I like it. It's a bright true red definitely makes a statement. I'm not in love with it. The Sherpa collar is a little cheap looking but overall I like it, it's not heavy but it's a great fall jacket on those brisk mornings or chilly evenings out."
4.0,This shirt is the bee's knees. It fit a little loose but not so much that I would recommend buying a smaller size. If you like tshirts that don't cling to your frame this is a good buy.
4.0,"runs somewhat small, but I kept it. I figured it would be motivation to lose a few pounds. I rocked anyway and got lots of complements."
4.0,I love the look of these bags. They seem well made but I don‚Äôt think I would attempt to put 50 lbs in them.
4.0,"Very comfortable and love the colors very soft, very good price"
4.0,"I wore it already and it looks really really cool with trousers. I bought it for work and wore it the next day I got and received many compliments on it. The problem is I'm 5' but am a 36DD (38D) so I had to order the Large, it is SUPER long, I couldn't wear it untucked, not even with leggings. Love the color, love the fabric, it's not sheer at all. Great for the price."
4.0,"This item shipped very fast, was just as described but the size of it was very small. It definitely only fits my wrist or a baby ankle. Maybe a size 0 ankle.. Very cute item, too bad its a bracelet."
4.0,"I have had this for a week so far so go good. Mine has metal attachment points. Not sure why some pics from other reviewers show plastic.  The bright orange color does get dirty pretty quickly.  But it cleans up fairly nice by just washing the band while you wash your hands.  Overall happy with the product, one star removed as the attachment to the watch is slightly loose, it's not going to fall off but the tolerances good be better."
4.0,Purchased this for a festival look and got many compliments. I would size up as this is tight and kinda crop top.
4.0,Really nice bracelet
4.0,"I thought it would be a little softer, but maybe that will change with use."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Fits well, love the pockets, and so comfy! My only complaint is that after the first wash the material started to look worn. I've had it for almost a year now ands, although it still fits and feels great, the material looks old."
4.0,The small one looks funny but the rest are good
4.0,They work and look cute.<br /><br />I did try to take one out to move it and it ripped easily.  I guess for the price they are fine.
4.0,"Good fit, not crazy about the look of the material but they are comfortable"
4.0,I loved it. The only issue I had was that the top doesn't fit completely well. The bottom band folded into itself and it's hard to keep straighten. If you can get past that it's super cute. and that's a minor issue for the price and compliments.
4.0,Very cute but had to return it. Very short and I'm 5'4&#34;. Needs tights
4.0,"Super comfy, great color... the only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because it sheds."
4.0,"Cute, but darker than I wanted....I wanted real light blue quartz...."
4.0,"Very nice fitting top but the fabric does curl on the curve of the bodice where the decorative buttons are.  I know how to sew and can stitch it down.  So, I kept it."
4.0,Looked well made but looked more like womens than mens
4.0,Had a lot of fun getting fully dressed up in my plague doctor gear and taking a stroll around the neighborhood during this covid lockdown. Scared a lot of people. Totally worth the buy.<br /><br />Minor complain about the shape of the mask. Doesn‚Äôt fit amazingly around the jaw area but that‚Äôs not an issue. The ventilation hole while helpful don‚Äôt prevent the lenses from fogging.
4.0,great dress for price
4.0,"Nice, but I would not reorder."
4.0,"The red cuffs bleed in the wash. They're very soft material and cute as can be, but even washing in cold water didn't prevent the color bleeds so the body is now a pinkish color instead of white."
4.0,Fit as expected. Light weight material.
4.0,Beautiful and exactly what I expected.
4.0,Didn‚Äôt fit as expected but was super cute!!
4.0,wears out quickly but it was a great price.
4.0,fun stocking stuffers for grand children
4.0,"Too long..instead of riding at MidBack it rides on my hips.  Nothing that was shown, but I like the top otherwise"
4.0,"Gift for my son, nice quality except when peeling the sticker off some of the color was pulled off the ball, fixed with a brown marker."
4.0,Cute hat. Fit a little small but I stretched it out and now it's good.
4.0,"The pants were below my ankles, ankle pants should be 2-3 inches above ankle, these were not. Will keeep because they are perfect length for regular pants."
4.0,"it is kinda short  otherwise it fits great, print is strong doesnt wear off."
4.0,This bag has lasted several beach trips and has a good amount of space. The insulation is pretty good in the bottom cooler as well. One thing that would make it better an interior zipper and pockets.
4.0,"Great dress! I received so many compliments wearing it. I wore it for an event that I knew I would ruin it at the end of the night so I feel like I got the $26 worth for the day. Size wise I'm 5'4 and ordered a small, but it was very long! I couldn't wear heels so the dressed dragged all day. Everywhere else fit great though."
4.0,"This bag is very stylish inconvenient, the only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the bag was that if you weren‚Äôt using the plastic shell case for something wet, it was kind of annoying. But when you needed it for a wet bathing suit or towel, it was great. Love this bag!"
4.0,"This little purse is adorable--they didn't even show the &#34;muggle worthy&#34; clasps on the inside, which is awesome.  I took the long chain off and kept it was a hand clasp.  I love the little &#34;suitcase&#34; handle! (Also, it goes great with my niffler Funko Pop keychain!!!)<br /><br />Now, the downside:  when you put all your cards in the outer pocket (and I don't have an excessive amount), it becomes quite difficult to close.  I've had it pop open randomly, and as it holds all my important credit & debit cards and ID, it's quite scary when it just flops out.  I sort of want to undo the stitching on the outer pocket and keep it in the inside pocket, but as I'm unsure of the construction, im not sure if that'd ruin it.  I wish they'd have made the larger inside pocket fold out so that everything could be contained when buttoned closed.  The large pocket is quite nice for lip gloss and other small things, and I can fit my phone in there but as I have a large phone case (Mophie battery pack) it has trouble closed my with my phone in.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't pass up this adorable wallet clasp, and although it has a few problems, overall it's not so bad.‚ù§"
4.0,"Durable, stylish and enough room for my school materials. Price is ok."
4.0,Great price for 3 workout shirts.
4.0,Very cute looks like a dress but has the comfort of being shorts
4.0,My son liked it. He said it was very bright. The only bad thing is the next day he said his eyes hurt and he had a headache from the light being so bright.
4.0,"I purchased this briefcase for my son B-day present. As soon  as I opened the package to insert in gift bag, I noticed of the &#34;smell&#34; as some of reviews.  It was shipped in a symple plastic bag with protective pouch. A briefcase was &#34;flat&#34;, seemed very cheap one. So I stuff in with some towels, that way the briefcase expands and help to get a nice shape. After few days, it looked much better, and the smell was gone."
4.0,"This one has a ton of nice looking earrings, none of them seem overly cheap but don't expect real diamonds or anyting craazy like that...<br /><br />All in all I think if you like the price point and you like the styles this one has you will be happy with this set...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,"Super cute!! Bought it for my daughters birthday, she LOVED it!"
4.0,These are probably great for someone who can handle small twist things. I‚Äôm using these as a way to organize my stencils and to get to easily. Unfortunately for me unscrewing them can be a little difficult because they are pretty small. The stencils don‚Äôt weigh anything so I can‚Äôt say how much weight they can withstand. They do look well made.
4.0,"These look great, beautiful colors, lots of variety. Only concern is we bought a 00g, and the description says 00g, but it‚Äôs definitely smaller than a standard 00g, they‚Äôre more like a 0g."
4.0,My son has been using these for over a year and he is finally outgrowing them. They are good quality and thicker cotton material. Nice designs as well and he enjoyed using them.
4.0,My teen daughter loves this dress.
4.0,"I purchased 2 one for each of my kids. One jogger size 14-16, one jogger size 18-20‚Ä¶. Unfortunately the size 14-16 was too small, so I ended using the 18-20 for my 12 year old. So I suggest you size up. My 12 year old is almost 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weight  a little less than 100 pounds"
4.0,Lovely color and fabric but lots of lycra...and a little more form-fitting than the picture shows.  Order a size up.
4.0,I love this dress but the XL did not fit me on top. It is the perfect length on me and I loved the pockets but if you are around a C or D cup it won't fit you on top.
4.0,"A little on the heavy side but very solid construction. The hooks on the satchel itself (as opposed to the top) make the carrying strap work better than other similar models. The leather is thick and heavy duty giving the satchel a rugged solid look.<br /><br />The only issue I had with it any the reason I marked down to 4 stars is how easily the leather could be marked: accidental brushes against fingernails or a wall or anything remotely unyielding will leave marks. I imagine that in time, the marks will all blend together and give the satchel a pleasant weathered look. But so far it (a couple weeks) it just seems rather scruffy."
4.0,"Really like this and it fits perfectly, however, a bit itchy, but then, I have sensitive skin.  Works well with long sleeve tops so can work around the itchiness."
4.0,Love it!!! (:
4.0,I cycle I love bright colors and different jerseys this was it
4.0,"Good quality, beautiful top, a little large, but is a good purchases"
4.0,It‚Äôs super small like tony studs but they‚Äôre cute
4.0,"The pattern is cute and the fabric is a nice soft cotton. I wear a camisole underneath for modesty, as the front is cut quite low."
4.0,Very fast shipment! They are just fine! Thank you
4.0,"This is, as other reviews mention, super soft. It is a viscose blend, so I hope it will hold up over time."
4.0,Great-looking watch was a little worried when the box arrived a little damage but the watch is fine. It really goes with everything that you wear I like it a lot
4.0,Beautiful dress and good quality. The material is a little thick but it does compliment the body. I'm usually a size 10/ 5'9/ 170 lbs and 36d. I will have to pin the top or wear a cami.
4.0,"Beautiful colors, will make me feel pretty. It really has a problem with static cling, but I hope I can remedy that"
4.0,Like these a lot better than I thought I would. I did order a half size up because of the rounded toe.
4.0,"Cute, ended up returning due to the shape not looking good with my face shape but my friend loved them"
4.0,Light weight - runs large.
4.0,Really comfortable! Made well. Magically delicious!!
4.0,great leather! the buckle is a bit big. So it might look better with watches over 42mm.
4.0,The  hoodie is great. My daughter loves it. My only complaint is they sent me a t-shirt by mistake. I will say as soon as notified them of the mistake they promptly sent the the hoodie out.
4.0,"Very soft fabric, love the fit"
4.0,"Had no problems sublimating on these scarves. They were bigger than I expected but it turned out to be a good thing...exactly what I needed. Gave it 4 stars because I wish it came in other Light colors like light blue, light pink, etc."
4.0,"Good fit, but they had about an extra foot of fabric past my feet.. surprisingly long pants, I was not able to walk while wearing them, had to return"
4.0,"Cute for a costume , but not as an every day accessory"
4.0,"The color is gorgeous and the style is beautiful. Unfortunately for me, it clings too much to the bra area, and it shows bulges. I have plenty of other items like this, but this just doesn't work."
4.0,I liked the purse but I thought it would be a different color.
4.0,"This is really pretty fabric that moves nicely. One star off because the waistband is weirdly thick: note that you will basically have to wear it with a shirt that doesn‚Äôt cover the waist band or you will look like two inches thicker in the waist. If you wear it like the picture it looks fine, and the length is as pictured."
4.0,I just I just got them they run small I got a plus size and I'm only a size 6-8 but they are soft which I wanted and they're black there longer than I thought I'm 5 foot 5 I want a little shorter but they're almost 5 inches for my ankle but I'll keep them I'm washing them now they're hanging dry they're soft and book cover me up if that's what I want to do something really soft
4.0,"These are very very pretty.  I bought what is called 'Yellow'.  Just know that these pants are orange.  The background is a kind of saffron and the floral pattern is a bright orange.  Nevertheless, these pants are a comfortable, light, crisp cotton.  And not too long...I'm short-ish and they come  to near the bottom of my heel but don't quite touch the floor.  Also, this particular color does not have pockets...the 'Magenta' does have pockets...why?"
4.0,"it's very pretty but seems to be a bit larger then the normal size a belly button piercing should be.  My neice doesn't wear it because she doesn't want her tummy skin to have a big stretched out hole. its unfortunate because like i said,  it is very pretty."
4.0,"My problem with these comfy pants is that they are too tight around my lower calf, probably because I am 52 years old and need to lose 25 pounds.  It's  hard for something to be one size fits all and work out but they are great otherwise.  Still, I will return just because they calf tightness bothers me.  I could wear them as is but would rather not have that irritate me."
4.0,La calidad es muy buena pero el tama≈Ño es mas grande de lo esperado
4.0,"This dress runs small. Bought it for my daughter she normally fits into a 4, I had to buy an 8. It fit very well and look great."
4.0,"It was a lovely dress and very comfortable. The lace was soft and not itchy.  Ordered my regular size and it fit well. Was slightly too big in the chest area, but I think it was because I have a short torso."
4.0,I purchased these baby pajamas thinking they had a double zipper but they don't so it makes the price too high. However they are soft and not too thin also the olive green color is quite nice so I will keep them.
4.0,This is dress is nice and looks great. Although it is a little transparent but I am very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Great mask, but good luck putting the pieces together!  The instructions are in Chinese, so use google translate, and they still don't make all that much sense."
4.0,Great value and lovely dress! A little loose fitting though...
4.0,Very soft and high quality material. Unfortunately it's one of those cuts that is wide and short and fits big. Luckily I'm a short person so it doesn't affect me as much as people who are taller.
4.0,"They are pretty short on my foot and wish they were longer on the leg, like all the colors"
4.0,"Material is more like a swimsuit, but daughter loved it."
4.0,"the left sleeve looks like it had been splashed with some kind of bleach.  I am going to keep the shirt as it is only for working out at home and a little extra warmth when it gets cold down here in Florida, but if it was for other than that I would send it back."
4.0,Too gold to seem exactly believable for the average 14k but the fit is super and comfortable.
4.0,Annoying zipper in back.  Need someone to zip it up for you
4.0,Nice top for the price. Does run a bit small so might want to order up depending on how you want it to fit.
4.0,"I like this hat. The bill seems to want to snap back to flat, though. So, you have to keep bending it while you wear it. But it's a nice, cheap, light hat."
4.0,"I think it's a great concept and as a whole I like them. I like the fact that there's no tail and they are adjustable. Exactly what I was looking for but I found two downsides for me. First, even at it's tightest setting, they are still too big for me. It does prevent my glasses from falling off my face, but because it's still loose they still go halfway down the bridge of my nose. When I would rest my head on the back of my couch, they would push forward so I wasn't able to rest my head while watching tv. Also once you put these on your glasses, trying to get them off was quite a challenge. Kudos to the company for making them so secure, but I thought I was going to break the arms of my glasses trying to get them off, but I eventually did. So...overall I would recommend this product, maybe I just have a small head. LOL."
4.0,I'm 6' 4&#34;.  These are a little short on me.  Keep me warm tho
4.0,"A great watch.  Really good luminosity in the dark and doesn't need a bright light shine on it beforehand.  While the crown is loose (as with all this watch variety for some reason) it is easy to wind and set the time.  Finally, it keeps very accurate time..as good as my Casio GShock watch which is synchronized to a satellite!!!"
4.0,"The quality and manufacturing are top of the line and should last for many years.  I've been delighted in the comfort and can wear them all day without any discomfort.  The only downsides I've found is that I wear a 10.5m US and was not given the option for my size so had to order a size 11.0 US, and lack of a heel on the upper back-side.  Overall a very good product with only the few gripes I've noted.  I do recommend these as long as the consumer is aware of the size limitations."
4.0,good one for outdoor pool
4.0,"I like this dress but it was WAY too big!!!! had to send back due to size. I am 5'1&#34; /130 pounds and ordered a medium, which I always wear."
4.0,Love the way they fit and feel although they do run small
4.0,Nice and dark...but a lil small for a grown mans head
4.0,"I ordered three of these:  black, gold, and silver.  The black and silver are super great.  I love them and get tons of compliments.  The &#34;gold&#34; is not at all gold.  Not even close.  It's shiny brown.  Lame.<br /><br />Update:<br />I ordered the new style in silver.  I liked that it is more comfortable than the first ones I got.  But, it wore out fast.  I've worn it about 12 times and the band is worn and the loop broke.  :("
4.0,Necklace and bracelet are round. The one string are chips. Some way bigger then others.
4.0,Great watch amazing colors but the strap clip thing at the end is very loose
4.0,Bought the Shirt for a gift. He loved it.
4.0,"Although I won‚Äôt be using this purse for a couple of months, I‚Äôve checked it out and it seems very well made.  It has a nice chain strap, big enough for phone, comb, lipstick, tissues and probably more!  I choose the champagne color to match my taupe shoes - good match. The only downfall I see with it is the glitter. Just as anything with glitter, it gets everywhere. But it's so pretty, it's definitely worth the extra sparkle!"
4.0,They fit small. I still wear them though just not is I'm going to be on my feet all day
4.0,"Super cute, but more pinkish than red-- Which I actually preferred and chose because of the reviews. I ordered a size bigger than it suggested, and it was still a little tighter than I'd hoped. It still looked amazing!"
4.0,I got this for my 11 y/o daughter.  I wore it a couple times and got compliments!  Worth the money ;)
4.0,"These shoes are a good buy for the money.  They perform as a good cycling shoe ought to.  The platform is solid, and the uppers offer appropriate ventilation. The overall construction is well above average. I would have given them five stars but for the fact that they are rather narrow in width, as are the majority of China-made shoes that I have come across.  If you have a narrow foot, then they will suit you very well, but anything other than that, it will be necessary to use a shoe stretcher, or endure discomfort on the bike.  You'll need to be patient with the stretching process, as the synthetic material the uppers are made of is resilient and tends to return to the original shape shortly after they're out of the stretcher.  I have been stretching mine for over a month and by now they are quite comfortable.  The size chart offered by Shimano is accurate."
4.0,Don't have one
4.0,"I have very small wrists, so this bracelet is perfect. When I wear other bracelets, lots of times, people can't even see the bracelet I'm wearing because it slides up my arm so much. I'm waiting to see if there are any discoloration, but it is great so far."
4.0,I seriously wear it almost every day.
4.0,"I'm highly sensitive to nickel on my skin. After 3 days of wearing this band, I unfortunately started showing allergic reaction. Since I was camping, I thought it was a bug bite and continued wearing it for another day before I realized what was going on. Too late! ...I'm planning to replace the buckle with a silver one that has a PVD coating. 20 mm buckle for the 22 mm band. I love it besides that."
4.0,It's a pretty dress but the fabric that covers the breasts is very very see through!!!!
4.0,"Bought this for my neice for her birthday last year.. . .  And she actually used it in public!!!!  Winner, so when the California urban wildfires took her home; bought her this replacement."
4.0,They weren't as flexible le as I had hoped but we're easy to customize the size.
4.0,"Cute top and fits well. Just be warned if you have to squat down to pick something up just remember to scoop up the back part of the shirt. Otherwise you step on it, get stuck on your shoe, and then fall over. Just saying for a friend. ;)"
4.0,"Very cute, perfect with workout leggings. Reasonably priced. Will order more colors."
4.0,"Ordered 2 sizes up, Perfect fit, but fabric does not give &#34;at all&#34;, so I'm a little concerned about sitting through an evening gala. Would have given 5 stars if it had just a little stretch through the hips."
4.0,Good fit... Perfect size for work
4.0,Posts are really long so I had to cut them. They ended up falling out of my nose fairly regularly once the post is cut. They tarnish/change color really quickly. Was hoping for a little better quality. I wouldn't order this again.
4.0,Great bag for the price.  You can fit a lot in it.
4.0,Beautiful dress......
4.0,"The bottom half of the dress fit well, but the shoulders were too large/wide.  They did not fit well and it looked sloppy.  I'm concerned that if I tried to order a size smaller, the lower half of the dress might be too tight.  The material and color are nice.  The dress felt comfortable.  Other than the shoulders/neckline of the dress being too large, the dress has a nice design."
4.0,"As per the other reviews, I ordered a size down. The jeans fit as expected, although I wish the cuffs were a little more ‚Äúskinny‚Äù. I had to return this order as there was purple ink on the jeans, but did place a replacement order."
4.0,I like it so much that I bought it in 3 different colors
4.0,"The sunglasses came in a very nice case and had lens wipes which was nice. I dropped the glasses and no the ground left no scratches, so they seem durable. The pink lenses look great and work great as sunglasses."
4.0,I really like the metal.  Small round connector ring way too small and flimsey.  Made a substitute and it is working well/
4.0,"They seem pretty comfortable and fit well. I don't notice I'm wearing them, and they help with leg pain. Who wants to pay $40 for a pair of socks?"
4.0,Good fit and I like the style for the price
4.0,I like that it is compact and built pretty sturdy. It holds my cards and phone all together.<br />I like the material and the patterns of the flowers.
4.0,"I wasn‚Äôt expecting a whole lot since I‚Äôm a 36G/38F and finding cute bras without underwire is almost impossible for me, but this definitely exceeds expectations.<br /><br />The fabric is stretchy enough not be constricting, but still has decent support. The padded inserts keep it from being a total monoboob like a lot of sports bras/bralettes in this style. I love how comfortable it is, I could probably sleep in it, and it‚Äôs just a bit cuter than a normal sports bra.<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like is the lack of adjustable straps, though that‚Äôs in the picture. The fabric is also a bit hot. For my bra size, the 2x I ordered is a little small in the cups (which was expected) and a 3x would have been way too big in the band, so busty girls be aware of that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this as a fairly cheap alternative to lingerie store bralettes, which are much more expensive for just one."
4.0,"Got this for my daughter she loves it and I love it, I may have to borrow it from her LOL"
4.0,Very cute.  But a little baggy.
4.0,It's heave
4.0,The tip of the beak on the actual product is pointer and the mouth doesn't open and close as easily as it does in the advertisements.<br /><br />This mask still made my friends laugh. So I am satisfied with the product because it met its purpose.
4.0,Love them<br />I have been wanting overalls again for a while but it's hard to find my size and something that looks cute.<br />These definitely succeeded<br />My disappointment is in the fabric being a bit slippery and one of my pockets ripping after only one were<br />But looks really good in and I will remain happy with it as long as nothing else rips
4.0,"Odd to have the zipper on the wrong side, but it's well made and a great value. Plenty of pockets."
4.0,Dress fit well and made the occasion it was purchased for wonderful.
4.0,"I should have paid more attention to the description, so it is entirely my fault for expecting something I did not get. I was prepared for a winter face shield for warmth during the cold weather and hunting season for my husband."
4.0,Pretty and different look.  Versatile piece of jewelry ... Works well with jeans and a tshirt or dresses up a top and pair of slacks.  Would make a cute gift.
4.0,"Good quality fabric, comfy and warm. Just what I wanted."
4.0,"It's an attractive tie, but the blue is VERY bright--brighter than it looks in the picture. My husband says he doesn't mind, but we'll see how often he actually wears it."
4.0,I ordered this in small and it did end up running a little large. The color and design are accurate to the description.  This sweater is very cozy and still looks ok even thought it‚Äôs a little large on my.<br /><br />The material is very soft and feels well made.  The cut is higher in the front and longer in the back and the button detail coming up the side is very cute.<br /><br />This is ‚Äúfall sweater weather‚Äù appropriate and pairs well with skinny jeans and knee high fall boots.<br /><br />My only issue with this is the fact that is pulls so easily.  Almost every time I wear it I find a new section that‚Äôs been caught on something (I have no clue what) and it causes the sweater itself to look messy.  You can see the areas in my picture where it is now flawed. I don‚Äôt know how to fix this or prevent it from further happening but I really do love this sweater and want to continue wearing it without damaging it more.
4.0,Beautiful but a little heavy for regular wear. But great for special occasions. Arrived quickly and packaged well. Just what I expected.
4.0,"I love this bracelet with all honesty. The only downside with this bracelet is it's big and although adjustable, it unravels (loosens its self).  The only way for the bracelet to stay on tight (for me) I put small knots after I adjust how tight I want it to be on my wrists. Don't knot too tight if you want to take off and place it back on."
4.0,These are cheap but they exceeded my expectations. They have a great fit and the frame is quite sturdy.
4.0,The size is too small. I wear US small size and ordered medium size but it is still small as for me.<br />The design is so great but I can't keep it.
4.0,"Good coverage. Wish they were a bit darker, but they are darker than most."
4.0,"It is long, but so is everything else I buy, unless it a petite brand.<br />The chest seems slightly tight."
4.0,Love the dress. Only issue is with me being 5ft is too long. I had to tye knot on side to help it from hanging down.but still love it.
4.0,Beautiful dress and fabric.  Very flattering fit!
4.0,Good quality. A bit longer than expected. Not as flattering as expected.
4.0,"I like the color - easy to find inside my black purse, but it holds very few items.  I cannot put in all my credit cards, my license, my insurance card - just not very functional.<br />It does hold a few passports at one time in one compartment and will use it when I travel."
4.0,Love this dress. The back is low but not so los that your uncomfortable sitting. The material is a little heavy but great quality.
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable, but very casual - bordering on sloppy. You can pair it with jeans around the house and even out in the yard, but out in public only if you hang with a very chill crowd. It's a ""maybe"" for a movie theatre depending on your friends, and a definitely ""no"" for a date unless you're hiking"
4.0,The band felt a little snug at first but when I wore the second time I didn‚Äôt even notice. Material has a nice feel and the support is good for at home work outs.
4.0,"The pocket to hold the filter is slightly smaller than the filter, so it gets bent in there, which is ironic because it caused me to have a meltdown when I didn't bring my spare mask and I had to wear that all day... I guess I'll wear it without the filter"
4.0,like the hat but a little big.
4.0,"I only gave it 4 starts because I bought these for myself, not for females. It‚Äôs too big, but they fit my husband great and looks so nice!"
4.0,I like it --  it's perfect for a cover-up at the beach
4.0,Nice pillows - was very satisfied with the quality.  Wish they had been a little bigger!
4.0,"Fits great! I normally wear a size 8.5-9, so I ordered 9 and they fit perfect. I'm 5'11&#34; and they ho above my knee which is amazing since I can never find a pair that does. My only issue is that there's practically no tread so I'm sliding around on my floor but I can fix that. Definitely going to buy the black fake leather for everyday since these will mostly be for cosplaying."
4.0,"I love this hat, but wish it wasn‚Äôt shipped folded. I steamed and laid stuff on the rim to straighten, but there are still creases I wish weren‚Äôt there. Overall this hat is exactly what I wanted."
4.0,back is cheap looking but  it  is okay enough to create the illusion of a really nice piece
4.0,This dress is very pretty and very well made. Zero complaints on quality! Colors are vibrant and I received many compliments. My only drawback is that it was a little shorter than I like with a maxi dress. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù so I realize that is taller than usual. I highly recommend trying this dress!
4.0,"Not supportive, but cute under tops and strappy dresses."
4.0,Good product but won't fit over keys with chip.
4.0,room for everything in their own spaces not crowded  accessible to all areas
4.0,"Sexy beach cover up, love it!"
4.0,Be aware - each color is sized slightly different. I have the red and black one and the teal and white one. Both in a medium.<br />The red one is PERFECT and long enough. the teal is kind of tight and a bit shorter.
4.0,really pretty but had to return because the top didn't fit me well. not as gorgeous as the picture but very nice quality for the price.
4.0,"I was a bit confused the fist day I wore it as people kept calling me Heisenberg. So far it seems well constructed. It holds its shape well. It is a bit taller than I was looking for but I think it actually looks better on me that way.<br /> Excuse me, I have some cooking to do."
4.0,"Way too tight on my (fairly flat) booty, so def not appropriate for work. Otherwise very cute."
4.0,"Great watch for the price, although I was surprised at how small it is, so I had to give it to my girlfriend. She loves it!"
4.0,almost 100 % like<br />my only dislike is no free shipping to Palau. or any amount you reach then you become eligible for free shipping
4.0,"This set was very cute and very well made but turned my daughter's finger black the first time she wore them. One of the smaller ones broke the third day. I still think for $10, this set was worth it."
4.0,"This is a very pretty & feminine top, the lace make your shoulders look a bit large and can be a bit unflattering for some people."
4.0,"Just like all of the other reviews, dress is super cute but is really, really short.  I wore it with leggings and booties and it was fine."
4.0,Did not expect it to be so large.
4.0,A little large in the chest
4.0,"Color shown is fairly accurate.  I bought this for a costume so I'm not too concerned about long-term durability with frequent wear.  The material of the belt is thicker than I expected so it's pretty stiff.  Overall, good deal for my purposes"
4.0,The fabric was thicker than I thought and the style runs big.
4.0,"I love the look of this necklace, but it doesn‚Äôt stay in place too well. The design could have been better to remediate that, but I still really like this necklace!"
4.0,XxL is Asian large = Medium.
4.0,This fleece is super cute and runs pretty true to size. It‚Äôs super soft and actually long enough for someone with a longer torso (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 140lbs ordered a size small). The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because I wish the sleeves were a little longer. Definitely a great fleece and I would recommend! :)
4.0,"This dress is lovely, as to fit and attractiveness, for a daily work-wear context or for wearing to church. However, the tie is awkward. It won't stay tied, unless you tie it so tightly that the fabric pleats and looks sloppy. I had to take a stitch in the bow, once I tied it, in order to get it to stay without looking cheap or damaged. I can't say this is a deal-breaker, but it is something you should be aware of, prior to purchase. Overall, this is a solid four star dress with one significant flaw. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
4.0,Thought these were 100% wool but they aren't.
4.0,Unique and eyecatching. Lightweight.
4.0,"The top is super cute and is a pretty good soft fabric(meaning not itchy at all), If you want your top to be loose you probably wanna go a size up. The pants now are a weird fabric and a bit boxy by the waist area and the elastic band going around is pretty tight, but I only got this for the top so everything‚Äôs fine for me :)"
4.0,"much cheaper than another brand I bought.  I tried to cut these in half to make a headband that is not so much fabric but it doesn't work out that way.  It just slips off. I can use this under my rock climbing helmet and it prevent the helmet from sliding around when looking up and down belaying someone.  I can also wear it as a removable hat when horse riding when I don't have a pocket big enough for a winter hat.  It can either sit on my neck  until I get home ( makes my neck hot tho ) or I can double it up a few times and wear as a wrist band.<br />In extreme cold and wind chill I can wear one under my hood to cover my forehead, wear ski googles,  and another 1 or two to cover my nose and mouth and neck.  If I lose one in the woods I'm not out much money. I can't say they look cool.  My kids think they look silly on me. Function over fashion."
4.0,Nice smooth wood. Delicate post to secure. Very hard to put on by yourself.  Get someone to put them on for you.
4.0,Looks great on and doesn't catch my hair and rip it out. I like the weight and thickness of the piece.
4.0,Seemed like decent jewelry but smaller than anticipated.
4.0,So this is a nice thick material and a good quality. The cut is very flattering if you want something fitted.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 154lbs.  The first size chart (measurements) puts me in a medium. The second one (weight/height) puts me in an XL ü§î I went with the medium since the measurements seemed more precise. It fits but is VERY snug and fitted.  I‚Äôm curious how the large would have fit so I may order that to compare.
4.0,XXXL was about XL size. Material is good and comfortable. But little transparent.
4.0,Love these but the backing isn‚Äôt secure. I lost both of the backs the same day I put them on.
4.0,the only thing that would make it perfect is if it had a magnetic clasp
4.0,Good price. Washed only a few times and still holding up. I read the reviews for sizing and fits as expected.
4.0,"So I sized up, I have a pair of shorts from a different brand that is a size smaller and they fit but are a little tight and have no stretch so I thought I'd get these in a larger size. I didn't realize they were super stretchy. They fit but I do have to wear a belt to keep them up in the right spot. I like that they're stretchy and if I wasn't leaving for a road trip I would have sent them back and gotten a smaller size but I didn't have enough time. The length is great, not too long, not too short. a few inches above my knee but not so short I feel uncomfortable."
4.0,The outer dress was perfect but I did not like the cut on the sleeves of the under dress. I ended up wear a different dress underneath. I needed a quick and cheap outfit to make a Hobbit Cosplay. If you have broader shoulders and thicker biceps the sleeve ( at least on mine) were tight.
4.0,"Really pretty blouse, it's a bit on the small side. I can't wait to wear it and the belt is a nice touch."
4.0,Great looking bag. I had about 40lbs of clothing and whatnot with me on my last trip. I ended up walking all over the damn place with it strapped to me and not a single thread came loose. The bag is a little heavy already but style means sacrifices. The leather is high quality and it is indeed waterproof as it was raining on our walk to the ferry.<br />I just wish it was a bit lighter.
4.0,"Nice goggles.  Finally got to a poo, to try them.  They are indeed watertight, although for me, they seem a bit uncomfortable around the bridge of the nose.  Could be me -- could be the goggles."
4.0,"First of all, these arrived in less than half the expected time! I ordered a size 7 which I normally get for tennis shoes. They went on snug, although, I am 8 1/2 months pregnant. But I do have wide feet otherwise.  They weren't to the point of being uncomfortable, just take some extra pushing/pulling to get off and on. The snug part is in the arch, I also have high arches."
4.0,[[ASIN:B071F753T5 Mens RFID Blocking Wallets Bifold Slim Carbon Fiber Leather Trifold Wallet Purse Black]].<br />It's a very nice wallet.
4.0,Size was accurate but camisoles are way too long and tend to bulk when I put my pants on.
4.0,"If you look closely, you will see that these jeans are cut-off at the bottom, and not hemmed.  But they are stitched above the cut, so hopefully they will not fray too much.  They are a dark black color, though not a solid black.  They have a high waist, so some might even consider them ‚Äúmom jeans‚Äù.  The inseam is 29‚Äù.  Make sure you place your mouse over the picture from the front, right below the knee.  You will see a ‚Äúflap‚Äù of material.  This has also been cut, and is not sewn above, so it will probably fray more over time.  It is sewn to the leg, so a hole should not be created.  This ‚Äúflap‚Äù is on the front only, and not the back.  The leg opening is 7‚Äù across at the bottom.  These jeans are 100% cotton.  There is no stretch.  They are your basic denim, meaning that they have a fairy heavy weight, and are not all that soft, but not super rough either.  They are Made in Vietnam."
4.0,Such a cute shirt for a little girl with curly hair<br />It was a little big on the bottom half of the shirt
4.0,"This dress is see-through, so you have to wear a long cami underneath. Top & mid section snug, dress flares at the bottom. I'm 5'4, 140lbs, size B. Got a medium. Fits well."
4.0,"Pros: beautiful deep green. I LOVE the color. The cut is interesting and feels very retro. The zipper is smooth, quality is good. I found it slimming.<br />Cons: I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to tie the neck. I wish that it had included an instruction sheet with suggestions. I also think that the neck could have been cut just a little bit smaller to prevent the fabric being pulled down by the weight of the tie.<br /><br />I am 42 YO, 145#, 36D, 5‚Äô6 and a large is slightly big on me. I think a medium would have been too small in the bust. If you are looking for a dress that is unique, this is for you."
4.0,Very comfortable and washes very nicely.
4.0,Great Christmas gift and very fluffy inside
4.0,I like the material the length is very pretty the only thing i didnt like was the line in the front it would be better on the back of the dress but i would definitely recommend this dress
4.0,"They fit well, but the balls are sometimes difficult to get on."
4.0,"Loved the color and concept. Of only I could stop dropping every single thing. Once the soap is on, forget it. Do not use for dishes if you do not have great control or dexterity. Will be using these to wash my car."
4.0,"I shave my head and have found that hats without a fleece lining maybe me itch. This fleece lined stocking cap is very comfortable on my enormous head. The gloves fit nicely too on my pudgy hands. My only complaint is that the are some loose threads and quite a bit of fuzz. Packaging is very basic, so not something that I would gift to another person."
4.0,Loved them!!! But they come apart easily
4.0,Fun and whimsical! Great conversation starter.  Got it as a funny gift for my 16 year old...she loved it! Very light weight.
4.0,"The material is a bit stiff and feels a little cheap, but does it‚Äôs job. I played tennis with these sunglasses and they were the perfect size (25yo female). It‚Äôs nice that it comes with a screw driver that helps loosen or tighten the hinges. It was definitely a nice surprise!"
4.0,"I like these. A little tight in calves, but cute for a fan."
4.0,My 12 year old granddaughter loved this piece of jewelry and shared it with a friend the next day. The chain didn't prove to be that durable but she was able to place the charm on another chain and it is still in use.
4.0,Its too short for me and it its a little tight around the armpit area.  But it is what I expected!
4.0,Cute comfortable sweatshirt. Just as described. Fits perfect. Covers tush so great for leggings.
4.0,Served as designed
4.0,"The belt looks cute, but the belt is not leather."
4.0,"This is a good tote, nice size and easy to handle -- but there's no sign of any inside pockets, zippered or otherwise."
4.0,"its cute but runs small ,I normally wear a medium, ordered a large. Ut still feel small. Not stretch in it at all.wouldnt recommend if u want something really comfy"
4.0,I bought these to wear with my 80‚Äôs costume for Halloween and I got tons of compliments on them. They weren‚Äôt too heavy but they didn‚Äôt want to face the right way so the front of the cassette could be seen. I tried to rotate them on the earring part and they still wouldn‚Äôt hang right. Then one kept falling off of the hardware and I had to search for it several times. Over all the concept of these earrings is great and they‚Äôre adorable they‚Äôre just not the easiest earrings to deal with.
4.0,The size was about 2 sizes too small even though it said I ordered the correct size. I think it just runs a size or two smaller.
4.0,Bought the yellow one. Not the same color that it appears in the series but is a warm and comfortable hoodie regardless.
4.0,Expected the material to be a little thicker but to thin for me.
4.0,"The only thing the buttons on the neck are super hard to get in & out of, my hub‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt home, baby was crying & I panicked because I couldn‚Äôt get the buttons! Haha other than that, perfect & doesn‚Äôt wrinkle after washing!!"
4.0,This is great for those warmer days - it fit a little larger than expected at first but after a hot wash it fit better - I am very petite so this would be perfect without shrinking it for the normal body xx.  I will definitely purchase in other colors again xx
4.0,It was a little smaller than it looked in the pic but is still a pretty fascinator. I needed all white so this was perfect for me. I prefer clips so used the one that came with it and it stayed on beautifully. There's also a headband if you prefer.
4.0,This dress is beautiful and so comfortable. It does run a little big.
4.0,I thought I was a medium so that‚Äôs what I got. I was feeling like small would be too tight. I like the dress. It would have been perfect if the skirt part had a made in slip. I kinda felt exposed.
4.0,The color was a little off. It looks more peach than beige but still cute. My granddaughter loved it and she looked like a little princess in it.
4.0,"Nice colour, nice fabric, as it appears in the photo"
4.0,"I bought these for my bridal party to wear when getting ready. They are very soft and comfortable, and I‚Äôll be wearing mine again. I like the drawstring so you can tighten them if needed. They run really small, though. I returned and reordered a size up for everyone. I am a 6 in shorts, and I had to order a size large for myself."
4.0,The zipper kind of stuck and had strings coming out but was a great buy for the price.
4.0,"I like them, but if you are a male get extra large."
4.0,"Worked well for what it was purchased for! I bought it for a Wonder Woman costume. It sheds a little glitter, but nothing major. It doesn't slip out of place, but the foam backing does cause a little sweat. Overall a good product."
4.0,Good quality. Should last a long time.
4.0,work right
4.0,This bracelet is cute. I thought that it may be a bit smaller but when I tried it on it was perfect. It covered up my wrist completely
4.0,It's a bit short..
4.0,"Sadly the shirt small but the pants were just right, maybe next but it was a cute outfit!"
4.0,"I loved this bra the first 2-3 times I used it but unfortunately it lost the stickiness rather quickly. The strings to tighten it also started to rip the first time I wore it. However, it works well when I have on a tight top because the top kinda holds it in place. Overall, it‚Äôs decent quality I just wish it would have lasted longer."
4.0,I found them too tight. The thumb whole was not big enough to accommodate my thumbs and the opening had to be physically stretched until the seam popped. The material does not stretch enough to fit large arms.
4.0,was a gift for daughter in law for  getting her  Real Estate license she likes it I have not seen it
4.0,"Looks great, soft . Just unpacked and u fortunatelly black is noticeably smaller then other two, says same size thou. Not sure if that will fit, wish i can change just one to the right size"
4.0,Works well to keep sun off baby's face.
4.0,Really pretty but doesn‚Äôt last very long before the elastic strings break. I do get more compliments on this watch band than I do on expensive pieces of jewelry.
4.0,Nice but it's for style not warmth. Fits a bit small. It looks very good. Cute. I'd buy again
4.0,"I love this dress, but I ordered it in a large and it was too large but the medium was too small."
4.0,"Being only 64"" in diameter, they are not long enough to wrap twice... it feels/looks more like an ascot than an infinity scarf because it is so tight/short."
4.0,I use for swing dancing. This shoes is good enough for beginner swing dance which I  am. They are very comfortable. Love the leather sole make very easy to spin.<br />It would be better if the upper make off leather too for durable and not easy scratching. Also it would be better to have a quick realease buckle for quick and easy put in and take off
4.0,"I bought this strap to go with my Seiko SRP777 and it looks quite nice with it. I like how the strap tapers a bit towards the buckle, which makes the watch look less bulky. I knocked off one star because the strap feels a bit &#34;foam&#34; like, and very light as far as weight is concerned. But on the contrary, the strap is supple and curves to the wrist well. As for the color, we'll see how well it holds up over time. Note that if you have the fat pins from Seiko diver watches, you give it a push through the end holes and it should go in without a problem."
4.0,"I love this dress - it points out my curves well. Only two small setbacks: it is printed, so when I (a 36C girl) wears it, the print stretches and turns white a little. Second setback is that if you put it in the wash, the fabric is picked at a little so you get these little white dots fluff up, but not too noticeable."
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet, my daughter loved it."
4.0,"Hope is comes quickly, I could really use it for a display!"
4.0,"These are okay polarized aviators for the price of just $12.99, however I get a lot of blur and sun bleeding through while I'm driving. I still find myself putting my visor down or covering my forehead with my hand. When I have them on for walking, hiking, fishing, or even just for use at work on the farm, they're a non issue. They fit my face well, and provide enough wiggle room in the arms to fit a wider jaw structure. I'd get these again, but I won't rely on them as my daily wearers for driving."
4.0,"Nice. Update on a classic. Fabric is decent. Definitely summer fabric though it is kind of thin and opague. I was surprised the bottom is kind of an upside down v-shape. So the middle is shorter than the sides like a triangle shape was cut out. (Maybe the pictures dont empahasize this enough? Or maybe it hangd differently on a stick figured woman. Im 5'3&#34; 165lbs and curvy. I wanted a more even, straight classic hemline instead of fad-ish but its ok."
4.0,I I think that these earrings are gorgeous. They are a bit big and heavier than expected so they would be better a little smaller and lighter.
4.0,"I like the lightness of this fabric.  It is perfect for keeping me clean when I'm working with horse and goat manure and mud or in the garden.  I needed one big pocket for my phone- with a zipper, and it has it."
4.0,Package came damaged and opened 2 out of the 4 bands came damaged from the part that needs to be connected to the watch making it hard to attach to Apple Watch and Not smooth.
4.0,"I received these about a week ago, to replace a pair of backings on antique diamond earrings that kept falling off. They fit well and are substantially more secure than normal backings.  That said they are not perfect - one popped off in a dressing room last weekend after getting caught on my scarf. It was a substantial tug though, so I felt it right away and found the backing easily."
4.0,"This is a really cute  top, the fabric is Linen not jersey or T-shirt I think describing as T-shirt is misleading. No stretching at all, It did not fit,<br />But overall it is a beautiful top."
4.0,These are light weight and easy to wear. Just throw them in the laundry and come out clean.
4.0,A little too sheer but otherwise good affordable workout shirts. Love the purple.
4.0,These yoga pants are very comfortable. The print on it is adorable and it has a lot of room to stretch which I like a lot. High quality and great stitch.
4.0,üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº
4.0,"I like the accuracy of the mask, the only real downside was the eye cut outs were pretty small kinda hard to see through."
4.0,I have this dress in green. I usually try to wear long sleeve to cover my tats at work. This dress is light weight and comfy . Deff good for summer ! WIll be ordering every color they offer.
4.0,Loved the look but would have liked an easier clasp for the bracelet.
4.0,"I bought this jacket to wear on my trip to Colorado. It fits perfect, lightweight and super cute. The only thing is that it took almost a week to receive and I didn‚Äôt get it in time for my trip. Also was very wrinkly. I have steamed it several times and hasn‚Äôt got all the wrinkles out but I still wear it üòú"
4.0,The Acorn Anorak shoe really was a hit for a gift at Christmas.  The recipient put them on as soon as they were opened and thinks they are the greatest.  Good quality and a great value
4.0,"Very cute, but waaaay too big for my daughter's head.  Maybe by the time she is 6 months or so...?"
4.0,These trousers seem to be well constructed the waist is right at a 34&#34; fully extended the inseam must be a 36&#34; but when life doesn't fit we make alterations. I'm not sure about the 80% polyester material we'll have to see how it wears before I order more.I would like to say thank's Military _1st for fast shipping from UK to USA.
4.0,"Material is light and moisture wicking. However, read the title of this review and you‚Äôll be satisfied with your purchase."
4.0,"I purchased this item for a convention last week, but it didn't show up on time. It actually arrived during the convention, which was disappointing for me..<br />I am a US medium/large, I got the long-sleeved pink dress in XL. It fit great. The only objections from my behalf is how I struggled removing the shirt[due to the stiff material], how the skirt rode up very easily as I walked, and how the skirt rests above my hips[due to the small size not fitting my hips.] Since the skirt sits on top of my hips, it makes the skirt shorter, thus exposing more than I had anticipated. I wear it with opaque stockings and/or a petticoat so it doesn't expose as much as it would without those things.<br />Overall, I love the item, I would purchase from this seller again."
4.0,Love this night gown but it‚Äôs too short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù my rear end keeps hanging out
4.0,"My son looked great, I bought this for his 1rst Communion.  He is 4'11 and 80lbs so he has a slim build.  The size 12 fit him perfect."
4.0,"not as great the the original, but never the less, cheap option for heavy gamers"
4.0,"Gift, looks good"
4.0,the fit is not as great as other styles I have worn
4.0,The dress lots awesome on first wear but the golden print is very cheap it‚Äôs starts fading just with the wear and after 2-3 wash the golden print fades like it‚Äôs too old. So it‚Äôs good for a small function for one time wear
4.0,"It looks so beautiful, I recommend it for others to buy."
4.0,"the elastic waist didn't give at all.  fitted to tight, returned it.  it is a beautiful skirt."
4.0,"Great compression shorts, good fit for the lady trainer. :)"
4.0,"Great dress. Ordered a M and I'm 168lbs, 5'3&#34; 36D-DD. it's just a tad short and tight. Will be swapping for a large. Otherwise no issues."
4.0,Its super cute shirt! I love it the only thing I thought was weird was that the sleeves are sewn odd.
4.0,"I like how comfortable and flowy romper is, however it does run large. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and crotch is halfway to my knees. Be aware fabric is thin and see through."
4.0,"Purchased for a 5'9"" thin teenage boy. Nice shirt but too big."
4.0,"I have a few young cousins who needed some swimming goggles for the pool. I asked them to wear them in the pool and tell me what they thought. Overall, my cousins liked the design of the goggles, they liked how they could see under water, but they did not like how tight they fit on their face. One of them, whom is four, said it fit perfectly while the other children, only a year or two older said it was too tight and they didn't want to wear them. That even when adjusted they didn't feel comfortable.<br /><br />I rated them a four stars instead of a three because my youngest cousin loves them and they do keep the water out of your eyes. It's not a five stars because my other cousins ultimately didn't enjoy using them.<br /><br />I would recommend these goggles to children under the age of five. They might be for children, but they are small, even for children goggles, and fit tightly. A little too tight. Might not be a good product for beginning swimmers.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Its honestly so cute. I love it for my diney bound. But be cautioned, it does come a bit banged up a bit but i think its because of the material. Its still really cute."
4.0,Love the fit and love the color.  Bought this for a wedding and will have not to worry about not fitting in with the rest of the party.
4.0,"Thanks to other reviewers, I knew to size up. I'm usually a small in pants, but the medium fits me pretty well. I probably could have gotten away with a small since these have a bit of stretch, but I don't like my pants to look like they're painted on. The quality is so-so (the fabric is thinner than expected and had a bunch of loose threads, but I wan't expecting top-notch pants for the price. The cargo pockets aren't too bulky and come in handy when you want to go without a purse, and they're pretty comfortable. The drawstring seems usually long, but I can easily fix that if I want to."
4.0,Fit pretty good didn't look what I thought it would look like on though
4.0,"Love it, but run small ((("
4.0,"Pretty cool ring, though I would go a size up."
4.0,Great way for my husband to advertise that he's a realtor.
4.0,"Very nice. I ordered one size; which was slightly too small. I liked it inspite of, so I kept it for someone who could better fit it and ordered myself another size up. Great fit. Only thing I'd change is the hood. The hood has a bib/Veil that is too stiff. May wear (soften)with time. Not a deal breaker though."
4.0,This has to be the most buttery soft fabric ever! These pajamas are so cozy and comfortable. I think the sheep pattern is really cute too and not overly childish like I was worried about. I will say I think this runs probably a half size larger than it says. It's also rather long in the legs and sleeves. I'm 5'6 and this does pull a bit around my ankles. But it's so comfortable and I don't mind that it's slightly oversized.
4.0,"I used this product for working out. What I liked about it is the quality. What I didn‚Äôt like about is the round shape of the sponge in the breast area. It should have been in the shape of the triangle like the bra. It was a little hard to get out on at first, and around the side of the breast area should have been a little higher. I don‚Äôt feel like it should be as low. Doesn‚Äôt support that side.  All in all for the price, not a bad product."
4.0,It is okay but the fabric is not soft and the garment is shapeless. The zipper is hard to start. I miss my robe that was soft but hardy cotton and snapped up the front!
4.0,I love the mask because it has my baseball team on it and I received 3 different styles! But I didn‚Äôt like the flap that you have to roll up!
4.0,I like the dress and even though I got a size small dress it fit a little bit too big and I have an athletic build not a small one. But my boyfriend sure loved it!
4.0,"I bought 10mm(00g) and while the flare is a bit bigger than I‚Äôm used to, they‚Äôre perfect! These are comfortable, lightweight, and I don‚Äôt have a fear of them falling out!"
4.0,I did not read the Mid-calf description.  My fault.  It is truly mid calf length.  Too long for me.  I like my skirt to hit at or just about below the knee.  I sent it back but did order the same brand in a shorter version.  Fabric is very nice too.  I like that they have many colors and the bandage fabric does what you would expect it to do.
4.0,I love these pants and I love the way they look on me. If they're see through I haven't really noticed but I just match with pink panties anyways. My only complaint which is consistent among these in different colors is the waist. Its always too lose otherwise they fit great! My only other complaint is that the switching on these could also be reinforced.
4.0,The earrings are a very nice design. Still big in my book. Would not buy for girls. For adults they are perfect. Wear all day with no discomfort. Can be used for dressy times or casual. I like that.
4.0,As I expected very nice
4.0,"Las gafas son muy buenas, aguantaron todo el verano sin problemas!! Muy satisfecha con ellas, sin embargo los protectores para nariz se rompieron a la primera. Aun as√≠ me parece una muy buena compra!"
4.0,I really love these except the thread on the end has already began fraying. :(
4.0,"beautiful. I'm always getting compliments on this purse. It is a little bulkier than I imagined but I LOVE IT. fits everything I need and nothing more! the cell phone holder or whatever it is, is of no use to me though. could someone tell me what that thing is?!?! HAHA"
4.0,"I love the design. For the price it couldn‚Äôt be better. The bracelet is plated not solid, it‚Äôs already wearing to a secondary metal after a couple of weeks wearing it, which is why I‚Äôm deducting a star. Shipping was fast and I‚Äôm happy with my purchase."
4.0,beautiful dress for the price paid. it fit like a glove.
4.0,Great cool material.Feels great and fits great.
4.0,Fits ALL of my keys and does not feel bulky in my pocket!
4.0,"I bought these to wear to my brothers wedding. They were fabulous! I received many compliments on them. I found that they were neither too big nor too small, however they didn't show up real well in the pictures- but in person they were the right size. A great pro for these earrings is that they weren't heavy! I would definitely recommend these earring to anyone looking for a little sparkle!"
4.0,"I really like it because of the size. I love the color and it is very shining. Also, Great price. I would totally buy it again."
4.0,"Bought these as a costume addition, they fit perfectly & look realistic. Kids were even creeped out by them."
4.0,The end of the sleeves narrowed down and I'm unable to pull it up on my arms.
4.0,This bang for the buck
4.0,"I ordered half sleeve, but received long sleeve. I needed it quickly for Halloween, and it's not a disaster, but just be wary that you might get the wrong sleeve length."
4.0,Product as described.  Looks like it will stand up to my runs
4.0,A little snug. Well very snug. But perfect for layering.
4.0,"My wife loved the earrings, except one of the stones fell out the first day she wore a pair."
4.0,"These glasses come with a really nice semi hard zipper case and the lenses are polarized with a medium dark tint. Frame are fairly nice quality plastic and have rubber tips on the arms to keep them on your ears even if you are moving around a lot. The arms were a bit uncomfortable at first but I got used to them quickly and now I'm very happy with how they feel. There are 2 small screws in the bottom of the arms to tighten them up when they get loose.<br /><br />These glasses are large and should fit any adult head. On the inside of one arm it says ""design in Italy"". I really like the look of the lenses, they are just like the photo with pink in the middle and green on the outsides. The frame has a splatter paint design and it's a very 80's or early 90's look overall.<br /><br />Happy with the look, feel, and quality of these and I'm wearing these every day now that it's sunny outside again. Lots of compliments and comments on these glasses so far. They definitely make a statement."
4.0,I like the suit......came quickly....fit well except that the straps on one side kept falling off the shoulder as soon as I put it on.....I solved the problem by tying a ribbon of the same color as the trim between the straps on the back........the trim starts out as a flourescent pink but after a few sessions in the chlorine the pink turns to purple.......still pretty though.
4.0,Good quality. Very vibrant colors. My son loved it for Hawaiian day at school.
4.0,"The material is pretty comfortable, but in comparison to another branded slimming shirt of the same size, this one is noticeably looser. I think its fine though, since some days I don't want to wear one of the slimming shirts that I have to struggle to get on. The length of the shirt is a plus, longer than some others I've bought on Amazon and makes it easy to tuck into my pants to prevent it from riding up when I bend over or squat down."
4.0,I like it but I won't buy another Wallaroo.  I have both Peter Grimm and a Scala and they are both a sturdier hat with a better inside sweatband than the Wallaroo.  I'm not sure as to how this hat will hold up over time.  I did shape it for my head and took off the rather masculine brown band and replaced it with a chiffon scarf and flowers.
4.0,"it works, and if you‚Äôre shopping for Halloween, highly recommended. This product shouldn‚Äôt be worn as a everyday accessory. It is not very durable, but will last you about a week. Other than that, it‚Äôs very tight on the fingers so keep that in mind :)"
4.0,"I bought these because the inserts that come in bras often fold and wrinkle after washing (I can't be bothered removing them before throwing them in the laundry!) I took off one star because after several washes, one of them is starting to pucker a bit."
4.0,"Wish I got the smaller size!  I repurched the small, fits much better!  I Now have three dresses!  Would buy again"
4.0,"Im a size 10 in women's and these fit but are slightly snug.  The rubber on the inside works very well. I like the variety of colors and this is one of the cheapest sets I have been able to find.  I constantly wear boat shoes, van type sneakers, moccasins and ballet flats, but hate the feeling of wearing no socks.  These are a great solution and feel even better than more expensive pairs I have gotten in stores.  The packaging was a little odd, they came with each pair wrapped around a cardboard foot, then all 10 were rubber banded together inside a dirty looking ziplock bag.  I washed before wearing so not a big issue, just thought id mention it!"
4.0,waist ran a little high on the cut of the dress for me.  had to send it back.
4.0,She looked great in it. She likes to wear two piece but doesn't want to expose to much skin because she is light complected. She can't wait to hit the beach it. The top came with bottoms and she did't expect that. Great bonus.
4.0,Works great! Thanks!
4.0,They are stretchy. And super long. I couldn‚Äôt wear heels at work. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 214lbs. I ordered an XL. Should‚Äôve purchased a L. Overall I love them!
4.0,Nice dress looks great one
4.0,"Functional band, shipped as stated.  Instructions for installation poorly written and require a magnifying glass to read even with 20/20.  Tool supplied to remove pins very cheap.  I removed two pins and watch it bend and flex under the stress.  Wouldn't expect it to work much past the first fitting.  The product is cheaply engineered and crafted.  It works and serves the purposed."
4.0,"This isn't super rugged or high quality, but it is a good light weight hat. It is perfect for my needs- wearing around the farm and  it's cute, too."
4.0,In the photo the shirt is longer. I know sizes can alter the fit slightly but not quite as much as I received. i would say sizing may run a bit small.
4.0,Loved them they are the perfect gift for my boyfriend. ... only thing  I didn't like is they didn't come in the box and I kinda wanted that
4.0,This top is soft and comfortable material. It fits flattering and is a cute top!
4.0,"Love these!  The only drawback is some of the fasteners came loose too easily making, making it likely the watch would be lost.  The style and the price are great though!!"
4.0,Great for our daughter‚Äôs 30th birthday event
4.0,"Fit nicely, good quality!"
4.0,"Nice fabric and style, sleeves are a bit tight but I think I can make it work."
4.0,"My wife wears the blue and I get the green. Since we only got 1rope instead of 2, my wife let me use it. Other than that, these sunglasses are great and we loved them."
4.0,The sweatshirt is so darn cute on her but I would say that it is a touch too small.  She is tiny so I ordered the size that I normally do for her and it is a little tight to get her arms in.  Cute sweatshirt once it is on.  I would order up a size since they grow so fast.
4.0,This was nice outfit it runs short more like Capri length. Overall it was a nice outfit and i recieved questions and compliment.
4.0,Just as pictured - nice cut and fabric.
4.0,I like it but it is not as fitted as I was expecting. Still a very beautiful dress.
4.0,"Great dress, nice quality.  Only 4 stars instead of 5 because the color did not match the photo. This dress is more of a light sky/aqua blue versus the deeper royal blue pictured."
4.0,"I am a 34x30 and the L fit me perfectly.  I like seeing the fact these pants have double stitching going up the leg, for anyone who actually works for a living do note that as it will come in handy.  There were a few too many lose strings from the pant that I had to trim though, for that I took off one star.  Fitment and feel were great of the pants though, they seem like they will breathe very well.  As far as how they hold up?  The material is thinner so as far as rugged jobs I wouldn't go for these.  For hot environment jobs where you are going sweat and need your clothes to work with you I would gladly reach for these.<br /><br />Bottom line I would buy them again at this price, very much like the way overpriced outdoor brands you see all over the place at a third the price."
4.0,Great item however the cases arrived broken. It didn't damage the product though.
4.0,"I got these to add to key chains I was making. They are cute, as described"
4.0,"Perfect fit, nice design and good quality."
4.0,"this is a very good dress , I like it"
4.0,For the price I should give it 5 stars. This is a nice looking everyday watch and a hell of a deal for the money.
4.0,I like this but the beads are big
4.0,"After purchasing this product it arrived to my house extremely fast and in great condition. The product as well as the packaging came in excellent condition, neither had damages or tampering done to either one.<br /><br />First impression: The product came in a clear plastic bag with a sticky end that allowed easy access to the product. The product comes in a long, beautifully handmade wrap around bracelet. It's crafted with little black beads along with a clear bead every 6 black beads. One end has a metal piece with two holes as the other end has two pieces of twine like material where you thread it through the other piece to tie.<br /><br />First impression on using the product. The product was very easy to wrap around my wrist and tie. It's not your average jewelry and the fact that it's handmade makes it unique. It doesn't feel flimsy or like it will fall apart. It is very well made especially with the material used and stitching that if you look closely you can see goes through each bead and around the twine like material.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I really enjoy this product. I'm not a flashy gal so this type of jewelry suits me very well. It isn't irritating to the skin and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it asking who made it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I recieved this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange giving an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Looks decent for the price
4.0,Beautiful piece. It's well made and looks great with all my outfits.
4.0,Simple but cute dress. Bought it for my daughter's eighth grade graduation. It's a tad bit short in the front but she loves the back! I initially purchased a medium and exchanged it for a large. She is 145 lbs and 5'9...
4.0,"Corre demasiado peque√±a,  aconseja seleccionar un n√∫mero m√°s"
4.0,"I like this a lot. I got it for a vacation to Sanibel. I burn easily and wanted a white cover-up for a little added protection. I looked several places but all the white cover-ups were crochet or mesh and I wanted something a little more solid. It has the little eyelet design down the front, but it isn't a big one, so it was a great choice. It's flowy and comfortable and covers well."
4.0,Good item but too big and does not have smaller sizes
4.0,"You can see through the white top much more than expected.  The fabric doesn't seem that thin, but evidently it is.  Feels nice to wear."
4.0,Looks very pretty!!!
4.0,"So I actually really like this dress, but it isn't what it looks like. The picture makes it seem more like an a line dress, but the skirt is pretty straight. Also the pockets are weirdly high.<br />That said, I got it as a ""throw on and go"" dress and it's pretty perfect for that. It's comfortable, not unflattering, and has pickets."
4.0,"This shirt is well made, nice fabric that doesn‚Äôt fade and isn‚Äôt too thick. I like the boxy look sometimes and it definitely delivers. It‚Äôs kind of short but I got a L bc I wanted it roomy. Im usually a M or L and I have a longer torso, so if you don‚Äôt it won‚Äôt be as cropped on you. Im ordering more"
4.0,"Got this in XL for my wife, her normal size. It was little small but nonetheless it looks good on her. One size up would have been perfect."
4.0,"I bought this item slightly bigger than I normally wear. The suit fits perfect and is very cute. I have received many compliments on it,"
4.0,"It is flowy, The material is soft, middle of the road  quality  but nice for the price. Fits true to size. I wear XS I M 5‚Äô3‚Äù 120 pounds. Fit well. May wrinkle easy but will work well for the 4th of July!"
4.0,"I am very happy with this purchase, earrings are as described have a good feel and nice sparkle. I recommend them!"
4.0,"material kind of thinner than i wanted, but i still love the top."
4.0,Perfect for the summer. Will definitely replace yearly.
4.0,It look good and I like it
4.0,"Review for: YEEPSYS Women's Pants Bubble Hip Butt Lifting Anti Cellulite Legging High Waist Workout Tummy Control Yoga Tights<br /><br />These pants are made of a ruched and stretchy fabric that I don‚Äôt really care for but they fit like they were made for me and they feel great. As far as the butt lifting feature, that part is certainly not happening but then I didn‚Äôt really expect it to. The tummy control part is a bit effective and works like most tummy control clothing, it is a bit tight around the belly. The length is good for me and I am 5‚Äô 6‚Äù.<br /><br />Anyone that can live with ruched fabric will probably like these. I will wear mine at home, with a long shirt."
4.0,"I was needing some sandals that were slip on, not in between the toes, that were comfy and had some support. These really do fit the bill. i got the black ones, and though i am not a fan of snake prints, i cannot really even tell when wearing. My only complaint is, they are on the slightly large side, i wear a US7, bought a 7, but these are about 1/4 to 1/2 size too big in length. Width wise they are great, the sole has a decent amount of support and feels great, i am just hoping they dont 'stretch' in length like some cheaper ones do LOL. But, i really feel next size down would be too small, so these will work for me."
4.0,"Perfect for high top shoes, they look great, other reviewers are right the material is harder than normal laces so its best to double tie."
4.0,I ordered two sizes larger than I normally would and I still can't wear the jacket zipped up.  A great jacket for small people.
4.0,"This is a very comfy hoodie! I love how long it is. I got an XL and it is perfect, thick well-made material but loose enough to layer . I'm 5'6&#34; and 165 pounds. The drawstrings are shorter than they look in the photo however. And while the hoodie is 100% cotton there is a soft velveteen lining inside that isn't cotton. I like the no pocket look so it's flat where hoodies with pockets tend to bulge out right where you don't need it. The little zipper on the side is a cute accent and it's functional if you need to open up around the leg area. The sleeves aren't the type where you can pull them mid-way over your hand, it stops right at the wrist. So if you raise your arm up like this, this is where the sleeve stops. Overall for me it's a keeper. I'm wearing it right now. I could live in this hoodie."
4.0,"For the most part, this fits as expected.  After a few hours, it got a little tight under the girls, but I have had worse wears. The biggest problem is I wear this type of product to get a break from that kind of thing.  It is a little less useful when it starts to feel like a strapless push-up bra. Maybe once I wear it for a bit and it gets more lived in it will feel okay.  For comparison, I typically wear a 42C from Torrid."
4.0,This dress is a bit short im 5ft and i barely dare wear it as a dress if your taller it might be more of a shirt.
4.0,Great themed glasses for the 4th of July or a 'Merica party!
4.0,Great product for the price point!
4.0,"Having a tough time getting these fitted so they'll sit right, but they're very pretty."
4.0,It was cute to small for me but if it fit the way I expected it would have been super cute
4.0,"My boyfriend loved it, you just need to tie it yourself which can be a little tricky but it's so beautiful and went amazing with my prom dress."
4.0,"This watch is super cute and doesn't appear inexpensive. It has a pretty, large face and a seemingly well-made band. It goes with just about everything. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the band is quite large for me. I have it on the smallest hole and I can still slip my fingers in. Granted, I have small wrists. But still, what's a couple more holes?!"
4.0,"My wife selected this dress and these are her thoughts:<br />This is a versatile dress that can be worn on many occasions. It's pretty enough to be dressed up and soft and casual enough to wear on a weekday. I also selected this dress in black and it can really be dressed up in that color. I typically don't care for wrap v-necks, but this one is comfortable and modest. It stays in place well. It hits just below the knee on me, I'm 5'5"". Best of all, it has pockets. Recommended."
4.0,"This hat is great, fits nicely, and keeps the sun and sweat out of my eyes! The brim seems to fit much lower than the next size down, but that doesn't really detract too much."
4.0,"I love the hat, very cute, the choker is meant for a child‚Äôs neck. However I bought it for the to add to my costume and am quite happy with it. Arrived fast during pandemic!"
4.0,"Really pretty and way better quality than you would find at a 99 cent store and a party city. It's really great for a halloween costume, but don't try to use this at a prom. FAST SHIPPING. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Cute Dress for 8 year old
4.0,"I am very happy with my purchase. Outside of the white band having red dye on it ( in which I'm assuming happened because of the bands rubbing together in transit) everything else was good. For the price, you can't beat it. I received it in 3 days with every piece accounted for. It takes some time to change them out but the fact that it fits so snugly, I dnt fear the gearS will fall out. Great buy! I highly recommend these."
4.0,"Very cute suit!!! I wish the straps were a little more supportive, they are pretty thin and after wearing all day it felt like the straps were digging into my skin"
4.0,"Former US Navy enlisted man with 1 year old pierced ear (lol). Really enjoy these. I like the size of them. They don't quite cover the lobe, which I appreciate. Backing is screw-on with gasket around it to aid in gripping when removing. Only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that, when you forget to remove before showering and the backing gets wet, it can be somewhat difficult to grip when removing. Therefore, if you have a better memory than I and remember to remove before shower, they should be 5 star especially considering the price."
4.0,"I wasn't sure if this workout outfit was going to be more like a sweat pants outfit with fleece on the inside or just a knit. It turns out its a single knit (or maybe its a thin double knit), so it won't keep you warm in the winter. Its nice as a single knit, though. The stitching and the ribbing is sewn-in well, without loose threads, and the fabric is soft and comfortable. It is on the thin side and drapes loosely - very much leisure or sports wear.<br /><br />I got the navy blue-5 color and I wouldn't call this navy.  Its really purple with a tinge of dark periwinkle.  When I read the label, it states, ""PROFESSIONALLY DRY CLEAN"" - and it also says wash separately. I was concerned about it whether it is color-stable.  Why on earth would I want to send gym/lounge wear to the dry cleaners?  Putting that on the lable could signal one of two things - 1) its not color-fast, 2) it will shrink.  So I put it to the test.  I plopped it into a bucket of warm water and soaked it overnight.  It was perfectly color-fast - there was no die run off or bleeding.  After washing on the knit cycle, I air-dried it rather than put it in the dryer (just to make sure the dryer wouldn't shrink it).  It did not shrink from going through the wash, and it looked just fine after washing, no stretching out, no piles, no problems. It looked just the same as before the washing. So I'm not sure why they recommend dry cleaning, since the wash didn't hurt the fabric any.<br /><br />Now, about the size chart -- the size chart in the description is just way off.  The measurements on it seem scrambled senseless and don't relate to any consistent US size. A typical large size men's chest size is 42 inches, not 47 as is written in the size chart. Normally , extra-large is 44-46,"" not 49.21. Not knowing what to go by, I went ahead and ordered the usual size I order and it turned out to be the right size.  So I feel I can honestly say the sizes are true to size and to compare your measurements with the size chart in the description above only if you want some amusement."
4.0,"I was very excited for these to arrive, and when they did I couldn't wait to try them on. First off, the box packaging these sunglasses came in are beautiful with a black tan and rose gold color scheme. Second, these glasses come with a very attractive black leather (or more likely faux leather) case, a cleaning cloth, and a little tool for fixing your glasses that comes on a convenient keychain. Now on to the actual glasses. They are super cute and for the most part everything I was looking for. I do have a few cons: these glasses are not as weighted as I'd hoped, meaning they feel a bit flimsy. If you were to skip using the case and just threw them in your purse, they might end up broken and/or scratched. Next, the lenses are not as reflective/mirrored/opaque and they appear in the photographs. In person, you can still see my eyes through the lenses which is a bit annoying. Overall I'm pretty happy with these sunglasses so far. The cons aren't a huge deal breaker for me especially if you take care to keep them protected in the case."
4.0,"These replacement straps are identical to my old worn out ones. Now, holy cow were they hard to put in and I think that I am good at that sort of thing!  May be the installation tools that are offered would have helped."
4.0,I love the color and style but it was way too big.  I asked for an exchange and they instead refunded my payment and said not to return it.  I may order a smaller size as it is a really pretty top.
4.0,"Fits close, but shrinks in the wash, so I would buy a size larger.  Very comfortable, but now the shorts are too short."
4.0,"Got a large and it's a bit bagg and a bit taller than I expected, but I like it a lot. When it first arrives, it's so good and soft. After I washed it, this thing pills like no other. My black hoodie looks like a map of the stars now, it's pretty brutalized."
4.0,Easy fit comfortable material design easy on the eye.
4.0,Love the colors. Easy to use however I wish they were just a bit larger as others have said.
4.0,Very warm durable jacket.
4.0,Comfortable and great on the boat
4.0,"These are gorgeous. I wish I could give them five stars, but after one day of wearing them, the shoes began peeling and the sparkles came off. Still, seeing the joy on my little girls‚Äô faces was worth the buy!"
4.0,"I bought numerous bags for work before this one and this one works perfect for my needs. I wanted a sturdy bag that wasn't heavy since I have neck and back problems and this is perfect. it has enough room to carry books and coloring books without them getting bent or damaged. also many different sized pockets so there's places to keep all the things you need and want to carry.  Another plus is its stayed in one piece, no rips, loose strings, and the zippers are sturdy. Highly recommended!"
4.0,"Very decorative,  clamp bracelet style is awkward on the wrist, heavy too."
4.0,These ears and tail are great - made well and fits an adult head perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,The product looks great and shipped quicker than I had expected it to.
4.0,It appears as a mustard color and is a very bright orange completely different look
4.0,"Don;'t really like hats...smush my hair...don't usually fit my oversized female head. this hat, however, fits well and looks fine. I really like having a cord for windy days at the beach or hiking.  Need to protect my face and hair from the sun, so I am glad I finally found a hat that comfortably fits my head and does the job it's meant for...however, really not fashionable or &#34;cute&#34;, just protection."
4.0,"These were for my husband, he just loved the fit and functionality"
4.0,"I really hoped I'd love this. It is good, and looks way better than you would expect with all those pockets. The pockets are all designed for specific purposes, and don't really lend themselves to different uses. I have an older iPad which was too heavy for comfort in the pocket dedicated to tablets. The other side did not have a pocket big enough for a counterweight, so I felt lopsided. The map pocket in the back is a little inconvenient. I did not find the elastic water bottle holder to be very useful. Still, it allows you to carry things discreetly and securely. I think I could have done with fewer pockets."
4.0,Nice colors can't wait to wear it
4.0,"The best thing about them was having something on the bottom of my feet when I‚Äôm walking around.  Now the soles of my feet don‚Äôt get scratched by stones, glass, or mechanical detritus."
4.0,"I love, love, loved this top.  I'm usually a Medium, so I ordered an XL, fit great! Looks great under a sweater.  Just washed it in my washer and pulled it out to line dry and almost all the seems had ripped!  :(. Not all together unexpected for an inexpensive blouse after almost a year of wearing & washing... Just dissappointing. 4 out 5 for seam failure! Lol"
4.0,"The top is not a crop top. I was expecting it to be shorter than it was and I‚Äôm basically swimming in the top which I don‚Äôt mind necessarily with a sleep top. The shorts fit well, no issues with the elastic. THE FABRIC IS SEE THROUGH"
4.0,Comfy top. Great casual look with jeans . However a little smaller than expected.
4.0,This was for a Halloween costume and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit. Well-made and the lace-up back should work for most figures. Would recommend!
4.0,Skirt is super thin but flexible. Nice fit and definitely will show your curves. Not Wearing undies is a suggestion or a longline undergarment so the panty line won't show. You get what you pay for.
4.0,"I love the color, I love the style, and it feels warm.  So I will have to wait for cold weather to wear this.  However, it comes to right below my butt and will need to wear tights or shorts.  I was expecting this to be more of a dress, but it is more like a sweater top on me.  I am 5'1 with 44DD bust. I am working my way to fitting it best.  I kept it because I can't beat the price and I love the style.  I will have to brooch it when I wear it though, I would totally be doing a JLO -Versace kinda thing if you know what I mean."
4.0,"Great quality, very soft.<br />Only returned because was too big"
4.0,really liked kaftan just  too  large
4.0,These are really comfortable pants that are very well made. The fit is true to size and the pockets are perfect for holding my phone or any accessories I need. My only complaint is that they don‚Äôt stay put. They tend to slide down and have to be adjusted a little too often.
4.0,"Love it! It's huge, great price too"
4.0,"So incredibly comfortable. I'm a 36G so I assumed I would need an extra large but it's way way too big in the cup, I'm falling out of it! Going to attempt to hem it. Will buy from again because it's so comfortable but will buy a smaller size for sure."
4.0,Pretty cute!! Love how it has snaps to make changing out the swim diaper simple. Runs a bit larger but my kids are also smaller built so that could be it as well :)
4.0,So far so good.  The fit is good and the quality seems to be very good too - time will tell.  The larger band around the waist is good as it keeps them from sliding down.
4.0,"This dress is perfect but its too small for me. I‚Äôm typically a size medium but the XL would not zip up all the way. The length is perfect and appropriate enough to wear to the office although I‚Äôd feel more comfortable with a long cloak instead of the short one provided. The material is not cheap either and the apron is the best part of the costume, *pockets*!"
4.0,I bought a very similar helmet so I thought a review here would be helpful. Mine was shipped from China and arrived flattened. I had to take a hair dryer and heat the helm up to reform it to the correct shape. The visor was held in place with what looks like command strips and with the smashed helm I had to relocate all of this as well.<br /><br />After working to reform it and adjust the visor the helm looks pretty nice. There was an extra visor in the box with mine.<br /><br />I bought this for my son which will fit him well if you are buying this for cosplay this may not fit you well as this does not fit an adult well but just right for a kid. You can see my chin in the photo as it peaks from under the helm.
4.0,An elegant looking watch bought at a very fair price.
4.0,Coje bien la talla por que creeme que es mejor que sobre y ajustar que romper para entrar. La mascara se me descocio un lado namas sacandola del paquete pero nada que tres puntos no puedan areglar una boberia. Peso 130 lb y mido 5.1 entre sin problema pero para sacarlo sola no pude. No por fuerza si no por los musculos de la espalda al levantar los brazos. Ya con alguien que lo saque por tu y tu relajando los brazos sale como una media. Y como no estira NADA pos cada estiron es una costura en peligro. So si tienes mucho pecho o espalda ancha mejor coje M y ajuste al gusto ^///^
4.0,Bought for wrk. Can breathe easy.
4.0,these are not cute but they kept my hands warm when i braved a snow storm in iceland. nuff said.
4.0,The fabric feels great
4.0,fit nice.
4.0,"The Half Finger White Gloves were returned for a larger size. As of today, I haven't received them. I will send a review than.<br />Thank you.<br />Ann"
4.0,Fast shipping. Very cute and look just like photo. I bought these a gift for an anime lover so I can not vouch for the durability.
4.0,"These shoes are great for the price my son wore them all summer, they would not be good in snow or rain. He can just slip them on and they are very light and flexible for playing. The insole came out about a month in but it stayed in the shoe for the most part. For the price they were a great kid shoe, this is our second pair."
4.0,It's a cheap ring so what is there to say. Works as advertised. Fits....  have to take it off in the shower as it pulls my hair
4.0,"Well made, but I wear a size 11 and since they‚Äôre a one size fits all, they pull a little."
4.0,Very nice socks. I only gave 4 stars as they are a bit short in the leg
4.0,The chain look really fake and bulky . The Jordan hop is well made and has good weight to it .
4.0,Love the vibrant colors. They really POP!  just a little big but could shrink when I wash it
4.0,Still comfortable and I LOVE them!!! So cute!
4.0,"Cute, simple, and casual. Can't go wrong with a dress that has pockets."
4.0,"The band was as expected, solid links, I had one link removed for a proper fit. The only complaint I have is the edges of each link are rather sharp and to make the band perfect the manufacturer should have rounded the edges slightly"
4.0,Looks good.. same as in the picture.
4.0,Leather is nice and supple with good fit and finish.  The 20mm strap tapers to 16mm so you'll need a 16mm deployant clasp to pair with it if so desired.  Wore mine a few times and it's still intact and looks brand new.  Love the quick release mechanism!
4.0,Ordered all 4 colors in a medium for golf tournament. Runs a little short but perfect for what we needed
4.0,"I selected this long-sleeve sweatshirt as part of my Fall wardrobe. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, wear XL shirts and I find it to be a perfect fit! The fit drapes perfectly, the shape is flattering but, most importantly the color scheme is ideal for fall. I love the tie-dye print.<br /><br />It is bright and keeps me comfortable during the cooler fall outdoor nights."
4.0,No complaints Its just as the picture shows
4.0,"Very thin ,like gauze, pretty color but thin enough that you see through them. Fabric felt like cotton gauze. Perhaps I did not read it close enough in the description but it is THIN. And again the colors are pretty like the picture. I just cant give it an excellent rating due to the thinness. A Coupon Code was provided for my evaluation purposes and thereby providing a typical product example that you can expect. My opinion reflects all my own personal purchasing decision processes and reactions, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."
4.0,"Purchased the black with the embroidery down the front. I bought a large. I'm 5'6"". I've worn it at my highest weight, which was 210 lbs, and my lowest, 175lbs. My chest size is a ~38DD, and I wear between a 10-14 pants. It did shrink a bit lengthwise, but it's still hits my thigh at an appropriate length, although, I wouldn't bend over and touch my toes. I learned my lesson: cold water to wash and dry on very low heat for about 15 min to get the wrinkles and stiffness out then hang to dry for the remainder.  I love the pockets, and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Most people are very surprised I got it off of amazon because the embroidery is so well done. Will probably buy another in a different color."
4.0,It doesn‚Äôt hold on on mask it moves when you talk a lot . Wish had a better fit on the mask!
4.0,"Zipper seems cheap, difficult to pass waist seam."
4.0,"My 16 year old son picked this out to give to his girlfriend. I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised when it arrived. My son was also happy with it. The pendant came in a pretty embossed shiny silver foil covered cardboard box. No need to wrap the box if you don't want to. We just added a bow. The color of the pendant was a beautiful clear pink color. We know it was a charm but the extra length made it a nice necklace pendant as well, which is what my son wanted it for. We bought the ROLO1MM-18 Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1.5mm Rolo Sturdy Chain Necklace 18"" [ASIN: B001KEBOSW] to go with it. This was one of the most gorgeous chains I have ever seen and went beautifully with the pendant. We are very satisfied."
4.0,"This product did not relieve my headaches, I gave it to a friend.  I guess it works on certain kinds of headaches."
4.0,"For the price this is a great watch bracelet, though it was a pain in my --- to get this on my mdv 106. My recommendation is just keep trying! The curved end link had some damage(pictured) but was easily fixed. I do recommend this and the seller."
4.0,Hard to get out of the wrapper.
4.0,"Although this is sold as a kind of crop top, I purchased it to wear as a bra substitute after shoulder surgery, so I could avoid anything irritating that left shoulder. For that purpose I‚Äôm glad to have it, it works decently well, and I‚Äôll be wearing it for a while. There are a couple of negatives, however. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Great for use after shoulder surgery<br />-Cute design & print<br />-Looks just like how it is advertised<br />-Comfy<br />-No delivery problems<br />-Seller was extremely accommodating when I had to return one due to sizing issues. GREAT seller! That means a lot!<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Quite sheer, I would say not wearable unless as a bra or with a bra under it. I got the black & white dragon print, but you can see through even the black part, due to the sheerness of the top‚Äôs material.<br />-MUCH larger than expected. Im a full 38D, curvy, and ended up in M for that bra-like fit. Initially I had an XL and it was really huge. To wear as a top an L would be ok.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because of the great seller, cute design, and convenience of having this after shoulder surgery. 1 star deducted because of the sizing issue and sheerness."
4.0,Looks great on my body! Plenty of compliments...I actually work it with the tie in the front & I added a shirt. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the material is thin! Otherwise it's fine
4.0,"These are good, solid straps with descent fit & finish."
4.0,cool and sexy look we both like.
4.0,Little larger then I expected but still cute and I kept them.  I did not get to wear them yet as I wanted for Halloween and they didn't arrive until the day after.  Very pretty though.
4.0,"This is a great dress for the price. Material is on the thinner side so take extra care when selecting undergarments, but the color is pretty and the style is flattering. I turned around and bought it in another color. I‚Äôm a 12/14 and bought the XL, it‚Äôs very fitted but wouldn‚Äôt consider it too small."
4.0,"Really cute and comfortable,  I don't wear heels alot but the heels on this shoe are quite easy to walk in for long hours and the shoe fits comfortable once you get yourself the right size, I bought it half a size up from my usual size."
4.0,Well made with quality fabric. I have a 38C and I ordered a L and it fit perfectly . I may purchase another color. I am 4'11&#34; and the hemline hit eighth below my knee. The fabric wrinkles easily or else it would be 5 stars.
4.0,"Beautiful material, cut and workmanship, flattering. So elegant"
4.0,The grandson picked these so he could wear them at baseball practice and games without having to take them completely out.
4.0,"Very pretty brooch, but it is so dark blue that it almost looks black....Until I got it into bright light, I thought I was sent the wrong color...."
4.0,The top is a little to short for the zize 6 because my dauther is 1 year and half old and dosent fit the top the shorts are ok but the top is to small
4.0,"So cute! Pictures show the versatility.. I am 5'2, 125 lbs, with long legs, short torso for comparison... However, it's very thin. I live in Florida so perfect for our colder days. I wash on delicate cycle in a laundry bag separating it from the other items in the wash, after a few washes (hanging to dry, I do the same for all my delicates or ""hand wash only"" & never have issues) the quality seems to lessen. It is becoming loose a bit. Good for the price, but you get what you pay for in terms of how long it will last."
4.0,They are warm and I like the way you can tighten them around your wrist.  I would recommend these gloves.
4.0,Not what I expected. It fits big. The line inside is not as thick as on the picture... AND took a month and the half to received it RIDICULOUS. Wouldn‚Äôt order it again
4.0,"These run a bit large, especially in the neck. I'm always disappointed at how wide open the necks of these types of shirts are, and that they don't get smaller with a smaller size. But the design and material are lovely and I really do like these shirts, once I found the correct size. Very comfortable, not too tight in bust or waist, which I've had some trouble with in some dri-equip type shirts."
4.0,"Beautiful watch, great package and protect."
4.0,I really like the cross except that it does not have anything or anyway to put it on my cell phone. its still pretty though.
4.0,Niceeeee
4.0,"TO BIG, BUT PRETTY !"
4.0,Love the idea of having no droop earrings however they are too big for my earlobes and backing shows!  Any other ideas?
4.0,Good product but it‚Äôs not all that. Just a regular step tracker
4.0,Definitely a smaller sized bead than the other package of Tara brand beads I bought on amazon. These purple ones are harder to thread onto braids than the clearer beads. Nice variety of purple colors.
4.0,I love it but.... not as advertised. It has a printed cotton interior not solid nylon.
4.0,"Snug but comfortable, certainly eye catching."
4.0,I love them ..
4.0,"The packaging gets the highest marks. It comes in a nice box inside of a pink velvet bag. It's ready for gifting right out of the package. The necklace itself looks nice and it sits at a good length. The only issue I have is that the product description is right on; the necklace is ""Dainty"". I'm not referring to the size of the charm, because that's actually a perfect size. The necklace feels like it's one small tug away from breaking. It doesn't feel cheap, but it does feel like it's kind of delicate."
4.0,Works great for running in a bass boat in cold weather.
4.0,"This is a really classic necklace.  The chain is thick and well made.  The stone is a deep amber color and a little on the smaller side.  But for a really simple piece it is well done.<br /><br />My only issue is the clasp in the back is the open infinity design or sideways S hook.  These are not my favorite, my hair tends to get knotted around these easily and I have lost a few since they don't fully clasp closed. Otherwise the chain is a great length and looks good.<br /><br />I didn't get tarnish marks on my neck from wearing.  Price point seems a little high."
4.0,Would have liked the
4.0,These earrings are seriously huge. Great bang for buck.
4.0,"This is a very comfortable, supportive bra, and it fits well.  It is not &#34;no-bounce,&#34; however.  It's fine for medium-impact activities."
4.0,"This dress was affordable is perfect for South Carolina summer weather!  Well made - and very comfortable.  Other than being made in China [what isn't these days], I would buy it again."
4.0,"Very good TED/ Compression Hose, I wear them to work"
4.0,whatever
4.0,"Super soft and super flattering for my curves! Was nervous they would bunch in my hips, but no!"
4.0,They are great quality for the price. I wish they extended a little farther out.
4.0,Exactly what I was expecting...
4.0,"The little bag part got really annoying, it wouldn't stay straight and kept turning over! other than that it was great and warm!"
4.0,"This jacket is a very pretty red and the fit is a little strange. It fits good in the body, but, somewhat tight in the arms. I am keeping it because it is a thin wool and I will wear it with light underclothes.It did come VERY wrinkled. I washed it in cold water per the instructions, but that did  not help those deep wrinkles much. So, I got out my steamer ans worked on it and that did it! In the end a nice light wool jacket for the money!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs buttery soft and great quality but it fits more wide. I was hoping for a slim fit but around the waist, it doesn‚Äôt fit that well. It‚Äôs just a basic cami to wear with Jeans so it‚Äôll do!"
4.0,The questions asked in this survey seemed to be dealing with shoes...not sure why. These flip up sunglasses fit well on my prescription glasses and darken things the amount I like.
4.0,Not very thick material and runs a size smaller
4.0,it is very bulky when put in money and cards
4.0,"If the earring falls, the colored part comes off and can only be placed back by using a strong glue. Also, the gold part gets dark after a few wears."
4.0,Good quality and easy to carry
4.0,This dress was ok for me. The only problem is that it was too tall because my height is 5'2&#34;.
4.0,"I mainly bought this for my maternity clients, it helps to really create a nice waist line and show off the belly bump, this goes really good with a lot of my maternity gowns.  The design is beautiful and it looks very high end, it also photographs very well.  The ribbon in the back is very long, it can range from plus size to petite, all you have to do is trim the excess off or tuck it into a bow.  This is a very nice and elegant piece and would look beautiful also paired with a wedding gown.  It is a heavy though so you have to make sure it is completely tight and secure and that you have someone else to do that for you.

4.0,Nice athletic fit. 3 wash cycles and it still looks good.
4.0,If there were a little larger it would be great.
4.0,Really love it...
4.0,These are perfect to wear while working on the ambulance. I dont worry about damage or loosing my real set.
4.0,I wanted a tracksuit that was going to be long enough and not give me a flood pant look. This is very VERY long which I do love but also like will drag on the ground and be difficult to wear outside the house ever and I am 5‚Äô9. The material is thin but is soft. Also is more the velour that will attract every dog or cat hair you own.also the pants run slightly in the larger side so you could possibly get away with sizing down on that but the top is slightly tight and short in some places.
4.0,These were a bit narrow to get your foot in.
4.0,Cute. But too small....
4.0,"flattering, has some give"
4.0,"I took my cover-ups with me when I went to Disneyland and they worked perfectly. I wore them over my bathing suit, which allowed me to keep cool and when I went on the water rides, I dried off rather quickly."
4.0,Love love LOVE this dress! Fits beautifully and super comfy
4.0,"It was smaller than expected. I wanted to wear it as shown but it was too small to do that, but it works great as a kimono-style wrap top. I did have to safety pin it in a couple places because it gaps in the chest and stomach but if you wear a camisole under it, that may not be a problem for future wear."
4.0,Very cute dress and pretty color! Couldn‚Äôt ask more for the price.. but an opening for diaper change would be huge plus.
4.0,Comfortable and nice fitting
4.0,"too bad it didn't fit, I loved it, but gave it away."
4.0,"My wife got this to wear in the house. She really likes them but they do tend to roll down on the tummy part but other than that, great leggings!"
4.0,This is a very nice skirt. It fit well. There is an elastic band at the back which allows the waist to expand if you need more room. It is a long skirt. I'm 5&#34;4'. and it's about 2.5 inches above my ankles. I thought it be just past my knees. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0,"I bought 2 of these dresses and love them both. Arrived packaged neatly. Beautiful colors. The only thing I don‚Äôt love is that the top portion of the dresses I bought are alittle see through, nothing a tank top can‚Äôt fix of course. I bought the dresses with the solid color up top and the floral print on the bottom. Overall very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"The cardigan came in a bag that had the air sealed out. When I opened it, it had a weird chemical like smell. It was also very wrinkly from being in the bag. The material felt scratchy and the length was long for my body, or how I had imagined it to be. I returned it because it wasn't what I had expected."
4.0,A bit smaller then I was expecting but the pendant seems well made. The chain on the other hand seems flimsy and weak. I'm sure I'll need to replace it.
4.0,"Cool product but it stretches out a little bit. I love the idea of it though, and the bracelet is pretty!"
4.0,"Over all, it's a nice shirt - if it fits properly.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-The back and collar just sat really weirdly on me.  The shoulder seams fell at the proper place, but the cut of the shirt made it so that the collar didn't sit against my back and neck but rather gapped out.  Not sure why this happened, as it isn't a problem with my Duluth flannels.<br /><br />- it is made in China, although it has some ad copy and tag notes about being an &#34;American brand.&#34;  For the price I think they could afford to pay fair wages to American workers.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The flannel is beautiful.  It's thick and soft, has a good weight to it.<br /><br />- Stitching is clean.  Although it doesn't have any gussets or other convenience features, it's well put together.<br /><br />- Color and print also quite gorgeous."
4.0,"Lovely ring,  A little bulkier than I anticipated, so I'm wearing it on a different finger than I had planned,  Good quality for the price!"
4.0,Great for breastfeeding! Only complaint is the sleeves hit right at my elbow instead of below so it feels a little tight when I bend my arms but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 so that could be the issue with fit for me
4.0,Beautiful jewelry!
4.0,"Comfy. If we‚Äôre being real, a little tight on a bigger girl but still very cute!"
4.0,This was somewhat too large on the bottom and the top fit a little loose around the stomach. I bought it for my mother she loves it and the floral pattern. The bottom could've been a little more snug. She wears an XL top and size 10/12 pants; we bought 2xl.
4.0,"A m√≠ hija le encanto, la calidad es muy buea, es sumergible al agua la correa es como e cuerina pero de buena calidad. Me gusto as√≠ que lo recomiendo"
4.0,I was hoping the chain was thicker in size. I do like it.
4.0,Lovely garment but sized too small. My Daughter loved it and she has it would use a different  size chart.....
4.0,I loved these boots.  They are just a little to tight. But I don't regret the purchase.
4.0,They‚Äôre a tiny bit small but nicely made and work perfect for my new lounging shorts.
4.0,If they both were exactly the same that would be perfect
4.0,"Super basic, certainly nothing fancy but great coverup, not see through at all which is what I was looking for"
4.0,"So cute, but really ling"
4.0,You will not get the same box as when you buy on the Pandora store. but the product is Pandora original.
4.0,really loved the dress but the sizes are all wrong
4.0,"Looks very nice, but had to return as its way too big for my daughter who's 10. The hoops are very big"
4.0,"These fit smaller than my daughter's other size 40 frames, but I love the color choices and so does she! We exchanged for the 41s (no longer available now) and she loves them."
4.0,Got it for my son since he loves Fortnite and he liked them.
4.0,"On those frosty (25 degrees) mornings; they keep my hands toasty warm for the duration of the 30 minute dog walk. A slight bit bulky, but not bad at all, as I can still fit four fingers through the dog leash handle.  That's exactly what I was looking for.  The only drawback for me is the wrist area is super loose, not at all fitted."
4.0,Great grow room glasses
4.0,A little shorter than I would like. With that exception the shirt is a good quality and very cute.
4.0,My GF loves these socks
4.0,"This shirt fits true to size & is very soft. However, in the seller photos, the lightning bolt appears to be sequin but it is not. Got it for a good price so I decided to keep it."
4.0,"These are great warm comfy leggings, love the pockets. My one problem is they quickly start to pill and wear between the thighs. (If your thighs touch like a normal human woman.) they will probably wear through at that area eventually."
4.0,"Good quality but order your size. I read some of the reviews and most don't mention the size or how it fit. I usually wear a Large but from reading the review's I order a XL to be safe and it's big now. It's not flattering, makes me look fat and I paid about $40 plus shipping so not happy about it at all!! Good quality but ORDER YOUR SIZE!! I HOPE IT'LL SHRINK AND FIT WELL AFTER."
4.0,"Great boots, hard to ride in because of lip but with that said they are comfortable fit well and look very good."
4.0,"I like these and the bright colors are awesome. All they had in stock was XL, and I am a 36B, but I wanted them so I bought them anyway. They are not snug at all, but not all flapping around too big either. (which is better then being too snug like so many of them are). However I could have used a L instead. The straps kind of make a squeak noise which I don't like, but after a couple washings that has calmed down. Love to wear these under tank tops, very comfortable."
4.0,"This purse is cute but like other people have mentioned, it is very heavy.  The middle compartment also caused me to keep losing things within my purse.  I am a purse lover so these are all things I am used to struggling with but the weight of this purse is what caused me to stop carrying it.  I feel like I should explain what I mean about weight.  If you are just carrying this bag with a wallet and maybe a notebook or something inside you will most likely be fine.  However, if you are like me and you are carrying this bag and two other bags with a laptop and files, this purse is too much.  Also, if you are planning to carry books and a water bottle and your life in this purse, it might be too much as well."
4.0,The top has a neckline that's lower than practical for the teens and single digits but the bottom is very warm and does the trick without being seen under outerwear. Comfortable and the price is very all right!
4.0,I like it; however the angel quickly falls off the clip.  We live in Florida and it is extremely HOT.
4.0,Look very elegant
4.0,I don't like the fabric that much. The price of the dress should be lower because of the quality of the fabric.
4.0,"Runs a bit small. I wear a US size 14/16 (actually 16/18) and despite ordering a XXL size, this dress just fits without a lot of room. Apart from the slightly off sizing, I love the design, texture, and style.<br /><br />I will wear it to work on one of these days."
4.0,Washed it one time and it looked old. J
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because it is a very nice swimsuit overall. I wish it would have fit me but unfortunately it was a a bit too small. I am a 34DD and the top was way too small for me... I had to return it due to size but the bathing suit is very nice! I might re-order in a larger size to give it a try once again...
4.0,Just a little larger then expected but great quality for price!!
4.0,I think it‚Äôs a little thin for what you‚Äôre calling a sweatshirt but I do like it.  I love the colors overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase!
4.0,Very comfy and doesn't slip off. Just bought a 2nd.
4.0,"Cute and sexy without appearing that I'm trying too hard, if that makes sense.  Wish they had other colors in this style."
4.0,"Bought for my mother to where when she had difficulty dressing It was soft and kept her just warm enough, without being too warm. Arms are shorter than some so they don't get in the way."
4.0,"It worked well for the trip I purchased it for. Maybe be able to pack for 4 days, anything more than that you‚Äôll probably need another bag. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11 and packed full, the bag gets quite heavy.  I liked that it had an area to slide onto a rolling suitcase handle."
4.0,"So I ordered these in a M but received L. However, the large fit me perfectly. And in normal (non e-com stores) I'm a S 4/6. I usually order up a size to compensate for Asian sizing. But considering that the L fit like a real US S, I'd say order up 2 sizes to get your true size."
4.0,"Nice colors, they fabric is a little rough bit is ok"
4.0,Really well built.
4.0,The dress is beautiful but the fit not so great. It fit her in the hip area like it was supposed to but the bust area was larger than the sizing chart. I had to alter due to prom and time restrictions.
4.0,"Wearable, but not perfect . Had to order a size and I  could have add a bigger cup."
4.0,Love the watch only thing that gets annoying is the part the unlocks the watch from your wrist is really sensitive almost every time I bend my wrist it unlatches the watch other than that the watch is great.
4.0,"Very pretty belly rings. The sort of iridescent jewel part is plastic though. It also came a little darker gold, close to a rosey gold!"
4.0,"As someone who absolutely loves to accessorize this necklace really completes an ensemble. The necklace looks great on and I get compliments all of the time. The only downside is the drape of the necklace. I thought that the top layer might drape higher than the other but it hangs almost right on top of the bottom layer which annoyed me a little at first because I felt the need to adjust it constantly, but once I got busy I forgot all about adjusting it and still got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,Comfortable shirt!
4.0,It does not have the best quality
4.0,I agree with the other reviews. This is not a compression tank. The fabric is too stretchy for compression. I bought these to wear as a moisture wicking base layer for hiking trips. It's perfect for that! I'm a size 36D and I weigh 133 lbs and size medium fit me well.
4.0,"Very nice dress. Cut straight down the sides, so not too fitted. The black isn't see through, though it's thin so a lighter color might be. Overall worth the price."
4.0,"Love this pocketbook, it's the perfect size..."
4.0,The arms were real tight. Fit well everywhere else though
4.0,"They are awesome but they smudge easy, so make sure you have a micro cloth with you"
4.0,I was thinking it would be a more absorbent terry cloth but it's more of a cotton waffle texture which I kind of like better as it's light for Spring and Summer.
4.0,The bandanas  were a little different fabric than what I expected and the size was a little off but worked ok for the project I needed them for and the price was reasonable.  The free headband was a little small but I can't complain since it was free.
4.0,"Fits pretty good. Love the colors. I am 5'9&#34; tall so it's a little short in the stride, have to keep pulling it down."
4.0,We had dancers dressed as firefighters to fool restaurant guests into going outside for a capacity count to see a flash mob and these costumes fit the bill!  One guest even remarked that he thought they were the real fire dept.  Good value for decent quality.
4.0,"I had a size Medium and they were fine for the foot, but the calves they are very tight.  If you light a tight sock then you'd like these. I do like thick socks but these just are too tight for me. I do like the colors and they would make a good conversation piece!"
4.0,"The top is amazing. The bottoms....do not do me any justice. I am a size 00 and there is too much material in the crouch area. The song says it best ""I like big buts and I cannot lie."" Sadly for me, this bathing suit does not either and I could not wear it :( I gave it to a friend who looked STUNNING"
4.0,"This bag is big, fits all the essentials. Isn't as classy as a purse would be. But it works for a everyday bag! It's soft and holds a lot!"
4.0,"This makes at least one thing in your day carefree! Looks sharp if you fold it over the wraps easily.  Be careful with sweaters if you have to stretch all the way to your bicep, but that‚Äôs just common sense."
4.0,These hats are great for the OR I highly recommend them. I am sad though one of the elastics in mine unraveled and came loose.  I do think I can fix it.  They are lightweight which is great for working in high temp OR's.
4.0,"I love these! I had to modify them to where they could go in, because rhey wouldnt go in without the pain being too much. I cut off the back lip, and now they fit perfectly!  They almost don't fit, but if you lube them up, they go right in! I love the variety of colors you get for the price! It's totally worth it."
4.0,"While the fit is good my husband would have appreciated pockets that were larger, more like what you get on long overalls.  These are  struggle to get things in and out."
4.0,"It fits loosely, which I expected from the product description, but that's what I wanted in a summer dress.  Wore this on a cruise - it packed so easily and could be dressed up for dinner and evening entertainment, or worn over a swimsuit for casual days.  It is light-weight, but not see-through, so no slip is required. I got so many compliments on this dress.  Once I got back, I ordered another color also.  The only issue at all is that at my height (5' 5&#34;) it is floor length, even after machine washing and drying.  I've decided to cut off about 1 1/2 inches and hem it.  For the price, it's absolutely worth that bit of effort."
4.0,"I really love the dress it fits well and feels good, however one side of the heim is about 1 inch longer. It‚Äôs not bad but bugs me just knowing. Before I try to fix it myself, I am going to reorder the same dress in hopes another one might be perfect. I am planning to wear at our annual Christmas party. Fingers crossed another one works.And I can return the one I have."
4.0,"Gave 4 stars cause skirt was a little big, top fit perfect."
4.0,"I loved this dress but DONT WASH IT. dry clean only. It went from a medium to an xsmall. i'm 5'2 and it fell right at my feet, not below my ankles. I didnt think anything but sweaters in cartoon shrunk so much.<br /><br />I did but another one. Mt fav dress"
4.0,good looking watch but i don't know why the band came out.
4.0,"I love this suit for the price. I ordered a small and a medium. I tried the medium on first and it fit perfectly. The top is padded and they can be removed.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 112lbs. I won‚Äôt be wearing the bottoms, I prefer more coverage."
4.0,It looks quality
4.0,"VERY pretty, nice quality, BUT...the fur is a bit more on the orange side than looks natural. If it was just a bit less I‚Äôd be in love.<br /><br />Overall it is very nice, I appreciate that there is a slit on one side so you can tuck one end in the other to wear around your shoulders. This is a MUCH nicer option than another style that just has some elastic on the back sides."
4.0,This necklace is beautiful and rich looking. I got so many compliments. I am looking for it in  other colors.
4.0,Soft enough and fills the bill as I needed a white scarf and it is feminine with the lacy insert
4.0,Fits as expected and comfortable. A little bit stretchy. The color looks faded than the picture shown. The under arm is wide cut and might need to wear a similar underwear. Any I liked it
4.0,This runs a bit smaller than expected.
4.0,Shirt is nice quality but it ran small. Will be giving it to my daughter.
4.0,"I have one of their knit skorts which I purchased at Sam's several years ago. It is one of my &#34;go to&#34; items to wear during the summer. Love it so much; besides the fact that it's white, it washes great, never stains and is so comfortable. When I saw this I knew I had to have it. It's okay, the fabric is much thinner, quite a bit longer and fits so much different even though they are both the same size. I don't love it like the other one I have, but I kept it, something different to wear!"
4.0,"Arrived on time, in perfect condition. The only reason for one less star is for the retainers themselves, not due to the vendor. The rings on the end tend to fall off every so often, leading to my having to buy them in bulk because I go through them."
4.0,Looks nice but a little itchy
4.0,"I bought them as a gift for my teenage grandson, he love them."
4.0,"As expected, came quickly"
4.0,Great colors fits great. Arrived fast and would recommend.
4.0,nice shirt - order up a size
4.0,"I really liked the quality and the appearance of the dress. Unfortunately it is very fitted, and I did not get it customized (If I had, she would have refused any return). The dusty sage color is brighter than that from Azazie or JJs House. I bought this dress so I could see it in person as a trial and did not want it custom made, because I wanted to verify I liked the dress before having it custom made.<br /><br />Seeing it first is really not possible with this seller. The dresses may or may not ship from China, but she will tell you that you must return it to China at your own expense if you want to return the dress. After multiple days of communication, I finally was given a US address to ship to, but I still had to pay to return it. I'm now awaiting a refund for the purchase cost of the dress. We shall see if I actually get it."
4.0,"Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It's beautiful, and he's gotten a lot of compliments on it. Drawbacks are that the wood is soft so I've been hesitant to remove any of the links for fear of marring the wood. He's also had issues with having to reset the time and it's only been in use for a few months. Not sure if it is the battery or what, but it doesn't exactly run like clockwork (lol). Lastly, and some of the other posters have noted this, but the box it comes in is generic and not really a gift-box."
4.0,It is cute. But not as sturdy as I like.
4.0,Beautiful dress - a bit sheer but it was perfect for the event I needed it for
4.0,"The seller and I  have exchanged a few emails. I now know there are 2 switches. We thought the one we found was the only one.  The seller thanked me for letting them know there were no instructions in the box. They indicated that they accidently shipped several without including instructions and have remedied that.<br /><br />They have been very responsive and concerned. They have worked with me to help solve the problem.<br /><br />Amazon said they would send us a placement. We are waiting for that.<br /><br />Pro<br /><br />The scarf seems to be well-made. The material is soft. The scarf is comfortable. The battery is flat so it is barely noticeable when wearing the scarf.<br /><br />Con<br />Though the Shipping Box was in good condition and sealed, the red box inside was not sealed. There were a few indications that it had been opened before it was sent to us. The box contained the scarf, a battery, and a short ""D""-style USB cord for charging the battery. There were no instructions on how to use it.<br /><br />I fully charged the battery (based on instructions that have accompanied other devices I have).  After it indicated it had a full charge, I connected it to the scarf. (There is a small pouch zippered inside the scarf that held the battery. The pouch also contained an on/off button and a standard USB connector to which I attached the battery.)<br /><br />Later, my wife tried it but was not able to get it to work.  Independently, and at different times, we pressed the on/off switch and waited for 2 to 5 minutes.  When the scarf didn't get warm in that length of time, we pressed the on/off switch again to make sure we tested it when the switch was on and off.<br /><br />We were not successful in getting the scarf to warm. Perhaps, we were doing something incorrectly. Since no instruction were included, we didn't know. (I assumed others would encounter similar problems if the package they receive contains the scarf and battery but no instructions.<br /><br />Because of the seller's consciousness help, I changed my rating from a 2 to a 4. I will update it again if we get a replacement to test."
4.0,36g and the l gave me support. Had to remove to awkward paddings. I can run in these
4.0,Fits a little big but other wise no complaints
4.0,just arrived seems as pitcured
4.0,"I felt it looked a little flimsy, but my grand daughter loves it and it has held up well to the ""abuse"" of a rambunctious six year old. So overall I am happy with it and it really is beautiful to look at."
4.0,I liked it very much. I am usually a size 4 so even buying the small the cup was still a bit big but around the chest was fine as well as the bottom. Just so pleased to find bottoms that conceal more. Thanks!
4.0,"I have only had this for a week. It is very quiet and works as advertised. I have another winder and this one is much quieter. So far so good. For the price, it can't be beat."
4.0,Good Quality and I would recommend. Wood treatments are brighter reddish than in the pictures. Inside is well built and versatile.
4.0,"This is a well made and beautiful dress, but I could barely get in it.  I ordered an xxl and I usually wear a size 18.  The waist fit well (where it ended up) and the length is good, but I wear a 42 DD and the top is tiiiiight, lol.  The waist band is right under my bosom and the dress is more of an empire waist than a normal waist.  I'm wearing it to a Halloween party...gonna be June Carter Cash.  Guess I'll be a pregnant June Carter Cash, lol."
4.0,I am very pleased with this clutch.  It is roomy and seems to be decent quality.
4.0,"These a GREAT jammies! Nice and soft, well made... I bought them as a gift for someone who wears the exact same size clothing I do and they fit me but do not fit her. She is bigger aross the shoulders and chest, where I am very small in the chest and bigger in the tummy and hips area. The top is very snug on her shoulders and chest and pulls the buttons. My suggestion, if you're top (chest) heavy.... Order a size bigger. Unfortunately, these don't go any bigger than a SMALL 2x so I guess I'll keep these for me and order her a different brand."
4.0,"This fits well and looks realistic. The interchangeable gems are nice touch, but I personally feel they rub against the underside of my nose too much, so I leave them out."
4.0,"It is great for work, I wear it under a cardigan. It is super nice."
4.0,"it is good, material is not bad, be aware of the top part it might be slightly tight at the hips area, and it is sooo long it needs to be adjusted ( I am 158 cm so I am kinda short)"
4.0,have it in my car
4.0,"Used as a maternity dress for pictures. A little bit frumpy/shapeless but I really liked the color. I probably could have sized down. I bought an XL and was 34 weeks pregnant in the pictures, 5'11"" and around 215lbs at the time."
4.0,Wasn‚Äôt as long as I expected but still pretty.
4.0,Me agrad√≥ y me qued√≥ c√≥mo lo esperaba. La talla correcta
4.0,"while I understand that the ""one size fits all "" has to accommodate multiple sizes, this is a woman's outfit that could fit my husband who's almost twice my size (I'm 5'6"" & 140lbs) .  However, it's cute as all get out, very warm, and an easy outfit to accessorize with makeup or something of that nature."
4.0,Arrived on time. Fits as expected true to size and comfortable.
4.0,My daughter loves them!! Says they are beautiful and exactly what she was looking for- just don‚Äôt wear them for too long at a time because they are not that comfortable.
4.0,I'm a &#34;tall&#34; size 4. I'm 5'8&#34; and typically wear a small in tops and dresses. This tank fits small which my husband loves. Definitely plunges at the breastline- again my husband loves. I am small chested but may wear a cami underneath. I'm afraid to wash before the concert because it could be too small once it dries and there is little to no stretch to it. I love the length- hip length and super cute. Awesome overall tank. Just beware of the sizing!
4.0,"Love, love, love!! These earrings are beautiful!! They look super modern and sophisticated. Highly recommend!"
4.0,Is a bit billowy- but my main complaint is that is it too short for the intended purchase (as a work dress). I am larger chested so this may have something to do with it? It comes to mid thigh instead of just above the knee as shown in their pictures.
4.0,Very cute and would order again. Sizing is off and runs small
4.0,An oddly disappointing product considering the company. I‚Äôve bought three sets of teeth from them and this pair feels a little like a knock-off brand.<br />The molding and sealing still works perfectly - they‚Äôre just very chunky. Really thick in your mouth. I feel pretty ridiculous wearing them when I‚Äôm not purposefully showing my teeth for a shoot; they push my upper lip out and it shows. Super weird to talk with.<br />Color is starting to chip off.
4.0,"The top is super cute and doesn't cover all of my breast, however, the ruffling covers what the bra part of the top doesn't. The bottom fits good."
4.0,Nice . It is rather heavy. It is okay for occasional  wear
4.0,I love this blouse but small around the waist even the largest size available.
4.0,I like these glasses. They are cute and funky but can also look like protective glasses (they are huge) when wearing because they are so big on the face. If you want to be seen or stand out in a crowd and you have your hair and make up tight....these will give you a fly edge.
4.0,It was shorter than it appeared on the site. I had hoped it to be longer
4.0,"The color is very bright and fantastic.  It reminds me of candy.  I think this NATO strap is well made, but the material is very thick.  It may not fit on some watch cases due to it's thickness."
4.0,Its Perfect!
4.0,I kept them but they are a bit large.
4.0,I got this cap because I have curly hair and was hopeful that it would keep my hair curly and more healthy!  I like the results so far!
4.0,Attractive backpack with plenty of room. Lots of pockets to stay organized. My only wish is that the back was made of the same breathable fabric that lines the underside of the shoulder straps.
4.0,Dress seems great. It's too small but I kept it in case I loose a few pounds
4.0,flowy thin fabric. I use it as an underlayer for a dress with too many cut outs.
4.0,"These are almost cartoonishly flat. There is no curve to them at all, but they are all light weight and easy to wear. I think the tortoise shell pair is my favorite. The cream color pair has a lighter color lens so they're nice for overcast days. I'm not wild about the black pair they kind of look like the ones the eye Dr gives you when you've had your eyes dilated.<br /><br />Overall for the cost, get three pair of sunglasses is a good deal. Also, you won't be too upset if you break or loose a pair. (Which I frequently do.)"
4.0,"I have the black color. The listing pictures, at least on my computer, make it look almost charcoal. But in person it is indeed a true black. It is made of 67.5% viscose (rayon) 27.5% cotton and 5% spandex. The fabric is soft and smooth. Anytime you see fabric which is counting being made of bamboo, it‚Äôs actually rayon. Think of it this way‚Ä¶ Paper is made from trees, but it takes a lot of chemical processing to turn a tree into paper. The same applies with bamboo. It takes a lot of chemical processing to term bamboo into rayon. So it‚Äôs not really that ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù especially when compared to cotton.<br /><br />I have the size small. It measures 27 inches from the top to the bottom. It measures 19 inches across in the middle.<br /><br />This shirt washes well, but you need to hang it after drying. Otherwise it really wrinkles if you simply fold it.<br /><br />This shirt is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of nineteen bucks I‚Äôm sure it is twice the price it should be, but overall I like the shirt."
4.0,A nice looking dress watch that won't break the bank.
4.0,"I ordered the XL for a man who usually wears a Large Tall and the fit was perfect for him - sometimes the XLs are short and really wide, but this had great arm and torso length without a bunch of extra bulk in the chest.<br /><br />However, the picture makes this look like its light or medium grey, but it's actually a pretty dark grey/black heather.<br /><br />This was a replacement for an old all cotton hoodie that he had - while this one is warm and fits well, it is not all cotton and so it doesn't give a lot of give, especially in the cuffs. He'd like to push up the sleeves to his forearms when working with water so the hoodie doesn't get wet, but the cuffs don't give very easy so it was impossible for him to push them up and it gets wet, and then the hoodie isn't comfortable."
4.0,We received the wrong color but the size fit as expected.
4.0,"Nice  but runs too big<br />It's well made, fabric is good quality, not flimsy at all, and comfortable.<br />I recommend to size down"
4.0,This was a lot smaller than I expected but everyone always asks me where I got it :)
4.0,Great color and lightweight. Only 4 stars because they did not have the little plastic holders on the hook of the earring. Other than that great pair of really pretty earrings that go with so many things
4.0,"These swim shorts are nice, except they are about two inches shorter than what the photo indicates.  I do wish they were a bit longer.  Overall, they are good quality with nice soft material."
4.0,"Nice size and color. Three slots for cards, window for ID or transit cards. Middle pocket for cash or more cards."
4.0,"I love the color of the suit and the ruffles are a fun, nice touch.  The issues I had were that the bathing suit is not as high-cut in front as the picture looks and the straps are not sewn in the back, so they keep popping out.  I decided to keep the suit, but had a seamstress sew the straps down in back."
4.0,"Nice, seem durable looking forward to putting them to the test."
4.0,"I‚Äôm a big fan of cadet caps in general, and the Outdoor Research brand in particular. I‚Äôve owned a waterproof version of this hat for years that goes everywhere I travel. It‚Äôs a bit hot sometimes so I decided to pick up a non-waterproof version in a different color.<br /><br />The hat is lightweight and designed to fold in half and easily sit in your back pocket or a backpack when not in use. It has a lower profile that looks good on me, whereas baseball caps sometimes swallow my head and make me look 14.<br /><br />The only issue I had was sizing. My other O/R hat was a large, but this large was way too big. So back it went for a Medium, which is a bit tight but will stretch over time. O/R must have changed its sizing over the years, so check closely when you order.<br /><br />I paid $22 for this, and have noticed that the price fluctuates. So I‚Äôd suggest adding it to your cart and let Amazon tell you when the price drops."
4.0,This sweater is really cute.. the thin material makes it lay flat and the way the arms are constructed makes it easy to move. I like<br /> it!
4.0,This are no frills school shoes.  My daughters like them and says that they are comfy.  I've bought them shoes with ribbons or flowers in the past that just ends up falling off so this is perfect as the design is part of the shoe and not attached.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that I can see the material being scuffed if a kid gets crazy in the playground.  We've had shoes before that seems more rugged but this works for my kids as they are now older and are more careful with their things.
4.0,"Sizing was good, as expected"
4.0,Comfy.. feels good to wear.
4.0,"I bought these to wear with an 80s custome. They worked out great. Just as bright as I wanted then.  A little more tight than I expected but I did order my size Large, but it might not be a bad idea to order a size up. I would if I ordered another pair."
4.0,It does prevent your arms getting dark. Best fabric. Very sturdy. I wear them when driving. My left arm always exposed to the sun and I wear that to prevent sun taking over of my arm. Recommend to own one. Very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"This is a cute and roomy cardigan with pockets, but the product page didn't show that the soft beige hue I picked actually had a lot of color in it. I thought at most it would have brown threads throughout, but it has green, red, and yellow threads. It's not a deal breaker, but definitely unexpected."
4.0,The bras fit great. Love the colours.
4.0,Ok for a gift !
4.0,I only gave 4 stars because I haven't worn them yet but they are very nice looking & I plan on buying my daughter some!
4.0,"We like the shirt and it works. However, you can see through it. My fiance will be wearing a jacket so it's not going to be a problem. It buttons like a regular shirt; in the pic it doesn't look like that near the collar area. Maybe once we get it pressed it will have that look. Collar is the same."
4.0,"Decided to try these inserts in a pair of leather dress boots that are a 1/2 size too large for me. Unfortunately these insoles added too much height, making the tops of my feet rub uncomfortably against the top of the boot. I cut the insoles 3/4-length (removed the entire portion under the balls of my feet). This fixed the height problem, is still quite comfy, and my feet are nice and warm.<br />However, I noticed after a few wears that the insoles are starting to stretch the leather on the inside of the boot along the arch - they're just too wide for these boots. Looks like I'm going to have to remove them.<br /><br />tl;dr: warm and comfortable if you don't try to fit them into a narrow / fitted dress boot."
4.0,"Nice size heel.  Comfy except a little narrow around the toes.  If you normally wear a wide shoe, they may be a little snug.  Love the Velcro closure and shoe seems to be made well."
4.0,Very cool top! Stylish and looks exactly like the picture. Wish I had ordered one size up though. A little tight on my arms and I‚Äôm busty so the length isn‚Äôt quite as long as I would like because my chest size holds it up. If you are wear large I would order up a size. Same with x-large. I wear large and should‚Äôve ordered x-large. I‚Äôll definitely still wear it though.
4.0,"The ponchos were stronger than other ponchos I have tried.  I also liked the draw strings in the hood and sleeves.  But, my 10-year old son did manage to remove the draw string in the hood and one sleeve.  We were able to use the ponchos more than once, which was great since we had more rainy days than expected."
4.0,"Love the lenses.  Really brightens up and makes everything clear.  Not great for direct sun, but I am not having to squint.  Style is ok, but fit is a bit tight on sides."
4.0,Pretty but way too small. I ordered a L based on everyone's feedback and even at 5'5 and 150# it was still too small.
4.0,Very well made & stylish
4.0,I gave it 4/5 stars because the cost/performance ratio is high.  It give you similar results in terms of comfort and support like other name brand bib tights.  I would recommend this to anyone doesn‚Äôt want to pay too much for winter riding.
4.0,"some of the lights didn't work but given how cheep they were and how many I got, I really don't have much room to complain. I gave them out as gifts and people loved them. I just wish that they would make them better so all of them will work"
4.0,I was searching for a petite skirt as I am 5‚Äô0‚Äù and this came up in my search. Def. not short. But I am able to wear small heels and not needing to hem it. It will do as the material is comfortable but not exactly what I was hoping for.
4.0,"Nice quality feel, but too not close to an XXL.  I read the other reviews prior to purchasing this shirt (and another one from the same manufacturer) and some said it fit them as expected while others noted that it should be purchased one size larger.  I should state that I am 6'5&#34; and 250 pounds and not overweight - wearing a 36&#34; waist.  The shirt I received is labeled XXL but is really much closer to an XL.  I have two sons that wear XL's and it fits each of them perfectly.  I am keeping the shirts and gifting them to my sons (they love the shirts b/t/w).  The look and feel are excellent, and the photos on Amazon do not do justice to this shirt - it's much better looking in hand and being worn that it appears on-line.  I'm considering reordering this for myself but in a 3XL and see if that works."
4.0,Really soft and comfortable. Only negative was not having a fly.
4.0,Fits perfect and looks just like the picture. Only thing is it's a bit large on the top but still very pretty. Also shipping was fast.
4.0,"Good quality jacket! I posted a question about the sizing of the arms and I had reason to - when it arrived it was tight in the armpit/very top of the bicep area. Though it is labeled as a Men's size I think it still definitely falls somewhere in between Asian/European and US sizing. The lining, material, and colors were very accurate and beautiful. The length of the arms and the crispness of the lines were great. Overall if you can't afford to commission someone privately or get this done with your personal measurements, this is a decent jacket for cosplay purposes. But definitely runs a little small in the shoulders and tops of the arms."
4.0,"Pretty dress, lovely fabric, nice fit - if you're 5'9&#34; or shorter.  I'm 6' tall and the waistline is about 6&#34; too high, and not high enough to be an empire waistline.  Will still wear it around the house though.  Very comfortable."
4.0,Just as picture and the price ok
4.0,I liked the shoe but it was too small.
4.0,Not bad. Nose covers are not good
4.0,"As you can see it is adorable. I was fine with the material as well which is why it got 2 stars. Unfortunately, this is a 3/4 sleeve crop top, not a long sleeve batwing sweatshirt. I am only 5'3"" and it stopped at my belly button. Upon trying it on I discovered that this garment also had a hole in the sleeve. I was still considering keeping it until I saw the hole. Disappointed that I had to return this as it was quite cute.<br /><br />Edit: Milumia reached out to me and gave me a full refund for the garment. They were very polite and really went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. I will buy from them in the future considering how helpful they have been. Edited review to 4 stars because their interactions with me really made a disappointing situation much easier to handle."
4.0,Absolutely love this bag. Durable and still fashionable.
4.0,Small around bustline
4.0,"Absolutely love this bag!! It was my summer bag, just retired. I received so many compliments on it, and it's a great size. I like a pop of color in my summer bag and this was perfect. Good quality also-nice leather for a good price"
4.0,The order arrived in a very torn envelope and I was surprised that fortunately nothing as missing.<br />The socks are fine weave and the size is ok.
4.0,These actually look pretty good on. They are true to size.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is that the material is sort of rough feeling. Hopefully they soften up after washing.
4.0,"This dress is very nice- the fabric is heavy enough that it's not see- through, but light enough to be comfortable for Spring and Summer weather in Ohio.  It goes down to just above the knees on my 5'6"" daughter.  The diagonal drawstring at the front makes for an interesting detail, but if it's drawn too tightly it does make the hem hang unevenly.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for posting my honest review here via the Amazon Vine reviewer program. All statements and opinions expressed here are my own."
4.0,"Excellent product for the money. I‚Äôve only had them for 2-3 weeks but have worn them just about every day. They seem pretty solid and I have no worry about beating them up. The finish on the lenses looks top notch to me. Would be 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for some distortion about a quarter of the way in the lenses all the way around. Also, the logo etched into the lens could be a bit smaller."
4.0,"The shirt was very cute, but the shape seemed weird. Maybe it was just my body type."
4.0,This arrived quickly.  It fits well.  It does run a little smaller than the original fit bit charge 2 band.  About a half inch smaller but that is exactly what I wanted as the large fit bit band was a bit too big.  So this one is perfect.  The color is fantastic and I have had several people comment on how nice the grey looks.  I have been using it a couple of weeks and have had no negative issues with it.  It holds my fit bit securely and cleans up well (I am a avid gardener and have gotten it dirty).  I highly recommend and would buy it again.
4.0,Driving day time
4.0,She loved it!! I ordered a medium and it's pretty big - probably size down if you're buying for a woman or a guy wants a more fitted shirt. Quality is excellent and beautiful color as pictured.
4.0,it was good but it was a little tight but I can survive in it
4.0,Fit well. Sleeves are a little shirt though given I have long arms.
4.0,"I really like these slippers. I'm not able to wear them right now because the stitching that runs horizontally across my foot hurts . I have an infection which has been choking the circulation as it is. Hopefully, my foot will heal and I'll be able to wear them."
4.0,The color of the top does not match any of the color in the skirt
4.0,Order 1 to 2 sizes up for a good fit
4.0,"Only issue is that as easy to install new band, it also unclips if u stretch it too far"
4.0,"I like these earrings---they are just as advertised and have the 925 sterling mark. The size is nice---and they are extremely comfortable and quite lightweight.  The one thing I would have liked though, is for them to be a bit more heavy.  They appear to be the type of metal treatment that will eventually &#34;wear off.&#34; In the meantime, I enjoy wearing them and like the silver/gold look."
4.0,"Would give it 5 stars because they are rugged, but the threads are already coming off."
4.0,"This is soft yet feels a bit slick/smooth, almost like those sweat-wicking fabric. However, it's not a  hi-tech sweat-wicking fabric. The blue is vibrant, and the lightning bolt is more black than grey, though that may vary, as described in product description. The fabric is 60% cotton and 40% polyester.<br /><br />The fit isn't so boxy and loose like typical sweatshirts. However, the sleeves seem a bit too long.<br /><br />I like it! A nice cut and comfy to wear. Works for all genders."
4.0,"Other than that one issue, it's a lovely piece."
4.0,"Positives: I've wore this dress about 3 times now and I've been pleased each time. The color is beautiful and rich, the material is like fleece on the inside and polyester on the outside. Its a form fitting dress, can be dressed up or down. Fit me as expected. I'd say the size chart is correct. Dress is flattering, I want more colors! May I suggest a light grey? :)<br />Negatives: Had my nails painted white and this dress changed the color pink. Didnt notice how often my nails brush against my clothes. Also washed a white towel with the dress - my fault - and the towel turned slightly pink so careful with that.Also there is no back tag so you have to figure out on your own which side is the front."
4.0,"I like the jersey, but it seemed pretty tiny. I'm not a small girl (5'8&#34;, 145lbs), but I usually wear a medium. I chose a large in this - thinking I'd be safe. It fits ok and is usable, but I wish it were sized more like a large."
4.0,Not length on the picture but is cute.
4.0,Material a little rougher than expected but not too much.<br /><br />I would suggest buying one size up as after a while the mesh does leave a few temporary marks on skin.
4.0,"The pants were very nice but they fit super odd on my small short frame. I'm 5'0 and the XS did fit, but being high waisted it reached up to my boobs üòÖ. If you're on the taller side they'll fit beautifully."
4.0,"I initially thought it was going to be a burnt sienna color, it's more orange than anything.  I like the spaciousness of the bag."
4.0,"This hat is great. The fit is comfortable, covering the ears without riding up. The cuff helps block the wind, and the wool helps to keep my head dry without feeling over-heated. I have worn the hat in 30+ mph winds, wet rain/snow/sleet  conditions. It performed well in all of those conditions. Great hat for camping, hunting, skiing, or just around town."
4.0,The 16G 8mm was just the right size for my nose! I am very sensitive to metal allergies and I have had no problems with this jewelry.
4.0,"PROS: Soft material. Can't beat it for the price! Worth it.<br />CONS: Only downside is the color is a little faded.. only a bit, but not as vibrant as the photo."
4.0,Came exactly as advertised and work like they should. I‚Äôve had multiple of these glasses and sometimes they get this residue on them that makes them blurry and I can‚Äôt wash it of. They are a little overpriced being you can buy them in bulk from their website. Overall good product
4.0,"This is a very cute sandal. They seem to make a pedicure really pop. The insole is very comfortable and gentle to walk on. The only complaint I might have is that the strap between the toes seems a little far forward to stay on my feet easily when sitting, but that might be because I find them to be a little large for the size I usually order. I might try ordering a size smaller next time. The buckle on the strap adjusts to fit any width or height of  foot. Overall I would recommend this sandal."
4.0,I like this earrings however they are huge. Too huge to wear
4.0,"Great quality and holds lots of cards. I use one side for my frequently used credit cards and the other side for gift cards, rewards cards and less used cards. I like to craft, so I replaced the leather pulls with a rhinestone studded Eiffel Tower, to remind me of a trip to France."
4.0,"Just got mine for my birthday and I love it so much!!! I'm worried about washing it but, its warm and looks great! Get bigger than you think you would need."
4.0,"Made well, looks great, not to big, not small, just perfect. The lightening bolt is the logo for my work and I wear mine almost daily. Love it."
4.0,"It's a little tight and it fits weird in some places, but it's nice.<br /><br />I've noticed that the shiny is somewhat peeling off around the arms though."
4.0,"Ok....so waist wise they fit amazingly I'm a 2XL but ordered a 3XL....only issue is I'm 5'10 and they are a little short, but not so much to where I can't live with it. They are very comfy I just have to wear flats or something like that with them so I don't look like I'm wearing high water pants...."
4.0,Very cute and well made. Doesn't look cheap and holds its structure.
4.0,Kaos makes excellent quality products.  These go in and out easily and stay clean.  My only issue is that the color doesn't match my flesh very well which defeated the purpose of buying them.
4.0,"not bad sunglasses, the fit is not as comfy as I expected...I've been accustomed to plastic frames, so these metal ones do not fit the same. They also seem very wide on my face. They are stylish and the lens seems very nice. The frames stick out from the sides, so ear protection does not fit over the shafts without feeling very uncomfortable. The case is a nice addition."
4.0,"Fits a little small, I'm 5'8&#34; and anywhere between about 185-195.  Quality still seems ok, probably will wear them more once I am down in the 170's..."
4.0,I loved the bad and its constructed well. The only change I would make to the design is for the strap to be made of the same material as the purse instead of the current strap it has. I am a female and I use it often. Enjoy.
4.0,"It was nice, but WAY too small.  I'm a size 12 (but larger on top -- the girls need room to breath!), and the XXL was practically squeezy.  I could zip it so far, but it wouldn't go all the way up.  So, I don't believe they are American sizes.  Sized for smaller people. BUT, the coat itself was GORGEOUS, and I was bummed to have to return it.  If you're planning to buy one, which if you likey, I'd recommend it, just consider the sizing and order bigger. :)<br /><br />The seller was wonderful in that regard, and I am expecting the payment to hit my account any day now."
4.0,"This Women's Casual Elegant Cocktail Maxi Dress from G2 Chic is very pretty.  I got the Green-A13 color for my mom and it is a gorgeous teal color just like in the picture.  It‚Äôs a versatile dress and can be dressed up or down depending on accessories and shoes paired with it.<br /><br />The material is light and thin, but not see through, so it is a perfect summer dress.  And it will also look cute with a denim jacket in the Spring/Fall when the weather is a bit cooler.  It‚Äôs a very soft, silky material that is super comfortable.  It is well made, no loose or uneven stitches.<br /><br />Sizing - She normally wears a size 8/10 and the medium fits perfectly around the chest, shoulders and waist.  But she is 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it falls a bit short - right above her ankles.  From the pictures it looks like it would be a bit longer, more like a floor length dress you‚Äôd wear with heels.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for providing this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.  I would definitely buy from them again."
4.0,No instructions. Unable to reset the timer. No other option than wait til minute is over. Unable to set the date. Easy cut wrist size adjustment. Color is as shown. It'll do for a young child. My son wont take it off.
4.0,"Ordered these for my daughter's Halloween costume (80's aerobics).  They are a bit big for a 2.5 year old (they fit me as an adult) but they stay on. Not sure how long the headband will make it during trick-or-treating, but it was the best sweatband set for kids I've been able to find."
4.0,its all it says it will be.
4.0,"I love the socks and the arm guards, and they're bright, beautiful, and fun. The 4 stars was for comfort: they itch. Big time."
4.0,"Very comfortable , I wear it for work . Get a size up the elastic is kinda tight"
4.0,"Okay , doesn‚Äôt make my palm get blisters from holding the handle bar for too long"
4.0,"It came earlier than expected which is great and it looks exactly like the picture the only thing that bothered me was the fact that the bag it came in was opened and it looked like someone just put them in there and folded the bag up and placed it in shipping. Also on the bottom  and top of the goggles they have these little black clips in them that have no function for them, but mine was missing one which was a bit annoying it's not that noticeable, but still.... Also when I took it out of the packaging there was a strong plastic smell as well but it didnt last long. Overall its a decent product good for someone who likes gags"
4.0,"Love it, I normally wear a 16 and I ordered a XXL and it fit perfectly.  The pants are wide legged as described and the top part is a little more form fitting giving you a nice shape in the outfit.  Bought this to wear t a holiday party, can't wait to see how it looks all dressed up."
4.0,"Most reviews said size up but S was the only size available in this print so I took a chance. Fits perfectly! 4 stars because I thought it was going to be a soft sweatshirt material, but instead it‚Äôs terry. Pocket is in the perfect place, sleeves are nice and long, roomy fit as expected. Love it!"
4.0,"They fit nicely over my regular glasses and do a great job of blocking the bright sun in front and on both sides, my full circle of vision. They come with a nice soft cloth bag to prevent them from getting scratched when not in use.  But they are a little hard to open...it takes 2 hands."
4.0,Hat was a little shallow but has plenty of width and looks great
4.0,Fits true to size everywhere EXCEPT the arms. It‚Äôs a little tight and has no stretch there. I wish the arms weren‚Äôt tight. I would go up a size but the waist area would be too big.
4.0,"They are rather thin for gloves, but fit fine and are comfortable.  The true test will be to see how long they last."
4.0,"Really cute, love the color.  Seaming around leg holes/butt is snug but I'm pretty full bootied. Otherwise a good fit, very flattering. I'm 5'2&#34; 140lbs and I ordered a large in the wine color."
4.0,Only complaint: snaps are hard to open; maybe this will improve with time.  Comfortable and looks nice.
4.0,"I'm really digging this latest trend in outdoor clothing: the sun hoodie.<br />As a person who burns fairly easy, (read, ginger), and who also hates wearing sunscreen, this style of shirt is amazing!<br />Full sun protection, yet super lightweight and breathable. No sunburn and no greasy sunscreen to collect dirt and grime on the trail.<br />Love the thumb holes to keep the sleeves down too.<br />I'm a bigger framed guy, 6', 250#, wide shoulders, I usually wear a 2x and have room to wiggle.<br />This shirt runs really small though.<br />The 2x was skin tight on me.<br />My 16 year old daughter snatched it right up though and it fits her quite well, (she wears a medium to large in women's size).<br />I ordered a more well recognized brand of this same style of shirt and am really digging it.<br />This one's a good one too, as long as you get the correct size."
4.0,Fits and is supportive.  Has been holding up washing in the washer and air drying.
4.0,"This thing is great - it works! Time, date, alarm, stopwatch, and light. Everything you need.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I wish the band was a little longer. I'm on the fourth hole from the end and the end of the band doesn't stay in the holder very well.<br /><br />AND here's a fun game you can play with this watch - using the stopwatch, try to stop it when the milliseconds are at 00. Hours of entertainment!"
4.0,Liked very much.  However when really cold mukluchk gloves were warmer.  Wool on outside and soft polyester inside
4.0,Love my new bracelet but it was drenched in what smelled and felt like olive oil
4.0,Key holder looks great but it Does not fit my 2008 fz6 fazer key. Great materials used in construction of item and looks awesome but i wish it fit my key.
4.0,Can't wait to wear this to a bachelorette party! The pockets were a pleasant surprise!!
4.0,I actually like it. However it runs a little bit small for size L
4.0,Came in just in time for a local pirate-fest.  Awesome shirt but it does fit a little tighter than expected.  Seems to be a bit clingy and stretchy.  Still overall happy with it! Thanks!
4.0,Very roomy. Little stretch and give to them. My reasoning for 4stars is the zipper. It comes down sometimes.
4.0,It‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs slightly large.
4.0,I chose these shoes because I thought them attractive and unique.  The beige part of the leather is soft to the touch and I loved the shoe.  My problem is a high instep and I could not get them on easily. I don't want to spend a lot of time getting into boots and so I returned them.
4.0,Great colour and fit
4.0,"I sent this to my Grandson who is the size of an average 12 year old.  Sorry, no sizes here, but I sent him an xs adult and it fit really well.  The length on the robe just skirts the floor and he‚Äôs super happy with it.  Of course it‚Äôs printed, not actually patched and the fabric is lightweight, but he loves it and even wanted to sleep in it a couple nights!"
4.0,"Then poles were great, they came with no damage, and they were the correct length. Only issue was that the ending poles were not specified, they were not correct, couldn‚Äôt fit the poles around the tent peice."
4.0,These fit my glasses perfectly and they are lightweight which makes them easy to wear. It is so nice that they have a spring to slide onto glasses. If your lenses are a little larger you can bend the clips out to fit. I will buy again.
4.0,"Very good quality. I am very between sizes, so i ordered the xxl, but i am going to return for the xl. The xxl had too much room in the front"
4.0,"This is a lovely sweater.  It looks very nice as part of an outfit. If you want it for warmth though, this really isn‚Äôt the sweater for that."
4.0,The color is as pictured but I expected to be ‚Äúdark green‚Äù like the OEM.
4.0,Very comfy and seem to last! The pair I bought quite awhile back still remain without holes ;)
4.0,"These are nicely padded bike shorts! The padding in the front didn't need to go quite so far up but didn't interfere with anything, just not necessary there. I wore these on a long road biking event and they helped keep me from getting so sore. They are nice quality and had a cute design on them as a bonus. I like the length too. Not capris but not too short. Overall a very good value for the money!"
4.0,"Very cute and can look great with so many things.  It‚Äôs runs a bit small in the chest. Also, a little thinner than I would like.  Overall still very cute and I can always wear a blazer or cute jacket over it."
4.0,its very nice but i got a size above my normal size and it was too big..n .i ordered a large and its perfect
4.0,"Yeah, they were cheap, pretty much a gimme with the other stuff I ordered at the time. But they do have the Terminator style, and for however long they last, I'll look good."
4.0,Glasses are fantastic. Case is a little thin but offers protection and I love that it is bamboo. Great!
4.0,Good product but it's a very long in size!
4.0,"Very cute! It does smell, but not terrible! Holds a lot for the size!"
4.0,"At first I got a large and I'm 6 ft 0,5 and I weight 165. I'm a lean, athletic guy. I wouldn't say That this is a compression shirt in large at all... too wrinkly but I exchanged for medium (still waiting for the refund, maybe UPS sucks at returns) and it's little to no wrinkles and not overly tight. It's just right. Good for running 30-45 degrees with a sweater on top. Worth it"
4.0,Love it it was a gift to a dear friend
4.0,"Really cute! They fall off my toddler's feet very easily but they're soft, thick and well made."
4.0,They were just as I expected.
4.0,Really cute for a day on the beach or the boat.  Make sure to upsize a couple of sizes.
4.0,"These things look monstrously huge, but the length and width of the indentation for your foot is actually about as advertised, maybe even a little narrow. The cup-shaped surface means they aren't very comfortable to wear for hours, but they have a nice massage effect for that half-hour when you step out of the shower or pool. Pretty solid, overall."
4.0,"This little Crabby Wallet is the cutest thing. Pardon me but i had to say it! It is ideal for traveling on the road, train or bus. It will hold your ticket and allows for you to carry just the major necessities and nothing more!!! For instance, let's say you are traveling and the train/bus that you are traveling on makes a stop at a station or rest area....vending machines are available or a small eatery of some sort. You can place all of your necessities inside this little wallet, leaving your purse in the overhead compartment and go purchase your things without having to rummage for your wallet to make a purchase. Little Crabby to the rescue! It fits right in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />  From your car, you may not want to bring your whole purse with you. You can place your cash or credit card inside the wallet, even though the wallet is smaller than the norm, that wide rubber band will hold your card down and the pressure from that and the card will hold your cash as well. On the inside of the wide band are strips of rubber, to grip the purse. No chance of it sliding off. There is a loop where you can slip your finger(s) through it for extra security. It will easily fit in your pockets.<br /><br />  I absolutely adore this little gem. I sometimes travel by train and this will hold my boarding ticket and any cash or card if I need it for purchasing special items.<br /><br />  *Crabby is lightweight<br /><br />  *Available in a variety of colors - ladies, you can match your other purse accessories<br /><br />  *Great use even for a pre-teen to use at school for purchasing lunch, vending machine items or items from the school store.<br />  Some students now have to carry student ID cards to make purchases at their school so this would be perfect for them<br /><br />  *The only thing that I would like even more about this wallet...would be that the band would be located more in the middle of the<br />  of the wallet than on the end. I feel that would make it even more secure. As of now, I feel like my cash would slip out....even<br />  though it hasn't and probably wont. I, myself alone would be more....comfortable....if the band was in the middle.<br />  But, that's just me ya'll.<br /><br />  I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Fit perfectly, love it !"
4.0,Sweatshirt worked perfect for applying a vinyl for my business however it shrunk after washing in cold water. Tumble dry low heat.  Wish it didn't shrink.
4.0,Too snug in the hips
4.0,"This hat is comfortable from the sun. It has 3&#34; Wide Brim. In the back there is a pocket to put ice and it helps you cool the neck and back. I put 4 stars not for the hat (the hat 5 stars), because the hat doesn't have a lace. I was in Florida for 2 weeks. The hat keeps getting blown away because of the wind. I had to saw a lace. Because of this I put 4 stars."
4.0,"Somewhat small. The key hole is larger than picture shown, this maybe due to being little to small. Nice swim suit though. Like the feel of it. The bottoms only match the little top strap. If one size larger would have been better, so runs little small."
4.0,"Very pretty dress. I am 5'4"" 140lbs and ordered a large. It fits a little loose in some areas. But the fabric doesnt have any strech or give, so i think if i would have gotten a smaller size it would have been uncomfortable to move in. You get what you pay for with this one: pretty but probably wont hold up for a lot of wear."
4.0,"Well made, but a little large, particularly at the neck."
4.0,These are very cute and the gold details keep them from looking ordinary. They are more sturdy than most glasses of this style. They shade my eyes without glare.
4.0,Nice board shorts
4.0,I usually love Johnny-O stuff.  Ordered a different size and received two sizes too big.  Didn't have time to return.  I'll order again tough.  The quality of their products is really good.  Wish I lived in Florida.  easier to find deals on this brand of clothes.
4.0,"Made for skinny legs, which I don‚Äôt gave"
4.0,"These things are pretty snazzy, I just wish the batteries were replaceable. I mean, you could pop the thing apart and change the batteries, but you may break it in the process."
4.0,"I liked the quality of the fabric - nice texture - I like it a bit lighter because I get overheated quickly.  I didn't love the elastic around the wrists, but that seems to be a thing now.  The size fit as expected.  You can play around with the ties to be in back or in front, in a bow - whatever floats your boat!"
4.0,The strap looks good on my watch but it does have its flaws. It starts to fray abit after a while. The needle holes start to fray and makes the hole bigger.
4.0,"Product great quality for the price. Especially with the two sets. Lace was beautiful and the garters fit well. My only complaint was even though it was white and not ivory, the white still had a warmness to it and it didn't match my wedding dress. My dress was more of a bright white."
4.0,Too long to just hang over my neck even at smallest adjustment. Have to put over shoulder to to work. A bit disappointing.
4.0,Good quality and very clear vision with them. They scratch easily.
4.0,Has a thick handle easy to carry heavy items. Lined inside easy to clean.
4.0,The blue tortoise is almost black...not as light as photo. Otherwise fine!
4.0,I bought the same brand and size without pockets first so then I bought these. These are not as soft as those without pockets. Also fit a little tighter. But still a great pair of workout shorts
4.0,I love this glasses ! its cute and fits well
4.0,The color is more pale than the photo...really wanted a deeper purple...
4.0,"Nice buckle, and a nice finish. It's a large buckle for sure. Larger than most others. Caveat emptor."
4.0,"I love my luggage tags. Great price, fast delivery. They look very classy."
4.0,it s a dress !!
4.0,"quality, look"
4.0,This dress is good for the price. The only thing I disliked about it is that the seaming didn‚Äôt seem to be even and I kept trying to get the dress to lay the right way. Wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker since the price point is good.
4.0,I loved this product. It works best with average size women head. (I have a big head so it did squeeze me a bit).... works best with no glasses.... (I wear glasses so it was too much glare).... other than that it was awesome and cute!
4.0,Love them get lots of compliments.
4.0,Got these for my (adult) minion costume.  They are so nice I wear them for everyday as well.  Cool!
4.0,Nice watch though some times the ticking can be very loud.
4.0,The crescent is larger than I'd expected but it's very pretty.  It is also lighter in weight than I expected.  It's a Christmas gift so I won't be wearing it to see if the weight of it is an issue but for the price it's a good value.
4.0,Cute and light to wear
4.0,"I wish it had an adjustable waist line.  It fit tighter than expected with the zipper, but I love how it flows with the pleats all around."
4.0,"Great design and comfortable, but runs a size too big."
4.0,"Very cute, get lots of compliments on it all the time!"
4.0,A tad tight in the bust so maybe size up if you are a busty gal. I ordered a xxl and the waist is true to size though.<br />Lovely otherwise! Will be great for fall.
4.0,"There's no way to adjust the midsection of this monokini, so it's important that you be at least 5'6&#34; or taller.  My wife is 5'3&#34; and ordered a medium and there was too much fabric in the middle, while the rest of the suit fit well (cups on this one are especially flattering).  She was bummed she couldn't keep it.  Return was simple and hassle free."
4.0,It's not as loose as I thought it was going to be. But it fits and it's cute.
4.0,Very nice dress. Like the thickness of the fabric and flow of the dress. Only problem is that the zipper is frail and opened up in the middle when I put it on. Would definitely buy another colour. Colour yellow was beautiful.  Received a lot of compliments.
4.0,They work well & are stylish. Wish they came in different frame colors though.
4.0,I like Desigual designs and this is a very nice bag. I wish the handles were real leather as these will definitely fray after some use.
4.0,Skirt fit well. Looks exactly like the picture.  Very long on me. I am 5 foot... ordered a medium. Downside very hot. Material had a drapery look and feel. Very thick. Hard to move around in if you‚Äôre my height in flats. But overall good buy. Very pretty.
4.0,"Perfect for what I needed, a quick and easy punk look for a cosplay. It was a bit bigger than I expected, especially around the midsection as I‚Äô a pretty skinny guy, but besides that it fit fine. I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô0 and 135 LBS for reference. The material seemed a bit cheep, but its exactly what you pay for."
4.0,"Very cute! Easy to use, only down side is it makes the top of my ear hurt."
4.0,I bought these for my husband and he said that he liked the way they fit and the way they look.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"These bands are comfortable. However: my wrist is VERY small, at 5.75 inches. So as you can see from the photo, the metal clip sticks out from the side of my wrist when I make the band as small as it will go (and it still slides around on my wrist a bit).  I am a sewer so I am thinking about ‚Äúresizing‚Äù this band to make less strap so the clip will be at the back. Also, the band is starting to ‚Äúpill.‚Äù When I have worn through all four bands I will probably buy another set because of the comfort. (But NOTHING beats the looks of my Apple stainless steel milanese band!)"
4.0,"The wallet worked very nicely.  I wish it was a little roomier, but overall it does the job."
4.0,"A little disappointed that there is a seam down the middle-front. Not sure why they didn‚Äôt put it in the back. Poor construction on their part, otherwise the dress is cute."
4.0,it's really cute and sheer but it's a little small so I suggest you order 1 size up.
4.0,It is true to size.  Not as soft or comfortable as it looks.  I've washed it twice and the color on the starts is starting to fade.
4.0,"I got this quick drying shirt for my husband because he likes to bike ride and jog a lot, so these quick drying shirts come in handy. I took a chance on buying him a black shirt because he normally goes for lighter shirts. I ordered him a size large since I know it's a slim fit. Well, it ended up being too slim fit for him because it's too tight on his arms; however, I like the shirt and I too go bike riding so I plan on using this shirt for my rides. It's super comfy and made of good quality. It just wasn't his style but since it's just plain black and still small enough, I can get away with wearing it. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"The sleeves are hella long and the fit is somewhat small. However, I fear if I ordered another size up, the sleeves would be about six inches too long. Good quality and nice looking other than that."
4.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and they came packaged very nicely with another pair of earrings, they look very nice and not cheap at all"
4.0,relief that this dress fits. thank you for being true to your descriptions.
4.0,"I got this for the holidays and I really like it. The sleeves are a little strange in the way the draping works in person, and it's not really a sweater so much as a knit shirt, but somehow it all works out and the bow detail is very cute. I ordered a Med (I'm usually a US size 10/Med) and it fits like the picture."
4.0,"Works as advertised, no problems. allows custom text. It was easy to use right out of the box. my friends loved it and are planning to get one. i could draw my own images and etc."
4.0,Too. Small.sort of pinch ears....
4.0,"Not as thick as I was hoping for, but it is nice."
4.0,"The apron is nice and long, however the chest coverage is rather small. But all in all, it protects your clothes and has nice deep pockets. I'm very happy with it."
4.0,I bought these charms for my mom and I. They look great on our charm bracelets and have held up well. I have worn mine daily for over 6 months and it is still in great shape and the wording can be read. The only complaint that I have is that each charm says &#34;Mother&#34; on one side and &#34;Daughter&#34; on the other. I would prefer it if each charm said either &#34;Mother&#34; OR &#34;Daughter on both sides. It just seems kind of odd to me.
4.0,"For the price, you can't go wrong with this. I bought them more for the look and not practicality but I wish I would have been more diligent. I wore these to a cold tailgating and they are not cold weather friendly. I had two pair of socks on and still my feet were freezing. That being said though, for the price they can't be beat."
4.0,"Good, but a little big"
4.0,"A little big for a medium, but haven't washed it yet so it may shrink..love the color and the soft fabric!"
4.0,"This bracelet arrived in an attractive gift box, which noted that it is Eco-friendly. I'm not sure if they meant the box or the bracelet, or even why that matters except to garner praise for the manufacturer. Aside from the box it came in a small cello pocket.<br /><br />From the pictures in the listing, I was a little concerned that the larger chain would be too heavy and clunky, but it isn't. The bracelet is beautiful. The gold of the chains looks rich and shiny. It doesn't have that fake, flaky look that cheap gold tone metals have. The zirconia sparkles in the light so that it would probably look, at a casual glance, just like a diamond.<br /><br />The lobster claw clasp is small, so it can be hard to open and hang onto. That isn't helped by the fact that the other side of the clasp was not used, so that you have to place the clasp into a link in either the end of the bracelet or a link of the extender chain.<br /><br />In spite of this minor issue, I might absolutely love this bracelet. I can say it's one of the prettiest I've ever owned. However, size does matter. If the total length of the bracelet is included in the listing, I missed it. I noted that it came with an extension chain, so I believed that would make it fit a larger wrist. I was wrong. I would be able to get it around my wrist with help from my husband to fasten the clasp, but it would be so tight on me as to be uncomfortable. I've read some reviews that mention it being too large or just the right size. For a bigger boned woman, that translates to too small. The categorization of sizing as too big, too small or just right isn't accurate enough. I would be happier if the listing had provided the total length of the bracelet, perhaps with and without the extension. I will definitely keep the bracelet. I will enjoy wearing it as well, after I replace the extension chain with one just a little bit longer."
4.0,Preparing for the cold weather
4.0,"The size is tricky. If you are busty or trying to cover up your tummy, this may not be for you. It tapers in at the waist, not like the models on the photos. If you look at the real photos of other reviewers, you can see what I mean. Still cute and material is nice."
4.0,I wanted to put a laptop in it. But Ota juat no quite big enough. Okay for maybe an airbook or large Samsung tablet.
4.0,"Ordered my usual bathing suit top size 12 and it fit through the midsection area fine. I'm thick in the middle and it concealed my lumps and bumps nicely. Around the chest it was not tight enough to stay up. The cups are too full and have a slightly stiff cup lining so they stood out from my chest like bubbles.<br />It seems to be made for someone with a fuller bust. While I wear a 34D bra, I'm a bit saggy so I don't fill the cups out. Returning for that reason.<br />The torso length is about 12-13 inches, since it's ruched in the front it varies.<br />Nice fabric, not thin. The blue is more of a royal and the flower colors are pretty, pink and aqua. Only odd thing is the leaves are brown, I was expecting an olive green color.<br />Overall nice top. Just not right for my bustline."
4.0,"It does not come with the black crystal guard.<br />I love the band, I just wish I knew it about the guard."
4.0,"I find the shorts a smidge short, but my nephew actually loves them. He wants to wear them and requests them periodically. They feel very soft and comfortable and they wash up well. The shirt is decent but oddly not quite as soft as the shorts. Still soft, though, and a great shirt for the southern summer heat. Overall it's a good combo."
4.0,They where bit chunky but still cute
4.0,"They are very comfortable and fit true to size, but they are not flattering, especially in the back. And since they show the cheeks a little, I don't know. That said, they're a lot less revealing than the reviews made it seem like. They are OK, I'll wear them but not my favorite jeans."
4.0,"I used to ahve a watch like this as a kid, so bought it more as a nostalgic piece, and it did me proud! These days I am used to larger watches so when I put this one on it looked small on my wrist. Still does the trick though and a great price."
4.0,"I debated on getting these sunglasses based on some of the reviews but I love them, I got the silver and gold!"
4.0,Looks great but has a terrible odor !!
4.0,"Looks exactly like photos. Fits great. True to size. You can team up with a dress belt. Material is soft enough for long wear. Highly recommended. I'm 166 lbs and 5'5"" tall and M fits perfectly."
4.0,"I wear flip flops all the time during the summer outside, and much of the year inside my house (separate pairs to keep the floors cleaner), and am always looking for a good buy.  These are good for the price and, unlike one review I read, spot-on for size (I went with a larger size due to that review and was sorry I did)."
4.0,The shipping was great.  the fit is as expected.  The straps have a plastic attachment that digs into my skin and its horribly uncomfortable.  I will remedy this by stitching the strap and taking off the plastic but that defeats the purpose of the adjustable strap and i wish i had just bought something without the plastic adjuster.
4.0,Simple dress. I added a belt to give it some more shape. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the material but for the price I really can‚Äôt complain too much.
4.0,"I got this to have a light jacket for my trip to Michigan and I was perfect. Not to thick and not too thin. The design is really cute. I got the yellow color which was a little brighter than the picture, I was expecting it to be a more muted yellow but it was bright. Not neon or anything but somewhere in between. I am between a large and medium normally so I went with medium which was a good choice so I would recommend ordering on the smaller side."
4.0,"Beautiful, but a tad small in the bust.  I can still pull it off though."
4.0,Love it! It‚Äôs the perfect fall sweater.
4.0,Little too big but nice dress
4.0,Love the soft fabric and great design. I think it runs a bit large and I should have sized down one size. I will still enjoy wearing it though. Great product and great price point .
4.0,"Fast delivery and watch is really different looking. Getting compliments, love the band I have little wrists and it fits all sizes."
4.0,"Order your usual size. I ordered larger due to reviews, but they actually run true to size. I'm a large, bought an extra large...  Should have bought a large! Cute sweatpants for the price. Thick material."
4.0,"So many sweaters lately are THIN and NOT suitable for cold unless you layer......think cuddl duds and a blouse under many other sweaters these days<br /><br />This could be alone or when truly cold ....yes a shirt or nice layer underneath ........but i freeze easily sooooo this may not apply to all<br /><br />Mine is the Navy , white w/ funky leopard like black pattern then grey and black bottom w/ white sleeves<br />It looks good !<br />Very unique and people have complimented on the design<br /><br />Washes well in cold water  and i used the gentlest setting on dryer .........probably most times i should just let it lay flat on a drying table .....but it did NOT shrink on me on the low dryer setting . So that is a plus for me<br /><br />If you think you would like this .........it is worthwhile<br /><br />If for some reason it is NOT as expected.......I always go by Amazon‚Äôs great return policy !!!<br />Amazon made it easy to buy safely !!!"
4.0,"My weight was a little towards the top of my fluctuated amount when I got this and tried it on and it still fit. The button pleat area did not drape perhaps quite as fluidly as I would have wanted, but now that I am down about ten pounds, it should be just fine. The material was very huggy feeling, which is nice and the biggest reason why I am keeping this. I was hoping for a slightly dressier, sleeveless top and that is what I got. It feels smooth, and cool and is not going to be a problem with needing anything underneath because it not too sheer. Just taking it out of the bag and laying it on the bed was enough for the majority of the wrinkles to smooth out as it was not packed in the neatest way, so that gives me hope when I will wash it before wearing. I am pretty pleased with it so far."
4.0,"Good, heavy-duty band. Good, if a bit redundant clasp. Be very careful adjusting for size. There are no directions for cutting this to size (why four instead of five stars) and mistakes can't be undone."
4.0,Very bulky good for heavy-duty jobs but very difficult to wash dishes by hand.  I would like to return the second pair at no charge for shipping.  (I ordered two pair).
4.0,"Fairly accurate fit. Eyelets are not backed so they go completely through skirt. I recommend wearing a slip under to stop and unwanted skin showing. Material is ok, a little on the cheap side but it will work."
4.0,i love the pendent but the necklace that comes with it is terrible. It changed color in just 1 week. I replaced the necklace piece with a better necklace.
4.0,"These are good reading glasses.  You get (5) five pairs of reading glasses, 1 cloth carrying pouch, and 1 lense cloth.  The glasses come in different colors and are uni-sex.<br /><br />The box was package well and none of the glasses were scratched or damaged.  Each glass was wrapped in its own plastic bag ad marked with the lense's magnification.  The glasses were clean and very clear.  There is a blue-light film to protect your eyes if you stare in the computer screen all day.  These glasses are not polarized.<br /><br />I didn't like the frames because they were too light and kept slipping down my nose.  When I have time, I'm going to adjust the frame's nose gap and arms with hot steam so that they fix better on my face.<br /><br />My vision isn't that bad (1.5x) and I wanted to leave extra pairs of glasses in rooms that I often read small prints.  Because of the price,  I don't worry about misplacing them."
4.0,Maybe add some extra fabric for even more coverage.
4.0,"Pretty colors, nice feel to the cloth....but band seems a little to tight on my head even after washing"
4.0,This was a cheap necklace but it doesn't look cheap.  Will get a lot of wear of this set!  It goes with everything!!
4.0,"Nice bag, just wish handle was longer for cross body wear."
4.0,"thought these would be compatible with buckles for our boat cover, but weren't.  beware that all 1 inch buckles are not the same."
4.0,"While this isn't the most flattering hat--the color is too close to a sickly version of my skin tone and the bow is too cute for my sensibilities--it does a great job of protecting my face and neck from the sun.  I have a large head and it fits me perfectly, but if you need it smaller it's adjustable. I thought I'd never use the chin strap, but the brim is wide enough that without it the had would fly away in the slightest breeze. Because I don't love the look it's my gardening hat, and for that it's perfect."
4.0,Like stlye but I wore first time lean on table pull the string thread out I was disappointed  bad quality I guess
4.0,"Great colors - does have a pocket as some had expressed concern the pocket was just ‚Äúprinted‚Äù - it is not, however, wrinkle free, as advertised"
4.0,Fit perfect I love it doesn‚Äôt feel cheaply made good material
4.0,"excellent, love them"
4.0,"These are amazing for the price! The only off thing about them is the little black plastic piece on the finger part will slip off. I can slip it back on so far but it seems like it will be easy to lose. Otherwise, Fantastic item!"
4.0,Metal frame is sturdy. The lens are a lower quality plastic but they look cute and help to block the sun.
4.0,Only wish I could have gotten a M/L flex fit. Great looking hat though. I bought this for a friend for our Army/Navy rivalry game in December
4.0,Cute and fun!  Probably won't last forever but they are seasonal and I like them!
4.0,"They will d, nothing exceptional."
4.0,"I have always used those straps that attach to your glasses, and are supposed to keep your glasses from falling off of your face and head. They worked okay most of the time, but they didn't really keep your glasses from slipping down your nose, and that tail flipping around in the breeze always bothered me.....and then I saw these straps, and thought that I would try them out. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well they worked. I attached them to my glasses with very little effort, and they were pretty easy to adjust. There is quite a bit of leeway between being very very loose to being so tight on your head that you think that you need the jaws of life to get them off of your head (you should never need the jaws of life to get them off of your head). I put these on my glasses, and went for a walk, and never once did I have to reach up and slide my glasses up on my nose. I was very windy outside, and normally I would constantly be readjusting my glasses every few minutes....But, with this strap on there...the thought never crossed my mind. I could see using this strap for a lot of sports type outings. I snow ski, road cycle, hike and sail, and can see myself using these straps for all of those things. In the short time that I have used these straps, I did find a couple of things that might need a little upgrade, but I don't think that any of these things are a real dealbreakers. These are the cons.... With the strap on there, the glasses seem a little bulky if you need to put your glasses back in their cases or your shirt pocket. Another thing that I noticed is that the adjustment nobs can get a little sticky at times, a you have to tug on them a little harder when you are trying to loosen the straps on your glasses. Like I said, not a deal breaker...but just thought that I needed to mention it. The other thing that I noticed was the rubber connecters that go over your glasses when you install them can be a little uncomfortable at first. I am thinking that I am still gettin used to the wires being on my glasses, and probably, someday, I will get used to it....but it was just something that I noticed. So, if you are tired of constantly pushing your glasses back up to the bridge of your nose...give these a try!"
4.0,"I have really sensitive skin, so take this with a grain of salt. The scarf has pretty colors and is big enough to tie in many different styles. I just expected it to be softer. I plan to wash and dry several times to see if I can soften the fabric."
4.0,"The pendant falls off easily, took needle nose pliers and pressed the clasp down so it wouldn‚Äôt come off and get lost."
4.0,"I really needed some horseshoe rings so I decided to grab these because of the cute diamonds.  Sadly, the cutest one was missing two studs straight out the package.  I needed them right away so I cant send them back for a replacement but other than that the rings are a good fit!"
4.0,Fits larger hands
4.0,very nice and very comfortable
4.0,These are so awesome. Quality is good & they look great. I would say the only down side is my teen is on the heavier side 220 lbs and they are a bit too snug around his calf... bummer. Guess they are not one size fits all.
4.0,"Bought this for my Halloween costume.  Great hat, but it fits a bit snug.  Not sure that it will fit an adult male (my husband can't wear it) but it should be okay for most females, and teens-children"
4.0,"I ordered some of these in both the lace and smooth for the purposes of anti-chafing of thighs while wearing dresses.<br /> SMOOTH: The smooth ones are perfect for this, they stay smooth on my legs and don't roll or slip up or down. At the end of a day of relatively heavy walking they are still in place, still smooth, no rubbing of the fabric or anything. I recommend them for anyone.<br />LACE: The lace ones are very cute and also stay in place etc. but if you are wearing them to keep your thighs from chafing there is an additional concern. They do the job and comfortably keep your thighs from rubbing, however they are textured themselves and as a result they chafe each other. By the end of the day (not a heavy walking day either) they had begun to fuzz up (like the soft side of velcro) on the inside of each thigh. You can only wear them once or twice before they wear through."
4.0,Brilliant colors and not too heavy
4.0,Perfect size for smaller wrists and children
4.0,"Good fabric, light weight and inexpensive. I use them to do gardening outside or furniture dusting inside the house."
4.0,I like the fabric and im looking forward to the new inseam length  the seller was very attentive and listened to the flaws of the product and changed them
4.0,Very elegant and sparkly!
4.0,"Nice workout leggings! The material was heavier than I expected but that's good - they aren't see-through!  I absolutely LOVE the pockets on each side.  And, the pink coloring is perfect - think I may even wear these for my Breast Cancer walk in October!"
4.0,"Buttery soft, super flattering to my curves, only sucky thing is that when I walk they ride up my thighs then they rub together (no fun in 90¬∞ heat & humidity). Not sure if it‚Äôs the shorts‚Äô fault or my thighs. Either way I do love these shorts"
4.0,"Beautiful, danty, good price, wish there were more designs to choose."
4.0,The fit is good except the length could be a tad longer. I'm 5'9&#34; and it came to the top of my foot... wish it was just a bit longer to hit the floor
4.0,This ring is pretty but I gave it a 4 star because although it is a pretty ring it looks a little to much like costume jewelry .
4.0,"It fits my watch the casio twiin sensor digital, however my watch came with a fabric band and the little retaining clips don't quite fit in to the rubber... With a little efort and a few curse words I was able to make it all work... Besides that it works just fine and fits fine... I like the fact that now the rubber doesn't absorb fuel and oil which I work with daily and is easy to clean unlike the fabric band my watch came with..."
4.0,Hate the way it screws on.
4.0,"Overall super simple sundress. The material is ok, which is why 4 stars. It is loose and flowy but not the most breathable. I like the olive green color on my darker olive skin. It's easy to put this on and get out the door. No fuss."
4.0,"I haven't used these that much yet, but when I have they work great."
4.0,Nice Dress but it rides up towards my upper thighs . dress doesn't hang as low as I assumed like in the picture ( and i'm short ) . other than that great dress and price !
4.0,"A bit high waisted, but the fit is great and so far they don't appear to be see through.  I love the interior color and key pocket."
4.0,I bought this for my 12 year old son. He is 5'5 and this fits perfect.  It arrived faster then expected. The only thing I was disappointed in is that the head is really white and the body is off white with a little bit of a yellow tint.  Besides that this is a great costume.
4.0,It is a little small to me but I do like it.  The design is not too flashy.  I think men or women can wear this.  Highly recommend it.
4.0,i don't wear a hat except for my jacket hood but with the extreme cold spell we've had in New England I'm glad i got this...I originally bought it for when i use the snow blower and the wind is whipping it back at me.  when it's 40 below windchill out it's good to have.
4.0,"It is really pretty and better than I anticipated, however, it has no give. There was one part that poked in to my head all night. I ended up putting a bandaid on the underside to give it some padding."
4.0,"just as listed, a bit heavy, so I need to take them off after 5 or 6 hours, but otherwise well made."
4.0,The band is definitely more for fashion than wear everyday and be comfy. Love the print. Very durable
4.0,"I admit I didn't buy this for its intended use. I bought it as a fire-glass. Handy on future sunny camp-outs. I do think it was a good buy. I got two for a super price, and it will set some tinder burning in a hot second. Nothing fancy, hard to break; I should be setting bark on fire with this for the rest of my life, providing I don't lose it."
4.0,I only tried it on when I got it and its cute.  I hadn't worn it yet but I'm sure when I do it'll be a head turner.
4.0,The watch band is a factory replacement and fits perfect.  The silicone band is durable and looks good for casual wear.
4.0,A button fly would have made them great but instead no fly at all.
4.0,"I really like these glasses.  From the quality to the style, I get many compliments when I wear them.  Also, They arrived in a timely manner.  They were not as large or ‚Äúoversized‚Äù as I thought but still beautiful glasses"
4.0,"It was sooo soft and I love the button down feature. So I ordered a medium -I'm 140ish and couldn't even try it on, seemed more like a small or x-sm.. I'm getting an xl and I really hope that'll fit better.. super nice for a great price =)"
4.0,makes your collar looks good but they tend to fall out and onto the floor when removing shirt. an improvement would be if the coating had more grip
4.0,"I like it, but I cannot say if the person for whom it was buy it really like it, I hope so."
4.0,I did not like the color.  Otherwise it was a wonderful purse.
4.0,"I'll keep these. But... I'm 5'9. Almost 5'10"". I had to roll the cuffs up. These are not capris, sorry. About 6"" too long."
4.0,"This is an attractive connected watch for everyday use but it really is not great as a fitness tracker. To receive texts and messages,use basic apps like weather and calendar it is great. For fitness tracking it is just too dressy to wear to the gym and lift weights or get all sweaty in a fitness class. I like to see my text alerts and read them on the watch instead of a phone. My phone stays on silent while the messages and calls appear on the watch. There a 6 faces to select from and it is easy to change the face. Alerts and alarms can be set as well, I use the alert to remind me to take medication."
4.0,Great for carrying all that pocket litter when traveling.
4.0,Good shower shoes.  Comfortable and provide good traction in gym shower.  I docked one star because water pools in the sandal. This is probably unavoidable with a design that actually provides a little bit of lateral support which I like.
4.0,a little small for every kind of women
4.0,Very comfortable- giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are a jersey type material - not silk/satin as stated.
4.0,"It's nice, it could be softer. Not worth $20 plus $5 shipping but my girls love the dresses so I guess that's what matters most."
4.0,"Nice, solid piece belt. I was told to order one size up from what I needed (46 instead of 44), but I've found I'm already using the shortest notch it has, so I might have to drill another notch at some point. Definitely more durable than the cheap bonded leather, which fits my own needs well, but maybe not quite stiff enough to make for a good gun belt."
4.0,"I like the feel of the material, it is very bouncy. However it does have big heavy pockets that lay awkwardly on the dress making it a little difficult to accessorize. I normally wear a medium/large size so I purchased a medium, it fits a little loose (the way I like it) so I would suggest ordering true to size or a size smaller than you would normally wear if you like it on the tighter side."
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous pendant with beautiful sparkle. Very well made. Arrived packaged nicely in a branded gift box. Would make a wonderful gift. It was smaller than I expected, just slightly smaller than a quarter. See picture. But the size was perfect once put on. The only downside is the chain is so short, which is a shame. I measured it at 15&#34; with a 1&#34; extender. It would be nice to see a longer extender or options for a longer chain.<br /><br />I purchased this necklace at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I would definitely repurchase this necklace as a gift if it had the option for a longer chain length as 16&#34; is just too short in my opinion."
4.0,"Nice, confortable and beautiful gloves. Just thas actually is a little bit darker brown compared with the online picture."
4.0,I love the fit it is awesome
4.0,"I love everything about it, it's perfect, except that the clasp is very small and a bit awkward to work around."
4.0,Item shrunk when washed üò¶
4.0,"This is a different look than what I expected. The ‚Äúpaper clip‚Äù chain is delicate but looks a little on a cheap side. However, it would be approved for a younger (teen or tween) girl."
4.0,OK but not as nice and cute as the picture.  Less dramatic.
4.0,"Super cute set. My 8 yo little guy likes it quite a bit. Fabric is very soft. Haven‚Äôt washed it yet, so not sure how it will hold up."
4.0,I get so many compliments on these but they had to be repaired with super glue when the arrived.
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, I like the length but the hem is off center which isn't a deal breaker for me, but I know for some it may be. The headline stated symmetrical, yet the hemline in the description says it is high-lo from side to side, which would make it an asymmetrical hem. Details details! Fit is as expected and fabric is incredibly soft and silky feeling but not see through."
4.0,I bought these as a gift. They're cute but in person these have more of a matte finish.
4.0,Sizes run smaller than listed
4.0,"Cute, white is a little see through. It runs a little shorter than the picture on the model but doesn't show anything if you're wearing high wasted pants. If you're a true XL this fits fine but where the elastic is fits a little snug"
4.0,Quality product and would reccommend.
4.0,"These fit well, keep my feet warm and are very comfortable. They are great for providing traction on slippery tile floors."
4.0,The shoulder isn't as slouchy as shown in the photo.
4.0,"Like previous reviews, it's a little smaller than you might think. And the chain is a little short for me. But I'm a larger lady, and it does fit."
4.0,"Looks great, but the directions on shorting the band could be better written."
4.0,Too short waisted.
4.0,"Not accidentally large, but this style of clothing naturally runs large. Much more of a casual dashiki as opposed to formal. Comfortable. If you're feeling worldly, go ahead and snag one."
4.0,Nice but somewhat small
4.0,"I bought this from universal for $60. I wouldn't say it's worth more than that. It only shows Ron, harry, Hermione, and dumbledore. I recommend buying it but not for this price!"
4.0,GOOD WATCH.
4.0,If you like the lok of retro large glasses you might enjoy these.  Great price!
4.0,Thick leather bands. So far i really like them. I use them to dress my watch up just a touch. Would buy them again!
4.0,"It runs a little small, I'd say. Not a ton. The buttons seem to need to come down a little further to be great pajamas for nursing."
4.0,"One shoe fits better than the other but overall, I'm very satisfied"
4.0,Good value for the price!  Ran a little on the large side
4.0,Loved the fit and style but they were terribly wrinkly at first.  After a few washings the wrinkling went away.
4.0,"This is very pretty.  It is well made and great quality.  The material is soft with enough spandex to hug your curves.  Unfortunately, I have a few more curves than I want.  It is fitted and would be very flattering on someone with fat rolls."
4.0,"Not real leather, but not too stinky either. I‚Äôm pleased with it for the price."
4.0,"Ordered for husband - who says - &#34;Nice belt to replace an old favorite. Tell others to order ONE size up&#34;. Hubby is a very slim 32, and, it just fits him as &#34;snug&#34;.<br /><br />Issue with first package arriving EMPTY was addressed and replaced immediately by Seller's CUST SERV folks."
4.0,"e precioso este conjunto, un poco peque√±as las tallas, hay que escojerlo una o 2 tallas mas grandes, pero es muy hermoso y de buena calidad"
4.0,Very cute.  Perfect size.  Interior lining has a weird cheap feel.  Like a plastic tablecloth from the party section at the dollar store.  Great value for price.
4.0,"It's the Summer of George! Good shirt. Light fabric, good colors but print is an iron on."
4.0,Its very nice and reasonably priced!  I would order again!
4.0,Christmas gift like the scarf match perfectly with the persons coat very soft and warm
4.0,Too large and not snug enough. I'm 5'5 and 135lbs. Order the XS-S size. Fun to wear for Halloween at the gym. Would be better if they were tighter.
4.0,"This plus size bikini bottom does fit,  but a little warning pay attention to the photo. If you have a large behind or a large stomach it will not sit on you like it does on the model one area will be shorter than the other . It does not come up high, see it fits like photo shows it rides on the hips at the bikini line. Great fabric really stretches and 24+ it's like a 24+ .DR J"
4.0,Beautiful. Excellent quality
4.0,Just as in the picture. Good quality.
4.0,"Thick and heavyweight hoodie.  A couple cons that knocked a star from the review were the lack of a a way to cinch the slightly over-sized hood (i.e. no drawstring or elastic) and the jacket was a bit of a short waist (2XL sat right at my belt-line, back pops above the pants when seated or bending).  Nice overall quality for the price (&lt; $10)."
4.0,"I like this watch. I‚Äôve been wearing it everyday for about 2 weeks. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as small as it is but it‚Äôs actually very nice because it doesn‚Äôt get in the way. The light is pretty dim it seems to only come from the top left corner of the face. I‚Äôve had them where the whole face lights up. That‚Äôs what I expected. Also the band is either too tight or too loose, I wish they had spaced the holes differently. All in all this is a great daily watch and it suits me just fine. For the price you‚Äôre getting a reliable little watch."
4.0,"I liked it but it was a little too tight, but I was able to fit in."
4.0,"Nice hat, seems well constructed. Wore it in temps in the 20s and was very comfortable so I hope it stays that way when the breezes start to blow"
4.0,"Present for my husband. He likes it very much, especially not having to pull entire card out & having RFID protection. He doesn't carry traditional wallet. Negative is he has to fold cash to fit in."
4.0,Very comfortable and I love the pocket on the side.  Only bad thing is they tend to roll down a little bit hen you sit or late down.  I‚Äôd still order again.
4.0,"These are super soft, but no compression at all. If you don't look like the fit model wear a long shirt to cover up a little."
4.0,"This is a cute tank top. It fits true to size, and maybe a bit larger.  I usually wear 12-14 and large was good and just a tad on the larger size.  Only reason it is not 5 stars is that it is see through.  I got the black but it shows a lot of skin."
4.0,I really like them. I got them for my daughters to give to each other.
4.0,"Cute dress! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 5 months pregnant. It fits great, no hem adjustments needed and I‚Äôll continue to wear it again after the baby is here.<br />Price was good. Wouldn‚Äôt have paid more for it though."
4.0,Very cute and fun dress up outfit! the quality was not good so i would not suggest it as an actual dress to wear out. and the jewels fell off pretty quickly!<br /><br />defiantly worth the price for the joy it has brought my daughter playing dress up.
4.0,I like everything about the sweater. The material and how it is able to keep you warm. BUT it‚Äôs too long.
4.0,It looks cool<br />But little small fits
4.0,It met my expectations. I would recommend purchasing this wallet!
4.0,Nice quality for price. Very happy.
4.0,"Ordered according to size guide and reviews.  When it arrived, it was way too big, so I returned it."
4.0,"smaller than i expected, but still it's a good wallet for cash and credit cards."
4.0,"it's not nearly as loose around the armpits as pictured which I was disappointed about and the bottom of the sleeve is a little tight on my arm, but the color is pretty, it's a good length for leggings, not too fitted so its comfortable and I don't feel like I have to suck it in."
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot, especially for the price.  I feel the cotton isn't the softest cotton in the world, but isn't terrible either (esp. for the price)."
4.0,"1st we open up the package it was already damage it had a rip on the back, i didnt have time to return it and get a new item since the swimming short was for vacation in a couple days so i just sow it up myself."
4.0,This is a Christmas gift so we'll see how much my granddaughter loves them .
4.0,"Cute dress, not the best fabric as it looks kind of shiny."
4.0,"He's comfortable in them but he's 5""7 and the pants run too long and the sleeves too long also.  So he rolls them up but he's satisfied with them"
4.0,When ordering this please beware it runs a bit small! I am a true Large (being 170 pounds) and I ordered an XL for extra room. The XL fits me snuggly with barely any room in my arms and chest.
4.0,"Good value !  Size seems appropriate, adjustable neck strap and waist ties are long enough !"
4.0,It's served me well. I'm afraid to wash it though. Looks like it will shrink.
4.0,Got this fun number in a xxl because I have curves and boobs lol.. It fits like a glove.. Got so many compliments though
4.0,Very pretty haven't had them long enough to see if they make a difference in hand pain.
4.0,Locket are very beautiful! Got some compliments too. üòä I personally felt like the necklace wasn‚Äôt matching enough to the lockets.
4.0,Work as designed.
4.0,"it‚Äôs a little see-through but if you wear a tan bra, it‚Äôs fine!"
4.0,Like it very much. Actually stays on my head.
4.0,I'm giving this a four star because of the customer service.<br /> Sadly this is no where close to my size. I am 140 and DD boobs and this was way too big .  I've tried a large and a medium and they seem to be the same size .
4.0,Nice bottoms! I wear a size 10 woman's and ordered the 12 and it fits a little tight. The material is really nice though seems like they will last nicer then the cheap ones I usually order!
4.0,"This watch winder has met all my expectations.  Having just purchased my fourth automatic, I decided I had had enough of having to constantly switch out my watches on my single watch winder.<br /><br />The Brookstone quad works totally as advertised and does it in a nifty way.  Each winder is seperately configurable for TPM and for direction CW, CCW and both and they turn independent of each other - which is pretty neat.  Anytime I walk in the room, one, or maybe two, of the watches will be turning.  It makes NO noise and my watches now keep better time than ever.  My Rolex was, I think, getting overwound by my last winder and was running fast (to my disappointment).  Now it keeps nearly perfect time.<br /><br />I searched on the net for the TPM settings for each watch but found out that one of my watches needed to have more TPMs than what was recommended.  It's now working perfectly.<br /><br />The stand looks almost elegant and is a great display for your watches (my wife even likes its looks).<br /><br />The only problem (my reason for not giving 5 stars) is that the electrical plug in the back sometimes falls out without you knowing it - ending up with at least one stopped watch before you notice.  It hasn't happened but the one time but I think could happen again.  You just have to make sure there's always power supplied when you put a watch in the case (easy to do because when you turn on the individual power switch for that watch, it will give a one revolution confirmation).<br /><br />UPDATE - After owning the winder for about 6 months, one of the four winders stopped spinning.  I called Brookstone and they immediately sent me a return sticker (I still had the original box) so I could return it - no charge.  I received a new winder in about 5 days and it works better than the original (the electrical plug is much more secure than the first unit).<br /><br />I would recommend this winder - especially for the price."
4.0,"It works well, does the job. it isn't as sturdy as some more expensive umbrellas but it works."
4.0,I liked the pants. The problem is the size is to bigger. I ordered a small but it was to big still
4.0,"I'm in between Sm and Md sizes. Ordered a medium and it is long in the torso (i.e., the pocket sits low and the shoulders fall back). In case anyone else makes the same mistake I did...the shirt is red, GREY, and blue. I thought it was white (I have a blue light filter on my phone), but it's definitely. I'll still be wearing it."
4.0,"Awesome glasses.  We are a family of 7 with small kids, these look very nice, are BPA free and shatterproof! Worth the cost! Only gripe here is sometimes they don't come out as clear from the dishwasher. It's hit or miss."
4.0,super cute but be careful! the fabric attached to the hoop starts peeling and could break easily
4.0,"Top and bottom fit great, fin is a little long but my daughter LOVES it!!"
4.0,Flattering and a great fit! Love the pockets.
4.0,wish it was longer to wrap multiple times
4.0,I liked color and design. Maybe little tight and not super comfy but still cute.
4.0,"I like this shirt, it‚Äôs soft and has a somewhat casual design/feel to it. It fits a tad small like most PB shirts though. I fear the fabric will pill easily though, so it‚Äôs a definite handwash."
4.0,Actually a perfect size purse. I was a little put off by the design at first - it's a little unusual but it's really grown on me and now I love it.
4.0,These are super cute. The direction that the hook faces makes them flip and sit upside down on me though. To be fair I have a really tiny nose so they are not super snug on me. Even though the flip I still really like them.
4.0,"Came fast, looks nice. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's a very nice peice of jewelry. Some reason came with a pair of turtle earrings."
4.0,This shirt will be great with leggings or jeans in the spring. It is a very thin material (it is not see through) that will keep me from wearing it in an Ohio winter. The shirt also runs a bit small so be sure to look at the measurements when ordering. I believe the sizing guide was also running small.
4.0,Was not my expected size I paid for.
4.0,Not as soft as we had hoped but a nice robe at a good price.
4.0,Not sure about the durability yet. Got it for my husband and it was too short. Seems like a good buy for the price.
4.0,Really like this coat!
4.0,The hat is super cute and much better quality than I expected.. only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is they don't pack it well and it came warped.. I even have a head form but unfortunately it's not fixable.
4.0,üëçüòä
4.0,Love them! True to size with smooth finish. I would have given 5 stars but I feel the abalone pattern could have been a better match... but they are still  totally worth it.
4.0,Cute!  5'2&#34; 115 The size 8 is workable but I wish it came in 1 size smaller.
4.0,I get so many compliments on this nose ring and how pretty is it. It's one of my favorites. The only thing is that it is very heavy and the clicker is very hard to open.
4.0,its comfortable and nice.
4.0,"I love the fit of this dress it's very flattering! I'm 5'6&#34; 133lbs 36B and I ordered a small which fits perfectly! It falls to my knees and has plenty of puff in the skirt. There's a few reasons I didn't give this dress 5 stars. The first is I ordered the royal blue assuming it be bright but it's darker practically navy blue. Second, the zipper comes up mid-back into the lace which was fine but my lace was torn a little away from the zipper but it was an easy fix. Lastly, the fabric is thick (which will be nice for colder nights) but attracts lint and dog hair like no tomorrow! All in all I do love this dress and will keep it especially because it's a great deal but keep a lint roller in my purse. ;)"
4.0,I had a cold weather motorcycle ride (34¬∞) for 6 hours that I needed heated clothing for to stay warm. This certainly did the job! Heated gear is a game changer! Battery life could be a tad better but you can recharge once at your destination.
4.0,"I love the knitting pattern and yarn on this hat, and the circumference is correct, but my head is much larger than this girl in the picture, and I have very thick hair, so it doesn't fit like this in the back, which is what I wanted - that slouchy look.  If you have thick hair and a big head (23&#34; in my case), then it won't look like this in the back.  It is going to be a good warm hat, though, and it won't be popping off my head like my other hats do.  I think I will like it regardless of the look of the back.  Also, I didn't realize that the back would just be a round circle.  Since I have so much hair, it looks like a bucket on my head. &#60;g&#62;  You will love the feel and the warmth, though, and if you have a smaller head, it will look like the picture."
4.0,"Good product, albeit a bit of a slow delivery."
4.0,The glasses are great. The right lens was scratched when I opened them up.
4.0,FYI the clouds don‚Äôt appear on the back side of the sweatshirt.
4.0,son liked them
4.0,"Comfortable cotton jersey PJ's, but sizing runs a bit small.  Normally wear a size 6 to 8.  Ordered a medium for a looser fit, but medium fits more like a small.  Can wear, but not as loose fitting as I'd prefer for sleepwear."
4.0,Bought for traveling. Looks like it will fill the requirement.
4.0,Looks much brighter in real life. Very functional.
4.0,It's smaller than i expected but other than that it's great ....was delivered on time .....love my new bag
4.0,"This is a solid pair of overalls that feels streamlined and has a balanced fit on me. The length of the pants legs are a little longer than I expected, but the overall fit is solid. The color is a little lighter than in the picture as well. Wit the right shirt and accessories, I can have a lot of fun with this."
4.0,Runs a little small just order a size up ..Nice coat tho really like it.
4.0,Sexiest fricken swimsuit ever! Only reason it lost a star was because the clasps that connect the straps to the back of the suit kept getting loose and unclasping üò≥. I might have shown a few strangers my nipple.....
4.0,This is not a sweat shirt
4.0,"This was a well made top, super cute but waaay too small. Had to return. I‚Äôm a size 12, I ordered xl... wish it came in larger sizes"
4.0,"This top is very cute and the fabric is soft, but it runs small! Get it one or two sizes bigger that you think you need. If you want any kind of oversized look buy two sizes for sure. If you‚Äôre looking for very fitted buy your usual size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 175# and large was fitted on me."
4.0,"I bought three pairs of these. First order I bought the spruce green in med., then order wine and brown. The green fit great, so I ordered another couple pairs. The wine fit great too, the brown fit like a small. Felt like I was pulling on a body shaper and were incredible tight. They were more then likely mismarked at the manufacturer. I had worn and washed them, so instead of returning I gave them to my daughter. I would buy another pair, only try them on before washing so I could return them."
4.0,"Fast shipping, soft material and cute patterns. Good buy!"
4.0,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color.  I have a black bracelet and I love it.  Ordered this color, in the color choice it said rose red.  Thought it would be more red."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter and it is beautiful. Great necklace for the price.
4.0,"Perfect for summer, fabric doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy though it‚Äôs quite thin."
4.0,"Great for the price. Look great in photos and excellent first impression. Here's what you need to know.<br /><br />- The shoes seem to fit to size well but there are some caveats. Some parts may be too tight and you may want to select a half size large if what I describe fits your feet. In the front of the shoe there is an indentation on top of your toes that presses down - that crease area from when you walk. I haven't taken a step and feel it. I like my shoes gripping me and these do that perfect but many prefer a little breathing room.<br /><br />- These are not Timberland and highest quality. You can see immediately they are from China because the cutouts are not perfect as they appear in the photo. For example, the front of the shoe where you have that style light brown lip by the laces. That as well as the stitched area in front look like they were cut by scissor. It's not terrible and certainly not something anyone will notice while wearing the shoes. But I did notice it immediately. There are also some slightly noticeable glue marks - again, upon observation.<br /><br />- After using them for a day, they do break in a little so that the tighter fit does loosen a little. I'd say they are sized consistently.<br /><br />- They are definitely lower in height than I expected. They are more like sneaker / running shoe height at highest.<br /><br />Overall for the money, it's a good buy."
4.0,I bought my dad a Luminox watch two years ago.  The band finally went.  He loves the watch and wears it all the time.  He wasn't so thrilled about the cost of an original band so I found this one.  The band fits well and has a very similar look and feel to the original. He is happy with it.
4.0,Nice boots but not made for slim legs
4.0,I love the shirt üëï  but to big  and I  got a Small too.
4.0,"My fianc√® loves these- the zipper pockets are awesome! Only bummer was the pocket had a slight hole when we got them. We fixed it but still annoying. The shorts fit well, are long but not overly baggy, and are true to size."
4.0,"Blouse is beautigul, well. Photo shows a deep pink. Mine was a lite pink. Problem: I used their size recommendations (M) and its too tight. But my bad. I should know better. I have a swimmer's broad back so I akways go for the XL or XXL. Material (not stated) s hot for Florida's humidity. I gifted the blouse to my petite size sister...goes great with her true ginger hair."
4.0,Great fit. With stretch
4.0,"Super comfy and stretchy. Very soft, slightly big.  They dont provide a very much support, but they are great for sleeping. I might order another pack a size smaller and see if they provide more support. The pad that was in the bra was awful, it slid around all over the place but thankfully they were easy to remove out of the slit provided on the upper inside part off the bar."
4.0,Most comfortable band I have worn yet.
4.0,"Cheap  material, easily  rankled"
4.0,Sizing is off. Much bigger than an XL. Armholes are cut too deep. Shows the bottom of my bra!5
4.0,"I was really excited about these earrings as I love unique designs and materials. But, these were slightly disappointing once I put them on. The metal part is almost sharp, and is just wide enough that on my ears it either needed to be twisted (as shown in the second picture) or turned so that it laid flat against my cheek (as shown in the first picture), kind of pulling my ear back. I think my solution will be to ear them in my second hole, or just wear them tilted. I think they are super cute though and I will try and work around it so I can wear them!"
4.0,"Bought it as a gift for my mother and she loved it! We're not too confident about the material, so she only wears it on occasion."
4.0,I like material is really soft<br />5‚Äô2<br />145 ponds small fits perfect ü§©
4.0,"Love the purse for work, however it is slightly stiff so some paperwork I am unable to place in the bag w/o getting ruined."
4.0,It looks very sleek but I dong think it ticked properly
4.0,Love this dress but I'm 5'7 and it was super duper short. Extremely short. I have to return it because my butt is literally hanging out.
4.0,"Fit was in line with other comments. Child is 7/8 and ordered the 8/10. I would add that my child has a little bit of a butt, and so it was a little loose on the front and rode up in the back."
4.0,True to size! Loved the packaging. Came so nicely. Quality robe!
4.0,It's exactly as advertised but I wish the band was thicker.
4.0,"Bought for my niece, she seemed to like them."
4.0,cute dress. I expected it to be a little bit more lose but overall I loved it. customer service was excellent. The dress came with a tear in the seam. I contacted them and they were quite quick in there response and refunded me.
4.0,"Nice over a tank, it is very sheer so know that you will need to wear something underneath."
4.0,Comfortable material. Fits well. Cute design. Only issue I had were the unevenly placed buttons. It makes my mask look a little wonky but it isn‚Äôt a major con. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt an issue with the other caps I‚Äôve ordered that haven‚Äôt arrived yet.
4.0,It runs about big try down sizing
4.0,Received compliments at work 5'4 goes passed the knee
4.0,Gift for my daughter's birthday.  She like them.
4.0,"Just a pictured, fast delivery, breathable, but a little snug in the neck area but other than that, pretty cool mask."
4.0,The cap and wig duo is actually a nice go to when youre in the middle of a hair appointment or just for a quick run to the store!
4.0,Good pair of glasses for the price
4.0,The fit and drape were great. Color was not what I expected.
4.0,"Great post partum dress. Easy access for nursing, and keeps shape through the day. It does start to pile and becomes see through bit not thread bare by 6 months with regular wear and no special laundry considerations. It is a great seasonal/ temporary item."
4.0,"The watch is light, looks great and keeps time well. The only thing it lacks is the date. Resizing the band was not difficult once I googled for instructions."
4.0,Good polarized glasses with &#34;real&#34; screws to hold the frame together. This is a solid product. If you want that fashionable-professional look while driving to the airport in sunny weather buy Menton Ezil.
4.0,It‚Äôs super comfortable to wear these. They lost one of those metal end caps from the draw string before the first wash. Just from tying them or untying them. Otherwise I‚Äôm very pleased so far.
4.0,"I really like it. The material feels sturdy and thicker than others I have tried, and is generally well made. All I wanted was a plain black cap that fit and that is what I got. My only concern is that it might run a bit big. I bought the 6 7/8, since that is what all my other hats were, but ended up trading for the 6 3/4."
4.0,Good price and does a good job of protecting.  My daughter broke her nose in a basketball game and uses it to protect her nose while it heals.  It does obscure some of your view but it protects when it something hits your face. It did come off once during a rather aggressive basketball game because my daughter did not have the straps tight enough.  It will do the job until we get the $500 custom mask that doesn't block your view. She plans on wearing it for the long run so the custom mask makes good sense.
4.0,"I was skeptical at first because the XS measurement chest seemed a tad small. But just got the SMALL and it is too loose. It is really cute and I might return it for an XS For reference:<br />Height: 5'3""<br />Chest: 32DD<br />Waist: 25.7""<br />Hips: 36"""
4.0,"Fits well, but it's a little bit long....shorter may look better"
4.0,"This BETTE BOUTIK Color Block Top is super cute and fashionable. It has a round neck with leopard detail near the neck and leopard sleeves. It‚Äôs super comfortable too and is made from 60% polyester, 33% cotton and 5% spandex. The fabric is thin, but not see-through.<br /><br />How does it fit?  The fit is just right. I like my shirts a little long and not too fitted. A medium was a perfect fit for me. See my picture for details. Overall, I would recommend the shirt."
4.0,Nice bracelet.. Arrived on time.
4.0,It comes loose frequently. The designs are really cute though
4.0,I love it! It fix how I expected it too!
4.0,"These socks are perfect for our 4 year old daughter with AFO's. They're a little long,but that's actually worked out well as we fold the sock over the top Velcro band so she doesn't mess with it constantly. The price is steep for a pair of socks... but they work perfectly."
4.0,Overall very beautiful && comfy swim wear! The top was a little big but other than that I loved it!
4.0,"They're typical cheap, plastic blue light glasses. Do they actually work? Honestly I have no idea, I think the idea of blue light or anti-glare glasses has been debunked, but I wear them because I think I still get some benefit even if it's just the placebo effect. Plus they're flattering and it means I can skip eye makeup."
4.0,"Even in the heat of summer and wearing black tennis shoes, these socks do not overheat my feet and are comfortable enough that I forget that they are there. These socks are the right thickness for comfort, without being overly thick. Quality is average, but good enough to play sports in. Well-designed and fit right in all areas of the sock. The socks are made from soft flexible textile that is not scratchy. They do the job and will last me for several months. After going through four different brands of socks, this pair ranks average among them. If you're looking for a pair of sport socks that can take heavy use, I recommend these socks for their softness, comfort, and durability."
4.0,"Okay. I say that it is somewhat small, and that is based on the other customer feedback. Because of this, I ordered an XL. I typically wear a medium in Victoria Secret and Target swimsuits. I ordered this for the top and ONLY expected to wear the top. To my surprise, I would have been much better off with the Large. The bottoms are tiny no matter what, so unless you have no fat around the middle, just enjoy this cute top. For reference, I am 5'9, 138 lbs with a 28 or 29&#34; waist. I wear a size 6 and my bra size is a 34C. I can get away with this on the tightest setting for laying out so I will still enjoy it, but for more active wears I would certainly need a size smaller for the top!"
4.0,"I modified them into hospital type gowns. Slit the backs, finished the edges. And put Velcro at the top back for closure. Mom was cared for at home. It was difficult to move her due to pain. These looked great. Made a more natural option to night gowns. Fabric was soft and comfortable."
4.0,"Good Look ,. Nice material"
4.0,The lanyard looks great and functions as expected.  Would have been 5 stars if not a twist that doesn't allow it to lay flat.  If only the Penguins could play as well as this lanyard looks.
4.0,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Really nice quality and the lining is great.
4.0,I went off a review and ordered a medium when I‚Äôm usually an xl... it fit but was a little too tight. I am going to re-order a large and it‚Äôll be perfect. I‚Äôd suggest ordering your regular size or one size down but def not 2 sizes. Especially if you have big boobs!
4.0,"Linen is my favorite material for summer shorts, and these are well made.  I purchased them in gray and green.  The fit is not exactly what I expected, and the shorts fit abbot more snug than I like.  However, being linen, they end up fitting well after a bit of wear, so I am pleased with that."
4.0,"Controllers are flat. Was expecting more rounded. However, I still think they are pretty darn awesome. They are perfect for my husband. Goes with his gamer tie and socks all dressed nicely with his suit for work. Have to have some fun at work somehow."
4.0,I love it. It looks good and fits great.
4.0,Looks great- I get lots of compliments on it..
4.0,I really Love it! These are so nice but the fabric is a little thin so it might rip easly.
4.0,They run a little large.I like the look of it on my 15 month old.
4.0,Very comfortable practical hat.
4.0,"Super cute, but I was hoping for a little more puff in the sleeves lol..."
4.0,Quality is kind of thin but looks exactly like picture
4.0,The only problem I've encountered is that the clip bit will randomly open. It looks so good I almost don't care though.
4.0,"This watch was a sound purchase & it goes with my work suit, quite nicely.  I only took off a star because the fastening mechanism had randomly popped open from time to time, during wear - but overall, that is the only minor thing I've noticed."
4.0,. They aren't close to designer and won't fool anyone. For the price they are a perfectly good pair of sunglasses that can serve until yNice large framed glassesou lose them.
4.0,"For the price, I was surprised by the quality of this cardigan!  It's not as thin as I expected and the fit is expected for the size (other reviews mentioned a size discrepancy, so I ordered up one, but that made it a bit looser than I like).  The color is vibrant -- we'll see if it holds up to a wash, but I'm optimistic at this point.  Overall, a nice, inexpensive piece."
4.0,"Kids loved them, but they totally run small."
4.0,"I like the dress, perfect for spring. It is not great for chuby people like me. It‚Äôs a dress that needs to fit loose."
4.0,Product arrived on time.. Love it nice soft and warm !!!
4.0,The necklace was better than expected. I would have given a 5 but the G for my last name resembles an S and look like MRS
4.0,"Love it! Sleeps great and can be worn out, too!<br />Update: the lace and the seams are sometimes uncomfortable, especially in winter when son tends to be drier and more sensitive."
4.0,The hoodie came in great condition and doesn't get damaged or worn out easily. They held to everything they promised.
4.0,"The style on these looks very good, I got a small and it is just a little bigger on me. Didn't fit the way I wanted but over all it is a good buy."
4.0,Super soft and comfy. They seem to run pretty tts. I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant and ordered one size up and they fit comfortably. Planning to wear these post partum also. I was disappointed these did not have the lace accent pictured since that was the whole reason I ordered this particular pair. Other then that no complaints.
4.0,Very fitted.. and I like my clothes snug. I ordered up
4.0,"This band is super cute! I really love how it looks and it's very fashionable. For $13 the quality is good, but I would not recommend wearing it daily. I had it on for about 4 weeks before noticing some very minor wear had started to appear. If you do wear it daily, my guess is it'll last about half a year."
4.0,Sizing is a little smaller than expected
4.0,I like the product keeps my face dry in the gym.<br />Prior to purchasing them face would be drenched with sweat.
4.0,Liked the lining/pad that came w it. Runs a bit on the small size: the triangles could provide a bit more side coverage.
4.0,Really like the watch but wish the red color had been a little deeper red color.  Would just match my Husker shirts better as I personally just like the darker shades of red myself when I buy things that are red.
4.0,"Ordered 2, one medium, one large, prefer large; 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 104 lbs, small breasted"
4.0,"Super adorable. There was a tear in the plastic area that covers the small zipper pouch. Bummed about that. But overall, everything else checked out."
4.0,"Nice color, heavier than a regular compact umbrella.  Opens and closes as advertised.  I have not used in the wind yet,"
4.0,"Its lovely and colorful but the more you stare, the more flaws you see. However for the price I think its decent. Its not too fancy which makes it nice for a dressed up daily look or costume. Gifting this to a beautiful friend who wears similar jewelry daily, it will definitely light up her gorgeous face. The shame of this is that they sent it wrapped in bubble wrap inside a small bag. I wish it was in a presentable box for storage or gifting, although its practical as shipped."
4.0,"Nice dress. Purchased in black and bust area seems a bit see through. Dress is also not as long as I would like-but I am 5'10"" and usually require a tall. Overall, I am pleased and will keep for work and casual wear."
4.0,Nice product but sometimes slides off my ears and nose.  I like them-
4.0,I bought 2 pairs. They fit good and seem durable.
4.0,"These are basic drugstore reading glasses, so don't expect fine optical quality glass lenses. Where they excel, is the flip up feature, a feature I've been searching for for some time. No more leashes, sliding glasses up on your forehead, or putting them off and on, off and on. I've been using them for about a month, and so far they have held up well. Theyvome with a wipe and a pouch, both microfiber. One downside is shipping time, as they come by muletrain directly from... guess where!"
4.0,Love the dress. Ordered a medium. Was a little big in the bust with a padded bra. I will try a small next time. Im 5'4 and hits just above just below my ankle. No dragging.
4.0,"Arms 2&#34; too long, even turned up."
4.0,"Like these, though the narrow lens is super narrow so be ready for that.  Would be better with silver frames but what can ya do?"
4.0,"This shirt is identical in fit and style to a much cheaper Hanes shirts.  Narrow in the hip (I ordered 1x, which should fir 44-46"" hips, but this is barely 44"" at the hips), and long in the arms.  Still a nice shirt.  I might order it again, since the Hanes dies not come in a scoop neck (which I prefer)"
4.0,"Great value (5 to a pack). Sure these are not the sturdiest ponchos, but I would expect to pay more for heavy duty ponchos. These worked perfect for a trip to Orlando theme parks. Used when it rained hard 2 afternoons. What I loved best is that they were individually packaged so everyone could keep their own poncho and they took up nearly no space at all! An unexpected plus was the ziplock pouch that all the ponchos came in. This came in handy to hold our theme park tickets so they didn't get wet! If you're planning to use these more than once or twice, I recommend either buying more or buying heavier duty ponchos. These are more like a light trash bag in weight. Still they worked for us."
4.0,"Like this item ,I wear it last September 2019 for my birthday .and I receive it before my Birthday thank you,!"
4.0,Like it and wear it a lot
4.0,The embroidery is dazzling!  It looks so great against the chambray fabric. I am so glad I chose this.
4.0,It fits ok could be a little bigger but will have to do. I‚Äôm using it for captains dinner in Jamaica
4.0,"I used this for the face-part of my Cthulu costume (painted them green) - they got here just in time, but was a little bummed to see that the order was only for 1 hand... turned out okay in my case, but could have been a disaster if they were for my actual hands and needed to match... buy 2 if you want all 10 fingers!"
4.0,"I have never found these gloves to be uncomfortable; however, I often slide it from my thumbs to interact with my phone."
4.0,The dress is really great. The bag was heavily used as my daughter liked it so much and the seams ripped
4.0,"Not bad. Kinda a cheap feel to it, but maybe it's due to the plastic lenses ( I am used to Ray Ban glass lenses). Fits good and looks just like my Ray Bans. Good as a spare."
4.0,These were very easy and simple to apply. Unfortunately the color was a bit grainy and faded. All in all from a distance you cannot tell and I would recommend due to its ease of application.
4.0,I love how they look and feel. Not a thick sock. I just wish there wasn't a toe line.
4.0,The bands look nice.
4.0,"I received my item super quick. I'm usually a 7.5 and got a 7. These shoes were still too big, especially being wide in the toe box. I recommend an entire size down from your normal size. I got the blush and thought it would look cute, but it's more of a leather blush than a satin finish blush like I had thought. Therefore it washed me out since I'm pretty pale. It's still a good shoe and I would recommend it overall."
4.0,Great fabric.  Material is not see through.  You don't need a slip.  The waistline  is above my waist.  Fits like an empire waist.  I'm 5ft 11/2 inches .  The dress drags the floor.  It's still too long with 4 in heels.  I would order a smaller size!
4.0,The top runs small cup wise. The bottom runs bigger then most.
4.0,Beautiful dress but too large.
4.0,"I liked that it was adjustable, although my granddaughter is graduating public school she has tiny wrists."
4.0,"Great waterproof case!  I haven't dropped it in water or anything, but it is very sealed in there.  I listen to audio books and music a lot on my phone and it does sound a little echoy... Yes I made that word up. It is difficult to get the covers off of the earbud hole and charger port. I don't mind it and though BC I know it is really safe for my phone.  These two reasons are the only ones I have for not giving it 5 stars."
4.0,Great fit. I bought these for a barre fusion class and they are great protection for the higher impact moves. Only thing I wish is that the grip on the bottom of the sock was also on the toe area.
4.0,"Sweet looking, a bit closely knit.... WILL CREASE if bent with pressure."
4.0,The pieces all look fancy and beautiful. Some people commented that the colors are not identical but I believe it looks better when the gloves are slightly different in color. The only problem I faced so far is the touch screen parts of the gloves stopped working after a couple of use.
4.0,Amazing set. Took quite a while to get were but it actually fits so I don't mind too much. The Orange color isn't very sweat proof -also wouldn't suggest going commando- (if you know what I'm saying)
4.0,I liked the belt but it did not hold up well.  The Velcro started pulling away from the belt. Only used for 2 weeks.
4.0,"Its really cute, looks just as it is in the pictures. The lace up back is really a nice touch. It runs pretty true to size just be warned it is a little short. I usually get an XL tank top and they come down mid waist area (so they're long enough to tuck in if I want) but I can't with this one. It hits at the top of my jeans. Other then that it's cute and a perfect top for a renaissance faire outfit in you dont want to wear a corset."
4.0,"Love this material and dress length. I am 5'10"" so it can be hard to find longer dresses and this was perfect."
4.0,"You get what you pay for.  It is adorable and perfect for a little girl.  I thought it would be nice for my teen, but in person it just looks more like little girl jewelry.  It seems pretty durable though."
4.0,"These socks easily come to the knees, they do provide mild support which is still enough to prevent swelling and aching legs after a 12.5 hour shift.  I wish you could order them in varying compressions because I typically order medium 15-20mmHg compression and it is what I like, but I am unable to order these cute socks with more compression."
4.0,This is a lovely ring but seems to run small. I usually wear a size 7 and the ting did not fit. I liked it so much I ordered it in a size 8. I have become allergic to sterling silver so I love stainless steel jewelry it's beautiful and lasts forever.
4.0,"Dress is very stretchy, flowy, and comfortable. The pockets are great and the cut of the waist is very flattering. I'm ordering a few different colors!<br /><br />I ordered 2 sizes just in case and while both fit (thanks to the stretchy fabric) the larger one was less see-through. I would definitely recommend nude undergarments or a slip with this dress."
4.0,gift for my daughter - so far no raving compliments or complaints - so I guess it met expectations
4.0,"I bought this to go with a maxi dress of the same color so my straps will blend in with the dress. I haven't found a good strapless bra so this was my solution. I wear a 36B and ordered the Medium. The cup doesn't cover as much as I would prefer but it's not a big deal. The band itself is very tight so I feel like it's a bit hard to breath compared to my other bras that are similar. The spaghetti straps themselves just hold the bra in place, but offer no support. If you are looking for a bra with more support from the straps then this is not for you. It is labeled as a low impact bra for this reason. I plan on wearing it under a maxi dress with thin spaghetti straps of the same color so this bra offers me some support without going strapless and without making the bra straps stand out against my dress."
4.0,Larger than most 3X sweat shirts.
4.0,"The fabric doesn't have much give, I ended up with a huge camel toe. The bottom goes somewhat too low in the back too. The fabric and color are very nice and I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the camel toe. I definitely recommend sizing up."
4.0,"Quality seems good. Looks great. Got multiple compliments at work the first day I wore it. Definitely need to order one size larger. I typically buy large shirts and they fit either good or a little big. This feels almost like a medium. It's OK now, but afraid after a few washes will be too tight.  I ordered an extra large in a different color and out that fits perfectly."
4.0,Pretty cheap feeling but looks nice. Gave this as a gift to my father from my daughter for Christmas and he absolutely loved it
4.0,a little smaller than i thought  -but it was great!
4.0,This product works well but I have only a few days experience with it.  The problem I have had with similar products is that the adhesive fails to hold the sizing foam in place.
4.0,"I wear size 14 for my tops and 12 for my pants. I ordered this tunic in size L, and it is somewhat large. I can still wear it, but I may take it in and make it fit better. It is a bit longer than I expected, but not too long. I can wear it well with tighter pants. I think I am going to order size M next time.<br /><br />The fabric is the typical T-shirt material, but of a very good quality. It is dense and it has a good feel to it. This is the first time I buy a Romans product, but I think I am going to give it another try for a size smaller. Yes, the reviewers that suggested buying two sizes smaller are right. Also, following the size chart is also safe.<br /><br />Oh, the product arrived very quickly with Prime Amazon."
4.0,I like these batteries but they just don't work right with my Hubsan H 501 but great in all my other Drones!!!
4.0,Nicely made but not impressed by appearance of it.
4.0,"Very cute, modest swimsuit! It was great at covering a post-baby tummy that hasn't seen the gym in a long time! The fit was good everywhere, except the bottom seemed a little small in the back."
4.0,Stiff but besides that good!
4.0,"This product was provided to me at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This in no way impacts my opinion.<br /><br />I'm trying to pick up some summer dresses; it's too warm where I am to wear jeans year-round, and I don't like shorts. This one looked cute, so I decided to try it. I got it with Prime, so shipping was quick, although the dress arrived horribly wrinkled and with an odd smell that reminded me of my grandmother's attic. Nothing that washing won't resolve. There is a small stain on the collar, which will hopefully also be solved with a wash, although it's pretty unnoticeable anyway.<br /><br />The dress itself is as it appears in the picture, although I got the sky blue and it was more grey than I expected. Probably a monitor difference. I normally wear a small or medium, but I ordered a large. It fits fairly well overall; it's a bit loose in the chest, so be aware if you're flat chested you may need some substantial padding. The fabric is a plain flat weave with a bit of stretch, and there were some loose threads but not an excessive amount. I have not yet had a chance to check on its durability. I'm 5'10 and it comes to mid knee. The waistband is a touch higher than I expected, but that's the style, so not faulting it. Docking a star for the stained collar and slightly cheap feeling fabric."
4.0,"Skirt is not lined, so the material is completely see-through. Can easily be fixed with a slip or liner worn underneath. Other than that, it is beautiful and well made."
4.0,Its simple and fits perfect! Love it
4.0,"Looks exactly as pictured, is very light but still seems to be sturdy enough to withstand daily wear. I‚Äôve already had multiple compliments on it! Only complaint is that the beads hurt if they are pressed into my wrist but that‚Äôs a really minor concern."
4.0,"This dress has a modest and classic look. The fabric has a nice stretch to it although all day wear there was wrinkles. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and thickness of the dress, great for the price. I will probably order again in another color. The only reason I didn't give this dress five stars was because the darts sewn in on bust line were bubbled and after ironing still would not lay flat. However, if wearing a sweater it is not noticeable. I'm 5'5 and it came just below my knees."
4.0,Dress fit well and was very comfy. It stretched which made it really comfortable.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that the design was printed on the fabric so after a few washes it will start to fade.
4.0,"love the look and size, but a seem already was separating. I repaired it and works fine now."
4.0,"Ordered a Medium. I am 5‚Äô3, normally ~140lbs, currently 175lbs at 37wks pregnant. The fit is snug but i hate loose fitting nightgowns so this was perfect for me. it tends to rise as i walk, but i am rocking a huge belly and not really flat in the back, so im hoping once im back to normal body, that gets better. I bought this for delivery and healing time (c-section mommy) so it fits the occasion well!"
4.0,I like these leggings. They dont chafe or pill and are completely squat proof. Like that it stays on the waist area and hugs the body. They also have a nice compression feel which I look for in leggings. Will update if anything arises.
4.0,The fit is a bit off but I still really like this tee.
4.0,Fit nicely everywhere but at the top of the leg.
4.0,I like this scarf. It's sheer. and it goes pretty well with simple shirts at everyday work. However it's not the best choice for parties or glamorous events. It's just good for everyday use. Also it takes forever to receive it. But it totally worth it!
4.0,"Thought it looked better online, but it‚Äôs comfy"
4.0,wish material was softer
4.0,The product fit like another dress I have bought from this exact same Amazon listing however the material was not very ‚Äúblack‚Äù it just looked dingy and washed out like a dark charcoal so I feel like it made it look more cheap than my actual other dress that I have from this listing
4.0,"I love how it looks; and it has a very nice band. The movement ticks pretty loudly and loses more time than a Timex. The Lum doesn't last through the night, and despite the swiss luminous claim, it is about half that of a Citizen. It is a good addition to a modest collection but would recommend the other two aforementioned brands for someone looking for an all-purpose affordable watch."
4.0,"This necklace came on time, its great and all but it doesnt tell you the color is not cream, its yellow. Durable, but totally wrong color"
4.0,Small dainty for a layered look!
4.0,This product looks as describes. It is heavy and wears well.
4.0,Love the top but it was too big.  I gave it to a friend who loves it.
4.0,"I really like this tunic, but it is too open on the neck. The V is too deep. I will have to do some alteration to wear it like in the picture."
4.0,"The dress fits perfectly. It's pretty and the length is excellent.  However,  it's  very thin; both the lace lining and the under lining.  I need a slip on to keep it from being so revealing."
4.0,"Buen material suave, buenas terminaciones"
4.0,Looks elegant I love it
4.0,The dress fit very well. I received a lot of compliments at the wedding I attended. I ordered it on Tuesday and received it on Friday.
4.0,Fits fine. Material very light.
4.0,"The shape is a squarish rectangle, which you may not guess from the image of the item. I like the colors."
4.0,"Very Pretty, Simple Stud Earrings."
4.0,To small and flimsy for price
4.0,"I'm glad I read other comments...I ordered a size bigger than I thought I would need, but it is just barely big enough.  But it is really nice quality."
4.0,"Should have ordered a large, instead of extra large.  Nice material and color.  I would buy again."
4.0,"Sooo I‚Äôve ordered this skirt once awhile back (black) and it‚Äôs still my fave! It‚Äôs so full and long and I‚Äôm always complimented on it, no matter the season. This time I ordered the skirt in white for my praise team. I ordered the same size (2 sizes bigger than my usual) and it wasn‚Äôt as long, just hitting my ankle. And it was so sheer. I‚Äôm grateful we had to wear white leggings beneath to dance but I was hoping to wear it again with a different combo. It‚Äôs still a pretty skirt but not what expected."
4.0,"I love these glasses, I have an all black pair and wanted to get another color. I ordered what I thought were bright yellow frames (they definitely look very yellow in the picture) but they ended up being gold, so I am returning them."
4.0,"Wearing these ice fishing, I never get cold. Very nice bibs, the only downfall for me is no pockets for your hands in these."
4.0,Cute set of durable wristbands for basketball and Kobe fans. Comfortable and stylish to wear
4.0,"great shelf bra for practice suit.  might like size smaller but my 36ddd  fit great<br />it DOES get bigger  buyng size smaller as a second  practice suit  love coverage  BUT do not buy 2 sizes smaller, cant get it on to start.."
4.0,I loved that it actually stayed in place. The adhesive was very sticky and I had no problems with it moving or shifting through the evening. I wore it with a backless dress and it was not visible. Highly recommend for busty women too.
4.0,"I was hesitant to order this, but my daughter really wanted it. At the time, there were two different sizes in inches in the description. So that set off alarm bells.  However,  I was pleasantly surprised. It was really sturdy for the price.  My daughter loved it."
4.0,"This is a pretty cute set of t-shirts and they fit my 7-year-old perfectly. She loves the cartoony little illustrations and the soft pastel colors. I do think there was a little lost in translation moment happening with the bird t-shirt because the text on it says ""Don't Sick."" Unless that's means something now...? But she thinks the bird is cute anyway and doesn't mind the somewhat confusing words. The quality of the material feels nice as well, very soft."
4.0,Very nice shirt. Too thick for summer but will be nice for fall/winter. If you‚Äôre torn between two sizes I‚Äôd recommend going smaller rather than larger because the medium fit me more loosely than I‚Äôd like. Still a very pretty top for a cute and casual look.
4.0,These leggings were a good fit
4.0,Super soft and comfortable.  Orders two more in different colors right away.  Fits just right
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ce6eed3d7b263238903d72541af2b0e8]] This product is well crafted and feels sturdy. Though I thought the wood was garnished (shine), it is not but I Love it. Has a natural look to it. The packaging was also very presentable."
4.0,You can‚Äôt get a better deal  it‚Äôs not a G watch  but it looks good feels good and so far it works great would recommend to buy for the money
4.0,"The wristband looks great, and the magnet closure is easy to use and feels sturdy. Comfortable to wear. I will probably order a second one in a different color and regular width."
4.0,Perfect size for a tween to carry a phone! Color was a lot darker than expected even after viewing on phone app and laptop screens. Overall happy with the product for the price.
4.0,Love the design; its just like the ones in the show. Right when I put mine on I felt like I was aboutta hit Mach 2 lol
4.0,I received a discount to give my unbiased review of these shirts I purchased for my husband. The quality of the shirts are good; cotton. Good stitching. They are form fitting shirts ment to show your physique. Well they showed his body well....all smiles...however they were just a lil too tight in the arms. I really like the look on him but I couldn't give 5 stars because it cost more to send back and get the next size (XX)which would be too big. If my son can fit them and look just as awesome (slightly smaller) than I'll update to 5 stars and change my status from bummed to happy
4.0,Good enough for three sunglasses and also for traveling.
4.0,Cute and comfy. Fits rather large.
4.0,"Size Medium - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The medium fits nice. The sweater is on the thinner side but it's still nice considering a price of $16. The sweater has dropped shoulders and is nice and roomy. You could probably size down depending on the fit you desire. I love the color combination. The sweater did arrive with a bit of the chemical smell, but it dissipated after washing. I machine wash in a laundry bag and drip dry. 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! Love the colors! I intentionally wore a black bra underneath so you could see the degree of thinness! Has an itchy tag - I'm going to cut my off!"
4.0,So far I like the sun glasses. For the most part they are comfortable and they look good.
4.0,"These masks are great.  They are light, 100% cotton, which means they breathe and don't get sweaty.  They take a filter, which I always use when going out to the store.  My face and head are small so they are still a trifle large, but work quite well."
4.0,It‚Äôs a mans hat and it fits my head pretty tight. I guess I expected it to have a little more room. It‚Äôs very warm though
4.0,"I love this dress! It goes well with boots. I gave it only 4 stars because it has an odd unfinished look. There‚Äôs no seam or stitching whatsoever on the collar. It reminds me of when I cut tshirts myself. Looks good with a necklace to distract from that. The sleeves are nice and long, which is a rare thing!"
4.0,"These are thin, light weight bandanas. I had neck surgery and had stitches on my neck and behind my ears so I needed something that would pull on my ears or neck. They were perfect for that."
4.0,Despite saying non branded they are. They have each house's words(ex: hear me roar) on one side and family name. House Stark's said &#34;Winter Coming&#34; which is highly annoying since they're my favorite.<br />Slightly heavier than expected.
4.0,Fits great and is quite sexy.
4.0,"Quality is good, not exceptional, but perfectly functional - kept me clothed and cool during hot/humid riding conditions.  The bottom 'huggy' fit seems a little odd when first put on, but has never bothered me while riding."
4.0,Worked well for my horses Halloween costume
4.0,They came LATE. and the noise pieces are alil crooked. BUT I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ON THEM
4.0,"I get lots of compliments on this cowl sweater with buttons. It definitely runs SMALL, so the sleeves are a bit short and it's not long enough to wear with leggings (I'm only 5'3 so it's not that I'm overly tall). But I would still buy it again. It's a great casual piece to have."
4.0,"These were surprisingly decent neckties. The pocket squares are really just decretive though, I wouldn't really expect to get anything else other than aesthetics out of them. I ordered these for myself and my groomsmen, they worked out great. They looked pretty on-point for all the dudes. I would still wear this tie for important occasions. BEST of all, it's budget friendly."
4.0,Really like the look of them
4.0,"This item is very nice, a little bit heavy but looks great. It's very resistant, I usually take a shower with it totally stainless steel.<br />Highly recommend it."
4.0,"Gonna try shrinking, it came in kinda big. But I love it! So I‚Äôm hoping shrinking it will do the trick!"
4.0,Loved the rings. Although they turned rather quickly.
4.0,nice top if I was tiny. loved the lace on the sleeves. But it was way to small
4.0,Added just the right touch to my flapper costume
4.0,"I‚Äôm usually an xl and I ordered the biggest size and it was a little snug. Luckily I‚Äôve been on a weight loss journey so I‚Äôm not too worried but I would size up if possible. Waist band is definitely snug. The colors are awesome though! I ordered the pink, black and orange combo and they are as vibrant as they are shown"
4.0,Absolutely huge. Covers the majority of my face. Would be great if they were not so big.
4.0,Watch lasted about 14 years so far.
4.0,Durable material and always on time.
4.0,It's good. Easy to use.
4.0,"Like the skirt, but it was too short and a little too tight.  I wanted an XL, but that size was not available."
4.0,Don't order if you have big boobs! Nice quality. I usually wear a medium or large. Ordered a XXL based on reviews & it completely smashed my boobs but fit everywhere else.
4.0,I bought this as a gift overall it was what I wanted however the length is too short.  I bought it for my son cause of the game he likes.  He loves but can't wear it so he has it hanging up just wish he could actually wear it.
4.0,This coat kept me very warm in Chicago. Worth the money.
4.0,"These were for my grandsons in Minneapolis. They wear them a lot but my daughter says they are to short to come inside the collars of their winter coats. These boys are 5 & 6, so a few inches would help."
4.0,I loved the smaller shalinda the way it looked on me but a little tight on the sleeves so I had to order the bigger size. It looked ok. Thank you for delivering it in time.
4.0,"These feel like butter. Amazing quality and I wish I could keep them, however, I‚Äôm about 6ft tall so these hit more than half way up my calf! I got them in a small and the waist fit great, it was just the length that was bad.  I don‚Äôt recommend them if your over 5‚Äô9 probably. For the short girls, you are so lucky to get to wear these!! Also this navy color is a lot lighter in person, still cute though."
4.0,"This is very pretty and very comfortable. It seems to run a bit large but it's so comfortable the larger size hasn't been that big of a deal. It still fits well enough. I think a size smaller would probably give you a little more of a figure flattering look though. However, this material just flows so well, is so light weight, and looks so nice you can hardly go wrong.<br />This has a lace applique front, is sleeveless, has a scoop neck, and can really be worn with just about anything in so many different types of outings (or when staying in). It looks great with jeans, leggings, and even the right skirts. It's versatile and oh so nice. I like this a lot."
4.0,these look nice. not bad for a cheap pair of earrings.
4.0,"Wife and my 8yr old daughter loved it. Perfect for their yoga workout.  I will buy more for them.  Since it's also good use for men, I'll try it on our skiing trip and see how it works.  Highly Recommended!"
4.0,Cute! A little bit bigger than expected.
4.0,"This is not the atypical Polo shirt. Collar does not lay correctly. The material feels odd as well, almost like a heavier lingerie material, or a very limp cheese cloth material. I personally do not like the feeling of the material, and it stains very easily. The fabric is semi-porous.<br /><br />While the pattern is like a inexpensive polo, the material is not suited for a Polo shirt at all. Far too soft, limp, and blow up with the winds. It looks better at a distance. Clean the shirt right away of it gets stained with food as the material soaks it up like a sponge."
4.0,"Love it!  Thought it would be a little longer, but it's so comfy!"
4.0,I expected inside where bills go wouldve been leather also but still very sleek an ideal for a minimal wallet
4.0,"It is adorable.  However, I have very small wrists and it was difficult for me to get on.  Perhaps a little more give in the bracelet would be in order."
4.0,Nice chemise. A little long.
4.0,The pink color is soft . v the sleeves are three quartet length!!!
4.0,the fit for the waist is fine but its length is just a tiny bit short but overall a good purchase and they look pretty dam cool.
4.0,"I wouldn't count on these for protection.  But for scenarios where exposure (either way) is limited but a mask is required or gives someone else comfort, these are good to have.  Not much more expensive than disposables and these have held up to a couple wash cycles.<br /><br />They are one layer and thin.  But soft, comfortable and the teenage daughter likes the color choices.  For us it worked out to be a good purchase."
4.0,Very speedy delivery
4.0,It is mini and nice. I returned one because that was too hard to open. This time I fine a tip to open and close it easily. You need to put your finger right at this place! Then it will be very easy to open and close.
4.0,"I love these glasses, there're very nice, wear them all the time. But there're much bigger then i was expecting. they aren't tiny like typical hippie glasses but they are really nice."
4.0,I ordered a large and I definitely could have worn a medium. Very cute shorts!
4.0,Good service and was just what I wanted.  Thanks
4.0,I loved it I was the light of the party It got nicely quality is good Had a slight problem with adjusting but that may be due to my hair extensions. It‚Äôs really nice and appears as shown Pretty color i have all 3
4.0,These aren't a bad deal. The lenses change easily and the case is really nice and sturdy as are the glasses. The string isn't attached all that well to the rubber ends that connect to the glasses but that can be replaced. They fit well and remain snugly in place.
4.0,Sweater showed up as expected.
4.0,It's pretty but a weird material.
4.0,Overall the item was comfortable .
4.0,This is such a cute little coverup!  It's exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"My feet size us 10 so technically I should get medium however I gotten the large instead and I'm glad I got the large size. It fits just nice, can't imagine if it were medium."
4.0,I like it. That's saying alot- as I am picky! I am 6' 180 I ordered (laerg 42) I think it may have just shrunk in the dryer..Recommend cold water wash/ woolite line or flat drying or dry on low heat to avoid shrinkage issues
4.0,Fits well and has nice material. This is a good riding jacket.
4.0,Was a lil big. But super soft and comfy
4.0,Cute leggings. The ankles aren‚Äôt as tight as other leggings and the print doesn‚Äôt look as nice after a few washings. The stitching is seeming to hold up well and they are comfortable.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, fashionable key fob. Easy to add and remove keys to they ring, and it is strong enough so you don't have to worry about your keys falling off."
4.0,"Great work dress!  I needed to have it shortened (it came at least a few inches below my knee), but I'm 5'3 and used to that:)"
4.0,"Fabric is plush and beautiful.  Dress itself felt two sizes too large.  I'm 5'8"" and about 125 lbs and purchased the x- small.  It hangs fine simply based in the weight of the fabric but an xx-small would drfinitely fit tighter.  The hem is also higher than I expected and hits right above my ankle.  Beautiful dress regardless- ill just probably have to take in the waist."
4.0,good quality just didn't like the line thread on the shirt
4.0,"This is wonderful!  Fits just as expected and nice quality for the price,  I am very happy."
4.0,My husband got this purse for me. For mother's day and I absolutely love it! My only complaint is that the decorative chain is made of too cheap of materials as it has already broken (Mother's Day was just 3 days ago).
4.0,Size is way too big but quality seems to be ok
4.0,"The shirt is satiny in a way that feels synthetic and plasticy.  It looks nice, though.  The colors are vibrant, and the buttons are nice.  It fits as expected."
4.0,"The hem is crooked on the red one I ordered.  It's an inch longer on one side.  I'm returning it.  Fit and color is good.  It's flattering and comfortable.<br />Update:  Jut received the second one.  It's perfect.  Straight hem, beautiful purple color, I love it.  Definite keeper."
4.0,"Could have come with matching stud, even if plain. I attach it to a pair of my own, which works really well!  A beautiful piece."
4.0,Love the fit of this suit and definitely does what it is supposed to. Only reason for 4 stars is that one of my straps began to fray after a couple of washes. Would expect it to stay in tact longer for the price.
4.0,"My son really likes this sweatshirt with one exception - the pocket. It is a top loader, so you can't put your hands in it. He still likes it a lot because it looks good and is super comfortable. He just wishes it had the normal muff-style hand pocket. Overall, this is a good product."
4.0,Light weight durable. Also makes you look and feel like a body builder
4.0,"Great hat, but the issue is with the brim letting in light. It needs a piece of fabric on under the brim like traditional hats to block the light. I have to wear sunglasses with the hat to block the white glare coming through hat."
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 140lbs and it fits perfectly.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  Definitely worth it."
4.0,"Overall, I think the outfit is very good but, the top is very short and I‚Äôm only 11, so I don‚Äôt wear it a lot."
4.0,"My daughter saw this on Pinterest, and of course it was styled really cute by the stylist. Falls a little flat compared to the pic but obviously has the potential when styled right. Very itchy, so wear long sleeves under. Fits sufficiently oversized - it‚Äôs supposed to be a little slouchy. Cute sweater, for sure."
4.0,Nice bodysuit. Great fit on torso doesn‚Äôt right up short
4.0,"Bought them while they where on sale. I was very pleased. Fit was as expected, as was color. They are great quality and wick moisture well. They also washed nicely. I like how they fit so well I bought two sets."
4.0,es muy lindo de buena calidad a mi esposo le encant√≥ llego a tiempo gracias
4.0,ARRIVED IN GREAT CONDITION. THANKS
4.0,Works to an extent mask wearing it'll still give you some fogging though.
4.0,One cent + S&H. I wasn't expecting much. More curious than anything else.  It was actually pretty nice. No it isn't beautiful but it was nice enough to give to someone special who had lost a loved one. I don't know if the chain that came with it will turn green. I just know it touched the heart of a special lady.
4.0,"This Benchmark Basics Leather Watchband is made of oil-tanned crazy horse leather. The band is made with a 2-piece construction with each piece being double-layered, with a thickness of 2.7mm and color-matched stitching.<br /><br />I used this watchband with my Fossil 5 Gen Garrett Smartwatch and the 22mm band worked perfectly with my watch. The Fossil ships with a black silicone band but when I want to dress up my watch I prefer a classic, black leather band. This one from Benchmark Basics looks great against a backdrop of formal or business casual attire.<br /><br />What I liked most about this Benchmark Basics watchband was that it came with the watchband pins and spring bar tool needed to install the band. Also, as mentioned previously, the band looks great. Finally, this watchband fits my rather large wrist. I have other watchbands that don't fit my wrist very well and it makes wearing them painful. This watchband fits as good as it looks.<br /><br />What I liked least about the Benchmark Basics watchband was that it didn't have a quick-release mechanism. There may be some who grew up in an era where people bought watches and changed their bands frequently however, most of us today want the convenience of simply sliding bands in and out of place. I deducted a full point from my overall review for Benchmark Basics holding onto a now antiquated fastening mechanism. Implementing a pushpin that controls the spring on one end of a watch pin is the new norm. Benchmark Basics should have adopted this fastening mechanism.<br /><br />Overall, this Benchmark Basics leather watchband has quality construction, looks great and fits comfortably. The glaring weakness of this watchband is that there is no quick-release mechanism for installing/uninstalling the individual straps. If you're versed in installing watchbands with a traditional fastening mechanism then there's no reason to reconsider purchasing this watchband. However, if you're like me and find it a learning experience each time you have to get the band on and off you want to consider an option that installs and releases a bit easier."
4.0,Buy the xl if you're tall. I'm 5'11 160# and they fit like they're suppose to.
4.0,"Was a little smelly upon removal, but there is a sticker that says the smell will go away after 2 showers. No big deal. It is nothing too fancy, just simple hard foam-like shoes. They have little cleat-like circles underneath to grip the floor."
4.0,Sexy club dress - hubby loves it!! Very forgiving with a slimming look
4.0,"I originally got this top,  in another color,  from a different seller,  and the fit was perfect.  When I ordered this top I assumed the fit would be the same...it wasn't.  While it's not bad, it IS a bit smaller than the other brand."
4.0,"The shirt was cute, however, there was a very noticeable blemish in the middle of the decal on the front. I'm returning and have asked for a replacement last week. Have not received the replacement yet. Size medium.<br />UPDATE- I received my replacement shirt and it is in perfect condition."
4.0,perfect  loved them
4.0,I love the fit and comfort of these but the material is very thin and pills easily as in the second time I'm wearing them there are pills though I washed on gentle and laid them flat to dry.
4.0,"After wash the shingled ends got pretty tangled and there  were strings that were starting to pull from the kimono. It served it's purpose tho, nicely priced during my time of need."
4.0,I thought these would be a little larger than they are but they are cute
4.0,"Very good...helps keep phone safe from damage..simple and pretty soft rose gold, not so shiny"
4.0,The release is a lil small
4.0,"I love these earrings!!! I bought them for my daughter who is 4, I actually like it for myself."
4.0,"Wore this to a party and received a lot of compliments. It is a very cute dress.  I'm 5.2 and 180lbs and I purchased a large.  The material is somewhat thin so I got a large because I wanted to be able to wear the proper undergarments without making the fit uncomfortable.  The only reason why I didn't give this a higher rating was because there's no way to ""hide"" the stomach area. Otherwise it's super cute and can be work at church, work or out on a date."
4.0,"Great watch for the price. Band is stiff out of the box, but it looks well beyond the price"
4.0,The sewing wasn't all that great but for the price I can overlook that - fits as expected and looks nice...
4.0,"I bought these for my tween daughter for Christmas.  She likes them enough, but I didn‚Äôt get the assortment pictured.  Not sure if it was a mistake or if you just get a random assortment but they were so inexpensive that it‚Äôs not a big deal.  They do seem rather flimsy which is to be expected but I think they‚Äôre a good quality for the price."
4.0,"Soft, great pattern. Runs a little small"
4.0,"I bought it to wear with leggings but it is a little too long for that 5'2""."
4.0,"Great quality! Cute styles! Reasonable prices!<br /> Good fit, except I am 5'6 and didn't read the length (31&#34;) . It was really too short as a dress but would be great over leggings.<br />Returned it for another style that was 39&#34; long. Then ordered another dress...and a pair of shoes! Only gave it four stars because I have to send it back.<br />BTW, I am 128lbs and the dress was comfortable but not oversized."
4.0,The glasses were a gift but the person did like them!!!
4.0,"I was unsure at first because the price was so reasonable, after my first 16 hour shift, I knew I spent my money well. They are saving my feet and legs. I plan to buy more"
4.0,worked wonderfully
4.0,Very pretty but you would have to have a pencil neck for this to fit. But other than that a nice piece of jewelry.
4.0,"For the price, not bad. Timely shipping and neatly packaged. Included were a (funky white) case, small cleaning cloth and glasses. I'm not sure the various models offered, but mine are a clear plastic lens with light weight metal frame.The lenses are surprisingly large, a tad larger than even my regular glasses (52s-ish?) (which is fine by me for using with computer), and the scrip (2.25) seems pretty accurate.  That said, I'm not convinced these are as treated as they are claimed to be. My normal glasses have a blue light treatment and do a noticeably better job than these, so I'm not particularly impressed in that department. Overall though, they have a nice range of vision, are lightweight, and don't look terrible. For $13 I'm happy, 4 stars."
4.0,These shorts are the cutest! The ruffles aren't over pronounced so they can easily be dressed up or down. They fit very nicely and are much softer than I expected. Very excited to add these to my wardrobe.
4.0,Awesome. Fits well. Stretchy and hides all flaws. I wish they had provided a better belt though. The cloth belt does not look that great.
4.0,it dident look like the picture but theystill look cool and shade well from th sun.
4.0,They were what I expexted
4.0,They're REALLY hard to get into. Super snug. Have to wear a super thin sock in order to fit. Good for the price but I would recommend ordering a 1/2 size - 1 full size up.
4.0,"The watch face is kind of large, so it is a little bulky, but my daughter loves it. It works great."
4.0,Sadly this was too big .. I am 5'2  105 LB ordered S but I will have to return.
4.0,Very nice quality. Goes well with everything!
4.0,Not the best quality on the writing.. It's faded in some areas. The shirt itself is still good quality. Fits a little bigger than what I was hoping for.
4.0,It just fits. I was expecting to have a little room for growth. My 4 year old granddaughter loves it.
4.0,I love how soft these are.  It loses a star because I love the top and I love the shorts.  But not together Happy with the purchase.
4.0,"I was surprised. While the stripes do remind you of a scene from Beatlejuice, I wore this outfit to a club and received several compliments. I am a plus size women 5'10""  290 and shaped slightly different from the sexy model in the photo, however; it does give a sexy silhouette if you have the butt and boobs to carry off the style.  Another fact, this is a different head-turning outfit that will elicit comments from onlookers. I had to re-enforce the zipper in the back because it was not sworn very securely, but other than that and needing help to zip up the outfit, it looks great on and worth the price. Additionally, a pair of Spanks would not be lost underneath, but be careful, if the outfit fits your legs tightly and you put a hole in your pantyhose or Spanks you will be able to see the outline of the hole in the pantyhose/Spanks underneath (...lol)."
4.0,"I have not worn these boots yet--since it is cool out I may wear them this week.  The color does not look like the picture--it's a little darker, but they are still cute."
4.0,"Excellent quality, looks really good, but I have to give it 4 stars only because it is way, way too big for a normal face.<br /><br />I am not a skiny guy, but it looked too big, and had to return it.<br />But again, if you have a wide big jaw and face, this will work for you, otherwise the quality is great.<br /><br />Thank you!"
4.0,Looks fine. But it took me 30 minutes to screw one of them.
4.0,Runs small in shouldwrs
4.0,Super soft lightweight material
4.0,These are good really helpful for blood circulation.<br />But golden color turned out to be more of brown shade
4.0,"I love the sheer mesh design on these leggings and they fit perfectly. The only reason I took off a star was because only one of the pants has pockets, the rest don't ‚Äî which makes them a bit impractical when I'm at the gym."
4.0,I love the dress just wish it came in a bigger size
4.0,Love it. Would be a 5 but it was purchased for my son and it is to big for his face.
4.0,Metal pieces are cheapq
4.0,I feel the socks somewhat on the thin side and a little short. Nevertheless the quality of the fabric is fine.
4.0,Industrial strength key rings. I've never had flat key rings before. These are hard to open to start looping through the keys. They work fine.
4.0,That worked for me.
4.0,"I like this top, though I'm not 100% sure it will last through many washes. It looks like a body suit in the pictures, but it's just a regular tank top. I would probably buy again if it holds up in the wash."
4.0,Good quality‚Äã but this chest is just not wide enough from side to side...
4.0,This was the centerpiece for a &#34;good luck key chain&#34; for a friend. It certainly served it's stylish purpose and thankfully the horseshoe was facing the proper way!
4.0,"Cute dress, fits really well."
4.0,This looks like the picture. Good fit and quality.
4.0,This dress is beautiful! Perfect for a holiday party. I'm a 36C and I couldn't zip up the large. It has ZERO stretch.
4.0,"I wanted to love this purse, but I only like it. It's beautiful but I'm not a fan of the construction. The hand straps are made of this gorgeous metal and leather combo but they're connected to the shoulder straps, so the longer straps are always pulling the metal out. I've attached a picture since that probably sounds crazy. I only wore this purse for 2 days and it drove me nuts.<br /><br />Other than that it's really pretty. I would have returned it but I think the inside bag will be useful so I might keep it."
4.0,Suits the purpose it is intended. It has an animal print on it as well....pleasant surprise!!! :-)
4.0,"My daughter-in-law wears mostly blue clothing and she loves this bag I gave her for her birthday.  My sequin black is great, but she's not a bling kind of gal."
4.0,"Color is much lighter than what is shown in the image.  It's almost a fluorescent red, not a darker red as the image appears.  but still cute."
4.0,Fit almost perfect
4.0,"nice, light weight, fits well"
4.0,I really like it. Good quality.
4.0,It's okay..material could have been better.
4.0,"it's very cool, but they forgot to send the part that goes around your neck. All I got was the shiny part."
4.0,"I think because of the width of the jackets, they look better in the second hole of the ears...if you have a double piercing, like me."
4.0,"This dress is great, for the most part. The fabric is a butter leggings type fabric. That means it is super stretchy and soft, but also doesn't do the best job at hiding lumps and undergarments. The fit is great. It comes right to the knee. The neckline comes up nice and high. The pattern does look a little bit childish and cartoony in person. So, super soft. Fit is great. Fabric is okay."
4.0,The gray lens is too dark but fits very good
4.0,These run small I think
4.0,Cute dress for island nights ....
4.0,I have this in a few colors and love them. I‚Äôm giving 4 stars due to some weird sewing on the black one I received. It was sewn wrong and I returned it. Will probably buy another black one at some point.
4.0,This is a little shorter than I thought it was going to be but I love it. It fits great and the color is beautiful
4.0,It faded a little after the first wash.
4.0,The style of these glasses are quite large. I ended up giving them away because when I put them on I looked like a fly. The color was nice.
4.0,This shirt was a bit smaller than anticipated but I also have a large chest so that could just be me. It's a cute shirt that I've paired with both skirts and pants. I recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,"Love the shirt. Got a medium, but probably would have been better getting a Large"
4.0,"These are so cute but they run really small. Order a size or two up from what you usually would for a high waist, loose pant. I love the color and the cut and the fabric is great, too -- very breathable and comfortable. It has a nice, wide waistband and the pockets are cute. Again, order at least one size up!"
4.0,I like the price but the product is not as clear as it looks in picture. It was a good fit in pandora bracelet.
4.0,Adorable handbag! Got it with the matching print dress. Dress is just ok but the bag is great. I get compliments all the time. Great size and lots of storage. Order a spare for a friend or so you have another for the future.
4.0,Nice piece. My daughter enjoyed it.
4.0,Compress great for ftm just isn‚Äôt enough breathing room. Have to go up in size. Easy to get deodorant stains off
4.0,"So far, so good.  Fit is excellent.  After multiple washings, the fit is still ture.  Too bad they don't come with a choice of color."
4.0,Product seems okay.  Made from flexible rubberized plastic so hopefully it will withstand my 2 year old.  Only issue is I ordered the Lava Red and they look mostly yellow with a slight red tint.
4.0,Everything is as described.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because light only comes from one side.
4.0,They work good but scratch very easily. Make sure to use the case any time they're not being worn.
4.0,"Its very nice , soft and comfortable, i would have given it five stars if not for the problems that I recieved with the order and delivery, and the fabric on the sweater is irratable, like wool fibers or something , and it sheds ridiculously , gets on everything but other that I am happy with the product"
4.0,a bit itchy at times where its stitched together but super cute! you gotta wear a tank under it though because its a bit see through. I wear mine often!
4.0,The design is nice and clearly can see what it is suppose to be. But it looks a lot cheaper of quality in person. I expected the chain to be flimsy but I planned to swap it out anyways. The pendant was lightweight and looked more like a plastic token. It would be great for a costume though. I gave it an extra star that I thought it should be because the seller was great to work with. Very quick to respond and helpful.
4.0,I live in Maine and hike regularly. This hat works well. The only drawback is driving with it on; the puffball hits the back of my seat.
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear at my friend's 1950s themed wedding.  With a petticoat beneath, it looks great!"
4.0,"While the chain and beadwork is nice, the lobster claw you would use to hold a mask is very tiny and difficult to put around masks made with wider elastic or shoe string or thicker cording.  It would be fine for the smaller elastic typically used on disposable masks."
4.0,"I get so many comments about these glasses. They're super cute, but not the best glasses for actual protection. I find myself still squinting when it's bright outside. Still, I really like these and would buy them again."
4.0,I ordered this veil for my daughters upcoming wedding.  It was shipped fast and well packaged so there was no damage upon arrival.  The veil is held by a hair comb that is also used to attach it to the brides head.  There was a little bit of extra material that is bunched the edge of the comb that worries me for it staying attached to the comb itself with wear - should be easily fixed with some hot glue.  The flowing part of the veil is very soft and elegant and no noticeable defects to this area.  It is a dual layer and can be worn over the face if one chooses.  Overall it is a very simple for the most part well made veil for an amazing price.  Very happy with the swift delivery and the affordable cost.
4.0,"I want to give this dress 5 stars because I absolutely love it but I have to give it 4 because I need to exchange it. The dress I received is sewn a little crooked at the neck (one side curves outward) and there is a button spacing issue on one section that hits at my stomach, creating about an 1‚Äù slit that is rather noticeable and stands out from the rest of the spacing.<br />Flaws like this are not uncommon and typically it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal (especially if it wasn‚Äôt noticeable) but $45 is a little high for me to settle with noticeable flaws.<br /><br />Other than that, I love the dress. I bought the pink and lavender and I‚Äôm seriously considering purchasing the other color. I love it so much that the flaws on the dress I received aren‚Äôt going to deter me from repurchasing.<br /><br />It‚Äôs really gorgeous on and it‚Äôs so billowy and flowy. It hangs beautifully and the fabric is light, soft, and comfortable. It‚Äôs long enough that even with a heel it touches the floor, but it‚Äôs not so long that I feel like I‚Äôm tripping over it without or with a flat sandal or boot. I love the length and was pleased that it doesnt run short.<br /><br />I ordered a small and it fits pretty perfectly. It‚Äôs a little large under the armpits and at the bust though, but nothing I can‚Äôt manage. It‚Äôs very low cut so finding the right bra to wear with it is going to pose as a challenge. However, due to the flaw that curves outward at the seam of the neckline, I think it makes it fit looser and larger than the other side.<br /><br />For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 130 lbs, a 34B, and my measurements are 33 27 37 and I‚Äôm typically a size small/medium or 2-4 depending on brand and wear a size 26 or 27 in women‚Äôs jeans, if that helps.<br /><br />This dress is not see-through but it is on the sheer side, so nude undergarments work best with it. The color is a bit brighter in person and not AS pastel as its high end inspiration, so keep this in mind. The pink is much more of a bubblegum. It‚Äôs still very pretty though.<br /><br />I honestly love it so much that I‚Äôm bummed I have to wait to wear it until I receive the replacement. It‚Äôs going to be my go-to summer dress.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, despite the flaw on the dress I received, it‚Äôs a gorgeous dress.<br /><br />**Update 3/5/18**<br /><br />I ordered the black and rust colored dress and absolutely LOVE it! It‚Äôs one of my favorite dresses, hands down. Luckily, I didn‚Äôt have the same issue as the pink version I purchased with the awkward neckline. The dress I received had no flaws in the button spacing either.<br /><br />The black and rust version is so stunning and I‚Äôve worn it multiple times. Every time I wear it I get compliments and glances left and right.<br /><br />I have a rust colored bralette that I wear with it, so even though it is slightly visible it doesn‚Äôt look awkward or too revealing and it fits the style of the dress.<br /><br />The top button did pop off during my third time wearing it, luckily I was in my home when it happened and was able to find it. Note: this dress does not come with extra buttons.<br /><br />I sewed the button back on myself but I‚Äôm going to take it to the tailor to secure all the buttons to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again.<br /><br />I still have not been able to replace the pink dress, however I may not. The black and rust is a lot more wearable for me personally and though the pink is gorgeous, I am more comfortable in the black and rust dress as a whole and it just fits my style a lot more.<br /><br />I still completely recommend this dress and I‚Äôd buy it again in a heartbeat!"
4.0,Product looks good and for the price happy overall. However 1 earring set was missing a pair and there were 6 backings for all the earrings total. I don‚Äôt recall it mentioning only 3 sets of backings and not one for each.
4.0,"This jacket is really cute and looks exactly like the picture. This sweatshirt does run super small though. I usually wear a size small so I ordered a size 4 but it was way too tight. I sent it back and ordered a size 10 and it fits perfectly. It did however come with a large rip under the arm pit. Because I would have had to pay shipping to send it back, I just sewed it myself."
4.0,"The dress is exactly how it is pictured however it does run a little large so I would say either order your exact size or order down- it has plenty of stretch to it (think of a bodycon dress). If you are tall, it will be perfect for you well well. Purchased for someone that is 5‚Äô10 and she was able to wear heels!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, especially for the price. Runs a little small in my opinion - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 130 lbs and the 6 was a little snug. I made it work because I had a time crunch but I should have ordered a size up."
4.0,Percent for the one time use.
4.0,So pleased with this beautiful dress.
4.0,"Very pretty and delicate. I have small wrists, and it‚Äôs nice to be able to adjust to my size."
4.0,Nice jacket runs a size small
4.0,Love the size of all 3 sets. They were a little awkward putting in but could just be me. Currently wearing one of the largest & smallest & are super comfortable.
4.0,Nicely made...<br /> Bands fit a bit tight.
4.0,used to keep swelling down on legs
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4a40f32cf47ab10869a8eafbce2dd512]] Can‚Äôt wait to wear this set out! Fits perfect.
4.0,These are great leggings!  The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because the black is not as pictured it is actually solid black.  Which is not what I was expecting but I actually really like the black and even ordered a second pair!
4.0,"The bracelet was exactly as described. My husband likes the look of it. It's sexy and masculine but not overbearing. I gave it 4 stars becausel we both wish it was a little bigger. I bought the 8.1 inches and I wish I had bought the 9.1 inches , the run really small but overall is a really nice quality bracelet . I received this bracelet at a discount price in exchange for my honest review"
4.0,"My daughter bought this for her friend for her birthday, it's beautiful and she loved it."
4.0,"Super cute, but don't stay on well at all. Plus the lint collects like crazy on these things! I usually just trim them with scissors because they do keep my baby's feet warm"
4.0,"This shirt is different from every other shirt in my wardrobe, and in a very good way!  The very first time I wore it out, I received a number of ""nice shirt"" compliments thanks to the color fade and fit.  This is going to get worn a lot!<br /><br />Fit and comfort are just fine, the size was as expected."
4.0,Expensive for the material.
4.0,"Very pretty, but HUGE!"
4.0,A little snug on the wrist but the quality is top shelf.
4.0,"Cute, casual sundress with nice ruffle detail at the top.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and a small is a good length.  I didn‚Äôt give this item 5* because it is a little too full at the bottom and appears too baggy on me."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 116lb. I usually wear xs but I got size S and it was good.
4.0,"Loved it! Soft and comfy, just a bit on the small size."
4.0,Really good for price
4.0,They are heavy
4.0,"Beautiful, but..I didn't read. It is a SINGLE earring. Love the bracelet that was a gift. So, I got it in my shopping cart to buy another"
4.0,I wear this chain every day. I got the smaller length and don't have a charm or pendant. The rose tone matches my other jewelry beautifully!
4.0,Fine quality and print - fits VERY small for the supposed sizing. This is a large on my 8.5 year old.
4.0,"This was a gift for my grandson, thankfully he got them in time to wear them for the 12 days of Christmas."
4.0,"This dress is SO cute!  It's super soft and extremely comfortable.  I love it!<br />I'm 5'4&#34; and 113 lbs and I ordered a small in the black.  It fits me pretty well, maybe slightly longer on me than it looks on the model.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that it is a bit wide on me.  I wasn't expecting it to be quite so big around the middle.  I know it's sort of a shift dress, but I don't know.  I guess I just hoped for it to be slightly fitted, just so I didn't look like a box.  It's not advertised as being fitted though, so I suppose that's my own fault.  It's still very cute and I plan on wearing it to work with tights and a scarf or maybe a statement necklace.<br /><br />Note: I haven't owned it long enough to wash it yet, but I just really hope it doesn't shrink!  It's about the perfect length right now."
4.0,"Its OK, nice build but quite a bit wider than I expected.  Not sure if this is a great belt for business casual, but it's a good casual belt.  You do have to size it, and if you want to reverse it you have to remove the screw and flip the belt around on the housing.  Really its a belt you can buy, size to your needs, and then pick what color you want."
4.0,True to the picture but it did run a little big.  Its a nice skirt for a third of the price of any boutique store
4.0,The hat is amazingly comfortable and of upmost quality. A steal at 9 bucks and if you love days of thunder a great addition to your nascar collection. The only bad part was the close pin holding the coke advert got tangled so badly in the mesh I had to cut it out.
4.0,"It's good at first, but after a month or two of wearing them on the weekdays and washes, the rubber inner parts start to wear off, which lets the sock slip. It's a definite no-show sock though. Very thin and breathable as well."
4.0,Have not had a chance to use them yet..lots of rain..have tried on an they fit like I hoped they would .. Great
4.0,Really cute can wear with multiple bottoms. Making several outfits with 1 top
4.0,Attactive
4.0,"Not great quality, but didn't cost too much either... so probably worth every dime haha"
4.0,"I fell in love with the picture of it on Amazon. When it came, it didn't look exactly as expected. The stripes didn't stand out as much. But that's about it. I don't regret my purchase."
4.0,The dress came much earlier than I expected. The top was a little snug but I am able to fit it perfectly fine. The costume itself is gorgeous and a dream come true!
4.0,the crown itself is beautiful but it definitely runs small for an adult and is very heavy on the head
4.0,"Thank God my niece is slim because this was smaller than expected. Although small, it was beautiful"
4.0,im satisfied
4.0,It's cute how it does fit but the lace is stretched tight around my thighs.  Watch out if you've got gifted gams!
4.0,"It's a bit small for a dude like me but I like it overall. You get what you paid for. No doubt.Really liked the professionalism also.Got a nice company card,neat presentation, sweet...."
4.0,This was very comfortable and washed very nicely.  I am 5‚Äô4 181 lbs and ordered an XL.  Fit like a glove and was not too snug.  It is a thinner fabric than a tshirt so it good for the club if you get hot.
4.0,"Great alternative material, good feel. I've bought them before and been very happy with look and fit.<br />One confusing thing to look out for but probably due more my reading compensation.<br />The belt is sold by length and not waist size. So I ordered 'size' 34 but it was actually 34 inches long so therefore too short for my 34 in waist.<br />I just ordered another after figuring that out and gave the other to my kid."
4.0,Not as long as pictured in pictures
4.0,"I put this mesh bracelet on my Timex Weekender Fairfield (replacing the leather NATO that came with it) about 6 weeks ago and I'm VERY pleased.  It looks great.  I've gotten some nice compliments from coworkers and it has a nice shine.  If I could improve anything I'd say it can feel somewhat rough on the sides, but it really doesn't bother me, especially at this price (I got it for $10.99)!"
4.0,Bought this watch and love what I received was great a cool and timeless look
4.0,"the fit was a lil baggy and the pants are see through, it was still wearable though because the shirt was long enough to cover it"
4.0,Haven‚Äôt had to use them yet so cannot say how they will hold up.
4.0,My granddaughter and her friend (both 9 years old) loved the t-shirts. Wore them as cover ups and tied up the  bottom to wear with shorts.<br />My only issue was I did not realize there was a difference in size from child small and youth small. I will know next time but on the up side they will be able to wear them for a long time.
4.0,"Just detailed, wears well."
4.0,"The varnish already started peeling like a 3 weeks after I got them, but hey, they were cheap, and they look cute, AND they are polarized so I think they're a great deal!"
4.0,Overall cute dress. The material is slightly thin but good for the price!
4.0,"It's cute! I am 5'8, 145lbs, and I typically wear a small or medium in womens. I got a medium in this and its perfect. It's lightweight and thin, perfect for a cooler summer morning/night. The color I got is the coral one and its pretty bright. I wore it for family pics and I ended up de-saturating it in every photo because it was so bright. The sleeves also stretched out really easily, as it was 85 outside and i just slid them up to my elbows. I haven't tried washing it yet, but I will update once I have. It must be hand washed."
4.0,"I orderd a 1x since that is what I normally where. It fits perfect and is flattering. I'm 5 ft 3 and 195 lbs and it does not look like a  Moo moo and is fashionable. I ordered the blue and I love it! It's the perfect smokey blue color. This is a cute, comfy cotton, pretty and light weight dress. I wore a tank top under it or it would have been super boobalicous as it already shows off too much clevage for me."
4.0,Works great but I have to remove the gear fit to charge it.  the band is too thick and doesn't fit on the charger without being removed from the band.
4.0,Great buy for the money. I love the look of NATO style watch straps. Also the color of the strap look's great.<br />Do note: it is a NATO style strap. Not two separate pieces. Also the synthetic leather is typical synthetic leather and will turn a liter color when stretched.<br />You'll get:<br />1. synthetic leather strap<br />2. Strap tool for putting on the strap<br />3. 4 spring bars
4.0,Quality is ok not as good I want. But it fits good
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful piece we‚Äôre dainty and elegant wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for myself but it is a very nice piece.
4.0,They are very cute - and seem to be good quality.
4.0,It is so cute. A little bit uncomfortable at the beginning but you can fix it and you will love it.
4.0,"Kind of odd fit the way the ankle buttons are so tight but foot area plenty big‚Ä¶ not great for chubby babies, but we‚Äôll make them work. I‚Äôve only ever used the burts bees brand and loved them but gave this site a try just for the multiple color options. Will be sticking to the plain colors from burts bees from now on though."
4.0,This is super cute. It fits a little more snugly than items of the same size.
4.0,Heavy cute great for the money.
4.0,They are very comfortable but not as warm as I had hoped but for the price nice.
4.0,Beutifu
4.0,It fit mostly. The top portion was great because I have larger breasts. The bottom half was a little slender but I was still able to fit in. I bought a size large
4.0,"These earrings are so cute! Very light weight and love that they are double sided. The only downside is a pretty strong chemical smell, but it dissipates quickly and is gone after the first wearing."
4.0,Its more of a beach dress.
4.0,"I travel internationally for business and have been concerned about credit card electronic theft.  Hopefully this wall with prevent the theft.  Nice leather, very functional, not too thick."
4.0,I alternate between the 2 bands. The magnetic band is lighter but need to be careful not to snag on clothes.
4.0,"Great quality. It fits just fine but the XS is a little bit snugger than I was expecting. However, bathing suits do typically fit tight to the body."
4.0,Liked the quality but it‚Äôs too big for a hand bracelet
4.0,"Well made, just as good as similar shirts costing twice as much"
4.0,still love it
4.0,Looks good. A lil pricey though
4.0,Great jacket. Fits true to size.
4.0,"Very comfortable, great to relax around in or can add accessories, shrug, denim jacket etcetera to ready make pop out"
4.0,"Very light weight t-shirt material. Pattern is not as vibrant or 'real' as listing's photo indicates. Design is stamped on fabric (white inside as shown in review photo). Design isn't matched at seams (see photo attached to review). Sleeves a tad too long, but expected cuz I'm 5'2"". Length hits 2"" below knee."
4.0,It doesn't fit to size it's a little snug.
4.0,"Love my hats, they took a few weeks to get here but will worth it. I like that I can put them I my car or purse and they're ready to go"
4.0,"I read all of the reviews... Ummm people, it's obvious the flower is yellow, so why all the complaints??  This necklace is very cute, my daughter is very pleased."
4.0,I ordered the purple color and it is fabulous. The material feels nice and thick. Size small fits me well. Very happy with it.
4.0,Went up a size.  Very nice. The color are beautiful.  Hope the color hold up after many washings
4.0,The fit and the length also the he dress was light weight just what I needed for my vacation
4.0,"The earrings I got weren‚Äôt round, they were princess cut. (The smaller earring in the photo) That‚Äôs my only complaint. They are real solid white gold because I‚Äôm allergic to everything else, and I d had them in my ears since I got them with absolutely no issue. I love this kind of screw back because it covers the tip of the post so it doesn‚Äôt jab you behind the ear while you sleep or talk on the phone."
4.0,nice top for the price.
4.0,Only 4 stars because inside map pocket had broken female snap from when it was made apparently.<br />Not gonna return because it‚Äôs perfect in every other way. I wanted more of a slimmer fit so ordered the ‚Äúmedium tall‚Äù and received 190/75. Dated 2015. Love it
4.0,"good, although the material feels a bit rustic"
4.0,"This sweater fit as I was hoping it would--perfectly achieving the fashionable &#34;oversized&#34; aesthetic. It's made of thick material and it gets much softer once it's been washed. (I didn't put it through the dryer, preferring to air-dry cable knit sweaters, so I'm not sure how it would handle that.) The tag on the back was stitched to the outside of the sweater which was quite odd and the stitching is a little thick along the shoulders, but the sweater looks nice overall!"
4.0,"I started using these on my reader glasses. So far, they are working great and they are comfortable."
4.0,This is a fun tee with a lot of personality.  I love the print of the  Dia de los muertos or Day of the Dead on the black tee shirt.  My daughter may steal this one from me.  This shirt is extremely soft and has a nice loose fit with a wide shoulder line and neck line.  It has great workmanship with all hems and stitching straight and finished off professionally.  I am going to wash this inside out just in case but I think the embellishment on the front will be long lasting and durable.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"The dress is a perfect match for my 40‚Äôs era fashion. The material moves/flows nicely and is quite forgiving in terms of not being too clingy in all the wrong areas. I normally wear a 6/8 (athletic build) and I ordered a Large, just to be safe. I could have ordered a Medium and it would have been fine, since this dress is a little big on my waist. The color is a rich, deep red. The length of the garment is just below my knee, but I am not very tall either. I like the addition of the pockets. The tie accessory really sets the dress off for that 40‚Äôs flare and innocence. I also like the 3/4 sleeves. I will buy another design in this same dress!"
4.0,"Not quite as pictured. Thought it would be like a carved/moulded/cast coin kind of pendant, but it's an image under a  clear raised &#34;glass&#34; dome. Also its more of a oiled bronze color than gold,and the chain feels plastic and cheap. I swapped mine out with some dark brown leather cordage I had braided together. Looks much better now.but I do like the pendant."
4.0,"This pant looks well made and it is a good buy for the price.  The color, however, was not what was described or pictured.  I needed a true red pant, but these were burgundy, almost wine colored.  Service and return was fast, though, so I‚Äôd try another color if I need another pant."
4.0,"Very pretty, not especially heavy but looks great with jeans and a tshirt."
4.0,When I first saw this product on TV I came to Amazon right away to check it out.  I took some time to think it over and I liked the charity aspect behind it.<br /><br />I used a gift certificate from Christmas for Amazon so I thought of it as being two gifts in one.  The bag is sturdy and quite useful for a variety of things from a personal tote bag to groceries.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the burlap does leave particles.
4.0,it looks good. like it.
4.0,I send it back bc it was too big. I ordered by the measurements in the chart but they are not  accurate. The dress was nice and the fabric was good material. That's why I give 4 stars. I returned it. So sad.
4.0,The description should say long sleeve T shirt. It is very light.
4.0,It is a great sweatshirt it was just smaller than expected
4.0,This shoe is so comfortable and a great shoe for walking
4.0,These are pretty and look just like the picture.  I have brown/black hair so they show up especially went. However they were much bigger than I was expecting.
4.0,"Love the color. She‚Äôs able to wear the bloomers now, top falls off her shoulders and shows too much. So I just mix the bloomers with a different top. My daughter is 18 months."
4.0,Not easy to get on an off.
4.0,As I have found with all the footwear I have bought these ran small! I wear a 10 to 10 1/2 and I bought these as size 12 and they are still snug. I hope they stretch out a bit soon.
4.0,Good shoe. Fast delivery. True to size
4.0,Easy to insert and look very good!
4.0,Longer length is more comfortable.  Doesn't roll up.
4.0,This is a good product however if you are normal sized or bigger it will be tight or too small.
4.0,Baby is six months the sunglasses are to big the hats are touch big but usable
4.0,I am 5'8&#34; about 120lbs. The top fit flawlessly (I'm a 32 b) but the bottoms are a bit tight (I wear a size 2-4 jeans). Still adorable!
4.0,pretty good like the wait distribution and the strap is thick so it has a lot of support
4.0,"I measured my glasses because I wanted them to fit right, and they do. They are a little fiddly to put on and get adjusted, but once they are on they look pretty great."
4.0,"The instructions for assembly were a bit vague in places. Some grammatical errors as well. Took me about two hours to assemble.<br /><br /> The pictures show the fiberglass rods being slipped into the safety net loops first, side by side. The metal couplers will not stay on until about the fourth piece, when you have to start bending the rods to fit.<br /><br />I also had to rotate one of the leg assemblies when trying to snap to the circular rings.<br /><br />I lined up the zipper opening of the safety net as shown in picture in the instructions.  That puts it right next to the vertical support tubes. If you want the opening to be centered line the net up that way.<br /><br />Be sure to install the springs symmetrically, 180 degrees across from previous. Otherwise the tubes will not stay assembled."
4.0,They fell and look great!
4.0,Order a size up for cheat comfort . Great dress otherwise
4.0,This top fits really well and has a classy look. I'm a big proponent of pockets but I wish this top didn't have them. They take away from the classy feel of it. That's my reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5. I love the button accent and collar.
4.0,"Nice rugged cap, unique camp pattern.  My only problem with it is, it is not as comfortable as the Mfh brand patrol caps.  Or the Miltec brand patrol caps.  Its just not as comfortable."
4.0,This bra was a little tight but it is sooooooo soft
4.0,I'm digging the bracelet sop far. The ties on one side already came loose but an easy fix.
4.0,"Good quality sweatpants.  Thick material for warmth, good workmanship and a great fit.  A true value for the price."
4.0,"And even that this product is somewhat small, be careful with the size... Otherwise I love the desing and the product in general. The material and the desing its wonderful."
4.0,This chain is beautiful. Able to hold my new Majik Ninja Entertainment medallion.
4.0,The jackets seem nice for what you pay for them. But I received a grey and navy instead of 2 navy's and the package even says it's 2 navy's. My son's school only allows navy jackets so I would like this fixed then I might change the review. They had me ship it back and sent me the right one.
4.0,"As advertised, nice shirt."
4.0,Unsure of authenticity because I bought these as a replacement of the ones I had originally bought at an MK store then lost... glasses case was not like the original and seemed cheaper in quality. However glasses still look good
4.0,"I love the shirt. I usually purchase a medium or small shirt 6/8 size...so I order a XL based on measurement size on line. A little big, so I think that a L would have been perfect. Therefore, I reorder for a smaller size (L)."
4.0,"Very nice looking watch, looks more expensive than it is.<br />The only drawback was it is slightly thicker than I thought it would be however that is just a personal preference."
4.0,"Daughter wears size 9 and many reviews cited that size as needed and said they were perfect fit, I think they are a bit small"
4.0,"Dress is absolutely stunning. I'm 5'7 230 pounds. I ordered Large. I love the way it accentuates all my curves. I would definitely recommend this dress. I gave it 4 stars because I kept pulling up the top all night, the top is not very secured."
4.0,"heavy duty , well made ."
4.0,Fiord is one of the best quality producers of fine stockings. I would the come d their products.
4.0,"Perfect for the gym, could use a little more support in the toe area but very comfortable and light. Fit true to size."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:43031e9ee6187dd652a9744223e34de4]] Pattern, color and style are as expected perfect!!!  Size runs small and there isn't much stretch to the fabric, that was disappointing...I usually buy an XL in this brand so it's roomy and flowing but this one hugs my curves. So yes, it turns my hubby's head that good but it's not as comfortable for me to sleep in. The material is soft, the neck and arm openings are adequately sized with the length being about 2-3 inches above my knees (I am all legs, so the nightgown will be longer on most ladies but shouldn't be below the knee (I wouldn't think). Yes, I would buy it again but for this style I would got up another size. I already own 3 other styles of Ekouaer night gowns. Love this brand!!!"
4.0,"The masks were as advertised and arrived promptly. However, as is usual for this type of mask they were packed in a cardboard container, which was then placed into an ordinary mailer, so that the box containing the masks was smashed and unusable. Of course the masks were in a sealed plastic bag inside the cardboard box, so they were safe to use, but the box had to be discarded and the masks placed in a zipper-type plastic bag to keep them clean once the sealed plastic bag is opened."
4.0,"I really love the skirt for this item and was mainly the reason I bought it. It's beautiful and thick enough that you don't need to wear anything underneath it. The top, however, is a bit awkward. I'm a bit on the heavier side with slightly wider hips than a chest. I usually buy a large for items like this which allowed the skirt to fit perfectly but made me have to tweak the shirt which was just a tad too wide under the breasts and would expose my bra. Otherwise, the quality of the product is great and looks and feels comfortable. I absolutely loved this outfit after I got a couple of safety pins in the side of the shirt."
4.0,"I have a small head and this is still a bit tight.<br />Love the sparkles, though!"
4.0,I got this dress for my granddaughter. It served its purpose. However was ripped and a little cheaply made. It‚Äôs cute but not durable. Had to send to the cleaners to iron. Was very wrinkled when it arrived.
4.0,"Ordered a medium because several reviewers said they run small. I also checked the size chart, and thought medium would be the best choice. I'm about 5'8&#34; 145lbs, and the medium was too baggy. I felt like one of those cheesy nerds who listen to that hip hop garbage. It cost me almost half the price of the jacket to return it, so I got butt hurt and didn't order a replacement. It was a nice jacket though, so eventually I will probably order one in size small. Hopefully from a different vendor since the first one (Retro Star) didn't offer free return shipping, which should be considered mandatory for anyone selling clothing online."
4.0,"They are okay,  kind of cheap looking"
4.0,"Love these, they last a long time. Just wish they came in 2X"
4.0,"Nice quality, I unfortunately ordered 2.0 when I needed the 1.75"
4.0,The material is nice and the overlay doesn‚Äôt appear shoddy. I would buy again for $12!
4.0,These earrings are nice but very tiny.  They'd be perfect for a little girl.
4.0,"I bought this not sure if it would fit. I am a 40"" D bust but it just did. I did have to buy pasties because it caught my nipples in the chain. I do wish they had one with a few more rows of sequins for the larger girls."
4.0,Red and blue pair and very comfortable. Black pair feels like a different material. Not so stretchy.
4.0,"The top rides up a little at the waist, fits well in the arms and bust."
4.0,"The belt works well but is so thick and ""sticky"" on the back that it's hard to thread through the belt loops even on jeans with large loops"
4.0,No other jersey I have receives the comments like this one.  I purchased the XL and it fits appropriately for me ‚Äì 5‚Äô10‚Äù & 165 lbs.  Leave it in the closet on those ugly hot and humid sunny days when you reach for a headband to keep the sweat out of your eyes.  It doesn‚Äôt move the moisture as well as my Castelli jerseys but it doesn‚Äôt cost as much either.
4.0,These are nice but I have to rescrew one of the rubber nose pieces back on. They fit nicely and the lenses are pretty dark.
4.0,"Very soft, plush and comfortable. Might run a little long, but fit is pretty much as expected. Not like other thick robes that may get too hot. Stays warm, but breathable. The robe is cinched in the back which gives a nice design element. Pockets are a bit shallow though. My phone falls out sometimes when I'm sitting down. Overall a good purchase."
4.0,It‚Äôs a really nice polo but more of a slim type fit.  Make sure to order the next up.
4.0,I really like this shirt.  Great fabric.  Washes well.  Could be longer.  Do not put in the dryer.
4.0,"I purchased these sweatpants for my husband who has been asking me to buy him some of these type of pants that are skinny around the ankles.  These type of jogger pants are very popular right now.  They are supposed to be more fitted all around and have a band at the ankle.  If you are wanting loose sweatpants these are not for you.<br />I ordered XXL for my husband which is his normal size and they fit him great.  He is 5'7&#34; and 250 pounds for reference (I'm including a few pictures as well).  They are tight around his ankles like in the pictures but not too tight where they would be uncomfortable.<br />I washed these pants like normal and hung to dry because I was worried about shrinking.  So far they have held up great and have not shrunk at all.  The material is thicker and not thin and see through like a lot of Chinese made clothing.<br />Overall, I think these are a good pair of joggers.  They aren't the best quality you can buy but for the price I think the quality is just right.  I would definitely order more.  I purchased these jogger sweatpants at a discount in exchange for my review."
4.0,Perfect fir chilly fall days!
4.0,"It's such a beautiful bag the best one here on Amazon I've seen so far but I been contemplating for two months to get it cuz I don't want to waste all that money for just one purse when I'm not gonna use the other three. (Including the wallet which I have a Disney one already) so I finally did buy it. And the zipper doesn't work properly. The sellers are really good at contacting you to keep up which is nice but I told him about the zipper and he said does it work now and I went to reply again that no it doesnt close I have to re put the zipper back and try multiple times to get it to close. And it won't reply. It says error. I'm like odd did they block me so they don't deal with the issue or is it system error. But I tried for two days now to send a reply. So lol idk what that is all about. I can simply return it and get my money back instead of replying to the seller about the zipper issues what is he gonna do through messaging. But I really like it so I don't want to return. But if it's already Messing up now and I just got it I wonder how it'll be in the long run. Also my sister said the purse is flimsy. I thought by the photos it's thick and puffy. But I said well it's only $40 and she said my purse is $40 bucks lol and hers feels like thick leather and it's big. So idk . Again this purse is the best to me and very luxurious and beautiful colors gold and white but the issues of the zipper and it's thinner than expected. I'm in love with it so I'll keep it. Just dissapointed to spend that much money for the zipper to be messed up, for it to be very thin and for me only to use the main purse and not the other 3 which will just be donated or given to family or sit in my closest. So it's a Toss up you know."
4.0,Cute and adorable sweatshirt. The print on front is vibrant and well done. The fabric is soft and thick. It fits my 2 year old toddler great. This is a great layering piece for the cooler and colder months. Versatile to wear with any little outfit. I would definitely purchase again.
4.0,"Pretty colors that stand out,  but you really have to match them with the right colors and clothes. The insoles were cork based and did not feel as comfortable.  Otherwise the fit was good."
4.0,"Nice, comfortable fit for my 38DD's."
4.0,Like the dress! The bust is a little big but fixed it not to look as bulky with a wooden bead to offset both sides. The wooden bead needs to be bigger just didn't have them.
4.0,"This is a nicely made jacket. The zippers all function smoothly and the material feels nice. The stripes are a sporty accent. However it runs small. My XL fit more like a L,It ends at the high hip, not a super flattering look for me. That being said it is nicely constructed that should last. If you layer or are between sizes, go up."
4.0,Nice souvenir
4.0,"Love this swimsuit! It looks really cute! I only gave it 4 because the top part isn't very supportive for us big breasted ladies. It's not bad, I just prefer my tatas to sit a little higher. :)"
4.0,Overall ok gloves
4.0,"ALright Let me say first of all that i absolutely LOVE THESE chokers to death. I saw a spiked black one at hot topic that was very cute but the heart was very small and i decided to check online for something a bit better. I found these and saw that they had nice reviews so i decided i'd give these a shot.<br /><br />They arrived sooner than expected and unharmed. Pastel Pink and pastel purple and black, exactly as the picture shows. The leather feels pretty good nice and sturdy, not stiff or too wobbly. The heart is nice and big just how i liked it. However the purple one IS much thinner than the black and pink ones. so watch out there. Even though it's thin, it still feels good enough. like it wont crumble or anything like that. The snaps are secure and there doesnt seem to be any issues with snapping them on n off. Good quality overall, worth my money.<br /><br />MY ONLY problem was that they fit way too lose on my neck, even at the tightest snap. Im pretty thin, i weigh 105 pounds so i was hoping they would be tighter.  IF YOU DO NOT MIND THEM TO BE SO LOSE FITTING, or have a larger neck, then i recommend this product. I fortunately have a sewing machine and was able to alter these chockers to fit my neck more snug- the way i feel they should be in the first place.  However, if you do not own the means to make adjustments to these or have the patience to do so, then i dont recommend these chokers just because i feel they don not fit ad chokers should.<br /><br />But overall theyre very cute and i like them so just watch out when considering these for your fashion collection as they do seem to run large.<br /><br />Note: i added photos however the ones where i am wearing them are how they fit me AFTER I ALTERED THEIR SIZE,  REMEMBER THEY ARE LARGE AND I HAD TO ALTER THEM TO FIT ME BETTER SO THEY DID NOT LOOK THIS SNUG OUT OF THE BOX!!!!"
4.0,The bands are 2 pieces and often come apart...my husband Works with his hands and has already broken one
4.0,Had the goggles for about a week and am generally happy with them.  They fit nicely and the tinted lenses are nice when outside.  They do seem susceptible to scratching but even though they have a couple of scratched it doesn't diminish the view.  Tried them on my 2 year old daughter and they seemed to fit because of their curve.  Wouldn't recommend buying them for a young child but if you are buying them for yourself and have a young child it might be worth trying them.
4.0,"Nice thick design.  I am a Theatre Director, this is nice as it will hold up for the long term regardless of number of uses."
4.0,"The XL does not fit as an American XL which would have been too big for me.  It is a nice skirt well made from good quality fabric, but it just runs a bit small."
4.0,Held up to my abuse.
4.0,I bought a pair of these glasses before and I needed a spare. Love the glasses. The first pair I receieved a hard case but this time only a thin soft case which protect the glasses in your pocket. Would not purchase again without a hard case.
4.0,smaller than anticipated but overall a good product.
4.0,So at first I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to like this shirt but it‚Äôs really cute and comfortable and very stretchy. I wish it came one size up like a 12. I‚Äôm usually a size 10 but I would have preferred a size 10. The shorts were kinda tight but you can‚Äôt see. You need this as one of your staples. Get it.
4.0,Lenses are a bit too dark for my liking. Overall sturdy construction.
4.0,"Super cute for my school‚Äôs Holiday PJ theme, but not super comfortable to sleep in."
4.0,"Great classic Vans with gum-brown color is awesome. It feels the same as the regular classic slip ons, but I feel like the gum will help it from scratching off at the heel over time. Plus I get compliments. üëçüôÇ"
4.0,"Comfortable and great value. Wash before wearing, they do leave a mess on the floor!"
4.0,"I liked the color of this, but wish I had remembered to order at least one size down."
4.0,"Nice T-Shirt, pleasant to wear."
4.0,Wish the adjustable straps had a little more stretch to them. Barrel squeegee pockey is a little farther back that I prefer.
4.0,I like this product and it fit in perfect to my square toe boots.  I like the fact the bottom heel and front both had a sticky pad that keeps this in place.  I anticipate many years of use with this product.
4.0,Waist was large. But good
4.0,received on time and works fine
4.0,Loved the earings but the thickness of actual piece that goes through the ear was too thick. The actual crystal part I loved.
4.0,"You won't find better shorts for the price. If you do, let me know because I want to get them. They're really good shorts, perhaps a tad shy of great. As some reviewers have pointed out, the pockets are freakishly small, but still big enough to function as needed. I have a pretty large phone (LG Stylo 2) and it sticks out a little, but not enough to be a problem. I have a pair in green and a pair in blue and the pockets are a little bigger than these Light Coffee (khaki) ones, which is really strange, because they seem to be identical otherwise. Overall, at least 4 stars. For the price, no complaints here."
4.0,Love the designs! Colors have not faded in the wash like other baby clothes and the shoulder has two snap buttons for extra next room when dressing. FYI- the care tags are large and on the outside. I had to cut them off so there is some fraying but for the most part the waistband of any pants cover this.
4.0,Beautiful but stinky. The plastic it comes in stinks and leaves a stench on the scarf. I just sprayed some perfume on it and let it air out!
4.0,"These aren't for fancy evening wear, but if you're looking for gloves for costume purposes these work really well. I used the Amazon glove fitting guide and that worked really well (I've really broad hands, so it can be an issue). These are good, dark, comfortable cotton gloves. The only flaws I found were (a) the fingertips were a bit chunky and (b) long threads were hanging from the ends of the decorative stitching -- basically they knotted it but didn't bother to trim the threads. Not exactly a difficult thing to fix! That's why I give them a 4 instead of 5. Thankfully I'm turning these into fingerless gloves anyway, so the chunky fingertips didn't matter."
4.0,I ordered a size up and it fits perfect. Very cute!
4.0,This dress fit perfectly. My only issue is the back is pretty see through. The front is not because it‚Äôs two layers of material but the back is just one layer.
4.0,"I'm 6'2, 180 lbs, and this fitted awesome!! Only down side is make sure you get your fittings right, I ordered the 40&#34;R&#34; and I felt like I was floating in the blazer, but that's it! Overall blazer was amazing, and I used it for 2 proms and got away with it :D If you're slim get a Slim, If you're on the big side get Regular fit."
4.0,Very pretty. Wish I the Tory Burch ensignia could should more prnounced.
4.0,Just the coverage I was looking for. I gave this hat a four star because it does not feel like cotton and there is nothing on the hat that states what the material is.
4.0,"Overall, they're OK. Stitching could use a little quality control, but you still can't beat the price."
4.0,"Anyone looking at this hat should know right away that it is both very large and also stretchy.  For what Turtle Fur is charging, it should be available in multiple sizes.  I purchased the black with silver reflective stripe version and was very pleased with its look and knit.  I really wanted to keep it, but the hat was so large and stretchy, I could easily pull the whole thing down below my chin.  It went back the same day I got it."
4.0,So light and comfy for summer! 4 stars only because it is a little sheer. Really love it though!
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good length, a little above my knee. The neckline was way too big. If it was a rounded neck it would have been ok."
4.0,"Very pretty colors and floral print. Comfortable and lightweight for packing. Great over a bathing suit, little black dress, or tank and shorts. Wore this in Puerto Vallarta and will definitely travel with it again and again."
4.0,The pattern of the My Little Pony's is a bit faded on the bathrobe but my daughter didn't seem to mind.  It fits as expected but I don't think it would hurt to order the next size up.
4.0,"Personally, I love this dress! It is very lightweight, so it is perfect for summer! That being said, I was not expecting it to be as thin as it is, but it's not see through or anything so that's alright! It is adjustable so can move loosen or tighten it to fit your body!"
4.0,Ordered XL ...Regular dress size 12/14.  Good fit ...  machine wash/hang to dry.  Beautiful emerald green color.  Material is heavier than expected.  Well worth the cost.
4.0,It's a really cute dress but it's too long for me. I'm short so it's just a little longer than the picture. Also you have to iron out the skirt if you want it to look nice.
4.0,I got these for dying my hair and my daughter's hair. They were cheap and they work.
4.0,"I loved the hearts so much and it was such a good price, but a bit small for my face. I gave them to my friend and she loved them even more! =)"
4.0,Bought it for my daughter thought it would fit her she is 8yrs old slim figure. It is a beautiful bracelet just as in the picture. Recommend for a adult..
4.0,Loved it! Great for my sister in law wedding and any occasion!
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and good quality.  However, this is the 3rd dress that I purchased and returned.  Not because it wasn't a beautiful dress but because the dress did not zip or fit past my waist.  I am 5&#34; 6&#34;, 146 lbs, 38B and I got a LARGE and it still did not fit.  Getting frustrated!!  How someone that is 6' and 170 lbs says that the LARGE was a tad small is unbelievable!!"
4.0,"Cute, a little lumpy."
4.0,I like the earrings and would have given them a 5 if it hadn‚Äôt been for the cheap post backs. I am using a set from another pair of earrings.
4.0,"Adorable. The shirt seemed a little small around the next and arms, but my daughter is petite so it worked out fine. For those whose kiddo is a little stockier might want to go up a size. Altogether a well made product!"
4.0,"I used to have a 1"" blue tie clip but lost it. So I replaced it with this one. It's a very nice tie clip and fits pretty well albeit not as tightly as my original 1"" clip, hence the 1 start deduction. But otherwise a great tie clip."
4.0,"A bit on the big side so if you have a small face I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Also if you are looking for a thick mask this is not for you. It is rather thin but does have a pocket for a filter which is nice. Aside from the large size, I enjoy it because I don‚Äôt like heavy masks."
4.0,Light and great for traveling!
4.0,Bought this for my husband who had been wanting a wooden watch. Overall it is a very nice watch. Looks very sleek and nice on him. The only con is the band is slightly tight on him. He is 6‚Äô3 with a big stature. It bothers him if he wears it for too long. It would have been nice if the band was a bit longer.
4.0,I love how this set is stretchy.  I don't like that it is not as slippery as I like when tossing and turning in bed.
4.0,"Very comfortable tshirt dress.  Loved the color, fit, quality and price.  It was a bit long, but I am short, 5ft.  It would be great for a casual gathering.  I returned it because I wanted something for a dressy event and it was a little too long for me."
4.0,"Very soft, fit great & keeps me in place.<br />I did get 1 of the bras in the wrong size."
4.0,"4 stars because it had stains on it, So I returned it."
4.0,Nice size for intended purpose. Quality ok.
4.0,"My 90's husband loved his hoodie, but it runs really small.  I went two sizes larger after reading the reviews and wish I had gone even larger, zero stretch.  Still great hoodie, really traps in the heat so good for colder areas and my husband enjoys it a lot."
4.0,"The biggest thing I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about was how expensive this was.<br />But I had a hard time finding something.<br />It worked very well , and we just layered a tutu on top of the exsisting tutu and it worked so wellüòç"
4.0,present
4.0,Watch is great for daily use. Just wished it was slightly larger as it is slightly awkward on a bigger wrist.
4.0,"Nice color, and good quality, the size is a little big for a pendant, fast shopping."
4.0,"Love the watch. Clean dress watch looks, will be looking to get another BENYAR for sure. Good Quailty And Value,"
4.0,"I like it. So far so good, i haven't had one of them slip off my feet while I was wearing it. This could change after several washes, but we will see."
4.0,Nice shoes comfortable
4.0,"Love this!!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and ordered an XL. The bust area is a little small. I‚Äôm a 40C, but it‚Äôs does not look bad. Romper has get stretch. Good for curvy figure and not to short. Sheer over lay will hit right at the floor with heels."
4.0,"Surprisingly flattering. The material isn't very thick, but it doesn't cling poorly like other cheap dresses."
4.0,"Whilst I am displeased that there are a few minor &#34;synthetic&#34; elements to it, I like that mostly it is natural/genuine. Stones are in good condition bracelet still feels fairly lightweight. I love that it has all nine and sun! It's super cute. Glad I got this."
4.0,Good price came super fast. Not quite what I was thinking on material and a lot thicker than expected but not a bad mask.
4.0,Solid pair of slippers. Actually fit !
4.0,They were super cute the metal irritated my ear
4.0,"I purchased these under the assumption that they were more white in color, from what it appears online. They're actually a blue tone. Also, the tiny ""cloud"" designs are more obvious throughout, where I thought it was more of a subtle look that faded away at the knees. Not what I expected, but they fit great and are super comfy."
4.0,"I like the headband and pattern and the fact it can be used 12 ways.  Unfortunately for me, I find it a bit snug on my head.  Others may not have the same problem.  I have not used the 12 ways yet, but it should serve its purpose. Cannot yet attest to the cool-tech claim yet."
4.0,Sole could be thicker as it wears out easily which affects grip
4.0,fits fine over eyeglass stems. keeps glasses from sliding down your nose.
4.0,I like that it's lightweight and it fits in the side of my golf bag easily.
4.0,"The product was as described...including being very tight like some of the reviews said. I thought that since my son is only 9 month and still has a pretty small head circumference that it would be a little looser, but the headphones squeezed quite a bit and left red marks around his ears after about 5 minutes of use. However, I'll say at the same time that you need to get a good seal to keep the sound out, so I have a hard time giving this product less than four stars. Just bear in mind that a very little head probably won't be comfortable for more than 5 or 10 minutes wearing these. In our case, that's all it took for the 4th of July pre-parade (sirens, horns) to go by and we were good."
4.0,"This is a nice soft scarf. However, it's not a warm scarf, it's more for decoration. I've never had a scarf that's only printed on one side, so that's kind of odd. The ends are cut in points to give a cascading look. The uneven edges feel unfinished if that makes sense. The scarf is made in Germany. I'll wear it under a coat to keep the wind off my neck, but I'll have to be mindful of the blank side showing."
4.0,Nice item arrived quickly
4.0,"I'm in love with this dress.  Fits nicely.  May have to have the bottom cut, as it is a little long on me, I'm 5'5&#34;."
4.0,It was unexpectedly nice. However there was a small problem with one of the bracelets.  It was knitted way too tight and it wouldn‚Äôt lay flat against my wrist.  Wasn‚Äôt the case with the other two bracelets.
4.0,Kids grow so it‚Äôs fine but this size 12 is very large. I have a giant 3 year old whose feet I measured. These sandals are way larger than a 12
4.0,Onyx shines as dies the gold
4.0,Well made; cute design
4.0,"The material is a nice quality and hangs as the picture shows.  I didn't find the slit to be too high.  This can still be worn alone as a dress, no need for leggings. I'm 5'2&#34; and 138lbs and I purchased a small.  Also, the package showed up 1.5 weeks early which is a plus!"
4.0,Liked this a lot. Not see through and good for layering.
4.0,"Great belt, ""Graphite"" does not come as shown, though. It's definitely blue!"
4.0,"First thoughts after opening: The case might be small for some people's glasses, but I'm fairly small (and so my glasses are too) so it works for me. I do wish the case opened up a hit more than it does (doesn't even open to 90¬∞). I thought the color wpuld be more of a vibrant purple based on the product images (and like the jacket sleeve on one of my pictures), but it is a bit more maroon. Does it really matter that much to me about the color? No, but I was drawn to this one because of the (supposed) bright color. Overall, it seems like it will get the job done well enough. 4/5 stars"
4.0,Didn‚Äôt meet expectations
4.0,I got this as an addition to my baselayer for biking. Works great on cool mornings that are not so cool that they need somehting a bit more. The fit is good but real snug.
4.0,"Cute, cheap, fun top to go over a camisole or tank top. Great to pack, it folds up to hanky size. Empashis on cheap :)"
4.0,Great ski socks.  Like the compression.
4.0,Needed for a western themed party. Haven't worn it yet but for $12 it seemed reasonable. I washed before wearing. I usually buy a medium but this was only available in a large. It appears to run a little small so I am happy with the large.
4.0,"Color is beautiful. Thin material but not see through perfect for summertime in Northern Michigan, which should be on a Wednesday this year ...."
4.0,Muy bonito y su calidad buena
4.0,Thery are nice
4.0,"Purchased these pajamas for my 9 year old godson. He's usually a size 10 or 12 in clothing.<br />These pajamas run extremely small.<br />I'm so glad I went up a few sizes. I ordered a size 16, it fit him perfectly. I know they wont last too long, and he'll probably only get to use them for a good 3 months. If I would have known, I would have gone up two more sizes.<br />It looks great though, and he loved it."
4.0,Like the pieces but some are pretty big which will make them hard to work with in my jewelry pieces.
4.0,I bought this coverup in black size M. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 132lbs and it fits perfect. It was a little long for my liking so I made it shorter and added the Pom poms back on Friday the bottom it is so cute.
4.0,Acorde a lo esperado
4.0,I should have ordered a medium instead of the large but I wanted it for casual wear.  So I just cut off the extra length and hemmed it.  It's really comfortable.  I would order it again.  Just order the normal size that fits you.
4.0,"Wife loves it! Good for, breathable!"
4.0,For price it‚Äôs a great product
4.0,"Smaller than expected but the band stretches easily, almost like a hair band in feel."
4.0,"I'm pleasantly surprised with this product! I'm an XL and bought the XXL because I read reviews saying how small it fits. It's a little snug, but it falls nicely. There's no way it'd close (if I put a button or zipper), but I don't think that's how it's supposed to look. It falls very nicely! It's also a lighter jacket. It would be perfect for a wedding or summer event."
4.0,Like the dress. I have a lot of these type dresses and this is the first one I bought that ran small! I'm a small person but it was snug through chest and arms. Good material though and not see through at all!
4.0,It's super cute but my I ordered my daughter and extra large (she wears 14-16) and it's tight on the armpits and waist and also the skirt is very short.
4.0,Bought it for my mom and it looked great on her.
4.0,Works great on my neuropathy alleviates the pain
4.0,Pretty color...pleased with the fit and style
4.0,"Not a ""scullcap""; i guess it would be great if you have a LOT of hair. Well made."
4.0,These are really good looking boots. They‚Äôre tight across the top but should loosen with wear.
4.0,Stylish and comfortable.  Satisfied with the purchase.
4.0,"One star because it was cute but docked stars because one leg is bigger for some reason??? I bought it and it said sold by Line Friends so I don‚Äôt know if it was a dud or what. So disappointed :/<br /><br />Update: I was sent a replacement that arrived quickly and does not appear to be a dud. Much happier now, I recommend buying, however if you get a dud like I did don‚Äôt hesitate to get a replacement :) I changed the one gold star to one star docked for the purpose of the first Koya I received."
4.0,I like this shirt. Material a little rough but I have not washed yet. Would buy again.
4.0,"These were thin, and felt disposable. They fit fine."
4.0,"The masks are fine, so I did not post any pics.  The filters that came with the masks however are definitely not 2.5 PM.  They are tissue thin  and not the required 2.5 PM as stated.  I have ordered other replacment filters and I definitely can feel the difference.  In the pictures the filter with the bent corner is the one sent (the other is previously ordered filters)  and when I turn them both over you can see the difference.  There is definitely a layer missing."
4.0,Es m√°s peque√±a de lo esperado
4.0,Very nice comfy shirt. Only problem is it wrinkles fast. Don‚Äôt even think about putting it in the dryer.  Even on wrinkle release setting it was absolutely horrible.  I had to rewet it lay it flat for a while. I then hung it up to dry the rest of the way.
4.0,"I really like the look of this cardigan the stripes really flatter my shape and it fits ,flows and drops the way i wanted it to. You can do alot of things with this cardigan if you are a fashionista lol. You will love it"
4.0,"I received this shirt in an XL, I should have ordered a smaller size, but that it my own fault. I believe this runs pretty true to size. I love the wine color and softness of the fabric. The button details around the neckline give it a nice touch. I do feel the fabric around the neck feels a little heavy and I don't prefer that. Since I did get it too large, there is a lot of fabric around the waist. It cleans up nicely with a small waist belt though. Love the pockets!"
4.0,"They came as shown on the picture, feel great (though i probably should have gotten a medium, these seem too big for my hands.) I use these for pictures and parkour sometimes and they haven't broken on me so they are good! Very reliable!"
4.0,Perfect for the peplum look!
4.0,It looks nice. It is a little sharp to the finger. The price is fabulous. Once the sharp issue is fixed; it will be a five stars review!
4.0,"These are super cute! But, Tom's website says for adults to order 2 sizes smaller than what you normally wear, but these were still way too big for me, so I had to return them. I would probably need to go down 3 sizes."
4.0,This is cool to wear and looks good too but the chain is cheap and breaks easily. Worth the money and speedy delivery.
4.0,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the Zipper was unsewn in two spots..Not a major thing to fix and easier than the hassle of sending it back. Amazon did credit me half my money back for the inconvenience. 5 stars to Amazon
4.0,"Really nice, but the 2-3 X size certainly did not fit, they are more like a large to 1x"
4.0,A very good hat high quiality product.
4.0,"Very classy look, not hard to put together"
4.0,"Given as a gift to my niece, an avid Harry Potter fan. She loved it!"
4.0,I love them and great quality
4.0,The shirt is made from comfortable material and is more stylish than many other military style shirts.  It is a tapered at the waist which is not a problem for although someone with a beer belly may find it a bit snug.
4.0,"I'm 5'1, 130 lbs and pretty busty. I ordered a medium and it fits great. The top is a little lower cut than I would have preferred, but it's comfortable and looks great!"
4.0,Nice light sweater.
4.0,NIce shirt.
4.0,Nice child's earring
4.0,"Quite big but will be nice when they actually fir my son, high quality and well made."
4.0,My dad likes them
4.0,"Love the hat, it's just that the snaps on the chin strap don't hold the earflaps tight against my head. When walking into the wind the ear flaps flare out and channel the wind in. With a little work on the that issue this would have received 5 stars."
4.0,The price of these are great but they were just a little too big for my taste. I ended up keeping them but only wear them if I‚Äôm going out on the town due to the size.
4.0,Nice fabric. Great color. Definitely exactly as described. Will order more in different colors
4.0,This is a sweet little piece to express ones love. Well made but not heavy or ‚Äú in your face. I bought 2 and happy I did.
4.0,"I'm getting older, and even though I wear these, I keep wishing they were a couple inches longer."
4.0,"I specifically got this for comfort so that I could sleep with my Samsung Active Watch on and track sleep activity.<br /><br />One issue I have is that the springs are not secured to the band. When you take it off the watch, they can fall out freely.<br /><br />I expect it to loosen over time and accept that for the price."
4.0,This hat is well made but I find it to be bulkier and a bit larger than anticipated. I use it but wouldn't buy it again.
4.0,"I bought the sweater for my husband. He really likes it.  His office is very cold.  He needed a light jacket/sweater, something that looked professional. It fits the bill perfectly."
4.0,"Was a little tight, but ok"
4.0,NOSE PIECE HAS METAL THAT IS BARE :/
4.0,I know the main question that lady's may have is do these shoes sweat and the answer is yes! They aren't as bad as some other plastic shoes but they do sweat. However these pumps are very comfortable and you can wear them with jeans or a dress you can dress them up or down they are the perfect all purpose pump. I would recommend getting a size up because they do cut in the front. They arrived on time and they were packaged very well. For more pictures follow me on IG at Sadia _ Clark
4.0,The hat was very pretty and perfect for the event.  Too bad on my part that it was to small for my head and there is no &#34;give&#34; to pull it on.  I didn't measure my head to make sure that it would fit.  I would recommend measuring your head before ordering.  If you have a small head and it fits...you will love it.
4.0,"These fit best when worn without any socks/stockings because my foot was sliding around when I wore them (I think the size may be a bit big for me). They breathe really well, and are pretty comfortable. I will probably be adding an insert for arch support. I will probably purchase one size down next time (I usually wear size 6 US, ordered a 36)."
4.0,"Considering I only paid a few bucks for this wallet, I figured I'd check it out to see if I actually liked a minimalist wallet in my front pocket.  I've had it for less than a week and yes...I am hooked.<br /><br />It's not much smaller than my regular bi-fold wallet though.  It is THINNER, but that's all, but that is a good thing.<br /><br />I've realized that after decades of having a wallet in my back right pocket, now that it's no longer there, I feel liberated in a way.  It's so nice to not have that bulging wallet in my back pocket.<br /><br />I hate to say that I used this wallet as a stepping stone, but that is what I've done.  I've now found another high quality wallet that's even smaller that I'm now carrying in my front pocket."
4.0,Its comfortable for basic daily work out  and underwear use.
4.0,Really great accessory that i dont go anywhere without. Never have to worry where my bag is going because it hangs securely by me
4.0,I bought these for my husband to wear to work due to COVID 19 precautions..They are light weight. And makes wearing a face cover all day possible. Would recommend
4.0,The Magatama is nice and looks great but it is smaller than expected. Was expexting it to be about the size if a quarter but it is slightly bigger than a dime
4.0,Sent back items
4.0,"These really don't look like the same sized earrings, but they measure the same at the largest point.  I feel like I got 4s on the white ones and 2s on the black, I ordered 2s.  The white ones are definitely more delicate, the ends are very pointy and feel like they will break easily, so I won't be sleeping in these.  They are very pretty though.  The black ones feel more solid.<br />It seems like ordering from this company is a bit of a crap shoot.  But these would cost me $40 a pair at my local shop, so I guess you get what you pay for, probably worth the gamble."
4.0,Warm & light. Love it.  Not as thick as the one advertised but kept me warm on a spring night in Michigan. Ordered apricot color.
4.0,Could have been a little bit bigger. Maybe being tight I won‚Äôt gain weight
4.0,Returned it as it was large for my face. But it's gorgeous. I specifically loved the box!
4.0,Not quite what I wanted.  Pendant is larger than I had hoped.  I like it well enough to keep it.
4.0,Just too cute.  My gr grand daughter is darling wearing it.
4.0,"They are soft and cute and they‚Äôll be perfect for work. However, they are actually pretty thick with the cotton liner and should not be described as ‚Äòbreathable‚Äô. I actually cut the cotton liner out of half of them for hot days."
4.0,"I love the colors and the flexibility of the barbell. A few of the barbells were difficult to tighten the ball, but eventually the threading smoothed out and now they work without a hitch!"
4.0,"It was a beautiful dress. I bought it for a wedding. It was kind of tight in the armpit and breast areas so I tried going up a size, but somehow the smaller one fit looser than the bigger one. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a problem with consistency, but I ended up just keeping the smaller one."
4.0,Love the fit. Thick and flexible
4.0,"Beautiful earrings... but they have no post! You have to run the entire earring through your ear until you get to the chain! I mean, it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs pretty... but my earring holes are barely big enough to force them through... so guess I‚Äôll have to get used to them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Other then that I love them!"
4.0,"Used on a recent trip for both rain and sun. Worked well, but did not use is on a windy day."
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but can be loud when playing games.
4.0,"they look a little cheap in the photo, they are very nice quality and i am very happy with my new sunglasses! THANK YOU!"
4.0,"true to size, shipped on time. I don't think the sodalite colored ones look as good in real life as they do in the product picture but overall I think all three of them are worth the price."
4.0,I got it for a photo shoot and it was good for the price. It was a little more thin and flimsy than I thought it‚Äôd be but it still showed up nice on camera. I liked the length but wished the colors were a little more vibrant. All in all great investment to commemorate Class of quarantine !
4.0,"Incredibly true to color! It looks like it's grey with purple/blue highlights, I love this wig! I also like how I can cosplay either Ciel or Fem! Ciel with this wig, I definitely think it was worth the price. My only problem is that the ponytails are a bit frizzy, they shed a bit, and tangle easily. But that's to be expected. Also, the shipping was super fast, it came so much earlier than expected! Overall, I'm really happy with this wig, but need to do something about the ponytails even though I only wore them once. But, it's the best I've found and I would definitely buy again! üíï I added a few photos of my cosplay, I know I filtered them a lot, sorry! But at least you can kind of see how long it is and how it's not crappy? Again, sorry! üòÇ"
4.0,"Super cute to create a look you don‚Äôt want to be married to. BUT, it will create a scab...it pushes into your skin to create an authentic look and that can break the skin. I‚Äôm still giving it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Because I feel like all of that is common sense.<br />Oh, and don‚Äôt fall into the trap; my daughters wanted these because I won‚Äôt let them get face piercing lol, so.....they used these to show how cute it would be if they had their nose and lip pierced haha. Super cute but I‚Äôm not an idiot üòÇ"
4.0,"This is a great dress, but the fabric is thin, needing to wear a slip."
4.0,It was a gag gift for.my girl but she really likes it. This is NOT high quality but it has lasted for a few months being worn periodically.
4.0,Look beautiful on my little one.. with a little adjustment to the ribbon belt.
4.0,A bit difficult to put on but overall very comfortable I use it all the time now!
4.0,A pair of good quality and pretty glasses. Unfortunately they are too big for me. I returned them.
4.0,Very small print but super cute
4.0,Smaller than expected. But I am used to feed bag sized bags.
4.0,I like the product but there was no paperwork with the bracelet & another person told me they had information included with theirs.  I just wondered if there is any information that should have been in with this bracelet.
4.0,great fit  loving it
4.0,A couple I got them for love them
4.0,"Some are really quite nice, and others have a really cheap texture.  Great feature is they also come with silicone ends that fit well."
4.0,I bought these bags for a quick weelend trip on a Spirit flight. It has done well. No problems. It is thin and paper like but it works well.
4.0,This is a very nice bag if you are looking for a large tote.  It is made well and looks very nice.  One thing I did not like were the shorter handles.  I felt they would be in the way if I wanted to use the shoulder strap.  I wanted something smaller and that's why I returned it.
4.0,I bought these solely for that safety green/yellow color socks. I didn't pay attention to the how much polyester goes into these socks. Polyester doesn't breathe or absorb as much as cotton does. Too much for me to buy again.  Update: I washed them in cold water and dried on low. The gray does not come up as high as the others and the yellow/green pair are a tad shorter than the blue pair.(The ones I received anyways)  They are soft and cushy but I also need a little more height on the calf and more cotton in its manufacturing.
4.0,"Very fitted. Kind of hot, more of a spring/autumn dress."
4.0,"I‚Äôm gonna have one for every day of the week... soft, comfortable, keeping me warm and wash up nice and wrinkle-free! Perfect fit and makes me feel sporty!"
4.0,I like the hat... just what I was looking for.  The thing I don't like is the satin sticks out from under the hat
4.0,The quality is great. They are comfortable and roomy enough to accommodate rings. I wish they were a little longer. The lower portion under the wrist is bunching and has lost shape. I would have preferred the black bow but these are great
4.0,"This is not flimsy as other suggested, it‚Äôs light & very bright. Semi sheer. Great for summer hikes and walks. Runs a bit small but love it!"
4.0,Very satisfied with my purchase. Much sturdier than a previous purchase.
4.0,I ordered this bracelet to gift to my mother in law from the kiddos and I think she‚Äôll like it. I tried it on and it was a little difficult to tighten by myself. I like the bead colors and the little Grandma card which makes it very gift-able. I think that the strings that hang from the bracelet are a little too long and may get annoying but besides that it‚Äôs a well made bracelet.
4.0,"Only buy if you want costume cocktail jewelry. It is VERY FREAKING HUGE. About an inch maybe a little over. Not everyday type of wear. It also runs a bit big in the size. I got a 7 and it is probably about 7.5 really, not exactly 8 though."
4.0,a little baggy but I like this shirt
4.0,"My ankle bracelet is beautiful. I bought it with the intention of changing the ""S"" clasp. Upon receipt I found it had already been replaced with a regular clasp."
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars for fit but took off one for the fabric. I'm a 12/14 and this large fit me snug but not too tight to need the next size. The print is nicr but a little fuzzy, like a digital. And the fabric is kind of a stiff scratchy cotton? Either way it doesnt feel very nice on the skin. And has NO STRETCH. So if youre in between sizes, size up. I preferred the smoother, more stretchy and less itchy fabric of Grace Karin, so I returned this item."
4.0,Used it as a costume base for my twins devil angel costumes. They thought they were a little long (I like the length as their mom). Soft cotton material- can wear again. For reference the girls are 5‚Äô10‚Äù and this is the large.
4.0,"I like it because I've bought it only for the robe. Everything else is pretty much not usable. Besides the fact the bra and panties and absolutely transparent and cheap made,  it also doesn't provide any support and it's not adjustable in the back. So I would assume it's 36a"
4.0,Its a little short for bigger posterior
4.0,"Decent 'shaper'.  Definitely warmer than expected, but it does the job!~"
4.0,"It looked softer than what it is , I like it though"
4.0,Shorter than I normally like but otherwise great fit
4.0,After two washing it looks pretty done
4.0,Loved them on me but was a little disappointed on how snug they were they do fit but don't have much room
4.0,"It seems like an excellent solution to buckle belts for me,, as I have a problem with tearing up the old style belts! I find them somewat hard to slide the ratchet tight enough to be completely comfortable!  am waiting to see how them hold up over the long term, which is why I bought them in the first place! Only had them a week.<br />I they hold up for 6 months. I will give them 5 stars."
4.0,"The ankle elastic was pretty tight on my toddler. He doesn't have overly chunky ankles either, it was just super snug. The foot length was good, the material and quality were good as well. Overall good sock, I think that while The ankylos snug he will still be able to wear them."
4.0,They were bigger than expected.  Which I liked.  Rich color which shows up well against my brunette hair.  Lightweight.
4.0,Made very well one size fits all way to big I weigh 127 LB
4.0,This dress is the perfect length! I am able to wear 3.5in heels no problem. It‚Äôs incredibly comfortable and WARM. It has a fleece lining so it‚Äôs definitely warm. The plan is to wear this to our engagement shoot. The only flaw is that it‚Äôs not very forgiving in the front & I‚Äôm really sucking it in which is why it‚Äôs 4 stars. Overall it‚Äôs so flattering and I‚Äôve received many compliments from friends when I sent them pics for feedback.
4.0,I love hanky-panky but these colors weren‚Äôt for me
4.0,Can't find a better set if glasses; especially at this price. Only downfall is carrying multiple pairs of glasses for day/evening trips. 80% wind reduction for me and lenses are not distorted. Good viewing and look good as well.
4.0,"I like these sandals, the in between toe section is too long for my expectations but maybe that is to keep the top foot straps from rubbing/getting too clingy like happens with some sandals. They‚Äôre nice and light. So light I have trouble kicking them off. ALSO, NO LOUD HEEL SLAP, nice and quiet around the house."
4.0,"I only liked the Jade, its very well designed however not the necklace. Seriously my shoe laces looked better then this necklace. It looked cheap and tacky. I had to throw it way and replace it with a better version that matches the quality and beauty of this stone piece."
4.0,It's small and holds just enough of what I need.
4.0,Pretty cool but it did come late
4.0,"My daughter loved it, and that it has pockets."
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered one size larger and it fits beautifully."
4.0,Great product!! Fit perfect
4.0,"Dress was perfect except the length! I‚Äôm pretty short. 5‚Äô2 and 103lbs. With 4in heels on, I still have to hike the dress up a bit. It‚Äôs because I have narrow hips.  If I had average size hips or bigger, it would be perfect! I‚Äôll have it altered. Otherwise it‚Äôs amazing, very flattering around the butt. :)<br /><br />Buy a sticky bra! You‚Äôll need one."
4.0,"I really love the product itself, its super cute and great quality! but its way too small for me to wear because of my size. I'm a C cup and it doesn't provide enough coverage. Wish I could fit this!!"
4.0,I like the style and the color.
4.0,"it's a good looking shirt, but black is not a good color - would have preferred navy blue"
4.0,"Bought it for the blue, black, and silver earrings for an outfit. Packaging is nice and it arrived the next day so shipping is awesome. I tried on all colors because I know what it's like wishing you could see how the different colors look on someone before purchasing. The pink and champagne colors are duller on me than I thought they'd be while the light blue really stands out in my ear which surprised me. I sort of wish I'd ordered the bigger size but overall I'm happy.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend wearing these everyday or even all day. The post feels a little raw in my ear. Good for a night out then taking them out before bed.<br /><br />All the earring backs came in a small plastic bag inside of the case"
4.0,"Very good fit, looks nice, only thing is how does one define what a boxer brief is, as this is nothing more to me than a regular mesh lining. But still, for the price, they work for me."
4.0,Quality is as expected.
4.0,Product is great even though I only got 16 pairs not complaining.
4.0,"It is a good tank top! I expected it to be an awkward fit based on reviews and I was scared that around the tummy it would be to tight... Yes, ever so SLIGHTLY, it's smaller but not enough to go up a size. I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,It was built perfect. But sizing is on the smaller size.
4.0,I love these leggings but i feel as if they r definitely not worth the price. Maybr lower it by 5 or 10 bucks.
4.0,"I really like the dress although it was sooooo wrinkled,being shipped üò• it's chifon and lace don't know how to get the wrinkles out it's so delicate I can't iron it,need this for my special baptism, but can't wear it like that!!! Help!!!!!!"
4.0,it is a nice watch for the price
4.0,Arrived in good time. Like the bekt overall but was expecting it to be a little wider.
4.0,"The fit and sizing were as expected. The material was lightweight. Unfortunately, when washed in cold water on delicate/ hand wash cycle and hung up to dry, it faded horribly. I purchased the red with white circles. The ‚Äúwhite‚Äù circles are no longer white, and most have an irregular pink color originating from the red around them. If all had turned pink evenly, it might be somewhat ok, but since it is inconsistently faded, it‚Äôs obviously faded which looks cheap and of poor quality. I‚Äôm debating returning it as I can no longer wear to a dressy function.<br />Update: the seller contacted me about my dissatisfaction. Sounds good, BUT then they offered to resend me the item or refund half the cost of it. I responded requesting another color OR a full refund as I planned to contact Amazon Returns to return the defective item. They refunded me half the cost without further discussion. Now I have to figure out how to get the rest of my money back from Amazon. I am fine with the seller trying to make it right, but half my money back for an item that obviously is defective is NOT okay. So, now, instead of giving the company a good review for helping me, I‚Äôll have to give them a poor review as well. I love the style of dress and thought the price of $30-35 for the style was good; however, a red dress with faded pinkish dots isn‚Äôt worth much at all.<br />Second update: I responded to the seller that I was not happy with a partial refund as I could not ‚Äúfix‚Äù the dress and it was therefore unusable. They did refund the remainder of my expense on the item. I updated my stars to reflect this. I think the lighter pigmented prints would be ok, just avoid red."
4.0,They where the right size but the back there not tight enough to hold tight
4.0,"love the bag, however every time it falls over everything falls out.<br />not happy with that.  love the red handles."
4.0,"I liked it, as the quality was pretty good and looks great."
4.0,This dress is bassically spandex. It's not float like in the picture unless your super small. For someone bigger prepair to really show your curves.
4.0,"Great belt. Genuine leather. I get the feeling it will never peel. It seems like the same piece all the way through. It keeps my pants from falling off. This has lead to greater self esteem. My wife even finds me sexy now.<br /><br />It's a very soft leather, and not very firm. The back is fairly &#34;grippy&#34; from the softness, so it doesn't slide through the belt loops at easy as a more shiny belt does."
4.0,I am usually a large and I got a medium. It‚Äôs cute and I will keep it but I think I could have gotten away with a small. If you are a little smaller up top I Would definitely size down twice.
4.0,"Great colors! feels like it's built well, BUT, it ripped fairly easily. I was slightly careless, yes, but it should be a little more durable than it is. For the price though, it's to be expected! I'd buy it again!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, but didn‚Äôt fit üòû"
4.0,It was a bit too big in the waist but overall a good buy. It was mostly flattering.
4.0,These skirts move very well. A tad see-through.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was and very good quality
4.0,Liked sweater. Very nice. Ran really really small. Price ok.
4.0,The Item has good quality
4.0,Love it! I have multiple colors. But I‚Äôm missing a strap to my blue one. :(
4.0,"I like this brand for everyday affordable watches, but the band always starts to get worn out after 4 months."
4.0,Great 4 the price. Edges come up and can scrap u. Catches hair. Leaves green marks. But hey.... I love it. Wear it and would but again.
4.0,Muy bien üòä
4.0,"The dress fabric was nice, just as expected. The challenge I had was that I have a short torso and the waistband fit in a awkward spot. It would have required a seamstress to adjust. I ended up having to return it."
4.0,Great skirt but too small
4.0,Like the soft fabric
4.0,Bought these for work.  Light weight for summer.  Can dress up or down.  I get compliments on the colors.
4.0,"Shoes fit good but she didn't like the buckle, wanted velcro"
4.0,The heel protectors are a bit large for my shoes but I found if I wrap the heel in some paper the heel fits more snugly
4.0,love them got a lot of compliments about them i like the looks sharp looking
4.0,"Fits great, not too short. Sleeves are short though. I though this was long sleeve but it's more like 3/4 sleeve, my arms are short so Idk."
4.0,These are quite impressive.  Thicker than other types of gloves
4.0,"Pretty dress, good quality. Certainly is not as sexy on me as in the picture, it‚Äôs actually a bit matronly."
4.0,Very pretty‚Ä¶metal scratches easy but for the money it‚Äôs perfect
4.0,The colors are nice but some of them are a little snug.
4.0,Love this jumper. However it sticks out quite a bit on this sides. Would be cuter if there were pockets
4.0,Look pretty I were it for my birthday
4.0,very cute. little tight in the arms
4.0,Very pretty she's satisfied so we happy with them thanks
4.0,"I thought I'd give this costume a try since I had seen from positive reviews about it on several sites. The dress is very cute. The actual apron looks &#34;cheaper&#34; than I thought and I agree with another reviewer who said it could also pass as a maid's costume.<br /><br />The apparently does run big. After seeing reviews similar to that I got a medium instead of a large and it fits really well. I have to give extra points because this dress has a zipper. I think that helps with the overall fit and you don't feel like you're strangling yourself to get out of it.<br /><br />Definitely a good, cute costume for the price! I've seen much worse for much more money."
4.0,The fit feels good and lightweight! I have a wide head and these are comfy. Very good frame for the price! The plastic lenses are clear. No color tint at all.<br />They need more color options.
4.0,"Stones are very nice and come in random sizes.  My biggest gripe is that the bracelets are too small.  They fit my 7 year old daughter just fine, but it's kinda tight for an adult.  Fortunately my wife has experience making beaded jewelry, so she just combined a few bracelets to make a larger size."
4.0,"I don‚Äôt care about brand names or fashion I much prefer utilitarian,<br />having just undergone cataract surgery I need a good pair of sunglasses.<br />I particularly like that the wraparound and protect from glare from<br />the sides unlike my former aviation sunglasses.<br />I have not had them long but so far so good I would recommend them."
4.0,"It's hard to find cute summer sweaters, but I'm very pleased with this one.  I'm 5'9"" 125 pounds and this top fit perfectly in a size Small.  The material is a good quality.  The cuffs on the sleeves are a little chunky for my tastes, but look very stylish, so I didn't let that bother me.  Would be nice if a better variety of colors was offered, but I'm pleased with the Ivory."
4.0,"Good quality, bright colors and very warm. But it snags very easily. Besides that, I love this scarf!! I‚Äôve been wanting it forever and finally decided ‚ÄúYes. I do need yet another scarf.‚Äù üß£üß£üß£üß£üß£üß£"
4.0,Love the concept and the colors are pretty BUT the quality needs to be improved. After 4 uses the brackets didn‚Äôt hold. Under closer review the closing mechanism is strong and sturdy but the grommets/brackets on the individual arms didn‚Äôt hold up to close the umbrella. FYI:  the Green Is Not a 4 leaf clover it‚Äôs a Hibiscus flower with grass & the Blue is Rain Drops.
4.0,"It‚Äôs velvet. It‚Äôs got a heavy inner liner so it‚Äôs defi not a summer shirt. Buttons  are cheaply sewed on. But damn it looks good.<br /><br />Be honest. You won‚Äôt wear this often unless you‚Äôre a rock star. If you‚Äôre a rock star, you‚Äôd probably be buying more expensive shirts. I‚Äôm a big guy. Broad shoulders big chest I expected a 2x to run tight but this was a great cut for me.<br /><br />This is an EPIC concert shirt though."
4.0,I ordered the shoes for my daughter's gym class. They came a day early and they fit just as I expected them to. My daughter loves them and her class mates are jealous! I own a pair of Under Armour shoes myself and I love them. I'll be buying Under Armour shoes again.
4.0,I loved them but they broke. Definitely not an everyday thing.
4.0,Nice bag for a good cause!
4.0,I sent back to seller and will order the bigger size.
4.0,Ordered these for my daughters....they love them!! Rose was larger than expected!!
4.0,I really like the watch.  The only problem is that it is way too big.  I will have to get a few links removed before I am able to wear it.
4.0,"It ran a little small so I will have to wear something under it and leave some buttons undone.  Cute, though."
4.0,"Love it! Great quality, my phone fits nicely."
4.0,I recently purchased these sunglasses in black and the silver and light blue colors. They are holding up really well so far. They‚Äôre fun and super cute! I get compliments on them every time I have them on!
4.0,"The ad is a little misleading. I thought I was ordering white gloves but these are beige/natural latex color. Otherwise, they appear to be durable."
4.0,Nice vest! Not too bulky so can wear it all day at work.
4.0,"If you need anything larger than an XL, this will not work for you. Otherwise, it's soft warm and comfy."
4.0,Fits the Huawei Watch perfectly. Doesn't cost near as much as buying the same band directly from Huawei. The included tools make it easy to size the band easily.
4.0,This is just as the description and pictures. Its a beautiful red tulle with elastic waist. It comes with red sash and can be worn in many different ways. A great buy
4.0,I'm not an online shopper but figured I would give this a try. I normally wear a medium or large if I want it loose. I ordered a large and it was plenty loose enough and the length was perfect for when I want to wear leggings with it. Material is very soft. I was very impressed. I want one in every color now.
4.0,Very cute dress. The hem had some pulls that I needed to sort out. It also came with a very bright pink half slip that was completely unnecessary and which I removed since it was jarring when the split in the dress opened as it is supposed to do.Those are the only reason for not awarding 5 stars and it is now 5 stars with my corrections. The dress was fully opaque without the slip but would allow panties to show if were blown or swung until almost horizontal. Very pretty and flattering.
4.0,Slim elegant products
4.0,A little on the heavy side
4.0,I love attack on Titan and have a sweater. When I saw this I had to have it. It is thin which is fine because it is normally warm where I am. It is long on me about to my mid thigh. I am fairly short. I like that it is a button clasp and not a tie. It makes it look much nicer. The design on the back is nicely detailed. However I would stick to hand washing this so the design doesn't get ruined. My husband also likes wearing it too. He wants me to buy another one for him. I hope this is a product I can use again and again for a long time. If you are an attack on Titan fan you need one of these! I did receive this product for free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion.
4.0,Thought it was great perfect gift
4.0,These Belts Work Great On My 6yr Old Twins! Great Price Too!!
4.0,"The dress is not terrible but the fabric is very clingy, pills terribly and it a bit small. Easy to nurse in though."
4.0,"The top is not supportive, but easily removed... skirt fits perfect and love the mermaid shape and length of it..."
4.0,"Fits much smaller than expected. Bought an XL for a guy, and it fit more like a medium. Very thin as well, so not good to wear in colder temps.<br /><br />Material did feel amazing (outside of being on the thinner side) and design was awesome. If you buy, make sure to buy a few sizes larger than you normally would."
4.0,"It would have been nice to have a strap or something to keep this wound up when it's closed. However, a matching fabric bag came with it so I cut off the carrying strap and use that!"
4.0,Very pretty well made only thing is where the top of stone prongs are very sharp and snag on everything
4.0,This suit is so cute but very cheeky. Might wear around my fianc√© but would definitely not wear around family!
4.0,"My daughter loves these pajamas because of Minnie Mouse. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard getting her hands and feet through the wrist and ankle holes because this is a very snug fit...I know I would find it uncomfortable but she doesn‚Äôt seem to mind. I wish they were made of cotton, but good luck finding 100% cotton anymore"
4.0,"I read many many many of the reviews on here about this dress as I know you get what you pay for. I ordered down a size from my usual medium because I read the dress runs large. I‚Äôm glad I did for all but the length. Unfortunately, the dress was too short and stopped at my ankles making it awkward to wear any kind of heel. The chest did flap out and so I sewed in the sides a bit. The extra back strap was also a bit loose. Otherwise it served my purpose how I needed it for the price I was looking for and it was a really quality feeling velvet."
4.0,"I thought this was going to be more of a tshirt material, but I like it all the same."
4.0,"Cheap looking fabric, but super cute and what I expected."
4.0,"Pretty dress nice material, a little looser than expected but it served the purpose well for me. Great price for a dress like this."
4.0,Esta perfecto... solo que quedo un poco peque√±o
4.0,"Comfortable, hides a multitude of sins. I ordered both a 12 and 14 and they each fit. I didn't give five stars because the material isn't the toughest that  is used for suit construction---but for the price? Can't beat it."
4.0,For what I paid this is a pretty good band
4.0,Lens is good. Light weight. I use mine primarily for bike riding. Keeps the wind out and doesn‚Äôt fog easily. Comfortable and secure fit.
4.0,"This pair of women's ski gloves were sold to me by N'Ice Caps Accessories (nicecapsaccessories dot com) and fulfilled by Amazon.  They were shipped from Amazon in a USPS mailing bag as part of a multi-item shipment.  The gloves themselves were packed in a clear plastic bag within the mailer.  The advertising copy indicates that they are imported but there were no tags saying exactly where they were made so &#34;buyer beware&#34;.  The gloves have a 3M Thinsulate thermal barrier layer.  Thinsulate is a lightweight synthetic microfiber which is a very efficient insulator.  The material has a high &#34;warmth to thickness&#34; ratio so the thermal layer can be very thin.  These are very comfortable, soft, lightweight gloves with integrated knit wrist cuffs and adjustable Velcro wrist straps to keep the snow out.  Even though the gloves are advertised as %100 polyester, the cuffs feel like they may be made of knitted cotton.  Overall, they are advertised as being waterproof but I am somewhat skeptical.  The Thinsulate does tend to block some water absorption and the palm is made out of a &#34;rubbery/plastic&#34; PVC material which appears to be water repellent.  I figure they will stay dry for a limited time under normal snow conditions which is all I really need.  The gloves I bought have a somewhat randomly striped yellow/black/purple color pattern on the back with pink palms and wrist cuffs...a very pretty feminine design.  In my opinion, the small/medium size ran just a bit large for women.  I really like these gloves but I haven't really put them to the test in an extended use very wet environment.  For short periods in &#34;dry&#34; snow conditions they have done very well, keeping my hands warm and dry.  I would normally have given five stars but they did have a minor manufacturing flaw.  One of the seams was slightly open, allowing some of the white insulating material to be exposed...so four stars."
4.0,"I loved the slippers, order them for the delivery of my son. Still using them now after 4 months, I‚Äôve had to wash them aboIt 3 Times now. They cushions barely starting to hit the bottom."
4.0,like it a very nice ring..
4.0,Love the material. Runs small. Flows well over curves just a little too tight for my liking.
4.0,"I needed a bag to match some shoes and it was a perfect match. The bag is not sturdy enough for everyday wear, but great for occasional use."
4.0,This jumpsuiy fit perfectly! True to color.
4.0,This is such a simple but classic dress.  It's very comfortable and perfect for a brunch or even a more formal event.  I was complimented on it at a wedding brunch and I felt pleasantly 'fashionable' in it with a wide white bow belt that I bought through Amazon.  The elastic waist was a little higher than I wanted but the belt hid that.  Added a pair of deep navy sandals and I was ready to go.
4.0,"Arrived in timely manner, fits as I expected and we'll made.  Now for a 5 let's see how they hold up"
4.0,"I was surprised to find out how thin the material is.  It looked thicker in the pictures.  So it will not be an everyday item, but something for a bit dressier. It does not look cheap, and would be great with a dress or black pants"
4.0,These are decent bike shorts for the occasional commuter/cyclist. They layered nicely under jeans or other heavy pants when I rode in the late fall/early winter. The sizing is generous.
4.0,I like the brooch but after the SECOND wear the pin was separated. The picture speaks for itself.<br /><br />Needs to be replaced.
4.0,Nice material and soft feel.  I like how vivid the colors are on the fabric.
4.0,The sizes are too different in between. 7/8 is on the really small size and 9/10 extremely big. Other than that the quality is great and kids love it
4.0,At first I ordered a medium but had to return it bc it was too big so I got a small and it fit pretty good. Take advantage of the returns if it doesn't fit you simply return it and get a different size.
4.0,These are sooooo comfortable and fit so well. Washes in any kind of water with no shrinking.
4.0,Perfect gift for a teenager!
4.0,Very comfortable and they fit well.
4.0,"the design of this necklace is cute, my only problem is the string, loose up after few days so i decided to return the necklace."
4.0,Helped me make the decision to actually get my medusa pierced! Very cute! Though the magnet does have a bit of trouble sticking it tends to flip on the wrong side.
4.0,Great price for a great product.  If you have short or no hair they are noticeable from the back.  Tried the clear ones but they weren't as comfortable as these.
4.0,"Nice fabric, well made and comfortable. Great for casual daytime or even an evening out."
4.0,Strap is a touch shorter then I expected. Overall a good on the go bag
4.0,A pretty good watch for the price.  I've had it for several months and it functions well and look like a reasonably high end item.
4.0,"Nice collapsible umbrella for emergency use in the car. Small size allows it to be tucked in a side storage spot. Easy to pop out and use. Seems fairly durable, but not highly rec or ended under strong windy conditions."
4.0,"I absolutely love this swimsuit. I am 5'2 with 38DD boobs so I was a little worried that the top was not going to fit. I just got it in the mail today and it is a little tiny for my boobs but not tiny enough to have my nipples slip out. It was enough coverage but just be cautious when wearing. I got it in XL in the wine color and the bottoms fit perfectly. None of my fat was sticking out of the sides, it actually made me look slimmer."
4.0,Very nice. Unique. A little big but I have very small wrists so it usually turns over.
4.0,Will do the job
4.0,"Really cute necklace. The girl that received it really liked it. Nice length, long but nice. Came right on time. Item is as described and the rose inside the good is really nice along with the other two charms. Has potential to fade if worn on a daily basis and worn in water. Be careful with that. Overall, nice product."
4.0,"I love how this chain looks, very sexy! I plan to wear it this summer with my bathing suit. It has a nice weight, and doesn't look cheap at all."
4.0,"The cover up was as expected. It runs a little large so I suggest ordering one size down. I'm 5'5, 180lbs and ordered XL, would have been fine with a L."
4.0,Shirt.
4.0,"This romper is really cute but fits a bit big in the bottoms. I ordered a size small which is 0-2 but I am rather small at only 95 pounds and 4' 10&#34; so someone who is maybe closer to a size 2 would probably fit this size well since the crotch area hangs at least 3 inches below where it should on me. I generally have trouble finding clothes I like in my size so I will certainly keep this and alter it myself. The top is really cute and fits very well. It is see through so you must wear a tube top or etc under it. My husband loves how the top sits off my shoulders and; of course, that it is see-through. Note: although it may seem like the zipper cannot pass past the waist area, it does. The zipper area in the bottoms is hidden and thus can be a bit tricky to get all the way down."
4.0,Really quite intricate and lovely.  Much heavier than I expected.  Will really add to the outfit.
4.0,A little cheap but overall a good deal for occasional wear.
4.0,"Bought many pairs. They seems to break easily but my daughter has had multiple brain surgeries and these fit as to not hurt the sides of her head where her skull was removed. So we buy them due to comfort for her. If they lasted longer I would of given 5 stars,"
4.0,"Fits well, soft material. Great casual dress....unless you are busty, then you'll want a cami unless you want to be constantly checking to see if everything is in place."
4.0,"nice colors, sturdy construction"
4.0,"Fit perfect just a lot shorter than expected tbh. I still love it tho, i got a medium."
4.0,Its a great workout legging but I should have gotten L instead of M
4.0,The pin is cute but the part in the back to hold it together kept falling off. Not really worth the $$ I almost lost it a few times. I had to look for another piece to keep it together. Hopefully that‚Äôll do.
4.0,these seem to run a bit loose but there great after eating<br />they don't get tight and cut your breath off. lol.
4.0,I would have liked instructions on how to change the battery and take out links. But it was a good price and the watch works.
4.0,So delicate !  I can forget I have them in my ears.  I really enjoy wearing all three ! And I do...for hours ! (My earrings appear to look rounder than those in the photo).
4.0,I really like the way cuff earrings look but sometimes there is just too much going on. I like this piece because it's simple. You don't look like you're trying too hard when you wear it which is what fashion and accessories should look like.
4.0,"I love these. They are such a fun accent for your basic black outfit. They were a bit higher than I expected but they are not uncomfortable. These aren't going to be your walking all day shoe though. I think they would be fine for mild activity, which is how I've worn them."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised how well made they are and sturdy, but quite large.<br />Personally owing a moonlight blue Cayenne ,I felt that the Premier de Cartier üêà eye sunglasses may not be a good match since the lenses are not mirrored. üëèüëåAnd the Porsche is and until I try them on I can purchase the real deal.<br />I recommend trying these. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4.0,Love the way this sweater is made.  Fabric is lightweight.  I am however 5'8 1/2 and the sweater is shorter than I like.  Sits just below the natural waist.  If you don't mind just below the natural waist the sweater is a 5 star!
4.0,"I ordered a 2XL but I feel like the next will be smaller it fits pretty good. It does slim the waist, but for the cincher training I will go smaller. I enjoy the product it helps with posture and surprisingly my slight back pain. I will order another in a different size but over all good product in my opinion üòä"
4.0,These are super cute but a lot cheaper in quality than I was expecting. They feel very lightweight and bend easily.
4.0,I get a lot of complements on this dress! Really love the fit and it is very flattering for all body types.
4.0,"I was expecting it to be slightly bigger but it is small. Havent worn it yet, but it looks very prettyüòä"
4.0,I love this dress. The material is soft and it's not clingy. Fits just right. The only thing is it didn't come with the belt some persons said they received.
4.0,"Sizing is perfect.  Material is thin but super soft, easy to wrinkle.  Color is as described.  Perfect over leggings, very comfortable."
4.0,"I would have purchased a larger size.  It seems to run small.  However, I love the sweater and the quality is very good.  I would definitely purchase again."
4.0,I got a size up and it is long but oh so cute and comfy like a light weight stretchy tee
4.0,"Good bag. The hooks for the straps broke quickly and will no longer stay closed. So, the straps come unhooked every time it comes off my shoulder."
4.0,I'm a veteran and the hat fits as it suggests. It really stands out and I've received many complaints.
4.0,"Low-to-medium quality hat appropriate for its low $13.00 price.  The hat works for indoor use but its plastic mesh panels won't t provide significant solar protection.  The hat arrived in perfect condition because of the seller's innovative, clever shipping method.  The hat was enclosed in a sealed, air-pressurized plastic bag inside in an exterior shipping bag.  Amazon should adopt this inexpensive methodology for other small products potentially damaged by folding."
4.0,"Good quality,  small."
4.0,"love love love this style. I pair it with a belt and a scarf and I am ready to hit the town. The material is not my fav (80% polyester 20% spandex), but lays nicely on my figure and is light.  I am normally a size 16 ..5'2 ...hourglass shape I ordered the 14-16 since and while it is more form fitting than it is on the model I actually prefer it how it fits me. For the price paid I am happy. This has convinced me to spend the extra buck on a really nice jumper in the future.<br />My only wish is that it had pockets"
4.0,It is a very nice top. It‚Äôs comfortable and fits to size.
4.0,Great belt especially if your into the boho style.
4.0,"The dress is really nice! Delivery faster than expected. I bought the dress to wear to an evening wedding and it was definitely a hit. I received many compliments. The only negative thing I have to say is the color I ordered was supposed to be purple and the picture showed it as a true grape color. When it arrived however, it was fuchsia.  All in all, it was still a great dress I just had to pair it with different jewelry and shoes.  I would definitely recommend it! Just remember that if you are ordering purple, understand that it is not a grape purple. I am 5'3, about 118 lbs. The dress was above the knee but not too short. I would definitely buy again in a different color!"
4.0,"Looks great! Got the wrong size on the first order, still awaiting refund after sending it back, but I love the quality on the second one."
4.0,Super cute sandals however it was smaller than I expected but I think that might be because my daughter has grown.  I'm very happy with the quality of this Sandal and love the flower. It's the perfect Sandal for the spring.
4.0,"This jumpsuit is cute, the fit is perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 120lbs. I ordered a small and the length was perfect, I‚Äôd say this jumpsuit works perfect for shorter people."
4.0,"I ordered this Guluman wrist watch for our son and he says that he likes it a lot. Our son says that he likes the white color of the dial and the black color of the band and he says that he likes the design and the styling of the adjustable mesh belt, the detachable straps, and the mineral glass mirror.<br />He says he does like the ultra - thin case, the blue face and the quartz movement. Our son says that he likes that the watch fits his wrist perfectly well, and he says that it is comfortable to wear, and easy to put on and take off as needed. He says he does like that the watch seems to be made with quality stainless steel materials and it appears to be durable, stylish, lightweight and helps him keep accurate time so far.<br />Our son says he likes that this watch matches most of his outfit and fashion accessories. Considering the quality and the price point, it seems to be good value for bucks. I would recommend it."
4.0,"I love these belly rings, only problem I had was the devil heart not being made properly & wouldn‚Äôt screw in or hold."
4.0,Perfect fit but I would like to know some tips and tricks for taking care of my bracelet and charms! Maybe how to go about contacting the manufacturer/maker of the bracelets and charms (ninaqueen).
4.0,A little sparklier than expected but nice
4.0,"Looked so cute on my 11 year old daughter, also very comfortable"
4.0,"Good leather watch band.  I think they neglected to account for the watch itself, when figuring the band length.  I wear the band in the smallest hole.  I have never worn and watch band on anything except the 3rd, 4th, or 5th hole. The band is a bit long, but it should work."
4.0,"Comfortable, BREATHABLE for casual wear"
4.0,"I got exactly what was ordered, and it works just fine. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that one side doesn't have any teeth or extra slot to slide the strap through. That means that the strap won't stay tightened. I tried the pack on and sewed that side to the correct length."
4.0,They're definitely oversized which is what I wanted! Nice detailing on all four corners! The only issue I had with them is that they don't seem to stay up on the bridge in my nose very well and often slide down.
4.0,Color was brighter that picture and material thinner than expected yet still nice!
4.0,"These slippers are wonderful! They were a Christmas present, and the recipient thanked me gratefully, seeing as her hardwood floors were rather cold. They will keep your feet warm during the winter, and every other time of the year. I do have a couple of concerns, as the slippers were a little small. Not too small, for when I pass by her house on the way to work, I often see her come out on to the cement and wave to me, all the while wearing her new Women's Animal Coral Snoozies. They are a tad small, but I do indeed recommend getting this wondrous pair of slippers."
4.0,If you wear a medium make sure you order at least two sizes up. Runs small. Other than that it is good product.
4.0,Cute but itchy material in arms
4.0,"Nice hat all in all, happy with it."
4.0,"I have some issues keeping it an off the shoulder dress, but if you have smaller shoulders it should work fine."
4.0,"Looks just like the pictures, you can tell it's not high quality by the feel of the fabric but it isn't see through and should hold up. Very pretty and elegant."
4.0,Seems to work just fine
4.0,"Muy lindo, espero no se ponga feo"
4.0,The Top Hat is good. as a costume. üòÄ
4.0,"I used this pack over the weekend for an overnight 15.6 mile round trip, strenuous hike to Mt. LeConte in the Smoky Mountains.  For full disclosure, I‚Äôm not an experienced backpacker, and am not an appropriate source for reviewing the fit of the backpack.  My shoulders were quite sore after each leg of the trip so I don‚Äôt think the straps were properly adjusted.  What I can confidently review is the storage capacity and arrangement of the pockets.<br />Overall, I was quite pleased with the function of the pack.  The straps were adequately padded and did not cut into my shoulders.  The main compartment of the pack is accessible from both the top opening and closes with a draw string, and has a zipper for access from the front.  It easily stored 3 changes of clothes, a camera bag, lunch for two days, and a toiletry bag with some room to spare.  Somewhat separated from the main compartment is bottom chamber that has zipper access.  I found this useful for storing a 3 lite water bottle.  I did not use the side bladder chamber.  The top pocket already contains the pack‚Äôs rain cover so I stored my additional rain gear there.  Having access to the bottom chamber and the main chamber without having to unpack everything from the top was very convenient.<br />Admittedly, this was a bit overkill for my short trip, but I had room to spare.  I think this pack will serve me well in the future, but quite a bit of that will depend on me getting the proper fit.  I received this product at a discount."
4.0,Very warm and comfortable and fits well. I'm a size 10 1/2 purchased a 10 and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"The pink was more bubblegum than the description photo. It's very thin and stretchy.  It wrinkles out of the dryer,  but they go away if c you hang it up immediately.  It's junior sizing. I'm 5' 4 and 155. Bought xl"
4.0,I ordered a size 10 and normally wear a medium.  It doesn't fit as loose as I was expecting and it is too tight to do the buttons in the back and still look nice.
4.0,I took one star away because of the shape of the ring is not stable for septum piercings; it always falls to one side
4.0,Looks good and easy installation
4.0,"Had a very strong smell upon opening, but went away quickly after the first wash."
4.0,Good band but not really for my watch.
4.0,"I bought this onesie to wear for a squid costume one year. It ended up being so warm and comfy I now enjoy wearing it around in the winter. Also, who doesn't love pockets? The only downside is the feet are really big (even though I have average size feet - 8 in womens). Oh well!"
4.0,"What a fun dress! I am between 8-10 petite; I ordered an XL. It was too large in the waist/chest area = having it altered. The material is a nice cotton-based blend. The length on my 5'3"" frame is past the knees even with a petticoat on."
4.0,"Absolutely adorable dress!  The fabric is relatively weighty and has some stretch, the ruffles and the buttons took this dress over the top, loved them. In terms of length, it is perfect, it hit me at just above the knee (I am 5'9).  The only problem for me is that is was a bit high waisted since I am so tall.  It was perfect in every other way but it was just a bit high in the waist."
4.0,"My 7yr old niece loved this watch! It took us time to figure out how to set the correct time and date. All in all it's a good watch for kids. My niece uses everything on the watch even the calculator! She loves taking selfies. Unfortunately, she accidentally hit the screen while on the jungle gym at school and the screen cracked. The watch still works fine. Something like this is inevitable, things happen."
4.0,super cute & simple love them doesn't  look cheap fast delivery pleased so far. i only wear studs so i was pleased
4.0,Have to adjust the straps in back because I ordered a little larger and when I bend over or move the wrong way my breasts fall out. OOPSIE!
4.0,"not bad, good for golf"
4.0,Love this skirt! I ordered it to wear at a wedding and was pleasantly surprised that the quality was so good! The color is perfect and I got tons of compliments on it! I may order it again in another color.
4.0,"i'm 5'9"" and 130 lbs so i bought the small. it's the tiniest bit too big on me, but i think it would fit most people who usually wear a small fine. it doesn't look cheap and the material is good quality. the fit is good, but i have a small chest size (32A) and it would look better if i could fill it out a bit more... it's still cute. i did see a previous review mentioning the same thing, so i bought an adhesive push-up bra. i would suggest the same thing if you're smaller chested like i am. i bought the dress in white, and it will definitely be my go-to bridal shower/party dress from now on."
4.0,I loved the colour and quality. Worked perfectly for my dark matron. The inner lining of one sleeve was sewed in upside down. If I had more time I would have exchanged it. Thankfully I was able to fix it really easily with a seam ripper and restitch
4.0,Great fit  and comfy. I can fit a base layer underneath the pants as well for when it‚Äôs cold.
4.0,HOT
4.0,"Very pretty, but did not receive the cleaning cloth"
4.0,Obviously it is a loose fitting dress but super cute if you like this style.
4.0,Great fit but came with little tears on the seems. Other than that I love them.
4.0,"Good quality but this new one is a bit smaller than previous years. We have ordered this style multiple years as they are great hats (but they disappear on ski trips, camping, etc. ). The material is still high quality, warm, blocks wind.  They are just a little smaller/shorter than in the past."
4.0,"This veil is beautiful, but a bit stiff. I missed that ‚Äúgold‚Äù part, and thought I was just getting a white veil. I had to return it because I didn‚Äôt want gold."
4.0,Nice coat and fits well. Also feels like it will be really warm.The zipper looks a little flimsy but aside from that I think I will really enjoy this coat.
4.0,Material is comfortable and light for working out in though it is a little sheer.
4.0,fits as I excepted.
4.0,Me agrado much√≠simo y la uso para el gymm y estar en casa.
4.0,"This was a gift for my teenage son.  I like to steal it.<br />Not a bad Bluetooth speaker hat for the price.  Sound quality isn't amazing, but comparable to ear buds given it's sitting inside a hat.<br />Controls can be difficult to use if you remove the unit for washing or charging.<br />Pairs quickly, good volume.<br />The hat is nice and warm.<br />I'd recommend."
4.0,It is a very nice shirt. My husband loves it. It does run a little too big.
4.0,"It's hard to find sports bras for the big girls. The 3x fit my 40Es great. They aren't 100%supportive, but they aren't at all restricting. I won't be doing jumping jacks, but yoga and walking they do the job."
4.0,"These fit really well. I got a size 0-2, since I usually wear 0-1 pants and these fit perfectly. The bottom part of the leg is sort of a boot fit, so it's nice that its not really baggy down there, but also not too tight so I could wear a thermal underneath it. They aren't perfectly waterproof though, unfortunately. When I went behind a waterfall in Iceland, I felt some water seeping in to the pants. They do block rain pretty well, though, just not torrential downpour."
4.0,Like the material - slightly snug but not bad- pretty accurate sizing
4.0,"Love it, just took too long to receive it"
4.0,"Based on reviews, I ordered a large instead of a small and it fit me perfectly, albeit a little short for my 5'7&#34; frame.  I love everything about this dress."
4.0,"XL is wide as a truck, as expected, but we had to order it that large to get the sleeves to be long enough to fit a 5'10&#34; lady. Sleeves are just the right length (before washing). We took in each side by 2.25&#34; (folded), and trimmed up the arms down to the cuff. So - after alteration, narrowing the chest circumference by 9&#34;, it's really nice, although the neck of an XL is also really loose, not as shown on model. The material is a bit light but not see-through, and soft inside. Sure, we'd do it again, but only because we have a sewing machine. :)"
4.0,"Strap is the highest quality of any strap I have bought in my life, but took a star off because the included tool was cheaply made and useless and the replacement pins were the wrong size (for 15mm strap) and useless."
4.0,Dress was nice but went with another style.
4.0,"Nice color, soft fabric, washed well.  I'm 5'5&#34;, 145lbs, 34D-32-41 and I ordered the large.  It fits well.  If you have bigger boobs than me, I would not recommend.  The bottom button is pulling a bit."
4.0,"I purchased these for my 5yo son.  He really enjoys them.  However,  we tested how well it blocks with a lighter.  He was able to blow out the fire with the mask on."
4.0,Fits as expected. It can be dressed up or down. Solid material.
4.0,"This is a very comfortable dress, but when I washed it it shrunk a lot. I think it‚Äôs 4 ‚Äú shorter. I‚Äôm going to try to iron it out to see if it makes a difference."
4.0,"My mom is a size 12/14 but had to return the 14 , too small. Size 16 fit her well... You must order up in size.. Nice material."
4.0,"I really liked this set; received lots of compliments on it; looks just like the picture.  Only reason I didn't give it a five is because I thought it would be a lighter gold, it's a little darker than I like but for the price great steal"
4.0,These are cute. I bought 2 pair. Different colors!
4.0,"The cocoon organizers are well worth having. They allow you to place all the little ""do dads"" that are required for traveling with your technology into a single, organized place. They hold firmly, and are easy to get to. Keeps the ""spaghetti bag"" from becoming a real mess resulting in damage to your toys."
4.0,Gorgeous but the rhinestones don‚Äôt last long.
4.0,It really is a cute piece.
4.0,A little heavy but work well
4.0,"Loved it with my outfit,brought out the black dress,thanks"
4.0,"I went with my usual size and everything but the length fits beautifully. There‚Äôs a bit of stretch around the chest and shoulders, so it moves with you without riding up.<br /><br />Now, before I get into the shortness comments, I‚Äôll qualify: I live in short dresses, so I wasn‚Äôt concerned when purchasing that it would be too short for me. Generally when I read reviews stating how short something is, I don‚Äôt get concerned enough to not buy.  However. This is different. Without bending over, from behind you can see my underwear as I walk. Standing still it‚Äôs ok, sitting it rides up preeeettty far. Forget bending over.<br /><br />There‚Äôs a chance I may have received a bad cut, but be warned that it‚Äôs not as long as the images lead you to believe.<br /><br />I‚Äôll keep it and wear leggings with it, but this is short even for me."
4.0,Jacket fit well.
4.0,Fits great - I ordered the XL and am only 5'3&#34; but need a large bust size.  The length was perfect for a dress for me.
4.0,Pretty style and nice color can‚Äôt beat the price<br />Shows up nicely with longer hairstyles.
4.0,I love this sweater. I especially like the fact that the zips off center which give it a different look than most zip up sweatshirts.
4.0,"I will not wear this to workout.  The bra has no support, and no lining at all.  The shorts fit well and don't pull up in the crotch.<br /><br />What will I use this for? Maybe for yoga or stretching."
4.0,The fit is good and the shorts are pretty comfortable.  I did not have any pilling of the fabric or shrinkage after washing. These shorts are slightly see-through so I will only use them at home.
4.0,"They are extremely high waisted, I end up rolling down the waist band.  They are also smaller than expected, but still fit OK.  Decent quality material though, not too thick so they aren't too hot to wear."
4.0,The shirt is a little thicker cotton than I was hoping for. The vinyl is not distressed like I was hoping for. It‚Äôs slightly more bold than the picture appears. And it‚Äôs a little longer than I typically would buy.  It does seem to be a high quality shirt and vinyl design  I think with wear and tear it will be a great tank top. It‚Äôs just so BRAND NEW looking instead of faded and distressed like the picture.
4.0,"Good fit, nice look. Well worth for the price."
4.0,The size is right. Fro a 14 year old.
4.0,Great fit! The color does look more purple than grey in the picture.
4.0,"Arrived much earlier than expected which was great, but the product was large. I measured the sweater and the length was about 3 feet (36 inches) unwashed. The material was very comfortable and warm, but was very large on me (I'm about 5'3).<br /><br />Edit: Futurino got in contact with me and were extremely helpful. They helped me work out a way for a refund for this product. Great customer support!"
4.0,Excellent fit<br />update to 1st review after the 2nd wear the on side of the strap came loose. changing star rating due to the quailty
4.0,"Very heavy weight, which can be good or bad, depending."
4.0,"The 18 inches in length is measured not including the wheels and handle. Including then makes it 19.5 inches. My airline doesn't allow over 18 inches, so this was a bit disappointing. The suitcase itself is very pretty and decent quality."
4.0,"So far this is the only bib that will contain my little one's constant spit up.  only problem is they are so expensive!  other than that, they are great...super absorbent, soft fabric, washes well.  I like that there are 2 snaps at the neck so you can adjust the size.  The elastic around the neck is perfectly sized to fit her right now...she is 4 months old.  I wish they sold in bulk and it would be nice if they came out with cute designs.  Also the color is pretty true to the picture...very dark purple. But it works well for hiding darker stains."
4.0,I ordered this and received a different brand. I ordered this same cardigan before and loved it. This particular one (navy) was slightly bigger than the burnt orange. But hey...better than too small. Still super soft though.
4.0,So far it has held up well I never take it off .
4.0,Good qualities easy use
4.0,Very beautiful watch. Recommendable.
4.0,"Great color, just ran small."
4.0,"Low cost and fit my glasses so I'm good. Not a 5 star because the fit is not perfect, but functional."
4.0,I really liked the outfit. My only compliant is that the green ‚Äúscales‚Äù easily rubbed off with gentle use. Just from my daughter sitting she has two big black spots where her butt cheeks are.
4.0,"This belt is great.  I use it for jeans.  Most belts are now very, very long  to accommodate larger sizes.  For those of use who have remained smaller, it is difficult to find that fits, or is resizable without a lot of expense.  Works well."
4.0,Otherwise it was fine.  I appreciate the fast service.
4.0,These are amazing earrings.  I plan to wear these for years!
4.0,Simple digital watch!
4.0,I needed the instructions and didn‚Äôt receive any
4.0,would buy them again
4.0,somewhat small and need tape for breast area
4.0,"I'm not a big fan of mask but this did work when needed. Difficult to breath in, but aren't they all."
4.0,Taps are great and easy to install !  Make sure you ensure they include the nails
4.0,They are very nice I love the push button feature to open the one side The only issue I had was the red one is not really read it's more of a Brown wood color
4.0,It's really form fitting but beautiful.
4.0,Love the look of theses earrings. They are light weight and identical to advertised images!
4.0,"I needed a chemise for a costume party, and I only had 2 days to put an outfit together.  This was basically the only I chemise could find online that would get delivered in time.  I was expecting a thick/stiff mostly-cotton fabric, but this shirt is thin fabric with a satin sheen.  The thin smooth fabric actually worked out perfectly under a lace-up bodice, and the elastic arm bands add a nice romantic look."
4.0,"The size is accurate and it fits well. The fabric is soft but it is thin. The dress was fairly long prior to washing but is just below the knee, in front, after washing. I'm 5'1"""
4.0,"These are very large. My taste is more conservative, so I am sending them back. But they are well-made and light/comfortable."
4.0,"I got this from my Saved list to replace an older hat that is no longer in service. It has served it's time honorably and with full devotion. It was a darker green, like forest green I guess. I may be at fault. I washed it in the washing machine which finally broke it's battle worn body. The front of the bill is exposed and the fabric over it is frayed. I know there's a 'look' for hats, but that is trashy. It has provided countless hours of light blockage as well as looking good on my head.<br />This new hat fits perfectly. Probably just out of a production run and training (I have no idea how extensive hats are trained but....) this hat must be at the top of his/her (?) class. It looks great! Must have some really good genetics. Will have to do a test later and seek interview with previous model. He/she must have taken good care of himself/herself. It's sturdy (lots of endurance and some strength training). I'm looking to get a Combat Medic Badge patch to put on it. I'm holding off since we've just met and it hasn't been a month. Don't want to rush things."
4.0,"this is a very elegant  clutch .have many compartment for cards and ids. but i hate the smells,until now the smell still there,i had this for like 3 weeks or so..i put cotton with perfume but no use...i hope the seller will do something about the smell...smells like gas..my 4 stars is for the quality and design ,,,"
4.0,Semi acceptable quality for when you want to wear your PV but don't want to mess up or loose the real thing.  Nothing like actual quality of real ones.
4.0,"It was delivered on time, is a nice pair of glasses, you see the lights yellow, you can see better with the glasses that without them, and the case probably last forever."
4.0,Like what it says more than how it is made.
4.0,It's wonderful and useful.  I wish I could shorten it more.
4.0,This was an impulse buy for a friend who loves crabs. It arrived quickly and was adorable!<br /><br />It's hooked on her bag and gets a lot of positive attention.<br /><br />Would buy again.
4.0,Fits we but discrepancy in the color
4.0,"These sunglasses are nice looking and came with a protective sleeve. I got the mirror blue ones and they look great! The plastic on the ear pieces as well as the nose makes them very comfortable. The higher bridge does end up touching my face, it is not uncomfortable or anything, just a little weird. They are very lightweight but have been durable so far.<br />The description is a little confusing as it states they are ‚Äúnon-polarized‚Äù but then a few rows down it states ‚ÄúPolarized Mirror Lenses‚Äù. These are NOT polarized. They do a decent job of keeping the sun out of your eyes, but again-not polarized.<br />I received the WearMe Pro¬Æ ‚Äì Premium Mirror Lenses at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"It's a really good looking vest, very smart looking! BUT it's bit ROOMY, and I say this as a man who's 6'0"" 210lbs of solid muscle. Seriously, I'm in REALLY good shape, think Captain America build. I wore this over top of a polo shirt and the shoulders have A LOT OF give to them (and I've got BROAD shoulders)... this is one of those things that I think that going a size down would be ok, but ONLY if you're looking to wear this with one layer under it. If you're wearing this over a jacket, go with your normal size.<br /><br />The vest has an interesting thick pad at the back of the neck. It's NOT lightweight, it has a bit of drag to it, I hope that it won't be waterlogged in the rain, if so, this thing will be ""heavy"".<br /><br />Sadly one of the elastic bands on the side for the radio pocket snapped on DAY ONE! üò† However, for me, it wasn't a deal breaker. Just saying, the darn thing... snapped!"
4.0,The size was bigger than those written on the size chart.
4.0,little larger than expected but still love it
4.0,The material is a little thin but I put a tank top underneath and it was fine.
4.0,A little smaller than I thought... But very pretty. Good for everyday wear.
4.0,Good quality and good socks
4.0,"Thought it would have been a little bigger on the spikes, but other than that it works for me"
4.0,"The earing are pretty and lightweight.  But I don't like how the loop fits in my ear.  It hangs down lower than I thought they would and the loop does not seem right, I ended up bending the loop so the earing fit better."
4.0,"Good quality bracelet. Thought the beads are HUGE. I cannot wear it, it looks ridiculous, but it's good quality and I use it more as Mala beads..."
4.0,Love this purse! Many compliments on it!
4.0,These sunglasses are super comfortable on your face. They protect your eyes from the sun and I just love there color. If you love something with a sparkle these sunglasses are for you.
4.0,Love this little dress! I knew it was a thin stretchy dress but it was sooo long and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11!! It was past my knees! However I had it hemmed and wore it for Christmas!
4.0,"Very nice bag, good quality.  Love the multi-colors.  High recommend for all seasons.  Excellent price.  Lots of compliments on this one"
4.0,"Very well made. I like the way it fits in the front pocket, don't even notice it."
4.0,"I love these. Theyre a little hard to clean in the edges on the back of the star shell, but they‚Äôre light and they look great."
4.0,"nice design, looks intricate"
4.0,"The chart was incorrect, too large"
4.0,I liked them but was not able to use them since they were the wrong size since the listing did not state the gauge.
4.0,This was a replacement for one purchased two years ago. It is not as thick as the original one purchased.
4.0,This is a sexy chain.I like
4.0,The shipping was terrible.  I have prime and it arrived the week after.  But I love the product.
4.0,"First....this is NOT a sweatshirt. It's just a long sleeve tshirt with a hood. Also,  no pockets which ruins the functionality of a hoodie for me. However, as just a long sleeve tshirt,  this is fine. It wears well and doesn't look too sloppy. I do like the colors as well."
4.0,"I really like these shirts, the price is great for the quality and the fit. Just as good as the Nike but half the price."
4.0,Amazing detail in this key chain! Had it on my keys for about two weeks before the chain broke. Bummed but could have been a faulty chain. If you love Yami I'd reccomend this!
4.0,My 17 year old grandson just loved it amd it worked well!
4.0,Mine has not blinked once.
4.0,I like dress. Should have ordered large instead of extra large. For money I am satisfied.
4.0,"This is a great little dress, only wish it was a bit longer but I love the fabric, color and the pockets!"
4.0,"Great quality looking shirt. From what I can tell (out of the box), it is a pretty accurate fit-but only because of previous reviews. I am 6‚Äô 2‚Äù 195 lbs. and normally wear a large. The sleeve length is always an issue because I have long arms. I ordered an XL and it fits great through shoulders, chest and mid section. Length overall is good (not too long, not too short), but the sleeves (length) just makes the cut. I wouldn‚Äôt want them any shorter. Many may want to consider ordering at least 1-size larger, if not two, than you normally wear."
4.0,"Really good sock, I wear a pair daily for work."
4.0,The product description is accurate and the quality is good.
4.0,"Beautiful embroidery purse, but it came with noticeable defects, inside and on the back of th purse. It is bigger than a wristlet that I‚Äôm used to, I would order a smaller one."
4.0,"Got these to sleep in, and they work pretty well. My only gripe is that they don't have a fly"
4.0,Excellent product. I use these for making fridge magnets. They work perfectly and look great.
4.0,Quick delivery & product as expected!
4.0,I love the colors! And the quantity for the price is wonderful.  They're a bit delicate but that would only be a problem if your glasses weighed a ton.<br /> :)
4.0,"Excelente calidad del producto, solo que las tallas vienen muy reducidas, mi hija es peque√±a y aun asi le qued√≥ muy chica la prenda pero creo que es cuestion de saber elegir y acostumbrarse a estas tallas"
4.0,I wasn't expecting that small of a package.<br />This top is as shown. I wish there was sizes instead one size only.<br />It fit me well. I am 5.1 inch tall and I am 34C/D bra. If you are taller or bigger than medium this top will not work .<br />The one star I took off becouse sizing should was explained.<br />I was lucky and it worked out for me.<br />It is beautiful if you layer it with bralet or bustie top . I like it.
4.0,"I expected this to be a little looser around the sleeves, and slimmer around the neckline. it's still cute , must wear something under it as it is see through."
4.0,Like that the pants have two pockets when so many yoga pants don't
4.0,I like that they have a fashion look. I don‚Äôt like the frame though.
4.0,Bought the XS for my 4 year old and it‚Äôs huge looks like it could fit him in about 2 years and he‚Äôs a good sized boy but he loves it and never wants to take it off so it‚Äôs a win for me!
4.0,Nice looking - would have preferred a carbine stock to go with the barell or a longer barrel to match the stock but my daughter likes it.
4.0,"Like it a lot, but is way too big and doesn't look like the picture. Although it was not exactly what I expected, I love it."
4.0,Im very surprise that dress fits me a little big. I am very hippy and I love the way the dress flows on me .. The top is a lil open for my body size but i plan on wearing a lace shirt under it .. I cant wait to wear it out
4.0,"The fit is great. Material is ""different"". May want to line dry or use delicate on the dryer. They seemed to shrink a little. I'm still very happy with them."
4.0,I know the cost isn‚Äôt that much but I wish the band print would have not looked cheap.
4.0,"Pretty good price for the two together, bearing in mind that the elf suit is all polyester, not mostly cotton like the ""cozie fleece"" version you can buy separately. Run small though. My 10 mo old is 22 lbs and 29 inches, should fit in a 12 mo size per the zutano size chart, and wears that in most brands. The onesie just barely fits her body and the sleeves hit over an inch above her wrists. The fleece suit fits her OK in the upper body, can just barely fold over the wrist cuffs, but the legs are a little short and I definitely can't fold over the footies. Luckily I only need it for one week (traveling to cold weather for Christmas but otherwise live in SoCal), so I'll just stick some booties on her and she'll be good for in the carseat. If I needed it for longer would definitely return for a bigger size."
4.0,Just what I needed as a backdrop for my mask.
4.0,I love these gloves..  I gave a pr 2 my son & my sister & I have a pr..  They loved them..
4.0,"I used this for our school's Halloween parade and the kids loved it!  It fit as expected and I have a fairly large head. :)  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had to tie up the braids on the side.  They weren't standing up like the picture showed, but that was an easy fix with colorful ribbon."
4.0,Really nice but very thin
4.0,I use this product for working.
4.0,"I am 5'5 160lbs, 36DDD and I max out the medium. I actually wish it was thinner, I saw other reviews complaining that it was thin but..its not. The hood was comically big for me so I removed it but the sherpa collar is very cute. It also has cute accents on the back to tighten if needed."
4.0,"Cute ring and the stones all seem secure. My only complaint is that the top prongs are quite pointy and like to catch on things. Other than that, it is a really pretty ring."
4.0,Nice sweater. nice quality. but too small for me. I am  size 8 and fit the measurements provided. luckily my daughter liked it. she is a size 2. It fits her loosly like the picture. But her arms are shorter so the unzipped sleeve doesn't goes past her elbow. so she wears it zipped.
4.0,Well it is Halloween time! The band is just as good and comfortable as an original Apple band. It will be my everyday until sometime in November!
4.0,"This is an inexpensive dress and is great for a low key party. I mean it‚Äôs not great quality, but it‚Äôs good for the price. At least it‚Äôs lined."
4.0,It's a little tight but other than that the dress is gorgeous!
4.0,"I say almost perfect, and not 5 stars because it‚Äôs rediculously long when using the shoulder strap. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and the purse hangs to my thigh‚Ä¶ umm bit to long üòù. I have the strap in the last hole possible so it‚Äôs as short as it will go. The strap is in last position / last hole and the left over strap hangs past the clip, that is very uncomfortable and ridiculous looking as well. Otherwise I love the purse, exactly as shown. It‚Äôs extremely sturdy leather, it should hold up for a while. Love the tri colors (blush / rose gold, off white and black)."
4.0,The bags r great. Just wish the tote was a little bigger
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece.  Well crafted and designed.  Good vivid color.  Only drawbacks are lack of control over speed of color change.  Changes just a bit too quickly.  Also, an on/off button would make it perfect.  As is, you tqist the top on and off.  Still, the spectacle is a good thing to behold."
4.0,Comfortable dresses for the holidays
4.0,looks great on. but some of the links get loose from time to time.
4.0,comfortable and warm and for my height they are not crops.. Love  them...Second pair.
4.0,Too narrow for a typical large
4.0,Muy buen material lo √∫nico que el silicon me deja marcas profundas en la piel
4.0,cute booties
4.0,read reviews and ordered the size 9 (I am an 8 1/2 size shoe)  Fit perfectly and are just what I wanted for swimming at the pool.
4.0,Very beautiful bag for the price and like it. Nicely packed. The little thing that why I didn't put 5 star it because the length of the hand bag it's too long
4.0,"I actually do like this skirt. Did not realize it was pleated. But it has a boho feel to it. I am a size 8 and I got the medium. the waist fits me just right, I do wish there was a little less fabric, however it is not a big deal. It goes down to my knees (and i am short at 5'0). I would of liked it better if there were no pleats but I plan on keeping it and wearing it anyways."
4.0,This chain is very very thin and light.  I bought it for one of my light weight pendants.  I wore it around the house yesterday to see if it would hold up.  The end clasp is NOT as pictured.  It is a very small ring and I'm not sure how secure it will be.
4.0,Pretty wrap but too light and whimsical for mr. I was hoping for a little protection from the chill of AC or outdoors. I returned it.
4.0,"Yellow and multi color lenses seem to be big, but they will in fact fit if you install the middle first. good for biking.<br />the black and clear fit best. making a  nice pair of safety glasses or polarized fishing glasses."
4.0,I bought a size up after reading all the reviews but will need to adjust the strap around the neck.
4.0,It shows the collar in the picture but when it arrived it didn‚Äôt have the collar which I don‚Äôt mind but still
4.0,"Runs too tight/small, but I loved the color and fabric so I ordered the next size up. Fingers crossed that it fits."
4.0,"It's cute,  I ordered xl could of used a little more room in the bust area."
4.0,fits nicely
4.0,"My daughters cant really use earrings because of their allergies, and these are a great solution. They love the watermelon and whale ones, very nice colors. Also, it is very comfortable and I have heard no complains from them!"
4.0,"Once you get the hang of it, that is putting on, is great"
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Made well and fits great
4.0,I really love the shoes and they fit exactly how they were supposed to fit. I broke my ankle wearing these but that's my life.
4.0,"Bought these on a lightning deal for under $40. They did very well while using them in Alaska. I didn't notice a quality difference between these and my Smith goggles that cost more than double.<br /><br />My only complaint us that the body is somewhat flimsy once the lenses are removed. However, they handled everything I threw at them on the mountains of AK.<br /><br />I did experience some fogged up lenses as well once my body started to warm up and produce some heat. Any one who says a pair of goggles never fogs up is lying. At some point they all do, at least in my experience. For what I paid they have performed admirably.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!"
4.0,Just what you need in summer.
4.0,I travel often and I have a lot of trouble with back and knee issues. I wanted a suitcase that was light and maneuverable. It‚Äôs definitely light. Every now and then the wheels catch so I‚Äôll see what happens on my next trip.
4.0,Great all purpose blouse
4.0,"I am 6'2"" with a pretty long torso, broad shoulders and a broad chest and have had a terrible time finding t-shirts that fit me well. Large shirts are too short and usually not quite proportioned for my chest/shoulders while XL shirts are usually long enough, but end up being baggy. My go to has been Large Tall (LT) shirts from retailers like J.Crew but they still don't fit great with my shoulders and are still a tiny bit too short.<br /><br />The Amazon shirts fit me pretty well, even after a few wash and dry cycles. I would love the ability to tweak the length dimension slightly, but overall, I don't have any major complaints about the fit.<br /><br />I ordered both the medium and light weight shirts to see the difference. Both medium and light weight shirts are super soft and stretchy and feel great on your skin. Amazon's definition of medium weight is most retailers definition of light weight, while the light weight shirts are REALLY light weight. Even with the custom sizing (which is great), it's hard to justify spending $25 for the light weight shirt since it seems like it probably cost $2 to make and isn't going to last too long. The medium weight shirts seem like they'll be a little more durable.<br /><br />I really wish they offered these without tags and also in a wider variety of colors."
4.0,"They fit well once they are on, but the top is a little tight going over my foot, and I am thin.  Love the pattern and bright colors.  Really cute."
4.0,I like the way the dress moves.  It feels light and summery.  The color i selected looks good with my light tan.
4.0,I really loved this top it‚Äôs comfortable and cute.
4.0,Very happy with the fit and material of this shirt.  Love the message too! :)
4.0,This dress is second best to begin naked - I love it! I ordered an extra large and I probably would have looked really good in a medium. But its perfect for lounging around the house and looking really cute thanks to the off shoulder cut. The fabric is soft and feels like pretty good quality. I have a baby and she's been pulling at it and no rips so far. I will definitely order more and in smaller sizes.
4.0,I got it for the art. So it‚Äôs on the wall!!! Hahaü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4.0,"Bigger than I was picturing, I love it! One of the pins completely poked through the stopper and ripped my package which was kind of a bummer but it looks nice in my collection!"
4.0,Great gift and they look great.
4.0,"I love them, beautiful design and brilliant created gemstone and outstanding  CZ. 6carat, 10x8mm ideally big size! Love it, I wish they have a little bit thick handle."
4.0,Lots of fun comments.
4.0,"These run just a tad small - purchased the 6-12 month size for my 5 month old and they‚Äôre none too big! I will have to size up if I purchase again. My little one CAN actually get these off if he really tries, but they stay on 1000x better than any other baby socks we have tried. They pill a little, but I do machine wash & dry, both high heat. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the socks."
4.0,Decent for the price.. serves the purpose..
4.0,"I've had this watch for around 4 months now. It has been easy to change the time/date with the crown, and it has received a few compliments from some of my friends. The strap started off a bit stiff and has formed to my wrist nicely. I work in a restaurant with poor lighting. The hands and dial have parts that glow in the dark and help me read the time quickly. The stainless steel polishes easily with my shirt and I can wash my hands without getting nervous about water spots.<br /><br />My only complaint with this watch is the strap. The leather loop that holds down the excess leather can slip, and became a nuisance for me after awhile. Luckily I had a leather sewing needle and some thread, so I fixed the loop into the main strap and that isn't an issue anymore. I have also noticed part of the strap's lining underneath the black leather starting to peel. I can probably fix it someday with some super glue, but it has definitely become noticeable to me since I use the watch often.<br /><br />All in all, a great deal for what I got. I'd buy it again."
4.0,Cute coverup! Not the best quality but worth it for the price! I would buy again!
4.0,The watchband is very cute and the ‚Äúbling‚Äù is subtle and not over the top.  I really like how easy it is to put on and take but for me I t‚Äôs not comfortable to wear all day.  I would recommend it for women with small/medium wrists and not for women with medium/large wrists.
4.0,I loved how fast the delivery was!! I did have some problems trying to get the top grill to fit but overall I am satisfied.
4.0,"Somewhat small because for a regular 8 by 11.5 I think printed paper it will curl the corners of the paper because the bag is slightly small so that it‚Äôs kinda inconvenient. Then at first for awhile it was waterproof, but it‚Äôs less waterproof now a year after. However my bag has never gotten wet on the inside so my work and stuff doesn‚Äôt get wet which is very nice. I love the extra components and pockets. The water bottle holders on the sides are able to fit a water bottle, however if you have a medium load of stuff inside your bag you rly can‚Äôt put your bottle in the holders. You‚Äôd have to resort to putting it inside the bag if you have enough room."
4.0,"this is a pretty dress but runs small.  Not flattering on me so I am returning it.<br />Yes, you would need a slip under it because of lightweight fabric."
4.0,Pros:<br />Compatible with Fitbit<br />Looks amazing<br />Adjustable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can be uncomfortable due to it‚Äôs adjustable size
4.0,Purchased this because it matched a tattoo a friend has it hangs on my review mirror on my car looks so cool
4.0,"came in great shape,my little brother loves nintendo so this was a no brainer gift for him."
4.0,"If you‚Äôre like me, someone who scans through the product information; please read!!! You only get one! I thought it was a package of three."
4.0,I really like this sweater and would probably buy another one....I am 5'3&#34; and weigh about 155 and the Large fits well...just a little extra room...so I would maybe even do an XL to have it be big. The green in the picture is NO WHERE CLOSE to the green I got which is like mashed peas.
4.0,"I like gym and running so my legs are pretty muscular and the socks are a bit higher than my knees, my height is 5,2 btw. Recommend for skinny people. P. S. Colors look great and socks are really cute!!"
4.0,Cute and comfy!! Excited to wear at upcoming tailgate. Go Owls
4.0,"Very nice piece the only draw back is the cost, not worth the price"
4.0,"I absolutely love your suit but I‚Äôm usually a large so I ordered a large, and the top was way too big. The bottoms fit great. I‚Äôm sending it back and ordering a medium so I‚Äôm praying the bottoms will still fit. I am pretty disappointed that the medium doesn‚Äôt come in an orange."
4.0,"Great design, great quality, runs small!"
4.0,Love the product.  There is no room for stretching.  The first thing I did was measure my bust before I ordered.  There was no way that was going to fit me without ripping.  I believe the size runs small.
4.0,I really like it but I gave it a four stars because I wish the strap was long.  I like how the phone is on the outside and not in the inside with my cards. It came in handy when I went out of town. Did not have to carry a bulky purse.
4.0,"Hard to match with another color...appears blue, then green  when you put another color up against it"
4.0,"I‚Äôm typically a large, but I listened to all the comments saying order one size up, and I‚Äôm so glad I did! I ordered an XL and it fits great! Soft material too! Definitely order 1 size up!"
4.0,They fit well enough although long for my 5‚Äô6‚Äù‚Äù. The waist band is flimsy material and not the wide elastic of others I have purchased. I would say a medium weight at best.
4.0,They are fine just cheap earings that should cost less.
4.0,"Fits well.  I'm 5'4'' 150 lbs, hippy, and I ordered the medium."
4.0,"I'm always leery about buying strapless clothing because I hate having to constantly adjust a sagging bosom.  But this top seems pretty secure - I jumped around a bit and it didn't budge!  The print is cute.  I am borderline about the material though - it is a pretty thick, stretchy synthetic blend that I think may be quite hot!  Hence docking one star on the rating.<br /><br />I am 5'3"", 130lbs, 34D and 29"" waist and bought the small.  It fits perfectly and barely brushes the ground when I'm barefoot."
4.0,Got them for a gift.  They came in a nice box and look very nice.  I would order again.
4.0,"It is made really well and the material is not cheap.<br />However, there is lace in the armpits.<br />I bought a shirt just like this 5 years ago without lace in the armpits.<br />This is very scratchy and annoying in the armpits.<br />I‚Äôll have to cut it off."
4.0,These are nice and warm and thick. Good for wearing as &#34;pants&#34; or wearing under tunics and short dresses.
4.0,"Earrings Are Pretty...But They Are Heavy on the ear,<br />and kind of awkward to wear because of their size."
4.0,I bought this for my teen son who lost his father this summer.  Thought it would be nice to have to help him remember him.
4.0,"The material wrinkles very easily and it runs a little small but besides that, the dress is cute. The length isn't too short, the amount of cleavage isn't a lot.<br />For reference I'm 5'3, 140lbs and I got a medium."
4.0,"This is actually a very cute bracelet. I was a little unsure whether or not it would fit, even though the measurements are on the listing. It did take a little longer than I thought to arrive but once it got here I found it to be just as pretty as the pictures on the listing. It is a very nice little bracelet and I do wear it often since I have found myself to be wearing a lot of blue this season. There isn't much not to like about the bracelet. It fits well, is easy to put on, looks good with the outfits I pair it with. So far it has held up well to being worn a couple of days a week. I was concerned that the colored bead might lose its color with how often I wear it but so far the entire bracelet has not been a disappointment. It is a cute accessory that is light weight and I find that I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. Overall I am very pleased with this bracelet and think that I will purchase the others that are similar to this for upcoming birthdays and for the holidays."
4.0,Nice product for My active 2
4.0,"Lots of pockets and storage compartments. Great special perks, watch, mirror, flashlight, zippers, etc. Color is good, but not as gorgeous as a Michael Kors purse I was given, but much better price point!"
4.0,Very soft fabric. Looks great and fits well.
4.0,Held up through an entire baseball season. Son loved it.
4.0,Shrunk up after washing
4.0,"I like these leggings a lot! Im a yoga teacher and also the retail manager at a yoga studio that carries high end yoga brands, so Ive tried on LOTS of brands, styles, price points, etc.  These really inexpensive leggings are right on par with a lot of the brand that cost 4 times as much.  Super opaque, light weight enough for hot classes and have a really good smooth feeling.  My only complaint was that I am almost always a small in leggings(5'6', 138lbs, size 2-4 in pants) and these were a little bit big around my waist, hips and inner thighs. They probably aren't noticeably big to anyone else but I like my leggings to stay were they should and I had to pull these up a few times during practice.  Still a great legging though! Ordered the xsmall so Ill update once I get them."
4.0,My son loves these shoes.  They've held up fairly well but he's so hard on shoes that we probably won't make it past the summer but I'm still pleased with the purchase.
4.0,Ordered as agift.  Appears to be well made.
4.0,"these are great for working out or chores. They ride up the legs a bit, my thighs eat them. still comfy though!"
4.0,"Not the most comfortable,  but they're for showering so not sure anything would be better"
4.0,I saw this jacket after looking for a similar make often used by police and paramedics. It feels really warm even for 40 degree weather. The arms are long although the body run small. The only thing I wish it had was a zipper pocket on the sleeve and maybe vent zippers on the back hips to allow the jacket to open up more.
4.0,I purchased this suit primarily for the bottom. I plan to wear it with a different top. It seems really nice. Looks and fits just like the picture. I have not worn it in the water yet but it seems like typical swim suit material. I ordered a medium. I am 5'10 and 129 lbs and it fit perfectly. I may get it in other colors. I wish they had a pink color.
4.0,Purchased for my son who is 11 with size 6 feet. These are wayy too big in the foot and can fit my husband size 11 foot.
4.0,Good quality. Looked perfect with my outfit but runs a little small.
4.0,nice looking gloves.  look more expensive than the $30 i paid. fairly warm.  i wouldnt make snowballs with them but they get the job done.  only complaint is that the touch capability faded over time and became very difficult to impossible after 2 years.
4.0,"i liked the dress but i shoukd of bought a smaller size, i returned it."
4.0,"Great shirt, however sizing is a tad smallish."
4.0,It's a cute shirt
4.0,This shoes ar√© comfortable and cute at the same time. I wear them with skinny jeans or leggings..
4.0,"I am 5'9"", 135 and the small in this sweater is just a little too small. Sent it back. Feels super warm and good quality for the price."
4.0,I like that the end tucks inside the band. I had the other ones and I kept catching them and tearing them up
4.0,Super cute. Gotten many compliments.  Great price. Plating on stems does seem to be tarnishing with constant wear but my sensitive ears have had no reaction.
4.0,"The design is great and lovely. It is a bit wider than I thought, but I'm still pleased."
4.0,"I was surprised when these sunglasses came in and they did not quite fit my glasses.  I measured my glasses and matched it to the measurements given.  The width is fine, but the height (top to bottom) was smaller than my glasses.  I think this was because the measurement was not the glass size but included the clip.<br /><br />I've been able to make them work, but I wish this had been clearly stated in the description - I might have tried to find something larger.<br /><br />But overall, they do the job of blocking the sun."
4.0,"They are. 925 sterling but 4 stars for not matching the picture. They're actually flat, not curved as shown."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3a8c1b505579c7b3e467f42e2439bc7b]] This is very gorgeous kurti set from Janasya! I would recommend to order a size up for the perfect fitting! I‚Äôm happy with my purchase, worth buying with this price!"
4.0,Just what I expected :)
4.0,"These arrived quickly and look awesome! They are a little tight, and I'm a small person (size 8) so perhaps it would benefit from sizes, but they fit well if I wear them at my natural waist and not my hips. It should be mentioned as well that they are dry clean only, something I did not know before I ordered. I just wash them in the sink instead of the washing machine."
4.0,I purchased the white dress for a courthouse wedding. Very good quality for the price. It's a little see through unfortunately so it needs a slip.
4.0,the weak point is ZIPPER easy to tear loose- they fold nice and flat when not used OR i prefer to keep 1 open with 2nd fold inside ready to go to store- the sides and bottom are very firm and hold shape well- i love the size just right for large container of greens which i buy often- i load 1 w/heavy items to top of bag (for support) and 2nd with lighter then stack/bungee on my cart and they ride perfect<br />looks like these will be the perfect bag for $30 to $50 of groceries
4.0,"I bought these because the purple color looked more hot pink than purple and I didn‚Äôt really look at the color just the picture ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èand I feel that sometimes the sellers say a color and it‚Äôs never really that color. Buuuuut that being said, these definitely are purple."
4.0,Runs a little big but beautiful and my granddaughter loves it. Excellent quality.
4.0,"I like the dress very comfortable. The skirt on the one I received has the elastic showing, so I will have to do something about that, and the length is not what I expected, I thought it would be like the picture and it actually hits me about the ankle. I am 5'6&#34; and ordered a medium."
4.0,Love the retro wash so incredibly comfortable however for me not flattering because of the way I'm built. (Thick waist) if u are hourglass shaped this are 100% u.  Also really wish they came with a belt tie of the same fabric might help define the waist a bit more for my body type.
4.0,"Very cute dress, runs small."
4.0,"I love the pin itself, I put it on my backpack and most of my others fell off but this one stayed on really well. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs a lot smaller than it looks, about 1/2‚Äù in diameter. Other than that it‚Äôs great!!"
4.0,It came out a lot longer than the photo have led me to expect.
4.0,These are fantastic socks.  The only reason I am discounting one star (I would actually give them a 4.5 if I could) is because they require serious effort to take on and off.  Once on they are amazing though...  highly recommend.
4.0,I got this for my 9 year old granddaughter who does ballet and she loves these tights.  She said they fit perfectly and is glad to have an extra pair.  The tights held their shape after washing and they were also washed in a machine and not just hand washed.
4.0,"Good purchase,  and DELIVERY on time!"
4.0,Comfortable and stylish. Not too thick so it can be worn year round. Pretty design.
4.0,"First off this is a plastic watch, the description says metal thats why I took off a star but ok it looks good. When I bought it it said $11.37 and I found a discount code so it came out to $3.41. But as of today it‚Äôs listed price is $2.74.<br />Bought it March 9 arrived March 27"
4.0,Love it. Fits as expected. Not too sheer and very comfortable
4.0,These are great for motocross they grip very well.The only reason they get a 4 star is because of the price üòÇ
4.0,I received my wallet.  Very pretty and very nice.  A bit smaller than I expected but I think it will work out nicely.  I hope it protects my card from getting demagnetized.  The mount that I have in my vehicle comes with a magnet that mounts on my phone case and sticks to the round metal ball mounted in my truck. This magnet on my phone keeps stripping my  credit card.  Hope this does the trick.
4.0,"Super cute, great for Halloween costume but also for winter bunting. It did take an exceptionally long time to arrive (several weeks), so if you need it right away I‚Äôd buy a different product. I wasn‚Äôt in a rush, so it worked out for me."
4.0,It looks wonderful on. I'm very happy with this purchase.
4.0,comfy casual dress.
4.0,Love it! Looks exactly as pictured And is pretty good quality for the price!
4.0,I like this product.. just one problem.  Its go one size bigger than what you need
4.0,"The dress fit right, it wasn't thin as it seemed in the picture. The underwear line is however very noticeable so either go with seamless underwear or no underwear at all! The only downfall to this dress is that it easily gets lint. Other than that, it worked out great for me."
4.0,"The necklaces were beautiful and I loved them however after one day, the ring that holds the moon charm broke and the moon was lost. I‚Äôd love to talk to the seller for a replacement as my friend has the sun charm but now I‚Äôm without the second piece (which is the whole point).<br />Edited to add - customer service was fantastic!<br />I emailed them through Amazon and they sent me a replacement! Very happy with the attention they gave they issue!<br />And the two piece necklace really is beautiful. Look closely inside the charms for an unexpected surprise touch!"
4.0,"EHHH, not the best"
4.0,"When these arrived they were very comfortable and fit really well. Perfect hight for medium height boots. After a few months of washing(soft water and Tide detergent) they got a bit more stiff. Still comfortable but, rough enough that I got blisters when I went on a 3.5Mile hike. I have never had blisters before. Could be my boots or the washing. Overall very nice."
4.0,Rexeived the jumpsuit on time had emailed prior to the seller great service!Looks just as pictured. Loved it. It was stretchy and fit a little loose but still worked great. Make sure to look at size chart I'm 5'3 (145lbs) lg was good with stretch.I might have actually fit into the medium but didn't risk it
4.0,Lightweight. Well made. Fast shipping.<br />I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0‚Äù 185lbs. Ordered a medium. Fits perfectly. Not too tight. Not baggy.
4.0,Really beautiful for the money. I received a lot of compliments on it. People couldn't believer it was so inexpensive!
4.0,Cute but kind of small.
4.0,It‚Äôs ok for what it is. The color is a dirt magnet though. So just be aware that it picks up everything. At least the orange one does. Still affordable for the cost.
4.0,"This is the 2nd time ordering this dress, ordered 1st one in light brown. I am 5'6 145lbs size 6-10(US) depending on the brand, (hooray for vanity sizing). But I ordered large, because I dont like skin tight dresses, i could easily wear medium but this is a tshirt dress. So I wanted it to be a little t shirt like. And that exactly what I got. I will say each one is slightly different, my brown dress is slightly longer, than the green but that's not an issue, my cooter and tooter are still covered ü§£ I love them both. The material is thin, so wear it on a ""I feel skinny"" day or spanx on a ""I'm bloated chubby and hate my life, going back to be byt gimmie that taco"" day I'd buy it again but I dont need 3 of the same dress...just 2 ha"
4.0,Shirt is nice and comfy. I am 172lbs 5.7 height and I purchased an XL size. Watch out for tye colors though they are nothing like they look in the images
4.0,great product. This is my second one I bought. 1st one lasted more than a year. Would have given it a 5 but the left breast pocket is coming off.
4.0,"Only  complaint is a strong odor, not sure if it is the finish on the shoes or a protective coating, but it is nasty.  Hoping it will dissipate over time."
4.0,I usually wear a small with Amazon but I would go up a size if you have an average or large bust line
4.0,"This is a nice looking set.  Not the best quality, but what you would expect for the price range.  The earrings are way smaller than what they show on the picture, but they are very cute. I am satisfied with my purchase based on the price I paid."
4.0,"quality was a little lower than hoped, but adequate."
4.0,"Fits as expected, very comfortable material but the material is a bit seethrough. I bought the light blue. Maybe the darker ones wld be better. I‚Äôll prob wear around house because it‚Äôs so comfortable or over a swimsuit but not out:("
4.0,The top fits perfectly but the bottom seems to run small.
4.0,I would recommend them
4.0,Beautiful shirt. I did have a couple dark spots on it so hoping they come off in the wash.
4.0,Fits great ! I got a medium. I'm 5'3 145 lbs.
4.0,"Fits very well and is also very sturdy, I just wish it was a bit longer but other than that I love it"
4.0,"This is very pretty and sturdy. The color is beautiful, the chain is not delicate. It sits just below my collar bone."
4.0,Great fit and comfortable fabric! True to size and fits as expected.
4.0,"It's a great jacket for it's price. I've had it over a year and it's still holding up.<br /><br />Only downside is that the mesh liner on the inside of the jacket started getting a bit frayed almost immediately. It wasn't really designed to hold up against continuous rubbing against the leather interior side of the jacket, which is pretty rough. The liner has occasionally even become stuck to the jacket."
4.0,"I love this skirt! I wore it to a luau-themed bridal shower and received tons of compliments -- especially about the pockets! The skirt doesn't have belt loops, however, and putting anything in the pockets weighed it down and pulled it below the belt (no belt loops = no actual holding power). Lightweight and great for warm CA days."
4.0,"A beautiful. It arrived full of wrinkles, tho."
4.0,Would like them in black
4.0,Very nice Quality
4.0,"Interesting repurposing of an old tool. Please see the same item, a folding two-step stool, such as [[ASIN:B007EEG7M0 Range Kleen SS2 Double Step Stool, Gray]]"
4.0,"Loved the dress quality and the colors and wanted so much for it to fit. It turned out to be not as striking as the picture, but is very pretty and well made. But it's somewhat disproportional. I am 5.8 and size 8 of popular american brands fit me perfectly. The waist line on the dress was way too high and it was tight in the chest. Had to return"
4.0,I'm elderly and have problems getting my bracelets on love this
4.0,"My daughter loved this dress for St. Patrick's Day, but it was a one-day wear since the pizza she spilled on it will not come out (after half a dozen tries)."
4.0,"It's cute and came quickly,  but the locket part is rather thin & where the two meet was really stuck together and had to be bent to come apart."
4.0,These are pretty and fashionable. They are comfortable to wear and soft. Only thing is the material is thin so would not protect from covid 19 or any other virus such as the flu. You can wear a disposable mask underneath or a filter cloth to help with thickness. Positive for being thin is very easy to breath through.
4.0,Nice light weight fabric.
4.0,"My husband uses this to carry his scriptures and class materials to church, since he uses a cane.  It has all the necessary pockets, and seems to be working out just fine."
4.0,"Disappointed in the height, as they look shorter in the pic. Very nice quality though."
4.0,"It‚Äôs as I expected in every way, except I bought a hot Magenta hoodie and received a bubble gum pink. Very neon just not what I thought I was buying."
4.0,"Not too big, doesn't expand much but for the price it serves it's purpose well."
4.0,Easy to remove
4.0,I like it.  I guess I  didn't realize that it was open on the sides but it works and fits and I do like it.
4.0,My wife really liked it. I bought it for her for an upcoming wedding. Ordered a M she is 5'9 and athletic built and it fit her great
4.0,"Good cushion, but they just still wet when they come out of the dryer and everything else is dry."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. The neckline is a bit smaller . Keeps sliding up nd giving dress a one-hand look. Overall, not a bad purchase"
4.0,"I looked sexy in these, and dry as a bone and ready to go again a few hours later"
4.0,This was a good purchase. I accidentally received two of them. It was pretty good quality and I used it for awhile.
4.0,I usually wear large but ordered a size up (XL).  The fit /feel was slightly bigger than I expected but not noticeable.  I'm still very pleased with the fit. I later ordered a large and it fits well. I'm not sure that you necessarily need to order up a size from your usual fitting.
4.0,go one size large and you should be fine. good for lounging
4.0,Nice little chain. Super thin but my wife liked it. Said it made her locket look like it was floating.
4.0,"Was worried about other review, but ours was great. A medium fit my 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 110# daughter perfectly (roomy/comfy fit)."
4.0,"The fit was exactly what i wanted. Tighten enough but comfortable being a bigger girl. I didnt try it on with spanx yet but the way its cut... i might not even. Im 200lbs and bought an xl for a wedding in septemeber. I am returning it though because the orange is very... bold. Too halloween-y definitely getting the same dress in a different print/color.<br /><br />It also seemed that there was a snag- almost as if someone wore it before from where it was placed... like a finger nail pulled it pulling a bra up... so that makes me weary..<br /><br />But, solid fit, avoid this print though."
4.0,No drawstring in waist
4.0,"My fianc√©, and I purchased this ring for his casual wedding ring. It is a good quality piece, and you can‚Äôt beat the price. But we ordered it in red and it came in green, because we were impatient we decided to just keep the ring in green. It isn‚Äôt a big deal if you are easy going about the color, if you aren‚Äôt I would be prepared to do an exchange if it doesn‚Äôt come in the right color."
4.0,"I bought this wonderful, stylish Sonic t-shirt for my child, and he really likes it. He wears it often and looks great in it with its bright and fashionable design.<br /><br />However, I have one comment regarding the material the t-shirt is made of. It is made of synthetic materials, which can cause discomfort in hot weather. My child complains that he gets hot and sweaty wearing it during the day.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I still think this is a good purchase considering its stylish design and low price. If your child is not opposed to synthetic materials and you live in cooler conditions, this could be an excellent choice for you. However, if you live in a hot climate, you may be better off choosing a t-shirt made of natural materials to provide your child with comfort while wearing it."
4.0,Love the look I wish the clockwork was better
4.0,"I like it.  It's solid, looks expensive and has a professional look to it.  It's cheap and would recommend this item to anyone"
4.0,This cute top is both soft and flattering. True to size it is quite comfortable. I like the tunic length. It pairs well with jeans and looks cute with leggings. The leopard pattern is fun. Could have lived without the twist knot but overall a terrific top.
4.0,"Love the simplicity of this hoody, the design and all, but the material of the hoodie feels a little cheap. Which is fine for the price of it. No regrets!"
4.0,did not ship the right size. A little big. Still happy with the value.
4.0,its bigger then i thought! the color is more like yellow too. overall i like this product!!!! 4 stars<br /><br />word
4.0,"Used it when we had snow, didn't get cold sliding in the snow, but the zipper jumped the track a bit, but was able to fix it"
4.0,"This is a very interesting product. I bought it expecting it to be a small wallet where you slide your cards in and out. My husband has one of those style wallets and he really enjoys it, so I thought I would get him this one to try. It's definitely not what I expected.<br /><br />Instead of it being an actual &quot;wallet&quot;, it is 2 credit card sized pieces of carbon fiber held together by a large thick rubber band. The carbon fiber is super durable and very lightweight, so I have a feeling this will do a wonderful job of protecting my cards.<br /><br />The rubber band is very stiff and has almost no stretch to it. This is a good thing, because it keeps everything held nice and tight inside the wallet. I haven't had anything fall out yet, but I will update if that happens.<br /><br />Since the rubber band is so thick, I usually have to take it completely apart to get my cards out, which is definitely annoying. I'm sure that after some use and breaking in, this won't be necessary anymore. It is just a minor annoyance right now since the wallet is still new.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The opinions listed here are my own, and the discount I received had no bearing on my review of this product."
4.0,Perfect for what my son needed.  Slightly larger than expected. Great price.
4.0,They are so cute ! We received lots of compliments when we were them to church. I love them !
4.0,"great variety, children love the design and options. colorful, playful kids socks. only bad thing is the treads inside the socks are too loose."
4.0,"This 2-piece set by Hefunige is super nice and comfortable. It is purplish grey. The top is a tank, and the shorts have an elastic waistband. The fabric, a viscose and spandex blend, is super cool and breathable. It fits true to size, but I‚Äôd recommend ordering up if you don‚Äôt like stuff to be fitted."
4.0,Part of the chain was broken when I received it but it was no problem to fix.
4.0,"After searching and trying on many dresses, I ordered this one. Being 5'2"" with a soft middle and arms, it has been difficult to find a dress that was flattering to a figure that is not a size 6. This dress has a thicker material that holds a better and more flattering shape (hiding the slight muffin top areas). It isn't tight around my arms and the material seems comfortable enough. I haven't worn it out yet, but will add to my review if it doesn't hold up well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seemed to be a little less fancy than I expected from the ad."
4.0,"Had to return because of size, but the fabric and color was great. In a smaller size, I would have loved it."
4.0,They are very pretty and small. Be careful handling them because they get lost easily. And be careful when touching your nose because it comes out easily. Lucky it can with a lot of them.
4.0,Nice dress would have given a 5 if the brooch Clip didn‚Äôt break upon arrival.
4.0,"I had ordered a shirt like this before, the same size, and I was expecting it to be the same because my older one is a bit looser. It is a bit tight, but it still fits me. And I can't complain too much because I love Stitch!!"
4.0,Too large I sent it back.
4.0,Good pair of shorts
4.0,"Qued√≥ perfecto, excelente repuesto"
4.0,"This little necklace was great with my Halloween costume. The chain is sturdy and the little blood bag is made of a thick but squishy plastic so no worry of leaks. It hung to cleavage level. My only complaint is I wish the bag was a little bigger to have a better effect. Other than that, its very cute."
4.0,"Much bigger than I thought but the quality is good, fun to wear."
4.0,"Had to take the inserts out because they hurt my feet and my foot sat too high.  Once inserts were out, they fit and feel great"
4.0,"Nice quality, but heavy."
4.0,"tiny chip on edge of necklace.  still, i love this set.  i have worn the earrings several times and gotten complimented every time i wear them.  the pendant is a bit large and i thought i would never wear it, but actually, i think i can pull it off, lol.  minus the earrings.  if you wear that huge necklace and the earrings together, imho, it looks kinda garish.  but the earrings alone or the pendant alone, works."
4.0,Lightweight and good price. Has just the right amount of dazzle.
4.0,"This set is great.  I was initially turned off by the recommendation on the tag that they not go in the dryer, but another reviewer here tried it and found it only shrunk the length a little.  I tried this with my least favorite color and found the same.  They are quite long right out of the package, and they shrink 1-2 inches, but still long enough that I am not worried it will ride up and show my belly.  I then washed them all and everything is good.  Subsequent washings did not shrink them further."
4.0,Theses are a Novilty Item and look very nice when worn. JC
4.0,"The shirt fit as I hoped it would - I usually wear a medium, I'm 5'3"" and weigh 140 lbs. I bought a large because I wanted it to be roomy and it is. It's soft, but not thin; the color is definitely purple, but a heathered purple, not solid. The sleeves are tacked so they stay rolled up. It would be easy to remove the tack if you didn't want them rolled. The graphic is a bit thick so it's slightly stiff, and up close it appears bold but you can see it clearly at a distance - and if you want to get a laugh from others, you need that! Overall, I think this shirt will stand up to many washings, get softer over time, and be a favorite when I go running."
4.0,"Works as state, helps with swelling"
4.0,They're thin but comfortable do run about 2 sizes too small
4.0,Super comfy and good fit!
4.0,"I don't hate these, but I don't love them either. They look great, but they aren't as comfortable as my crocs are. I wore them for a while hoping they just needed to be broken in but I just can't seem to get there with these. The only thing this has over my crocs is that they store smaller and are easier to pack. But they just don't measure up to the comfort and ease of putting on and taking off like I get form my crocs. I see this being used sometimes, but certainly not my go-to sandals."
4.0,"Mostly what I expected, fogs up glasses though."
4.0,A lil thin
4.0,Fits good and pretty on!!
4.0,"I have had this purse for about a year and a half now, and it has held up pretty well. It has a nice small zipper pocket on the side for me to put in my small mirror and such. It is really nice, except it gets unclipped  a lot and falls to the ground. It also just opens up randomly while I'm walking, so someone could easily steal my wallet. I have to pay really close attention to that. But it is very true to the picture, color and all. The strap is easily adjusted and its nice and long. One more complaint: The sealing is TOTALLY peeling off. Like, a lot. so overall, not a super heavy-duty purse, but good if you're just a preteen like me. It's a great purse though. Has held up pretty well."
4.0,Should have purchased ones with toes out because foot slides white doing exercise. Six pairs- great price and great value.
4.0,"Ordered for my twins (3yrs), they love them. Super cute. Only issue was on one, part of the zipper on one side was missing, so had to get another."
4.0,nice belt and seems to be a good quality one.
4.0,I love the comfiness but hate the tight wrist band.  I cut the whole wristband off and rolled the sleeve !  Now it‚Äôs perfect !!!
4.0,"Soft, comfortable but it appears to be cotton T-shirt in picture but it‚Äôs more of a silky material"
4.0,Love the red one super cute soft non scratchy.material for baby... White one had red spots leaked through the logo... Super sucks..
4.0,my wife  still loved the flowered type. she  had one that only had 1 snap and the other 3 had to pound to get them to close. but i love the style and for the price i guess its ok. just wish they would tell you.
4.0,Pretty dress but I dont like the material honestly... its that stretchy thin silky material. It is really nice otherwise
4.0,"They look beautiful with pants or dress, I didn't give it 5 stars because they seem to stretch a little and feel lose but still a great buy"
4.0,"I guess I thought I was ordering Asian sizes? But the size chart says that Large should fit 38 shoulders and my 38 suit jackets fit perfectly so I don't know why this thing is a tent on me. It would be an okay vest if it fit, not the best quality but you get what you pay for I suppose.<br /><br />Update: I received a message from the seller asking if I wanted a LARGER size, thinking I misunderstood Asian sizing, when I actually got an American Large when I tried to order and Asian Large. I responded asking for a smaller vest.<br /><br />Update: I received the proper size and it is now the vest I expected. I appreciate the seller's prompt effort to correct the situation."
4.0,"I like this top a lot. The sleeves are a little cumbersome, though."
4.0,"GREAT PRODUCT ,FITS WELL AND NOW I JUST BUY DIFFERENT TOPS  FOR SWIMMING _i weigh 145 and the large was the right size"
4.0,This was a gift given to my girlfriend. It appears to well made.
4.0,Super cute but was a bit big. Still worth the price.
4.0,Perfect for children birthday parties
4.0,"I have used this jewelry cleaner for years, first bought it at an art fair years ago."
4.0,"Cute keychain charm. Like the tassel, wish the beads were real stone beads instead of glass."
4.0,Love the movie so I wanted the tshirt . It‚Äôs runs big so a little big but I didn‚Äôt have time to return it . Overall very cool shirt . Nice colors !
4.0,"It just a little larger than the passport so its perfect; not too large or too thick.  It fits my passport and credit cards perfectly.  It has a very soft feel to it, which I like, but I'm not sure if it's genuine leather but I'm not a leather expert.  Time and use will tell."
4.0,I read lots of reviews that said to size up and was disappointed. I would say stick w your true size because this dress is VERY stretchy. The material does feel a bit cheap but it worked great for a work Halloween trunk or treat.
4.0,"Great, heavy-duty, thick crystal, easy time/calendar adjustments, bulky... just awesome!  Little maintenance, basic dial, just what you would expect! The only thing I would modify on this watch is the night light. It could have been brighter or ""indiglo like"", but other than that, I am satisfied with the purchase. If you are looking for a maintenance free and no-frills watch, this is a good choice!"
4.0,These are good quality mittens that allow little ones to grab things however I bought the 1-2 years and my daughter is between both ages and they alerted too big. They're still good though.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter she loves the look of it; i think it is sized down (smaller) than the size listed on tag
4.0,given as a gift..took awhile in delivery but ok product
4.0,Jane Eyre is my favourite book.  I was thrilled to find this and wear it often. It arrived on time and in good condition.
4.0,"Nice pendant, my only wish is that it would have been a bigger size in diameter.  Still beautiful."
4.0,"great light just what I needed.. Like the three settings on the light, magnet is great holds well.May get another one."
4.0,The first one I bought is way too small. So I ordered a second in a really larger size and it arrived today. It is fine.  I realized too late that oriental women are smaller than Americans.
4.0,It fit perfectly I wore it for a great gatsby party and everyone loved it!
4.0,"The lens have fallen out 3 times. Other than that, I have liked them but probably would not buy another pair."
4.0,"Very cute and feminine.<br /><br />Giftable 'cause it came very well packaged.<br /><br />Looks very well made, and the material looks smooth and with a nice shine.<br /><br />Good quality piece of jewelry."
4.0,"The shirt was exactly like the picture. The elastic in the sleeves are a little too tight, but other than that, I love it."
4.0,Bought these for my grandson and they look like a good pair of boots.
4.0,Beautiful color. Bought for a beach wedding . I‚Äôm 31 weeks pregnant so my belly is big and it lifts the lining right above my lady bits so it‚Äôs basically useless as a slip (for me) may be really short for curvy or tall ladies. The arm bands are a small piece of fabric so I‚Äôm afraid they may rip after a long day. Overall its very comfortable and a gorgeous blue. Very wrinkled when it arrived. Arrived in a day with Prime.
4.0,nice looking watch looks real but you definitely need big wrists if you are going to wear this one
4.0,"Fast shipping.  Bought large; great compression, keeping my feet warm, comfortable.  However, they're not easy to get off.  Wish they came in x-large.  I am a woman with size 8.5 foot."
4.0,Great cufflinks! They seem to be well made.
4.0,"I wear these to the casino for good luck, though they haven't worked for that yet. They are cute, and a good conversation piece. The ball on one of the links does get stuck behind the glass at a certain point but other than that they are great, and very reasonably priced."
4.0,This just what I was looking for. It for my daughter wedding and it got me perfect.
4.0,The price is right. The shoe is wide and comfortable.
4.0,These boots were used for placing concrete. They worked out good. No rips and at the end of the job just hosed them off. I do not know how they would hold up over time but they seem well made.<br />They seem to fit close to listed size. They didn't slip around walking in the wet concrete. Overall good boots.
4.0,Had to return the first time to get a smaller size. Definitely runs big
4.0,"Very pretty, 99.99% accuracy as shone in the description. A tad large for anyone I know to assume *I* could afford this if it were genuine, but as costume jewelry it's lovely. Bright pops of bling as it reflects light, fit is accurate, feels comfortable on your finger, the weight seems good for the size, not cheap or too heavy. My only critique is the edge cuts on the green stone are a bit moulded rather than sharp as you would see with a genuine stone, but hey- this ring is essentially the price of shipping SO WHO CARES? This is a GREAT value for the pop of colour!"
4.0,"The waist on the dress is much closer to the size of the bust.  If you're not curvy, this will fit fine.  I expected the fabric to be less stiff... Perhaps if it went through a wash it would hang a little better.  I ended up returning it because it's not good for my shape."
4.0,these rings are sturdy and seem to be good quality. i love the coloring. Too bad i cant wear them cuz they aren't the right size but that's no ones fault but my own =/
4.0,I love them comfortable stays up n look great sadly I wear them at work n they rip so easy
4.0,Roomy and fits everything I need. so far no problems
4.0,Gift for my daughter. Was very pretty
4.0,"I'm usually a medium and they are little more snug than I'd like, but super comfy and don't put any tension on my belly! Just recommend sizing up."
4.0,size S works perfectly for my daughter.<br /><br />I usually buy 10-12 for my 9.5 years old daughter. Size xs is perfect for her! Which I'm glad because those kind of pants don't really exist for her age.<br /><br />The purple color turned out to be more on the pink-fushia color though. We kept in anyway.<br /><br />Update:<br />DO NOT TUMBLE DRY: the fabric got all old looking (pilling everywhere). I have to buy another one because my daughter loves them so much!
4.0,Socks are fine for the price. They are warm which is why I bought them.
4.0,"They're okay. I was looking for all cotton boxers to sleep and lounge in. These are not 100% cotton as advertised. They are 88% cotton, 12% polyester. Soft material but not what I'm looking for. Definitely size up as other reviewers suggest. I have a 34"" waist and the M were a perfect relaxed fit."
4.0,"Not too big size, right at the one showed in item pic. Color is very nature."
4.0,Great cooling shirts for hot weather
4.0,"I ordered the dark wash vest in a large.  I'm about a size 8-10 and it buttons perfectly and the measurements are pretty much in accordance with the posted size chart.  (It's in the picture section.)  The wash is a nice dark blue with no significant fading or distressing of the fabric.  I'm not sure I really consider it &#34;cropped&#34; as it comes below my waist and I am 5'10 with a long torso, but it is good quality and I like it."
4.0,"Good one, fit good but smell"
4.0,"Lighter weight than I expected, but I still love it over a blouse or spring/summer dress."
4.0,"I like the scarf better than the hat. The hat seems a little too tall especially, when you add the pom pom. It just sort of caves in but not in a sexy way. It's pretty cold, and dry here so it definitely gives my hair the static. So, unless I plan on wearing the hat all day, I usually just skip it. I like the scary well enough. It's  a little wide but also a little short and bulky to wrap around your neck. I sort of just spread it out over my shoulders and left it hang. It keeps be pretty warm. Especially, in my cold office.<br /><br />I love the purple color. It's really pretty. I have a thing for scarves. I just love them."
4.0,I sized up as the reviewers suggested and the XL fit my size 8 frame. It is attractive but the downside is you may find the material hot.
4.0,Fits as expected. Fits how it‚Äôs supposed to. Exactly how it‚Äôs described .
4.0,The Same great Fruit of the Loom product and great price on these I will be ordering more.
4.0,Cute little earrings. Came with cheap backings though.
4.0,"Working at a car dealership piercings weren't allowed so I bought these instead of putting holes in my ears, very nice looking strong magnet. I ended up buying a spare pair because I lost the back to one of the,. But very nice for magnetic earrings."
4.0,"This is my first time buying clothes from Amazon. I needed a dress for a couple of fall weddings and this is perfect. I'm also still nursing my child and the neckline makes it easy without stretching it out. It's a little long and a little big (I usually wear 14/16 and am 5'4), but I've got some wedges that will help."
4.0,"Not sure how to rate it. They seem bulky, hard and wide, but our kid loves them."
4.0,"A few loose and fraying threads, but overall a cute cardigan. Seems like good quality."
4.0,It's great wonderful but I give 4 because I didn't wear that yet but it's look so good I am happy that I spend on something nice
4.0,No me gusto que solo hay talla para ni√±os
4.0,Super cute and very flattering.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weigh 145.  I ordered small and it fits great.  I‚Äôve received lots of compliments.
4.0,"As far as compressions go, the material felt great and the potential was there... it was just too small. I bought an XL, but I couldn't even put it on. I'm 5'2, 140lbs. Waist 29&#34;, Hips 39&#34;. Perhaps I'm just a little too heavy for this product in particular, which is fine. The seller's return policy is great though, so I'm happy I gave it a shot!"
4.0,I like it a lot....will probably order another color!
4.0,My kid likes it but I put only four starts because I didn‚Äôt like it was synthetic material.
4.0,My baby is 9Months I bought the size 12Months. It fits him at the exact measurements meaning he can only where for maybe until 10Months only. Usually if baby is 9M and you buy size 12M there is space for him to grow with it until at least 11M but it is not the case for this.
4.0,Wished there was a front view it is blank on the front
4.0,I have purchased these for my buddy here is a big Florida State fan put a couple on this windshield on his truck and on a fish tank only reason I didn't give it a 5-star as because they're a little hard to peel off I accidentally ended up ripping one slightly because of it
4.0,its grate everything it says it is no complaints
4.0,"Deducting one star for the humming/buzzing sound it produces when the lights are on. It's not the biggest deal, but kind of a bummer. Multiple light settings and I got several compliments on it."
4.0,"Its costume quality material, but it's still soft and stretchy. Not really made for plus size woman, especially if you have large assets. It's in &#34;made in china&#34; sizes so you'll need to buy 2 sizes up from your usually size."
4.0,"Considering, the current state of things with COVID we will likely be wearing face covers for the foreseeable future - even with the distribution of the vaccine. My Mother-In-Law, is a smallish woman, finding her masks that fit (not considering child-size) has been frustrating. . These work perfectly...and are fairly breathable. These are perfect for running errands or going outside in places while it is still mandated she wear a mask.<br /><br />Bonus: She loves anything/everything with cat prints..."
4.0,Christmas gift for a two year old
4.0,"This scarf is beautiful. I got the black and it is true to color. It is soft and comfortable. I will be using it as a shawl for an upcoming event. Nice enough to pair with a cocktail dress as a shawl or just use with a coat. I am curious to see whether it will attract and hold lint, but I would recommend it."
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but it's great quality for the price paid, and super cute! My only complaint is the fabric is a bit itchy around the seen where the hood is attached....but I just wear a scarf with it to help :)"
4.0,"I usually wear 10 formal dresses, but the size is smaller than 10, I was not able to zip it up.  I weigh 147 lbs, 5&#34;1' 36 A. My boyfriend said if I removed a few ribs then he could zip it up.  The material seem rough, itchy, uncomfortable to me.  I bought it based on good reviews in this dress.  The price is a great deal.  The picture looked beautiful.  The dusty pink looked like cotton candy pink to me.  I was disappointed because I bought it for my niece wedding. I showed everyone and everyone said the dress looks beautiful.  The dress reminds me of a dress you would put on a porcelain doll.  The free return was easy n they credit me the full price I paid for that is why I gave 4 stars. Don't let my review discourage you, it never hurts to try it on and take advantage of the return.üòä"
4.0,"I have the size M and immediately knew they would be too short. I even double-checked because I thought maybe they were supposed to be Capri style. Next, I measured and their size chart is accurate, but it measures from the top of the waist, so you must take that into consideration when choosing your size.<br /><br />I am 122 pounds and 5'9"" and have the Size M. I have several inches of bare skin around my ankle-calf area, nothing like the (current) model that shows bunching at her ankle. They did stretch a bit when I put them on, and I hoped they would reach my ankle, but they don't. I can't go up a size because they would be baggy. I recommend this for shorter women.<br /><br />Seam: I also noticed is the seam is slightly lighter color than the fabric. It is an olive green, but it jumps out a bit because of the pattern, especially where it hits black fabric. This makes it decorative, but for my preference, I felt like it accented and drew attention to my rear end, especially since the seam goes right down the middle part. It looks like they tried to match a shade in the pattern, but I would've preferred a solid black stitching.<br /><br />The pattern is beautiful. It's like a military green-black design, sort of on the camouflage side and I find that very flattering and a nice distraction from so many solid black leggings on the market. Note that the fabric is pretty thin which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your needs. Even if I had the proper length, these would be a spring-summer legging for me. They will not provide much warmth in colder weather. Now, if you do hot-yoga, these could be exactly what you need. Overall, it's a good product, sewn well, just check your sizing and you should be happy with it."
4.0,I bought as a gift and she loved it! But it looks like it‚Äôs missing the words on the bottom which made it funny because she hates when people hug her!
4.0,Very attractive dress.  Flattering and comfortable.
4.0,"I feel like a rockstar in these! They fit great, feel great and are so cute. Just wish the lenses were as black as my heart and blocked UV rays, but they are still pretty dark. Love them!"
4.0,Lovely pattern. Soft and silky but slippery. Having trouble getting it to stay on my head. Keeps sliding off.
4.0,"I like these shorts and how comfortable they are. They have the right amount of stretch, and I love that they have two pockets and a liner, so that I don't have to wear underwear with them. The only thing I don't like is the shorts bunch up in the front too much for my liking, which makes the pockets poof out to the sides."
4.0,"The shirt was fine, however I normally wear a 14/16 but a size 20 fit. Runs very small."
4.0,"I loved it. And I still do, I just wish i would have seen washing instructions (are there any, anywhere?) Because this badboy SHRUNK.  It's still wearable, and Ill probably by another if i can't stretch it back out."
4.0,"Flattering fit, perfect for the beach.  I normally wear a size 12, I carry most of my weight in my midsection so the bottoms were a bit snug and the top was a bit loose but neither prevented me from wearing the suit.  The breast pads are a formed without much give so when they drifted off to the side or up too high, the chest looked funny.  This was more of a nuisance than a flaw.  The pads are removable but I like the extra coverage."
4.0,Reasonable cost. This staple of men's fashion has been a hit all year long. The accompanied box is a nice gesture and to ensure your lapels receive no damage.
4.0,It's a little big for my daughter
4.0,So I bought my normal size and it fit as expected.<br />The material is not super soft but it's not too scratchy either. I thought it was tolerable. It's nice and flowy and has some stretch to it.<br />Overall 4 stars and I will be wearing this a lot.<br />Only cons are<br />yes it could be softer<br />I wish there was a little tighter fit at the bust to show more of my body shape<br /><br />But it's a great top and I'll be wearing it all summer!!
4.0,The quality is good but the quantity could be better.
4.0,"1-ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èposting pictures of me in a swim suit, not my thing! I'm actually dreading this.<br />2- don't normally wear 2 pieces that show my midsection, but I said the heck with it, I'll be somewhere no one knows me.<br />3-I first ordered the XL and it didn't hold my girls up very well and almost came up to high over my stomach. And the shoulder part was too big, so I returned for a size down, Large. Fit much better and a little tighter. Still a little too loose on my shoulders though. But all in all I really did like the suit. And the material was exactly that of a good swim suit. Worth the price. Fast shipping and easy return."
4.0,"Tried to soak in Alcohol before wearing to insure cleanliness/avoid infections, and the bright pretty red instantly started  fading in Alcohol. Ring is also very light weight ."
4.0,these are good for the price
4.0,"Comfortable, nice-looking, and apparently well-constructed. They work well even though the fingers are slightly too long for me. I bought them so I could use a touchscreen device while doing inventory work in a freezer. They're hit-or-miss in such cold conditions (approximately zero degrees Fahrenheit/-18 degrees Celsius), but it's better than nothing. In normal cold, they're just about perfect."
4.0,"Very light than look., fits good real loose ,really don""t like zipper think I may have some problem later , overall  good"
4.0,"SO CUTE!! Great for the price. I read all reviews before buying and some people had a a bad experience. Not me. The dress fits, I did order a size up! aim 5'4 and the dress is great! Be warned it falls between upper and mid thigh, so it's short but adorable.<br />The sleeves were undone at the ends but not really a big deal, no one will notice. Also, after I wore it, the lace ripped under both armpits and the zipper became undone from the dress, exposing a hole at the end of the zipper line.<br />I still like it, but read the reviews first"
4.0,This pendant is very nice and should last a long time. The chain is dainty with no noticeable flaws. I feel it should be a little stronger though but is a great starter chain. Recommended for a beginner!
4.0,"Works good, fit good too."
4.0,Very warm hat at a good price. Keeps me warm in this cold Chicago weather. 4 stars only because the description says Made In US but the product itself says Made in China. I honestly don't care where it's made as long as it's warm but not advertised correctly.
4.0,"So I gave this dress 4 stars only because the stitching could use some work. Where the tie is, there's visible threads just hanging there, and they aren't even black...they're blue and red. It's blatantly obvious there's a problem there so I just crossed the ties before tying a bow. There are also loose threads in the arm opening and the pockets. Oh, by the way, hooray pockets! Anyway, I tried trimming the visible threads but it's hard to do since it's not the end pieces that are showing, it's the entire loops of where it was sewn. Other than that, it's a very cute dress and fits perfectly. I'm 5'8, 175lbs and a Large fit perfect. Be aware that where the top and bottom meet does not align with the waist. Mine lands almost 2 inches above it which sort of throws off the A-line look but it's nothing that will prevent me from buying another one."
4.0,"I'm having trouble finding authentication of them being sterling silver. The pieces are all placed in a small plastic bag. No card or papers.<br />The earring end that inserts in ear is rather large.<br />However, the set is very pretty and cost was great."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas so she has not worn, but it looks as advertised. The graphics are more of an iron on feel."
4.0,"It's cute. But the quality you would expect for the price. The materials feel like they aren't going to be very durable, about the same quality you would find at Wal-Mart."
4.0,Cute small bag for when you just need to grab your phone and a few small things. The phone in the picture is for size. It holds just the smallest things but the leather is well made and zippers are nice.<br />Overall this bag works for what it is made for a cell phone.
4.0,it fit well and I hope to wear it sometime
4.0,Nice quality and pretty comfortable.
4.0,"like the look of the purse, in fact purchased the black one and the brown on, it large enought but not too, too, large. it has enought room in it to put all my essentials. It appears to be sturdy enougt, like the strap, long enough to carry over the shoulder or short enough to carry by hand, it feels wonderful."
4.0,"These are great glasses, but are smaller than they appear to be on the model."
4.0,not as orange as I hoped
4.0,"Perfect for an athletic build, but a little thin in material Colosseum makes a good product."
4.0,Had to return and order 1 size up
4.0,"I'm 5'9 and I'd prefer if this was a bit longer, but it works! Keeps my boobs in place as it's tight enough and straps are adjustable. Slightly cheeky cut in the booty - smaller than what I'm used to but nothing obscene. Super cute!"
4.0,"These socks are vibrant in color and comfortable (for the most part).  I have larger feet (size 11) and these were comfortable for most of the day.  They gave my feet support in all the right areas.  These socks are better suited for work outs or excersize routines. When I wore them on my walk they were great but when I wore them all day, they started digging into my ankles leaving a red ridge that is still there 2 day later."
4.0,Very cool pattern.  My 9 year old son LOVES them!
4.0,Would have been nice if it came with replacement pins. But an exact replacement otherwise. Quick shipping too.
4.0,"great Product, Less packaging"
4.0,"Es inc√≥modo pero esta incre√≠ble, si me gust√≥"
4.0,I had to actually return this dress but it was really pretty. My reasons from returning it were the waist area landed really high above my waist and the top of the dress is see through lace.
4.0,"Nice glasses, they reminded me of the 70's! Probably made a little better than back then."
4.0,I would of given this adorable hat 5 stars if the white thread used as beaver teeth was actually visible. The threading is almost not even noticeable. It makes the hat look more like a bear. It's still cute and really soft so I am going to keep it.
4.0,When I wear them they work well
4.0,Is very cute but it runs a little big on me. I'm 5 feet tall and 100 lbs.
4.0,"Super cute body chain. It arrived carefully packaged and wasn't tangled or anything. Easy to put on and wear. Unfortunately I found it a little short, so I'm looking for a plain extender chain. Probably fine for smaller busted women, but at 32E-F, it tends to pull down on my neck. I'm still wearing it because it is so sweet looking though!"
4.0,Pretty nice. Very inexpensive. Pants stay up
4.0,Very cute & comfortable protective work cap.
4.0,"A great party favor, I used it for my french themed birthday party. A cute little &#34;souvenir&#34; from France, although it is tricky to get on you backpack or whatever you want to put it on."
4.0,Would have liked more sturdy material but it‚Äôs good looking
4.0,"I like the new clasp as it is easier to open than the previous generation. It is solidly built, don't know if it is water proof, but it has been dropped in the snow-slush and no liquid got in.  Inside it will hold a good number of cards/ID/etc.  Under the cash band is a small rubber piece that holds the cash in place and stretches to accommodate a good wad of cash.<br /><br />There two things that made me take away 1 star. It is slightly bigger than the previous version, and the inside dividers are still the same plastic as the old style which eventually will break.<br /><br />This is a great product for ladies who want something smaller than their purse to carry ID and cards in, and organized, which can be put in a purse.  I carry mine in my front pocket and sometimes it is a little bulky, however, most of the time I do not even think about it.<br /><br />I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation."
4.0,I got the cream color and it‚Äôs basically bright white. Should have thought of this but the leggings are not flattering in my opinion otherwise the top is cute def have to wear a bra though
4.0,"The sleeves are TIGHT, but I guess that makes it look less sloppy. I wish it were a bit longer, it hit me right at the top of my waistband I'm the back, I would have preferred it to cover my backside, but all in all, this is a great light garment, it's a lightweight jersey knit. I got this in the middle of July, in the Midwest, and wore it out to dinner that evening-granted, it was unseasonably cold that day, so I had a good reason. This will be my go to piece in early fall"
4.0,Good soft quality material. It is not sheer. Kept back 1 star because it doesn't go up far enough for me. It is a smaller medium than regular medium fit for me.
4.0,I returned this dress because it ran small and had less material than what I was expecting.
4.0,I thought the dress would be longer returning
4.0,This product for $10 is really awesome. I usually buy L or XL. But its wrongly mentioned as XXXL which is actually an XL (US) size. Light weight and surely not for peak winter
4.0,"The quality seems great for these clogs, but my 7 year old  is wearing a size 1 shoe, and these are atleast 2 sizes too small. I ordered a size 1 thinking clogs typically run big. Going to return and reorder a size 3. Hope they fit so ce they're cute."
4.0,Great product received it ahead of shipping time expect. I love my new watch! Thanks
4.0,Just what I expected: fun & a great reaction from every1.
4.0,Beautiful for the price.  Especially lightning deal.  The necklace chain did break quickly as do these types of chains.
4.0,Pretty cool...A few people have asked what the symbols are and I am delighted to tell them.
4.0,"It is rather heavy and bulky, (you only get one not a pair) as you can see when i tilt my head it goes directly to one side. My other glass plugs arent quite this heavy so keep in mind this is not lightweight.  I dont mind the extra weight seeing as how some helps with stretching and thats what i got it for. It is true to size which was really my main concern"
4.0,"The birds are super cute. I wish they had more stiles with this print. The dress is pretty short; I certainly can't wear it as a dress to the office (as a tunic, maybe). But it looks to hit about the same place on the model. Fabric is knit and, like many knits, it's kind of hot. Check the size chart for an accurate picture of what sizes run."
4.0,Had to take the cups out to make this work as I am a D cup but managed to make it happen.  The design was so cute I couldn't resist ! Great under button up tops and tanks! Love it! So on trend right now! Wish they offered other colors
4.0,fdhjkdk
4.0,"Ok 1st off I LOVED these shorts so much that I purchased 2 more pair a week or 2 later AND will likely by 2 more! What I liked most was the ""weight"" of the material. I reminded me of old school Levi jeans, you know the heavy unwashed canvass type!?!? Yep that's what they feel like! Shoot like ""Old School"" I had to at least was them once! HA. I even recommended this product to several of my friends. OK here is the ""only"" reason I give it 4 instead of a perfect 5 star rating! The zipper on the 1st pair was stiff, but I liked them so much I was going to ""live with them"". Well I was on a short vacation and the zipper just broke! Funny enough is I don't even recall putting a force hard enough on the zipper to make it fail , in fact I went to put them on and went fore the zipper and it was broken. The bummer is I didn't even have them for 3.5 months and probably only wore them 5-7 times. I have an email to the supplier and I am hoping to change this to a 5 star review upon receipt of a replacement pair. We shall see....other than that just check the zipper for perfect function! If you want a heavy duty well fitting pair of shorts I don't think you will be disappointed."
4.0,Very cute... fits nice... only downside (which I didn't even think about) bra straps aren't easy to hide unless you go strapless... Thinking about getting in every color.
4.0,"Works great, even for my big watches just have to adjust a little for the 50mm."
4.0,"Looks good, feels comfortable, pretty fabric- this is a nice colorful summer dress for the price!"
4.0,My boyfriend loves it! Just hope that it washes well and keeps its shape and lace stays white.
4.0,Love it but wish it stayed buttoned a little better.
4.0,I love the dress... it's so great for summer as the material is thin. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it's a little shorter than I would have liked. I'm 5&#34;8 and thin but have a 36D cup size. I purchased a large because I thought an XL would be way too loose. Even though the dress is supposed to be loose.. I didn't want it to look like I bought a size too big. I guess just because I'm tall and have boobs.. it made the dress length a little shorter. I love this dress so much I'm going to buy another one but I'm short sleeves and a size bigger :)) The dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. I agree with other reviews as the lighter colors may be transparent. Mine is black and it's fine.
4.0,"What's not to like great timepiece,  and you can't beat the price."
4.0,I love this watch! It‚Äôs really nice and sturdy! However it didn‚Äôt come in a box and it‚Äôs a gift so I didn‚Äôt love that. But I love watch itself!
4.0,Got an XL per the measurement recommendations and ended up needing to size down. I‚Äôm usually a large so trust your gut. Fabric is really stretchy.
4.0,Looks beautiful on. Flows nicely and covers up any undesirable areas. The color is a beautiful neutral color that goes with just about anything. The material is thinner than expected and a bit scratchy. You will definitely want to wear a tank or shirt under it as it is very see through.
4.0,"These are very pretty, and the price is great. They are quite thin and soft, so they aren't very well suited for everyday use, but areeye-catching enough to set of the right outfit."
4.0,"I really enjoy these ""Le Danzing"" sunglasses from Le Specs. the shape of the lenses is subtly different than anything else I currently see for sale. They aren't super round like the tiny trendy glasses, nor are they reflective of the massive lenses from the early 2010s. instead, they are large enough to provide actual sun protection, while having a subtly unique curved out shape.the glasses are described as black and gold, but I honestly had to do a double-take in multiple kinds of lighting because the tone of the gold is so soft it could be mistaken for gold or silver depending on what you wear with it. I like this because it adds even more versatility.<br /><br />My one gripe is that for the price, these glasses could be packaged in a much more appealing way. The first pair of Le specs I owned were delivered in a beautiful hard case that was black on the outside and red on the inside. it felt truly luxurious and would have been wonderful to gift. This pair came in a blue soft case that you squeeze to open. While this might not deter some people, I found it disappointing. If you're going to spend $100 on a non prescription pair of sunglasses, you expect perhaps mid level luxury. I think the brand could take itself much further by stepping up the packaging to consistently send out the lovely hard cases. That would take these glasses from very good to great."
4.0,"Great dress! Definitely on the short size if you‚Äôre tall, and don‚Äôt even think about raising your arms. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and about 155 with an athletic build and I got the XL."
4.0,I love the way these earrings look and made
4.0,"I love this chain.  It's very pretty and looks expensive.  I bought two different lengths and am glad I did.  My only problem is that I struggle with the dainty fastening hardware.  I was bringing the necklace to work and asking for help putting it on until I added a short extender with a larger clasp and now I'm happy.  If you have a hubby or child who can help, then it would be a 5-star product!  Gem Avenue, the vendor, is great...."
4.0,It was a gift. Have not gotten any complains.
4.0,Been looking for short sleeve hoodies at reasonable prices.  So far so good.<br />One issue is the heavy cord that actually came out when washed.<br />Very cool shirt.
4.0,It's so pretty! Takes a bit to get used to comfort-wise.
4.0,"I love the deep, plush, cowl neckline as I get cold easily on winter nights. Because of that, I wish the pajama bottoms were also made from the same plush fabric."
4.0,"I keep a lot of stuff in my wallet and originally had a tri-fold wallet which was falling apart. This wallet was able to hold everything I had in the previous wallet. While it is slimmer than my previous tri-fold wallet it is somewhat larger. It does have a lot of pockets if you have a lot of cards or other things to store. I think it would be slimmer if I had less items in my wallet, but I would not say that this wallet is designed to be slim. It does fit nicely in my front pocket. The wallet looks nice and is made of a nice leather which it soft and somewhat bendable but not overly bendable and keeps its shape well. After putting everything in the wallet I don't see anywhere where the leather of the wallet or the seems are stretching at all, so it seems to be solidly made. There is a slot for and SD card and a sim card. I did not try to the sim card slot but the SD card is a little small and hard to put in, I would be a little concerned that it might be damaged in there, so use it at your own peril. One nice feature is that there are 2 ID pockets, I use one for an ID and the other for a picture. I do believe that it is a good functional wallet and I would recommend for people who need a lot of storage in their wallet.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Good dial
4.0,Cute. Simple.
4.0,The only thing I don't like is the dress is shorter than expected.
4.0,I like it! for the price I think it was perfect.  I jazzed it up with some jewelry and it was super comfy!
4.0,The dress itself looks good. It came slightly crumpled.
4.0,Daughter loved it. nice keepsake
4.0,"recommend it , feels like you are wearing in neck., like the weight """
4.0,"I Love this pin . It is heavy and if u have fine hair u might have to clip it to another  type of band in  your hair  first , or it may slide right out ."
4.0,"I normally wear a large, ordered a large and it's a tad too big. From reading other reviews, I did not expect that! I'll probably keep and hope it shrinks a bit. Color me confused."
4.0,"This hat is great quality. The mesh upper is great for breath ability and ventilation. It is high quality fabric and it looks great . I took off one star only because it is a bit too small. I know that is no fault of the compa, but they do not use standard hat sizes for their hats. THey use small, and large type sizes. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it 5 stars. Maybe once I break it in, it will be more comfortable. If so, I will update."
4.0,Elegant! They fit perfectly and feel comfortable.
4.0,"Very pretty and delicate.  The morganite stone was more of a peach color than pink like it's described, but still a good purchase."
4.0,"I followed the posted size charts and it fits perfect. I am 5'8 and a curvy150lbs, and the XL is right on the money. It is well made and will look best with a petticoat."
4.0,The buttons are loose. I have to tighten them all before wearing the dress
4.0,"From the picture I thought the material would be more fabric like, but in reality its more like tent material. But for the price the bag is well-made and study, so it was just what I wanted for when I needed to lug around things."
4.0,I ordered this ring as a birthday present for my sister.  We haven't yet been able to get together but I wanted to post my thoughts on the ring.<br /><br />This ring is beautiful.  If you like the way it looks in the picture I don't see how you could be disappointed with the actual ring.  The stones are really nice and the silver bright and shiny.  I tried it on and it is very comfortable ont he hand.  I'm sure my sister will love it.<br /><br />I only rated it 4 stars because my sister hasn't worn it yet so we don't know that it will be durable.
4.0,I'm 5'1 and the pants fit about an inch away from my ankle so if you are taller than 5'1 then the pants may be too short for you.
4.0,The shoes are beautiful and elegant but I didn't receive them in time for my special occasion.
4.0,"I love the style of these boots and the quality is great, but they run narrow compared with other Frye styles I've purchased."
4.0,Very comfortable and fit nicely but a little bit to long for me.
4.0,These masks are well made and are solid.  They have few moving parts to break :-)  I bought two of these for a photography project I was doing and I painted one of them white.  So although there is nothing special about a mask I was surprised at their quality when I received them.<br /><br />We will probably use them next Halloween and dress them up with feathers and sequins to make a His and Hers duo or a Venetian style mask.
4.0,I love the color but it was a little ripped before I tried it on (simple fixüòä) but once I tried it on I fell in love with the fit I can't wait to wear it for my ball coming up
4.0,"The snaps dont want to stay snapped when full  and there is no change purse , but otherwise its very nice"
4.0,"It works fine, but I think the soap flows back down every time.  So, it takes a bit longer than desired to get soap out."
4.0,Perfect fit for my Casio MDV-106
4.0,Nice velvet material.  Runs a little big.
4.0,Comfortable but need to order a smaller size
4.0,I received the wrong size. Ordered M and received S. Otherwise I love these sandals. I have a pair in another color and love them. They provide great support for high arches. They are soft and comfortable and a great relief for Plantar Fasciitis. I could wear them all day.
4.0,"Shorts are a bit small, it smelled like chemicals when I opened it but after a simple wash it went away. Other than that it's just like the picture."
4.0,It is a nicely fitted hoodie made with a heavy T-shirt material.  The zipper is a good quality.  Overall it is a nice hoodie / dress - but it is not going to keep you warm like a sweatshirt.  Perfect for when you need a little extra something.
4.0,"Pretty colors, and good quality product. My daughter and I had a hard time figuring out how to get it on with all our hair in it, but perhaps that just takes practice.  This is our first try using a satin cap like this, so we have nothing to compare it to, but it seems it would be beneficial to have a more snug fit around the band."
4.0,Beautiful watch. I can't believe that you can get such a beautiful product for this kind of money. I am wearing it for only a few days and so far I like it. Hopefully it will last.
4.0,I like the softness of the material on the inside and they are pretty breathable. However they are a bit small for my face and that is the only reason for 4 stars.
4.0,"Nice sunglasses, good quality and they filter out light nicely. Beware the ""polarized"" part, though. I have prescription polarized sunglasses and they are actual polarized - these don't come close in that department. But these are solid, and they look great on. They come in a nice case, too. For the price, you can't go wrong."
4.0,I absolutely love the dress and can‚Äôt wait to wear it out but it is completely see through. You definitely need a slip with it.
4.0,"Fit really well and stayed put, which was great, but out of three pairs, two got holes in the seams at the first wear. I didn't expect them to last particularly long, but more than one wear would've been nice."
4.0,Too many parts
4.0,They do cut down on the glare from headlights. I have cataracts and get the glare at night. They are not perfect but for the money I think they are worth it.
4.0,"Fit is small. Had to be returned,"
4.0,"This is beautiful replica of a Hussars jacket. The fabric is nice, and the fit is bang on.<br />However, whoever was paid to sew on the buttons did a really half-hearted job. One button fell off immediately after removing the jacket from the bag. Some of the other buttons are actually sewn on whilst others are basted on with one or two threads. Those will need to be resewn as they are simply hanging.<br />A nice jacket with poor quality control."
4.0,"Outfit is super cute, made well. We are using the pants for pj‚Äôs. Didn‚Äôt realize they were not tights. I ended up pairing the top with black leggings. Other than that, super cute!"
4.0,it is heavy and makes my ear sore but really pretty
4.0,"My mother loved it, I thought it was a little bit too large for my taste- perhaps a longer chain"
4.0,"I purchased for a bridal shower however when I tried it on it gave me more of a work vibe, but still a nice dress it is not a flimsy or sheer material so it will keep your warm as I read in another review if you live in hot climate it may become to sticky but for New England it perfect. Wish it did not have the belt loops but whatever."
4.0,These are pretty nice. I really like being able to keep my jewelry in when nonferrous metal is acceptable (such as in an mri). The black hasn't chipped or changed over the last few weeks so I'm pleased with that. Only problem I've had was that one of the spikes came off and when I went to thread it on it just spun and didn't tighten. I took a spike from the 2nd piece of jewelry and it threaded on. In essence the price doubled.
4.0,Using these for suitcase packing. They seem to work just fine! No leaks so far.
4.0,"Hat is too Small for my Head, but the neck warmer is great."
4.0,I got a 3x biggest size they had it didn't have pockets like it stated but that's cool I couldn't button the top few buttons so it will not be worn as a dress but I'm ok with that I was gonna wear it open with a cute top and jeans so all in all I love it
4.0,I wore this for my cousins confirmation  and it fit very well
4.0,It was a crowd hit but I would have gone for something a little more fashionable with more embroidery but they didn‚Äôt have my size.
4.0,"GET THESE IMMEDIATELY!!!<br />I am a plus sized woman, my normal jeans size is a 22 and I tend to carry a lot of weight in my stomach and hips.  I ordered the XXL and they fit like a dream!  No weird swearing-while-leg-kicking dance needed to get these on.  They are super soft which I was pleasantly surprised at.<br />The overall fit was slightly, ever so slightly, loose but not so much that I should have gone down a size.  Here's hoping I get to the point where I get to order an XL!  But today is not that day.<br />I am 5'8"" and have found it difficult to find workout pants like these that don't hit me right below the knee or are so long that they cover my feet.  These fit about mid-calf.  My calves are also fairly large and I didn't feel restricted in these and no weird crease was left in my skin when I took them off.<br />I haven't taken them out for a road test yet with phone in one pocket and keys in the other.  Should they not perform as expected, I'll update my review.  As of now; they are comfortable, not un-flattering and a great length and feel."
4.0,"I had to laugh because the masks look and feel like a pair of panties strapped across the face, but they do serve their purpose. They fit well and the cotton is breathable, and these would be great for the cooler days that are approaching. I like that they come in a pack of ten and are easily washable so you always have clean ones on hand. Now that they are a necessity in most places, I would recommend purchasing."
4.0,"Love this dress so much I bought another one, great for any occasion."
4.0,"These bibs are great, soft enough in the neck so they don't irritate your baby and snug enough to keep the food from sneaking down their neck."
4.0,"Good value, do what I need. won't fit wide earpieces"
4.0,"I LOVE them! They're incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly. I got size medium and I'm 5'3 140lbs. I didn't give 5 stars because they do look a little different than the photos, the photos look like cotton, these are polyester but they're still super cute. I would have obviously just preferred that they look like the photos. I included a photo to better show the material."
4.0,Nice think socks....like them
4.0,"I normally wear L, I read all of the comments and ordered XL, next time I will order XXL."
4.0,"I really liked the compression and ease of use, but these socks could be 1-2 inches shorter and the band at the top needs to be either wider, or less tight."
4.0,Product seems to run one size too small.
4.0,"elegant,well made and cool ! excellent price!."
4.0,I bought these for my 10 year old who wears a size 6 in shoes and weighs 100lbs. The colors are great and so is the material. What I didn‚Äôt like too much is that even for my 10 year old they were a bit tight and looked stretched out.
4.0,"So pretty and dainty. The clasp was a little difficult to connect but once it's on it's perfect.  Note that there is no extender as with most necklaces so if you have a thicker neck, or want it to hang longer,  you may want to pick one up."
4.0,"They were customized to me, so of course they fit as expected."
4.0,Pretty! Colors are on the vintagey side so they aren't super vibrant.
4.0,"The skirt is really cute but it runs big. I ordered a small and it fits like a medium. It has a lot of stretch and a lot of room. I didn't return it because I really like it and I plan on getting it tailored. If you're looking for a fitted skirt, this is not the one unless you're fine spending the extra money in tailoring it."
4.0,"The picture is a bit deceiving color wise, it's more pink than red, but that's online shopping right? Waist sizing chart is a bit off too."
4.0,"So far, these stud earrings have appeared to be of decent quality, but only time will tell. They don't look cheap and are a good alternative to diamond earrings for those who want a similar look without the high price, especially when it's your teenage son who wants diamond studs."
4.0,She LOVES THEM!
4.0,"If you like the minions, what can I say.  These are fun but a little tight getting them over my heel"
4.0,"I really liked them, they are very comfortable for everyday wear and don‚Äôt show any underwear lines."
4.0,"I picked these up for a pair of shoes that my son absolutely HAD to have but came with laces that he hasn't quite figured out how to tie.  Although they were more for me so I didn't have to tie his shoes constantly - he loves the level of independence they've given him while also looking awesome!  My only complaint is that you are supposed to slide the little metal head on the lace, then knot it where you want it, and trim off the rest.  That's all good and fine, but the bottom edge of the heads are narrow and flat and the knot doesn't fit inside as it is shown in the picture - but it's not a super big deal for us.  Just know that it may not look as clean as you thought it would."
4.0,"I have been buying these socks for a long time.  I would rate the 5 stars, but they wear out a little too soon on the bottom of the heel.  Still a good buy."
4.0,It's nice but it can be difficult to take off.
4.0,Very cute and comfy!! Definitely think you can smell everything through them
4.0,Easy to remove and put on<br />Comfortable and cute
4.0,"Fabric is soft, feels good against my skin, but rolls down in the front when sitting, or moving around."
4.0,Easy-on easy off with sturdy enough soles to walk on gravel. I wear 10 1/2 and the slipper was size 11 and the fit is good. I would order a bit larger than your normal and would would recommend these slippers at $16.99.
4.0,Looks good.  Works well.  However the pics make the &#34;ring & triangle&#34; sections of the face look grey when they are actually a light brown like coffee with cream.
4.0,"I‚Äôm calling this super cute little piece ‚Äìa ‚Äúdress‚Äù. It is very simple, short, sexy, and pretty. It‚Äôs also amazingly affordable. Wanted to get the attention of someone I‚Äôve had my eye on at a fave nightclub. Decided to do something outrageous, so I wore this nightgown. Panties underneath of course. It worked well. Took the photos of me after the evening was over ‚Ä¶ very late!<br />The ‚Äúdress‚Äù has adjustable straps. There are also two rows of wire double hookeye catches in the back exactly like a bra closure. The closure is camouflaged by a flap of cloth.  OK, I get it ‚Äìit‚Äôs lingerie, but this type of fastener is simple and secure. A few decades ago when my waist was a 26, the 1st row of hookeyes would have been about right. Today the 2nd row is OK ‚Äìnot too tight. I bought size small.<br />When the item arrived there was a very slight amount of red dye bleed into the white lace on the back, which is why I gave it a 4. Washing it in cold gently by hand with a half a dozen drops of shampoo followed by a gentle cold rinse did not cause further bleed. Put in the clothes dryer on low heat to tumble gently with several well used clean and already dry white bath towels for half hour. This may have helped to set the dye. No problems since then.<br />At age 60+, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 140 lb. 36B 28 36"
4.0,It's OK is a bracelet
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture. I love it! I will enjoy wearing this.
4.0,These were my first caps to wear at work. I found them to fit great and I loved the adjustable piece in the back but I didn‚Äôt like how sweaty/itchy my forehead would get after wearing them for a few hours. I definitely couldn‚Äôt handle them for my full 12 hour shift. They are cute and work well for long hair.
4.0,Great service and great products
4.0,"I bought the purple Jack Skellington sweater in a Large! I am 5 ft7 and and a little curvy, it covers my bottom and keeps me warm. It fits perfect. The purple is a very bright purple and the graphics on the sweater are very cute, although some of them look a little smooshed. It doesnr bother me though,Jack's face covers the front and some along the back. A great buy for any Nightmare before Christmas fans!"
4.0,I really like this jacket...had to take a star away for the collar NOT being detachable as is stated in the washing instructions.  I am not a fan of the hot itchy faux squirrel tail trim layered on my neck.  The Green is Darker and more understated in color than I washing for like in the photo but its very pretty nonetheless. The gold zippers good looking and yet are not super smooth but look nice and the bit of extra finishing pinstripe trim in dark brown looks nice too. Fit is true to measurements and even though it is not heavy in weight its warm.
4.0,"I really like the color and fabric, very pretty. The top is a little bigger than I thought, but I can get the straps adjusted and it should be good to go. I would by this again."
4.0,Love it matched perfect
4.0,I purchased and they did fit true to size but not flattering at all on my body type. Felt too much like granny panties to me as well.
4.0,"Got the dress for a wedding and it was perfect, material is not too thin at all. Has a very sleek and classy appeal. The slit it high and really just shows when you walk. Next time I wear it, I may put a safety pin in so not so much leg shows. The only thing really I'd say as a 'warning' is that the halter top part is a bit narrow. I am 5'5.5 120bs, and a 34B cup, if my breasts were any bigger, I probably would have had a 'side-boob' issue. Luckily I didn't have any issues, wore silicone pasties since there's an open back on the dress and everything was perfect. Also, length was perfect too, I was able to wear heals with the dress."
4.0,"I loved this suit until my boyfriend called it my grandma swim suit. : / Still cute though, and I feel comfortable in it since it covers my belly. The top is soo flattering also!"
4.0,Super comfy but I wish the insoles didn‚Äôt slide. They come out of slipper with my foot.
4.0,"As a loose item it is true to size. I must say it is not the soft buttery material I assumed it to be. It is firmer somehow. Not bad and I do love it. Just know it is a baggy item and a firmer fabric. Color is as pictured, no idea why it's called orange. And buttons work, for anyone looking for that feature . Personally, the price is ok for a long sleeve Henley since it is a basic item I dont know that I would get more."
4.0,"I originally ordered a small on the basis of what many people were saying in the reviews, but returned it for a medium.  It is a much better fit and a very classy dress.  My husband really likes it so that is also a plus.  My only concern is that it is badly wrinkled.  I'm hoping that with gentle ironing  and steam will make the deep creases will go away."
4.0,They must be fine.  My wife took them ;-)
4.0,These are perfect for a budget thug!
4.0,Rings still looking like new and I'm an er nurse and my husband does construction a good buy
4.0,It's leather as advertised. A little smaller than expected. I like none the less ‚ù§
4.0,"Cute, but I returned.  I ordered multiple dresses and preferred a different style  It wasn't as dressy as I hoped for the occasion.  Nice summer dress."
4.0,"This dress isn't very forgiving if you have got a bit of a tummy, because its very thin and fits to your form. I love it with a sweater over it, or a cardigan."
4.0,beautiful necklace. the chime is much quieter than I expected it to be.
4.0,"Nice and lightweight! These are fairly slim for a guy I think, didn‚Äôt try in on my hubby tho!"
4.0,"I think the watch looks sharp on, but the one negative is that the face of the watch is a bit dark. Keeping time at this point perfectly.  Otherwise, a nice-looking watch and I like it."
4.0,"I‚Äôd say these sports bras from BraNurY run small. I‚Äôm a 34A, so if I followed their size chart, I would wear a size small. But I had a feeling the bras would run small, so I went with my usual size: medium. And that was the right decision, because even the medium bras are a bit tight.<br /><br />I laid one on top of a comparable style Nike sports bra and it was smaller. The band *and* bust were smaller by about an inch.<br /><br />However, the sports bras are really comfortable to wear. They don‚Äôt feel super tight or constrictive, so go with your normal size. They offer light support, so I wear them for lounging or light activities, and I forget I‚Äôm wearing one. I like the wide band, it‚Äôs 3 inches wide and soft. Sometimes wide bands sit at the wrong spot on my ribcage, but these are very comfortable.<br /><br />The description says hand wash only, but I machine wash the sports bras on the gentle cycle, then line dry. They wash well, with no signs of fading or pilling."
4.0,Very sweet little shoes .  Got them for Halloween for my daughters butterfly costume<br /> I was very nervous because some of the reviews said was you didn‚Äôt light up very happy when both of the shoes worked perfectly .<br /> I do wish you could change the batteries though they lasted for a decent amount of time.  But if your kid is planning on wearing them every day you‚Äôre not gonna get too much use out of the lights  I wanna say they probably got 40 hours of light ( now that I‚Äôm trying to think about it it‚Äôs really hard to gauge and one did die before the other<br /><br />But very cute and my daughter loves them so I‚Äôm happy with them
4.0,These are cute masks but my only complaint is they are too big for my daughter's face so she has to tie them back. Otherwise they seem good.
4.0,"I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter and it fit great. She ranges between M-L, so I ordered a Large. She loves it"
4.0,"The top fits pretty well, but the bottoms were definitely too small and no stretch. Not bad, but I'm going to have to purchase separate‚Äã bottoms."
4.0,I like the outfit but I don't know why the pants have to be 8 &#34; longer than they should be
4.0,Gorgeous ring. Fast shipping. Size runs smaller than expected but I love it
4.0,"I LOVE the minimalist design of this wallet. The material feels sturdy. There are enough pockets to carry the cards I use 80% of the time (no need to carry more than necessary). The magnet for securing the money is extremely strong. The card window is simple an convenient.<br /><br />However... I thought I could use my RFID embedded transit pass for contactless use when passing through the turnstile. The problem is card reader at the turnstile also senses the RFID chip in my credit and visa card as well, which forces me to pull my transit pass card out each time. RFID blocking capacity of the wallet does not mean it prevents or blocks RFID signals from bankcards on the opposite side of the wallet. This is a nuisance (I know...first world problems).<br /><br />Next time, I will need to invest in a wallet that has a 'flap' for the ID card window"
4.0,"Good for the price. Quality isn't GREAT, but it's not a bad lounging around top."
4.0,"Fun items and looks great with matching jacket.  BOTH run small and very LONG!  Heads up if you are short, this would be a challange to hem.  But if you can wear high heels, no worry.<br /><br />I accidently wore it the first time with the ruffles in the back instead of on the side....so you have options!"
4.0,"These are working out well. I wear them everywhere‚Äî to the store, around the house etc. seem to be holding up well"
4.0,"The lace is easy to snag, but otherwise these are very good quality and super cute. They are even have a little grip to the fingers which I found helpful throughout the day."
4.0,"My friend loveslot  this ring, and thinks I spent a lot of money on it. We won't tell him if did't."
4.0,Width seemed a little narrow compared to similar frames I tried. They looked as pictured although the blue and brown were lighter than expected. Otherwise they seemed to be of good quality.
4.0,"I ordered size L based on the size chart on this product page because it seems this blouse will run small, I normally wear size M. However, when I get this blouse I realize that the size chart is not accurate as estimated. The blouse is somewhat larger than I expected. As I do not have time to ship it back I gave it as a gift to one of my friend who normally wear size L. She likes it very much and love the material and designs. I decide to buy another smaller one soon."
4.0,Wow these sunglasses make it much easier to see cuts glare no zero.<br />I wish they were slightly larger so they wouldn't sit and put pressure on my glasses' nose bridge.<br />Can't wait to take them fishing.
4.0,Super cute. I bought absolutely the wrong size. Not at all wearable. Trying again in a larger size.<br />34b 130lbs
4.0,"The fit is right and the styling ain't bad. Materials felt decent, not flimsy.<br /><br />The pants lost 1 star for the weird design of pockets. In back, there are 2 slash pockets with fake flaps under the opening that doesn't have pockets under the flap. So it's a real pocket with a fake pocket sewn on top. The right thigh has a zipper that opens to nothing, just a zipper that unzips to show the fabric underneath.<br /><br />There are no cargo pockets on the side, more to the middle of the thigh pointing forward.<br /><br />But for the price, this will be a fine casual pant to wear around town, but don't think it'll replace a real 5.11 or TruSpec cargo pant."
4.0,"Worked great to stretch shoes both in length and width. The attachments for bunions ect don't stay in, so you can't tip the stretcher when putting into the shoe or they fall off."
4.0,"The only thing different was the strips on the shoulders, in the pic is a flat strip and the one I was sent has two fine strips en each crossed strip. Other than that, very nice material and fits nicely."
4.0,"It is a cute bracelet. The Elephant is starting to turn a bit silver after wearing it for only a week but other than that, it is very well manufactured. I really like that the beads are not strung with cheap string/elastic. I got the 6mm beads, which are a bit small but they look nice on me because I have very small wrists. If you are looking for a typical size bead then I recommend going with the 8mm."
4.0,very cute necklaces
4.0,"I like the color and the design. I just didn't take into account that being a crocheted design like that, you were bound to feel a little roughness when sitting on that pattern for any length of time. Also, again because it is such an open weave, it is prone to catching individual threads on any small projection and snagging easier, so you do have to be careful what you get close to."
4.0,The swimsuit is well constructed; however I did not like how I looked in it. Once I lose some weight will probably buy again
4.0,This shirt is so freaking cute ! ! The chest is too small that the buttons open up. I am going to try sewing it up around the buttons. so wish me luck. its too cute not to alter it. so 4 stars
4.0,the small fits like a medium. medium like a large and so on.  Actually nice shorts/material of decent quality. Though i received wrong size Amazon made it right and i will be ordering the correct size for me. little larger than american sizing standards.
4.0,crunch toes a bit but stay put!
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that these fit the whole family well (one per person for the wise crackers out there).<br /><br />They work decent as protection against the wind - slight negative is that it was not as warm, but for the price it is decent."
4.0,"The only reason I'm not leaving a perfect review is that the sequins are extremely sharp in the entire upper body area. Everywhere it touched me, it left a rash! I'm going to keep the dress, but now I have to have a seamstress possibly go through and fix where they are bent inwards. Otherwise, it's freaking beautiful! The corset back makes it easy to fit most body types and if I get some boob tape, it'll look phenomenal!"
4.0,"Cute, wish chain was a bit longer."
4.0,"Comfortable, causal dress!"
4.0,"I was surprised by how thoughtful the packaging was for such simple costume jewelry; it was thoughtful. The inclusion to two backings was similarly thoughtful, although they are the cheaper-styled backings that I find uncomfortable. I should also note I am very sensitive to poor metals in costume jewelry, and so far, so good on these.<br /><br />One note: this larger size I thought would go well with holiday party outfits. They are lovely, but I found myself surprised that they seem to angle off oddly on my ears. This caught me by surprise, as I had never noticed this with other earrings - I guess the large size makes this more visible. I will buy the smaller size in the future for everyday wear; I lost my old pair. I will also buy more of the other backings that I find more comfortable and replace the ones I was provided with."
4.0,"A little too snug.  But that might just be a sizing difference from one country to another.  It's very cozy and soft and warm, but if I get another, I will get one size larger, just for the roominess and length. All in all, not bad."
4.0,Interesting information about the culture and religion of my ancestors.
4.0,"They are just a little big around the sides of my feet. They are beautiful though, sturdy material. Chains just shouldn't hang so low"
4.0,"ok deal for the cost, not quality, but useful"
4.0,Arrived as described. Fits well
4.0,"Wrong color.<br />I bought the green, love it. I wanted grey... the grey is blue. :( It looks like an old acid washed dark denim blend."
4.0,it‚Äôs pretty cute however i wish the sleeves were a little longer but it‚Äôs still really cute and will still wear!
4.0,Very nice looking.  Sometimes you want to wear your watch but need a fancier band. That part is great.<br />But getting it on and off for me has been difficult. Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong but when I try to open a link to put it on the band comes apart. It goes back together but it‚Äôs impossible for me to put on and off by myself.<br />I‚Äôm hoping to hear from customer service on how to deal with that.
4.0,The cord that this comes with is waaaay too short! Ouch! Luckily I had a spare cord I could transfer it to. The stone itself is lovely.
4.0,"Cute little necklace, was as expected."
4.0,"Love them, love them"
4.0,I love everything from THS Harem Store. I have bought four pants and three skirts. Super comfortable.
4.0,"The earrings are cute, however, they are not really leather. They are foam or they look like some sort of foam. I gave them as a gift and the receiver seemed happy. I do think that the seller should state they are faux leather though. It‚Äôs misleading."
4.0,Comfortable and I receive so many compliments
4.0,It‚Äôs short so beware.
4.0,Very light hat. A little tight for big guys. Will work great for me to keep the hair out my face.
4.0,"This is a cute shirt! I've had the same style in a different design in the past.<br />I'm usually a US size L w/ 36C bust. I ordered a Large with this shirt and I have no problem wearing it. I would say it fits me comfortably on the top part and slightly loose at the bottom half. It's a really boxy shirt! I wear it with high waisted pants just so that the bottom half won't look too loose or like a balloon. This shirt makes your look flowy, but the shape doesn't match it. I would buy the other designs/color."
4.0,Great quality sock! My son loves them. They are think and do not slide.
4.0,"neat shades<br />the lens seems kinda frosted<br />nice colors<br />very bright<br />doesn't feel comfy on my ears or nose<br />it is wide so it'll fit everyone differently i guess<br />overall, it's cool!!"
4.0,Works well on long flights.  Can cram my toes.
4.0,ordered this because the first time I ordered it doorknobs came in the package ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don‚Äôt think the sizes are true I‚Äôm normally a medium and it‚Äôs a little bit too tight should‚Äôve got a large Not sure I would try a third time but you know what they say
4.0,I am 5'7 115 lb. ordered small. it's a great quality swimsuit but for short body type. as it was mentioned in the other reviews boobs are on the tummy . gave it to my friend. service was great and came earlier then i expected.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:793f6187e30180b189fcd43d2c1c0a00]] When I received my jacket, I was so excited. Popped the 3 batteries in and it lit up perfect. 5 minutes later I noticed everytime my left arm was down, the left side would go off but would stay on at a certain arm height. I tore open the jacket and noticed it needed to be re-soldered. So i took to soldering it but then released it wasn't the normal metal for soldering, I needed a specific metal (I can't remember now, it was a few months ago and I am too tired to google it. the normal stuff was just dripping off). I somehow got some metal to stick and my jacket worked like new! The battery life lasts around 3 hours but I usually just carried a couple packs I got at the dollar store. The battery pack didn't move either inside. For the price and the DIY, it was worth it. Buying in the future? I'd reccomend either knowing how to solder or buying one of better quality. However, the COLORS and patterns this thing twinkles is UNREAL. I am IN LOVE. It doesn't stretch tho so if youre inbetween, size up"
4.0,This top runs large. I should have bought a smaller size.  Comfortable big top!
4.0,"It's good, I would buy another."
4.0,"I originally bought this for an adult, but texture is fuzzier than it looks and fits a child better."
4.0,"very cute, and well made, but consider going up a size if you don't want to wear it really tight."
4.0,"This is a great product for summer cycling and running to help keep the sun damage to a minimum. It is a little difficult to get on, especially during transition from the swim to bike, but once it's on, it stays put. I did get some chafing the first time I used it, but since then, I have not. It washes nicely, too. It does run small -- I normally would wear a small and got a medium based on the sizing chart, and it's certainly snug."
4.0,"If it wasn't so large, I would love it. I purchased a medium since I am normally between a small and medium but this fits more like a large/xlarge. very big in every area of the jacket."
4.0,"I wanted a bag that would please a little girl and was roomy enough to hold her books, crayons, paper dolls, etc. to carry from one location to another during her summer vacation.  This bag was ideal to suit my purpose."
4.0,"This is one of those flowy summer dresses that is acceptable to wear just about anywhere for anything. It looks flattering but not racy. It sits at my waist but isn't tight so I find it comfortable to wear for a whole day out. The material is a bit thicker than I expected so it will get hot if you are outside all day. That is really the only reason for taking a star off. Otherwise, it fits nice and falls just above my knees to make me feel safe wearing it. I don't prefer the dresses that are super short.<br /><br />I threw it in with a load of delicates in the washing machine and then low heat/tumble in the dryer. It came out fine and no shrinking or pilling.<br /><br />One final note, it doesn't take wrinkles easily, so it would make a good packing dress. Very little maintenance for this one."
4.0,"The necklace is off seemingly good quality silver, but the clasp is hard to open, and it often gets stuck in my hair. However, it is a beautiful necklace for the price."
4.0,"This dress was so pretty! I wanted to love it, but it runs kind of big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and about 140 lbs and I ordered a medium (my usual size). The length was perfect and hit just below my knees, however it was too loose in the waist and hips. I would recommend sizing down. The material was thick enough to where if you do, it will hug you properly and look great!"
4.0,This real comfortable and fun to ear.
4.0,This dress is cute and comfortable
4.0,Only problem is having to dry flat. Wish I could put in dryer...
4.0,Item was what we expected it to be.  It has held up well to being worn and has not tarnished.
4.0,Nice decorative pillows. Attractive without feeling stiff and cheap.
4.0,Great Thank you !!!
4.0,"Great looking cleats. I bought them for my sons birthday, I was a bit disappointed that they were orange. I thought they were red(my son's favorite color). I wouldn't have bought them if I knew."
4.0,It was comfortable It's just a little too tight at the chest. Planning on returning it.
4.0,"Based on the reviews I sized up. I'm between a 34 and a 36 B. I ordered a 38 B. It's very snug and it creates cleavage. I was pleasantly surprised. If I were a true 36 B, I doubt it would fit me. So don't be afraid to size up. I might buy a black one if it lasts."
4.0,"Love the sweater and very comfortable! However, if you want it to look like the model, order a size up. I got a small as that is what I usually wear. 137 lbs 5'4"" for reference. It's a tighter fit, but I still like it. Plan on getting more colors, but will order a medium instead."
4.0,"I would have liked to have a bigger bag, but this one did great! It held most everything well and the strap was adjustable to my liking."
4.0,beautiful dress would have been perfect if it fit her :(
4.0,It is a little too long for me.
4.0,"I have a pretty big head, I wear 7 5/8 hats, and these bandanas were more than large enough for my head. I use them as sweatbands when I work and they do a great job. The printed words are quite big, 1 inch tall, but they are not visible after you fold them up, I would definitely order these again."
4.0,Thanks so much for this! The strings were a little dislocated. but it's fine! I LOVE them!
4.0,"Got these as a gift for my wife and she loved them.  She has worn them at least 20 times since she got them, so I know she likes them.  They are very classy and she has gotten compliments on them from some of her friends.  I would recommend this product."
4.0,"Fit is not good, I am 34D, ordered M and it is loose around armholes,"
4.0,Q little wider than expected
4.0,This dress ran enormously large. I have to wear it with a belt even after taking it in. That being said the print is gorgeous and the price wasn‚Äôt bad.
4.0,"Liked the band.  It has however continued to stretch quite a bit so that I am now on the last hole.  No biggie, I can always make more holes."
4.0,"I purchased these for my mother, she said they were a little small for her (she's a 38C in her bra) but mostly sent them back because she didn't like the foam built-in cups. I didn't try them on but they felt like nice material and were pretty colors."
4.0,All was very nicely made I haven't had any break yet but I've only had for just a few weeks
4.0,"Good cold weather running tights that are not too ""revealing""."
4.0,"I love it but it's too small at xxxl. I'm 5'9"" tall, 263 lbs. and considerably top heavy and it fits everywhere except in my middle or belly area (bulges out). I'd have to lose another 20-30lbs to wear this shirt comfortably but am considering keeping it to do so for the great price and the quality and overall look of the shirt. If you normally wear a 3x or 22/24 top or dress size, this xxxl most likely will be too small for you if you have a belly you want to cover."
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured and worked for what I needed. The pictures are definitely hard to get in and can‚Äôt do it without bending/creasing/scratching the pictures. Other then that is was ok.
4.0,"These gloves are great for driving! The lamb skin leather is soft and supple. The fit is snug, but that‚Äôs good because when you are gripping the wheel in the midst of some spirited driving, you don‚Äôt want a bunch of gappy material getting in the way or slipping around! Also, they look really good!<br /><br />My only complaint, and the reason why the gloves get 4 stars instead of 5, is that the touchscreen capability wears off. Initially, the gloves worked great for capacitive touch sensitive devices like smart phones, touchscreens, and those scratch/scribble/track pads for car infotainment systems, but gradually they stopped working. First the center of the thumb or forefinger stopped working, but enetually the whole surface of the stitched on pads failed to register on touch sensitive devices. It‚Äôs like there was some sort of coating that rubbed off the gloves. I can see no visible damage, wear, or fraying, so i don‚Äôt know what the problem is.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the gloves are still great for driving. And really you shouldn‚Äôt be messing around with a phone while you‚Äôre driving, anyway..."
4.0,So cute! Sleeves were shorter then I expected but it's really soft and good quality so I love it!
4.0,I bought this mostly for my stomach area because I have gained a little bit of weight. I just got it today and it fits good. I am usually a size medium but I did get a large. The only problem I have is that the bottom area needs to be more slimming to your body. It's too loose around my butt and thighs. I did get the one with the zipper in the middle of my belly and it seems pretty sturdy. Will definitely need more time to see if it actually helps
4.0,"I really loved this shirt! Way too short to be a dress, but looks just as good work as a shirt! I ordered a XXL."
4.0,Great feel. Great quality. Order a size down if you want a fit likw the picture. Im a L and a M would have neen perfect fit.
4.0,Product came as expected and looks just like the picture.  The top is more of a polyester material and the yellow is quite bright.  Much brighter than I expected but overall it is a nice dress.
4.0,"This looks very nice, the only thing is...I would have liked it better if it were on a corded string or something other than plastic/rubber."
4.0,"They're super cute but I'm unable to fit them on my foot, I'm recovering from a high ankle sprain and still too swollen to get them on. (3 months post injury) If you're swollen at all, you won't be able to fit them on your foot."
4.0,"Cute and comfy leggings for lounging around or working from home. However, they definitely aren't tummy control as advertised, but they are comfy!"
4.0,The only reason it‚Äôs rated 4 stars is due to how large they are.
4.0,The pin remover tips could be more durable. So many come in a package thankfully because it was the last one that allowed me to finish sizing the links.
4.0,"These are nice, fun pants, but they definitely run small. I am 5'2&#34; and a curvy size 14, and the large just don't fit. Also they are clearly made for someone with longer legs. The fabric is thin but not see-through and the pants look good. I just wish they made an XL."
4.0,"Really like these bags, but the brown one is awkwardly small and doesn‚Äôt really fit a cell phone because of the shape."
4.0,cute. pleased with my purchase. I'm 5'8&#34; and the dress hits above the ankle but still a nice length.
4.0,this is just what I was looking for! I wanted a watch that had color and design on the face. The only thing is that it is thicker than I am used to. But that's OK.
4.0,"Based on previous reviews I opted for a larger size and its fits just right, I'm usually a med/large and it is reasonable for the price. However, there were large pen marks near the waistband, indicating it may have been used or damage previously. I did not buy it used and it was sealed seemingly, in its plastic packing. It is a good product for what you are paying but I wish it wasn't damaged. Otherwise they are perfect thin leggings, almost thick enough to wear alone but I personally wouldn't recommend it...great for layering."
4.0,"The only reason I did not give this shirt 5 stars is the sizing, it runs small.  The quality and craftsmanship of the garment is really good. The style is on par with current standards and the color is very vivid. Normally if something doesn't fit I give it to a smaller friend of mine, but since my new diet is working and I have lost 14lbs in the last 2 months, I'm keeping it in hopes that in the next month or so i can wear it."
4.0,This is such a great piece of jewelry and has a very authentic feel! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a smaller pendant than expected but certainly not too small to see the details in person.
4.0,"it was ok. It fits well, and it is good as described.<br />little bit of damage and scratch even thought packaged really well...<br />Other than that it is fine, looks just like the picture in the page.<br />It looks good. Really comfortable to wear because it is light-weighted."
4.0,Different/stiffer material than I thought but perfect fit & pretty colors
4.0,not for me for my daughter
4.0,I love the fit but the white inside part was hard to keep it from hanging out.
4.0,"A gift I purchased for my neice who is a cosmetologist. However, she loved it."
4.0,The arm length is great but the body is a bit short. Always feels like it‚Äôs riding up.
4.0,Amazing watch for the price. Friends have mistaken it for an iWatch. Arrived with the right time and date. Thanks!
4.0,I thought this shirt was a bit overpriced for a t-shirt.
4.0,Very nice but one came broke.
4.0,Rly pretty kinda thin material but overall very nice
4.0,"It fits well and looks good, but the material is comical!  It has no stretch, and seems to be made of molded  plastic.  I couldn't wear it in great heat, because it's so thick.  So-- good fit, nice look and style, fine price, but bizarre material (for a bathing suit - but fine for a place mat)."
4.0,"Runs a little small. I would like more coverage to the backside,  but. Will keep it."
4.0,"very tight on top and tend to cut off my circulation, still very comfortable and don't slip off my feet."
4.0,"It is very cute, feels good on but it seems large, I ordered medium, didn‚Äôt realize I should have ordered small."
4.0,"The belt is cute.  It looks a little cheap and that's why I docked a star.  Some reviewers were saying that the belt was not long enough to wear as shown, but this has not been my experience.  Because of those reviews I ordered the next size up and no I have a little more belt than I bargained for but it does not look silly so I will be keeping the belt.  My suggestion, however, is to order true to your waist measurement."
4.0,"Fit fine. Definitely cuter in the picture than in person. VERY cheap fabric, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting too much for the price."
4.0,"I love these beads and I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. The only thing that bothers me a little bit is that I was supposed to get 130 pieces and I counted 120...other than that, I‚Äôll be purchasing again!"
4.0,"very good, only issue is a bit small for the listed size !"
4.0,Very cute. I'm 5'3&#34; and it's a little short.
4.0,"Beautifully made, yet a little on the narrow side."
4.0,I bought one for my boyfriend with same description and his material ended up being different than mine so they aren't exactly the same which is what I expected. But the color and design is nice.
4.0,"I'm 5'7, 215.  2 months postpartum.  Ordered 2x based on the size chart and it fit ok.  Didn't like the fact that you probably need a shorter torso so it can fit like the picture, but it will do!<br /> Took a chance because I like the flow and wanted a shirt like this."
4.0,"Fits as expected, but see-through.  So make sure you have seemless panties and/or a matching color."
4.0,"Super cute, quality is good. To short for me as a dress so I wear it as a tunic. Love it!"
4.0,"I thought I had lost my onyx earrings, so I ordered these. Wouldn't you know, but I found them. Still, I liked the shape of these, so I kept them. They do have a very nice sparkle to them. Black is my favorite &#34;color&#34; so I can wear these earrings to dress up/dress down the outfits. I also like the elliptical shape, rather than a more conventional round onyx.  One thing I wish: since the studs slide into a jacket, there isn't much of a stem on the back that comes through. I wish the stem were just a hair longer, because it worries me that the backing could fall off and I'd lose the earring. For that reason, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5."
4.0,"I like the tank.<br />It is ok material at this cheap price..<br />I wear  normally large, so by other reviews went with XLarge. and it fits good.<br />Would have been too tight if I did not go up size!! Opening under arm is bit wide easy fix to take it up though."
4.0,"It's a bit too small but I did wear it to work today and it was ok, and it's ideal for the office.  I suggest to seller to have more info as to how many inches it is all around."
4.0,"Largest size did not fit the wife who wears L, sometimes XL, shirts. The seller refunded us, without any hassle. Beware of sizing. This is real leather, very well made, however, leather does not stretch, like pu leather does."
4.0,It was a gift and don't know if he used it yet
4.0,"Didn't need, but price was cheap as an add-on item, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm 5'2&#34; and approx. 150 lbs, ordered a large and it fit perfectly.  This is a very lightweight, sheer top, but very cute and stylish."
4.0,"Wore these to a wedding (in the summer) - I guess with the warmth and the dancing I wouldn‚Äôt have really expected any sticky boobs to stay on! I had to just take them off part way though the evening Though, as they were falling off too much. Again, given the circumstances not surprising, but would have been nice to have them a little longer."
4.0,That makes a world artificially bright at night... They are cheap glasses but I don't wear them for style I wear them for function.
4.0,Very pretty and nice fabric. Also a great fit.
4.0,"I like the shirt overall. It is a very relaxed fit so works well for many body types.<br />Pros: loose fit, bright color, comfortable<br />Cons: 100% polyester can be a hot in the summer, back hangs a little funny on me.<br />Would recommend."
4.0,Thes are not as expected. They look kinda big but they are small to me cause I like big earring. The advertising pictures look big. So yes it was a little disappointing when I got them.
4.0,"Nothing to complain about so far except cheap plastic hooks for the string. Can be worn without,  so not a big deal."
4.0,"I was apprehensive about purchasing these pants but, they look pretty similar to the picture.  The waist is a bit small and not as stretchable as you would expect.  The material is also thin so you should watch what you wear underneath the pants.  I would order a size up if I had to do it all again.  Overall good buy for the price."
4.0,"Very nice, I gave it as a gift to my friend which she enjoyed."
4.0,"Beautiful, lightweight, dressy casual, and flirty pair of super comfortable pants. These are s not large but for the price I didn‚Äôt care. Love these-will order one size smaller next time. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 149lbs. Medium would be better-I ordered a large to cover my middle aged tummy."
4.0,"It's OK, there is a line in the middle of it I didn't notice on picture. Not wild about that."
4.0,The quality is good overall.
4.0,"I am 5'9"" and weight 140#.  I started with the small and could get into it, but it was far too tight.  Then went to medium, same issue.  The large ended up working.  Seems to be made well enough.  Recommend, but be ready to have to make a return or two."
4.0,Color and design as expected. Scarf is a little bulky.
4.0,Super cute for the price! I haven't taken it off and it's been 2 months!
4.0,"It's a cheap hat, but perfect for my husband's Halloween costume. I ordered another hat beforehand (from Kangaroo; don't order from them) that was $5 cheaper (~$9 vs. ~14) and it showed up defective. This one showed up as advertised! Goes to show what paying a miniscule amount extra will give you. It also fits larger heads, which is a plus."
4.0,Cute but doesn't always lay like a want it to.
4.0,A little tight but super cute and made with good material!
4.0,Pretty nice dress. True to color and great fit. I'm 170lbs and the large fits well
4.0,"I absolutely loved this tracksuit. I got sooo many compliments and I felt super cute wearing it. I am pretty short, so my only con is that pant legs were extremely long, but easily fixed with some double sided fashion tape. I would highly recommend."
4.0,"Great Poncho. the snaps are metal, not plastic, which is nice, and the included cord is a nice material, and is coyote brown, matching the Multicam pattern. One important note, if you're using this poncho with the intent of wearing it with military gear is that you would have a difficult time using the hood if you are wearing a helmet, unlike a military issue poncho which keeps this in mind. I am a smaller guy, and wear a medium size helmet, and was BARELY able to put the hood on. If i was any bigger, or if my helmet was bigger, it would have been impossible."
4.0,"My husband loved them. He's about 5'10. they came down to his knees..just shy, but they were a good length.  Great for comfort."
4.0,"Decent enough quality.  Thin material.  Not a fan of the pockets- will make anyone look like a pear.  But perfect for the purpose I intended.  It makes a lovely nightgown.  No, I wouldn‚Äôt wear as a dress."
4.0,"it was ok, but the material was so thin. it arrived on time. (nothing of a waist trainer)"
4.0,The sweatshirt was exactly what I expected.  Thank you
4.0,"Very cute, nice quality and color. Does run a tad big and the picture length is off, it is a midi dress (falls mid calf on me- 5‚Äô4). It has pockets and is very comfortable- will be with booties!"
4.0,Very cute. We both like them.
4.0,Wore this dress for my brothers wedding. It worked out great. I felt good in the dress. The only alteration was to the straps they were a bit too long... as you can see in the pic....my sister did not have her straps altered and they were falling off her shoulder. Dresses were still beautiful though.
4.0,"Absolutely love this dress; however, it is extremely short on me. The fabric is nice and love the tie as the waist.  Sad to say I have to return."
4.0,love these but the nose thing broke within a week
4.0,"Really cute leopard print jeggings, but not very warm. Only back pockets are functional."
4.0,It all depends on how you want your clothes to fit. I brought this for my wife in XL- large. She's 5'5 and between 164-174 pounds. It fits nice on her. I really don't like the design.
4.0,The leather looks cheap but good wallet nonetheless.
4.0,I loved the color and the size was really close to what it‚Äôs suppose to be.
4.0,"This was a 5th birthday present for my child. She loves the watch greatly and plays with it often. However the screen is prone to scratches and cracks so you need to be careful with it. Overall, this watch is great for its price!"
4.0,"Good casual standby...purchased three in different colors. Great for travel, layering in cooler weather and it works for sleepwear sometimes too! It could be a bit thicker though.<br />Update: Looking at this review, now there is a different dress shown. I did buy this one also but I don‚Äôt like it quite as well, sleeves are tight on my average arms."
4.0,The only problem is turning it on trying to find the little button to press... You turn it on but then it's a mission to press to turn it on or turn it off other than that it's a good product
4.0,"I thought it would run small and ordered the medium, I'm 5'8 and 34-25-37. But sadly it came big. So it is true to size, small would've fit ne perfectly"
4.0,These are a little large and loose. They come with a very sturdy glass case that I absolutely love.
4.0,"My seven year old son loves playing mini golf, and he makes it a point to wear this hat each and every time we hit the course!"
4.0,Love this cute little dress!
4.0,The bill on the hat I received is MUCH longer than what is shown in photo. This changes the balance and looks of the hat.
4.0,"I am 5' 9&#34; and the dress comes to my ankles. The dress is very nice for the price and would have been perfect for my son's evening wedding. However, the zipper is not sewn correctly so it bulges out at the bottom of the zipper, which was at the top of my butt.<br /><br />I typically wear a large (175 lbs) but I had to order the medium as the large was too big."
4.0,The medium fit perfectly and everyone knew the character it represented. The only drawback is that the material was not as breathable as I expected and this created a lot of heat.
4.0,Cute getting all colors havnt wore yet
4.0,These shoes run big..cute and colors are true to pictures..I ordered a second pair a half size smaller and there were still large
4.0,"Lovely color, and soft fabric. Not too bad for hot weather.<br />Love the pockets, but the weight of your phone may make the side droop a little. I may stitch some twill or other ribbon to keep the side from stretching down. After wearing it for a day, the hem is a little lower than before.<br />The sleeves hit just above the elbow for a dressier look.<br />The under bust seam falls about an inch below my bust, which is an acceptable place for me.<br />The neck line gives just a peak of cleavage.<br />Also, the skirt flares lovely when you spin."
4.0,nice color consistancy
4.0,It does fit a little snug but not bad!  It is rather stretchy and my hands are not quite small.
4.0,I got so many compliments when I wore this. I would‚Äôve given it 5 stars but the inside keep me extremely itchy all night so it was a bit uncomfortable but worth it. Buying another for my bff.
4.0,Thought it was more like the blue turquoise from the pic but more like the greenish blue so doesn't match my turquoise jewelry but still very nice.
4.0,"It looks different then the picture and is a bit short in the front, but not a deal breaker. The material is comfortable. I'm had I read reviews and ordered a size up that is definitely recommend. Overall I like the dress."
4.0,This costume was as expected.  The fit was true to size and comes with all items pictured. I would recommend to anyone looking for an easy to wear kids costume.
4.0,Very cute. I got a lot of compliments on it. Can‚Äôt sit and brand new batteries ran out with a few hours of running them.
4.0,"I like this mask.  It is cut to a good size and the pattern/print is really good.<br />Only thing I would change is the bottom gaps a bit, even when tightened on the ears."
4.0,The earrings were a bit smaller than I expected but none the less they look good in my ears. They are slightly bent where the rod part that goes through your ear was soldered to the star/moon. Other than that they are great. The backings are rubbery which I like.
4.0,I'd give these 5 stars but what was supposed to be silver/shiny chrome turned out to be gun metal gray.  I love the glasses though!!! I still would recommend these to others.
4.0,Super cute!! Top was a little big but still really cute !!
4.0,"I am not very big in the top department it was a bit big on me but it is comfortable and softtt, so I will be fixing it so it fits better"
4.0,"This belt is good quality and it goes cute with black dresses,"
4.0,The product is ok I did not expect it to be so thin. Hoping to wear them has motorcycle riding pants but not so sure about it
4.0,"Very interesting material, like a thick sort of weaved material. Pretty though, feels very well made and looks great on."
4.0,So cute. I just wish the length was shorter.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter as a present, and the tail is wonderfully high quality and looks realistic, but the ear clips are difficult to style in a way where they don‚Äôt stick out. Overall good product, would recommend getting a separate pair of ears though."
4.0,"A strap is a strap, and this is a strap!"
4.0,I love this dress! It is as described! It is see-through though... But I wore a cardigan with it so it wasn't an issue.
4.0,I like the fabric of the suit but the bottom was too cheeky. I originally ordered the medium and the top fit good but the bottom was quite large. I might return and get the small though!
4.0,Hot but breaks easily
4.0,Great item and price .
4.0,I ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 130 pounds. It fit fine and is really cute.
4.0,Cute suit but it‚Äôs a little big.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and weigh about 120-125lbs, The arms were a little snug but it was fine. I was definitely not expecting it to be kinda sheer. You can definitely see the impression of my thigh high sock which is kinda sexy if thats what you‚Äôre going for LOL I later dyed/dirtied up the dress so it was spookier and of course the slight sheerness wasn‚Äôt an issue after that.<br /><br />Not sure how comfortable sleeping in this thing would be but wearing it for Halloween was definitely comfy!"
4.0,"I selected 5X for this article.  I normally would choose 2X to fit and 3X if I wanted room for jacket.  Looking at the size chart I realized that 4X would fit but for a fleece jacket, 5X ight be better.  I was correct and the size is quite good.<br /><br />I have not tested the article in the rain yet.  Should be next week.  Assembly appears good and this does have pit zips but no mesh liner.  Packing into the mesh pocket is workable."
4.0,Daughter loves them. Liked that they were both different. Only complaint is the weight. They were a bit heavy and hard to hold on the ear. But she really loves them.
4.0,"Look GREAT on my wife, size 6 petite."
4.0,Really nice pendant. Big beautiful stone. Im happy with the buy. Just wish the wire wrapping wasn't plated since it's rubbed off or turned colors or something. Other than<br />that it's a nice buy.
4.0,"For the price this is a decent dress, the top section is a bit looser than I was expecting, but I can fix this easily with my sewing machine, the bottom part is a thicker material, but not see-through. I bought the xlarge, I wear a 14-16, 38 DD , this fit perfectly in the waist."
4.0,"I like these leggings, they are very cute and the fit is great. My only issue is that they are a bit thin so if you have cellulites it shows, otherwise very nice."
4.0,"Cute and decent fit price. Just short on the lenght. Size up, so they don't fit high waters"
4.0,"I needed shoes for a beach themed wedding. I was wearing a simple navy blue lace dress, lapis jewelry, and a simple shawl. Didn't want to wear anything fancy. Found these and fell in love with them. Could not find them in a store, so ordered them from Amazon."
4.0,"I like these tanks, however I would not consider them compression tanks. They fit nice and do dry quickly. I did order a second set in a different color."
4.0,I loved this dress! It was perfect for my anniversary date. I got many compliments on it and my husband loved it ;-) I ordered a large which is my normal size and it was a bit loose so I also went and ordered a medium. That came and fit much better. Unfortunately the sewing on the plunge was off so both side weren‚Äôt even and it look weird. I ended up returning the medium and sticking with the large. It wasn‚Äôt so loose that it couldn‚Äôt be worn out.
4.0,It‚Äôs nice but runs quite small. I‚Äôm usually a small and petite person but the small was smaller than expected. Had to kinda squeeze myself in. Size up if you‚Äôre interested
4.0,"I didn't realize the material when I ordered this. It's not cotton- it's like shiny swimsuit nylon. The cut and shape are good, and the size is as expected. Love the pockets. Just wish I'd paid attention to the material."
4.0,"The price was reasonable and the design is simple, but it was what I was looking for."
4.0,"Being a 2X I expected a snugger fit.  The fabric is very thin and quite sheer, which I don't mind but a cami is required underneath.  It appears well made.  My only real complaint would be that the model must be about 4'11&#34; because the shirt actually falls at just below the length you see where her fingertips are.  Still it's very nice for the price.  I wish these Chinese sellers would get it that there's big girls in the US who love the oversize look of their products and wouldn't mind paying a little more in order to get them in our size.  Sigh."
4.0,"I bought this for my best friends birthday because we both love the Percy Jackson series. It arrived looking just like the picture and I'm thinking that it'll last a pretty good amount of time. The only thing is that the leather chain is a bit shorter than I expected, but I'm sure she wont mind. I could also tell that whoever was shipping this cared in the safety of their product because it was wrapped well and a few layers. In the end I'd call this buy a win and I'm sure so will my friend."
4.0,"This is a nice sweater dress. It's got an attached hoodie, which makes it cute. My sweater dress is black, so it goes with many of my leggings. It's a dress, so you could probably wear it without leggings, but I'm more comfortable with leggings.<br />It's a bit shapeless, which is probably why it's called ""Loose Sweater Dress"" but the style is still there.<br />It's wool and cashmere blended, so it needs to be hand-washed; I use the gentle cycle on my washing machine and lay it flat to dry.<br />Very pretty!"
4.0,"I wanted a ""thank you"" charm for someone who was a great help at a time of need.  Your charm fit the bill!"
4.0,Cute necklace for my 14-yr-old daughter.  Perfect length.
4.0,They're very nice comfortable fit the only thing I don't like is the padding but I'm getting used to that
4.0,Nice summer flip flop for my son.  He says the arch support isn't as prominent as he'd like - but it's still a nice shoe.
4.0,"Absolutely adorable!  It‚Äôs so cute and fits well.  I failed to notice the cat on the back of the shirt, but such a sweet touch.  The material is a bit thinner than I had hoped, but just means I won‚Äôt be wearing this until even light sweaters aren‚Äôt needed."
4.0,"These scarves worked well.  I have to wear masks at work when not in my office and these are a nice option.  Can easily take the mask part down and it looks like a scarf, then put back up when walking leaving the office."
4.0,Love it!  Snug fit but worth it.
4.0,Nice sweater. Sized up one size and fits perfectly
4.0,It‚Äôs very well made. Would use brand again.
4.0,"Nice large pretty tote bag. Purchased October 2015 and I have not carried the tote yet, that's why 4 stars as opposed to 5.  It's a good looking bag, but I have to carry it around a bit.  Will update.  The color is definitely fushia, not red. Has that great smell of leather and the bag is large enough for my necessities and the bag is not heavy while empty.  Would recommend. I purchased 2 &#34;red&#34; bags, one small, one large.  I kept the larger of the two bags. Smaller bag had the shoulder strap, large tote did not have shoulder strap.  Both seem like great bags."
4.0,I liked the material and the sturdy zipper! I use it as a robe and also a swimsuit cover up.
4.0,They fit very well.  I did get a mix of socks.  Some 0-6 months and some 6-12 months.  Fortunately I need both.
4.0,"I gave it four stars because it is really nice, however; the photo on-line looked like an olive color.  When I received it, it was grey.  So I had to return it, because I wanted the olive colored one."
4.0,"I purchased two pairs of the Baleaf capris before I purchased these. I love the capris, so I knew I'd love these. When I got them, I was shocked at how long these are! I stand at 5'6"" tall and I had to have my mother-in-law hem these another 3 inches. (For reference, I ordered an XXL) I still love them, and she did a great job! The pocket on the waistband fits my iPhone XR (with case) nicely. These will be my go-to pants when it comes to walking/running errands in the colder months!"
4.0,"So far my son and I really enjoy this rain suit. He is 15 months and still wears nine month size clothes comfortably. His height and weight are on par for his age. I ordered the 18-24 month size so that he will have it for some time.<br />Pros:<br />-I bought the item from Hatley because they are eco-friendly<br />-The brim on the hood keeps water from the face<br />-Unless the child is sitting in puddles rain stays out of the suit (I note from experience)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The second time I put the suit on my son, one of the buttons for the shoe strap came off. The thread wasn't sewn in it well.<br /><br />-It is lined very nicely so if you live in the South like we do, maybe opt for a lighter lined  suit if your child sweats.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend and buy this again!"
4.0,Product is very well made and I like the fit
4.0,Great product very sturdy.
4.0,"Love the style. Glass is clear and magnification perfect. Only complaint is that they are loose on my head, and I have a big head. But I love them regardless."
4.0,"I love this sweatshirt but can't bring myself to give it the 5 stars because the design is on the back of the sweatshirt. ( I originally thought it was on front)<br /><br />It is such a beautiful design, the colors are bright and the details are great.  I get complements all the time when people are behind me.<br /><br />Would be a five star if the design was on the front where I can enjoy it more myself."
4.0,"This purse works perfectly for my 8 year old granddaughter. Fits well, not too long for her. Took away one star because the description made me think it was real leather. It is not. But for a child, that is not a problem."
4.0,I love the color and the material. The pants are somewhat snug.
4.0,MY daughter will love this charm. She is a soccer freak......The writing is large enough to read and the heart is nice and bright and big to see it.
4.0,"Nice simple watch. Light works ok, not the greatest. My only real complaint is that I need a longer watch band because of my large wrists. I still recommend ."
4.0,I haven't had a new purse in years and this one was just a perfect fit for my needs!
4.0,I have other Nike training XL shorts and they fit just right! These new ones run smaller.
4.0,"Awesome! Every plug is the same size and the stones are beautiful. Only negative is that the white ones did not have a similar pattern, one is pretty much blank and the other had lines throughout"
4.0,Loved this wig. It was very pretty & looked great!
4.0,Really good and pretty watch... I gave it 4 stars because of the band it is a bit stiff but other than that I liked it
4.0,"I really like this shirt and it is a quality shirt. It does run small. I ordered a large for my husband and it fits more like a medium. I meant to return it, but decided to keep it for myself. It is also a somewhat athletic fit."
4.0,I‚Äôm a large busted individual. While these provide somewhat more support than the sports bras that just smoosh; they would not work for a high-intensity workout. However they are comfortable and I appreciate that the extra padding is removeable.
4.0,"Gorgeous color! Unfortunately, it runs oddly short."
4.0,"I liked the style of this dress quite a bit. The design is as pictured. As are the colors of the sequens. I didn't notice any missing. The dress seems well made. Also comfortable on... Not scratchy anywhere.<br /><br />The straps are not adjustable and they were a bit long on me. Overall it was too big for me. I'm about 5'3"" and 110 lbs. It fit very baggy and swallowed me."
4.0,"The fit is kind of off, so you have to adjust"
4.0,I liked this very much.it was just to small in the cup.And I could not get a larger cup size.
4.0,My son loved it and was excited when he opened the package.
4.0,"Bought these for a mid-January visit to Stockholm, Sweden where I knew it would be snowing for a few days, followed by slush due to the snow.<br />Having read many of the reviews, I was worried that the quality might be hit-or-miss. My pair is/was fine.<br />I wore these an entire week in just-at-freezing weather with a pair of SmartWool socks. They have enough room that If I had wanted to wear a second pair of socks, I could, but I also didn't feel they were too loose with the single pair that I wore.<br />My feet were plenty warm, and always dry.<br />I can't predict how long these will last; at $50 I don't expect them to last forever, but for a week-long visit to a snow-covered city, they worked out just fine with good traction, and overall fairly light for a shoe that is basically a rain & snow boot.<br />I hope to use them for weekend visits to the snow on occasion, now that the reason I bought them have allowed them to pay for themselves."
4.0,"I've looked all over for round,short boot/high-top sneaker length elastic (not plastic).  These were some of the only ones I could find for anything close to a reasonable price.  I ordered brown and black to be used with short work boots that are worn mostly for at school and need to be taken on and off quickly.  I was torn between giving 3 stars or 4 stars and went with 4 because the laces look nice, are round and stretchy.  My concern is that when they are used in shoes that have metal rings that are not completely smooth or that have the hook-and-eye type of lacing (like in work boots, hiking boots, etc.) the laces are going to &#34;saw&#34; against the metal and get cut to ribbons.  If you are gentle with these they probably will last for a while, but if you have to constantly stretch the shoe against the laces they might not last all that long. I had no other options, so I'm giving these a try and hoping for the best."
4.0,Nicly polished !
4.0,Very nice just the snap is too big for my item and doesnt fit
4.0,I love this little mermaid contact case. It is well made and sturdy. I‚Äôve dropped the lid in the floor several times certain I‚Äôd chipped the shell or broke off the tail. But it‚Äôs still going strong.
4.0,Very good for the price tag.
4.0,"I bought this after I took my industrial bar out, for the lower hole. It fits great and doesn‚Äôt hurt to sleep on. I do wish the bar was a little longer, I struggled to get the ball screwed on."
4.0,This product was well made really nice fabric just wasn‚Äôt my style after I tried it on.
4.0,Don't get the to large comments.
4.0,Thin material that clings to every surface. Sizes are accurate.  Great summer dress or layer w/thermal layer. Must have a slip under.
4.0,I wear a lot of clothes.  I wear a lot of clothes intended to make me seem clever and witty.  I've worn this shirt twice and have gotten about 12 comments.  That's a big win for a hipster doofus.
4.0,Cute I size down a little bit because I don‚Äôt like baggy clothes but it‚Äôs very cute and was better quality than I had anticipated
4.0,should be more multi colors
4.0,Cute bag and plenty of room for a large phone and other items.  Received lots of compliments.  Some small beads came off in the package; otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
4.0,It‚Äôs an ok t shirt
4.0,"My teenager is a big Marvelhead, he loved them!"
4.0,It is well put together.  Very nice looking.  Kind of heavy.
4.0,"Soft material, not really sturdy, no compression, and slightly see through but I love the color and fit"
4.0,The grandchild liked them. Maybe they will still have them when summer comes.
4.0,Daughter loved in her Easter basket!
4.0,"I was looking for a nice replacement for my 10 year old case that wasn't too large and had a fun pattern. This met my needs. If the hinge holds up for a while, I would update to 5 stars."
4.0,"Mine says 67.2% cashmere. They're really soft, and keep my hands warm enough at work that I'm not freezing. I took off one star because they are a little on the tight side, but I have larger than average hands for a woman. Still love them and will buy more in different colors."
4.0,"I ordered the white dress. Note that the straps are not adjustable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 height, 32 bust, 26/27 waist. And this dress in size small fit me exactly. Straps were also an exact fit, So if you are taller or have a longer upper body, take this sizing into consideration. The dress is good for the price you pay. White is only a bit sheer so wear nude undergarments"
4.0,"I have gotten several compliments on this shirt. It's comfortable and the fabric doesn't seem like it's going to do the usual thing womens tops do, where the fabric balls up.  I am pretty happy with my purchase."
4.0,They're great except for the side you can't see in the picture where the teal color at the waist goes down the right leg.
4.0,"The pearls arrived as promised. I didn't get the certificate of authenticity, is it possible to still get the certificate? I would like to get it as shown in the Amazon page."
4.0,"The watch looks awesome and is cheap, so it‚Äôs easy to replace if you lose it. Setting alarms will require reading the manual. My only real complaint is that the back light is very dim to the point of being useless, so if you‚Äôre looking for a strong backlight I‚Äôd recommend a different Casio watch with a better backlight."
4.0,"It says one size fits all, but it needs more holes. If you are between sizes, like my son, then I had to make another hole in the band."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and ordered a large. Fit perfectly! The mask it comes with sucks so I‚Äôd recommend getting another.
4.0,"The color is very nice, and it fit very well, I would buy it in another color. Good value for the money."
4.0,"I like the quality of it, but it does run a little large. Wish I had gotten a smaller size"
4.0,"this is a nice boho anklet. The oxidized silver looks great and the charms are nice. It has the look of handmade, which is always a nice touch. I also like the lobster hook closure."
4.0,A little large but I am 140Lbs and only 5'4&#34; so I like things slightly larger.  I am going to check out the medium IT'S AMAZINGLY FLATTERING SEXY FOR THE PRICE. My boyfriend loved it!
4.0,I like these rings and think they are a good deal and also very beautiful. BUT they are very small. They don‚Äôt tell you how small they are and they all hang very very closely to my nose except for the two bedazzled clickers. The horseshoe ones are all very small and are hardly visible outside of my nostrils. Still cute so if you like small nose rings these are for you
4.0,It‚Äôs ok looking! It‚Äôs durable! Fits true to size!
4.0,"It's cute! However, it is see through, and the sash does not look like it is pictured."
4.0,It's a nice fabric and cute.  The cut on the hips area is a little different.  I ordered based on the size chart from the seller and it is too large (that's why the 4 stars).  Be sure to order your actual size.
4.0,More flattering than I thought they would be. They are thinner and a bit more sheer than they look in the pictures so be mindful of that. Other than that they feel nice.
4.0,The design is awesome.....Quality is not great......small and difficult to place post in ear lobe
4.0,Comfortable but they run very small. Order a size or even two sizes up. Wish I didnt take the tags off because I would have exchanged them.
4.0,it does what i needed it to
4.0,"I like the colorful print of this dress and the summery style. The problem is that the fabric is very thin and kind of cheap looking. It has just the tiniest hint of stretch. You can pretty much see through it in bright light. The fit runs small. I would have sized up had I read the fabric details. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 162lbs and a 34G bra size. The X-large would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."
4.0,Haven‚Äôt used it yes is why I gave 4 star but it looks good!
4.0,"I love them!! I lost a pair similar like that, but these will do!!"
4.0,The color is perfect and they came in beautiful packaging but they aren't put together that well the clasp on all 3 pairs are crooked where they are attached to the hoop. you don't notice that much wearing them but I guess for the price its fine.
4.0,I usually wear a medium but since I‚Äôm a growing pregnant woman I order a xl and fits somewhat smaller it doesn‚Äôt seem like a xl
4.0,Not expensive but cute
4.0,Im usually a small there is no xs but this is very stretchy so a bit big
4.0,"Quite long and boxy--looks like it could be worn with leggings. Also super thin material, but my teen likes it."
4.0,I bought this for a wedding but the fabric is a bit heavy for warmer weather and I did not think the neckline looked flattering on me
4.0,It would of looked better if I‚Äôd have gotten a smaller size. I‚Äôm 140 and got a lg should of gotten a sm
4.0,The chain is way too thin. It broke then1st day she wore it. The feather is adorable and will be put on a thicker chain.
4.0,Used for hallloween not really something I‚Äôd wear on another day but worked great as a costume.  Good quality washed easily.
4.0,"Lovely watch for the price. However, I started to have an allergic response to the metal whenever my wrist gets a little sweaty. It‚Äôs stainless steel but likely has some nickel content which I have an allergy to. So this watch is less functional now that I have to remove it a lot.  Looking for another option."
4.0,"This band isn't made out of the best materials but it looks good.  Came with a whole kit to adjust the beans including a mount, happier and punch. I've only knocked it one star for one reason it doesn't have any fine adjustment like you find on more expensive brands. I find that this leaves me in between to tight and uncomfortable and to loose and sliding up and down my wrist but an unbeatable value for two good brands, universal adjustment kit and screen protector."
4.0,The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because my very big oversized glasses do not fit in this case. I would like to have a bigger case for my oversized glasses and haven't had any luck finding one. This one works well and is beautiful for my smaller glasses.
4.0,Good size. Fold into small zippered pouch. Easily fit in my purse. Only complaint is that it is a tight fit to get bag in pouch. Takes a minute to do.
4.0,"Cute, but they don't stay cuffed to my earlobes. One or both usually end up slipping."
4.0,Very comfortable and nice material.  Flattering for postpartum belly and arms.
4.0,"Love this shirt.  Nice and comfortable.  Great for work! A little longer at the back than I expected but I loved it none the less!!! Yes the fabric is see through but I realized that before I ordered. As for size mine was a little big. I ordered a small and had to get it altered. I'm 5'4&#34; and 113 lbs. I'm a 34C, just for reference."
4.0,It is true to size. The material is nice. It is made nice. Love the red color.
4.0,"This floral shirt is made with a very comfortable tee shirt type fabric. It does seems to run big but is less noticeable with the sleeves rolled up. I machine washed then did about 15 minutes in the dryer before hanging to finish dry. Very easy care! The pleats in the front seemed to  ""add weight"", but that was mostly the way I was standing in the picture. It does add some visual weight, but nothing more than I would expect with this type of shirt. One thing about the fit is that it flares out at the bottom more than I have the hips for. I think an extra small or a petite size could help with that. I get that this is a personal fit issue for me, but it may be helpful to the other petite ladies out there.<br />All in all, I would still recommend this top because of the comfortable fabric and easy care."
4.0,Looks a little cheap but still really cute! Skip the belt and it's much better!
4.0,"I just got this backpack on Saturday. The laptop pocket fits my 15.6&#34; ASUS laptop!! It just makes it though. There's another TWO pockets that can fit even more stuff. I'm a nursing student and my Med-Surg book fit into this bag EASILY. I was honestly shocked. I also had even more stuff in my bag as well. There's a front pocket that's also great for putting pens, markers, etc. Overall I think this is a great bag however I only bumped it down one star because the bottom of the bag is kinda thin so we'll see how long it lasts.  Also, I'd like to add that it feels really comfortable even though I have so much stuff inside of it. I'd purchase this bag but probably not for this price though. Up to you."
4.0,I am  5'9&#34; in and I sized up two sizes the jumper fit but it's high waters so I rate the product for stars because my seamstress is going to make it into gauchos.
4.0,"All the straps fit well. The only issue I had was with the part that holds your boobs. It was a bit too low and it continually gives me uni-boob if I wear it by itself. If I wear a bra under it it works okay but it doesn't fit quite right over the bra, and I don't wear padded cups."
4.0,I usually wear medium but thought that large would be best in this fitted shirt. Wound up having to return it for an XL.
4.0,I like the shoes but should have gone up 1/2 a size.they are a little too tight.nice shoe for the money.
4.0,I am giving a 4 because it runs small.
4.0,"Every, every time I wear this people compliment me.  Then they reach out and touch it and comment on how soft it is.  I think I will order a couple more in different colors.  I wear it as a sweater in mild weather and over my coat in cooler weather it is a great piece to own."
4.0,Do a good job of keeping cold and wind out of my eye when I am riding my electric scooter.  I do have to wear these over glasses and there is just enough room to do so.
4.0,"Looks nice but i have,t used them i like it"
4.0,"Very pretty! They are exactly as described, but they are much heavier feeling than I expected."
4.0,"These shirts fit great and are super comfortable. I love them and will buy them again. The only problem is one of them has already torn, I have had these for less than a month."
4.0,Im 5'8 and the length is perfect.  Color is smaller than pictured but the fit is good.
4.0,"Feels so secure, Perfect for a septum üå∏"
4.0,"The Lingswallow Women's Cute Funny Cartoon Print socks fit well, though the fuzzy interiors mean you need to roll them down, put your toes in then roll them back up. They are light enough to keep my feet warm in the spring and summer months."
4.0,Runs on the small side.. Not the best pick for large chests. But the fabric has a nice structure.
4.0,Beautiful boots! They look expensive and are a great deal! But definitely run small. I have other Vince camjto shoes and they are all 6.5 but these I had to go up to a 7 and I have small narrow feet. The calf is also small which is good for me.
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute dress and looks nice when on the body but should‚Äôve gotten a size smaller. A medium was too loose and big that it didn‚Äôt look flattering. Was going to get the small but because I‚Äôm currently pregnant went a size up and it was too loose.<br /><br />Pregnant mamas get your usual size the dress atreches enough to fit around your belly.
4.0,Overall it fits well and looks fine. The material feels slightly lower quality than I was expecting but not bad.
4.0,It‚Äôs not a bad toy.  Just keep an eye on the pin & chain. They break off easy.  Day it arrived in mail it broke off.  But it still works with sound & lights.
4.0,"Super cute shirt, but it was very see through in the peach color."
4.0,"I received this product at a discounted price for a fair and honest review.<br /><br />I think this shirt is really cute and seems to be high quality.  I was hoping it would be a little more flow-y, but it runs small."
4.0,Super soft fabric. Colors are more bold than shown in pic. Cute as keeping it still!
4.0,wrong link to short
4.0,"Material was nice and they were very cute. They run small, Iwould order a large if you wear a medium"
4.0,Purchased for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to really enjoy them.
4.0,"nice ring, but not what I expected.  It's thin."
4.0,This bra was perfect under my see-through shirt. The fit was spot on and the detail was very nice.
4.0,"Thought it would be cotton, but more jersey so that was disappointing, but still like item."
4.0,Very nice sentimental pick for the kid's uncle. He loved it.
4.0,It definitely is not meant for big boobs sadly too small but that‚Äôs okay the outfit is still what I expected
4.0,Nice and very spacious.
4.0,Pretty hat but had to return.  Too small
4.0,"The fabric is a little thin, but otherwise fine and the delivery was fast (wouldn't want to hold that sneeze forever!"
4.0,I should have order a smaller size.  I can always make it smaller but not larger. üòâüòâ
4.0,great idea I am making collar stays like crazy
4.0,"This dress is great quality, beautiful & sexy BUT it is short. It fit great everywhere else but its short. its still really cute so ill keep it for a date night with my BF."
4.0,Warm and light weight. Very soft outer. Has a tendency to pill in wear areas.
4.0,"This was for my daughter, her favorite color is purple and I wanted something cute and warm for the winter for her. This arrived in hot pink with NO decals on it. Very disappointed. I did return this item. Amazon of course couldn't guarantee that I would get the correct item with a replacement, so I just got a refund."
4.0,"I was delivered on time, I do like the way it fits on my child. And great looking too."
4.0,My Captain America loved these!
4.0,it was nice would be perfect summer pjs it is however very thin and somewhat see through in the back
4.0,Not my grandmothers home made quilt but good for the price. I use them as furniture covers as I have dogs. Minimal padding so easy to machine wash. Material is softer than on some others I have bought in the past.
4.0,Many funny memories if used correctly.
4.0,"This mask is definitely very unique and has really great realistic looking details. Came packaged well. It is made of thick resin, so you do have to be careful with it. One drop on the ground and it will break. It is quite heavy, so it's not very comfortable to wear for long periods. It can leave jabs and bruises on your nose from the weight. I would recommend putting cotton or felt inside the nose piece to give some cushion. Unfortunately the mask did shatter into pieces on the tile floor, so again be very careful with it. Probably not a mask for kids."
4.0,The it was as expected because the product description of the size for the slippers were in between sizes.
4.0,A little tight but I have a big head. Otherwise awesome product
4.0,"Lightweight but very handy on account as one had carry one or store one with ease on account of their rolled up size and then unfold without much by way of crease marks. Provides a thin layer of warmth, not a huge insulator. On the smaller size hence 4 stars"
4.0,"Costume was great, very well made, loved the zipper in the back, so much better than Velcro. Lightweight, but warm enough for trick or treating. Only complaint the wig was a little hard getting on my daughter!"
4.0,"I love these watch bands. The solo bands without being adjustable just don‚Äôt fit right. I‚Äôm a nurse and these are perfect for my Iwatch. They make the watch easy to move up and down my arm when washing my hands, but also keep the watch in the perfect place on my arm. Unfortunately, I got one stuck to some Velcro and it really tore up the fuzzy material. It‚Äôs extra fuzzy now so be careful."
4.0,I like the fit.  Used for recreation
4.0,"First pair:<br />I like these. but they do let light in a little around the bridge of the nose if they aren't pushed all the way down in a day lit room.  They are comfortable and don't come in contact with the eyes at all.<br /><br />My second pair:<br />I've tried a couple of other brands, and I think these are the best I've tried to date.  These are my second pair of eyesnugs.  Eventually the inner fabric will start to peel away, but that takes many months to happen, and their cheap enough to just buy a new pair.  They don't make contact with the eyes, and they are comfortable.  I think a sleep mask imparts a deeper sleep if you have a bedroom that is not pitch black.  It's important to sleep in complete darkness."
4.0,"Ordered a size up based (am a L, got a XL) on reviews and the dress fits great! However, if I had any bigger breasts than a B cup I doubt the top part would be comfortable. As it is, it‚Äôs kind of snug up top. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 180lbs and the dress hits right at my knees. The fabric is a nice stretchy polyester up top and a thicker, cotton like fabric for the bottom half. IT IS NOT SEE THROUGH. The pattern is gorgeous and I had several compliments while wearing it."
4.0,"I ordered my regular size xl and it was still a little baggy..if u want more of a baggy look, order a size up..i have love handles ..but this romper sorta hides it. its light and breathable material.. will order another color .i'm 5'4 200lbs"
4.0,I really liked the colors but the mask was too big and would not stay up.  I had to return it.
4.0,"Love the look. Love the flowing fabric, but should have went a size larger as it was too tight in the bust area. But it is cute and love how the straps are adjustable. Too bad they don't have it in my size."
4.0,"I like them, I can read with them."
4.0,"My only problem it‚Äôs too large rather than that it‚Äôs perfect<br />And good material... I had to return it ., hope there‚Äôs a smaller size"
4.0,"Great casual shorts to wear out and about, or over a swimsuit (like I did). They're a little on the small size, but, not too small that I can't wear them. I would size up my next pair. Overall, great purchase!"
4.0,"Looks great, nice comfortable fit. Only gave 4 stars because it doesn't fully block the sun out. Sun comes in under the side bottom. Which isn't terrible."
4.0,"Took time to arrive and was package in individual plastic bag pockets. The colors are nice only wish that they were more options than 4, reason for 4 stars vs 5. Cute ribbons for girls under ten. Bought this as party favors for my daughters birthday. I like that the ribbon is great for those allergic to metals. If your daughter likes necklaces, this is fun to have. My daughter wears the choker except when taking showers or swimming."
4.0,Not crazy over the colors. Love the way they fit
4.0,Beautiful bag. Well made. But the bag it's self is pretty heavy.
4.0,"I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my dad. It's a little smaller than I anticipated but the lure was well made, engraving looked great and the hook is definitely sharp! I would recommend this gift for the fisherman in your life!"
4.0,Too small. I ordered a large but even those was squeezing my boobs into one big fat lump. Nothing wrong with the bras themselves but the size chart isn‚Äôt really accurate.
4.0,"exactly what I was looking for, very nice"
4.0,"The materials are nice and soft and shrink just a tiny bit after washing, but they are a bit loose for my daughter, who is 2 years old. She has a small booty for her age I guess, lol."
4.0,The product arrived on time.  It's  nice for the price.  Will order from this vendor again.  Thank you!!
4.0,Buy one size larger as they shrink quite a bit.
4.0,"Kind of lighter weight than I expected but, I guess that's a good thing so, overall pretty good."
4.0,"These yoga leggings are super comfy and cute. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and I bought a large and they fit me as high waist and go past my calves. They seem to hold up well after washing too. The only complaint I have is that they can be a little sheer around the butt, but I usually wear longer shirts to work out so it doesn‚Äôt really bother me much. Overall I really like these pants"
4.0,"Really liked this too. It stretches and it is good material. However, the puff on the sleeves were too loose and they kept falling off of me"
4.0,Love the shirt. :)
4.0,My husband says that it works great on his hats.
4.0,"These gloves are picture perfect, but they are cut to fit large people. I am 110 lbs. They were way too large!"
4.0,"What a great dress!  The only thing I would say is that the fabric is really stiff.  I am hoping some fabric softner might work, but really that is the only thing I can find to take a star off for.  If you follow the size chart it will fit exactly as you expect it.  Glad I took a chance, and for the price it is going for it will be perfect for summer time events!"
4.0,Cute! Love the size! Bend easy though so if your taking a N95 on and off they may tangle. Bend right back though.
4.0,I gave it to my daughter as a gift. Beautiful stone.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ba238e58ed3a50da3a938c42832c5b9]] Okay, so I got the medium and immediately returned it because it was HUGE - I ordered the small because despite this dress being TOO big on me it is really of great quality - the fabric is beautiful, thick (but NOT heavy), a deep WINE (not red despite what it looks like on the video), Watch my video for more details. But basically, I am drawn to this dress and will probably keep it because it has a really cool medieval and or peasant feel (bohemian) to it.  I love the cut out shoulders, I have a few tops like this and think it is SO sexy!  I also love that the dress is SO comfortable and it drapes really nicely.  I love that it has deep pockets and that it is long.  It is also a great price!!<br />Cons - I only list a few because there are so many pros!<br />1. They need to make an extra small - come on - I am 5'4 and 110 lbs with a pear shape - and when I say 110? It's NOT muscle (unfortunately) so there are plenty of women out there WAY smaller than me that would never fit this dress yet? It's  REALLY beautiful dress that could be worn by petite women - MAKE an extra small!<br />2. REthink the pockets - while I like pockets...do NOT put them nea women's thighs - okay, that may sound weird but what I mean is - don't make women who already may be wider in that area - LOOK wider - place the pockets HIGHER up - as in more near the front of the dress NOT the sides of the dress.<br /><br />That's it.  This dress is really beautiful - I think, if you're frame is small? Wear a belt with it or a tight jacket - if you're taller and wider? Rock this dress! It will complement a woman that is taller/wider and has more of a V frame. If you're more of a pear like me? Get a cute cinch belt (see pictures/video) that will balance you out."
4.0,Cheap beater watch. Only thing wrong is the illumination is nearly worthless.
4.0,"They were smaller than I anticipated, but otherwise they work."
4.0,Nice and warm for my Mother-in-law. This is the second one I purchased. Great value.
4.0,"Looks good, fits nicely and very figure flattering. Not exact to color shown but I REALLY like it. üòä I am 5'7&#34; 230 and ordered 2X. Perfect fit on me"
4.0,A good bag with a lot of storage areas. I use it for everyday work in the city and travel. The straps are thin but seem to be holding up with all the weight I carry.
4.0,My 7 year old child just fits size 130.  US size 10/12 typically.  The shirt and pants are cute and soft.  The head piece looks good in person but just barely closes under the chin.  The fingers on the gloves are not furry they look good.  Overall we're happy with the costume.
4.0,The top is made for a very small busted woman.  Very cute and on a thin athletic build it would look adorable.
4.0,"I will have to cinch the back stretchy part a bit to make it fit. Otherwise, it fits nicely and covers my chest (which has a lot of area to cover!) The back is loose and falls away. Only the scrunchy part is loose, which is kind of annoying, but it's a $30 dress."
4.0,These definitely are sports bras! They offer a lot of support. I personally took out the inserts and still have plenty of support!
4.0,The pocket squares look nice and is a good starting point when collecting and expanding your wardrobe.
4.0,Nice bag for the price. Love the two tone colors which wasn‚Äôt described in the listing. Leather is a little stiff but a great accessory to have if you don‚Äôt want to carry a lot of items. A little disappointed with the communication with the seller. Had asked two questions and didn‚Äôt receive a reply.
4.0,These cycling glasses work great. I love the coverage on the face. I also like the fact that they are clear for late evening and night riding so that bugs do not get into your eyes. But the only problem that I have is the smell that the glasses and case give off.
4.0,Fit well and looked cute for a last minute Chinese New Year outfit.
4.0,"The band is well made, however I can only get it to really stay on my stomach below the ribs and well above my hips, as the elastic band slips around and won't stay on anywhere that has a curve. It seems to work best when I'm sitting still, so active use is not ideal for movement of the band, but overall I like the product."
4.0,Medal great what I wanted. Chain is Very SHORT and Very CHEAP.
4.0,Gorgeous color. Perfect length. Bouncy and fun!
4.0,Ok quality.  Pretty good.
4.0,"I love Disney and Up! I was a little disappointed with the writing not being as clear as I would like. Somewhat heavy, but adds a touch of Disney without being too obvious. It came in a nice jewelry bag and really heavy duty/big metal ring"
4.0,"The color was exactly as pictured, a nice cherry red with no orange undertone. It fit true to size and the shaft fit well also. However, I have a very narrow foot and it looked good on just standing but when I walked it would bulge out on both sides around the arch area. It didn‚Äôt look that great so I will be returning them. If you have a wider foot it should be fine. I like the boot and feel it is a great product for the price."
4.0,Very pretty ring for a good price.
4.0,"No complaints about quality or price. To borrow another buyers words, more gun metal color."
4.0,"Runs small fyi xlarge is more like medium, cute shirt though"
4.0,Strap on bracelet broke
4.0,"I really like it, it fits well, but the shoulders are poofier than in the picture and the bow sits more on your bust than above it. If you have a smaller chest it would probably be okay, but on a girl like me it looks awfully Christmassy. I wear it around Christmas. Also, the ribbon from the bow extends down to the waist and not just like 4 inches like in the photo."
4.0,Needed a thicker fabric and bolder colors
4.0,Runs small. Nice material but I cannot tell people what size to buy
4.0,The ‚Äúbuckle‚Äù wasn‚Äôt well designed at all!  Otherwise my daughter loves them.
4.0,slim and comfortable
4.0,Nice but a little larger than appears on website
4.0,"Rec'd quickly, quality is OK. However, they are quite wrinkled after coming out of the dryer, which I wouldn't expect. Probably would not purchase again."
4.0,"I was dubious about spending so little on a cycling jersey set, mainly in regards to sizing. While I read that it was true to size and to order your regular size, I opted to go up one size (my experience with cheaper made clothing usually means made in Asia where sizing is vastly different). I usually wear an XL, but bought the XXL. I'm glad I did. It fits well with the exception of the sleeves being slightly too long. As far as the quality goes, it seems to be fine. We'll see after it's been washed a few times."
4.0,"RUNS TOO SMALL, GET A 2 SIZES UP."
4.0,Everything is perfect except the roses are very cheaply made
4.0,like the style and quality
4.0,These sweatpants are well worth the money. Well made! Am very happy with this purchase and plan on buying more. I still need to wash them so not sure about shrinkage. They are long for me so will get them hemmed. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù.
4.0,"The tank is pretty and love it. However, I read the comments and ordered one size larger than my normal size and it was still too small. It was extremely tight around the neck and chest. I ordered two sizes larger and it fits like my normal size. Too small is an understatement - but if you order accordingly per the feedback it's a great blouse."
4.0,"Bought these for my 3 year old and they were a bit too wide & (he has a big head), but they work for my 8 year old. cool looking, Sturdy and nicely made for the price."
4.0,Cute suit.  Ran small.
4.0,I love these bracelets. They aren't for everyday wear but will accommodate any outfit.
4.0,"I ordered based on the size chart and other reviewers and the arms of this dress are still a little tight. It's very flowy and has a nice shape to it, looks flattering on, but I haven't worn it yet because it's too tight in the arms."
4.0,"The kid did not want to wear the show covers. Worn for 2 nights of Halloween events. Trick or treat and a Halloween festival that included running around, a bounce house, something black and sticky on the knees but costume survived the most rugged child of 4 :)"
4.0,"Daughter wears at US 1.  I was sent originally a a European 32...way too large.  I ordered a US size 13 and then received a 31.  I ordered a US size 12 and then received a size 29....a little snug but able to wear this year.  For my other daughter, I ordered a size 2.5 and received a size 34..... fit perfectly.  REALLY wish I could have ordered in European sizes to begin with...but the design is DARLING and both girls get compliments all the time!  Will order my younger the next size up once she outgrows the current size."
4.0,Nice material. Soft. Medium hold
4.0,Soft material that holds my hair in place during the night of sleeping. The elastic could have been better.  It is already stretching loosely.
4.0,"Its a very thick and light weight purse,Inside the purse is very deep which i love.I wish the strap was a bit longer and that i didnt have to wrestle with purse when trying to close it at times."
4.0,I want to start by saying this bikini is adorable. It fit great and was comfortable. It's the kind of bathing suit if you're not looking to be doing much other than looking cute. I like to body surf and get roudy. I have a large chest and when I was body surfing at the beautiful beach in St. Augustine everyone looking got a free show. I will definitely wear this piece again but not when I need to stay covered. I bought an XL.
4.0,"Very cute coat. Got in two different comors for my daughters. It fits well. There is a cinching at the waist that makes it look fitted ans not crazy poufy. The zipper was a little tight:hard to zip, though; however it also has snaps. The fur hood is an attachment that you button on that was difficult to figure out how to do properly without it looking a bit strange. The fur is not too ample/thick, but it looks and feels like real fur and is very soft."
4.0,For girls haha not a guy living in northern Montana haha for girls or ‚Äúgirls‚Äù guys get the black version
4.0,Very soft!!!! I got a M because of reading the reviews if you like things baggy go up a size. I wish I would have gone with the small I think oversized makes you look bigger. But it‚Äôs great for lounging around the house!:) will buy again but in a small. I‚Äôm 133lbs and 5‚Äô4
4.0,"I have been looking for this for quite some time, Hot Topic sells them for $10 which I was not about to pay so I'm glad I found it much cheaper on here. I like it, it just sucks clasping the top part to your lobe, you need to do it really tight for it to stay which somewhat hurts and I'm still worried about it sliding down. I would recommend it anyways though, my friends liked it."
4.0,"When I first ordered this dress I was a little bummed that it only went down to a size small. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô tall and weigh a mere 95 pounds usually. I decided to give the small a try anyways, and to no surprise it was too big. I was bummed but hung it in the closet anyways. Fast forward a couple months and now I‚Äôm 27 weeks pregnant and this dress is PERFECT. I saw it hanging in the closet and had nothing else that fit so decided to give it another go. I‚Äôve since bought two other color ways in the same dress because I‚Äôm now practically living in it. It‚Äôs still not too tight on my belly, the material is soft and comfortable AND it has pockets. If you‚Äôre a petite woman like me and find it hard to find maternity wear- this dress is like magic!"
4.0,"so far so good only had it for a few weeks the last one i bought that had clips like this broke on the seams which is why i had to buy this one, hopefully this one lasts longer than a few weeks."
4.0,"Flattering, comfortable, and great with leggings! Im 5ft 4in and weight 175 I usually wear an XL or 1X i ordered UP a size 2X."
4.0,"I went for this slim metal band for a dressier look than my sport wrap band. This is decently made, has a good magnet but is just a little bit too long to fit snuggly on my narrow wrist."
4.0,Very simple that is exactly what I wanted .
4.0,Cute top though there were quite a few loose strings coming off of the tunic.
4.0,These are thin
4.0,I purchase these hoping they would hold up the girls without squishing them too much similar to other sport style bras. They definitely do hold up the girls and also gives a little push up bra effect. It‚Äôs pretty comfortable and fits nicely. I‚Äôve worn and washed them a few times already and the elasticity is just as day one. Good product at a good price.
4.0,"These are extremely cute, cozy and warm! But....I have a big cuboose, and that means you can see my underwear through these. So I can still wear these with a longer outfit but nothing too short. I still recommend these big butt or not just because they're so warm and cozy :)"
4.0,didn't brake like my other ones i bought. lasted my whole 2nd/3rd trimesters.
4.0,Not easy to use but very strong. I wouldn't advise taking too much faith in the TSA lock though as you can easily loosen the strap and open the luggage. Make sure to wrap around handles for extra protection.
4.0,Wore as Maternity - 7 - 9 months pregnant in XL. Fit fine.
4.0,Can‚Äôt really expect much for the price
4.0,The dress was a bit too big but super cute
4.0,Nice everyday minimalist wallet. Thin and it‚Äôs an easy fit in a front pocket to avoid back issues
4.0,I wasn‚Äôt aware these were made of thin nylon. I would have like them a whole lot better if they had been made of cotton or polyester blend. Other wise they are pretty and the sizes are great for organizing thins
4.0,"Would‚Äôve given a 5 because of how cute and comfortable this is , but the shorts were so baggy that I had to fold them 2 times which wasn‚Äôt cute because you can see it with the shirt being open on my side ."
4.0,"This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, she will love it!"
4.0,Smaller than what it looked in the picture but still nice
4.0,Nice and comfortable. A bit large and long.
4.0,"Love them, Beautiful glasses! Used them for my Janis Joplin costume. Would have given five stars, but the nose rest is off on one side."
4.0,"I was unhappy with the fact that one of the front adjusting metal pieces was placed on the elastic backwards, thus I was going to give it a lower review.  I was able to replace the adjusting piece by prying it apart and replacing it.  It held and I was able to use the suspenders.  I liked the width of the elastic.  I sometimes have trouble with stretch jeans staying up so I thought I would try suspenders.  I am able to wear them under my tops so that they do not show but they accomplish what I need them to do, hold up my jeans."
4.0,Nice and very interesting just as pictured.
4.0,"It looks beautiful, it feels beautiful it was for me an awesome buy..."
4.0,Beautiful. We ordered a 7-8 and glad we did because if fits but if we would have ordered the 6 it would not have.
4.0,"I was looking for leggings with pockets to hold my phone when I go for walks. These has no problems holding my samsung S20 FE with a popsocket at all. I'm 5'3"" and I weight 160lbs I ordered the large is high waisted. But they do slide down on me. I have to pull them up when I walk."
4.0,"I absolutely love these readers. I had cataract surgery which left me 20/20 distance vision but farsighted. I use progressive lenses at work so I can focus up close and midrange working on computer. The rest of the time when not working on computer I was looking for readers for up close because I'm not typically wearing glasses. These readers have been a Godsend. They are comfortable, the optics are fantastic and the lenses render crisp, clear vision. The only reason I did not give a 5 star is because of the limited selection. I tried to order the Stella for a friend in 2.0 but they only had 1.5 and 2.5 in that design. PLEASE add the 2.0 in the Stella and PLEASE create more color/pattern options so I can buy more. Even my pug likes them."
4.0,Casually elegant
4.0,"The moment i saw these glasses i knew they would be perfect for my mom as she's an avid reader & lives in Florida.  She enjoys reading in her backyard on her lounge chair.<br />The glasses offers a tint & 1.5 lens. While these aren't pure sunglasses that will block enough sun to make reading enjoyable sround any glare. Built quality is not the best at this price point, but adequate for its functions of light reading. It comes with a hard case to store them.  The design is attractive you wouldn't even know they were reading glasses by looking at them until you look more closely. My mom enjoys these glasses during her backyard readings and recommends them."
4.0,pink and sparkly!!  who could ask for more?
4.0,product seems to be  well made and looks like what is advertised i would reccomend to someone to purchase this item
4.0,"Fits well. I love the off the shoulder look. I‚Äôm a size 6 and bought a medium. The fabric is hot though, I assume because it‚Äôs 96% polyester. I wore it to an outside event and will definitely only be wearing it to air-conditioned locations."
4.0,"Fits perfectly. I got the XS (waist 26"") and it's exact--note that the fabric is not elastic at all. The skirt part zips up the back up to the waist, so it is not flexible about fit. It looks really cute; the red is a cheery cherry.<br /><br />The dress could be improved with a bit of elastic at the back, and with a lining for the skirt part."
4.0,I like the Amethyst ring. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the workmanship for the cost.
4.0,"Wasn't the colors pictures, but I like it."
4.0,"I like these shirts, I just gave them 4 stars since they were a little small. They do stretch so they fit, but they're a little tight. I would order them again, just in a larger size!"
4.0,Brushes on easily. Dries clear and quickly. It would be &#34;5 Stars&#34; if it dried without any tack. We'll see how long it holds up...
4.0,"this dress is very beautiful but not for my size because i m looking fat in this dress,sadly i am returning this ."
4.0,a little shorter than expected.
4.0,"Really pretty dress.  My daughter wore it to her Sophmore dance.  The opening in the back was a little loose, so we put a few stitches in it.  The dress is short but not as bad as many other dresses out there.<br /><br />The fabric is a little cheap, but it will most likely not be worn again, so we were fine with it for one dance.<br /><br />She is 5' 4&#34; 120lbs. and the small fit her great."
4.0,I really loved these sandals.  The color and the quality were very nice.  I purchased them knowing I generally wear a 7.5 but these only come in whole sizes.  True to form they were too big and I had to send them back.  If you wear a whole size they are definitely worth the price.
4.0,lasts a long time
4.0,the nose piece was  too lose  but i love the size of the sunglasses..
4.0,"The shoes really need insoles. It seems like whoever made them in China just forgot to put insoles in. Other than that the shoes are great: sturdy, nice and sharp.<br />Do note that the specified size is on the large side. I bought 0.5 size smaller than I usually buy and I still had to by insoles."
4.0,So this looks it was meant for my Citizen ProMaster Tough watch.  Color of red stitch and black band match dial and second hand perfectly.<br /><br />- It's a thick silicone band that I think needs to break in a bit over time.<br />+ I have a small wrist and use the 2nd to last hole but the length does not extend far so a larger wrist may not be good for some.
4.0,It feel good and it works I getting me a few more for daily use.
4.0,"handled well, feels like they can take some abuse and not break."
4.0,I ended up having to use both rings I got to hold my keys and everything else because they were smaller than I expected but otherwise they definitely do their job.
4.0,"I thought these would be more ""mesh""-like, but to me they feel like black string woven together ... But that is all they are after all. I am short and average so they fit, they have a good stretch to them for taller people. They are nice, for what I paid for."
4.0,Little on the smaller side hopefully it fits my daughter!..
4.0,"Very cute , however no warm inner lining.y son will definitely always need a sweater underneath"
4.0,"Good for the price, seem sturdy enough, doesn't look to high end but for the price it's a good deal. They really do protect your eyes from the sunlight..."
4.0,Works great once you get it onto your watch. It's really hard to get it to go all the way and snap into place but once you do it's very secure. I would definitely recommend this.
4.0,"This is really cute and comfortable!! The color is a little lighter in person but besides that, it looks exactly as pictured. For reference, I am 5‚Äô6 150 lbs and I ordered an extra large as I typically size up on amazon. It fits nicely with a bit of room so I probably could have gotten a large, but I‚Äôll keep the xl. I would recommend this if you like rompers!!!"
4.0,"Super cute and look lovely with just about every outfit! Only downside is they don't last long. The clasps are kind of small, so I have trouble clasping them. Also the first time I tried on the black velvet one I ended up ripping the clasp off. With extended use I noticed that they start to lose the choking effect and become loose. However, for the price and look I'd say it's still worth it!"
4.0,Cool Color
4.0,"Overall good quality shirt.  However, if you want a loose fit like shown go up a size or two."
4.0,Awesome price for the quantity
4.0,Variety of colors and we love the one we got.  perfect!!!
4.0,Much looser and relaxed fit than the picture suggests. Also much thinner fabric than pic suggests. Can really only strictly use as pajamas can not ever walk out with this on. HUGE DIFFERENCE than the short sleeved set I got from same brand. Those can actually be worn as an outfit.
4.0,"I only gave 4 stars because the hook that closes the pin was stuck and the pin broke. I did not contact the seller, but the 4 stars are towards the product. The reason I did not contact the seller, my husband soddered it together and I sewed it onto the banner. The pin was shipped fast, but I had no time to send it back to get another."
4.0,A+100% Satisfaction üëçüèΩ
4.0,Very long. Im 5'7 and need heels or wedges to wear without  bottoms dragging the ground. However - it is so comfy and fits as expected. Very cute.
4.0,"Mostly wool with some cashmere; very soft, nice design. My boyfriend liked it, but the medium was a tad snug, and he's tall and this didn't come in extra tall. Returning - but highly recommend this sweater to others."
4.0,"Although I loved this , I wish you can pick and choose a different size for the bottom or top. That‚Äôs the only thing I wish I could change. I needed a medium for the bottom and a large for the top."
4.0,"Very nice, if slightly thicker would be a five star...."
4.0,i thought i read these ran big.  Not for me Medium does not fit my size 12 butt and had to be returned.  But the pants are nice quality.
4.0,The shirt does have a sheerness to it.  I does fit well even as a plus size. Looks adorable with a belt around waist. Wish arm size was a bit bigger although it was fitted around the arm there was a bit of a stretch. Overall a refreshing looking shirt. Good buy.
4.0,Good fit well made high quaility fabric. Its an attractive shirt . I prefer a solid color and their colors are appear to be a mix of hues of the same color pallet over all a deep blue but not solid navy. Just my preference others may like the color scheme. Other wise I would have given it a 5 star rating.
4.0,These earrings are really pretty but rather heavy on your ears.
4.0,"I bought these lights from East Vita, and they arrived in a bag, with no padding, and two or three broke when i was checking to see if they worked. About five were duds, but I bought them all for myself, so I could type in the dark, so I didn't really notice. They arrive with rubber bands that keep the lights attached to the fingers. I have rather large fingers, so I was pleased to find that these stretched easily enough for my purposes. the lights were very bright.<br /><br />A year later, I bought a set of 80 lights from a seller called Elekticity, not sure of the spelling. I was pleased to find that these arrived in a box, and i was happily surprised to see that my package included a bonous package of five more finger lights, free. The plastic in these lights was much thinner and lighter than that of the lights I bought previously, but a grand total of 14 were entirely nonworking, and were thrown into the trash immedeately. Then, once I tried to  wear these, the elastic ring part of the light was far more plasticine than the bands of the forty I bought the year before. I placed the order for these on a friday, and i recieved the items on the next monday, despite the fact that the shipping options were nowhere near that fast. These have a larger opening into which one could slip the nand in and out, so I must say, I  liked the lights in the set of 80, but I liked the bands better in the set of 40 I bought the year before. The lights on these were also about twice as bright. The only way this one could be any better is if there was a smaller space for the band to slip in, because I don't know or understand why you would want to separate the band from the light in the first place."
4.0,Super cute and the high waist is flattering! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and usually wear a size 2 or 4. The size Small in these pants fit great! Length falls at my ankles. The green is more of a forest green but still cute.
4.0,"This is cute. It is not for small dogs as was stated in the description at the time I ordered. It drapes down to the floor. It cannot be easily doubled over. So I gave it to my son for his husky mix. She is about 45 pounds and it fits her ok, even a little loose. It is more of a thug looking chain for a pit bull then a pretty chain for a girl dog. I would recommend for a bigger dog."
4.0,These are just so comfortable. All the time. Cool in the hot afternoon. Pretty colors. I‚Äôm just hoping they withstand the torture of my stupid HE washing machine.
4.0,"Much bigger than I thought it would be, but still cute."
4.0,"Beautiful Initial Pendant, the chain could have been of better quality."
4.0,I do like this wallet. Its functional and classy. My only complaint is that things fall out of it.. I wish it zipped instead of buttoned. I recommend..
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5bfe7572b71456c8b53a003cc1bb5191]] I love this dress!  My shoulders are a bit to wide for this dress to be off the shoulder. I bought a size medium, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 170 lbs and the dress felt a little loose. I think I could wear a size small in this dress if I want a more cinched look.  Overall the dress feels and looks nice !"
4.0,Very nice. Washed very well.
4.0,Dress is very nice. Only it runs small. Sent it back.
4.0,I was expecting the bow tie to be a little bit bigger then it was since the tie is for a man.
4.0,So far it works well. I just wanted a nice-looking watch to wear with dress clothes. For $16 you can't beat that
4.0,"Was very happy with the look and style of this band. No issues witg using the tool, you just have to center the tools pin over the band pin which can be a little tricky. But given a little care it isn't an issue which will solve what seems to be a large majority of complaints. I like the weight of the band, it gives the FitBit a feel of quality, I have never liked cheap flimsy light weights. Several people complain of scrtches and the like when they received their watch, likely they ended up with a retuned band, mine came &#34;like new&#34;.<br />My only compliant after 4 months is that a link broke. Fortunately I saved the ones I had removed and remembered where I had put them. A simple fix. I only hope it was a one time occurance because I like the band.<br />Up until yesterday when the band broke I would have given this band 5 stars."
4.0,It‚Äôs what i needed for easter!comfy & soft
4.0,"Not what I expected, but will keep it."
4.0,"This is a decent pair of summer pajamas, but I feel that the bottoms could be made of a &#34;softer&#34; cotton material...more similar to the top, which is nice."
4.0,"I chose to purchase this bracelet and the matching necklace to wear on my wedding day.  They are gorgeous!  The picture does not lie.  The chain is big, but that's the style I normally go for.  I NEVER purchase jewelry online, but I had a good feeling about this product.  It is stunning!"
4.0,"Love these, would buy again.<br /><br />Quality: Good product for price. Not the most luxurious material but very affordable, so can‚Äôt complain. Have worn, washed once (hang dry) and the fit has held up fine.<br /><br />Fit: I‚Äôm a 32-34 A-B, ordered a Medium. Fits great and comfortable. Some bralettes I find to become too tight in the ribs throughout the day but these are a great fit. Flattering and light support.<br /><br />Esthetic: a good basic bralette, not fancy, perfect for casual weekend outfits. Good coverage. Unlined so you will nip through, the white is slightly see through."
4.0,"This is a good product, it is too tight for me."
4.0,I have Bust 92 and the M was too large for me so I ordered the S and it fits perfectly. It is a little see-through; however I will wear it with a sports bra in nude color and then it's fine. The material is quite cheap so if you sweat it will not absorb anything and leave you with wet arm pits. But for the price I guess it's still a good top.
4.0,"Nice fabric, use often, meets needs"
4.0,Needed a cheap pair of second goggles for night skiing - these will work just fine.
4.0,the syle of the shirt is very nice but mines was a bit too big I was going by my breast size.
4.0,"I like the style, and the sleek look. Only thing that I didn't like was upon delivery one of the lens was not in the frame, so I had to put it back in the frame other than that, I would recommend these glasses."
4.0,Works great for my kindergartener! Just wish the lunch box stayed closed better. The Velcro is not very strong
4.0,True to size. I love it and it's very soft. I would recommend it!
4.0,"You need to keep this dupatta carefully, as the stars on the dupatta keep getting entangled with each other."
4.0,I am not crazy about the neck and it is a little too long. I am only 5'3&#34; but the dress is BEAUTIFUL. I hemmed it and I really like it!
4.0,My husband wore this tie for his 50th birthday party and got a lot of I like that tie man.
4.0,"It looks wonderful and fits well. The clasp is a little difficult to do by yourself, but otherwise it's great and I'm very happy with it!!"
4.0,Cute - fits true to size
4.0,"I'm a true 3X (their max size) and was disappointed that this lovely coat is ""snug."" However, I love it so much I'll dress lightly and carry a wrap for when I take it off LOL. I bought it based on positive reviews, and during Amazon ""deal."" Very well packed in plastic zipper container, therefore wrinkled, nothing the dryer can't sort. You will not be disappointed."
4.0,The material is nice and the dress fits great. Removed one start because the design on the top doesn‚Äôt perfectly align with the design on the bottom. Otherwise I love this dress.
4.0,I love these bags. They are so cute and colorful. They make great gifts for my sons teachers to fill with goodies for Christmas. I wouldn't buy them here. My mom picked me up a bag in Vegas for $2.99
4.0,"Cute, nice, functional, actual knee height. If you have larger calves and want to use them at knee height, they will probably be too tight.  I do not have skinny calves, probably normal for someone who wears a size 10 shoe, and they are snug and stay up. They do not have much give. I use them all the time, I only wish they were softer"
4.0,My teen daughter loved this..
4.0,"For the price I honestly cannot complain, but when you put your cards into the slots it‚Äôs hard to put your money into the back pocket. Overall it‚Äôs really helpful, but you just have to be careful when using it."
4.0,Very cute. Waiting for it to get cold. Love the colors. Fits perfect.
4.0,The comfort.
4.0,"The Colors are a little different than I thought. The what appears to be read is actually purple. But overall it‚Äôs incredibly comfortable, warm, and looks really nice. It fits really well. And overall a really good value."
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable. I love the feel and flow of this dress. I think I'll only wear it around the house, because it is a bit thin. Also I got a size bigger then I should have because I didn't want it too tight. I like the neck and shoulder line. I don't have a bra that matches the shoulder straps. But I enjoy wearing this dress on hot days around my place."
4.0,"Well for the price it is very reasonable, especially considering the larger size, usually my sizes cost double the amount in which I paid on here. The material is good, the only issue was that the wire in the cup started to come out the first day I wore it, guess it wasn't sewn it that good, but still worth it."
4.0,"The Top/dress is as described.  I actually like it. It's light weight and reasonably well made. HOWEVER..... I ordered a Medium.  They shipped an XXL.  It's not worth returning, I purchased it for a discounted price.  But come on.... Medium and you ship XXL?  REALLY???  The only plus here, is that I'm pretty sure the Medium would have ended up being too small. Cuz if this is an XXL then I would have wanted a Large, not a medium.  I'm actually able to wear the XXL for yoga and around the house.  I'm only 5'3&#34; and typically wear a size 8.  If you really do wear an XXL normally, then I would imagine you would want a XXXXL if they even make such a thing.  Order up at least one size... and good luck if you get the size you ordered.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/12/17<br /><br />Because of my not so great review the seller reached out to me and sent me the size medium. Although they did send it in the wrong color (I originally ordered black in Medium) this time I got blue in Medium.... the medium actually does fit.  It's just a tiny bit tight, but that's because I do like my clothing to be very loose, so actually for someone 5'3&#34; and weighs 140lbs, Medium does fit.<br /><br />I must say the black is really pretty.  Not as fond of the blue, but both are well might and the fabric is light and nice.  I have changed my starts to 4 and Fit as Expected based on receiving this new one."
4.0,"Amazing little shades for my little man. Super sturdy, beautiful colors and an awesome little car holder to keep them safe for when he‚Äôs done. Awesome purchase!"
4.0,Perfect! I wish the strings were longer though. Fits 4x male.
4.0,"So the product itself looks like it is made of nice material. The picture is an accurate depiction of the dress. However, I ordered a 2XL and it had no hope of zipping in the back. The sleeves were tight on my arms and the waistline was tight as well. For your reference regarding regular sizes, I wear XL tops and size 16/16W in pants or dresses. So in general, a 2XL should be quite roomy and I was ordering a larger size thinking I wanted to be sure it fit. I am sending it back because I will never be small enough to fit in this dress. If you have broad shoulders (not fat ones), this is not for you. If you have a slim build like the photo shows, then you may have better luck. It's a beautiful garment and I am disappointed it doesn't fit."
4.0,"Very nice headband. The quality was better than I expected. It's not heavy on your head, but it's not light either. It does what it was designed to do."
4.0,"We measured hubby's foot as instructed before placing order, but the shoe still fit too small.  Returning shoe and will order the next 2 sizes up so he can try on and choose from them."
4.0,Dress has soft and comfortable fabric! It‚Äôs slightly see through so I‚Äôll probably wear with a slip. Overall i love it!
4.0,"Plenty of room through the chest and arms, I am very pleased with the polo"
4.0,"I made the mistake of going up two sizes. I‚Äôm normally a XS, but purchased a medium thinking it‚Äôll shrink a lot because it‚Äôs fleece; however it really maintained its shape and size very well after the wash and drying. I‚Äôm still very happy with it despite it being big on me. I would like to re-order in black in a size small to see if it‚Äôll look better on my petite frame; I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 115 lbs. The dark gray on me didn‚Äôt give me the sexy look like the model in the ad. I look and feel more comfy in my sweater dress, but that‚Äôs ok; probably if I paired it with thigh high heeled boots it‚Äôll look sexier. The dress was very soft and super warm. The dress falls mid thigh. I would definitely buy again for the price ($15)."
4.0,"Looks good fits pretty well. Was the color scheme I like. Worn & washed a few time, no change. It was a little high priced but I feel I got what I wanted so that was little concern"
4.0,I like it. It‚Äôs just right for me and my purse.
4.0,"Durable, beautiful shoe. The laces come loose really easily for some reason. Runs small."
4.0,It was described well !!! Not a bag that can stand the rain !!!
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô5, about 145 lbs, and I got a large. I usually wear a medium, and I should have ordered a medium because the large is a little big on me. It‚Äôs comfy and I like the design, but my issue with this shirt is that, while the design looks like it‚Äôd be flattering (curves in around waist), the actual shirt does not curve in around the waist. I wish it did. But it is still a cute shirt and I still plan to wear it."
4.0,Love the look but good be better quality. You can‚Äôt beat the price though. My husband had to fix after a few months but nothing big. Just glad i could find all the parts for it to be done
4.0,"They are not TOO heavy,<br />but they have more weight to them<br />than some of my other earrings.  The gold<br />trim looks nice and I think they appear to be more<br />expensive than they are."
4.0,Quality is not so good
4.0,Less a star because it turned yellow among other white stuff. Which are still white and only used once
4.0,Solar powered is the best. No batteries to change
4.0,"Really like this bag, it's not something I normally go for but its cute non the less"
4.0,i like the quality and the look
4.0,"The fit of these water shoes are good. Quality is a little low. We noticed substantial wear and tear after just 2 hours at the splashpad, BUT given how fast toddler feet grow, we only anticipated using these shoes for one season. I would buy these again!"
4.0,"Works with lots of outfits, not cheap looking either."
4.0,Love the item! Great quality. I had to have it taken in though because it is way too big. I am 5'7&#34; and 130 Lbs with an athletic build. I got the medium and it falls off my waist.
4.0,"This maxi-dress is soft, comfortable and perfect for relaxing about the house, garden, beach. Even though mine is XS, it drapes on me to my ankles with the armholes large enough to expose my bra. I love that the fabric is a cotton/recycled polyester mix and the company sounds ecologically aware and socially responsible, so I checked out their weblink. It's selling mostly shirts and hoodies right now, but I am impressed and will keep an eye open for more dresses or skirts."
4.0,"My daughter is using this hat for protecting her from the tropical sun while she's in marching band practice.  Her old hat from Chinatown lasted a few months, which was pretty good considering it looked like it was for tourists and intended to last no longer than 2 beach days.  So we'll see if this one lasts.<br /><br />It was a little on the large side, and darker than she wanted it.  And it was pretty bent out of the box.  I think the rim will eventually straighten out, but right now there's a big bend in it.  Serves the purpose to throw some shade, though, and the hat appears to not flop down into her eyes..."
4.0,"Love the scallops but it was very short. Im 5'3"" and 200lbs.. im self conscious of my tummy so I got a 2xl thinking that it would be longer and lose but it was super short. Besides that its a cute top."
4.0,Size up and it will fit as expected! :)
4.0,I love this purse just hope the crease in the middle comes out
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings and even though they're clip-ons they're too heavy. But, since yesterday, I received another pair of earrings that came with some type of cushion between the post and the earring that was used for protection, so, rather than discard it, I put it on the back of these clip-ons and wallah! Now they're hardly noticeable when worn and I believe they won't give me any problems. So I added two more stars."
4.0,Cute! Love the color and can be worn to work out or for a casual day out and about.  Love that is has a bit of a classier look to it. Only thing I didn't like is there are no pockets and it does snag easily.
4.0,The fit and style
4.0,"Material very soft and thin, perfect for summer."
4.0,Pretty pricey and I wish they had brighter colors
4.0,Loved these but fit exactly on my bigger wrists. Had no room for movement. Loved them but had to return.
4.0,Very cute dress for the price. Everyone loved it. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 155 lbs and I ordered a large and it fit great.
4.0,"I love this black band! It doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin like the silicone ones do. I‚Äôve been wearing it for a few weeks and it hasn‚Äôt fallen off like I read in some other reviews. It was super easy to swap out. The only reason I subtracted a star is because the band is super long. I have big wrists (for a woman) and I wear the band at the 3rd hole from the end. I imagine that women with skinny wrists might have to punch a new hole to get the band to fit tighter.<br /><br />Overall, I‚Äôm extremely pleased with this purchase!"
4.0,Pretty cool would have given 5 stars but the description is false as the strap is not even fakeleather. It an elastic strap.
4.0,"Good quality, a bit heavy"
4.0,"greto accessories, used the for an 80's party and got lots of compliments.."
4.0,Wish it was a little thicker but I live it very much..
4.0,"Great pair of ""working"" socks except when used with steel toe boots, toes only were cold but rest of foot comfortably warm...would recommend"
4.0,"nice shirt for a cruise, which is why I bought it for hubby."
4.0,"Super cute, pants are a little long but love it!"
4.0,"I loved it except I wish the letters were a bit smaller. It was hard trying to get a picture with all the letters showing, I had to leave it like that ( see picture)"
4.0,Great dress but super thin fabric.  But other than that it was just want I wanted
4.0,I really like the watch face and for the price I think this is a great product. The watch band is cheap quality but I didn't mind for the price. It was delivered more quickly than expected. Overall I really like this watch. Looks great with any outfit!
4.0,Great color length and construction. Fantastic addition to my wardrobe. I have not been let down by this brand. Highly recommended!
4.0,"I like this a lot. Not too big and bulky, but holds much and has nice compartments. The external USB and the slot to run headphones out of the top are largely why I purchased this ...  coupled with the price. At this price point, it's a great value. I reserved a star, because the velcro strap that secures the laptop, inside the padded computer area, seems to be designed ONLY for 17&#34; computer. In that, the velcro you secure the strap to, is at the top of the padding -- so the strap would go up and over a large computer and then reach that velcro.  However, I'm using a MacPro 13&#34; and the strap needs to secure further down. A simple fix would be a LARGER, longer, piece of velcro, so it connects no matter what computer you're using. Kind of surprised they missed this. Otherwise, a great backpack for the price."
4.0,"These are really cute earrings. Just a couple of things to keep in mind before you decide to buy them. The colors are less vibrant than in the picture...but still, pretty colors. They have a nice, satiny finish. They have different backs...some have the backs with the plastic disk that's great for support for people with larger earlobes or lobes that have been stretched from wearing heavy earrings for years. Also, on multiple sets, the posts were completely bent...and it was a little concerning that they would break if you straighten them out..in fact, one of them did. Other than that, they're adorable."
4.0,Got the xl. It is closer to a m/l. I LOVE IT. I will just get rid of a few pounds! On the pics you can't see the detail on the neckline. Would have gotten a 5 star except for sizing
4.0,Comfortable and stylish but runs a bit narrow.
4.0,very confortable!
4.0,I like the slim fit wallet for work. I just don't have room for my big bulky wallet all the time. I can just take what I need and go.
4.0,cute matches my shoes perfectly
4.0,"Great set for the price. I was given a discount for a review. Honestly is good for the price, but I wish it comes with a 24&#34;, I am caught between a giant luggage and a carryon..."
4.0,"Super cute and great fit in women's sizing. Love DeFeet socks for cycling. I do prefer 2&#34; socks, but 3&#34; isn't too bad."
4.0,I bought this dress for a wedding that I was in. I got the largest size - I believe an XL? It was higher quality than I expected! It had a good weight to the dress - it didn‚Äôt feel cheap. It was longer than I expected but it was perfect for dancing to make sure I could jump around without it showing too much. The top was very loose - I‚Äôm about a 38D and didn‚Äôt wear a bra. I sewed the lining the top on my own and pulled the thread to tighten it. It was the perfect dress and so affordable!
4.0,"I love these! They're great and helped my daughter's ear heal up nicely. The only problem I ran into, was I have to use different backs. The backs these came with are so tight I could barely even get them off, let alone back on. Otherwise, love love lovvvve them for her."
4.0,They are really cool looking. Hang a little lower than I wanted but still nice. The tear drops move out of place when you move a lot but worth the purchase
4.0,Was given as a gift for my grandson
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and around 110 pounds. I heard it ran small so I got a medium and was worried it'd be too small. It's not. It's ever so slightly loose but I can't tolerate clothes that squeeze me. My only worry is that swimsuits sometimes loosen when wet and I may be swimming in it! I haven't worn the bottoms much. I ordered it for the top. Same goes for it though. For the price, it's great. The top has padding. The bottoms are very thin. If I had it to do over, I may have gotten a small but when I'm afraid the top would've ripped putting it on."
4.0,I like the way they make my feet and ankles swell from a leg injury. They feel great and ease the pain.<br />BUT after that the pain comes back and slowly intensifies until I can‚Äôt stand it and have to get them off.
4.0,"Definitely exactly as pictured, very clinched at waist and flairs out, if you‚Äôre curvy I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it because it‚Äôs semi stiff and will appear bigger than your actual hip size, could be nice as a tulle skirt under a larger dress but don‚Äôt recommend by itself"
4.0,Great for water play.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter, I think she'll like it. The key-chain appears to be well-constructed and has a nice message. It came in a nice ""velvet"" pouch that adds class as a gift. Not a large key-chain so it won't be a burden once the keys are on it. Time will tell..."
4.0,Worked for the job needed.  Nothing fancy but good buy.
4.0,Comfortable and good quality material.<br />Didn‚Äôt shrink much after washing and drying.
4.0,The fit is a bit unusual on this shirt - in the chest up it runs true to size but in the stomach and waist  it runs quite small. I am glad I sized up in it.
4.0,This ring is a lot prettier than the photo shows. I gave it to my daughter as a surprise for everything she does. She loved it!
4.0,The color was more vibrant than the picture online.  The strap seems strong and the young woman who received it was thrilled to start using it.
4.0,These shoea are beautiful. I actually wear a 9 1/2 so i thought ordering a 40 (or 10) would give me plenty of room. However they are very tight.
4.0,"Hat is very nice, comfortable, keeps you warm and fits right.<br />A little pricey takes away 1 star"
4.0,Pretty. It definitely fit the Fitbit. But the Fitbit holder was too decorative and tarnished on the skin side.
4.0,It fits perfect! Quality is ok with this price.
4.0,leggs control top pantyhose are very nice pantyhose. i have these pantyhose in reinforced toe pantyhose and sheer pantyhose nylons. i wear pantyhose and nylon pantyhose all day. i like pantyhose that stay up all day pantyhose and pantyhose that are sheer silky pantyhose. my pantyhose are pantyhose that are sheer pantyhose with reinforced pantyhose feet. my leggs pantyhose are all day pantyhose and very silky sheer pantyhose. some of my pantyhose by no nonsense pantyhose or other nylon pantyhose are nice pantyhose but pantyhose are sheer pantyhose as well as silky silky pantyhose on my leggs pantyhose. my leggs pantyhose with control top pantyhose are very sheer pantyhose i can wear all day pantyhose nylons with sheer toe pantyhose.
4.0,"Person in blue 5‚Äô3 and 120lbs got a small and person on right 5‚Äô3 135lbs got a medium. Fit was great. When it stretches, there is a white inner layer that cones through the black. Would have been better if it had a black lining. But this fit was nice and comfortable. Lots of compliments. Very form fitting."
4.0,This product is very sturdy but yet very late I love the bands
4.0,"Looks good, pleased with purchase."
4.0,Only thing I did not like was the pockets. Did not realize it had pockets
4.0,"Easy for my 5-year-old to put on, versatile style, she wears them to play and to church. They are still holding up well after a month of daily use."
4.0,"They are super cute! I wear some to school every day, I LOVE how there is so many options for every outfit, there‚Äôs just one thing the rings are a bit small I‚Äôm a size 7/8 so I had to stretch them with a ring sizer but overall 8/10"
4.0,"Cute rings, but they turned my fingers green."
4.0,It looks beautiful! Flowing and little small at bust!
4.0,Very light material but not see through. Was slightly larger than expected but I am bustier so it works fine. Bought in two colors and will probably buy more in the future
4.0,Cute holiday shirt
4.0,"These fake nose rings are fun.<br />I always wanted a nose ring - but never got one,<br />The product description is 6 nose rings.<br />I actually got 9.<br />I got 3 black, 3 silver and 3 rose gold. I was hoping they would be gold but they are more brassy.<br />These are comfortable to wear and stay put."
4.0,"While the pants are soft and stretchy, the rainbow stripe is stiff and has no bend or stretch to it, makes these slightly less comfortable than they could be if they‚Äôd used a different material on the sides."
4.0,Got a big noggin and these fit. Ise them as ‚Äúthrow aways‚Äù at work.  Work in the FD and sunglasses are easy to misplace. These are cheap enough not to hurt my feelings if I do and thay look and feel fine.
4.0,"Great Optics, but the nose bridge is a bit large."
4.0,Very happy with the quality for the price
4.0,Great pair of shorts and they fit ok. Little bit snug not bad
4.0,"A little tight fitting,  but still fine."
4.0,Bought these for a party with a DJ - the kids LOVE them.  I order 50 of them and all of mine worked great. Great value.
4.0,I wanted it to fit more like a compression but it thin and loose
4.0,"I like how easy it is for kids, but it was a little big for my 4 year old daughter."
4.0,Great dress and very cute.  The x-small was still a a bit big for somebody with a 32C bra size.  Not unwearable but a it big still.
4.0,"They are very good gloves. However, I think I ordered womens gloves and I wanted mens. I gave them to my wife."
4.0,"I bought this skirt for a trip to Thailand and I loved it. While the skirt is black, the material is very soft and breathable, so I was very comfortable while abiding by all temple rules to have legs covered. The skirt was surprisingly long (I am 5'6&#34; which long legs) so I had to wear it a bit higher than my waist to prevent dragging."
4.0,"I ordered this for a Halloween costume, so I wasn't needing or expecting high quality. I think for the price, it's fine. Runs a bit small (I'm XS, ordered XS, fits snugly), but I wouldn't recommend changing your size down unless you're in between sizes."
4.0,MISSING THE TASSEL. THAT'S  WHY I GAVE IT FOUR STARS. OTHERWISE BEAUTIFUL
4.0,"good product, looks just like photo. Some of the syringe tips/needle parts are slightly bent but can be easily and carefully bent straight again. (unsure about how fragile bending makes the piece if over corrected or arrives too damaged)"
4.0,It's a clingy fabric so it shows everything. Nice quality though.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:50442e5029dc5509a686f2d4ceb89191]] I like this set. I was a bit disappointed when the Mommy's Bag came very bent and warped out of shape.<br /><br />The metal rods are very sturdy and strong which is a great feature. Unfortunately,  it made it difficult for me to try to unbend my bag. But under normal circumstances, it's great to have a bag that can withstand being packed to the max and not busting.<br /><br />I don't think you will be able to pack all you need in these 3 bags. It would have been nice it the middle and small sized bags were bigger. You will probably still need another bag.<br /><br />Overall, the set is cute and well made. I'm just upset mine came bent."
4.0,"You get a lot for your money, but you get what you not for... the silver is chipping and is discoloring. Pretty while they last."
4.0,"The boob pads are weird, they just kinda float inside the garment. but otherwise great fit"
4.0,"Good  durable band, comfortable and lightweight"
4.0,"This is a really cute print and a very sturdy case. The downside is that it isn't tall enough. My sunglasses are on the smaller side, but the case doesn't close completely when the glasses are inside. I think this is best made for small readers... But I am keeping it because it closes almost all the way. And it is cute!"
4.0,The shoe is as i expected it to be.  Light weight and breathable.  Sturdy.
4.0,"Very comfortable and not too hot.  They look well-made The only question is longevity.  That's why I give it 4 stars.  If it seems like I'll get a couple of years of usage, I'll upgrade the rating."
4.0,Nice scarf but not quite as long as I would like it to be.
4.0,What a bargain.
4.0,"This is a great product, very comfortable  to wear and very warm. It does not itch which is the main concern with these type of items. It is soft and snuggly, no complaints! 9/10"
4.0,Was bummed thinking with them being polarized tou wouldn't be able to see your eyes. Welp ya definitely can!
4.0,its a good hat but putting the falp over your mouth is a bit uncomfortable
4.0,Great fit. Light weigh<br />Love it
4.0,"I normally wear between a 7.5-8, with somewhat wide feet (usually 7.5W or 8M). An 8 in these fit perfectly. Given the height of the heel, these were definitely on the more stable side; my ankles rolled twice on uneven concrete in the dark, but I didn't have any problems with them in well-lit, level areas, even after a couple of drinks. I wore them out for about three hours, on my feet for about two of them. Not tremendously comfortable, but the major issue was rubbing on my pinky toes. A couple of strategically positioned band-aids would be helpful. On the whole, well-constructed and cute as anything. I would buy again."
4.0,"I liked it a lot it‚Äôs really soft and fits good. The pads can be removed or adjusted as needed. I saw some other reviews complain that you can see the pads but you just have to put them in the right spot, should be fine."
4.0,"Most of the ear cuffs where very nice but, there were few of them that were a bit small and didn't fit my ear."
4.0,I received the glasses in just 2 days which was super nice... The glasses are cute but I was a little disappointed in the case... I mainly chose these particular pair because of my addiction to zebra print and when the case arrived it was already peeling which upset me a bit but other than that they are perfect for the buy and the seller ships really fast!!! Would buy from seller again!
4.0,Great quality. Fits a tad bit large. Very comfortable and chic.
4.0,"I like everything about this hat. I just bought another to replace one I lost. However, the first developed stains that would not come out in the wash...probably not perspiration, maybe sunblock...so this time I bought a darker color. The original one was green ""hops"" and this is the dark blue/black check. Hopefully this one will not discolor."
4.0,"Very cute, but a little too big for my 2 year old.  She still loves them!"
4.0,I liked the earrings. However they appear bit smaller than what is shown on site.
4.0,The material is not what I expected. But it is cute and fits as expected .
4.0,Very nice fabric. Definitely shorter than I would like. Would still buy another.
4.0,Good alternative to Miraflex. The hooks that hold the strap to the glasses sometimes catch on stuff.
4.0,I ordered based off the size chart. I‚Äôm a 6-8 and ordered a M. I needed my boyfriend to help zip the upper portion of the zipper on the side because my rib cage is a little big. Overall it fit really nicely.
4.0,"cute necklace, close to movie however came bent"
4.0,"Fabric seems a bit thin, but only time will tell if it is durable."
4.0,Really comfy compared to some of my other cloth masks and it gets a laugh when I wear it.
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter who is a blossoming tween. There is a bit too much padding for my liking, but it fits otherwise. She says they are comfortable as well."
4.0,I just came back from a trip up north and took them with me. Oh so comfortable.
4.0,Horribly made!! The string broke the first time I wore it.<br />Funny how they hide one star reviews! I made this 4 stars just so it can be seen! Company doesn‚Äôt offer return or replacement. Very disappointed!!
4.0,"Super cute, I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with this outfit, came with a few strings from thread I had to cut off but it is cute for my lil guy. He‚Äôs bigger so the 6 month fit him well before I thought it would. Next time I will order bigger."
4.0,"I got this as a Lightning deal for $5 , but I would never pay $27 for it. It‚Äôs cute, but a little baggy at the bottom / side so I tied one side."
4.0,"I can‚Äôt comment on the size yet because the baby isn‚Äôt here yet. But one thing that stinks is that the black tie that keeps the tag on the product left a dye stain on it. Luckily it‚Äôs on the inside of the hat, hopefully it comes out in the wash but I doubt it."
4.0,Great. Exactly as expected and fitted
4.0,great fit and look!
4.0,"Pretty, and seems fine so far. Arms are a little tight. But still a good buy."
4.0,Great purse. Great size
4.0,Very nice and seems durable. Just wish the design was on both sides.
4.0,"I was delighted to have the opportunity to review these socks. They are similar to some other that I have and truly love. The colors in these socks are gorgeous, and I love the Greek key design. They are cozy, but not quite as thick as I would have hoped. Still, they are warm and pretty, and I will enjoy wearing them."
4.0,Good material but kinda small
4.0,"The only thing that concerns me is the unreinforced holes.  They seem like they may stretch or tear in short order.  This is only speculation, but that's my only concern.  Otherwise, I really like the looks, fit, and comfort.  I have an 8"" wrist, and I can wear it on the 4th or 5th hole from the end, so plenty of room"
4.0,Exactly whats shown and described.
4.0,"I ordered this pair for my 9 year old. He's normally a size 3 and this pair fit true to size, plus he has wiggle room in the front toe area. He loved them. He says they're very comfortable, even wears them in the house as slippers. We haven't used them in water or sand yet."
4.0,Baby shower gift. Everyone ooh and aahed when they opened the gift. It was a hit.
4.0,Looks great! Pants are itchy .
4.0,Great buy for your money. I've had mine for 5 months now and am ordering a new one.
4.0,It‚Äôs nice. A little heavy but not too bad. Super cute
4.0,Too big a spread
4.0,Beautiful watch. Colors are vibrant. Very Fashionable and light to wear
4.0,great in length but a little small on the elastic part around the waist. I'm 5'7 and 127lbs..
4.0,"I love the way the shirt looks, but it runs very large. I couldn't wear it so I had to return it."
4.0,"You can't really see it in the picture but there is a seem between the bust and the belly button.  I threw a belt on it, and it looks great.  The sleeves are in fact a little puffy at the shoulders but it still looks great."
4.0,Perfect fit - love it.
4.0,I like the shirt except it fits a little small. I am a petite woman and I ordered the small size.
4.0,"Flexible, looks great but I wish it had just a bit of extra length and was somewhat thicker."
4.0,I love this jacket it is light and comfortable but I must say it runs bigger than my size I thought would fit me. I had no problem returning and getting the next size down.
4.0,Cute socks. Not thin like nylons and not thick like winter wool socks. Soft cotton. Fits just above the knee. Looked great with my Thing 1 outfit!!
4.0,Nice just a little too big
4.0,Would purchase it in different colors.
4.0,"These are beautiful and look great on they don't slip off which my other was crawlers always do, however they hurt like hell after a couple hours of wear. The top part that keeps then nicely secured to the upper part of the ear is like a torture device which is too bad because they really are pretty!"
4.0,I do a lot of shopping &#34;back leading&#34; when people don't know what to get for someone.  I ordered these for my brother to give our niece and she loved it.  I think I would even wear this.  Very cute.
4.0,"They are rather pretty, the shipping took a long time but that was posted on the item."
4.0,"Well made, as described, comes as rawhide color and flat, so you have to plan for neutral oil:waxing and flexing before it fits around your wrist, but after it settles in, very chique-looking, several in the office switched to leather after they saw it. Also it doesn't come with pins, so keep that in mind, and because it's rigid when it's new, you need a cheap Chinese screwdriver kit and tongue-twisting to get it locked onto your watch, where it stays. Leaves no mark or ring on your wrist, very comfortable like a favorite pair of leather shoes."
4.0,Leopard prints are &#34;In&#34; with little princesses.
4.0,Color was more royal blue than expected.<br />For back up mom dress for graduation...wore it.  Comfortable.<br />5'7&#34; 190lbs.
4.0,i got confused<br />my bolle is BOLLE MICROEDGE II<br />but it fits
4.0,"Arrived quickly. Item is rather large, feels like it would fit a man's face better than a smaller woman's face."
4.0,It's a little loose.  I wear a 12 usually but I got an XL.  I wanted to sleep in and be comfy. It's really cute with a cat face Love it. It's also not too short like some nighties/dress.  It's a very nice shade of black also.
4.0,"Colors are great, sleeve length perfect. Next time I will order XL because when I wash clothes always shrinks."
4.0,The earrings are a beautiful rose gold but I should have paid attention to the size. I live them they're just a little larger than I wanted.
4.0,String was very easy to knot up and it ended up breaking after the 3rd day so you may want a replacement for it. Other than that the coin is beautiful and solid.
4.0,"runs accoriding to size. i thought it would run small so i got a large ( i am 5'6 136lbs) and large was wayyyy too big. other than that, it's made nice"
4.0,Washed and dried on gentle an d lowest temperature on drier and the dress still wrinkled horribly. I dislike ironing!
4.0,"the shirt fits around the body as expected but the sleeves are about 1.5 inches short. Also the neck line is a bit odd. But for the price, cute shirt"
4.0,These are my favorite pajamas. They are so soft and fit great!
4.0,Perfect for my little Hasher!
4.0,It was what I expected. Something to throw on when going out and about. Can dress semi casual or with heels.
4.0,Love the color and texture.
4.0,i am a shot woman
4.0,Super cute! Took really long to get here but worth the wait
4.0,Way thicker than expected
4.0,"This was very cute and perfect for my Rapunzel Halloween costume. However, the ribbon holding the combs to the crown started unraveling after an hour of wear; not badly though. The comb stayed attached. Overall I was very pleased for the price."
4.0,"Great little watch for the money,"
4.0,"The dress fit well, but there was definitely some extra cloth at the top where it had nowhere to go. It would rumple and make weird bags above my chest which is odd, since I do have a large chest to begin with. The size it self was a good fit! And cleaning it is pretty easy. I would prefer this in a different cloth next time."
4.0,It looks exactly like the picture it looks really nice on me.
4.0,Somewhat Large
4.0,Very nice strap and a good match to my Aero leather jackets and Wolverine 1000 mile boots made from Horween Chromexcel leather. A bit thinner than I imagined and I do wish they offered (brushed) stainless steel hardware as an option. Time will tell how it ages but you will not find a Horween Chromexcel watch band for less money.<br /><br />I purchased the brown version as well.
4.0,Adorable and my daughter loves them!
4.0,Ordered a much larger size in order to get the fullness in the skirt I desired!  It was perfect.
4.0,"Highly recommend these~ as I do a lot of powerwalking and some jogging.<br />I had been experiencing callusing between a few of my toes, these have certainly taken care of that problem.- Besides being so comfortable and not dealing with the seam  at the tip of the toes!"
4.0,"This dress isn‚Äôt as full as I expected. I purchased a three ring hoop to go underneath and had to have alterations done to make it work. Maybe a different slip without the hoop would have been better? Very pretty gown, very well made especially for the price point. My daughter is tall and skinny so I went with a 5. She normally wears a 4 for the waist but needs 5 for length. The five was huge on her, but again, she is SKINNY. Still gorgeous, well made and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to purchase again from this seller. Shipping was fast!"
4.0,"Product is true to size, very good buy for the price."
4.0,Good quality it's just kinda big and long.
4.0,"Bought it for my sister and she carries it around with her everywhere.  Though there was some issues with the coin holder and bills in that she mentioned that you could either hold one or the other, but not both.  Serves its purpose though"
4.0,It was a great fit and received many compliments!
4.0,Great if you want lingerie. I wanted to wear this to a festival but it's not even appropriate for that. Fits a little small but not the worst thing ever.
4.0,My daugther love this
4.0,This is cute and I'll use it but the flap that covers the address information doesn't stay flat/closed; I will secure it with some tape or something since it most likely won't ever have to ever be opened anyway.
4.0,"I ordered this belt without any high expectations. I liked it! The belt looks exactly like the picture. The quality does not seem to be great, but it's value for money. The leaves on the belt are plastic and not metal, but they look cute. I wear size 4, but it seems a bit tight. Hopefully it will stretch with use."
4.0,I am actually really impressed with these airings I got them to give away as gifts and everyone who‚Äôs got them says they love how light weight they are and the fact that there is printing on both sides. I love these airings because of their light weight that‚Äôs not gonna pull on my ear and it‚Äôs going to feel like it‚Äôs barely there. I will definitely be buying again especially for people‚Äôs presents!!
4.0,"Wish it was a little more durable, but overall I love it"
4.0,PRO<br />Cute neckalace<br />Delivered fast<br />CONS<br />Have to re loop the string every time you wear it<br />(There is no snap buttons in the back)
4.0,"These are my absolute favorite leggings! Until I realized.. on cardio days .. don‚Äôt wear. These show sweat easily ! I had to wear a sweater tied around my waist because it was super noticeable! Unless you don‚Äôt care about a wet mark between your cheeks, these are adorable and super stretchy !"
4.0,I have an iphone 7 and use an otter box to cover it. I hate big purses so I have been trying to find a wallet that could hold my otter box covered phone. This wallet is the perfect size! My phone slides in so easily and is so snug. I am giving it 4 stars however because both the front button and the magnet came scuffed.
4.0,These earrings look good and are well-made. No complaints for the price.
4.0,Very tight if you get the wrong size. Feels good and looks good as well!
4.0,"It's exactly what I wanted, only downfall is that in the small pocket the zipper gets stuck half way there but besides that it's great."
4.0,Not flattering for stocky built person
4.0,Adorable dress. Color is a little more peachy than photo.
4.0,This was a gift for my husband. He loved it but it somehow fell apart. A pin popped out and when he tried to fix it more pieces kept falling apart and he finally gave up. I‚Äôm sure there was at least a little operator error but it also seemed to be a flaw in the design which is why I only have this 4 starts.
4.0,"It is a little narrower at the waist than I anticipated, but it still fits fine. It bunches a little when I move, but that's about it. The white fabric tends to wrinkle. Very sleek, however, and I don't regret buying it."
4.0,"Two things you need to know before you buy this:<br /><br />1 - It's thicker than most light weight neck gaiters.<br /><br />2 - It does stretch easily.<br /><br />Number 2 is the more important item.  This thing is borderline tight and putting it on can be a little cumbersome.  I'm certainly on the heavier side, so this might not be an issue for you.<br /><br />Overall this is a good neck gaiter and might offer more protection than your standard gaiter.  Just be prepared for  one that's tighter than you'd expect."
4.0,"These run small, but I anticipAted it and bought XL in charcoal and I love them.<br /><br />Sizing: I usually wear a size 10 for a comfortable fit, can wear an 8 for a slim fit but usually do not choose to do so. I bought these in Xl, washed in Cold, hung to dry. They stayed the same size and shape after washing. They fit perfectly. I maybe could have bought Large but they would be very tight and uncomfortable. The Xl is not loose fitting or baggy, they are comfortable.<br /><br />The charcoal is true to color. The inside lining is why I bought them. I have a skin condition, an illness really and when I get sick, my skin hurts, sometimes burns, fleece, Jersey or fur are the only fabrics that I can tolerate for any length of time. When I go out somewhere I try to wear nice pants but would like some that I can wear for longer periods of time, and these worked well for me. They are very soft inside and they look like regular pants, not fleece. My fleece leggings are getting pilled and the brand stopped making them, I have not been able to find any that are are honest in their description so I finally tried these fleece lined pants and I am so excited they worked.<br /><br />They are definitely heavier pants, they are not leggings weight, they are like real pants. They seem well made. I bought them in black and navy after wearing them. If you rearranged than a size 10, I do not think the Xl will fit any larger than a 12, and they would be tight I think."
4.0,"They are basically what I wanted, and made well, EXCEPT -- the fake leather on the buckle is already peeling off."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; 135 pounds and this is more like a string shopping bag, my friend found it fun though."
4.0,So pretty i love it! 4 stars because the color isn't as vibrant as it is in the pix. But it's very cute and I'm so glad i purchased
4.0,"After putting my wallet and small make-up bag in it, I barely have room for anything else. I was excited about the feet until I got it home - it makes the purse slide around on a table and it's very unstable. I will probably send it back and see if I can find something bigger in the same Jazzberry design."
4.0,"Very nice fit, almost like leggings.  Heavy, so should be warm in the winter.  Have only worn one pair once so far.  Washed and dried really well.  ( I put in the dryer by mistake, but it came out well.). Very long, so like another reviewer, this short lady scrunched it when I wore them.  Would be great tucked into short boots, but I don't have them.  Looked good with flat sandals when scrunched.  I got these at a great price, but I would buy more at a higher price.  Only criticism is that the pants would look better (smother) without the fake pockets, and loose nothing useful."
4.0,"I'm very happy with my purchase,"
4.0,"I ordered the large size and it is very small. Not the sellers fault, the tag reads size L, but it's more like a larger size small. It will still work, but won't look like I had hoped on me. The material is VERY thin, thinner than it looked on the photos, so think of it like a windbreaker only. It will work for summertime only. It's still a nice blouson for riding. I'm 5'11"" with a long torso and arms and the arms are borderline for me in length. Wished they were longer. Other than that, the style is definitely a European riding blouson, which is what I was looking for. I'm happy with the purchase overall."
4.0,"I love the shirt, it's just too small. It is an XXL, which is a size that I normally wear, but it'seems much too small. Maybe I can find someone  else to take it."
4.0,I wear old navy leggings in an xs or Xxs and love the fit of those. These are great. A great alternative to the more expensive leggings I have but I will say the crouch feels like it‚Äôs loser than I would like and would not look great if a shirt was not covering it.
4.0,Not much more needs to be said.
4.0,"I like the design on this cover up. The sleeves are a bit tight getting on and off, but have some stretch to them so it isn't a deal breaker. Also, rides up around the neck when walking."
4.0,"Precious dress, but it does run small.  I ordered a large instead of a medium and it's pretty tight.  Very sweet print and just a lovely dress overall."
4.0,So cute. Good size. Very pretty
4.0,Would not fit my daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than i am
4.0,Could use a bit bigger size.  They're on the smaller size (finger length) but are very comfortable inside.
4.0,"Very nice, same as shown in picture, as expected."
4.0,This was a Christmas gift and my daughter loved it
4.0,"The photo does not do justice to the unique shape of the wrap.  I'm not a fan of acrylic wool, but I ordered the wrap anyway.  It does not disappoint in quality or texture.  I would recommend this to a friend."
4.0,Super pretty! It is see through and very long.
4.0,"I really like this dress, however it doesn't really match the picture. I don't really mind because it's still nice, but its noticeably lighter in color and the fabric hangs differently. Like I said it doesn't bother me, but in reality the dress is more of a magenta/cranberry color than wine red.<br /><br />I ordered a size large, which is what I typically get with anything in Asian sizing. In US sizes I'm almost always an XS/S, so if you are tall/curvy you should definitely size up 1 or 2 sizes. I'm 5'7&#34;, ~130 lbs, 32D bust/25&#34; waist/35&#34; hips and carry pretty much all my weight in the butt/thigh area. I was worried the dress would be tight on my lower half because of this but it hangs nicely.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's a good length, me being tall-ish usually means I'm a large in anything in Asian sizing. I was glad to see the dress wasn't too short.<br />- Fabric is thick enough to not worry about underwear or anything showing through<br />- You can wear a regular bra with it<br />- Pockets!!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fabric wrinkles easily<br />- It was too big for me on the upper half. This is probably due to the fact that I have a tiny torso (I can fit into children's shirts easily...) more than the dresses' fault. There's still a good 2 inches of fabric that awkwardly flap out around my armpits that I'll need to pin when I wear it out.<br />- The adjustable straps are plastic and I can see them breaking easily<br />- For some reason Amazon doesn't list that this item has Prime? I got it with Prime shipping but the product page says it isn't eligible.<br />- The dress hangs differently on me than in the picture. That could be just the way it fits on me though...I like it better tied in a knot like in the picture I've attached anyway.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this dress - I will probably buy it in the blue color as well. Just make sure you read the product measurements. If you're petite you may be able to get away with your regular size, but like I said if you're at all curvy or above 5'4&#34; I'd go up at least one size.<br /><br />PS - the dress doesn't have an ombre IRL, for some reason my phone's camera gave it one"
4.0,"Comfortable royal blue silk shirt. True to color and size. Well made, but wrinkled. Washed well have yet to iron or wear other than to  try on. Pleased with purchase and bought another color."
4.0,"I was a little disappointed that the shirt is almost cropped and the shorts feel a size smaller than expected. Don't get me wrong, it fits, just not as loose as the picture shows. That being said, this is SO SOFT!!!!! It's lightweight without being completely sheer and I WILL be ordering it in several other colors."
4.0,"Cute but the thing is quite small, not sure if meant for small people or kids"
4.0,Great shirt for Dads!!  Good quality.
4.0,"Very good look and finish. X-large loose for 24-inch head, use headcover. Leather ear cover gets quite warm if you wear it indoors."
4.0,There is a weird pad in the front of each cup that isn't anchored.  It can easily be removed from the inner side pocket.
4.0,"Pretty, but a little bigger than expected"
4.0,"Beautiful chain, so far it‚Äôs been great"
4.0,They pretty much work as advertised.  The movement action is not as smooth as other shoe trees that I have but they work well.
4.0,Fabric was way too thin and also long. The star was weirdly shaped
4.0,"Liked the metal, although the leather is a bit shiny."
4.0,Fits pretty big but this is very warm and soft. I love this robe.
4.0,My daughter likes this dress.
4.0,Everything was great except the stocking were ro little
4.0,"I love it! It's so cute and different, but mine did have a small snag on it but its not bad. I just hope it doesn't get worse."
4.0,"Good product.  somewhat thick so , great on boat,  is comfortable but not super comfortable"
4.0,Bought it in a bigger size and it fits great.  Looks nice too.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"Great detail, but a bit small for a man."
4.0,The fit is great and the length is perfect. I‚Äôm right at 5‚Äô5. Very pleased with the quality
4.0,These run very true to size- order next size up if your foot is too swollen.  They are extremely hard to get on.
4.0,I bought these for my Thomas loving nephew for his birthday. They are adorable and he really loves them.... but they do run small.
4.0,"WIsh it were longer, but they were a huge hit for the bridesmaids for my sister's wedding."
4.0,"Fit great, and stay on. Even fits my 12 year old."
4.0,Gift for my son as he gets ready to graduate and enter the work force.
4.0,I have a 6 1/2 inch wrist and the strap is a bit tight. I would say if you're wrist is over 7 inches this isn't the strap for you. Other than that it's a great quality strap for the price.
4.0,"It's great quality, however I bought the size I usually buy on any brand and these were too small."
4.0,pricy
4.0,"I really like these pants and feel like they are very well made, however, they fit more like capri's and run quite small. I normally wear a 6 or an 8 and will need to order a 10. I have longer legs but usually wear normal length pants and these don't even cover my ankles. I ordered 2 pair and 1 of the 2 had the button hole sewn shut. I am still ordering a size up b/c they are so cute..."
4.0,I don‚Äôt like the edge of the sleeve it‚Äôs a cheaper finish
4.0,"It's a good jacket, but the zipper is extremely large for the type of jacket it is.  Seems like the kind of zipper you would have on a winter coat.  But the fabric is good and seems very well put together.  The color is a bright tomato orangy-red.<br />Fits true to size."
4.0,They are sexy.
4.0,"It fix small in the breast, everything else was fine."
4.0,"THIS WAS A GIFT , BUT HE SAID THAT HE LOVED THE SHIRT"
4.0,Dress is beautiful! My hips did not fill the dress so it was very baggin in that area but other than that i highly recommend. Great quality and good price!
4.0,"First off, I only use front pocket wallets. I have had about 6 in the last 10 years. Here are the pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />Quality materials. The fit and finish are top notch. Holds plenty of cash and the metal bar in the crease opens for easy access to bills.<br />Cons:<br />Pockets are tight and a little small. They will only hold 3 per side comfortably.  A little pricey.<br />Overall, I would recommend this wallet if you are looking at a front pocket wallet."
4.0,"Shirt had nice design and material is thin, but fine for warm climate areas. I didn't particularly like the way the bottom was made, too short and a little big around."
4.0,"I ordered size XXL and I'm NOT a really large woman (wear size large or medium in tops). I found it to be a bit snug but not so much as to make it too uncomfortable -- so don't order your usual size. However, I like that I don't have to deal with hooks digging into my back and straps that leave impressions on my shoulders at the end of the day."
4.0,"I have had several pairs of Minnetonkas over the years; this is the first pair that have not been a good fit.  My normal size is 6B which I ordered for this pair.  Probably should have listened to other reviewers that advised ordering a half size larger, as these are a little snug for me.  Size 61/2 probably would have fit better.  However, I put a pair of shoe stretchers in these for a couple of days, and that did help, so I did not send them back."
4.0,Looks just like the photo but it is a bit big but great in length does not roll up. Good price would recommend but my plus size beauties.
4.0,"The Wife likes it, though the fabric is a bit thin for her. She wears regular pants over it to keep warm. The fit was very good."
4.0,It goes on your finger
4.0,"I have used coolibar swimming apparel before and they always stand up well. This swimming top is cute, the color is beautiful especially for the summer and has been holding up well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because it‚Äôs on the loose end."
4.0,Either I've lost weight or it runs a little big... but all in all - just as I had expected..
4.0,"The fabric is quality and not cheap.  The moon phases are only on by a sticker, so i worry they will peal off.  It runs small/tight fit."
4.0,"This is small.  So forget it if you are male or don‚Äôt have small face.  It really doesn‚Äôt cover under your chin.  I didn‚Äôt want big fabric mask so this works just fine for me.  Strange odor first couple of time even after wash but on 3rd time wash, it went away.  I honestly enjoy variety colors, soft, right, and easy breathing.  It‚Äôs under $6 a set.  It‚Äôs pretty good deal."
4.0,"The dress is amazing! Makes my hips look more full and is the right amount of shinny to reflect the sun and make you glow. Only down side is the seam was a little off on the side, and the adjustable straps twist in themselves and get stuck. Other than that nothing but compliments"
4.0,"The dress I ordered was the long black gown. I purchased this dress for a trip to Vegas next summer.  Material is a tad bit itchy., due to all the sequins, but bearable. The underskirt of the dress is nude, not black (it looked black to me in the picture) , so be mindful of that. Dress fit somewhat as expected, but the dip in the back and area near the chest will have to be altered to fit my body, it doesn't fit as snugly as it does on the model in the picture. I ordered a Label M, US Small size. I am 5'3 and 128 lbs. The dress basically fits, I will just have to get the sides and back taken in. Overall a good buy and cant wait to wear it next year."
4.0,One cool ass bag !! 4 stars as one zip is stuck and useless !!
4.0,"I figured it would be small but its really small, I suppose that's why its so cute. It reflects light very beautifully and shows many different colors. Its about the size of a dime, which i wished it was bigger but its not for me. However, if I can find a good chain to put it on, I may buy one for myself. All in all, its a very cute little gem that i recommend for anyone who needs a sweet gift. (I got it for my mom by the way and will see how she likes it in a couple hours.)"
4.0,"The material is different from the real shirts, but I like how it feels. Size chart is accurate, it fit me well. Had some loose thread, but that's the only problem I had. I'm 5'1, 100lbs. Ordered the med."
4.0,Only downside to this item so that they don‚Äôt glow in the dark very well. You have to use a flashlight to even get them to glow. No normal light exposure during the day makes them glow at night.
4.0,"Product is alright, a little bit smaller than I wanted but fit better with more wear."
4.0,"I like the temple socks, does a decent job of protecting the back of my ears, but they will not stay on when I pull my glasses off. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt give it a 5. I definitely have the right size, but they do slide off."
4.0,Very pretty but breaks easily. Great price and good to find a chain that's actually part of the navel ring.
4.0,They are comfortable. But they don't offer a large by it self. So the large/extra large is a little big but the small/medium id's too small for my pkg.
4.0,The band is to tight to fit all the way up my thy. I‚Äôm a size 9 in jeans and it fits just above the knee without making my leg look like a roll
4.0,"Love the design, not quite the shininess and the noise they make, will be wearing to informal occasions"
4.0,"Was very well made, just the right coverage and support"
4.0,very nice needed a size large i got x large true to size .may order more after see how they hold up after a few washing.
4.0,"Bought for my 2 year old, who admittedly has a big head. They are still too big for her. We will be saving them for next summer.<br /><br />Other than that, very cute! And when we wore them last night for a walk and they fell off, I ran them over with the stroller and they didn't budge. So definitely durable for the active toddler!"
4.0,My 3 year old daughter only asked for Fairy dust to christmas! I think I will reinforce the lid but this might just work.
4.0,i really love the scarf its very thin and fit to where any season of the year even summer
4.0,"Comfortable, fits well, and looks nice."
4.0,They are comfortable they fit well but have some problems selecting cell phone screen apps.  They are warm but not for temperatures from 30¬∞ and down.
4.0,It's beautiful but... When I got it some strings and all were hanging off. And the headband had some too I don't want to cut them off and ruin the costume. But it sure was nice.
4.0,My son loved it and is very comfy.
4.0,"The outfit is beautiful made if light cotton material, the pants fit snug,as well as the shirt that goes under the top cape. The cap although is very large, but it flows beautifully. Just iron it out with steam on medium heat, not hot! So it fits me ok, I'm a chest 44 ,waist 36 and 6ft tall 205Lbs and I got a 2XXLG which fits"
4.0,Really cute glasses and little stiff but for the price I think they're great.
4.0,Very cute. It fits good. I like it.
4.0,Very cheap fabric and the lowest quality ballet dress you can find in the flea market. the size runs larger and I am very disappointed by how bad the material is.
4.0,"It's a great shirt but I found it to be a bit small, no worries though I love the shirt! It's a shirt people, not a kidney."
4.0,"I did not realize how causual these are by the picture.  They look like bedroom slippers, but they feel like slippers too, which is nice."
4.0,These are really cute but they are very large!
4.0,"Vibrant royal Blue color as shown and once on, fabric and construction show very beautifully. Beware side cut on top is narrow so if you have larger breasts (I'm a 36C), dress will show some side boob, but hey for a warm summer day or beach vacation nothing wrong with that! Just saying it's probably not family bbq attire. Beware slit is actually front center, not on side a appears in pictures. Elastic under chest and wrap around to back is stretchy so sizing runs a bit large and curious to see how it holds up after a few washes. Length more high ankle/ low calf, wishing was a bit longer. I'm 5'7'', 165lbs, ordered L and easily could have sized down to M.  Would exchange but worried top on a M ends up with too much bob exposure and even shorter length. Lastly halter ties have light blue, dark blue yarn tassels at end which I love the extra detail of."
4.0,"This was a great watch, however it seems much bigger around on the face of the watch than expected. Too big for wrist"
4.0,Delivered promptly and were exactly as described
4.0,"G-kid's present, very nice quality for $"
4.0,Pieces are thin but work well together
4.0,Lovely but not for me. I returned it.
4.0,I'm very sure this trimmer will make a difference for me
4.0,This bolero is too cute. I paired it with the Darth Vader headband that I also bought on Amazon.  I wore this to Hollywood Studios Florida. My only complaint is the neck piece that Velcro‚Äôs the bolero shut was bothersome on my neck. It kept rubbing my neck and almost rubbed it raw. I took it off before that happened.
4.0,I haven't had the chance to really wear them yet but it fits pretty well. I got a medium and was afraid it would be a little to baggy but its not. Its more of a gray then it looks like in the picture; I also bought the dark grey on and  it also fits as expected. Great for the price and will be good to wear in the summer.
4.0,I liked it. It is a nice product
4.0,Slightly large in the bust area and short with a petticoat but the material<br />Is nice and the craftsmanship is good.
4.0,I would like to have the armor for the jacket please help
4.0,"Runs a little large, and you get what you pay for.  With that said I like the length of it and the style."
4.0,Great handy belt to own.
4.0,"This is a very nice suit.  I took off one star since I had to do some alterations to make the bust fit properly...a M turned out to have waaaay too much room in the bust.  I had to cut the cups down quite a bit to fit my 36C.  If you're bigger on top, though, it should be perfect."
4.0,Bought this for my husband to replace his heavy plastic watchband.  Once you figure out how it works - no problems!
4.0,"Comfy! I gave it 4 stars because of the length that is a bit too long (I'm 5ft 3in) and the pockets suck, they are too small. My phone and keys fallout."
4.0,"This costume is awesome! Very comfortable and despite the tights looking *very* small, they fit. My hat was ripped but it arrived 3 days before Halloween so there was no way to get a fix for that with only a few days to spare."
4.0,"but for some reason, the tie dye and print ones seem to run smaller, and have less stretch, than the solid color ones.  I have this is 4 colors, and 2 of the tie dye ones, and both of the tie dye ones fit smaller and have less stretch."
4.0,"Nice, well made dress. It was longer than expected which was great. It would be perfect for taller girls. I was easily able to shorten it to the perfect length."
4.0,"I was looking for a laptop bag for work that had room for a few folders...but was cute and inexpensive. This bag is perfect, and I LOVE the color...the purple is more on the blue-grey side, which makes it more neutral but more interesting than black or brown.<br /><br />Updated: the bag straps have started to deteriorate but it's been over a year (and I take it every day to work) so for the price, I'm happy with that. I ordered the &#34;mauve&#34; color as a replacement and it's really like a springy purple-pink, not like the picture...since its Oct I'll wait till spring to use it."
4.0,Bought this in a medium (my usual size) and had to exchange for a large just for the length.  Love to pair this sweatshirt with high wasted leggings and joggers.  Gives a casual look a cute touch.
4.0,"Great shoes!  Other reviews said they fit small, so I ordered a size larger.  I could have stayed with my correct size though because I have a lot if room in them.  I'm not reurning them though because I couldn't wait to take them for a &#34;spin.&#34;<br /><br />Don't forget to buy the clip attachment too!"
4.0,Next time ill buy one size down but it looks good was just slipping a little.
4.0,"My optician encourages me to wear wide sunglasses for added protection against cataracts. I was wearing sunglasses that attach to the sides of the my prescription glasses; these are sooooooo much more convenient.  I was surprised at how securely they fit. I'd love, however, to find a pair of flip-up clip-ons with a 3&#34; lens..."
4.0,"My 14-year-old daughter wanted to try some new jewelry, so I got this for her as one of her birthday gifts. It has turned out to be even better than expected.<br /><br />The necklace was delivered in great condition. It's packaged in a cardboard box, which has a lovely sky-blue color. Inside, the necklace is mounted on shiny material that unfolds for a unique presentation. This makes for a nice gifting experience.<br /><br />My first impression of this necklace was immediately positive. The gold has a lovely color, and the chain looks like it's made well. The pearls look good enough. Upon close inspection, I can see that the pearls don't have a totally ""natural"" appearance. I've seen a number of other pearls at this price point with more believable coloration. However, you do need to look pretty closely to notice this. In my opinion, for most circumstances, this necklace makes an appearance that's a notch above its price point.<br /><br />The chain adjusts in length easily, and the clasp closes securely. My daughter has worn it all day, including in active situations, and it has not come loose.<br /><br />This is a nice enough necklace. The gold looks good. The pearls aren't going to fool an expert, but they are fine for most casual uses. I recommend it."
4.0,They arrived on time and fit just as expected. Couldn't ask for more.
4.0,"These were super cute and medium construction quality. I don't expect them to last longer that 2 years, but the price was right. And my kiddo was the cutest little reindeer on stage."
4.0,"Not a bad dress, size is as indicated.  Not a bad design, very simple, cover all flaws, and doesn‚Äòt see through. But, it is 100% polyester as stated on the label, and came with lots of end threads hanging around that need to be trimmed off. It is &#34;washed&#34;, the lighter areas are located in mid section, not a preferred area."
4.0,This girl's dress just screams fall. It is made with thicker material and is so soft to the touch. I love the plaid and is great with leggings and boots.
4.0,"The fabric is a little see-through, but I wanted something light weight so it's a good compromise."
4.0,"Ordered a L and I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 135 lbs, medium build, 36B.  The pants are amazing but the top is very narrow and with the button area at the top being faux, there is no extra room available.<br />Such a pity, had to return.  The fabric and print is so lovely and happy - a very delightful set."
4.0,got to give as gift
4.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but I didn't like how baggy it looked on me.  I am about 5'2 120# and ordered the small.  It does appear that is how it is supposed to be worn, but it didn't work for me.  It is a super cute dress and great color though."
4.0,This fit my daughter slightly large. Not too bad where I had to order smaller though
4.0,"Overall I really like it but it was kinda big for me and I normally wear 7 1/8 - 7 1/4. I've noticed that most products like this don't seem to have much information and you have to go by reviews. The problem with that is some say it was too small, some it was too big, but very few give their normal size so that people have some kind of reference. I've also noticed some people just like to complain and would do so even if it fit them perfectly."
4.0,Fits great and is comfy
4.0,"I love the feel of this sweater, I love the pockets and style, but the under arm area makes me think I should have ordered an x-small? Or maybe it's supposed to be really big here, either way Its cute and very comfortable."
4.0,"I got this watch for my husband for our anniversary. He loves it! It fits his wrist perfectly and it doesn‚Äôt look tiny next to his big hand (which was a concern). He‚Äôs usually very hard on his watches at his job so the ‚Äúscratch resistant‚Äù face was a deciding factor of this particular watch. Unfortunately, after the first day the band did have a scratch on it, but at least it wasn‚Äôt the face (which is why I gave it a 4). He also loved that it comes with a spare battery."
4.0,Cheap price cute style...it's VERY hot pink
4.0,Love this soft fabric. I love it!
4.0,"I am a person that reads every single review before I purchase, and I have to say this dress was true to the reviews. The material is a little weird- almost like a house dress from the 70's(think Mrs. Roper), it looks like it should flow, but its a little stiff. The neckline really plunges, true to other reviewer's pics, but I just sewed it up a few stitches and it hid my strapless bra just fine. I ordered it in cream, but its more like white. Despite this odd review, I really like this dress and can't wait to wear it."
4.0,Shipping took forever and the clothes were way smaller than they should be
4.0,"Let me start by saying the color of this blue glasses is beautiful but the packaging of this item was not so good.. It was put in a plastic bag with a label taped to it. Fortunately the sunglasses were not damaged or out of shape during shipping.  They came with a black pouch to keep the glasses when not in use.<br />The glasses themselves have all the features I wanted, metal frame and thin glass lenses.<br />These sunglasses are very functional and work in all sun conditions. The lens are made of plastic and the shade of the lens are alright. Please note these are non-polarized.<br /><br />The frame style is not what I really had in mind but they didn't look bad on my face. Besides these kind of glasses seem to be the rage with the youngsters.<br />As for the clarity of the lens, somehow for me they don't seem quite as clear as it should be. Overall a okay pair for everyday use and  cost less than $10.<br /> I received this product during a promotional discount in exchange for my fair and honest review. All thoughts are 100% my own and reflect my own personal experiences with the product. My reviews are always honest on how I feel about the product and discounts or samples provided to me for testing purposes do not influence my reviews!"
4.0,"These came up under my search for menstrual panties and I thought they would serve that purpose. I should have read more into the details, but they were not what I expected in that sense. However, I do wear these as every day underwear (the intended purpose) and they are extremely comfortable and well made. Just thought I‚Äôd write a review for someone else who was like me and didn‚Äôt read too into it!"
4.0,"Sweater took a month to come. is somewhat small/narrow. Soft acrylic, washed and hung dry well. Style is nice"
4.0,"Held up great. I used this band for over a year, but like any leather band it does start to smell."
4.0,My new crossbody purse wears nicely.  I love the style
4.0,"I love these sandals! They fit so well and is snug and comfy on my feet. It's not uncomfortable at all and is surprisingly soft. The only problem I had was that the bottom of the sandals are a tad slippery. Other than that, I like them! 4 stars!"
4.0,Very nice socks.
4.0,They seem to run a little big but other than that I like it
4.0,it broke I'm sending it back  üò£üò¢  its a decent bracelet  want to exchange it thank you
4.0,Size was important and the bracelet was perfect in size. Complete the look I was going for
4.0,"Very pretty, the band is a bit misshapen on the palm side"
4.0,"These are great for my tragus piercing. As the picture shows, the little stud head screws into the post and it is TRICKY to line it up if you're putting them in yourself and I think the post is a little too long for my liking, but otherwise these are great. I've been wearing them non-stop for a couple of months now and I just have to make sure to tighten them once in a while."
4.0,This is a unique little (the only downside . . . smaller than expected) piece. My daughter loves it which is all that matters :)
4.0,"I was a little confused when I ordered this for my little sister. It says Men's in the title but also youth; so, it was a little confusing for me. It was a youth size and it fit my sister perfect."
4.0,Pretty thin plastic
4.0,"Size is right on, super comfy and cute"
4.0,Great for my shoes. Helps keep them in shape.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 115 pounds.  Even though the size chart said I was a small, other reviews indicated I should go larger.  So I ordered a medium. It fit well.  I ordered another dress in a different print but a small size.  While I could fit in it, it was tight and not flattering.  I returned it and got another medium‚Äîmuch more comfortable and flattering. I also wish the waist was not so high."
4.0,THIS WAS A NICE BRACELET THANK YOU. FAST SHIPPING.
4.0,"Gave this to my son-in-law as a gift and he really likes it. Looks sharp, but the stopwatch does not work. I noticed someone else said their's did work. That is the only reason I did not do 5-stars."
4.0,I ended up sizing up two sizes after reading reviews and it‚Äôs still a bit tight. Otherwise it‚Äôs a cute suit and the material was comfortable.
4.0,"The sunglasses came packaged very nicely.  They came inside a pouch with a drawstring, complete with a cleaning cloth.  They are very handsome shades with adequate protection from the sun.  I purchased the green tint...I was underwhelmed by the green and thought they'd be greener.  Overall, a great pair of sunglasses!  I look forward to trying the other tints out soon!"
4.0,"Jacket exactly what I wanted. Light weight, fit is perfect and color is soft."
4.0,"Very nice leather gloves, warm fuzzy inside.  Come in a beautiful slide out sturdy glove box.  Fit long in the fingers."
4.0,"Really super cute. Bought it as a Christmas gift. It was a bit tight on her, but still fit nicely. Just not as &#34;loose&#34; as expected."
4.0,"I got a medium in this dress, I'm 5'5 130 lb and it fits good. It shows major side boob but I'm wearing a bandeau under for a family dinner, if I was just going out with friends it would be fine. Slit comes up kind of high as well. It's what expected for the price"
4.0,"When you first open the package, you'll see that this is VERY large.  It's one size fits all, and it's quite big.  However, due to the way it drapes and the ruffles along the side, and also the drawstring at the waist, it's actually good-looking when you put it on.  It was still bigger than what I would have chosen if different sizes were offered, but I would have had no qualms wearing it.  After I washed and dried it, I was delighted to find it had shrunk to a much better size for me.  This may be good news for you or bad news.  If you don't want it to shrink, be advised that it will if you put it in the dryer.  However, you can line-dry it and it will work just fine.  The garment itself is cute and very attractive when you put it on.  Also, after washing/drying, there was very little wrinkling.  I think this is a great choice for a beach coverup."
4.0,"Yes, I bought an authentic Jacobs Quilted Venetia in caramel.  It's well made and beautiful but I find it to be very heavy !  I am probably going to have to sell it on ebay at a lost because It's just to darned heavy.  I prefer lighter bags. Because of the weight I limit what I put in it so I have a big, beautful nearly empty bag."
4.0,It looks nothing like the picture. It's very thin and the pattern is much smaller than pictured. I did get complements on it.
4.0,"I ordered a size bigger & it still fits a bit tight, but otherwise very comfortable."
4.0,It is very pretty and classy<br />The only problem was untangling it when received
4.0,Nice cap to stay cool help Reflect the Sun off of Head
4.0,"The zipper is too far long and the fabric wasn‚Äôt preshrunk, so it looks a little silly/awkward."
4.0,The back was a little low but it came on time and fit well.
4.0,Key Chain is well made and strong.
4.0,The picture made the colors seem a bit more muted than they are. The purple is pretty close but the flowers are a hot pink instead of the dusty rose pink they appear in the picture. Still love it. Maybe it will fade some after a wash.
4.0,I loved the size and weight of this item it was exactly what I had wanted the only problem I had was the rope part kept untieing and I was unable to retie it otherwise it was a good purchase.
4.0,"This penguin was much liked by my wife and daughters, who are not really<br />jewelry people.  [Good break for me right?]  It sold out fast in<br />Amazon too!"
4.0,I love this it holds money phone cards and 1lip gloss this is great
4.0,"this dress is good quality for the price. the back is a bit see through so as long as you wear shorts under it, it is perfect for a cheap costume"
4.0,"This bag is nicely made.  The material feels strong and seems like it can hold up to a lot of wear and tear.<br /><br />The interior of the bag is divided in two sections by a zipper, which is useful for separating clean from dirty clothes, or toiletries from clothes, etc.<br /><br />There are a good number of pockets.  The front has a picket in the middle, and top.  The interior has the aforementioned divided section as well as some organization pockets.<br /><br />The three-way travel is just a top handle, a side handle, or by using the back pack straps.  I like that the straps can be neatly placed in their own compartments to keep them out of the way if you are not using them.<br /><br />It can carry a 15 inch laptop in a very nicely padded section.  If you are the type of person who puts stickers on their laptop, the tag is actually a sticker you can peel off.<br /><br />I wish this bag was a little larger.  It doesn't expand.<br /><br />Overall, this is a high quality bag, but I don't see ever getting more than one overnight's stay worth of clothes in it."
4.0,As described. It's perfect.
4.0,Great hat! I love it so much. Good quality and strong wool to keep out of my face. Fits well around my head.
4.0,"The arch where the beer bottle opener is located is pretty stiff and my feet took some getting used to, but in the long run they feel good and have held up well like all my Reef sandals."
4.0,Item is very good quality but return shipping cost was not disclosed ahead of time on sellers page. I bought multiple sizes to ensure fit.  Item has a relaxed oversized fit and good for tall gals.
4.0,Bracelet broke after one use. Hat too big but can be tied down.
4.0,"Smaller than I thought they would be, but very pretty!"
4.0,"Nice evening jacket. Love the green velvet. A little too short for me, but I'm outside my return window."
4.0,Beautiful! I am so very pleased with the color and feel of these. They are lightweight enough for Spring or Fall and look lovely. I purchased during a lightning sale so the price was exceptional!
4.0,"The vest is great, good quality"
4.0,Like the extra pockets.
4.0,Loved the look but the boot is a little stiff. Great in the snow.
4.0,"It is perfect for the summer for my wife to add to her collection, we got to the lake or beach very often and some time several days in a row so she like to have a selection and not wear the same one.  This one is very thin and is ment to be what it is a cover up but not a dress.  She says for the price the quality is matching and it is a good deal and a nice addition to the collection and will serve its purpose well.  I would not say its an a grade product but still a very fair buy. For the sake of disclosure to those of who are reading, I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My ultimate goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not to advertise the product for the manufacturer to increase sales. My only hope is to write an insightful review that brings truth to each individual as a consumer of this product, as I will only leave the star value that I feel it is worth. Once again I give a fair and true review if I don‚Äôt like the product I will say so.<br />Product Description as below:<br />This beach wear is perfect look for a day on the beach and the fabric is semi-sheer and slightly see through.<br />It's easy to wear and will look sexy and fashion swimsuit cover-up for sun protect on the beach.<br />Various wearing styles - A sarong is one of the most useful beach essentials to have. Aside from adding color and flair to your beach fashion, its functionality and versatility also allows it to be used in other ways. Such as wear as a side-slit dress, draped dress, bandeau cascade dress, toga dress, wrap dress, jumpsuit...<br />Material :Polyester<br />Size: One size"
4.0,"Cutre top.  I usually wear Medium, but Large fit nice."
4.0,"I got this because I'm Irish and I love the moon. I really like the four leaf clover. That's my favorite part. The moon I think looks a bit cartoonish. It looked nicer in the pic but I still like it. I've been wearing it ever since I got it, so about a week. It has not brought me much luck this week tho. Maybe I should take it off. Decent quality. I like the dainty silver chain."
4.0,"The boots look just as expected, they are just a little bit bigger than expected."
4.0,Very thin and more transparent than my other leggings but work great with my dresses for spring.
4.0,"I personally love these shorts, even for post partum wear when nothing else seems to be comfortable. The only thing I was disappointed about was that the darker heather gray short is see through. Other than that they are extremely comfortable and the pockets on the sides come in super handy and are decently deep enough to hold your phone, wallet, keys, etc."
4.0,I love the convience of going from Uke to uke. Only downfall I have is the worry of scratching my instrument
4.0,"Honestly it‚Äôs a fun hat to wear. For me personally, it felt a little tight on the sides but that‚Äôs just me. Over than that, it‚Äôs a good product."
4.0,"The quality isn't as good as I thought it would be, but for now it is working. I purchased it because I had a D&B wallet that was very similar and I haven't been able to find one since. Until this one. The zipper isn't the best, the faux leather is okay quality. I would buy again for this price but not anything more."
4.0,Great colors and prints
4.0,Yellow = super super see through!
4.0,"This dress is so comfortable, and just the PERFECT shade of bright coral to get anyone in the mood for an early morning flight during spring break!<br />I‚Äôm deducting a star because the slip should have been flowing, like the dress itself, instead of form fitting because it always rises up while you‚Äôre walking.<br />The dress feels a little bigger than a usual Large, but considering I‚Äôm dieting, it could also be that I‚Äôm shifting between sizes.<br />Overall a very pretty dress and while the slip is a little annoying, I‚Äôd still buy it again."
4.0,It's nice to wear
4.0,Super cozy. They get nice and warm but only when plugged in. They immediately cool off once unplugged. They are really cute.
4.0,really nice pocket squares and great customer service.
4.0,"Love the dress! While I received the package very quickly, mine unfortunately arrived with a rip on the front...BUT I contacted the seller and she was VERY kind and helpful!! The dress is a little bit longer than I expected, so I will not be wearing it for the event I purchased for, but it is still very flattering in all the right places (I'll just wear it to a different event than I originally anticipated)! For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, around 130 lb and I purchased the small and it fits perfectly. The top part is very stylish and I love the way it makes my shoulders look. I will post a picture shortly."
4.0,"Nice color, Soft, keep warm but the fibers come off."
4.0,Awesome shirts. Keeps me cool during the summer. Like the slim fit feel to it.
4.0,"I am 5'0"" and the dress is way to long, almost to my ankles. Little big in the chest. 34D bought Med. Do not want to go through send the dress back but I will have to cut off at least 6"" to wear the dress."
4.0,"Very pretty and breathable fabric. It's a tiny bit big, but I'm rather small."
4.0,Great vest. Good quality
4.0,Good product but colors not as vibrant  as advertised
4.0,"I do like this dress overall and will be keeping it. But, some things to note.<br /><br />Cotton is the thinner kind, similar to a bed sheet. It's not the thick stretchy kind of.knit; it's more of a stretch woven.<br /><br />There are 2 seams on the torso; at the waist and underbust, that go around the back. The zipper catches at both seams ans made it very difficult to zip up. So I had to pull it up past both seams and then put on over my head to get it on.<br /><br />I also don't like the little puff on the sleeves at the shoulder. I know how to sew so I'll be fixing it myself, but just keep that in mind.<br /><br />As said, I will be keeping this dress but just be aware before you purchase."
4.0,fun and cute can be worn as necklace as well
4.0,"Looked great ,nicely made (do recommend hand held steamer comes in really wrinkled )"
4.0,Runs a bit short but very comfy.
4.0,I love the comfort yet stylish look of these jeans
4.0,"Works on watch a little small, hard to get on."
4.0,"As the name says, a classic. Good, simple, inexpensive watch. The band is short but should make it around most wrists."
4.0,"I was pleased with this item.  Fit as expected, no quality issues, good length as is but also adjustable.  Also, adjustable straps and good fit around the bust."
4.0,"Water bottle is cheapish and not &#34;Hello Kitty&#34; branded, but it still works. We use a better Hello Kitty water bottle. The pencil case, backpack and lunchbox are all pretty good. The bow fell off the backpack on day 2 of school but no matter, my daughter still loves this set. I like that her bento box can fit into the lunchbox with a juice box too."
4.0,"Very cute!! It‚Äôs has a great fit, looks nice, and Definitely Worth the pay! Great price for what u get"
4.0,I purchased these shorts for my teenage daughter. She loves them.  They are cute and just the right size for her.
4.0,"Read a review on here that said the dress was long on a girl who was tall. Beware...the dresses may vary in size...because the dress I received today was not long enough. It would be perfect for a person 5'7&#34; or shorter. Not for tall girls. I'm 6 ft and it's almost 7 inches shorter. I was really hoping for it to be longer in fact, I bought it solely because it was rated by another purchaser as good for tall girls. That was not accurate. But...it is very pretty. Beautiful pattern. Great style. Just super shorter than expected. üò¢"
4.0,"I love the style, but the elastic on the arms made the fit a bit too small for me."
4.0,I should have paid more attention to the size description. It was much larger than I thought it was going to be! It is as it states. I wanted something smaller so I guess the rating should be 5 stars the error was me not reading the size.
4.0,Love the glasses. However I ordered the grey and was sent the purple.
4.0,The size is smaller than I expected. Comfortable to wear ...
4.0,"Good jersey overall. Use them for mountain biking. Not good for cold days since they are very thin, but they are not designed to keep you warm, but just the opposite. They dry very fast which is also nice. I like the understated look as well. Mine is a little smaller in size than I expected and I should have gone with one size bigger, but they do stretch so I can still wear them so I am keeping them."
4.0,"Sleeves are bracelet length on me. I can hem and make them a less weird length. Everything else fits great. Gathering below bust is very flattering, hits at and just below knee. I'm 5'11"" and 175#, bought size large."
4.0,Decent quality. The cups are padded and the front is lined but the back isn't not sure if that will work for lighter colors once it gets wet. I'm 5'4&#34; 135 lbs I ordered the 2XL=8-10 us size. I choose to size up due to having larger butt/hips/thighs. It fits great and as expected except for the top the gathering in the top is a little odd looking due to me not having bigger than B cups. The top and padded cups fit I just don't have enough to make it stretch out to make the gathered part look right. I'll find a way to fix that. But for the price paid the quality it decent and it's very cute.
4.0,Cute but had discoloration on top
4.0,It's cute. My gf loves it.
4.0,But will keep and order more in the next size up.
4.0,A bit big but I will keep and use in my pool because it is comfortable
4.0,Very nice looking. Thinking of purchasing another to give as gift.
4.0,Works and fits like expected.
4.0,"I‚Äôm between sizes so I went up a size, fit is a little large but that was to be expected"
4.0,"My second sweater from this vendor and it doesn't disappoint.  Fabric is soft to the body, length is perfect to wear with tights or boy shorts.  Sexy and well made.  Price is unbeatable!  Sleeves are a little snug but purposely so, they stay in place.  I will be buying more..."
4.0,Beautiful well matched pearls. High quality . It would be nice if posts were a little longer and thicker. The butterfly backs should be larger for the price of AAAA rating.
4.0,"Bought these for my Barre classes. They are great! The first time I wore them, I felt they were a little roomy and shifted on certain movements, but after a washing/drying they were just right."
4.0,Looks nice. really like the engraving
4.0,For the price it was pretty cute.
4.0,"My son loves these, they don't look cheap at all"
4.0,I normally wear a medium and bought a large I love the fit but the sleeves are a little shorter than I would like them when cuffed to show the polka dots.... Overall nice shirt
4.0,"Great product, unfortunately runs pretty small"
4.0,Fit her perfectly.  Only problem was the hoop was broken.  So I just removed it.
4.0,"Very stylish and they match most everything. I bought them to wear this summer with a sun dress but have worn them with jeans, shorts etc."
4.0,My nephew loved them!! Only negative: one sock was sewn wrong by big toe and it rubbed his toe wrong. I ordered another pair bc he loved them and haven't been able to check them yet. Overall he thought they were Awesome!
4.0,It is exactly what it looks like it is online. Fairly good product. Hate having a big wallet and this allows me to minimize that and also have easy access. Cards and cash stay in place well too.
4.0,Cozy and warm. Love the color!
4.0,Pretty just a bit shorter than expected but heavy and as described.
4.0,"The connector to disconnect the lanyard broke but not to the point where it won't lock.  So, I'm still able to use it"
4.0,Si me gusto
4.0,GREAT PRODUCT BOUGHT A SECOND SET BUT WOULD LIKE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
4.0,"I like these glasses, they look good and have held up well as I don't tend to baby my glasses so that is why I buy low priced sunglasses. They do have a hologram type reflection when wearing in bright sunlight off other bright reflection surfaces which is odd but other than that they are good for the price."
4.0,Queda peque√±o para una talla 10 - 12. Ni√±a normal no gordita.
4.0,The strap is too long. But still looks cute..
4.0,Nice product. A bit tighter/smaller than I expected. Still pretty nice overall. Fast shipping.
4.0,"We did not use this raincoat as yet, however they fit very well and feel Lke they could be worn in light or heavy rains.<br /> Nice rain coats."
4.0,I use this dress for cruises. I like it very much but was surprise that the manufacturer recommended dry cleaning. I got a black one so the color isn‚Äôt an issue for me. I do like this dress.
4.0,I really like them<br /> The silvery parts near the lens on each side is kind of cheap looking but for the price andthe product it was great and the glasses  grew on me :)
4.0,The clasp broke but otherwise I like it
4.0,"So glamorous! Super sparkly, and with very high heel and platform that might take a little practice before I can wear them confidently and for long."
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable and nice looking. It's perfect for the office, not for wearing with jeans because of the ruffles going down the centre (which look bigger in person than in picture). It's just one piece that appears as two, so it's thin enough to wear in warmer weather and spring."
4.0,"I have been using this daily on my zenwatch 2 for about 3 weeks now. It is a nice product and it came with the tool to remove or add links. I would recommend this product, especially at the price I paid (like 13 bucks, silver band) the only con would be it adds a lot of weight to the watch."
4.0,It is a beautiful band and looks amazing. Unfortunately in my case it ended up being too big for my wrist. But it does look very nice!
4.0,The material is too thick for summer!
4.0,With age my hands have become so dry they crack. Although too big for my hands (size 6 glove) they have helped.
4.0,I liked the feel and comfort of the fabric. I didn't like it wasn't true to size because I normally wear a medium and ordered large which was too small. Gave to my daughter and she loves it.  This item didn't come in XL therefore I couldn't get for myself.
4.0,"I ordered this handbag for my wife, who has certain requirements for what a handbag should havel  She is very particular that a handbag have certain features, like a zippeered organizer for credit cards, etc.  I purchased the handbag only after she had given the ok!  She loves it!"
4.0,"nice shape,poor material."
4.0,"I liked the fact that the Amazon Fire Table also fits into this bag, very well.<br />It's a great concealer, very masculine, and the leather feels a little different from real leather; more like heavy supple leather.  So, waterproof leather does fits  the description of this bag."
4.0,"Comfortable, breathable, easy to put on & off, looks good"
4.0,No las quer√≠a blancas
4.0,"As a size 14 I was a little worried that an XL wouldn't fit. But this dress is very stretchy and does indeed fit just fine. The fabric is slightly sheer, so a slip or petticoat is recommended. My only issue with this item is that the skirt is WAY too long. It needs at least 6 inches hemmed off, and hits my lower calf with a petticoat underneath. For reference I'm 5'7."
4.0,"Mixed feelings on this one.  I was hoping to be able to attach my car key and other keys on opposite ends. Unfortunately, that makes it so long that the key drags back and forth on my leg while driving.  But, it is well-build and makes it easy to change keys out."
4.0,Cute little pin. Nice sentiment. Of the two pieces I received one was imperfect. The white color on the wing  was covering the metal details of the word Bee.
4.0,"Arrived promptly, was exactly as pictured. Nice weave to the material. Fit as expected."
4.0,These are a great product that gives my Pre-K class the ability to dress up and pretend to cook in my dramatic play center.
4.0,"I'm a 34DDD & wear med/lrg tops.<br />My girls turned into Blobfish several years ago. They literally look & behave like blobs. I ordered a large/pink & it fits great. The material is very soft, silky & comfy.<br />The only reason I rated it a 4, instead of 5, is that one of the pads (removable) was sort of mangled/crumpled & I couldn't smooth it out. It's very noticeable, even under a heavy top. And, whenever I get padded bras the pads are always too small. The pads (which seems to be standard in all the brands I've tried) are about the size of a C cup (?)  I took them out & it fits great without them. No buyer's remorse going on; however, if I was a C cup & got it with the pad(s) mangled I'd probably be annoyed."
4.0,"I haven‚Äôt upgraded to Plus, which gives you additional features.<br /><br />Make sure you understand that the item itself has no electronics and none of your medical data. Instead, emergency responders would need to scan your unique QR code (or use the URL, your unique ID info, or the Getmyid phone number). They then get your profile online.<br /><br />My EMT cousin assures me he‚Äôd find it. He says he‚Äôd prefer the phone number over the QR code so he can put the phone on speaker and keep both hands free. The company apparently doesn‚Äôt offer 24x7 phone coverage, so responders would have to use the QR code some of the time.<br /><br />It fits my Fitbit Charge 2 wristband snugly. It doesn‚Äôt slide around. This was my main reason for buying it, so I didn‚Äôt have to wear a medical bracelet in addition to my Fitbit.<br /><br />The setup was pretty easy. You can include as much info or as little as you want, well beyond what a normal medical bracelet would show. You can modify it at your convenience. I haven‚Äôt tried uploading documents, but I believe that‚Äôs only for paid Plus subscribers.<br /><br />You can set up two-factor authentication. This is an important feature for protecting the kind of private data you‚Äôd store in your profile.<br /><br />I haven‚Äôt worn it long enough to have any wear and tear, but it seems sturdy.<br /><br />Although it has several advantages over a simple medical bracelet, there are some risks to consider. You might consider these risks acceptable, but at least you‚Äôll be making an informed decision.<br /><br />Risks:<br /><br />Anyone who gains possession of your MyID sleeve can look up your info, just like an emergency responder.<br /><br />Any private info you store in your profile is on the company‚Äôs website. In security terms, they‚Äôre holding both PII (personally identifiable information) and PHI (protected health information). The website's privacy statement gives a general description of their security practices.<br /><br />There‚Äôs also an availability risk. Will the emergency responder have Internet access at the critical moment? Will the website be up and responsive? Does the company have resilient uptime mechanisms in place?<br /><br />There‚Äôs also the risk that the company will go out of business, or stop providing this service. You might live with your condition for another 20 years, for example, but will the company still be around then? Will you find out about it if they go under?<br /><br />I‚Äôm crossing my fingers on these risks."
4.0,"Updated review: there was a problem with the order - the wrong item came - and the seller corrected it quickly, and professionally. High marks for the seller.<br /><br />The pants themselves are not bad; a bit smaller than expected, and fit a bit more like women's pants than the jogger look in the photo. Comfy."
4.0,"Feel great, but I order a 9 the stamp on the sole said 10, so I had to cut them down. It didnt take long to cut them."
4.0,Second time I ordered these because I was so happy with them the first time
4.0,"I like the variations of color, they are very light and comfortable.<br />They are larger than I would like, but I like them very much."
4.0,Shrank a little more than expected. Couldn't find it in TALL.
4.0,"This hat looks fine, has good ventilation, and the brim is nicely flexible. As you would expect, it does a good job of keeping the sun off exposed skin. My only objection is that the crown basically collapses in on itself when you set it down, and it sometimes tries to do that while it's still on your head. The picture implies a level of stiffness that just doesn't exist. Not a deal-breaker, though; it's still a nice hat."
4.0,"These are pretty stylish sunglasses. They are rounder framed than traditional aviators, and have a more rounded nose piece as well. But, they do have a sleek look, the color is great, and they are not overly dark..just perfect for the average wear day or for driving.<br /><br />I actually ordered these for my son to try, who is an adult with a larger head..they do not work for someone with a large head. These also didn't work on my husband. But for a woman or a teen with a smaller head, they fit just right. They are also lightweight , which I really love. The frame does not seem super sturdy, so I would use these only in activities where there would not be a chance of breakage.<br /><br />I received this product for review and evaluation purposes. All opinions are my own and in no way influenced by the seller of this item. If my experience with this item changes over time, I will update this review. Thanks for reading!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm surprised no one said this in their reviews. The dress is gorgeous. It is a little lower cut in the clevage than I‚Äôd prefer but that is fine. The one thing you need to know is that you can see through this dress! I have brown skin and you could see all of my business under this dress. I didn't return it, I just ordered a full length camisole slip."
4.0,"Attractive watch.  So far, it keeps pretty good time.  Hard to see hands because of no or very little contrast to background.  Price is very good compared to other skeleton watches."
4.0,"Fabrics good. Super comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 210 lbs. It‚Äôs 4 inches shorter than I expected. It does not go all the way to the floor."
4.0,My dog loves these sunglasses.  Regularly grabs them off the table and bolts for the far end of the yard.  Had to take a star away because the lenses don't stand up to a dog's jaw strength.  I will be ordering more.  I hear they work on children's eyes as well.
4.0,I loved the dress because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù I have a hard time finding a dress that fits and I love!
4.0,"Great tank top, the only aspect I would change is the back. Overall nice material and front design."
4.0,My nephew love this. He wears it all these time.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very nice product for the price. Fits well and falls elegantly. However wrinkles when sitting, so then doesn‚Äôt look so good üòä But I like it!"
4.0,"True to size guide, pretty comfortable to wear to the gym."
4.0,"Super cool socks, lots of compliments. But, after the first wash, lost tons of color. Second wash not so bad, third wash, not as bad either. Would give 5  stars if kept color longer. Sweet socks though!!"
4.0,"Sooooo cute, only downfall are the stingy sleeves are super tight on the medium! May just cut it off, or start workin on my push ups haha"
4.0,Wish it was clear on both sides
4.0,This dress is cute and comfortable!
4.0,Bought these earrings for my 5 yr old for her aunts wedding as she's the flower girl and they are absolutely beautiful. I don't think they will be good for long term use in ear (for kids) as they dangle and the snap doesn't seem that strong.
4.0,Beautiful fit but little thin. . needed a slip underneath.
4.0,This is a great dress. Perfect for summer. I am usually a small and ordered an extra small and itvwas slightly too big but still fits fine.
4.0,"Good product, but it fits a bit small."
4.0,ultra lightweight bag.  used as an over night bag and carry on.  works great.  perfect for price.
4.0,"Good quality boot, nice soft fur. Dont love rhe soles... a little hard. Bit overall great fit! Perfect for the price"
4.0,I thought it was cool it served it‚Äôs purpose as a jacket more the. hoodie
4.0,Rubber holders will stretch a good amount but have a outgas odor for a few days. Works fine as a holder to drop your glasses down to your chest and quick ear mount. Or secure your frames behind your ears if you position them at the tips.
4.0,"YOU REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE ORDERING THIS.  YOU GET 7 RINGS FOR ABOUT 2 BUCKS.  I'M SURE IT WILL TARNISH SO KEEP AWAY FROM OILS, LOTIONS, AND WATER.  I LOVED IT.  WILL ORDER MORE TO GIVE AS GIFTS.  I HAVE LOST 2 SO FAR BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO CHEAP I WILL JUST BUY ANOTHER.  PLEASE DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH IT WAS CHEAP.  BUT THE QUALITY IS GOOD FOR THE PRICE AND WILL ORDER AGAIN.<br /><br />CON:  TAKES FOREVER.  BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?"
4.0,The quality of the sweater is really nice not ‚Äúcheaply‚Äù made. I would normally wear a small but after reading reviews I decided to go with a medium. The medium fits snug more like a small I could of definitely gotten a large. I will definitely order more of these in other colors
4.0,"I've never owned a corsets, so I am unfamiliar with the sizing requirements. After a lot of research, I chose to go with this one as a starter. Based on other feedback that this runs small, I chose a size XL. I typically run between a small and medium in regular sizing, so choosing an XL that isn't a youth size was difficult for me.<br /><br />It arrived today and I yanked it out of its package within moments of delivery. The material is thicker than I thought it would be and it felt decently made, especially for the price. The strings are like a shoelace, not the most attractive, but sturdy. The privacy panel is about 4&#34; wide, so there is plenty of opportunity to  go wider if you need to.<br /><br />After loosening the strings and wrapping it around me, I hooked the busk and proceeded to pull the strings as tight as they could go. It was too big. I am currently a 32D with a 30&#34; waist and this thing was just too big. I'm returning it for the next size down, possibly even the medium, but am satisfied with the construction and appearance of this corset."
4.0,"Is a lot shorter than I expected, with really long sleeves. Still nice and soft."
4.0,"Fitting is perfect, not loose or tight.<br />comfortability Is also good.<br />After using and washing/drying on the dryer, I‚Äôm surprised that it survived. It still looks like brand new.<br />Maybe because the material is similar to spandex.<br /><br />Panty liner does slide sometimes. I think thats normal.<br /><br />Price is reasonable."
4.0,This is a great shirt the only complaint I have is the product label in bright yellow on front of shirt
4.0,It so soft and exactly what i need.
4.0,- Fits perfect.<br />- Quality is good and feeel is good too. I expected feel to be like cotton but its like silk. However its not sweaty at all.<br />- For the price 9.99 its not bad at all. Its just a very good deal.
4.0,Add an AGD logo on the front and it would be perfect.
4.0,It looks just like the picture. NOT cheap looking or cheaply made. Very happy with this purchase
4.0,A little big and bulky but effective.
4.0,"Really comfy even when I have to wear them all day. Breathe well for warm-weather workouts, and look professional. Compression isn't quite as tight as I'd expect from ""high compression"" - you might want to go a size smaller than normal"
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a bit short.  Above my ankle.
4.0,"The sleeve material is different, I would prefer it was cotton like the shirt. The design is cute and festive."
4.0,Muy buena  elecci√≥n
4.0,This costume was awesome. But almost too small.pay attention to the size.
4.0,"From the pictures I couldn't tell if it was a really dark blue or black. But when it came, to me at least, it looks like a really dark blue. It's super cute though and super comfy"
4.0,"Sent the wrong thing the first time, but got a full refund and reordered. Second one fit the description and it's wonderful. Good quality, too."
4.0,"I really like this piece.  It looks old and it's just the right length (mid breast-bone).  It took a bit of time arriving, but for the price I didn't mind."
4.0,"I am a soft size 14/hard size 16, wear a large or extra large depending on cut and stole of the shirt (I'm a 40 ddd/42 dd).  This dress is light, comfortable, and easy to wear.  I bought it to go to a festival and it worked really well.  Beware it is see through, but a really nice dress for the price."
4.0,Very cute!  Just as pictured
4.0,"I added an extender to this and like it better at a longer length, but the quality seems very good (the finish hasn't worn at all yet it anything) and I get compliments on this all the time! I bought it for a wedding, but it ended up being a great versatile piece that I wear all the time"
4.0,Fits true to size.  Bought for a 9 year old for Easter. She loves it and can‚Äôt wait to wear it.  Totally worth the under $20 that I paid for it.
4.0,My wife loves it. Its short and some a$$ cheeks hang out. but it looks nice on her.
4.0,Thin but worked fine with a long tank top underneath. Can‚Äôt beat the price
4.0,"Fabric and color are good, I was expecting an A line  fit. The waistline tapers in quite a bit. If you want it to be loose order a size or two up."
4.0,"I actually loved this dress!  I purchased it for an all white event and was very happy I did.  The only reason for the 4 stars is because of the type of material, the pockets looked odd when I put the dress on.  Hard to describe but you could see the pocket through the dress if that makes sense.  I ended up removing my pockets and it turned out perfectly. Oh yeah, I also removed the thread in the cuff so it wasn‚Äôt permanently cuffed.  Liked the longer sleeve better."
4.0,"These jeans have a ‚Äúblasted‚Äù look down the front, and also in spots on the back.  You‚Äôll notice an oblong imprint on the back left pocket, which is indeed on the jeans.  It reminds me of a round can imprint when guys dip snuff, but this oblong.  The listing shoes it‚Äôs supposed to represent a wallet, but I don‚Äôt find that to be the case at all, as it‚Äôs much too small.<br /><br />These jeans are made of 98% cotton and 2% elastane.  So there is a slight bit of stretch all over, but not a lot.  There is very little stretch in the waist.  The fabric is heavy denim that‚Äôs not too stiff.  These jeans are Made in China, so at the current price of seventy-eight bucks, they are quite pricey, but overall I like them."
4.0,Very cute but i wish the straps were a little longer. It's somewhat tight around the armpit area
4.0,Bought for my daughter to play dress up.  Nice dress she loves it.  Quality was good.  After a few wears one of the layers of material was separating from the seam/dress.  Which happens with typos kind of material.  I was able to mend it and reinforce it by hand.  The little belt was huge but we improvised.
4.0,"Bought for hubby who wears 11, they fit! but after washing they fit me (womens) size 10"
4.0,Add said order regular size but I should have upsized
4.0,Weight of a phone with thin case causes item to slide down.
4.0,"The fabric on the hat is good quality. The inside is made of a cardboard, so when it is delivered, if it wasn‚Äôt treated carefully it easily gets dented. Unfortunately mine did get dented. I had to break a whole in the hat and used a stick to pop up the dented side of the hat. So what you see in the pictures is after I popped the dent out, and I tied my on ribbon on it. Besides the dent, it's a pretty good product. Also, it is loose when you put it on. But I‚Äôm pretty sure we can figure out a way to keep it in place."
4.0,"it is wonderful, I liked the product looks beautiful the pendant is nice I hope the item description also matches on the diamond and the emerald"
4.0,We loved it see my son's grandma face tells me she loved it
4.0,"I have a couple of pair of Lindsay Phiilips flats, and I love being able to change the snaps to change the appearance of the shoes.  This is especially pretty.  My only concern about the Snaps is that they com off fairly easily -- and, if you're not aware of that, you're going to lose one.  I've started attaching a mini glue dot to the snap -- seems to hold it more securely."
4.0,"As expected, fit well, lightweight synthetic material."
4.0,The price was right for what I expected of It. I didn't get a Box for It so I had to buy a regular one. The box took the 5th star :)
4.0,"Super cute, me and my friends got 4 matching sets of these for a y2k birthday party, we were super cute. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 so def a little short. I plan to hem the pants and I wore 4inch heeled boots for the party. But my taller friends didn‚Äôt have the problem. The top I wear all the time for fun around the house or for cute days in class or making dinner with my boyfriend. The pockets are on the boobs but it‚Äôs still cute just not super functional unless it‚Äôs chapstick haha. Over all worth the price!"
4.0,I loved it. I‚Äôd buy more if needed.
4.0,"I got this product in hopes of getting black workout leggings to go to the gym, but instead they are way too stretchy and I don‚Äôt think they will last me long before they stretch out at the ankles and become loose fitting. Do not get these for workout purposes, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend yoga either, maybe just to wear casually or lounge wear. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable washing them because I feel like when they come out they‚Äôll be completely stretched out and not good anymore."
4.0,"Fits great, looks really good and the quality is nice. It just has a funky smell. Otherwise I feel like I will be able to use this and not worry about it breaking or stabbing me while I perform in it."
4.0,Likeüëå
4.0,It's a very nice pretty dress but...
4.0,"SUCH A CUTE DRESS!! I ordered the long sleeve royal blue in large. I almost ordered an extra large but after reading the reviews people said the dress was large as is so I did a large instead. So glad I did! The large was a perfect size and super cute. Not a super thick dress which is nice is the Virginia heat and humidity. Comfy and flows easily! I ordered it in red and teal too! I wish they had the black in large too, I‚Äôll order it when they do!<br />I wish they offered more colors as well like a beautiful fuchsia or violet. Please add more colors!!! I can definitely recommend this dress! I‚Äôve got curves and a little bit of a tummy due to hormonal issues and this dress hides everything"
4.0,"Good quality, not exactly OD green, lots on velcro for patches, and it fits well."
4.0,I bought these to keep my glasses off the floor - they work perfectly for that. They look nice and I can change colors with my moods.
4.0,"I wear size 8/8.5, the stretch is fine, the compression is good‚Äînot super cushioned though"
4.0,"I wear a size 10 womene's, which is usually considered a size 41 European.<br /><br />I ordered a 10, and when these showed up, they were size 42. So I was surprised and hadn't read the transation to say these are actually 42 rather than 41, so they ran a bit long for me.  So be careful when ordering because they may run long on you due to how they translate the sizes into American sizes.<br /><br />They are comfy though.  I have a wide foot and they feel just fine on width, and the arch support is nice though it's hitting me a bit odd since my foot is sliding forward due to the length.  Otherwise a nice shoe, though the sole itself is quite stiff.  If you want a more flexible slipper sole, this is not it."
4.0,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  My wife seems to be pleased with the quality of workmanship and materials.  But, she keeps asking me if I heard her correctly when she asked for a Birkin.  Yeah, right.  $100,000 for a purse.  This was a much better choice."
4.0,"The bracelet was a little twisted I'm the links, but tje whole set is nice."
4.0,"Package came missing 3 of the black stoppers, and a fourth that was missing a spring (making it useless). But all in all still good for the price."
4.0,They‚Äôre a little smaller than I was expecting. I wear typically a size 6-8. They were a little but more snug than what I was expecting. I was hoping to go for a more loose fit.
4.0,"If you want it to fit like the model in the picture, she is probably a small, wearing a large or extra large. I was disappointed in the fit. I am a medium (5'6"" 135 lbs) and ordered a medium because somewhere in the description it says roomy or something. Yeah not that roomy. And the fabric is a little stiff so the drape isn't that nice hang you get from a linen/cotton blend."
4.0,"Really cute, but the arm sleeve came apart while wearing under normal wear, it just came apart at the seam. Mabe could of made sleeves more roomier. Disappointed.  Coat was really super cute though. Shipping was fast."
4.0,"Pendant is fine.  loop is big enough for a chain and the pendant is as advertised.  However, the chain that comes with it is rather short.  It barely fits over my head.  If the chain were longer, I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,Bought for my father in law for Christmas last year. I was disappointed that this is NOT a harley shirt as advertised but that is my fault for not reading the small print. He did like it alright and he does were it.
4.0,Ordered a l\el due to calf size. Is a little long. Otherwise is comfortable.
4.0,"I like the kelly green tank top and the polyester fabric.  However, I'm disappointed that I have to iron the tank top every time I wash it."
4.0,"The hat I got is a 59 cm - this is a little snug for me, but fits well enough.  The hat looks pretty much like the picture.  If you are have some authentic German camo, this isn't an exact match, but it is pretty close.  And it appears to be well made - can't beat the price on this - I am a happy customer."
4.0,"I got this as a gift from my mother and I really love it. The chain is not as long as I prefer my necklaces to be, but it fits very nicely and is easy to clasp without looking. It looks great and feels nice, and it‚Äôs not too heavy. Very comfortable to wear. I even forget that I‚Äôm wearing sometimes."
4.0,"Pretty, very satisfied!"
4.0,These are good capri's but better for people with more junk in the trunk.
4.0,I like the outfit and gave it a 4stars because the ankle part is two wide and I have to have it fixed to fit around my ankle area properly. But it would be better if that part wasn't so overly wide. Kind of strange that it would be so big in that area.
4.0,I wish the screws were tightened a little more but other than that they absolutely beautiful and I would buy AGAIN. Oh and I love the soft bag that I can store them in
4.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C4NS1RO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12
4.0,"Look good material is nice, just a little tight om the thigh causing them to roll down a good bit."
4.0,"Super cute!! I will say, mine fits about perfect. This is a bit concerning because I ordered a Large but I am a size 6 and pretty average stature. I love it but I'm not sure the sizes make sense"
4.0,"Very fast shipping. Super cute shirt. A little snugger than I expected, but it‚Äôs still good. :) (Kiddo is a solid 2T at 2 1/2 years old (28 lbs at his 2 year dr. app), and I purchased a 3T.) Overall, very happy with this shirt. I may order another one in a larger size so my kiddo can wear it for longer, because of how cute it is."
4.0,"It‚Äôs nice, just something you‚Äôd wear to a quinceanera. It doesn‚Äôt scoop down as much as it shows in the picture. I like a little more of a V or it to scoop more at neck line."
4.0,"I usually wear a size 2 / 4; the medium is a little snug, but am keeping it because the hubby &#34;likes it&#34;. The fabric is lightweight and swingy."
4.0,"Finally put this together. Assembly was straight forward and easy enough. The vanity seems sturdy...not to sure about the stool, but my daughters loved it."
4.0,"This is a good ""generic"" spring time dress. While it's not my favorite pattern, and the fit is just ""ok"", I think once this is dressed up with the right shoes, accessories, hair and makeup, it'll all come together. But for sure, the pockets helped take this from ""meh"" to ""ok I can work with this""."
4.0,Product was NOT placed at my door but placed at the bottom of my porch.
4.0,Material is ribbed and on the thin side.  Fits as expected.  Nice to have as a second mask during these times.
4.0,Absolutely love this dress. It's very comfortable and and purchasing another from the company. The fabric is very soft and comfortable and I would absolutely recommend
4.0,Okay for masks...  not my favorite but they work
4.0,These mask were for my company‚Äôs masquerade party. I shared with some of the ladies that didn‚Äôt have masks to wear. They were really pretty but a little uncomfortable around the eyes. We ended up taking them off before the party was over.
4.0,"this is what I was looking for to wear over sleeveless dresses.  If you are unsure order i size larger than you normally would.  This is too small to wear alone, however works well over sleeveless dresses"
4.0,The comfort and style of this is very cute. It is a bit larger than I expected and the design is slightly see-through allowing to see the outline of your bra unless you wear something underneath.
4.0,"First thing I noticed about these leggings: Wow, so cozy!  Thick and soft, and when I pulled them up my legs I could already feel the warmth.  Then, I looked in the mirror and noticed the second thing: Holy Cow, Batman, that's some major camel toe!  These leggings have not been made in the pattern most popular for leggings: a large triangle piece sewn into the crotch area to keep the seams apart.  As a result, these leggings have one big seam going from butt to crotch, separating your nether regions into very squishy mountains on either side of a deep valley.  It's super ugly looking, gross, and not something ANYONE wants to see you wearing, trust me on that.  So - buy these.  But wear them inside your house, cozying on the couch, doing chores, etc.  Don't wear these in public, because even if you DGAF, everyone else will."
4.0,I was expecting it would look better. It looks cheap
4.0,I liked the style  of the dress
4.0,Great wallet. Gave as gift and he loved it!!
4.0,Did not realize it has a floral back panel.
4.0,Good skirt but the inner lining is a bit short.
4.0,a tad bigger than my eye glasses
4.0,Comfortable w nice side pockets. Drawstring works well
4.0,"This coat is super cute, super economical and impressively super warm. Bought an XL to have space for layers underneath that is great but not really needed with this super warm coat. In 20f temp three layers underneath had me sweating in this coat.  I have worn it in 0-20F so far in windy Chicago. I am about 5' 5&quot; tall and My only request would be to have a version of it that's about 5&quot; longer to reach my knees. Meanwhile wearing a thin thermal layer under my pants works great!<br />Also getting a lot of compliments and inquiries amongst my coworkers. Sharing the love!<br />Thanks Sportoli for this great coat and AMAZON for supplying it!"
4.0,I love that this tote has a middle zipper section to keep things separate. It is a great tote for the money. My only complaint is that it feels a little thin making it seem like its not going to last long. Also the handles could be a tad longer because they come out of the fake buckles all the time.
4.0,This does run a bit small. I normally wear a size 18 and I ordered an XXL and it fit perfect! Also if you have a long waist the cups will not fit you in the right spots. But it is a beautiful suit!
4.0,"I wish Amazon gave you the option of giving half stars because I would give these a 4 and a 1/2 instead of a 4. The only reason they don't get a 5 is because they're just a tad smaller than I like my shades and I don't think the shape is the most complimentary for my square jaw and more prominent sized nose. But they are true to the description and pictures. They're very cute. But if you're looking for oversized these will only work if you have a small face with smaller features. But the Giselle brand are my favorite and I have multiple pairs and they make great gifts. They certainly don't look like they cost 11$. They don't feel that way either. The Giselle brand knows how to mold the perfect nose bridge supporters. I never noticed a difference in nose supports until I wore a new pair of Giselle's for a week and then put on an old pair to match my outfit and they felt heavy and like they were pushing down on the sides of my nose. I turned them over and compared with giselle's and there was a visible difference in the design of the supports. I have since replaced all my old sunglasses with Giselle cat eye butterfly hybrid design sunglasses. This pair is now kept in my glove box in case I ever forget to bring my shades with me or the ones I'm wearing gets damaged, lost or broken. I used to have a beat up pair of Oakleys in my glove box I received as a gift one year. I'm very passionate about always wearing sunglasses when you're driving. Now that I have so many Giselle's to choose from I was able to toss those crooked oakleys and replace them with these in black so now I will always have access to cute and comfortable sunglasses."
4.0,Planning to use these earring for a Halloween costume - they look well made but were a little big.
4.0,"I ordered a 'Moyabo Women's Vintage Bowknot 3/4 Sleeve Bodycon Peplum Club Ruffle Pencil Work Party Dress' for review in a size large.  My wife is about 5'7' wears a size 8 normally and this dress fits nicely without being too tight. Order at least a size up for sure in this dress.  It is made with polyester/cotton/spandex mix so it has a weird stretchy feeling texture.  The stitching is done well, I did not find any weakness or holes in the seams.  It is very green and needs some accessories of another color to tone it down a bit.  Overall, this dress hits me as so-so, not really of great quality, but not the worst.  The material texture is the biggest downfall of this dress as it just is not soft.  Overall, not a dress my wife would purchase in the future."
4.0,"I love the 3 colors that I ordered,  very nice fit"
4.0,In the picture it looks like ball shape pearls but they are button shaped.  They are the right color.  Other than the shape they are beautiful pearls.
4.0,Boob part was little I wish it had been a bit more material so I could tape or wear strapless bra
4.0,The headband was not stitched up on one side.  Can I just get a new one? I need the wrap now for a trip and don‚Äôt want to send the whole thing back  It‚Äôs a customer service issue only.  Love the wrap!
4.0,Love the design but is long in the torso like many people already mentioned and the cups are too small for the size. I ordered a XL and I'm a D. It feels like the cup is for a B going into a small C.
4.0,Cute on my little man
4.0,"Great product, arrived quickly. Only this is they are jet black! I still like them a lot, but I thought they would be more grey/metal/alloy color. good product anyway, just not true to pictured color"
4.0,fIT AS EXPECTED
4.0,"I like this dress for everyday wear but it is on the shorter side. The color is rich & the fabric feels nice, but the length of it keeps it from being one of my favorites."
4.0,The material is not so good but works just fine
4.0,Very pretty. The earrings are much larger than they look in the picture. Still cite though!
4.0,Not as big as I‚Äôd hoped but the bottom compartment was really neat
4.0,the color looked different in person
4.0,"My wife liked it when I gave it to her, but she hasn't worn it. I think she is waiting to have one of the daughters to come home to help her put it on the first time."
4.0,"These came fast and they look great, I wish the skulls were a little more easy to see but I still love them!"
4.0,"ordered and XL and it fits perfectly, even a little loose. typically i wear a size 14ish"
4.0,"Fit my daughter well,  had many comments about it this past summer."
4.0,I really liked these earrings but unfortunately they were to heavy for my ear lobes. I regrettably had to return them. If they ever make similar earrings lighter in weight I would buy them. The marcasite detailing is quite nice. Reasonable price.They also come in another color.
4.0,Maybe runs a little big at waist. Not high end fabric but looks good on
4.0,"Short review! So it has like seven or so different light up modes which is pretty cool! It comes with six or so ION batteries, it's rather easy to remove the covers as well as inserting the batteries! It would be a nice little gift to gift someone! To turn it off, you will need to hold both buttons for about three or so seconds!"
4.0,"Very nice classical looking watch , keeps good time, received several compliments on it the rectangular shape and roman numerals makes it stand out from most other watches."
4.0,The hooks are not heavy duty and the trainer itself it's a little thin. But overall it does its job.
4.0,"The skirt it's self is very pretty, the problem is the sizing chart according to the chart I should have gotten a 2XL but lookin through reviews I figured I should go with my regular size (XL) and I was right. Go with your normal size and don't worry, it has elastic ;)"
4.0,I bought the sweater hoodie for my mother. She is almost 80 and doesn‚Äôt like anything and complain about much. But surprisingly she liked this sweater and I bought her 2 of them.
4.0,"For the price, this suit is great. I wanted something inexpensive to wear at the pool at my local gym that was a little more modest and I could do pool fitness classes/swim in. It is fashionable but tends to run small. I ordered a 16-18, and typically wear a 14. I would recommend buying this suit ."
4.0,"I normally wear 2X in American sizes, so was a bit skeptical about being able to fit into this 2X based on reviews.<br /><br />The dress is short, but I wore a body shaper underneath that had shorts so I knew I wouldn't expose too much :D<br /><br />The lace snags, especially on the side zipper... And since it didn't offer much room around the laced arm area, if you tried to pull on it with nails you could possibly rip it. It tore a little in one area when I pulled the sleeves up (a personal preference since I don't like the feeling of long sleeves). I was most concerned about the chest area, but it had just enough room to squeeze the D cups with an unpadded bra.<br /><br />I got a ton of compliments that night. Good stuff, great price.<br /><br />But don't expect it to last after the first wash!"
4.0,These earrings are very lightweight. They add a little something extra to my work uniform. I love that they are unique and festive.
4.0,Nice dress. It just did not look good in me.
4.0,the sleeves are large lots of gathered mesh material. I really like the style thou.
4.0,"A little smaller than expected, definitely will not run through the dryer. Otherwise pretty nice for the price.  Will see how they wear."
4.0,These are very pretty and comfortable but MUCH bigger then I expected.  I love hem anyway!
4.0,"Received on time ,this was purchased as a Christmas Gift for my grand daughter ,I know she will love it."
4.0,Much bigger than expected. They are still very pretty.
4.0,"I think the bracelet should been all silver, no grey coating, or at least should be solid silver color available but its just my taste, the quality is good"
4.0,"My daughter is 10, tall and skinny. A 10/11 fit her great after being washed. This fabric is hard to keep wrinkles out of. But it‚Äôs an adorable dress. Perfect for so many occasions."
4.0,"Fit fine, feel fine. Nice and soft/comfortable. The velcro lets you adjust it to the exact fit you prefer. I just set them to one place and they fit jst right with my sox on. The reason I gave it a 4 is that the end of the strap sticks out a bit. It would look better if it laid flat."
4.0,"Cute necklace. Feels a little ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, but for the price that‚Äôs expected."
4.0,These are not the same color as the picture but are so pretty. A bit lighter blue but still great. They fit and could have even gone down a size. These look great. They are well made.<br />I recommend these and do not size up.
4.0,"It's actually a really beautiful dress. However, I was expecting it to be shorter. I'm 5'9, ordered the midi mini dress, and it still goes down to almost my knees. I wanted to wear this on a vacation but this is more of a dress to wear to a wedding. Returning only because it's not what I was looking for."
4.0,They are pretty but heavier than I preferred.
4.0,The glasses are good and sturdy .  Great fit and look
4.0,Favorite too large in the butt. I was going to purchase these they were going to take away to receive. I did purchase some that were a lot of like. And there are large and they fit really well I like them a lot.
4.0,Larger than I anticipated but very nice.
4.0,Sized a bit smaller than advertised.
4.0,Great fit feels nice.  Size ran true
4.0,"I bought xsmall because of the relaxed fit. And they fit great, very comfortable n soft."
4.0,"these hands are great and feel awesome, but there was blue paint all over mine. it was mainly in the finger joints."
4.0,"Very comfy and warm slippers! I wear them all the time, they are durable and well made. I am a size 8 1/2-9, I ordered a size down (medium) when I ordered upon reading reviews and I'm glad I did, they are plenty big!"
4.0,"Nice, but a little snug."
4.0,"Before receiving these I was afraid they were going to be too big, because on the pictures they seemed a little to large for my head. But, that was not a problem they fit me perfect and I am able to wear my eyeglasses under the goggles which I like. The part that touches the face is made of soft plastic, and that makes it comfortable to wear. There are also 2 vents on the bottom and 2 on the top I believe these are to keep them from fogging up. Also, the tint is a light black color so it acts like ‚Äúsunglasses‚Äù to protect the eyes from the light and glare of the snow.  I have yet to try them out going skiing, I only went outside with them to see how they felt. But I will update this post once I get on the sloops!<br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price for exchange of an honest review."
4.0,There is no silicon for 14-10g bc they are too small- but the 8g silicon will not go in
4.0,She absolutely loved this but the back want stay on one so we lost it found it and lost again is there anyway we can order one earring
4.0,Good for the price. Just as expected. Thank you
4.0,"I originally bought a medium, but a caftan is supposed to be loose fitting.  I wear a 16, being a short, overweight 70 year old (and a lot of us are overweight to some extent, since we don't have to please anyone but ourselves).  This was too clingy for comfort in a medium.  The large is very comfortable, the fabric is soft, but the pockets are awkwardly placed and unnecessary.  Better to sew the seams shut or not put pockets in the first place."
4.0,"This hoodie is thin and soft, very comfortable.<br /><br />Unlike my kids‚Äô heavy sweatshirt hoodies, this is wearable on its own as a shirt for mildly cool weather. It is not something that will necessarily keep you warm for cold situations. You can certainly layer this with additional shirts, but it won't keep you warm in very cold weather on its own.<br /><br />Another issue is that it really doesn't provide the ""fitted"" or ""flared"" look that is shown in the marketing picture. The bottom of the garment is cut straight and does not have the fluted ends that are shown in the picture. Summary -- it looks dressier in the picture, so compare that to the picture I have uploaded to give you a more accurate representation of what was provided.<br /><br /> It does fit as expected. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 136 lb. and wearing a medium. I'm happy with it and will continue to wear it."
4.0,"I Love the style the most; it has a sexy, but yet elegant Look., now the sizes are sized much smaller so if you wear a Lg., I suggest going up 2 sizes to get the Look and fit you want. If you order your exact size I‚Äôm certain it won‚Äôt fit, but it definitely a Nice Dress."
4.0,"Una de las Cherries me llego da√±ada y pude repararla y se ven excelentes pero yo hice algo porque no llegaron bien, no se si fue en el env√≠o o ya estaban asi."
4.0,"Absolutely love these! I bought them in a size Large. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô6, 150 pounds for reference. They aren‚Äôt the greatest fabric of all time by any means but they also are inexpensive. The fabric however is bad and they aren‚Äôt see through! They are super comfortable & stretchy. The X part can be a little tricky when you first try them on but once you figure it out it‚Äôs a piece of cake. I would rate these a solid 8/10! Would re buy for sure! Hope this helps !"
4.0,Super soft and extra long if you're tall (nightgowns end up being mini dresses or shirts on me and I'm only 5'8.)  Lost a button after a few wears. Sized up one size to accommodate my 8 month pregnant belly (normally a medium size 6.)
4.0,This is a pretty dress. I comfortable. The only thing is that it is too long and I have to hold it while walking
4.0,Runs a little small I think.
4.0,Nicely done but feels stiff and in need of pressing at least.  But thank you!
4.0,"I use these in my tragus. They fit and are fairly easy to put in, but they don't really close all the way."
4.0,Yellow is too bright for me.
4.0,"This was a lot of fun to wear at Santacon! I did gussy it up a little bit by adding extra ornaments and a star at the top, which I would recommend you do, too. Stayed on very well with a few bobby pins."
4.0,runs small I wear a xl ordered 2XL  almost to small
4.0,Thin material; great for the summer
4.0,The hats arrived quickly and fit great.  The only downside was one of the legs on one of the hats started to come loose.  A little hot glue fixed that right up though.
4.0,I love it but it's a bit tight.The belt is very pretty and I had a lot of compliments.
4.0,As described. Shipped on time.
4.0,Good cuality product.
4.0,They are good for the price that you pay for them. They aren't anything special but they really do look good.
4.0,I really like it but it was way too short. It fit as a long top instead of a dress.
4.0,It is very pretty. Recvd several compliments while wearing
4.0,Very fun and great print.
4.0,"This boot is very nice for the money.  It fits well and I have problem feet.  It is a little hard to get on because it has elastic instead of a zipper, but I think it will loosen up with time."
4.0,"The necklace was delivered quickly.  The tree was a little bit bigger than expected, but the quality is really good.  My daughter loves wearing it!"
4.0,Not bad for the price I like it
4.0,I got several compliments. One from a 12 year old girl &#34;I like your shoes&#34; and one from an 81 yr old woman. &#34;Those are very sexy&#34;.<br /><br />If you want a pair of shoes that are attention grabbing...this will do it. I put a cushion pad inside for a little more comfort. Even without the pad they were reasonably comfortable.
4.0,"These are nice arm warmers for the price. Some stray threads needed trimming around the thumb holes, but over all they are comfy and I like them."
4.0,Happy with this top. Picture is accurate
4.0,"lots of feathers and glamorous, used for a halloween costume but the feathers still shed"
4.0,"Just what I expected from Lands End. Good fit, very nice quality. Highly recommended."
4.0,"This is such a beautiful watch - the deep red color is very eye grabbing. I only wish the silver part was a little better quality, but honestly for the price you really can't do better.  Easily my favorite accessory"
4.0,This lovely little pieces is a beautiful and looks good with any out fit from casual to night out. With my only complaint being is the Letter is deceptively small. The vendor photos don't do it any justice but overall a beautiful piece.
4.0,It came apart too easily. I only had it for maybe 3 months. I was embarrassed when it unstrung itself.
4.0,"These are not super high end looking but they make up for it in the ease with with you can change them. Yes, I have to pull out my readers but it takes less than a minute to change once you do it a couple of times. And that is a win In my book!! Perfect for every day wear as a busy mom."
4.0,"I had bought this necklace from a vendor at a random stall before, I was so happy when I found it again. This necklace is absolutely beautiful and definitely wards off negative energy that might come your way."
4.0,"I was loving these sandals for the gym locker room, shower, and sauna. They are super light, comfortable, and quick drying. But I brought them to the beach in Mexico and they broke on my third day there. I‚Äôm still giving it 4 / 5 stars because they don‚Äôt say they‚Äôre intended for the beach."
4.0,"This was really full and &#34;poofy.&#34;  Came right above the knees, which is good, but the waist was too small."
4.0,"Beautiful dress , best fit and I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Great product. I do wish I would have ordered an XL, only to get a little more length on the shirt. The fit around the waist is fantastic, as well as the shoulders, but it does feel a bit short. I ordered the large after having ordered the XL on the Neleus Tshirts, and I felt those were a bit too big. Maybe I'm just in-between. Would rather them be a bit short than feel like I'm swimming in it though."
4.0,Wanted something to protect my arms from the sun and yet not be hot to wear in the summer heat. This shirt serves the purpose well.
4.0,Very cute dress! Paired perfectly with a cardigan as well. Somewhat on the thin side though so you're can see your bra/underwear
4.0,Too large in the cups. I am a 34C. Other than that fit perfect on waist and felt like good quality. Thinking about ordering a size down. Wish it would have fit.
4.0,"I would have ordered a medium but instead got a small based and other's reviews of the sizing and it fit perfectly, I'm 5'4 and 142 pounds! brace yourself for  very wrinkly skirt and much ironing!"
4.0,My kids loved it. Will recommend. Fits on the wrist like a watch. Bands are silicone.
4.0,"The middle size was the only one I used.  The small earrings was too small and the large was too big.  A little like the three bears, but the Momma was the one that was just right.  The price was good, however, so it isn't a problem that I only used one pair."
4.0,"The dress was beautiful ! It looks like the picture but the gray color is a little bit lighter . Also, you might want to order a size up because I bought a small ( my usual size) and it does fit but it rides up a ton . A few steps and the dress has already ridden up to my hip . Great dress overall , though !"
4.0,"Nice hat, fairly large. Quality is decent. It ships folded in half which is slightly annoying but may be a feature of the design? I am not an expert in large hat design. It would not do well being thrown like Rayden from Mortal Kombat but is effective for keeping the sun off of your neck. You can see from the photo the lack of sun on my face and neck area and yet the sun is in the sky. It is like a head shade tree."
4.0,"Fits as expected. Seems to relieve pains. The only drawback is it turns my finger green, so I cannot wear it all the time."
4.0,"I'm a medium always.  This shirt is a little more fitted than I wanted it to be, a little clingy.  Very comfy though and soft."
4.0,Little more expensive than i like but good quality.
4.0,"I was using this in a haunted house and it did what it had to. It looked creepy, and equally sexy, (even though I wanted to be more creepy) it didn't fall apart, and came relatively fast. The only downfall is that it does look a bit cheap. But then again it is $4."
4.0,"These KOSY KOMFORT Cotton socks taught me a quick lesson.....I need more sock to pull up because a bad back prevents me from easily bending over to pull.  They wash great....fold easily and quickly.....just too little sock for me.  However, I loaned one pair to my daughter (who wears bowling shoes each Monday) and she loved them.....worked great in those shoes.  I told her the name and where to get some for herself and she was tickled to do so.<br /><br />I took off one star because they didn't work right for me but will for younger ladies like my daughter."
4.0,"Comfortable, easy to adjust but pink souls really fast."
4.0,"Everything I hoped it would be. Great material and feels like it'll last. I'm a size 16 and the length was still long enough to cover my butt without looking boxy. Only complaint, and it's not a big deal, is that the sleeves are a little tight so I can't roll it up enough to use the sleeve cinch. But I can still roll it halfway up my forearms. I'll be ordering another color for sure!"
4.0,Very cute. A little thinner then we'd expected. Also the crotch area is sewn a little awkwardly.
4.0,It fits as expected. Fabric feels bit thinner than expected.
4.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews, they run a little big. I normally wear an 8.5 and that is what I ordered, could have easily worn an 8.<br />They are comfortable and like other reviews pointed out unless your wearing them with skinny jeans or leggings to show off the buckles they just look like chunky boots, but they still look good<br />I really like them and they are comfortable, if I order these again I will order an 8."
4.0,"Nicely made, thick and sturdy but too big for my hands!"
4.0,a little tight on top
4.0,"This is a comfortable mask that fits my face well. However, after buying i realized it looks like I'm wearing a sanitary napkin on my face. I haven't worn this much due to the look. If I bought a color other than white this would not be an issue."
4.0,After buying several dresses in this style from different sellers this one is a keeper.  Fit is as expected and the material is nice.  Not too thin like some others i have ordered.  I will buy from this seller again.
4.0,"Really like this wallet although it will not hold cards in every pocket and stay snapped. I sorted through what I really didn't need to carry, thinned it out and now it stays snapped shut.<br />Not good for carrying change as well for the same reason. It does carry bills.<br />Don't see how it would hold an iPhone and stay snapped shut.<br />Inspite of my somewhat negative comments, it is really easier to deal with than a regular wallet. The cards are visible and easy to get to and put back in place. I do hope it softens up over time and with use.<br />The color is true to the picture.<br />It is not a small wallet."
4.0,Fit good my toddler 18 month
4.0,"Not quite large enough, especially for those with wider feet.  Good color & grippers on bottom"
4.0,It looks a little short but the pearl quality is fantastic. A beautiful stringed set for my mom.
4.0,Beautiful but the large fit like a small
4.0,Love it!! Beautiful.
4.0,I thought these were cotton tank tops but they‚Äôre more of a Lycra. I still like them.
4.0,Nice hat...husband loves it.
4.0,Really cute for a toddler Halloween costume. I wouldn't say the hat would hold up to constant use because the lens got a little loose from a toddler pulling on it but it still made for absolutely adorable photos.
4.0,"Very comfortable slippers--like walking on mushrooms! But,they do run a little large/wide but because they are so comfortable and warm, I'm keeping them."
4.0,"They are a bit snug but, overall I like the gloves"
4.0,"Too bad Amazon insists on a product review upon receipt.  So far these compression socks seems fine.  Comfortable, not too tight.  I measured 17 inches around calf.  XL said 16-18 inches.  Ordered these 2XL which said 18-20 inches.  Glad I did.  Anything smaller might have been too tight and too hard to get on.  But like I stated.  a review request upon receipt is not always going to get the real answer.  But since so many reviews are phoney, fake and solicited paid ones.  Take my review as a grain of sand."
4.0,Nice casual dress. Fits as expected.  Very comfortable.
4.0,I need to exchange it for a large
4.0,The quality isn't amazing but for the price I am not complaining. I got a size medium (which is my usual size) and it fit perfect.
4.0,Beautiful dress but I don‚Äôt like the button loops you have to wear something underneath or just make it a bikini coverup.
4.0,"The colors, the print are as shown in the picture.  I got exactly what I thought I was buying and the price combined with free shipping is a great deal."
4.0,"Very well made, just a little heavier than I thought it would be.  Washes wonderfully and is extremely comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Looked amazing on, the only thing is that the seam is starting to come apart after one use."
4.0,"I would have given this hoodie 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it pills quite a bit and was a size bigger than expected.  I always buy a size or two bigger, so this was a big surprise to have it almost 3 sizes too big  The pilling may or may not have had to do with the fact that I wore it before washing it, had to go out in the rain on laundry day lol.  But other than that it's a really nice medium/heavy weight hoodie that is super comfy and I will definitely buy again."
4.0,Order one size larger than your normal size.
4.0,Real SS. Much smaller than expected.  Clasp is a bit  tough on one.  Hard to clean.  Pretty nonetheless. Have had for a few months now.
4.0,Love this wallet. Pricey yet a very good fit for me.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter's Junior Prom. This dress is very cute and well made. It is elegant with the lace sleeves and a little quirky with the polka dot skirt. My only frustration is the sizing is way off. The sizing for a Medium states its a 2 but it fits not like a 6. Also, the bra area is really big for size too. We are returning this with the hopes that ordering a small."
4.0,"Wearing this strap right now, actually.  The strap fits my ASUS Zenwatch 2 perfectly and was easy to install.  The only negative is that the black is chipping off the bottom after resting on my desk as I type.  Other than that, the black is nice and shiny and looks good."
4.0,Not true to size. You will have to order a least 1 size up
4.0,Dress fit great! The top was super soft and the dress was well made
4.0,too small but super cute
4.0,"Liked it alot, just wish the material was a little thicker."
4.0,Cute dress lightweight for summer
4.0,"These visors are great. Easy to install, looks like the oem style but for 1/4th the price. The build is sturdy and looks like it should last. Time will tell but it seems like a quality piece right now. The plastic is thicker than the Wethertech and the wind noise is better as well. My only complaint is that the front piece is about a quarter inch too short for the window. Not ideal as it creates a gap but not worth replacing anything over it either."
4.0,"These made an inexpensive, but very nice finishing touch to my hand made focals."
4.0,"On the positive side, this is a very comfortable hat. I like the detachable strap - it‚Äôs there when I need it, can be removed when I don‚Äôt need it. The brim covers enough of your face to protect you from the sun. It‚Äôs great for traveling - you can fold it in your suitcase and it won‚Äôt crease.<br /><br />What I didn‚Äôt like is the general look of the hat - it‚Äôs rather sloppy looking as the material above the brim is folded and unfolded. It‚Äôs meant to look that way - gives it a very casual look but to me, looks sloppy.<br /><br />My navy hat was the same shade of blue as what‚Äôs shown here."
4.0,"These are string and don't stretch. They tie rather than have a clasp. Because of this each strand is super long and you cut it to the desired length. The colors of the beads are bright and vibrant and pretty. I've only tied one on and that was about 4 weeks ago and so far it's held up really nicely. It's very dainty, small beads, unobtrusive and very feminine. I do have some concern about the string as it will surely break down over time as these are not removable for showers and such, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm a long time wearer of waist beads and although these are not my personal favorites they are nice."
4.0,Awesome for the price.  It didn't resize very well and is either a little tight or really loose on my arm.  The wood is starting to show a little wear and it have not even been a month but with a cost that low not surprised.  Timer is the three dials on the face and hard to read but works.
4.0,Liked it.. just what I wanted but afraid the letters will eventually come off since they are stickers. Like it for now.
4.0,"These are great for my 8-8.5 sized feet, wide toes and narrow heels.  They look very clumpy in the picture, but less so irl.  They are very comfortable on me.  I love the height achieved with no heel angle!  These are not walking shoes.  You can walk in them, but these are not the sort of sandals that substitute for running sneakers when touring. They are perfect for the office or an evening out.  I'm very happy with them.  They are actually flattering on my feet.  When I saw the picture, I took a chance, and I'm pleased.  4 stars because they are not good for too much walking.  But, perhaps I should have given 5, because not all shoes are made for walking."
4.0,"I like that it was set up so I had to pull a piece to start battery usage, so battery life wasn‚Äôt wasted. Love the design. I wish it was a little bit larger with a larger display."
4.0,Good and versatile belts would recommend
4.0,"Love wearing this top. The pockets got holes and the material balls after a wash, but it‚Äôs still cute for the price."
4.0,"No complain, it is fair for this price anyway. One - two minutes slow every day. So every night, I adjust it one time."
4.0,"I went ahead and gave this shirt a 4/5 overall although it doesn't fit my body build very well in the sleeves.  Also, the collar is pre-pressed but doesn't lay identically on both sides.  This is light weight moisture wicking fabric so it will cling to your body... that could be a good or bad thing!  No Chaps logo visible on the shirt anywhere.  It runs true to size.  Label states made in Vietnam and no extra button included."
4.0,"I like wearing cotton, love pastels, my feet perspire and these are thin enough to wear with my snug Skechers."
4.0,Beautiful and flowy.
4.0,Bought these for myself. They fit perfect and great quality.
4.0,"I like the style and color. It is definitely thick material which is good cause it keep you warm. but it can be kind of stiff when you walk or sit. Nonetheless, i ended up buying more in other colors."
4.0,"My daughter is 7 years old and currently wears 3.5 size shoes. I purchased these in size 4, and they were too small for her. I wish there are bigger sizes available, but no- we had to return them unfortunately."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, though fits a little loose."
4.0,"I ordered a size large and it fit perfectly, but was a little tight across my chest."
4.0,"Handsome, elegant necklace, great price.  Looks great with  a V-neck .  Not too showy."
4.0,Nice tank. I thought itd be a little tighter like a compression but it's not but that's okay. Would definitely order again.
4.0,Pretty earrings.  Made nicely as well.  Perfect sparkle in certain light.  No one would know they are not real.
4.0,Too small unless you want something very compact.
4.0,Nice dress but fitting is not well
4.0,This dress fits comfortably.
4.0,"Was a bit smaller than expected, but she loved it."
4.0,"Great price for what was included! I use the larger bag to carry my books and the next size down to carry my personal effects. What makes it great is if I need something smaller for a night out, I can."
4.0,Hate when they just throw it on porch ...but states it was delivered an handed to a resident at address! An the material super thin! But my daughter likes it pants fit a tad bit too small  cant pull all way up on butt! So crack exposed when trying to sit an crotch area looks funny bc dont go up fully
4.0,"I purchased this purse to serve as a simple work bag. I thought the style looked simplistic and professional enough for most work occasions. Now that I have it, I think the purse suits that purpose just fine.<br /><br />I decided to buy the red wine color option. The color is truth to what is depicted in the photos. The synthetic leather is a bit too shiny for my taste, but this does not ruin the purse for me. The synthetic leather is soft to the touch, which is nice.<br /><br />Regarding size, this bag is perfect for my personal needs. I have a 2010, 13 inch MacBook Pro, which fits perfectly in the bag. I am able to fit, in addition to my MacBook, a padfolio, a couple moleskins, my checkbook wallet, and several pieces of make-up. This is just enough to get me through the workday. I reserve this purse for work. I have another purse I switch to in the evenings, so that I don‚Äôt have to dump out all my work stuff at the end of every day. It is convenient because this way I never forget anything on my way to work. Other reviewers have sent the purse is too small. Perhaps you can make your own decision as to if it is too big or too small based on what I have said I can fit inside.<br /><br />Do note that because leather is soft, the purse will slump over when you set it down and does not hold its shape. To combat this, you can keep a folder inside the purse and close the zipper. That way it will stand up straight when you set it down.<br /><br />On the inside of the red wine purse there is an off-white lining. The lining has purple flowers with dark brown stems. I believe the stitching is well done I will hold up for a long time with cautious use. The detailing, or zippers and buckles, feel sturdy.<br /><br />Regarding pocket storage there four major compartments. On the inside there is a large zippered pocket in which I fit my eyeliner, mascara, concealer wand, and pens and pencils. On the inside, opposite, there are two shallower pockets about 5 inches deep that do not close with a zipper. The last pocket is located on the outside of the purse. It closes with a zipper. It‚Äôs size is about 6 inches deep by 8 inches wide.<br /><br />Overall I really like this purse and I‚Äôm happy to wear it to work. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my fair and honest review."
4.0,It's a lot bigger than it looks in the pictures but other than that its fine
4.0,It was very nice worth every penny but  if the material had been a softer one would have put it over the top. But even with that being said I would purchase another one in a different color.
4.0,"I wish I could say that this fit me! Because it seems to be made out of great quality. However, it‚Äôs not meant for every face, because the foam and the rubber do not seal around the nose comfortably, unless you have a flatter forehead. The material is very quality, and I can tell that the visor is made out of good glass, or plastic. Well, that‚Äôs not for my particular face, I think most faces will find this useful. The only thing I would be aware of is that the bridge of the nose might not always fit this particular design."
4.0,"I am not one of those ""I can pack a weekend's worth of crap into my purse!"" kind of people. I just want it to hold what I need on the daily - wallet, phone, compact, sunglasses, some lip balm (ok maybe 3 lip balms), and hand lotion. I had been carrying a Lo and Sons bag that was just too big for me - I liked it, but it was at least 60% empty all the time. The only thing I do NOT like about this bag, and why I took off one star, is that the strap is not removable. I would greatly prefer being able to swap out the crossbody strap for a shoulder strap if the occasion warrants it, but I'd been looking for a good purple purse for a couple of years, so I finally gave in. I tuck this into my work backpack every day and the strap just gets annoying swimming around in there, but otherwise it's been great. Good quality and has held up well."
4.0,The fabric on the skirt is very stiff and can easily wrinkled so you have to make sure you iron it before wearing it.
4.0,Just like picture !
4.0,Love these leggings. I wasn't sure what size to get so i went with what i normally get which is a size small. im  5'5 133 pounds. The length is just a tad bit long but they still look/feel good. The material is soft and they have not shrunk or faded so far in the wash. I do wear them often and can wear them for a work out and not get too warm but also wear them around the house or out running errands. Im in the process of buying more if i could only decide on the colors. my only request is that they would make these in capri style for spring/summer.
4.0,"Nice dress I got a small, but I had to get it altered a bit which I was expecting to do  but other than that it was a great dress like that the material was thick"
4.0,"Super cute. Runs a little small, epsecially the top was tight."
4.0,"They are very comfortable, but not very breathable. Wish they had a cotton panel in the crotch."
4.0,true to size chart and fit almost as well as the oneill for half the price.
4.0,The wife has been wearing them with no gripes so they must be ok !  They were a low price and made good.
4.0,"This fit is true to size. I got a size Medium. I wear size 10. I love the snap to help the chest area closed. However, you might want to wear dark under garments because even with the built in slip you can see through. I‚Äôm an older woman and prefer proper under garments."
4.0,"In case you read the reviews, but not the description; this is ONE piece if body piercing, apparently... I thought I was buying me a pair of earrings. My bad."
4.0,I got this for my 7yo to wear under costumes for multiple changes in her ballet recital. I was looking for a one that  priced reasonably and this was it. The clear straps are great and just what I needed. Also the multiple ways they can be attached will work well for future performances.  It is a soft material. The cut on the bottom goes up higher then a normal leotard to not be seen under the costume.
4.0,I like ti.his suit but it it way too long for me. I am 5ft 7in and this thing is dragging on the floor when i walk. It fits well. I got the medium and the fit is great. I just have a problem with the length.
4.0,"Other than Asian sizing, it is a very comfortable.<br />It will not show one shoulder due to sizing.<br />Very cute with gladiators sandals...."
4.0,This was very cute and sexy on me. Unfortunately my booty popped a stitch and I had to sew it up. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because my bottom is 50 inches but cute nonetheless
4.0,"For it's price ($9.99), I'm very happy with this dress. It's VERY flowy, more than I expected, but it's comfortable. Not much of a shape to it. I have yet to try it with a belt so I can't speak to how it looks with one. The pockets are too low for comfortably walking around with my phone in my pocket (since it swings around my upper leg) but it's nice to have pockets to stash something quickly to free your hands.<br /><br />UPDATE: So far, the color has stood up to machine wash cold (and hang dry). And it looks pretty good with a stiff skinny belt."
4.0,"I ordered based on others saying it stretched well, and that they had large legs.  Uh, not workable for me.  I gave them to a more petite friend.. so she got lucky.  I am 5'9&#34; and sort of an &#34;Amazon woman&#34;, no pun intended.  I'm overweight, but not morbiedly obese or anything.  SO, I thought this would work.  No, large in the case is maybe someone who is a size 12.  just sayin'"
4.0,Ran just a little big I‚Äôm normally a large but I‚Äôm kinda in that in between stage of not quite a large and not quite a medium always better to be a little big than too small. I could‚Äôve definitely gotten away with a medium but it still fit I just had to tie the top a little tighter than normal it arrived early and it‚Äôs great material!
4.0,Exactly as pictured but sizes are waaaay off! I ordered an XL & couldn‚Äôt even fit one leg in. My medium sized friend could wear the leggings but it was tight! Suggest ordering at least 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear.
4.0,it is good but the quality of the t-shirt could be better.
4.0,"Sizes run small. Not that it won't feel ok, but too tight is bad when it doesn't breathe at all... I wish there were half-sizes. It does the job, but look very closely at the picture. It looks like that."
4.0,I wish it was made a little better but for the price it was ok
4.0,"PRO's: I gave 4 stars because jacket is as the pictured, looks very vibrate and pretty in person<br />CON: Jacket runs very big, ordered for my Pettit 9 yrs old size 9-10 ""KIDS"" . My adult female 150 pd cousin fit the jacket and took it lol.  My daughter is 9 and very Pettit Im guessing if I want it to fit her I would need to order a xxsmall or click 5yrd old"
4.0,"This is a pretty dress and the large fits well. It was a little tight in the arms when I first got it, but now it's fine. I've lost a few pounds. I'm currently 5'4&#34; and 168 pounds and I bought it in size large. It's too long for me though so I'll have to get it taken up. A little gaping at the bust but not bad. I just need it maybe an inch or so shorter. It could be fine with heels or platforms but I prefer flats. The skirt is full and luxurious, and it hangs well, a little shorter in front than in back."
4.0,Cooling gator mask with ear loops. This works great for when we are riding on our quads. Easy to apply and wear gives good protecting from the wind and dirt. Loops around the ears and fits snug on the face. The front bottom is long enough to tuck into your shirt. Seems to be of decent quality and sewn well. Good overall face protection for outdoor activities.
4.0,"Overall solid construction. It was, however, a bit light/thin compared to some other vests I have purchased."
4.0,"Had some difficulties getting this watch, as a ladies was sent in error. However the issue has been resolved and I am happy with this basic but attractive watch. The square face gives it a timeless look and the dial is paired down and easy to read. A great watch for the price. If you're looking for a big watch this may not be for you. Also the strap could be longer."
4.0,"Buena tela, c√≥modo pero corre un poco peque√±o"
4.0,These are wonderful to take to the grocery store or farmers market. I've also used them to store onions in...many uses. I would definitely buy more.
4.0,"Awesome socks. Very comfortable and fun. On me, they are over the knee."
4.0,"Thought it would be shinier, but overall happy! No fancy packaging"
4.0,"I really love the look and fit of this dress!  I deducted one star because the fabric (64% cotton, 32% nylon, 4% spandex) is a bit stiff (not flowing like cotton).  It also requires ironing after washing.  But other than that it's very comfortable and flattering, I will buy more from this company."
4.0,"Hat turned out to be too big for my head, so my husband is wearing it and loves it!  We ordered a smaller size for me and I love it too."
4.0,Cute for costume use but super plasticy looked a bit cheap woth the outfit had to return it
4.0,"Nice briefs, really soft. They run small so order a size larger.The waist is a little high, maybe it's just me.The only true drawback was the tag in the back. I can't believe that no one noticed how rough and irritating that tag is, I washed them twice thinking it would get better,( It didn't ). I ended up cutting the tag off."
4.0,"It looks as pretty as advertised. The only thing is the leather seemed thicker than I thought but really, that's to be expected for leather compared to the thinner plastic types. After wearing it for a few days, it was very comfortable!! We'll buy again."
4.0,Loved the dress wore it on vacation.  I am 5'4 it did touch the floor and little strings at the bottom made me get caught on to things which was annoying  but overall its beautiful and I would recommend  it.
4.0,"I ordered this watch because I needed a cheap replacement at the last minute for a wedding. It showed-up quickly and looks fantastic. I would highly recomend the watch to anyone looking for an expensive looking watch at fire-sale prices. I changed the band to a black with white stitching leather band, which I think compliments the look, but there is nothing wrong with the band that comes with it. I own 7 watches of varying degrees of value and I find myself grabbing this one as often as watches costing 70x more. I guess that is the ultimate compliment."
4.0,"Very nice! Mine came without extra lenses. It was concealed in original Glofx bag with a black carry sack, so it does not look as something was taken off. Maybe it should not be xtra lenses for color Black option."
4.0,i love this. very beautiful although the rose fell out after sometime. it's still one of my favorite navel rings.
4.0,The vinyl on the tree stuck together in transit in some places so when I opened the shirt it peeled. It is soft and my daughter still wears it but its not in perfect condition.
4.0,My wife loved it !
4.0,Really cute & comfortable to wear its just a little big. Have to use the very last whole.
4.0,"This Racol Cosplay Wig seems to be good quality for what it is.  The hair is long and thick enough to hang down your back. At first glance, it appears thicker than it is.  When wearing this wig as a fashion piece, you might want to  wear a hat since the scalp shows through on the top. Enjoy!"
4.0,These glasses are super comfortable.  I almost forgot they were on my face.  Light weight and functioned very well on my most recent fishing trip
4.0,Coloring is off
4.0,cute for gifts
4.0,Cute Dress!
4.0,I love these boots. Im wearing them under my wedding dress and have to resist from wedding them right NOW!
4.0,"Kinda frumpy looking and it is a bit big. Probably could have gone down a size but then I would be afraid the length wouldn't be long enough. Oh well, I'll keep it. It was cheap enough to keep and wear to drop the kids at school or whatever."
4.0,The fit was great. Definitely squat proof. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 / 200lbs and I bought a large but could prob have squeezed into a medium.<br />Bought the red color however this color is NOT sweat proof. I sweat a lot and it was a bit uncomfortable luckily my class was only 1 hour and everyone is too busy to pay attention.<br />Purchase dark colors instead
4.0,Definitely a great way of organizing my plugs and cables when traveling. Feels like good quality. But it is heavier than I thought. Being more organized comes with the downside of schlepping more weight.
4.0,"I got a size up in these pants because they are skinny shaped and when I put them on they do have a lot of stretch and keep everything in place. These pants can either be dressed up or dressed down, they have the style that they could look good in a business casual dressing situation or it can be worn more as leggings with casual shirt and shoes and look good. I like that it keeps everything in place and is secure and flattering on. The pants are the right length size on me and im 5'4""."
4.0,"Fits large, but that is what is expected. It's more of w silky material but looks cute and colors are bright..."
4.0,This was a great price for 3 pieces.  We wanted the large one for travel overseas to Figi.  It held up well through the airport.  I would definitely recommend this.  The only problem is that the lock that comes on the suitcase is not a TSA lock - we had to add our own TSA lock to secure the suitcase.
4.0,The color of the pug is pink more than tan show in the picture but it is still very cute!
4.0,This was a gift for my bf eho loves Vans hats. This isnt the first one I have bought for him but it's my favorite. Unfortunately the sides of the hat are not as long as the others making the hat feel like it could fly off. But overall its a great hat.
4.0,"Love the look and feel of this shirt. Bought it in champaign color. It runs a whole size small so typically in US sizing I'd wear a Small but with this I got the Medium and it fits like a Small. This color in particular is super beautiful but super sheer. I haven't quite figured out what to wear underneath yet but as I said it's super transparent and since its cropped too, that makes undergarments a little more challenging. But I still love everything else about it."
4.0,Love this watch band but had to give it a 4 because shortly after I started wearing it  the band would become lose on my arm without my doing anything to loosen it.  Love the colors!  It‚Äôs very pretty and the colors have stayed bright.
4.0,"Love the skirt! I had originally ordered a Large, but I ended up getting a Medium because I wanted to wear it higher on my waist. I  haven't washed it yet since I was just trying it out, so I don't quite know how that is going to go. From the material I think I will be handwashing it. The pockets are a great asset, and I personally will be ordering another one. I think it's perfect for the summer. There were some fly away strings in the stitching, but it did not bother me. I just cut off the excess strings and it didn't damage the product."
4.0,Bought as a gift. They were a big hit!
4.0,"Very comfortable and stylish!  They were too long, so i needed to hem them (I‚Äôm short)."
4.0,"It's okay...I'm not wild about the way the material feels on my skin, and I have cats and dogs - so yes, picks pet hair really easy.  But, it works for what I bought it for, to wear over tunics with leggings."
4.0,"Having bought lots of clothes online, China made, I was a bit nervous, but this shirt was pretty good quality. It fits true to size and the material is thin but similar to clothes you'd buy at Target. My only complaint is that the bottom white part is a little unflattering. The way it hangs is almost like a maternity shirt. I'll still wear it, I just might have to suck in all day. Haha!"
4.0,"I was expecting the case to hold 100 pens all in elastic bands. It only actually holds 24 that way. Though the main compartment is large enough to likely hold another 76 if they were normal sized pens. Unfortunately I bought it to hold sharpies. Yet, it is a nice enough case that I kept it. It is better than the box of sharpies I had before. If you are looking to hold 24 pens and a bunch of loose other supplies then this case would be perfect, just don't expect it to be a n organizer for all 100."
4.0,I think of a clog as sliding right in like my first pair.  This is not that.  It fits around the heel.  I cut the heel so I can now slide in.
4.0,"This dress was a little too long for me, as I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô0‚Äù, but the material is comfortable and it is so cute!"
4.0,It has a nice vibrant color and light weight feel. Sizing is not correct. I had to have it altered. I suggest buying a size larger.
4.0,"It's very cute, though cheaply made - out of the box, it had several loose threads and within the night that i wore it the paint on the eyes began to fade. I love the colors of it, though!"
4.0,"Very cute, and fit as expected!!!"
4.0,VERY NICE BUT IT IS VEEYHEAVY
4.0,Fit well. Washes nicely. Love
4.0,"Very cute! The only thing is it does produce white fuzzies, so don't wear it over black."
4.0,This fit as expected but was thinner than I prefer (which is what I expected due to other reviews).
4.0,good purchase but it did fit me a little big. They are really stretchy
4.0,I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 190. I got a large and it's a little small. Gonna reorder an extra large.
4.0,"Purchased for my husband, so far he likes them said they stay up on his legs all through a normal work day.. Seller shipping was just as estimated which is always a plus and they're worth the price paid."
4.0,"This bracelet is so pretty. I love this company and have several things from them. The bracelet is the most delicate pink color and looks so nice on, no matter what you‚Äôre wearing. You can dress it up or be casual. Either way, you will feel nice happy and pretty."
4.0,I like the color of it it never gets dirty
4.0,This &#34;color&#34; - the tie dye - is made of a thinner fabric than all the other colors of this same type sock.
4.0,"Really cute top, but it‚Äôs lined on the inside with the same patterned fabric as the outside. I got a light color and you can see the design through the outside layer. Not a dealbreaker for me but something to be aware of"
4.0,I'm a size 10 at the top and 12 at the bottom. I purchased a large and the elastic at the top was a bit big so I had it altered.  The fabric is thin but good quality because it does not fade easily and can be hand washed or washed on delicate cycle and hang to dry.  Pleased with the purchase.
4.0,"I have very large calves and have an extremely hard time finding tall boots that will fit, The laces in these make it possible and there is no gapping where the tongue is which is nice. The laces are just barely long enough for me that is why I gave them a 4 star instead of 5"
4.0,"Looks and fits great, feels even better. Love the material and good price!"
4.0,I ordered this with high hopes. To my surprise it was even more beautiful then expected! The fit was perfect .(True to size) The silver and gold was brilliantly polished. I worn it everyday since it arrived. Still has a great shine. It's a little larger then expected but it is undeniably a beautiful choice. Loads of compliments! Enjoyüëç
4.0,Reliable and easy to use. The only way to improve this watch is to give it an all-metal case (are you reading this Casio?). The resin case fails long before the electronics do (the spring rod holes wear out after a few years allowing the spring rods to fall out). I've gone through at least four watches over the years due to case failure and in each instance the watch's electronics were working fine.
4.0,"I bought this a few years ago and I still wear it today. It is really cute and I get compliments on it a lot. However, it is a little difficult to get on...trying to keep the feather balanced on the ring and getting the ball in the captive ring takes a few tries until you get it without dropping one or the other!"
4.0,"This is the second Lief Nelson sweater I've purchased. As with the first sweater, the material is warm, comfy and of very good quality. The collar and matching cuffs are quite stylish. The zipper is functional and gives it an additional element of visual interest. The black and white pattern is a bit busier in person than expected due to the large marling, however it is still a very nice casual look.  I will definitely buy Lief Nelson again."
4.0,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. A bit thin fabric and in wrong light almost see thru.
4.0,"I was looking for some summer weight sweaters for the office. This was priced so reasonably I couldn't go wrong. It fits well, and I really like the color."
4.0,Bright colors and nicely made.  Quality product.
4.0,"Light and cool....linen and cotton.  Can fold and keep in purse until needed.  Great for walks in the sun to protect face, neck,ears.  Looks great...maybe too large for someone with a tiny head and features."
4.0,These Jeans are very comfortable and a excellent fit
4.0,"Loved the dress but it was to small, I gave it to my daughter"
4.0,"I really like this romper and the way it looks. Besides running small the only drawback to it, which other reviewers have mentioned, is that it is cut very short in the legs. As in, your-butt-cheeks-could-fall-out short. If you either have a large enough chest to size up for that, perhaps it would help give you a romper that's just slightly longer. Otherwise I'd say this is for the ladies either with figures to tuck into these shorts or the aplomb to wear them anyway. Whatever floats your boat. It is a very sexy but demure outfit."
4.0,"Nice necklace.  A piece of wire was poking out , I had to cut it off before I gifted it."
4.0,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but a very nice color"
4.0,It feels sturdy. It is a little small.
4.0,"IT LOOKS VERY NICE, I LIKE IT VERY MUCH!!!"
4.0,"Washed and tried on only. Will be using for running so will update when that happens. So far, material feels thick and appears it will not slip. Fits at belly button or a little above."
4.0,The green is not a Heather green. The print is not as bright as pictured kinda faded looking.
4.0,Looks great! I thought it would be see through but it is not!
4.0,"I followed the reviews and ordered them two sizes smaller than what my daughter wears and they fit perfectly. They also have a nice memory foam insole which you don‚Äôt see often in toddler dress shoes so that is a plus. They came in a fancy little silver box with pink tissue paper which made it super fun for her to open. She had typical two year old ‚Äúflinstone feet‚Äù so the wide set on them is good. A lot of dress shoes I buy her seem to be made for dolls; long and skinny.  One of them did have a scratch on the toe, but it‚Äôs only visible if you look really close. Overall, she absolutely loves these shoes and they were a steal at eight bucks!"
4.0,"These slippers are good quality, BUT my husband normally wears a 9 and after one return, we found that size 12 fit just right!!"
4.0,"I ride everyday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so I have high and low end apparel. I would give them 5 stars, if not for the bibs‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like the feeling of any bibs.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù , 126 lbs., and the small is perfect. My opinion you can‚Äôt beat the quality for the price‚Ä¶.if you don‚Äôt mind advertising‚Ä¶..But, who<br />doesn‚Äôt like M& M‚Äôs ?"
4.0,Cute affordable watch I use it for nursing school the only thing is I take it off when Im  cleaning patient or watching my hands because water storees underneath it and it sticks to my skin so I take it off when i have any contact with water
4.0,"Pretty, but fits small"
4.0,A little small around the calf but i think thats kinda my fault bc of dance muscles but other than that it's perfect and works well
4.0,"As a fitness instructor I appreciate a good quality pant that doesn't show my goods in front of a class and holds everything in where it needs to be while I'm bouncing all over. Only problem is it gave me the worst front wedgie known to man. Super cute but camel toe like you wouldn't believe. Despite that, would still recommend!"
4.0,"Used for first time today. Comfortable, good style and appears well made. Hopefully will last for a long time."
4.0,I love the style and color and they fit really nicely however they seem fragile as though they are going to break very easily and the first time I put them on both buttons fell off.
4.0,"The sunglasses look good and pretty elegant, they are a bit narrow than expected so they have to be adjusted to cover eyes from sunlight."
4.0,"These are great! Very cute and comfortable. They are very see-through, which is fine for me, since I will always be wearing them with a modest sports bra. I use these for spinning, running, yoga, and weight training and have had no issues.<br /><br />I docked a star because they are not machine washable. This would be manageable for most clothing, but it's kind of gross for a workout tank."
4.0,I really like this top it's cute and I get plenty of compliments on it
4.0,"I love this suit. I followed other buyers suggestions and got a Size Large and it does run small. The bottoms are cheeky but not a full thong. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 140lbs for reference. I am a small A cup so I was surprised the Large top fit me. I do have a bigger butt (which is why I got a large), but pleased with the fit of the bottoms and cheeky high leg look. Took me a while to find a suit this style that I was actually happy with and fit me right."
4.0,These readers are darling! They would be perfect if they were bifocals so I didn‚Äôt have to remove them if I‚Äôm not reading. I still love them. They are sturdy and so cute!
4.0,"This is a really cute bracelet. I love sea creatures and love wearing this piece. It is light - weight which is nice, and well built. I recieved this product  in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,I like this shirt. It's soft and cute. I got a lot of compliments on it. My only complaint is that the sleeves shrunk after the first wash. I have longer arms so now they are a bit too short.
4.0,Love it...I wish you had more colors. I am a female and wanted a men‚Äôs medium.  So it would wear well over leggings. The company only had small and this color.
4.0,This dress is actually really cute although fits a bit large . I did send it back because I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the material . It‚Äôs more of a spandex bathing suit material but without the shine. It‚Äôs very cute and light if you‚Äôre looking for an every day spring or summer dress but it just didn‚Äôt wow me so I sent it back however for the price it‚Äôs really not bad
4.0,"Es id√©ntico a la imagen , pero est√° un poco traslucido"
4.0,Super cute and affordable but semi-sheer...needs a slip
4.0,"I loved the material and feel of it, but the backpack is too small for my purposes. I needed a bag that could carry my laptop and a pad of paper for class, and I was initially impressed that my 15&#34; x 11&#34; laptop just barely fit into the laptop sleeve. However, it was a tight fit on the top when I tried to close the zippers and it put too much strain on the straps, making my shoulder hurt. I would only recommend this backpack to people who have much smaller laptops, like a 13&#34;.<br /><br />If you want this backpack for the security -- the lock is not very good. It's plastic and is very easy to pick. I managed to lock myself out of the backpack and scramble the combination accidentally, and one of my friends cracked the combination in about two minutes by rotating and testing the dials one by one until they don't move when the unlock button is pressed.<br /><br />Update: After posting this review, the company contacted me and offered to provide me with a larger bag for free. Because of this I expect they will have larger bags available for purchase sometime in the future. I bumped my rating from 3 stars to 4, since their customer service was so great and they're clearly dedicated to keeping their customers happy."
4.0,Nice look but bad molding instructions
4.0,This is beautiful... I just might have to get it in another color!  This is my sexy spring/summer club dress!!
4.0,Very lightweight.  Goes really well with the peasant tops to bring in around the waist and hips.  I also purchase the silver.
4.0,like very much but a thought it would greener than it is....it's green turquoise.  Very pretty. lots of compliments
4.0,Great watch but the battery didnt last long at all.
4.0,"Great sound reduction.  Eat pieces pop off easily, but also reconnect easily."
4.0,nice tops
4.0,I wish I would have purchased a size smaller. Other than that it was perfect.
4.0,Some good ones.<br />Some okay prints.
4.0,small n compact
4.0,"These are pretty nice.  Would be better if the top covered a little bit less of the foot.  They definitely run small because I wear 6.5 shoe size and wouldn't want them any shorter in length.  As small as they are, I wonder how long they will last."
4.0,You can see through it.cool material.
4.0,I bought this with hopes of getting septum and nostril rings. They are there. This is more for entire body piercings. I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs not labeled in gauges. You just have to guess.
4.0,"I haven't had a chance to wear it yet, as the Texas Temperatures are not cold enough, but It fits and looks good."
4.0,"Perfect fit for my phone. Quality is pretty good; although, after about a month of continual use, the sitching in some areas, particularly the flap, are starting to come undone. The pockets are nicely sized for credit cards or hotel key cards. The case is durable and has protected my phone from a few falls."
4.0,Fits my 3 years old girl
4.0,Its a bit clingy on the arms but overall nice dress. Shows off all your curves.
4.0,"Contrary to what some reviewers implied, they are China made."
4.0,Fits a little smaller than expected but overall good buy
4.0,"This beaded bracelet with a butterfly is really cute.  It comes in a gift box so you can definitely give it as a gift.  It also has a little inspirational message on the card holding the bracelet.<br />It does appear to be well made, however, you need a wrist size less that 6 1/2 inches or you will have the gap shown in the picture.<br /><br />As long as you measure your wrist, I recommend this.  If you don't measure your wrist, purchase at your own risk."
4.0,This mask is pretty dam kool.
4.0,"I have had 2 Nixon tide watches over a couple of decades. They are fine, reliable watches. I particularly like the sine wave display of the tide stages. It makes me feel connected to the ocean,  even when far away from water. The images of the Base Tide watch show this display in the listing, even on the packaging I received. Doesn't happen. There is no sine wave display.<br />Setting the tide function is based on input of a single date/time of high or low tide. All remaining tides are calculated via a universal algorithm (or is it just a nice design). In my area some tide  times were over an hour off. My previous watches allowed selection of the nearest beach  and the watch based tides on that beach. I found them to be pretty accurate.<br />The 2 tone face of the Base Tide is new and interesting, Unfortunately, this option is not available for the Base Tide Pro version, which has the features i'm used to in my previous watches.<br />I exchanged the Base Tide for a Base Tide Pro for additional $23. No brainer. I will miss the 2 tone face, however.<br />I must say the seller, BC surf/sports gave me EXCELLENT customer service. My exchange was completed immediately and without hassle. Highly recommended and much appreciated."
4.0,like the sweater but will have to have a new zipper put in.
4.0,I ordered two sizes up and it was still a little small so I gave it away. The material is not the fabric that I thought it was by the picture--its like jogging suit material and not suit material.
4.0,This dress is very pretty and is a nice style - can be dressed up for work or an evening out or worn more casually. It is a beautiful blue - not as dark as it looks in the photo - more like a royal blue than a navy blue. The fabric is soft and stretchy. But it runs very small! I would recommend getting a size or two bigger than you normally wear.
4.0,"I liked the shirt. I didn't love the shirt.  I think that disparity was due to sizing.  The chart and the predictive modeling where amazon said, ""based on previous purchases, you would be a............"".  So I ordered as such. But it was too large.  Not horribly so, but a L would have been better than an XL.<br /><br />That said, during an outdoor run at 19F, with a t-shirt over it (and no coat), I maintained a decent temperature. It kept me warm-ish. I think a tighter fit would have made it better - but I have nothing really with which to back that up.<br /><br />I'd do this again, but I would knock it down one size."
4.0,"I love this shirt! A little on the small side, and not near as long as the picture, but I love it."
4.0,They were very nice but I bought the wrong size so I returned them.
4.0,"At first I wasn't too impressed with how they looked, but I decided to wear them  and they were SO COMFORTABLE and surprisingly got some compliments.  Anyone using clip earrings knows how important the comfort factor is.  These are comfortable."
4.0,alittke heavier than what I prefer but very very pretty
4.0,nice looking for the price
4.0,It was very Pretty but I had to reorder because the Pearl was too big to fit into the heart carriage :(
4.0,Sleeves could be a little looser but overall like it.
4.0,I love the assortment of the different vintage designs. I usually wear about 3 or 4 at a time and the variety of the designs really work for an eclectic bohemian type look.
4.0,"Boots were way too big, but still usable with a couple of socks on.  My little girl loves to splash in the puddles with them, no leakage."
4.0,"The silver on the heart and chain has almost completely worn off in about 9 months of wear. It's a full copper color underneath. My girlfriend still loves it though, and for the price I think it was worth it!"
4.0,"These watches were purchased for my ten and seven-year-old granddaughters.  They're very fun, the lighting feature is super cool, and the time on the dial is easy to read.  Both girls love these watches.  The only minor problem is they are easily broken.  These are the second sets I have bought.  I would recommend these watches to other family members and friends."
4.0,"They are cute and pretty, just the wrong colors that I needed."
4.0,Nice product as reviewed.
4.0,Not for stretching ears which either way no one should be trying to do with weights. Look awesome and just dangle.
4.0,"It's a good tank top, but it's not your ordinary tank top. This one is a tight fitting style. If you like it loose, order 2 to 3 sizes over your size."
4.0,Cute too small
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute top but the length is a little shorter than expected
4.0,These are very pretty braclets. they should come in a pretty box to give as gifts...
4.0,Exactly as expected. The only reason why this got less stars is because for pink blush color you pay literally double the price as any other color.
4.0,"This dress is lovely but I should have ordered one size up as my regular size was a bit tight.  Otherwise, I intend to order a couple more colors."
4.0,It is attractive and sparkly
4.0,"Excellent for Sun coverage. Not tight enough for compression. Material silky & soft, very comfortable & pretty."
4.0,The dress is cute but does run small so size up 1 or 2 sizes
4.0,"A little tight, but nice"
4.0,"Nice, thin, exactly as expected.  Except the size is smaller than expected."
4.0,"Excellent product, exactly what was needed, thanks."
4.0,I want a matching Necklace can't find one
4.0,"Its good, the lines on the shirt sometimes makes the shirt look wrinkled."
4.0,"The wait for this item was 4-ev-ER... And it was worth every minute of it! I'm talking high grade material, flexible yet durable, breathable while snug, and O-so-SEXY! I've received one compliment on mine so far! Wow.<br /><br />The zipper is a little high. I'd recommend just using the nearest leg hole to make pee pees... Other than that.. JaneDream Men's Short Sleeve Leasure Jumpsuits are number 1!"
4.0,the grey was too pink; but pretty.
4.0,"elegant piece, a bit big and heavy for the chain that is with it....but that can be changed for a better sized chain to support the pendent."
4.0,I am very pleased with these shoes!
4.0,"The wife likes the purse.  $94 for a simple pvc handbag seems a little odd to me, but who am I to argue....<br />It is not a leather purse, hence my apprehension on the cost.  Kate Spade is a recognizeable brand though and I believe it to at least be well made.<br />I think the style and size make it a very good item for daily use....<br />As others have stated, it does not come in an official box....so consider that if it is a gift."
4.0,"The description reads ""chunky knit"" but it's neither thick or chunky. Other than that it's ok, only because it's a gift and it's too late to return it."
4.0,"got it for my grandson, he is a skateboarder, he say the  hat doesn`t stay on when he  is skating however he likes the hat very much! his  second  complaint is the  volume  can not  be adjusted in the hat"
4.0,"It tells a story , I bought it because my heart is bottled up and that's my way of saying so. But it could also mean that your taken , ., It can mean ALOT of things but mainly, it's just cute and affordable and gives off a magical essence.... Despite it being costume jewelry"
4.0,"Not as absorbent as I would like, but they get the job done."
4.0,"Cute, but the gage is definitely larger than for simple piercings and it's altogether too large to ring through multiple piercings in close proximity."
4.0,Love the feel and print sleeves are snug
4.0,I went to Disney World and on a cruise over the summer and I loved this cap.  I didn't want to take it off.  IT was great for those hot summer days and also allowed me to stay cool.  I never felt the cap made me hot or bothered me.  It allowed my head to to stay cool while shielding me from the sun.
4.0,"The shoes covers fit my size 9 AirMax (Larger than usual shoes). Easy on n off. It helps you not to slip on the ice, but it does affect the comfort/feeling when you walk (makes my feet get tired easily). Imagine walking on jello all day long... But it is how it is when you get a full cover for your shoes.<br />The only bad thing is, after a few days of walking, including on the snow, my shoes started get wet a little bit and I see some little cracks here and there. It is still ok to leave it on, so your feet don't get cold in the snow. Get what I pay."
4.0,"Pants are great, but I think it‚Äôs needs a button with a hole, and not a snap. The snap where‚Äôs out before the pants do, lol.<br />Other then that, they have held up great. I got longer ones cause I‚Äôm not a fan of pant legs above my ankles."
4.0,Fit okay and was very comfortable but there was just way too much fabric and not super flattering on my body. I returned it.
4.0,"Best chain I've bought, it really stands out"
4.0,larger than I expected...
4.0,".. And it's colorfast! (I have it in black)<br />Straps do not adjust.<br />Nice over a t shirt and leggings. Not as long as another similar dress, I'm 5'4 and I'm not tripping over it"
4.0,"I am in the middle size of 34, they suggested going yup,  which I did,  however still a little tight."
4.0,"Good shoe, well made, looks good and daughter likes it.  Looks like it will last for a while."
4.0,"This bag is super cute but a bit big for my use. The straps are also a bit cheap and look like the type that will crack and peel.<br />The actual body of the bag is very beautiful and fancy. I love the princess crown detail and the colors are pretty. I bought this for my daughters ballet bag but it is too big for that, even if I take a change of clothes there is tons of room to spare. This would make a good day or weekender bag for a young child"
4.0,"good,I love it. I didn't expect the chain is so heavy! Leather is soft, and package is so tight that I spent minutes to open."
4.0,Fit my 3 yr old perfectly and worked great but cracked after one drop. We were able to put it back together and we will be able to use it again.
4.0,"My wife says her legs feel much better after wearing these compression hose. They took a little getting used to the first time wearing them, but she quickly appreciated how they made her legs feel. Eased leg pain. We'll give them more time before her final assessment."
4.0,Too small hole size for 6year kid head.<br />I cut the hole and sewed it up again.<br />Then it became great.
4.0,"These are a gift, but they are very cute......much nicer than I expected."
4.0,Sturdy little bag.
4.0,"I bought this a long while ago, and my neck was actually too small for them.<br />I believe my neck size is about 12 1/3 to 13 in., and this one extends beyond that, which is why my rating is 4 stars.<br />Still good quality and good service. Not extremely high quality material, so don't tug on them too much when removing them from your neck, though."
4.0,Muted coloring for warmer season colored clothing.
4.0,"Nice shoe, but if uyou have wide big legs your foot will.cramp ip in thiz boot"
4.0,"It's nice except that the sleeves are a bit too long and wide. The material is very soft, the color is just like it is in the picture, and it's really comfy."
4.0,My six year old daughter really liked the look of this sweatshirt. It appears to be high quality materials. My only problem is with the care instructions. Totally ridiculous to think this isn't going in the drier or washed with the rest of her regular clothes.
4.0,They are comfortable and I received compliments on them.
4.0,They are a good size and in perfect condition. Also a sweet deal for the quality
4.0,vibrant color!
4.0,Love it..becuz i am pregnant my foot was aching but apart from that they fit like a dreamüíú
4.0,The quality met my expectations. The zipper works very well. I didn't like the open mesh at the top of the bag because when I'm not traveling I intended to use the bag to store my suit. To prevent any dust from settling on my coat I'm hanging a light-weight jacket over the bag.
4.0,"It smells like leather for the first couple weeks. What I mean is, if you have it in your car with you then you will be able to smell it no matter where it's at. Did you leave your phone on it for a few minutes? Now your phone smells like leather. Once that smell dissipates this is actually a great product. It's probably my favorite wallet I have owned."
4.0,"I have the smartloft 60 hoodie and it may be my favorite jacket  ever. So i got this as a warmer version but its not the same. It IS warm and quality as expected from smartwool, but the fit is not as nice as the 60. I wish it was more athletic, slimmer in the waist. But if that's not your body type then totally go for it."
4.0,"Very pretty sleeves and is surprisingly long, however the material is a little sheer. Still a really cute top!"
4.0,"Too small and you can see thru it.  However, I gave it to my daughter and she wears it with a tank to under.  She is happy with it.  The colors are very pretty."
4.0,Comfortable sock with just enough stretch.
4.0,"I love everything about the dress, I just ordered bigger size."
4.0,"Like I bought 3 x 3 but should have bought 4 x 4 Oh well, we do with what we have.."
4.0,"Very cute, but the white area is a little see through"
4.0,"5'8, 163 lbs, 32 waist<br /><br />Good fit, as expected. Not my favorite material, but not uncomfortable either. Drawstrings tighten properly.  Pulls in the crotch a little weird."
4.0,"Great watch !  Good  price , subtle red accent makes it stand out ."
4.0,It's very substantial even if it doesn't look like it and it's yet is  lightweight. I like it a lot
4.0,"You design is great. The quality of material is very cheap and thin. I was expecting a thick regular hoodie but it is more like a long sleeve with a good. My daughter likes it. I got the size she normally wears in hoodies and it fits perfect but was hoping it would of been a little looser. All In all, I give it 4 out of 5."
4.0,"Love the red white and blue pattern.  The dress is a little long for me, comes below the knee and a bit see thru.  I almost always wear a medium probably could wear a small in this dress."
4.0,"Good glasses, a little big. Better for a halloween costume than anything else (probably steve jobs)"
4.0,"I wanted something attractive to wear when I have to wear a mask in stores.  This product is really attractive and works effectively except for the size of the ""mask"" portion of the scarf.  But since the ""mask"" portion is attached to the rest of the scarf, I just pull the scarf up a bit so that mask covers my nose."
4.0,a little tight in the arms
4.0,"Very cute dress, however the fabric rides up continually because it is extremely slick material.  You'd better not have an extra pound on you.. or it will show. I will wear this with a bolero or blazer b/c it does hug your figure-"
4.0,"my hands got all black from a powder that they come with, i just washed it off. a little hard to open but doable, they look nice considering pricing and fit perfectly all the lenght of both my pandora bracelets. i'm two days later, very sattisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Order 1 size larger
4.0,So hard to work the tiny flap thru the ear and then try and secure the two pieces together.
4.0,"Not the same fullness as their $200 counterpart at David's Bridal, but looked great under my dress!"
4.0,"I love the shoes, but I am not used to walking in heels this high.  But they were okay for an hour or so then I sat down.  They will be good for special occasions but not to walk around in."
4.0,love the cushion.  hate the material.  as long as I am wearing socks it doesn't bother me but without socks the plastic like material bothers me.
4.0,This was pretty comfortable and served it's purpose (to keep me warm). Nothing special about it but I will definitely wear it again this winter.
4.0,"Bought or a hospital bag, worked out for the most part. Wish it was just a little bit bigger."
4.0,"Been wearing this regularly for a few moths now. It‚Äôs a nice design but the gold finish wore off fairly quickly. It still looks pretty nice though, even in copper. But I bought gold, not copper..."
4.0,I purchased this as a gift for my nanny.  Her husband passed away and I thought it would be ideal as a guardian angel gift.  It is about the size of a nickel and is very pretty.
4.0,This is really a cuter day flattering suit. The bottoms are full coverage and the waist falls just below the belly button.<br />The only issue I have is that the cups for the top are really rigid. I've never had a suit like this before. I guess the top holds its shape no matter what you are doing and it's not uncomfortable so it's a minor issue for me.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, not cheap looking at all.  I read so many reviews before ordering this dress.  I'm 5'6&#34; 130lbs with a A bust.  In most dresses I wear a size 6, so I followed everyone's advice and ordered up 1 size to a size 8.  The dress arrived super quick, but it was huge.  I had 2-3 inches of space in the back that would need to be taken in.  Also, the built-in cups are nice, but for a A cup, they are just way too big, it make the dress look awkward.  I've ended up returning the dress.  I did not order a different size just because I think no matter what I order, the cup size won't look right."
4.0,"Inexpensive, cute and worth the money."
4.0,"Overall a great shoe, but seems a little large."
4.0,Good quality ! Durable and attractive .
4.0,"This tunic is perfect when you want a dressier look, but don't feel like expending much energy getting dressed. The fabric is thin, lightweight and stretchy. There's a detailed appliqu√© at the neckline. The tunic is on the longer side. I found the fit to be true to size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large. The medium would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Cute but extremely long shipping time.
4.0,"Love the style, look and color of the dress, but not the fabric."
4.0,"My son loves it<br />Normal quality t short<br /> reasonable quality, a little on the thicker side rather than cheap material<br />Size as expected<br />Wears well for a boys shirt.."
4.0,"love this  when I saw, it but when I got it ,it was to thin the cloth wasn't like the one on the photo."
4.0,"My 7 year old son loves this gauntlet.  I have to agree with other reviewers, it does have quite the odor to it.  It is a silicone glove and the jewels on it come off very easy.  We have had this for a month and have already had to super glue 3 of the stones back on."
4.0,Very flat lens face. I thought it was more curved.
4.0,"This hat is exactly want you want in a lightweight, large brim hat.  However, if you have a large head, like me, it's very snug."
4.0,"Wanted a shirt for 4th of July & went with this one. It's simple but cute, runs on the larger side for a loose fit, normally I'm a Large but ordered a Med and it fit good!"
4.0,"I received this product as a gift from a friend and did not buy this myself on Amazon, but thought I would review it. Overall I like this brand having bought other sunglasses myself and so my friend got this for me<br /><br />PROS<br />-Nice round shape, there is an overall style to these glasses<br />-Construction is sold when handled with care and there are no flimsy parts or loose screw<br />-Comes with a nice pouch that can be used to clean the lens in addition to offering some protection<br />-They stay on my face well even when I look down and while running - I try this with all sunglasses<br />-The lens color and frame color go well together, very cool looking and great for blocking out sunlight<br /><br />CONS<br />-My face is more angular so I don't think it fits it the best, more suitable for a rounder face and so keep that in mind<br /><br />Disclaimer: This was bought in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Nice hat.  Sweat drips off the front of the bill instead of in my face.  Light weight.  Good material.  I like it.
4.0,"Ordered up a size based on the review about the fit on top being smaller, but it runs very large. Clothing items from Amazon always run small but not this item. I am a size 16-18, ordered the 2XL. I should have gone down a size. I bought it for a coverup to throw on at the beach so it works fine for that purpose.  I carry most of my weight in the tummy area and busy (42D). The elastic gathered waist does add a little volume in the front so I wouldn‚Äôt say it is slimming, but it is very comfortable and the length is perfect - skims the knees. For the price I think it‚Äôs a good value. If I was planning to wear it as an everyday dress I would have returned and sized down.  Color and pattern looks exactly like the photo. It is very soft. Overall I am happy with the item."
4.0,A bit see through. But well made.
4.0,"Overall good jacket. It‚Äôs not as soft as I was expecting and I don‚Äôt really like the neckline but it‚Äôs comfy and nicely lined and seems like it would keep me warm so I‚Äôm going to keep it. Also I bought the brown color and it‚Äôs not quite the color as shown, it‚Äôs slightly warmer, more orange brown"
4.0,"The ring looks really nice, but yes, you can tell it's not a real diamond. But it when you don't want to risk loosing your real one, it is pretty. Size fits perfectly good. I got a 7 and just right."
4.0,"Really super friggin'm comfy socks. This is the 3rd variation of Spikerings that I've ordered. The other ones tend to wear out in the toes somewhat quickly, but these appear to be more flexible fabric. Only complaint is that the color of the ankle band that shoes above low shoes are random colors."
4.0,A little tight around the waist but I‚Äôm a little fat.
4.0,Dad loves them for the winter rounds of golf
4.0,Nice pattern snd durable material.<br />Plus size is a great fit. I‚Äôd buy it again.
4.0,I like it a lot. Thank you
4.0,True to size. Nice fit - Loved it so much I got the pink
4.0,Very comfortable. Love the colors. Looks great on its own or with accessories.
4.0,Great colors but some glasses arrived broken. Other than that a great product for treat bags
4.0,Nicely made and wears well with many outfits.
4.0,Nice but expected better quality of the golden color!
4.0,"Good re-placement parts, fraction of the OEM price.."
4.0,I like this pack for summer day pack and summit pack for peak in summer. I also use it for trail running. Love the phone pocket at the front left.
4.0,Great for a work watch that doesn't light up until you need it to. Great price for a good watch.
4.0,"I love this. Just absolutely love it. The smell isnt over powering, and its a sturdy, cute, necklace. I would recommend it."
4.0,"I went with the measurements and I ordered two small dresses. One dress didn‚Äôt fit in the hip area, I could have forced it down but would not been comfortable. The other dress was a perfect fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 115 lbs, about 37 in the hips.<br />The fabric is not very sheer which is good. I also have small breast and think it looked good on that area. Not big fan of the print."
4.0,great hat it fits very well but if only they had a next size up from its biggest size it would have been awesome.
4.0,"I purchased these in the 4mm size, which is a bit too small, but the colors are really pretty, very saturated and the quality is excellent. I am so thrilled that I can wear stainless steel earrings because I have an allergy to nickel and sterling earrings irritate my ears. These do not."
4.0,"SO for some reason, i didn‚Äôt really expect the hat to be a dark black. the lighting of the photos made it appear to be similar to a very dark navy (in my opinion) and i wasn‚Äôt sure whether or not it was a baseball cap or a flat bill for sure, even though in the pictures it did seem more flat. but it ended up being an entire flat bill, which i was hoping for it to be a more baseball cap shape, but i ended up just bending it to shape it. The hat is literally the same exact one from Zumiez(has the tag), which was one of the ones i looked at before coming to the final decision to buy this one, but that<br />one is close to $40-$50 i believe. So I wasn‚Äôt mad about it or anything, just thought it was funny. The hat is a good quality hat, just wish it was a baseball cap so I didn‚Äôt have to bend it. If you want a baseball cap type hat, i would look somewhere else, I only ended up buying this one because it was relatively cheap."
4.0,I got these for my daughter and she loves them
4.0,Good sports band. Does well in protecting the tracker. Would Prefer if there were different sizes for thicker wrists as I prefer my bands a little longer.
4.0,"The material is too thin so you will probably need a slip under it, but it is otherwise a very striking dress!"
4.0,"These earrings are nicely made, but too small for my arthritic hands.  I will be returning them."
4.0,"They‚Äôre don‚Äôt seem as sturdy as some other ones I have purchased before at a similar price. However at less than $2 each I can‚Äôt complain about the build quality. With how fast I lose/break a pair of sunglasses at work I don‚Äôt think longevity will be an issue. Something to note as well is these have a gloss frame, I would have preferred a matte frame but that‚Äôs just me being nit-picky as I didn‚Äôt notice that mentioned anywhere on the listing(I might just be blind though)"
4.0,"Timely delivery, great product."
4.0,I loved the shorts but just too small.
4.0,"Nice quality. Smaller than I hoped, but my fault for not really paying attention to sizes."
4.0,"Super comfy, great material, at least 8-10 inches too long for my 6‚Äô tall husband ‚Äî but aside from having to 80s cuff the ankles, they are great!"
4.0,The Tutu looks good but way to small for 7-8 y o. Try to get 2 size bigger.
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this dress, but its not very comfortable. The zipper goes all the way down your butt instead of stopping at your lower back - so you constantly have this zipper riding up! And there's no liner layer - so I have to wear a slip under it to feel comfortable. The zipper is annoying every time you have to sit. I have NO IDEA why they felt the need to make it go down so low."
4.0,"pretty, but large. I usually order a small and this was too large, unfortunately I didn't think about returning and now it's too late, so I'll be looking for someone to give it too."
4.0,Other than these running a bit small they are very nice gloves. My husband usually wears a med/lge glove and these fit him in an xlge. They have a nice grip and provided a comfortable handhold for riding.
4.0,They run big but I‚Äôd rather too big than too small.
4.0,"love this scarf, the colors are brilliant, a bit longer would be nice."
4.0,gave to my 30 year old daughter for christmas . she really liked it and with the snaps she has two choices of length. she has small wrists like me.
4.0,"Cute, fits as expected"
4.0,"size runs big, have to order a medium.  But really like them"
4.0,Like the other review stated there is only a small hole to put your head but there is absolutely no give and it is a battle to put on and to take off. It is worth the price but be prepared!!!!
4.0,"Fits my 6 year and will be perfect for her rock-star Halloween costume. It's made well (in comparison to other ones I've bought), especially for the price. The only negative I have is the skirt has quite the odor to it. I'm sure after airing out and hand-washing it will be fine, but you'll want to wash it prior to wearing for sure!"
4.0,They are ok. I expected them to be cuter. They will be the boots I wear when I just want something different. They just look a little generic. From the comments I expected super great...but got meh....
4.0,A little bigger than I thought but very cute!!
4.0,Good everyday light snow boot.
4.0,"I bought this blue dress as a maternity dress to show off my bump.  I wore it during 20-32 weeks pregnant.  It fit snug of  course.  I am 5'1"" and was around 130-140 lbs.  The hem hit below my knee,  but due to my belly and larger bottom half it did occasionally ride up a little."
4.0,"Darn it!!! This dress is beautiful! A little wrinkled, but I don't care. Fits my 38D chest perfectly, but my waist is too big by about an inch for that zipper to close... will order in the next size up, if available. The red is beautiful! I'm 170 lbs for reference and 5'3""."
4.0,I really like it. It is impossible to latch when it is on but doesn't have to be latched to wear it comfortably.
4.0,These feel a bit cheap and the arms are very thin but they look nice and are as described.
4.0,Item arrived before expected and was packaged nice. Absolutely love the skulls.
4.0,"Great dress, very flattering, and good quality for the price. The fabric is a bit thin, but not so see through that it isn't wearable. The lighter part is closer to cream than white, so that also helps the see-through factor. I wore mine with a bandeau."
4.0,Easy to use once you figure it out. Well marked. Seems like a universal size.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress!  The material good quality, soft and light weight but not see through.  It‚Äôs very comfortable and has held up well to washing.  I am 145lbs and 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall, based on previous reviews I decided to order a Medium.  It fit great everywhere in the body, the length was too long for me but the material was very easy to work with to hem it.  My favorite part about the dress is definitely the pockets.  Now when I look to buy I dress one of the first things I look to see is it it has pockets.  As a very busy mom, they have come in handy more than I expected to them to."
4.0,"The purse I received was exactly what was advertised.<br />the Eva Hobo Leather Shoulder Bag Pink was more of a mauve color, but I liked the bag so much that it didn't matter."
4.0,"I wanted to love these pants, but the crotch was a few inches too short, so I called the seller, who gave me a super prompt refund and didn't need me to mail the pants back. 5 stars for customer service!"
4.0,Beautiful but was not super secure. Had to buy it twice.
4.0,As expected. As advertised.
4.0,On time delivery and good material.
4.0,"Go a couple of sizes larger than you would with american sizes and it fits well on my wife.  She likes it, looks good."
4.0,Like it really good
4.0,Very comfortable. Good coverage.
4.0,"really cool ring, I love the design, I wish it were stainless steel so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about water and stuff but it‚Äôs is what it is."
4.0,This is perfect to protect your watch but the only hustle is that it's not easy to turn the bezel. I had to ad one of the custom ones to have a better reach and grip in order to use is properly. I would suggest to provide an adhesive bezel to correct that grip since the protector is bulky .
4.0,"I like the way it looks and how it has aged. Simply the prettiest band I have for my watch. The buckle could be a litte better, but it's overall very good."
4.0,I was skeptical when first purchasing but these are so cute with a crop top. They fit a little tighter in the waste but not uncomfortable
4.0,"Good quality, good size, my ears haven't reacted poorly to them. But the post is a little long, they poke me when I lay down."
4.0,I really liked the dress. The fit of the dress  was relaxing for my evening Gala that I attended.
4.0,Fit well. I am 5'9 and ordered a size 6. I may order more colors!
4.0,It fits as expected if you use the chart they provide. Otherwise the dress is very tiny and the sleeves especially. It is beautiful and soft and it has crocheted fix leaves that are very flattering. It is beautiful.
4.0,It was way more green than I expected
4.0,perfect interview attire really brightens up a teams/zoom meeting
4.0,"This was a very good price and actually a very well made costume. I bought this for my pirate themed wedding this summer and with a few alterations to the hat, it will be awesome. My only complaint is that the dress is very see through but if you wear a white slip dress underneath, it's perfectly fine. The coat is alittle snug in the chest area but I'm going to add a pirate skeleton clasp to be able to hold it closed."
4.0,I love this. It's so me. I am a little disappointed that the silver is washing off after a few days of wearing it but its holding perfect. It's still very silver unless you're looking for the bronze or nickel.  Maybe cuz I forgot to take it off when I went swimming in the lake but oh well. I love it. I wear it everyday.<br /><br />It helps remind me that my spirit fox is with me everyday even when I cant see her. I'm so obsessed with foxes. This is way too beautiful.<br /><br />It got hear with my husband's fathers day gift so it was super great timing.<br /><br />Tiny update: I've had this bracelet for a month now and the tiny discoloration has gotten bad. I do love this bracelet but it turned bronze quickly. I'm more than a little disappointed because I love wearing this. I'm going to find some sort of DIY that I can do to preserve what I have. But I'm not all that happy anymore. I wont change the rating but I will let you my thoughts.
4.0,"The hoodie is warm, fits well, and looks good. I am 5'3 and 120 lbs, the S fit me best if you want to layer a tee underneath. However, the cyber orange is a neon color which was a surprise, it looked like a pale orange in the pic, the other colors weren't available in my size.  Otherwise good."
4.0,This dress is very comfortable while looking stylish.  It can be dressed up or down.  Be sure to use the size chart for the item and you can't go wrong with proper fit.
4.0,I love the color of them. The fit is great! The polarization is amazing.
4.0,"Super cute! Can‚Äôt wait to match it with denim pieces. It holds an iPhone 11, sanitizer and keys. Just enough space. Wish the white was brighter but for the price I‚Äôll take another if needed!"
4.0,"Mask doesn‚Äôt stay on face too well, no ear loops or tight strap. Does look great and still works fine."
4.0,"I originally purchased size XL as the Asian sizing is not US Dad bod sizing. The XL was slightly to large for my 165lb 5‚Äô8‚Äù majestic frame. I kept this XL as I can easily wear a base layer under it for fall/winter rides. I purchased a Large also, this was better summer fit and much shorter in the tail section. I‚Äôve attached picture for comparison XL vs L. Also FYI I‚Äôm married ladies, sorry. Very good for the money."
4.0,A little long. A quick hem makes it no problem.
4.0,"Love Russell hoodies. I ordered this one because of the bright blue pictured. It's actually a very dull gray blue, looks nothing like what the picture shows. No big. I'll keep it."
4.0,It's a beautiful bracelet for the price point. My daughter loves it and wears it every day!!!
4.0,"I knew that these were tight-fitting shirts, and I prefer a looser fit.  So I ordered a size up hoping that would be enough, but it's still form-fitting.  They're great if that is the style you are looking for."
4.0,It looks much more expensive than it is was BUT it is for a LARGE wrist.
4.0,Cute but hard to close on your own
4.0,It actually is much prettier than I thought it would be.  I ordered it to go with a specific blouse and I find myself wearing it with much more.  My daughter who designs jewelry for a hobby was most impressed.
4.0,Love it...one of my favs
4.0,"Pros: Nice and warm even without a battery pack. With the battery back, the vest starts warming up within 5-7min. Within 10-12min the vest gets toasty.  Price for the heated vest is good.<br />Cons: The zipper is not the smoothest- need to slow down and zip it up carefully. Also, it would be nice if the hand pockets had an opening on the side, rather than from the top.<br /><br />I can see myself using this frequently during the Fall weather (40-60degrees F). Good price for a decent heated vest."
4.0,It's a cheap watch and definitely shows that. But overall not too bad. Scratches easier than any other timex I've owned. But a good beater.
4.0,"The color of the shirt is actually more flattering in real than in the picture. It is such a beautiful deep color. This will come in very handy when the weather cools down. I love the stylish cowl neck, and can you ever go wrong with pockets? Now these aren't the kind of pockets that you can put your phone or keys in but I am automatically drawn to shirts with pockets.<br />The sleeves are a bit longer but I don't mind that especially in cooler weather. The material isn't of the highest quality but it still works.<br />Highly recommend!"
4.0,"Okay you're DEFINITELY going to need to go up a size or two. I'm 5'7 and 150 lbs and I got the XL and it fits perfectly, (I'm usually a medium/ large) it's not too tight on me and the fabric is really soft. The rose is embroidered on not printed which is nice because it makes it look a lot more professional, I was a bit weary ordering from China but this shirt is a great deal for less than $5. Before you order keep in mind the rose is bigger than it looks in the photo, but I will be wearing this a lot and shipping was very quick (9 days) the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because the rose is slightly off center but I can just tuck it back, it isn't a big deal (it's also slightly see through so don't wear any bright colored bras). Just remember to go up a size or two and you should be good."
4.0,Bows are a little off but still very cute
4.0,Loove this necklace! It gets tangled very easily of course but it's adorable
4.0,good...^.^...
4.0,"I have thick hair and this hat was super tight when I got it. I wrapped a wet towel around a ball a shoved it in over night. Still tight but looser. I've had to do this a couple times because it seems to shrink back down. I don't wear it too often as I live up north but I did wear it at the beach. The flimsy band broke and almost blew away. I'll probably do what other have and replace it with something pretty. Overall it keeps Sun off head, face, neck and shoulders and I can keep to myself like an antisocial person if I pull it down."
4.0,"Love everything about it except the fact that it's a little too small. Love he color, but I have a hobo wallet and it won't fit at all. Would get five stars if it were a bit bigger. Sadly will be returning."
4.0,It fits but it was too long on me ... had to have it tailored and then on top of that the tailor said it would be too difficult to put the elastic back on the bottom. The off the shoulder look has to be forced it is not cut or designed to fall off the shoulder naturally. It sits even on each shoulder. People gave me compliments but when the elastic was removed it felt a little awkward to me. But that‚Äôs me... tall ladies would benefit from this outfit. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10.5‚Äù and I think I got an XL
4.0,"I love the material, it is soft and the ribbed ends of the sleeves gives it a nice tailored look, perfect for the office. The Olive color is very similar to the picture, maybe just a slight tone lighter but not a vibrant green so it still feel neutral. SIZING: For reference, I am a b-cup but i have a belly that sticks out and wide hips (I'm a total pear shape) and a LARGE in the classic cardigan from Target fits me perfectly. I am a size 12/14. I ordered a 1X to be safe and I'm happy I did since it fits almost just right. It is slightly baggy in the sleeves but if I were to button it up, it is snug around my belly. I leave my cardigans open so that's not a problem.<br /><br />UPDATE: I purchased the charcoal grey one in a Large, 2 sizes down from my olive one. It hugs my arms but isn't tight and the fit looks a little better since it's less baggy.<br /><br />Your best bet is to actually measure yourself and compare it to the size guide the company provides."
4.0,Just a little smaller than my Crocs
4.0,"I already have 2 belts of the same brand, they are great and very durable.  This one is a little bit different color than the picture, its not khaki it is more like light brown but the quality is great like the others"
4.0,Pleased with this order. Very comfortable.
4.0,Pretty but came dirty and glue out of place. However dirt is really easy to remove. Overall beautiful necklace
4.0,"This is a great product if you prefer a money clip/card holder over a traditional wallet. It‚Äôs a little on the heavy side compared to other money clips I‚Äôve owned, but the carbon fiber RFID blocking material is worth it. Definitely a great buy."
4.0,This jumper is so HOT.  The material is cheap - think cheesy halloween costume.  But the shear sleeves and the deep v in the front along with the flashy gold on the cuffs makes for a very sexy look.  Just add high heels and a martini.
4.0,Does it‚Äôs job..fit right.
4.0,They are a little smaller than what I expected but still cute
4.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS! It is soooooo soft and the fact that it has pockets is just that much better! Its a little long on me ( To the floor and I am 5 foot 7 inches ) Super comfortable, great spring dress."
4.0,"It'd pretty and the quality is good. I will keep it, but it will not be a part of my Christmas-day attire. Just doesn't stand out like in the picture."
4.0,"This wallet is of better quality than I expected, especially with the price."
4.0,I ordered two pair. I usually wear small or medium so I got a large and these were still a bit snug. The pouch is meh personally but it makes my booty go üí•
4.0,I am 5'4. 125 pounds. I wear about a 34b bra vs 32c. The small top fit but the small bottoms were a bit too tight. The medium were perfect.  I do wish u could mismatch sizes but I had to buy both.
4.0,Slightly smaller than originals but work well
4.0,"I really like this hoodie. It runs big thou and it doesn‚Äôt have pockets in the front but, it‚Äôs super cute."
4.0,Look exactly like the picture. Very cute and sturdy.
4.0,cool beads
4.0,I bought this to brighten my dad's day up a little bit. He is in the hospital and has to wear an eye patch. It did the job. He got a kick out of it and the nurses enjoyed it too.
4.0,"Neat, well designed medallion for those to whom WWJD sends a strong message as it does to me."
4.0,"Really good quality, awesome key strap. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the clip for it seem kinda iffy, but  it hasn‚Äôt disconnected on me yet. Also it does have a part of the strap a safety break away clip."
4.0,SOFT AND COMFORTABLE. PRICE IS REASONABLE I DO NOT LIKE COLOR TAUPE.
4.0,Cute shirt! Great bargain and fits well!
4.0,"Runs big, I have to return. Very &#34;polyestery&#34;."
4.0,somewhat large but i like it
4.0,"This was an attractive shirt, nice material, good quality, but too small for my husband. We ordered his usual size but it did not fit as expected, too tight in the chest area."
4.0,"Well made, nice fitting waistband, quality fabric - a great value!"
4.0,I love it but too small for my neck which is not large so I had to by extender.
4.0,"Fast delivery, nice necklace."
4.0,Exactly as ordered but the price a little high for even a TH product.  Nothing exceptional but good quality.
4.0,"These are great - I just ordered a second set so I'd have plenty to leave on various necklaces. I wish the links were a little bit smaller, otherwise they solve the problem of pretty necklaces that are just a little too short."
4.0,Not for the curvy girl with hips. I definitely made it work but if you‚Äôre above a size 14 I wouldn‚Äôt suggest! I got an xl and it was on the smaller side.
4.0,I would have loved it more if the arms weren't snug. I have wide arms to it fits snug there but every where else fits comfortably.
4.0,Cute! Just size down one (or two) for a more fitted look.
4.0,I really love this shirt it hasn't peeled yet. So that's good also very true to size also its fun to walk<br />.down the hallway and see who knows who tobuscus is XD
4.0,"Bought this dress to wear in a wedding. The dress is very pretty with thick material. The bust was too big for me (34 - B), so I had to have that taken in. But the length was great and it photographed well. Over all very nice."
4.0,"These pajamas are so sheer and light, it's like wearing nothing at all. I love the royal blue color, it's so striking and deep. At rue royal blue. They are a bit bigger than what I expected but that plays into your favor. I usually get a size large but got these in a medium and they are very roomy but not as much that they would fall off you. I think they are designed to be extra floaty because that very design is what makes them non-constricting. You can toss and turn and roll around in these and they won't catch or bind under your body, very flowy even when in bed.<br />Update: still love the comfort, but the lace part on the top is showing the inner elastic now, it's starting to come out very easily :-("
4.0,"Liked it,  comfortable,  nice stretch. The zipper stuck and broke after 5 months of wear. I always washed it zipped and inside out. Just the zipper is on the cheap side."
4.0,"Dusty pink color. Fits well, true to size"
4.0,"sizing was off for what I thought I needed. Item runs small, order up. Company did work with me for customer satisfaction."
4.0,"Not durable enough for a key chain, but does look cool for display options."
4.0,"I got this with the hope that my husband could use it on one of his vintage film cameras. This will likely work for that purpose. It seems like a full size DSLR with any larger lenses would be much too heavy for it. The leather isn‚Äôt as thick as his other camera strap. The inside material is a layer of suede like padding, the outer leather scratched and ding pretty easily. The thin strap part that is the adjustable section was pretty thin and I think with a heavy camera could stretch out some.<br /><br />The color and appearance of this strap is very pleasing to the eye, we loved that. It is plenty long enough- he‚Äôs 6‚Äô5‚Äù and it sat at a comfortable height on him, something that is often an issue with camera straps. I like the hardware and the color of metal they chose for it. One thing- we may replace the rings that attach to the camera with something thicker or clasp like.<br /><br />This is a very pretty camera strap. I feel like it is an okay value, price wise. We have bought other straps for less money and been satisfied with them, but this will likely stay on his Olympus 35, because it works perfectly for that camera size."
4.0,The seeds are very fine but a lovely little necklace.
4.0,"Overall I love the dress. It represents the beginning of fall and still has the bright summer colors. The top of the dress is see through, so an undershirt would be needed. The belt is strong and comfortable. It is removable if you would rather not wear it."
4.0,Didn't get the bottoms
4.0,Item was broken out of the package. Glued it back together- very pretty when complete.
4.0,"They were beautiful, but the quality wasnt what I expected"
4.0,Ordered this as a gift. Well made and seems to be high quality. My only problem is that the font is extremely small and difficult to read.
4.0,Nice looking gloves.  Seem to be decent quality.  Thumbs are a bit long.  Hopefully they last.
4.0,Liked very much .
4.0,Great except for an inside zipper that stuck. I didn't want to send it back because it was a gift and it took weeks to get here in the first place.
4.0,Really great quality. Love the fit on my nearly 4 year old. The case was also really nice and easy for my son to use. 4 stars was only because the color of the lenses was more orange than red like shown in the picture. But not a deal breaker.
4.0,"Item as expected. Russell sweatshirts/sweatpants have always been a quality product.  A little oversized, but what you want for wearing other garments underneath."
4.0,The quality of this product was quite good. We were quite pleased with the fit also. My wife looks forward to another purchase from this company  sometime in the future!!
4.0,I got mine but did not get the shoulder strap. Not sure how to let them know about this.  So far I like this.
4.0,"I adore the color, it looks great with my skintone!<br />The fabric is very stretchy, and is a bit loose on me.<br />I find it twists and turns on the top where it should be a little more fitted.  I dont wear it as much as I would like due to this. However, when I do, I receive alot of compliments. (And who doesnt like to hear they look nice from time to time!!!)<br />It also gets wrinkled every easily. I would not recommend taking this with you when traveling unless you have a method to remove the wrinkles.<br /><br />Over all I love the style, and the color, I just wish I had gotten a smaller size since there is so much give to the fabric."
4.0,"very cute and nicely packaged, but some imperfections"
4.0,very nice item. looks great
4.0,Size and overall look is great but backs slip off really easily. I‚Äôve almost lost one of them about five times now. I will be replacing the backs with more secure clamps.
4.0,"I like it so far , but I've only had it a few days."
4.0,Comfortable. Looks darker in picture.
4.0,"Hat was a little large, hopefully it will shrink over time."
4.0,Love it soo much. Alil bigger on me than expected! But still a good fit!!
4.0,"I really like this and have been wearing it as a tunic since I don't feel comfortable in anything shorter then knee length (total personal preference, it looks fine as a dress). I like the way it fits and the color. The only thing is I was super excited about pockets, because who doesn't love a good pocket. But now that I have it I find the pockets a bit awkward. The material is thick and does not show every bump of my body (which I love) but it shows the line of the pockets so that looks odd. Then the seam at the top of the pocket is not perfect and I find myself messing with it. It is just a small little thing but it kind of bugs me. I still like it and have enjoyed it just makes me like the pockets a little less. I am sure many people are a lot less picky about stuff like this and think it perfect.<br /><br />I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Love how cute this bracelet is. Arrived fast.
4.0,"The fit was good. The stitching isn‚Äôt perfect, but I love the way it feels"
4.0,It works for what I need it to do! I bought this as a replacement band for my smart watch and low and behold the thing does exactly what I needed it to do. I will say however the pins feel like they are going to fall out at any minute
4.0,"I ordered this dress on Sunday, received today July 4th I'm impressed I got it in a holiday. Any way the dress is super comfy, has pockets, and the length is great for being 5&#34;11 it hangs past the knees. Only complaint is ot does run very big. I suggest you order an extra small if your a small. I am not returning to I'll my to see if I can shrink a little bit in the dryer or wear it with a belt. I would recommend this dress, perfect for hot summer days."
4.0,"These were the real deal, high quality Jimmy Choo sunglasses.  They came in a Jimmy Choo glasses case and included a fabric wipe and were delivered very quickly.  However, the color of the glasses looked like a true gold and black in the photo, but in person were more of a rose gold/brown hue. They are pretty large and sat quite far from my face.  Overall, they are a great price ($400+ at department stores), but the color disparity and general fit led me to return them."
4.0,"The blue is a really pretty.<br />For fit, I bounce between smalls and mediums and based on the size guide I went with a medium. They are a bit baggy behind the knees and in front of my hips. But otherwise not bad. So with that, I suggest only doing low impact activities like yoga. To go running I think they would be too loose and uncomfortable<br />They are comfortable, the material is nice. My friend and I do partner yoga all the time and they were perfect photos and working together. The material wasn‚Äôt too slippery.<br />Overall happy with this purchase."
4.0,Love it! Perfect fit...
4.0,"I just got these a few weeks ago and have enjoyed implementing its use into my leg workout routine. The tension is perfect for me, and I hope the bands continue to hold their elasticity. My legs aren't strong, as I've only been back at the gym for about a month now, so I hope this band continues to be a part of my rotation once my legs are stronger.<br />As a beginner in leg workouts, I definitely recommend this item."
4.0,"Kid like it a lot, just a bit larger"
4.0,"It's a very pretty dress and comfortable, although a little small in size."
4.0,I think these are the best!
4.0,"Very  nice, but run small , i got today and I am returning, today."
4.0,It's a perfect dress!
4.0,Usually wear a size 12 but ordered in a size 14 and it fit perfect
4.0,is ok for newborn baby
4.0,These are super cute! The only thing is that they are very stretchy and don‚Äôt have much support when running. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and have lots of jiggly areas when running and these don‚Äôt compress those areas.
4.0,"Huge 80's Magnum PI fan, wanted a watch that had the same look as Magnum's but for a ln affordable price.  Does the job! All I need is a Ferrari. üòÇ"
4.0,"Very soft, lightweight and comfortable, and the inner lining keeps it warm and doesn't irritate your skin.  This is a great hat."
4.0,"The clip-on sunglasses pretty much work as advertised. I must admit, the clean-hinge arrangement was a real draw, I really like that feature. What I did not realize at the time is that these sunglasses do NOT have a flip-up-feature. I'll keep the convenient case handy!"
4.0,"All five lenses, the case are awesome. But the glasses are no where near as bendable like it says in the pictures. Probably only like 5% as bendable as they say it would be. But it still give it 4 stars because you get a lot for 20 dollars. So it's still a great deal in my opinion."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  It fits well on my ear and it looks great. Would recommend getting it at a cheaper price.
4.0,"I ordered this in a medium. I usually wear an 8 or 10, so I was surprised that this was pretty big in the waist. If I order another color, I'll try a small."
4.0,Was able to fit into mermaid tail perfectly.
4.0,Good but looks cheap
4.0,"This product is really nice, but I got a small which ended up being too small (which is my own fault) but I would've liked the ring to come a little more into the nose. I think if I had gotten a bigger one it would've been more noticible."
4.0,Very pretty. A little small but for the quality and price they can't be beat.
4.0,"Too small, almost sent them back, but decided to hold on to them.  I wear a large, need to order a X-large in these shirts."
4.0,My Wife Loves it.
4.0,Cut too tight around the arms opening.  Nice dress otherwise.  returned the dress.
4.0,"I liked this well made bag, but the opening is not as big as I need. I have lots of stuff! So the bag itself is big enough, but not the opening, which cuts out some space. Color was as pictured, very glossy, pretty bag and far as I can tell, made well."
4.0,"Ordered a medium, I'm 5'4 32c, it fits well."
4.0,"doesn't quite meet all the way around, but really like the case"
4.0,goodÔºÅcolor is beautifulÔºÅbuy blueÔºÅ
4.0,"We were talking about something last night when a huge grin made a good punch line, so I slipped this one on and got a big belly laugh out of my boyfriend. He loves it for work. He'll put a plain black one underneath for good filtration, but this one goes over the ears super-quick. It's just so cute! If nothing else, it will be Halloween and other costume fodder from here on out for many years to come. We really like it."
4.0,haven't used but felt fine when I tried it on
4.0,"Love these, also have them in black. Perfect size, not to big.  One of the earring backs is a bit loose, but over love these!"
4.0,Nice looking hat and was properly packaged so as not to damage it.
4.0,This is a good bra and I would buy from them again. The only thing bad about it is the strings on it. it gets like fuz balls on it but other than that it‚Äôs good.
4.0,This charm it's self is 1cm circumference. The charm is as big as the lobster claw clasp attached. It wears well as long as what you are looking for is petite.
4.0,Shorts are soft and have deep pockets.<br />But they run very big.I normally wear an extra large in pajama pants and shorts but I can easily wear a medium in this one
4.0,Very soft and really a good gift!! I gave this as a gift to my sisters-in-law and she loved it.
4.0,"I love these--I wear them to every practice. I just wish the nubbies extended further on the toe to make the toes grippy, they get lost in the underside of the &#34;knuckle&#34; and you don't get any benefit when doing toe-related things (like up-dog to down-dog, or goddess pose).  Otherwise, great socks!  Will definitely be back for more."
4.0,"Bought to help make my Odeon PM a more comfortable crossbody fit (I‚Äôm tall and plus size). I bought two of the medium ones. They almost didn‚Äôt fit around the rings of the purse but didn‚Äôt work after a little maneuvering (warning- does look like i scratched the metal on my brand new LV by doing so) the gold isn‚Äôt an exact match but closer than another strap option i bought off Amazon. I think the price is a bit high for the quality, but good enough I‚Äôm keeping them."
4.0,I really like these. They're very comfortable.
4.0,"These shoes were purchased for my daughter, size 13 for a special occasion at church.  They are very cute and the length of the shoe fit well.  We returned them, however, because they were very wide.  There was about a half inch gap on each side of her foot.  The flowers on the band were sewn on well and the sole seemed to be non-skid.  The shoes seemed to be well constructed and she thought them very pretty, but since she would have to wear them for an extended time, they were not practical, fit wise.  If your child has very wide feet, these would be good shoes."
4.0,"Perfect for people with gauges! I wanted gauges that dangle, but I'm allergic to many metals. I put in tunnel gauges and clipped these in the hole. Looks cute and doesn't react badly to my ear!"
4.0,Top is a little small for bigger chest
4.0,Everything else I dopie dope except the right sleeve. Something is wrong with it but I'm 2 lazy to describe it.
4.0,Perfect for the beach.  Not super high quality but feel like it will hold up just fine.
4.0,"Great quality and pattern, but a little too distressed. It would be absolutely perfect if they hadn‚Äôt overdone the distressing on sleeves and hemline.  Still super soft and well made."
4.0,"This is really cute, comfy and flowy.  The fabric is comfortable, the style is nice and the color is beautiful.  I'm rating this as &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I did order a medium (no small sizes available) and I'm generally a small.  But for reference, I'm 5'6&#34;, 128 lbs and the medium was too big on me to be flattering.  A small or x-small would have looked really cute though and I'm bummed those sizes are not currently offered."
4.0,It's really cute and comfy. This will definitely make a great cover up on the beach!
4.0,A few doubles but they're still great
4.0,Beautiful!!!! But they hang so low on your ear :/
4.0,It's alright. Little small. But it is was it is.
4.0,"I got this for my 8-yo's birthday. It's so cute, but it is REALLY big. Just make sure you double check the size before you order- it's really big on such a little neck."
4.0,Beautiful suit!  Runs a little big and my six year old struggles with the straps getting it on though.
4.0,"T-shirt material, not thick in any shape or form"
4.0,31/2 stars. It‚Äôs big and warm and comfortable. The thing is silly looking but who cares. The only complaints are that small pieces of the lining are falling out. It‚Äôs also very hard to get back into the storage bag.
4.0,Good for working out and running keeps your body cool and absorbs sweat
4.0,Overall it‚Äôs a great sweater and is very soft inside.. just didn‚Äôt expect it to be so thin!
4.0,I have very sensitive ears but I'm happy to say that I have been wearing the earrings full time for a week now & I have not had a reaction at all! I gave them a 4 star because the posts are a little too long & they tend to poke the back of my ear while laying down. Other than that they are great for the price!
4.0,"The little plastic thing with openings at each end came out of that silver casing and I can't get it back in.<br />So I'm not using the black, but the brown is working fine, and I intend to dye the blue black."
4.0,Muy buena calidad tela
4.0,very nice! too small tho
4.0,A little bulkier than I expected but they are nice.
4.0,"They are larger than I expected but comfortable and nice to look through. Came with a great case, cleaning cloth and image that shows polarization."
4.0,Packaged great and delivered as promised. I got a large and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"These pajamas are so soft, the only quality issue is the brand and size came off in the first wash.  It does not change the quality of the pajamas though.  But we got two different sizes and have to guess which is which size."
4.0,It looks amazing but size was smaller than I expected
4.0,Excellent quality and material. Open back very flatering.
4.0,I love this dress cause it fits perfectly!! And is a good cuality!! Very happy with my dress.
4.0,"Very nice bracelet.  Much prettier in person.  Great quality and it has a pretty thick chain.  The clasp it a good quality clasp, doesnt feel weak or cheap.  Thank you"
4.0,Battery doesn't last long wear it out all day t
4.0,item fits very large
4.0,"Nice, soft fabric. Like the fit. Not too clingy"
4.0,I haven't used this as a toy.  I've attached it to my work badge so that when I'm assessing my patients in the middle of the night I don't have to turn on their large light unless I have to. Thankfully I have 39 more because my coworkers want them too.
4.0,The shoes are very cute and vibrant colored! I don‚Äôt like that the material at the front of the foot started to fray after one use at the beach. The shoes also fit a bit larger but I would take that over them fitting tight on my daughter.
4.0,Gotta love Bamboo!
4.0,great seller but dose not look as good as the pic
4.0,The fit is good and comfortable.
4.0,Product fit as expected. Arrival time was a little long. Only &#34;complaint&#34; I have is the skirt part made a little cheap. However I would order again.
4.0,"I like the colors.  Large fits more like a Men's Medium.  ""Sport"" is spelled wrong on the front.  Light material, good for biking."
4.0,Want to buy this in more colors. I love it!
4.0,I usually wear xxl but my hips are wide and it was too small.  I will return and try the xxxl.
4.0,"Second time ordering from this store and SO happy. The ONLY complaint I have is the tie on the waist is not a real tie so you can‚Äôt adjust it - which I would really love if it was a real tie. Other than that I‚Äôm obsessed with the jumpsuits/rompers from this company. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 120 lbs. I have a really long torso and long legs too - which makes me nervous when ordering rompers. The length on me considering my height was really good! No booty showing. The fabric is so comfortable too. Will definitely order more.<br /><br />PLEASE ADD A REAL ADJUSTABLE TIE AT THE WAIST!!!! :)"
4.0,Returned for different size
4.0,I sent back one size for the size up and it still runs small. The product is well made. Seams all together. I wore it to work Monday and received at least a dozen compliments. This is more of a work dress than a dress up dress........
4.0,"Wow, really lowcut. The socks are well made.  The socks stay on with or without shoes. You get 6 soft, breathable pairs in one package.  The company touts a Moisture Transport System that wicks sweat away from the foot. I haven't noticed it since I'm not walking or sweating a lot. They also claim an Anti-odor technology to stop order. I can tell you they don't smell when I take them off.<br /><br />Easy care: Wash in cold with low heat dry."
4.0,They were bent when I got them but they look like the picture.
4.0,It is sturdy and has a little sparkle and personality to it.
4.0,My name is King so this is the perfect thing for me and I wear it all the time. I just hate how hard it is to put on and off because of the chain.
4.0,I keep losing them or one lol
4.0,"I got this to wear on the boat instead of my ""real"" wedding rings. I do take it off and on because the water stays under it more than my metal ones but it's still comfortable and no worry about losing my more expensive one."
4.0,"Very nice hat! Yes, the front can &#34;flip&#34; down to make it look more like a traditional fedora, but there ends up being a slight  wrinkle in the front brim at that spot. I'm going to see if it can be ironed out a bit. It is hardly noticeable but it might be worth trying to get rid of. I got the small/medium size and it fits snugly but not too tight. Probably will not fly off in a stiff wind. My head size is 22 1/2 inches, so hat size is about 7 1/4."
4.0,"Hoping this is the right size for my 9 year old daughter...purchased box chain for durability...we will see. Rating based on packaging- came out of the envelope in a knot. Very shiny, appears to be decent quality- good price- fast ship!"
4.0,"These cleats beautiful and it fits but it‚Äôs not for you, if you have skinny feet."
4.0,"It's pretty good. It came a few days ago and I was so excited to wear it the next day. Little did I know that it was gonna make me look like a bubble. That's the only con that it seriously makes you look like you are wearing a bubble shirt. Wouldn't suggest wearing it anywhere. It doesn't go with skirts or pants.<br />Now for the pros. The color pink is brighter which I really like. I love neon colors. Not normally pink but for some reason I really like the color of this sweater. Also the inside is like fleece lined. It's so soft and comfy and warm and I just want to curl up into it. It's so soft. The sweater is super comfy as you must have noticed so that's huge pro. I decided I'm going to wear it as a pajama top because it's warm, comfy, and unable to wear in public. I still love it tho."
4.0,soft but a bit too sheer
4.0,My fiancee loved them.
4.0,Adorable but very loose
4.0,"The size is so big ,I think just for big face people"
4.0,"Here's the deal with this bra.  It's not a sexy piece but it's oh, so comfortable.  I purchased this for long plane trips when wearing a regular bra is just downright painful.  Even though there is padding, this will not give you a &#34;sculpted&#34; look like when  you're wearing a high-end  bra.  I use this as my weekend bra when slouching around and need a little bit of support and wear sloppy  shirts.  The pads are removable through a very small opening at the top.  They wash nicely and you can get the pads back in but it's a bit tricky.  For sizing reference I wear a 40 C bra and the 2XL works great with no back fat lines.  After wearing this bra, I will always make sure I have one on hand for weekends and long plane flights.  However, I wouldn't wear this under my works clothes as I feel I have a bit of smashed  boob thing going on.  Definitely work the $10!!"
4.0,"I needed a good leather jacket as protective gear for biking. This jacket is great for riding. It is really light and breathe really well. On top of everything, it is very stylish looking, so I don't have to take it off like I do normally with my riding gear. It doubles as a great fall jacket."
4.0,Could be tighter!
4.0,"Super cute! I'm used to wearing nose rings with jewels but I wanted to switch it up. These lay flat, are the perfect size and are easy to put in and take out."
4.0,"I had my sister order these as a gift for my niece on my behalf, so she could easily work out exchanges if needed. I instructed her to order down, sinxe  *everyone* reviewed saying the shoes run extremely large, like a full size larger.. WRONG. Perhaps there are differences in batches (which isnt a great thing) and a bunch of them were created too large in the past. All I know is my sister told me that the size 9.5 she ordered was the same size as the 9's my niece was nearly grown out of. Given the cost of these shoes, no one wants to pay for a size that's too small or barely fits for a growing little one. Slightly bigger it grow into is always the way to go.<br /><br />Thankfully amazon issued a credit to cover the cost of the shoes skyrocketing from $34.99 to $54.99 (and now 3 days later is $39.99 btw...) since she needed to spend the energy shipping back for a refund and reordering at current cost.<br /><br />It's disappointing the company does not have quality control on sizes... that their size chart varies from amazon and their company website (go take a look over there, also posted pic with my review), and we can't even take the word of reviewers either. I just wanted to make this known to others who value reviews.<br /><br />The shoes themselves are adorable and my niece loves them! I guess all I can say is keep an eye on this prices and know it fluxuates and when it goes low, just buy multiple sizes and return the ones that dont fit....since its free returns. That way you lock in the price you are willing to pay."
4.0,"Would have given it 5 stars but the M fit like an XS. Going to exchange doe an XL and see if that works. The graphic on the shirt is vivid and the quality of the sweat shirt is good. Just runs really small, I couldn‚Äôt even get the shirt over my head barely. 5‚Äô10‚Äù 163lbs."
4.0,We are using these tags for musical instruments. They don't look like other ordinary luggage tags which makes quick identification easier. The variety of styles and quality are great. Highly recommend these luggage tags.
4.0,"My husband is the one who gets to wear this jacket so here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />""Oh I like this.<br />It's not a jacket but more like a sweatshirt with a zip. But the material is really soft and comfortable. It has a collar on it so the zip isn't poking you in the face all day if you leave it open.<br />While there are two zip open pockets on the outside it also has two pouch type pockets on the inside. Nice deep pockets for all kinds of stuff.<br />It feels nice and warm too. I wouldn't advise going out in the cold with it as a jacket but for a cool morning it would be fine.<br />A very nice item.""<br /><br />There you have it. He really likes this a lot!"
4.0,I bought this top for date night and I like the way it fits .
4.0,"Hard to open the first time! I broke the snap right as I was trying to open it. Got it back together and is working ok. Do love that these fit a tall, long waisted, big bellyed man."
4.0,"This thing is adorable.<br />Holds eggs nicely and looks cute while you do.<br />The material is quite thin, like a single layer of fabric...i am a little concerned for extended use, but only time will tell."
4.0,Little thin in the toes but great price.
4.0,Shirt fits great though the sleeves are a tad long. Sleeve length for a single sized shirt will not always fit perfectly--accepted. Material is cool and drapes nicely making a snug fit forming more to the body. Colours are brilliant
4.0,Very pretty. Looks exactly like the picture but it was somewhat small. One size up would have been perfect.
4.0,"Love this womens summer sundress. It looks super cute. I like the criss cross straps in the front. I also think that the floral design on the bottom of the dress very beautiful.<br /><br />It's really puffy, so it's difficult to see through the dress. I would say it's safe. It is a beautiful sundress to wear during the summer though and I will definitely be wearing it!<br /><br />One thing I DIDN'T like was that the strap were elastic. The elastic straps make it a lot difficult because it keeps riding up, having to constantly pull it down makes it so annoying. I got a size small and having the straps ride up make it less flattering than it is. It would have been even more beautiful if the straps were made better.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product free for evaluation in exchange for my honest review. I always meticulously research products items before deciding to spend my hard earned money, so I am honored to be given the opportunity to test these items and provide you the feedback. This includes the positives and negatives of the product, in an attempt to help other buyers make educated purchases. Hope it helps!"
4.0,I expected that all Hurley shirts of the same style would have the same fit. This shirt is pretty good but the arms ate about an inch and a half shorter than an identical shirt of a different color. The cut of the body of the shirt is definitely for a slim build.
4.0,Very comfortable.. The size is exactly as it says and little to no shrinkage when washed
4.0,Good quality (not great) - runs big -  Materials is a heavy - I'd give it a 3.5 if it was an option
4.0,Large fit but my daughter can grow into them!
4.0,"Cute, not bad"
4.0,Its an okay charm. Will not use it on my Pandora bracelet. Heart is not as prominent as in ad. Quick delivery.
4.0,I love it it‚Äôs perfect for my costume I just wish it was a little bigger! Feels like it fits more like a medium
4.0,"These are truly now show socks, as opposed to the ones where you still see a little bit of sock. That being said, they fit more like those disposable socks you put on to try shoes in a shoe store. Once you put shoes on they are great, stay put and work well without showing any sock. It is very difficult to wear these socks without shoes as they consistently slide off. These socks are also thinner than a traditional now show sock so your shoe feels a little bigger."
4.0,MK is the man. Watch is impressive
4.0,"I work in healthcare so any scratches, cuts, or abrasions to my hands that I get while gardening or performing DIY tasks around the house are a real nuisance at work. Needless to say, I use a lot of gloves! These gloves are very soft and comfortable and do a great job of protecting my hands. They have a good fit and finish and seem durable. The rubber-like lining of the palms and fingers are grippy and the fabric stretchy. My hands are about 9 inches in span from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my pinky when spread apart, and the medium size fits as expected. But the same size glove also reasonably fits my mother‚Äôs hands as well which are small (see pics). For $22 for 12 pairs, or $1.83 per, the price is pretty affordable, although, I‚Äôve seen similar quality gloves at big box stores for as low as $1 per pair. Overall, though, pretty happy! 4/5 stars."
4.0,Its comfortable. But i don't need any membership nd give me back my $100 money in my account. Please<br />Im apologies.
4.0,It is what i looking for! but it is too big to me...
4.0,"The band and its 2 enclosed rods fit perfectly. The freely-moving, small black piece (not sure what it's called) does not slide around (I love this). The factory band would let this free-moving piece slide off the end of the band while wearing it, but this band's free-moving piece sort of &#34;clicks&#34; into place and won't slide around on you. My only beef with this band (and it's really small and petty) is that my watch-compass easily off when I take the watch off and hold it by the buckle. So, this band must be just a tad bit thinner than the factory band. But, I fixed this issue with a rubberband."
4.0,"The only reason why Im not giving this pendant 5 stars is because the scarab had some sort of residue... but everything else was perfect... the details, weight and packaging were just perfect. I would be nice that it included a chain, it has been difficult to find a matching chain."
4.0,I was very excited to wear this but then I realized how large it runs. The idea of the design ia very delicate and feminine.
4.0,This swimsuit fits perfectly and the material is good too!
4.0,"Either the size large coat sleeves are too long, or my arms are too short.<br />the_electric_man is nothing, if not a natty dresser. While not cashmere, the fabric of this coat is quite passible. It does come compressed into a rather small plastic envelope, kind of a TARDIS if you consider the bulk of the garment and is therefore rather wrinkled, it's not at all as bad as some of the other commentors have experienced. A modest session of steaming/ironing would fix it up. There is also a bit of sloppy loose threading, but again this is easily fixed. The jacket is supposedly washable which is a great advantage.<br /><br />No one is going to confuse this article with a Cifonelli or a Cesare Attelini, but I doubt you're going to be hanging with anyone who could. If you can, invite me to one of your parties. Especially if your a tall, slender Scandinavian blonde, (Just kidding,  well not really.)<br /><br />On the whole, considering the price, I'd recommend this rag. I was conflicted about returning it. Maybe I'll try again if they lower the already reasonable price a bit.<br /><br />Ciao fashionistas!"
4.0,The waist is a bit smaller better for children under size 8. I did like the design and array of colors. They had done well for the price
4.0,This is a good buy. True to size
4.0,"Assemble wasn‚Äôt hard but the instructions weren‚Äôt that easy to follow so basically you just look at the pictures and figure out what to do cause it‚Äôs easier than reading. But overall a great trampoline, my 5 year old‚Äôs first trampoline and the 10 ft one we got fit the space perfectly. I love the fact that the net doesn‚Äôt cover the springs part around the jumping mat so it feels safer. I was wondering if the cover is hard as it shows in the pictures cause it looks neat and nicer but no, the cover is just the regular cover similar to other trampolines, so I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"Was in a bad car wreck 8 months ago and have had surgery around my left ankle 5x, most recently a bone graft to the tibia. These socks work pretty well for helping to keep the swelling down during the day"
4.0,"Pure Neatsfoot Oil without added conditioners and stuff you don't need.. I have revived two leather jackets with this and still have half a bottle left.  It worked best on the full grain pebble-finished leather, and not as well on the really worn bomber jacket.. because I originally followed advice to &#34;use a paintbrush to apply it to the leather&#34;... bad idea!  This oversoaked the leather.  Best to use a soft cloth to wipe it on gradually.  I'm sure this Neatsfoot Oil will have many uses on shoes and boots as well when the weather turns.  Just apply sparingly."
4.0,"Shirt is nice, Fits comfortably- the material is soft and thin (sheer) blue. Fast and prompt shipping from the seller. This product met my expectations, I've had this shirt for over 6months and still use it."
4.0,"This material is extremely thin and the dress has no lining. I will keep it because it's pretty and has a cute style, but I will not buy another one. The skirt falls flat without a petticoat, but that's fine by me."
4.0,Too big but I like it
4.0,"Great weight, great look, cool skeleton design, however my specific watch runs slow. Am looking to return it before rating it a 5 star"
4.0,"I use these to hold my masks when I go out.  The little loops allow me to drop my mask when I don't need it, it stays around my neck  and then to put it back into place when I need it"
4.0,"Is very Nice but I bought too large ,the color is very bright and beautiful"
4.0,"Definitely worth it, I love the necklace."
4.0,I would have rated this 5 stars if the magnets that hold the hand straps together were stronger. They rarely stay together when you set the bag down. Would still still buy again and recommend for the money.
4.0,I bought this necklace as a gift (actually bought a second one after I recieved the first one) and both the ladies I gave it to raved over it. The strands a re lovely and hang well. Additionally the clasp is a button type situation and both women commented on how easy it was to put on amd use instead of the traditional small metal clasp style. They were very well recieved and because of the variety of colors in them it looks great with lots of outfits.
4.0,"Geniales, parecen c√≥modas y baratas"
4.0,I loved the way it fit in the body. I bought the smallest size but my bust is a 32 DDD so the cups didnt fit my breast without showing more cleavage than I wanted to. I loved the feel and the construction was nice. But unfortunately I returned the item.
4.0,Bought 3 of these and I love the feel and fit but I can't get the creases out from when it was packaged.  Washed and ironed the heck out of them to no avail.  Guess I'll have to Google how to get those creases out.
4.0,"I bought this apron to use during my D√≠a de los MuertosüíÄfestivities. The fabric quality is good and it‚Äôs very comfortable, I‚Äôm only giving 4 stars because i<br />I would love if it had pockets at least in my opinion. I plan to use it all year, since the colors are so happy and vibrant. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.<br />Btw I am 185lbs 5‚Äô7 and it fit very well!"
4.0,super cute dress and it fits good to me. perfect for a summer wear
4.0,Fast shipping. Look good
4.0,the only thing I did not like was the walking vent in front.
4.0,"Well, you didn't order it for the looks. It does stick out a bit like a duck bill. But I really can sing with it on. It's extremely comfortable."
4.0,I'm satisfied for the most part
4.0,"It's a skinny tie...but other than that, the material is nice and the delivery was prompt."
4.0,"Nice quality, but &#34;XL&#34; is more like a medium."
4.0,"I was hoping this would be impressive, and would have paid more if it had been.  It's nice leather, and my husband liked it, but it just didn't make me ooh and ahh like I'd hoped.  Functional, decent, should hold up ok."
4.0,"Very cool, but they were adult size.  I was expecting a youth size considering the product is juvenile."
4.0,Not sized right for USA sizing chart
4.0,"I really like that is has RFID blocking!  But, I wish it had an outside pocket for my iPhone."
4.0,"Is way different, photo look like a light blazer.  Is more like a<br />lightweight shirt with no bottom,even the style is way off."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I usually wear it in the spring, autumn, or winter because it has such thick material that it does tend to be a bit warm. It is great to dress up or down but the color isn't true to the description which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I'm 5'1"" and weigh between 140 and 160 pounds."
4.0,"All the reviews said these fit small, so I got the large size. I am a fit/muscular woman who wears a 34-A and usually gets medium shirts. Large was too big! Go with the size you usually get."
4.0,"Fits great! The jacket was a bit small for my thick arms which is fine, it still fits and looks good. The zipper snapped while zipping it up but it was an easy fix, I'll be more careful next time. You can also tell the gloves weren't well made but no biggie"
4.0,The color is more of a dusty rose than a lighter pink like the picture suggests.  It was a thick material that I don't think breathes too well so it will be warm to wear for that reason.  It is decently soft but I didn't really like the way if felt when worn but it isn't bad either.  Honestly I would like them a lot more except you have to wear very low cut underwear with this or it will be visible in the back.  I purchased an XL and I thought it was true to size.  I didn't have any problems with it being transparent or anything but I don't have a huge butt or thighs either.
4.0,"Love them! Fast shipping as well. One review mentioned it wouldn't fit for like kid size which I also wish they had, is more adjustable because Mine is just a bit big for my wrist. Other than that, they are great! thanks!:)"
4.0,"This ring is really nice, love the varied metal tones"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very nice sweatshirt,heavyweight &  fully lined but it runs extremely small. I bought this for my husband who wears a size L. I wear a women‚Äôs size medium and it just fit me, so I had to return it. I think you‚Äôd have to go up 2 sizes"
4.0,Really pretty but its a bit thinner and shorter then I thought it would be.  I also found it to be a bit smaller - particularly in the sleeves.  But I can wear it and it is pretty.
4.0,"Cute but i wish yhe pearl was smaller, more danty and the necklace shorter - otherwise..cute necklace..esp for the price"
4.0,Good material and feels good quality excited to take out on the trail but the beanies do fit my head a little weird personally
4.0,It is actually very nice.  The sheer sleeves adds are nice and the cut fits well.  Will be attractive when a short cover is desired.
4.0,"these are just cloth gloves with additional grip<br />I was just looking for gloves to keep my hands a little more clean and soak up sweat.<br />Will not protect you from anything sharp!<br />Would NOT use for auto, HVAC, warehouse, woodworking,  construction, or  shop working.<br /><br />Okay for box handling, precision assembly, light gardening, utility indoor & outdoor activities."
4.0,I like it.  I was very skeptical that it would just fall apart once I put it on but it held up very nicely.  I always go down a size because of my experience with broomstick maxi skirts especially because I'm short so that I don't trip with or without heels on.
4.0,Size 8 fits my tall 7 year old good. Pretty fancy dress for the price.
4.0,Very cute design great fabric runs very small
4.0,Great material! A little wide fit at the bottom
4.0,I am glad I got these. They help in pool workouts! They dry back to shape. Great color. Only they run a bit big & wide. Otherwise perfect. No slipping of you order your size.
4.0,I got this for her and she instantly started wearing it with a black vest I had also purchased.  She is in the 6th grade and has excellent taste.  The size was perfect.  We got some cute little pins to put on the hat band for her different moods.It is a nice quality and brushes up easily.
4.0,Great buy. Beautiful and very comfortable.
4.0,"Like the material and design. Did not like how long it took to receive it and the high postage. It also is NOT a slim fit, very loose around waist."
4.0,Good quality and finish for the price...
4.0,"I am very happy with the overall quality of the shirt, but the sizing seems to run a bit small."
4.0,"I really love the material and the flower print. However, what did surprise me was that there are no buttons to close off the dress. It's just a dress that wraps around you and you have to tie it off with the belt. I didn't see anything regarding this in the description. I'm going to customize it and add buttons to it though. Beautiful and worth the price however."
4.0,I got them for my costume they look like the picture and they should stay put all night.
4.0,Very nice leather was used which is nice.  Doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. Strong magnets on money clip. The keychain feature is cool on it.
4.0,"Very cute tie dyed short set. My granddaughter was really excited to get the set but we found that the shorts are very short and it will be best suited to wear around the house.<br /><br />It is made of 95% Cotton and 5% Polyester.  It is suppose to be soft, but my granddaughter found it to be a little rough and scratchy. We‚Äôve washed it several times and she is now okay to wear it.<br /><br />She loves the tie-dye colors and that it is easy to pull over her head. The shorts have full elastic waist and are comfortable to wear."
4.0,"It works fine and I like it, but it is too big for my wrist and it slides around and I can't adjust it. Also it collects dust or fuzz."
4.0,"Very cute, good quality as far as I can tell so far."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:42d22a5e6c8e9353040d5ff17ddd1a56]] I thought the anklet was very cute and simple, but for some reason when I received it the tone of it seemed kind of dulled. I have worn it a few times and it hasn't tarnished much so that is the best part and the design is simple enough that it goes with a lot of my outfits.  My ankle isn't petite so the sizing was perfect but for someone smaller there is no way to  adjust further than the extension chain.  The design part of the anklet comes out to be 22cm and the extension is 5cm."
4.0,I love these but they bend easy
4.0,Fused glass pendants
4.0,My kids think these a funny and cute. There are Great for dress up days. Only issue is that the nose wire in the Rudolph mask is in the chin side of the mask not the nose.
4.0,"I bought this swimsuit for the top more than the bottoms, knowing I had high-waisted bottoms that fit me better. I will not be wearing the bottoms but they seem ok. they don't go up as high as typically expected for high-waisted bottoms. top is more coverage for what I need and I like it. I took the extra padding out and it seems ok without it."
4.0,I am happy with the earings they are very small but perfect for the 8 year old I got them for. I am very dissapointed that they came in a plastic bag inside a velvet bag they are pictured in a box in the pictures and I will go back and read the disruption again but now I have 2 weeks to try to find ab earing box so I can wrap this Xmas gift.
4.0,The prints are very pretty and a nice variety. The material is soft and gentle for a baby‚Äôs skin. The price was excellent.
4.0,Great looking shirt just a heads up if you're xl like me get the xxl. Runs a tad small. Get the next size up
4.0,The clasp isn't the best it has fallen off once.
4.0,"The leather is very soft, all my items fit in the wallet without any problems.  A perfect size for my purse."
4.0,"This ring is gorgeous. It's a little thicker than I anticipated, therefore more snug than an actual size 9, which is normally a tad loose on my  middle finger. All in all I like it, I'll wear it often, I'm sure. The size is pretty close to a guy's ring, though, so be mindful of width, depth, etc."
4.0,"I really really love the way these leggings feel, THEY ARE AMAZING!! The only down fall and the reason I‚Äôm rating them a 4 is because I ordered a top from them as well, both in the color Rose red and they don‚Äôt match. I ordered the two items specifically so I could have a matching set and they are just slightly a different color. I am still very satisfied with my purchase and will be definitely ordering again. Just be cautious if you are looking for the exact same color"
4.0,"Cute summer, beach dress. I'm using as a cover up for the beach primarily but could be dressed up. I am busty  (34DDD) so I would definitely have to wear a camisole under it since it is very open. It is a true wrap dress, I ordered the Medium which is a little long (I'm 5'1)"
4.0,"it's ok ,  I like it"
4.0,Followed the sizing guide but gloves are a little tight. Hoping they will stretch some over time.<br />Very well made and very warm. if in doubt go with a larger size if you are in between on sizes.<br />Well worth the $$
4.0,"It is a lovely looking pendant . I gave it only 4 stars because, I think it is over-priced for the actual quality of the piece. It is a thin, flat and light weight piece. The chain is disproportionately thin for the size ( not weight) of the pendant ; purely aesthetic flaw."
4.0,Que las mangas sean muy largas
4.0,Love it! It's super cute and highlights a small waist I gave it 4 stars only bc the buttons gap at the bust a little but that happens to me alot. I have DD and tops r always tight across my bust
4.0,These socks are even better than I expected.  I couldn't recommend them more highly.  Went through washer and dryer perfectly.
4.0,I am normally a sm-med but ordered an XL because of my chest sz so glad i did it fits good looks cute on good shirt just make sure to order a sz or two up
4.0,"Weighs nothing, but you can pack a bunch.  Will make an excellent carry on bag.  My only complaint is the shoulder strap is a bit thin and uncomfortable.  I would still recommend the bag."
4.0,"I really like the feel of this shirt, although the fit was a little tight -- you might want to size up!"
4.0,Warm and fit well. Delivery was made as promised.
4.0,"These sandals are not only unusual with the large, colorful stones, but comfy.  However, they are a bit too wide and I would have preferred more of a platform.  Still I enjoy wearing them and they're also ""ice breakers"" due to their happy effect."
4.0,"The Fordham logo is more pink than white, but the hoodie fit perfectly and it's a nice material."
4.0,"I'm always leary when I purchase clothing online, the last time I purchased my size that I wear, it didn't even come close to fitting. So this time I ordered two sizes up and it fit perfectly. I love it!"
4.0,It sticks and it stays even through sweat but i felt it was either bigger fit than expected or hard to get the support effect.
4.0,Face is a little bigger than I thought.
4.0,A little loose for me but generally pleased.
4.0,Light could be brighter
4.0,"Great watch, but..... I bought this watch for my 90 year old  dad, who is nearly blind and is hard of hearing. While it is a great watch, he could not hear the audible announcement of the time, so I had to return it. I was shocked to find out that through UPS is cost nearly 23 dollars to return, as it must be returned to England, which is international shipping costs. Ouch! So, original shipping cost was nearly 10 dollars, return shipping was 23, for a total of 33 dollars, for an 85 dollar watch. (The purchaser has to pay for return shipping.)  Also, as this watch is made in England, the &#34;announcer&#34; (of the time) has an English accent, kind of cool, but it makes it slightly harder for an older person to discern what is being said."
4.0,"These are comfortable, but run way to large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 128lbs wear a size 2 and the smalls were way to big. I‚Äôm keeping them because I don‚Äôt want to deal with a return. But definitely size down. They go up really high in the back, not flattering at all. I have their thong ones in a small and those fit just fine."
4.0,I made the mistake of paying attention to the picture size rather than the actual size.  They were a bit smaller than I anticipated. BUT they are very pretty and were received quite well.
4.0,"I loved this wallet. My only issues was not having enough items to put in it while I traveled! However, I am now using it as a daily wallet and it works wonderfully. It isn't quite long enough to store the length of a plane ticket, but that isn't a huge issue."
4.0,"If you workout and have pretty thick thighs, these might be a little snug."
4.0,This was a great buy ! I bought a medium and its perfect... I usually wear a size 6 or medium in tops.  I am 5‚Äô2 and 135.  Just wish it was a little longer but overall a great purchase and it‚Äôs adorable on!
4.0,A bit too see-through .  Had to find a slip to wear underneath.
4.0,It's a bit big but absolutely beautiful.  Worth tge price
4.0,"I ordered the cute kitty skeleton mask thinking the design was actually embroidered on the fabric base of the mask  However, when I received it it today it is simply a printed design on the black background fabric. Hence 4 stars. I was hoping it would be a cotton fabric ( this is August in Texas) but it is polyester inside and out. Also there is no inside filter pocket if anyone is wondering.  But it does fit fairly well, has adjustable ear loops and it is very cute."
4.0,"I enjoy changing the  bands to different colors, with no trouble."
4.0,Shirt came in 2 days. Nice quality and great value.  I would buy again
4.0,This is exactly what I thought it would be.  It was inexpensive and looks/feels it but served the purpose perfectly.
4.0,These are great compression leggings and the perfect length I love them for Cycling or leg day!
4.0,Glad I read reviews and ordered larger size than nirmal. Was better quality than expected for the price.
4.0,I love this bracelet but it is just a tad too big and there is no way to adjust it.
4.0,"As expected, genuine merchandise, looks great and very well made. As with all Porsche merchandise, there is a big premium for the name. Removed  1 star because the neck area is a bit on the small size. Fits as expected in all other areas."
4.0,"This is a cute t-shirt.  It is a beautiful green color.  It fits big, so we've had to put it in the closet for a while."
4.0,Flattering dress that is comfortable and practical.  I would buy it again!  Fits as expected.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äôand it graces the top of my feet
4.0,"The tote is very nice, I would give it five stars however I didn't like the color in the seams. It looks pink so I will return it."
4.0,Too long by 4 to 5 inches.  No petite length.  Very comfy.  Slippers keep me from stepping  on them. All in all ok
4.0,This dress is perfect for you tall ladies! finally we have a break through for dragging floor length dresses! The straps coming out of the holes was my only issue but the length of this dress for Giraffes like me is sooooo awesome
4.0,Comfortable and very supportive. Stylish colors. Good for the overpronator like myself.
4.0,"Material wasn't what it looks like, but I still like it."
4.0,"5'10&quot;, 155lbs here, and I typically wear a medium jersey. Per reviews here of Paladin jersey's in general and this jersey in particular, I ordered a medium, large, and XL. The medium fit quite good, almost exactly like a medium Voler Race jersey...which is a tighter, race fit. A little higher up in the front and lower in the back, probably meant to be used with bib shorts. Now comparing these Paladin's to my Amazon sourced medium Tenn Mens coolflow 'relaxed fit' (loose club fit) jersey, the Large Paladin is similar in the chest area but still tight in the waist, and the XL Paladin in huge in the chest and relaxed at the waist like the Tenn Mens.<br /><br />The zipper on these Paladin's is junk, I can see how it could break very easily. You have to take your time with it, very thin plastic. And the zipper  slider itself is on the wrong side, quite odd. The fabric is a little scratchy but definitely not bad for $20. Pockets seem nice and deep, good elastic keeping them closed. Quality of the graphic on the outside is pretty great, but the tag area on the inside collar indicating size/material/care is bloched out &amp; unreadable. Overall, this should be great CX kit that I won't mind damaging."
4.0,Pretty and nice sparkle
4.0,I like em and think I look pretty good em if I must say so myself. Still haven't tried them on during sunlight to really test out out it performs blocking out the sun.. All in all as far as looks is concerned it passes the eye test
4.0,"Leather is nice and has seem to held up well through a number of wearings.  It is a padded band, but not very thick, so if that is what you are looking for, this would be an excellent fit.<br /><br />It strikes me as a good match for an auto racing themed watch, which is what I have it paired to (a Porsche Design Boxster chronograph)"
4.0,My husband and I used these socks on our recent flights to Europe and were very happy with them.  They are thick and provided good support without feeling like they were constricting.
4.0,The boot is beautiful BUT the opening is for an extremely large calf.
4.0,The dress is beautiful but to large in the chest and under the arms it goes well
4.0,They worked fine for my 100 year old costume for the 100th day of school. Would have fit a child better though.
4.0,This is just as beautiful In person as it is on the picture. It was a gift for someone and they love it
4.0,the pj s are nice and well made. They are small for the size and the hat is not even close to the size of the outfit.  But the hat does stretch out to fit after some work.  He is still wearing this piece for night time.
4.0,It's a nice shirt except for that the white netted base cloth for sequins shows prominently and is not even neatly stitched around the border.
4.0,Bigger than I thought. Nice solid piece of jewelry for the money
4.0,"Nice, but not as high quality as I had hoped for (chain feels thin)."
4.0,"When I bought this, I wasn't completely sure that I would like it.  However, after a few weeks, it has really grown on me and I enjoy using it.  My main points for considering this wallet was that I do not use cash as much as I used to and that I was tired of having to replace my credit/debit cards because of them getting cracked and broken.  It's still a little awkward for me to get the cash out of its slot, but I feel that is mainly due to the fact that I've never owned a trifold wallet before.  I can fit my credit and debit cards in the metal housing and my lesser used cards (such as medical insurance, etc.) in the leather pockets.  When necessary, I can even tuck a couple extra dollar bills in one of the leather pockets.  I've been trying to better organize myself and this wallet has been a good investment in helping to keep my clutter to a minimum."
4.0,Very bulky but very warm
4.0,Ok quality. Can improve the leather. Good thing is it is adjustable. Why shvigel logo on inside of the band only ?
4.0,But just as described
4.0,I love the look of this band but I am a little rough on my watches and the chrome part that attaches to the fit bit scratches real easy. Mine was scratched with in a couple of days of receiving the band.
4.0,"A little smaller than I had thought, but beautiful."
4.0,"Nice earrings at a great price point, and the sparkle sure doesnt hurt"
4.0,The dress fits nice.
4.0,"Very nice, very heavy fabric, I went one size up from my regular as suggested but I really needed to go 2 sizes up. Not as high waisted as I like."
4.0,Lo ligero y practico
4.0,The fabric was amazing feeling. It is a bit long but I will buy wedges to remedy that. It is a beautiful blue color. Cant wait to wear it out.
4.0,Look bad@$$ on my gf‚Äôs cute lobes. It lost a star because one of the back came broken. The gf has some alternative backs so meh.
4.0,Ok. Not as durable as anticipated
4.0,"Pleased with the shoe, however the sizing is off.  The shoe is actually longer in length than a Youth size 12 as compared to a Nike.  This shoe size is closer to a 13 vs. 12."
4.0,I like this coat.
4.0,"These fit nicely, just wish they had an attached panty. Great to find colored bottoms, instead of the common black!"
4.0,Love this top but the shoulders fit strangely. Also green color easily fades in the wash which makes the string a different color from the shirt. Overall worth it for the price.
4.0,"Beautiful, but the large stone wiggles a little."
4.0,Good price for a nice watch
4.0,"I loved the necklace! It didn't disappoint at all. It was a little heavier than I expected, but love it!"
4.0,This bracelet is good for the price however one of my beads came off within a weeks time.
4.0,:) Nice!
4.0,"Now the kids too have a square smartwatch to match the adults, only this one is kid-friendly!!!!"
4.0,"My only negative is that no warranty paperwork came with the watch, so if I have a problem, I'll have to dig up the information.  Love the cute can it came in. Now for the watch. It was a little bigger and chunkier than I expected, but is a very attractive watch. Style works well for all occasions. Love the 11-year warranty! Seems to run fine. Another great feature is the adjustable links feature of the band - just remove a link or two until it fits! I have only worn this for about 6 weeks or so, but I'm quite satisfied so far. I'm a bit hard on watches - I only take mine off to shower, otherwise it's on me all the time - so we'll see how it performs over time. I wore my last watch for 7 years - still ran well but crystal was scratched & chipped so I decided it was time for another."
4.0,Feels and fits perfectly.
4.0,"It's perfect for hot summer days. I get tons of compliments and I feel like I'm looking good, even though it's the easiest thing to wear."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loved the shirt, but it was a little snug on her which was disappointing.. I wish they had a size bigger. I came a day early just in time for her top concert. She was so excited."
4.0,"Slick material, straps are very dainty, fits looser than expected"
4.0,"Ordered mediums since I knew large might have been too big for me. However because of how thick my thighs are, they fit just a bit tighter than I would have liked, but not so tight that they can't be worn all day. The material is comfy and doesn't restrict my movements at all."
4.0,"Loved this dress for my daughter. Read the reviews, they all said mostly what I expected. Uh dress fit my daughter beautifully, just a little long, but was altered. Only thing we didn't like was the design on the neckline. It was beautiful as well but poorly designed around the center. The floral beading rubs your neck where it is over the chest. Wish they would change that, but we trimmed it off and it worked great for our wedding!"
4.0,very very nice but very dainty. i don't expect them to last too long
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up. It is beautiful !
4.0,I loved the feel of the material but top was too small.
4.0,Would be a 5 star but the silver coating came off of one of the rings.
4.0,"I love it, except the color has faded very fast."
4.0,fits fine a tad short for height 6ft 8in
4.0,I need this bra for my strapless dresses.
4.0,it broke within the first week
4.0,"Nice glasses, good for the price."
4.0,They where awesome for the rave! Would recommend. But there is no sizing option so they where a little big.
4.0,I love this robe but the small / med. size fits more like a regular small size.  The fabric does soften when laundered.
4.0,Nice shoes. Size runs a bit small. My feet swell from diabetes. Sometimes I just can't squeeze into these. Suggest you buy a size or two larger. I had to return the first pair. Great customer service. No hassel prepaid return postage..
4.0,"Original:Super easy install even used the packaging to store the original band and hardware. It feels really good, an improvement by far<br /><br />Updated 05/21<br />I am still wearing this band because I love it but I‚Äôve had a few scares of it getting knocked off due to it bumping into things. I almost lost my watch today due to this so as much as I like it I‚Äôm looking for an alternative and do not recommend  it at all spend a little extra money if you work with your hands.."
4.0,"This is a pretty skirt. The material is nice. The only downfall was that the waistline is more tapered, so I could not zip it up all of the way."
4.0,"Great quality, but too big for me. If you have small wrists, I wouldn't buy these."
4.0,I had ordered an XL for my grandson for Christmas in this sweatshirt.  Two days before Christmas my order arrived and it was a LARGE which was very disappointing. I doubled checked my order to make sure I had ordered an XL and I had. I then reordered the top for him and this time we did receive the correct size in the XLARGE and he was so pleased because he has been waiting to receive his Christmas gift. He really likes it because the last few times I have seen him he is wearing the sweatshirt.
4.0,"This cap reminds me of a baseball cap without the bill. Has a baseball cap adjustment band, and is very different from a hand knitted kufi cap!"
4.0,"My husband loved this watch, it was his favorite. It did however fall of the band and shatter but he got a lot of use out of it prior to that."
4.0,"Comfortable athletic shoe,  good for the gym (ellipical, tredmill, etc.) Fit is good, and shoe is really lightweight and comfy."
4.0,I live the material that they are made of and they are really comfortable.
4.0,"Could use a little more padding in the sole, otherwise very comfortable"
4.0,These have proven to be the most comfortable watch bands I have worn.
4.0,Very cute wristlet its a little smaller than expected. Its more the size of a wallet. Very well made. I will recommend if you are looking for a smaller wristlet.
4.0,"Bought these to use with a shirt for a wedding.  They are simple and the detail is great. They are very classy looking.  If an Iron man fan, highly recommend."
4.0,Not as sharp as it seems.
4.0,"It was a very pretty shoe but it seemed to have run a little to big for my daughter.<br /><br />Please, let me know if this review helped you!<br /><br />Thanks"
4.0,Pretty designs
4.0,"This mask is smaller than what appears on the model. I stretched it a bit for comfort. OK for backup, but don't wear it all day like some others I have."
4.0,"My kids begged me to order this as a Valentines present for my wife and I happily obliged. Personally, I felt it had a bit too much going on, but the little ones felt it was perfect. I was honestly surprised with how nice it was when it arrived. While I think it's a bit on the tackier side, the letter is cute and the pendant doesn't look as busy at a slight distance. For the price, it's a fun piece of jewelry."
4.0,The first pair I received already had a scratch on the lens. They look cool otherwise.<br />I contacted the seller and they sent me out a new pair within a day. Thanks!
4.0,"The print is super cute and the fit is exactly as I expected. True to size. The top is just a bit more narrow than I thought but I love it still, definitely recommend Zaful bathing suits!"
4.0,You know even inexpensive watches can be classy?<br />It's not just about looks but also function. This is a nice watch for dress and even everyday. I love to collect different watches and change the style everyday and this one is perfect for my needs. A classic black faced dial with a bright white second hand. the only part I would have liked to be different was that the hour and minute hand does not appear as detailed as the description pictures provided. I needed quite a bit of light to be able to see them clearly. The minute hand is accented red and the hour hand is a white stripe. It keeps time well and of course was very easy to set. The band is leather like and the clasp works with no issues. I received this watch free as a promotional sample in return for an honest evaluation and review.
4.0,I am a fan of these styles!
4.0,"After a few weeks of use, the shiny finish started coming off, but it was expected. Still very pretty and still wearable."
4.0,These pants are super comfy and fit great. I want them in more colors.
4.0,"Wife likes the dress, but the dress length is a little too short."
4.0,Love it fits nicely üëèüèªüëèüèª
4.0,Good quality.  Got lots of compliments.
4.0,Compatibility and durability
4.0,"These are definetely fun shoes. And by fun I mean to go out in but not stand or walk or dance in for more than a couple of hours. The heels are very high and I am used to high heels. But than again all these platform shoes nowadays are like that. Accept it or don't be fashionable. Although they are not real suede they do look nice. I was afraid they might be a little ""trashy"" but they are OK. Exactly what I expected for this price and am glad to have gotten them. The size is true. The opening around the ankles is a bit wide but then again I have thin ankles and calves."
4.0,The material of the dress was a little rough and rubbed my skin the wrong place where the straps where on the top.<br /><br />Fit me cute tho!
4.0,I love the soft material. I was hoping that I could wear this dress to work but the slit is a bit to risky.
4.0,"Love love the ring, wish Stone was larger"
4.0,"i Noticed people where having trouble with the mask. Ok so first of there are some notable flaws, like I think the straps might be a bit too short but they are elastic so that‚Äôs ok. Now the big issue is eye sight and people say you can‚Äôt see out of it. Well you got to look very carefully for the protective cover that‚Äôs very hard to see, so peel very carefully then you will see a very thin layer of the protector on the eye lens. When you put it on and it‚Äôs blurry, that‚Äôs the protector you need to peel off. Hope this helps anyone who bought this. As for the foam I don‚Äôt know if you need to take that out or not, I read it briefly in the info for this mask. So I will look into that after I right this."
4.0,so cute and very detailed
4.0,These little earrings are good for the price. I have had them in for almost two weeks and they still look good. Haven't irritated my piercings yet!
4.0,It's good üëç
4.0,The scarf is knitted and has texture to it that you don't see in all scarves. It is easy to wrap this around your neck and it will look great with anything. There are no hanging tassels to get caught in anything. You could probably wrap it a couple of times for extra warmth.
4.0,For the price they are they are comfortable and I  used it for work
4.0,too large for my ears but looks good on my daughters since she has  larger ear lope
4.0,"I was hoping these wouldn‚Äôt be too big for a 1yr old but they were. However, he liked playing with them and bending them, and I was impressed that that didn‚Äôt snap. We liked that they are polarized. Overall would recommend for a child over the age of 2."
4.0,The item is exactly as pictured and described. My only issue is the the clasp is hard to open sometimes.
4.0,Took forever to arrive but I like the product. It broke in the back but I just sewed it back together.
4.0,Great golf shirt. Holds well in the wash. Holds its shap
4.0,"I really like the silver and multi color sparkly ones, the purple that i was so excited about is VERY dark, almost a black/purple. One broke after a couple months continuous use.  Good thing I had another one in this pack to replace it."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô8 weigh about 230 I ordered the 2x. It‚Äôs a beautiful dress, true color (burgandy) the lace front is gorgeous I wore it to work everyone loved it."
4.0,The only reason this got 4 starts was because one of the straps on the side was sewn on twisted. You can hardly notice though.
4.0,This top is just slightly too big in the body and very baggy in the arms. I‚Äôve never ever had a problem with tops being baggy in the arms. The zippers for the pockets are long making it easy to put things in them.
4.0,"I see great in these, and love the look! I get a ton of compliments when I wear them. Overall they seem like a great buy. However, one of the arms did bend after just a few days of use, so durability could definitely improve."
4.0,Loved the length and that it didn‚Äôt show cleavage. The material is a little rough & I feel could become itchy & annoying if I‚Äôm hot. I live in Florida so it‚Äôs always hot here lol. But over all happy with the purchase since I spent less than $10.
4.0,"This pair of sunglasses is polarized. The package contains a test card to test its polarization.  I like the shape and material, and it is stylish. I purchased the black/gun, and the color of the legs is actually brighter than it appears on the website, more like a black/silver.  I would have chosen the black/silver if I have seen the real color<br /><br />I bought this pair for driving, replacing the old ones that became blurry due to scratches on the glass. It works well to reduce the sunlight.<br /><br />I do have one complain after wearing it for long period. The legs are a little too tight and they press against my head, and it starts feeling irritating if I put it on over 30 mins. Maybe it is because I have a big head LOL."
4.0,It‚Äôs a little on the short side but with black tights and spanx it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for going out. Stretchy and light weight. Perfect for nights out
4.0,I love the case that  covers my whole phone. No separate screen to put  on.
4.0,"The buttons don‚Äôt actually button, they are just for decoration.  It runs somewhat small. I usually get XL but wish I would have gone a size bigger.<br />Nice looking dress otherwise"
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my sister's baby shower. It's a really cute bib, but it is too big for a newborn... it may fit a one year old."
4.0,"Soft, cute, easy."
4.0,"These charms are very cute for jewelry making. My only complaint is that there was only 2 dog paw outline charms, I wanted at least one more. I got so many compliments on the earrings I made with them."
4.0,A good product; I wish they have more products available and bigger sizes for reasonable price
4.0,A really nice pair of glasses. Fits perfectly. Not fit for wearing over your forehead is you like to raise your glasses off your eyes.
4.0,"Fits just perfect, not I haven‚Äôt used because it has not rained yet, but is excellent highly recommended"
4.0,My husband likes the length of these ties.
4.0,Just started wearing the cap. Nice!!!
4.0,"The dress is super light weight and for the most part comfortable. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô 11‚Äù 38DD bra and a 34 inch waist. I‚Äôve an overall petite plus size hour glass figure. The dress is long and there‚Äôs some issues with side coverage, but for summer it‚Äôll work"
4.0,"I really liked the shape of the lenses. I liked the visibility using them. just a little expensive, but much better quality than others I have asked for the same price."
4.0,"I love the way these look.  Very stylin swimsuit.  The downside is they lack elastic around the waist meaning they are kind of hard to get on. The waist fits my waist great, but getting it over my butt without elastic is a bit challenging.  Once on, though, they fit perfectly."
4.0,"I love this dress, it‚Äôs fun and bohemian and cool for hot humid summer days. Some might consider the pattern too bright/kitschy (def not work appropriate), but I love it. Does take a while to ship.<br />Perfect dress for beach/farmer‚Äôs market."
4.0,Looks to be well made. Has a firm brim.  Did come with a crease down middle from being folded in half.  Large fits my  adult head.  The bottom is gathered by elastic so it is snug.
4.0,"Though these glasses are marketed for men, they look great on me - woman.  They do a great job of blocking out harsh, glaring/blinding sunlight and they fit my narrow face well.  They seem to be well constructed.  My only complaint is that the nose pads have a small spot on them that tend to feel scratchy on my nose.  I will use some very fine grit sandpaper later on to try and smooth them down some, but other than that I think these are very good sunglasses."
4.0,"Was supposed to be rose gold, but isn't. It's the letter 'b' but you'll need an afternoon to be sure...Returning it."
4.0,Material was nice. It would have been great if it fit right. The sizing is off. I suggest getting it a size or two larger.
4.0,"I have been wearing this watch for a little over 2 years now and it is by far one of the best I have owned. Solid construction quality and sits comfortably no matter what activity you are doing, this watch is perfect for everyday wear!"
4.0,The purse was exactly as pictured and sized and the color was spot on (I got chocolate). The only reason it lost a star is because it smelled absolutely horrible when I opened it up.  I've had it for a week now and spray it with febreeze every day and I have multiple dryer sheets in it but the smell still isn't totally gone. My best guess is it's a result of the dye they used...or at least that's what I'm going to tell myself because I don't like any of the alternatives.
4.0,Not well made but it was cheap and worked fine for our son's costume where he needed a king crown
4.0,"Awesome shirt, the shoulder straps are a little fragile, but otherwise its awesome."
4.0,"I love these tongue rings! Shipping took a little while and I did get 2 doubles so I ended up with 18 different tongue rings, but overall I'm very happy with my order!"
4.0,Nice pj's. Very cute and my friend says comfortable. I bought these for a friends birthday and she really liked them.
4.0,fine. Hard to change modes and sometimes the timer goes off
4.0,"I took off one star due to flimsy post connection (easily bent). Otherwise, earrings are nice."
4.0,High quality and fine details.
4.0,Great price pretty piece.  My daughter loves all things rainbow and unicorn so its a perfect combo.  Was going to make something similar when I saw this so glad I did love the detailed flowers much cuter than I would have done it
4.0,"First I‚Äôd like to say that the picture is deceiving. The top is definitely more of an off white color. The neck where it comes to a v and ties is much shorter than the picture. It‚Äôs as though they‚Äôre selling the outlet ones here on Amazon that didn‚Äôt quite meet the cut of the full price. That being said for the price it‚Äôs a steal. There was nothing wrong with the top as some have stated, no rips, loose threads, etc... Just not the top in the picture. As far as the quality goes, I don‚Äôt know what some people expect for $15 but I think it‚Äôs a great buy. It‚Äôs similar enough to the picture. To create the look the model is wearing I would suggest going up a size or two. I have received many compliments with this blouse. The overall quality is good, at least mine was. I gave it four stars instead of five because of the deception but for $15 you can‚Äôt go wrong."
4.0,This products fabric is very shiny
4.0,The dress is ok. My only issue is it‚Äôs a little big. I would have preferred it a bit smaller.
4.0,The top is a too long for my taste. The bottoms are made to be worn at the belly button (which isn‚Äôt comfortable to me)  otherwise the crotch area is long. But overall they are comfy and warm.
4.0,"These have a good amount of stretch and are long enough so they stay in place over tummy and hips.  I ordered these to wear under sheer tops, and nothing worse than constantly tugging underneath to pull a cami down.  Nice quality.  Just received last week and only washed once, so I can't give it 5 stars because I don't know how long they will hold up.  But so far very please. Recommend."
4.0,These were a tight squeeze for me into the mediums. I typically wear a size 8 or 10 pant for reference. The fit is flattering but I will probably need to lose another 5 lbs to be comfortable in these.
4.0,Very cute for little girls my daughter loves it. I bought 2 because I think they are good to break Very easily
4.0,Clasp is weak and she kept losing it from falling off the wrist .
4.0,Looks good on baby and decent quality
4.0,Excellent compression and they look good. Just a little hard to get on.
4.0,"This is a beautiful watch and my wife loves it.  That being said, there is a flaw with the strap holders that slip.  This makes the strap flip around.  A call to Coach did not get anywhere as far as a solution is concerned."
4.0,"I ordered medium in size, i'm 115lbs and 5'2 1/2. I'm glad i got medium size since it runs small and get the feeling of wearing the oversized idea. The material is actually nice, its cozy and fuzzy. The only thing i dont like is the pocket, its really shallow. I can barely put my phone which is iphone se but overall it was a good buy."
4.0,Pretty. Long. Wouldn't wear it with bright lights  behind you. inside only or over a bathing suit.
4.0,"These are nice boots, but they are definitely smaller than normal sizes."
4.0,Fit well and held my hair in place. Pretty color.
4.0,Love the color but the fabric is a little scratchy. For larger bust it definitely needs two buttons instead of one. I had to use a safety pin below the button to keep in closed.
4.0,"Does everything one would expect a clip to function it does, except, it also includes a simple LED light, that is slightly blocked by the rings. Obviously a design flaw, but the clip itself serves it's main purpose..."
4.0,"The blue color is a blueish-gray.  No hint of green like the picture suggests.  It's a true hobo bag - which means it's mean to slouch.  It's soft too.  I like the style but if you want something with structure, there are other bags out there you might like better"
4.0,I read all the reviews of this shirt and decided to buy off the reviews because it was so cute.  To my surprise the shoulder area was very tight to the point of not looking right so I am returning two of these.  I never had a problem with the shoulders of shirts but this one I did and I didn't read any bad reviews about the shoulder area.  :(
4.0,"Loved it,but then the zipper went bad but i would buy it again."
4.0,Adorable design . A bit thin though
4.0,Good Apple Watch Band with butterfly hook and good quality for value.
4.0,"i like it, it works, the price is pretty good though i think 8-10 is better for this quality of item...<br />it's not my favorite (i have a lot of these....) so it loses a star but overall there is nothing wrong with it and i am happy i have it :)<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review ‚Äì For almost 10 years I‚Äôve relied on amazon reviews more than anything else when buying items online and my assessment of the item is based solely on my experience using it and desire to help others buy the products that work for them! [if you found this review helpful click below - happy shopping :) ]"
4.0,"I really like the quality of the product, but would have liked it to be a little wider to fit duplicate check style."
4.0,My wife loves it...i hope it keeps her warm wen we bak to england
4.0,"These are lovely, just like the picture.  In a perfect world they'd be a bit heavier (they don't always hang right) but for the price you can't beat this."
4.0,These are well made acrylic leg warmers. I was expecting them to be cotton hence the 4 stars. These fit well. I haven‚Äôt worn them much at this point so can‚Äôt comment on longevity.
4.0,Absolutely love all these chokers. You definitely get a bang for your buck there's no denying that cute and stylish
4.0,I like it but they're too long
4.0,fun top to pair with anything
4.0,We purchased two sets men‚Äôs & women‚Äôs gatsby  we were very pleasantly surprised the items were really good quality.  The sets were not expensive and the items were really nice and very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"They were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but other than that exactly as expected!"
4.0,"Skirt is beautiful, I‚Äôm a medium so that‚Äôs what I ordered and it seemed small.<br />So I returned it and sized up and it was perfect!"
4.0,"I loved these tiny hoop earrings when I saw them online. There were some hang ups when I got them. The earrings are quite cute. They're shaped well, match almost anything, and are a classical style. The stones are secure in the channels and the clasps were functioning just as they should. I, unfortunately, wasn't able to wear these as I had intended. I have thicker earlobes, and these were too petite to fit around my ears. Luckily I have a second piercing these fit in. Just be aware these run on the PETITE side of jewelry fittings."
4.0,The hat doesn't fit well at all.
4.0,This shoe is so cute my daughter wears it for different occaisions. It was just a bit too big for her but she loves it nonetheless.
4.0,"I just received these the other day... My only complaint so far is that I received two blacks & a green, not the blue that's pictured/described... The underwear themselves are comfortable, & seem to be well constructed (will update if that changes). I did deduct a star for not getting what I expected to receive.  I did order a second set of the &#34;black, blue, green&#34; & a set of &#34;black, red, gray&#34;... We'll see what colors show up when they arrive..."
4.0,The top looks very nice.  I don‚Äôt care for the trim around the arm holes but like someone else wrote I am going to trim the lace on the bottom of the arm hole.  I am sensitive to lace there so I think if I trim it and finish off the seam it will lay better.
4.0,"It was pretty tight. I bought a XXL which is my typical dress size but it was still too small, especially around the mid section."
4.0,I thought the color was off. It can be worn with black or brown leggings. I‚Äôm not crazy about the pockets because it flares
4.0,"The quality was good . The material was soft and the design was also good , the cloth is breathable its making easy to wear . The double layer makes it so much comfort and stop wind . I am happy with the product  but I feel thats it a more price than once available in the market as some brands are offering mittens as well along with the hat at less price"
4.0,"Love these, they are a smidgen small around the head for mine and bf heads but they do stretch after a while. The mask is also a thicker material.. Other then that love them so far"
4.0,A bit expensive -- but it is what it is.
4.0,Fabric is thin so you have to wear underwear that is the same color or it shows thru.  Vey comfortable.
4.0,"Ok so im a big and tall guy and wanted this for a costume top and went larger in size. Bad mistake. This is true to American sizes. It‚Äôs way too big for me, but that‚Äôs my error. It‚Äôs good material and it‚Äôs comfortable."
4.0,"Really like the pack , the shoulder strap closure set up is a bit odd but functional. It's my daily grab and go and holds a couple days needs as well as the basics."
4.0,"I bought this a year ago for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it and uses it daily during the winter to bring in wood from outside.  Unlike some of the other reviewers that have had theirs for multiple years, ours just broke after less than a year of use.  I ordered two more, so we have a spare because it's a great bag.  Just wish ours would have lasted longer."
4.0,It is a really cool shirt and my daughter loves it but it runs small and she won't be able to wear it for long. Buy larger than you need.
4.0,"material is very lite, definitely not for cold weather. Fits comfy. raised a few eyebrows on content, which was a good thing."
4.0,Ok Quality good for its price
4.0,"Sticks well but still have to adjust it during my workout, overall very happy with the head bands for working out."
4.0,"This is a lovely necklace.  A wee bit on the heavy side, but nicely made!  I get compliments on it!"
4.0,"The fit was a bit big, especially in the feet. If I unzip the footies, it fits good."
4.0,I tried to band on my head with Contour HD1080p. It's very comfortable. But i never tried to make a video record yet. I hope this headband mount works
4.0,"This package came in a timely manor for Christmas and the product was described perfectly! There was a can that contained the oyster, along with a tool to open the oyster. The pearl was right there! It's just hard to tell what color the pearl was. I bought this item because I thought it would be the perfect bridesmaid gift for my beach wedding!"
4.0,The watch is a very stylish watch with nice features. Everything you expect from a baby G. Rugged and durable. The only downfalls to the watch are the dark face which is a little to dark for indoor use. It's still readable inside but it's difficult to use the timer and set alarms and things. The only other issue is the setting of the time. You set the digital time but then have to set the analog clock separately.  It's kind of a pain but isn't something you would have to deal with a lot. So all and all its a lovely watch and has been a nice addition.
4.0,"When I first ordered this swimsuit cover from Wild Hazel, I thought it would be free flowing underneath with nothing restricting in the way.  However when I recieved it and put it on, I noticed that there's an extra stitching going downwards from armpit to hip. This makes me believe that if a larger woman were to put this on it would not fit at all.  This is a bit misleading as the photo and description don't mention nor make it clear about the extra stitching underneath. While it fits, it's not comfortable due to this restrictive stitching. Material appears adequate nothing high quality nor too flimsy,  just adequate.  Style is based on personal taste, it has bright tassels on an all white ensemble.  My aunt enjoys loud clothing so I thought this style would suit her but instead my mom ended up liking it more.  She is always on the beach anyways as a Florida resident so she got more use out of it.  She doesn't mind the restrictive stitching as she enjoys a tighter fit. I guess everyone is truly different in terms of likes and dislikes.  I like more free-flowing items where as my mom doesn't.  So my mom gives it 5 stars, I give it 4. We settled on 4 1/2 stars."
4.0,"Not all of them snap in securely, and I got double of several. However, there is still a great selection of styles and sizes. I wear different ones all the time!"
4.0,Nice size stone..but it isn't the color indicated.  The red came in an orange hue
4.0,pleased with product
4.0,"I love this cardigan even though it‚Äôs still a bit bigger than expected. I ordered a large and followed that up by the reviews, but a medium would have been more fitted and the loose look Is in the win anyways. Love it!"
4.0,I purchased this item sometime ago but decided not to wear until a week ago. I received do many compliments on this dress. Very comfortable. Quality material.
4.0,Just got the watch I bought it for my little sister and she loves it it's very nice looking
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute and I wear it often but the sizing was a tad off
4.0,the chest area is a little tight but I'm gonna wear a tube top
4.0,This jacket is beautiful.  The only reason I gave this 4 starts was due the the cut not as fitted as the photos.  The quality of the material and make of the jacket is on point.  I looks good on (just straight on me).  Very nice jacket.  Thank you.
4.0,Good price nice
4.0,"Fit well, work well and comfortable! Great price for the quality"
4.0,"The material feels great, I usually order a large, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 160lbs and I found it was really baggy and for some one that‚Äôs tall, it‚Äôs too long for my liking. It goes way past my butt. Maybe a medium would‚Äôve been better for me, but I‚Äôm afraid it would be too tight around my shoulders and arm. However I am going to keep it and hope it shrinks after several washes."
4.0,"well made clasp stays closed, sparkly yet small and light weight.  I love them."
4.0,Beautiful. Little big.
4.0,"I got this bracelet for my husband because he is a HUGE Game of Thrones fan and I thought he would love it. Well he did! He loves the dragon in the middle especially. We do agree that we wish there was a different kind of clasp on it. The hanging chain is very annoying and makes it so that he can't work with it on. I also don't like the fact that each band is separate. It seems like this would be an easy way to get broken. I do however really like that the color of blue used in this beautifully stands out from the black and silver. Overall I like the bracelet and more importantly, my husband loves it! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions stated in this review are mine alone and are fully based on my own personal experience while using this product."
4.0,"The cups in the top run a lil small....the bottom was perfect,....."
4.0,"I was hesitant to venture into the land of unreviewed product purchasing, but I took the chance. Glad I did! I know it kinda looks like the American flag patched together to make a dress, but it looks lovely in person! The only thing is, it is very long (for reference, I'm 5'7&#34;, ordered a small) and made of soft yet quite thin material, which doesn't really bother me. However, short ladies beware! Unless you want to alter the dress, you'll have a whole lot of extra material gathered on the floor. The hem of this dress is designed to be uneven and the sides are the longest parts of it, which looks so beautiful! The v-neck buttoned style makes up the front of the dress, not the back. I'm small chested (32a), so I have to either knot the shoulder straps or cut and resew them if I don't want the front to hang too low for my taste. I truly think it would look just lovely on a gal with even a slightly bigger chest, so no worries! I really do love and feel beautiful in this dress and can't wait to wear it somewhere. üòä"
4.0,"The first time I received this product, one of the zippers was broken.  I returned it and received a message from the company wanting to make it right, so I had them send another one.  I love the color, but realized it's a little small.  This is not an expensive purse and it feels like it.  I gave it a four because the product was ok, but the customer service was excellent!"
4.0,"Number one: this is more lovely in person than in the picture.  Number two:  the detail, the dark patina and the quality of the chain and screw feature  are extremely well done.  The con: the tiny hole in the vessel makes it very difficult to be certain if ashes actually went in.  I choose to believe they are!"
4.0,"Very warm and comfortable and waterproof but thick lining. It stands up to -30 F cold (so claimed), and made in China if you care. Ozero is a Chinese brand came to find out. I bought it for warmth and waterproof not touch screen but it‚Äôs difficult to use with touchscreens. I bought a large and my fingertips don‚Äôt reach ends of glove fingers. My hands aren‚Äôt big usually a medium. Though a medium would be too tight with the thickness of the lining so bought large. Has decent grip due to the texturing on palms and beneath fingers."
4.0,"The charm is very nice. However, the text was already faded."
4.0,"I like this a lot.  Nice colors.  Lots of room without being overly bulky.  Will handle a typical handbag's supplies plus the needed travel supplies (tickets, passport), small sweater, etc., without being heavy."
4.0,Had a darker mark on the part with the words because of the metal. Really cute though and a great price!
4.0,"Fit well, just as described, but I think it looks like a flower-girl dress, not very sophisticated, for a grown professional woman to wear. Cheap looking lace. Might be great for a teenager/pre-teen or for a wedding party."
4.0,"The bag itself is very nice and what I expected. However, there is a very nasty smell at the top of the bag around the the zip area.Seems to be inside the lining.<br /> I have had it airing in the sun and it still remains. It has quite a fishy smell which means until I get rid of the smell, I can't use it. It's that bad.<br />Any ideas?"
4.0,More for fashion that actually keeping the sun out of your eyes. They had the look I wanted though.
4.0,"So excited to get this dress in the mail and I was very pleased with it when I tried it on! It fits very well, though if you're larger chested it gaps a bit on the bust, and is very comfy. It definitely looks elegant on and is well worth the reasonable price tag!"
4.0,This is a really nice Santa hat but it runs a little small. I got the child size for my son who is 8 years old and it was a little tight on him. Other than that it‚Äôs good. The lights work and look great.
4.0,Me gusto que fue tal cual
4.0,"I expected dress to fit a little small, but it seemed to be a little baggy on the sides. Other than that I like it and got lots of compliments. Great if you like that sewed type of look"
4.0,great quality belt better than I thought
4.0,"GREAT COAT. The picture of the product shows it perfectly. Fits well (I ordered a medium and I wear a size 12). I get compliments whenever I wear it. Very pleased with the quality of the coat. Warm, stylish, with a zipper that works smoothly and snaps to cover the zipper. Very pleased with this purchase"
4.0,"This is a colorful and vivid high waist skirt that has a bit of a stretch. Unlike my previous reviews, however, I am unable to wear it as it is somewhat large on me, even if I got the small size. The waist measurement for small is 26 inches; surprisingly my mom who has 28-30 waist could wear this skirt. Take note though, that she has an Asian frame, meaning her hips are narrow and her bum is small. That said, I do want to be able to wear this skirt as it is of decent quality, and the colors are eye-catching.<br /><br />I will update this review with photos of my mom as soon as I find a suitable top to complete the outfit."
4.0,"Definitely helps to reduce snoring. Although it's very comfortable, he inevitably yanks it off in the middle of the night & hurls it across the room where it ends up on the lamp shade...LOL He'll get used to it... much more comfortable than a c-pap machine!"
4.0,sizing was quite a bit off... it was way longer than it should be for a 6 but she will grow into it eventually. The dress is beautifully made
4.0,These are okay. I didn't pay much for them and they aren't worth much. No problem. Not very thick but sometimes cute folded over.
4.0,Material and make is good for the price. Looks just like in the pucture. Only not giving it a 5 because the waist area could be a bit more tailored but that might be just my preference. Overall happy with this dress.
4.0,"One was different size, but rest were legit. Still happy really."
4.0,"The dress fit great...I did think the underneath material would have been grey, but it was tanish color.  It's still a great dress. I'm excited to wear it to a special occasion next month."
4.0,"Overall, it fits well. I just think it‚Äôs a bit small for me, specifically in the bust area and the and the upper arm area. I would need an 1X.  However, for most people would fit well.  The quality is excellent! The color pattern is classic. L"
4.0,"The pants are great they run BIG , they have an elastic waist and if ur backpacking in them remember your burning calories so they will not fit u perfect 2 hours into your backpacking"
4.0,Very nice design and material
4.0,Don't really like the bra clasp on the inside - it pinches to much.  But the front is very attractive and flattering.  I guess I just have to use a bra strap extender with it.
4.0,The bottom half is somwhat see thru.  But if you wear neutral colored undergarments it's ok.
4.0,Love the shape of these shades. Doesn't hurt my eyes and doesn't make me squint.
4.0,They just don‚Äôt fit my foot. It happens. Seem like great shoes otherwise.
4.0,Everything looks just like the photo but beware it is a little see through.
4.0,"I like how light this product is and how it maximizes space utilization by being almost a clean-cut box. The build is very thin though, so I don't expect it to last very long (not with how airline luggage is handled)."
4.0,"Runs large. The XS/US2 is too long and boxy on me (5'2&#34; 103, Junior S usually). However, I can tell it's a good quality shirt and the design is interesting. The fabric is on the thicker side - good for spring and fall. I just wish it fit me. Photo was taken to give you an idea what the shirt looks like."
4.0,"Fast shipping, arrived a day before the earliest predicted Amazon delivery date. Skirt and waistband material appear to be good quality and garment is well-made. Definitely think it would have held up through practice runs and the performance of my competition piece. Unfortunately, it was too small. I am 5'4&#34;, weigh 125#, usually wear a medium/size 6 and have an athletic build but a softer belly. I ordered the size medium/large and it was tight enough to dig into my belly/sides and look unflattering. Would recommend ordering AT LEAST a size up, maybe two, unless belly fat is not an issue for you."
4.0,These shoes are great for a wide foot....which I have.  The upper strap material is very thin and stiff which effects the over-all comfort and 'walkability' of the shoe.  Not a bad shoe for the price but not the comfort level of my higher heeled Candies.
4.0,"Cute and not too &quot;cheap&quot; looking. A little thicker of a metal, It was delivered faster than I thought too thanks!"
4.0,Had it embroidered for a teenager. He loved it.
4.0,"This bangle looks good on my wrist and is good for everyday use, either day or out for the evening.  Very Classy!"
4.0,Good quality but a little small for men
4.0,"very colorful and attracts attention, would like it to be a little more stable. Top keeps collapsing."
4.0,"I ordered this Clastyle Men‚Äôs watch for myself and I do like the silver color of the band, the black color of the dial, the design and the styling of this analog wrist watch with the quartz movement, the three sub- dial set with the calendar window, and the scratch resistant curved mirror.<br />I do like that the watch fits my wrist perfectly, and I like that it is comfortable to wear, and easy to put on and take off as needed. I do like that I have been wearing it daily for the last several days and it does keep time accurately; so far, so good. One of the favorite features are the band width, the case thickness, length and diameter, and the pearl shell surface of the stainless steel strap.<br />I do like that this watch is lightweight and I like that the strap is gentle on my skin. I do like that the wrist watch appears to be made with quality materials and it seems to be durable, sturdy, and well designed. Considering the quality and the price point, it appears to be good value for bucks. I would recommend it."
4.0,"These are really nice plugs but they run small. I've had gauges for 6 years, been at a 9/16 for two years.The plugs I ordered were a size 9/16 but when I received them I thought they felt a little loose. Upon further inspection I saw that they were slightly smaller than all the other plugs that I own. I should have ordered up a size. Maybe I have really stretchy ears, or maybe i just like my plugs tight. Who knows...."
4.0,"I like the bag, very light and lots of pockets. The only thing I do not like is the handle is short for making it like a shoulder bag not using the crossbody handle. It is also not waterproof but for the price is good and can't complain."
4.0,"Good quality fit glasses well,arrived fast"
4.0,"I love the shirt, the material is nice and soft. the colors are sharp.  one thing. it is almost cut like a maternity shirt.  so order maybe a size smaller than usual. I purchased and XL I think a LG would have fit just fine."
4.0,"really beautiful bracelet, but very very tight. had to be very careful both taking it off and putting it on, and unfortunately it ended up bursting on me. i have all the beads so i can just restring them but still a bit bummed since i‚Äôd only gotten them maybe a month ago"
4.0,Really like these. One of the pair did not have good stitching. And I wish there were bigger sizes. However they do stay in place and have long legs which was exactly what I needed.
4.0,"I have plenty of back pairs in different styles this time I bought the royal blue and I love the color i usually buy small but this time I bought the extra small I'm pretty thick 5'3 (148lbs) and have nicely toned legs and slim at the waist got a little something in the trunk lol. But they fit just as expected, can't go wrong with 90 degree pants I love them and are my fav."
4.0,Pretty but have to watch that it does not fall off.
4.0,Nice stretchy material. Color is a rich Navy.
4.0,Small but cute. Allergy free and lightweight
4.0,I don‚Äôt give out 5 stars. Nothing is perfect in life. But these lanyards are pretty cool and my daughters use daily for their mask while back to school during covid (they attend full days). I think a good length for a 10-13 year old.
4.0,"I'm 5'-8"" 135-140 lbs 36D, and I ordered the med in four different colors, retuned all. They were very large and baggy on me. The neckline is loose and the fabric is on the thin side. The colors and style were otherwise great and will try again and order all in a small."
4.0,I really liked the bag and feel like it is good quality but it was much smaller than I expected. I am returning it because it will not fit my needs. I have decided to order anothe bag from this company that has a similar look but is larger.
4.0,"nice mask, but a tiny unimportant piece at the top came broken off and it arrived a bit bent. Easy to bend back into shape and serves its purpose well."
4.0,The Roman numeral for 4 is incorrect
4.0,"These are great shorts, but they are very big and baggy. I should have ordered a size smaller. While the waist fits fine, the legs are slightly frumpy."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter. Great fit, she loves them. Really nice material. One pair is tearing at seam but I think it‚Äôs normal wear and tear. Will definitely buy again"
4.0,"Comfortable and so far no issues with the graphic peeling off in the dryer, which I've seen happen with cheap shirts"
4.0,great bit of color for the fall wardrobe.
4.0,"very great quality, but it was way too small for me!<br />I have a YouTube channel & would love to review this item if you would like to send me another!<br />Business Inquiries: neonkristin212@gmail.com"
4.0,"Material feels amazing on my package. My one complaint is it seems a little small in the back. They are kinda cheeky. Maybe they were meant to be cheeky but it's not comfortable feeling like I have a wedgie all the time. We'll see how they fare after they go through the wash. If they are reliable, I would probably order them again a size up."
4.0,"First of all, 5'0"", 108 lbs, 34A, and I ordered a 4-6 in White Floral in Yellow.  The waist, neckline, and armholes all fit perfectly.  The bust is a little loose, but it still looks fine.  It's definitely longer on me than I would normally prefer.  The length looks ok with heels, but with flats I look a little stumpy in this one.  I'll probably end up having this hemmed.  Overall, though, it's extremely flattering and comfortable, and I totally love it.<br /><br />What really shocked me about the dress is how sheer the material is.  The dress has such a structured look that I pictured something a little stiffer.  The dress is basically one layer of what is practically chiffon.  It's definitely going to keep me cool in the summer, but the skirt is so sheer that the only thing I can wear underneath on the bottom half is a nude g-string.  Everything else shows right through.  I'm sure I'll order more of this dress in a different pattern, but I'll definitely choose a darker color that is less likely to be so see-through. So just bear that in mind, unless you're fine with wearing a slip underneath."
4.0,"It is a little short, but I am planning on adding black lace anyway.  Thanks."
4.0,"The helmet was a little small by about 1"" in diameter and maybe an 1"" deep. But it is a beautiful helmet, well constructed and the face does open upward and close good. Well worth the money (when it fits).  ;)"
4.0,"When you first open the box, you find a felt-lined, sturdy case. The frames are a good quality and the lenses are clear. When you hold them up to the sky, you see a slight yellow tint, which probably provides the blue light blocking function.<br /><br />Also included is a ""blue ray generator,"" which seems generate an ultraviolet light. The card has a white section that momentarily turns blue when you shine the blue light on it. Don't quite understand how this helps with the use of the glasses.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good quality item, and I'm only giving it 4 stars since this is a gift, and I won't be able to judge what it's like to wear these for a prolonged period. I might update this review as I receive feedback."
4.0,The 4X Fits like a true 16 in womans. It sucks in the belly and holds the girls in place. I took off 1 star because the material is a bit thin around the neckline.
4.0,"I really liked the outfit I had to send back it was just a little to small, great material I will order another size up didn't want to much of my back out"
4.0,"I ordered a larger size based on reviews. However the suit kept riding up around my neck because it was too large. I would‚Äôve rated it a higher rating because it was comfortable (outside of the pool) and easy to use. However I ended up giving it to a larger friend because the top riding up and binding my neck for swimming because it just did not fit me. For reference, I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 119. Broad shoulders. normally wear a medium"
4.0,"Good material, very cute-fit a little large, however both outfits we received actually have the feet/booties instead of stopping at the ankles (which is what we were looking for and why we purchased them)"
4.0,"Ok...<br />So I bought the clear jellies from both Amazon (pictured on the left), and Nordstrom (pictured on the right) because I wanted to find the best one. I had been wanting jellies forever, so this was a shoe adventure I was willing to put some extra thought and time into. Here‚Äôs my comparison between the two jellies, and what I ended up choosing!<br /><br />First, the Amazon jelly sandals.<br /><br />Pros:<br />‚Ä¢ $10 cheaper!<br />‚Ä¢ They have less of a blue tint (all clear jellies seem to have this blue-ish hue problem, but these seem to have it the least!)<br />‚Ä¢ They fit better in every way, and have a more flattering (in my opinion) shape!<br /><br />Cons:<br />‚Ä¢ They squeak a lot when you walk, and it almost sounds like fart sounds, lol. (I fixed the problem by rubbing the inside down with a dryer sheet. Thanks, Google!)<br />‚Ä¢ The buckles seem a bit rusty, making me wonder how long these sandals will last.<br />‚Ä¢ I didn‚Äôt notice until my husband came home and pointed it out, but these sandals smell REALLY strongly of yucky chemicals. We had to put them outside - hoping that fixes the problem!<br /><br />Now, for the Nordstrom jelly sandal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />‚Ä¢ You can tell immediately these are better quality. The buckles have no rust, and look perfectly shiny and clean! Also, these shoes actually have a sole (so no squeakiness when you walk), and it‚Äôs more comfortable because of the little extra padding.<br /><br />Cons:<br />‚Ä¢ $10 more expensive.<br />‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs slightly more ‚Äúblue toned‚Äù than the Amazon sandal (but only slightly. You‚Äôll only notice it if you care, like me.) :)<br />‚Ä¢ The straps don‚Äôt fit as nicely as the ones on the Amazon sandal. (I have ridiculously small ankles though, so there‚Äôs that...)<br /><br />My final decision:<br /><br />It was such a hard decision, because both have their wins. I love the shape of the Amazon jellies so much more, and the fact that they are clear all the way around (even the bottom). And I love the refreshing ‚Äúahh, this is the good stuff‚Äù look and feel of the Nordstrom jellies!<br /><br />In the end, I conclude that the Amazon jellies are more casual - perfect for the beach, doing errands, etc. and the Nordstrom jellies are a little bit more ‚Äúfancy‚Äù, perfect for slightly dressier situations.<br />Therefore, I kept both! I have never spent so much money on simple jellies, but because I‚Äôm going to wear them a lot and I don‚Äôt buy a ton of shoes, I feel a little less guilty about it. :)<br /><br />Hope my ‚Äújellies research adventure‚Äù helps some of you other jellie-loving gals!"
4.0,I gave this 4 out of 5 it is rather tight. It will work great to sleep in. Was hoping to wear it out. I really like the pattern.
4.0,"This is a such a beautiful and stylish belt! I absolutely love the look of the snake print with black, the quality and how it would look with my black jumpsuit or dress. HOWEVER, it runs too small. I'm so disappointed that I had to return the belt. The M/L is more like a small medium. The description states that it is ""elastic"" but there's no elasticity at all."
4.0,Very comfortable with great stretch.  Looks a lot like silk and is made of very light weight fabrics.  I expect they will last for more than a single season.
4.0,"The earrings are very beautiful and seem to be great quality, but the cuffs on the upper part of the earring do not stay put very well on your ear, so I would be prepared to secure the upper part of the earring to your ear with adhesive when wearing."
4.0,"I bought these for my sons in California and they really liked the way they looked and they liked the fit even better.  Highly recommend these jeans and of course, with Amazon, a very quick delivery!"
4.0,Like the color. The snap to fasten it didn't work.
4.0,"At first, I was put off by the narrowness of the glass, and almost sent them back, but now, I actually like them."
4.0,"This is a nice jacket and a great value. However, I would order a size down for a kiddo. We had to return and get a smaller jacket because the first was way too big."
4.0,Have been wearing this bracelet for several weeks and am less fatigued..
4.0,"I was happy to find winter style socks that didn't have any wool in them. Unfortunately, once they went through the wash and dry on medium/high heat I found them to be a bit too tight on top in the lower calf area. I'd say it would fit fine if you have a smaller foot/leg, say a woman's 7 or smaller? I don't have large calves and wear 8.5-9 shoes, but I don't baby my laundry so these were just a little too tight to be comfortable. Cute, though!"
4.0,"The Dana Basics No Show Non-Skid Socks are nice but they run small.  The socks say they fit size 5-9 but I am a size 9 and could not wear them comfortably but I gave them to my niece who is a size 5 and they fit her much better.  The socks are nice with a lace toe cover. She likes wearing them around the house but with the non-slip grip on the bottom, they are not comfortable in shoes.<br /><br />We washed and dried one pair and they did shrink quite a bit. They do stretch back out but are a little tight now.  We only machine washed the other pairs and let them air dry and they did not shrink up as much.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER ‚Äì I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and review. No compensation as received for this review."
4.0,"Cute outfit. A bit tight around the waist, but overall like my purchase."
4.0,"I bought a 8-10 and the top is way to snug, the bottoms fit but are very long for my 5‚Äô2‚Äù. They are super soft and very pretty. I wish they had a petite."
4.0,the strings are not togetehr with edge of racquet.
4.0,overall are cute and have good pocket size. I like how they look from the back. They aren‚Äôt form hugging and are loose like the name suggests. I could pull them up higher but don‚Äôt want my butt to show so I wish they were a bit longer. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô8 and was 150 at the time.
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous. I'm giving it 4 stars though because it was not light green, more like teal."
4.0,These look way better than I thought they would considering the price.
4.0,"My wife ordered them as casual or lounge pants. They look very good on her. She says they are somewhat complex to put on, but they are comfortable."
4.0,"the neckline was too low for me but other than that, I liked the fabric weight and print"
4.0,"Bought this for my husband to use while traveling for our honeymoon and at first account, he thought it was too big and cumbersome, but after using it during out honeymoon, he loves it and doesn't want to go back to his old wallet!"
4.0,"Amazon is so on top of this.  within a couple days of the review I wrote below, the picture was changed from showing 3 lights in 3 blister packs to one light/blisterpack as you probably see above.  makes my review look somewhat confused and irrelevant.<br /><br />only had this 1 day but wanted to write the first review to warn you nice folks if you thought, as I did, that you would get three different color light devices as in the picture [that used to be with the description].  Within the SINGLE collar-light device there are indeed 3 different-colored LEDs.  But your order will only have ONE device in one blister pack.  Mine was red.<br />works pretty well so far.  don't know how soon it will pop off the dog collar and be lost.  The outer casing is probably the same as Flash & Glow sold by Spunky Pup so those reviews may be helpful"
4.0,I bought a size up to wear with leggings. I wish it was longer and the arm hole were not quite so big. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I love this shirt. Not to tight, not to loose. Fits great, looked great! You can button all the way up and control how much skin you wanna show. I‚Äôm gonna get one in black! Perfect for fall!"
4.0,And bigger than I expected.
4.0,Super cute but funny enough‚Ä¶.they are way too soft that actually slippery when walking and sweaty while relaxing
4.0,"Nice material, protective and fit well!"
4.0,Really nice looks good on fit as expected. Would have given 5 stars but had to air it out had funny smell.
4.0,"These are super cute and go up to just about under the knee on me (I'm 5'3) if starting around the ankle. But I mainly wanted to write this review, because when I purchased the item I thought I was getting socks, not leg warmers. I will still keep them, and I do like them, they serve the almost the same purpose."
4.0,Great dress for the money but came with multiple loose beads that had to be resewn.
4.0,I love it but to big.
4.0,I like the different colors
4.0,"I have been using a similar belt like this from a different brand, but I wanted a second one so I could rotate between the two or use when one needs washing.  This one is pretty good.  It is a little smaller width wide, so it does not cover as much as the other one.  However; it works for what I need and really helps get a good sweat during my workouts.<br /><br />I have not washed this yet, but I wash my other one in a mesh bag and will do the same with this one.  I will not dry it.  If I have any issues with coming apart once I do, I will update my review."
4.0,"I normally wear a medium, and I ordered an extra large based on what I read in the reviews.  It is definitely large on me.  The large should have been fine, and I'm guessing the medium would have been fine, too.  It's a light t-shirt material and has a nice flow to it."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 168 and I got a size large. The jeans does stretch but not as much as i prefer. Xl would have been perfect with extra room. I do have a little belly and the jeans are high rise enough to hold it in. I order the blue color which is a nice denim look. The roses doesn‚Äôt look cheaply made. I found a crop shirt with the same rose embroidery..it looks so cute together!!!! Overall worth the buy
4.0,"The fabric looks somewhat cheaper than it looks in the picture. I wouldn't have paid $50 for the quality but overall, it's not too bad. The size perfectly fits; colors exactly matches with that in picture."
4.0,"I ordered from 3 different sellers, who all had the exact same listing photo. Starting from the left Merokeety, Fekoafe, Anftfh. The color of Merokeety was the most accurate. The material of all three are 100% cotton and not flowy like the photos but very stiff. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to keep any of them but if I was it would be Merokeety because the color is the best in my opinion."
4.0,"I was hoping the apricot was more of an off-white color. It is a pale yellow and not sure it looks good on me. Otherwise, the sweater is fairly heavyweight and appropriate for cool days. It is boxy in fit which works if you don't like something clingy. If you are thin/fit, you might feel it is not flattering. I have not washed it, so not sure if it will soften up after washing/drying."
4.0,"They are perfect, like them a lot."
4.0,Decent quality tassel earrings. They are very long though. I have pictures but for some reason I haven't been able to add pictures to my Amazon reviews for a while now? I got these earrings to wear on Valentines Day and they are perfect for that. I will be cutting the tassels shorter though.
4.0,"I would like down, but that could be preference. It's a cute top though!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, have already held up to several washes, the pants are a bit oddly long though. More Capri length than shorts, but my kid doesn‚Äôt seem to mind."
4.0,"The brouch is absolutely beautiful and while the photo looks like a deep pink it's a true rich red. It was a perfect match to my dress and l received several compliments with one lady who said she couldn't take her eyes off of it my entire presentation.  Definitely it is a class act. It would get a full 5 stars except after ONE wear, the clasp broke. It's the only cheap part of this item. Otherwise it's a true winner."
4.0,"The glasses seem to be good quality, especially for the price. My issue is that they are really big on my face. I have a narrow, ovular face and these were advertised as being on the smaller side. No bueno for me, but super chic regardless. The reason I‚Äôm giving a 4 star review is that they slide down my nose constantly, which is exhausting. I‚Äôve dropped them before because of this."
4.0,"The front is really cute, it has a nice trim in off-white and the cut is comfy.  The material is not very fuzzy or warm but this sweater kept shape washing and didn't fade or shrink.  I don't love the fringe in the back.  It adds bulk that's not needed.  It also feels weird to lean back in a chair on and it pokes out and down very stiffly, almost giving you a tail.  I wish I looked as cute in this sweater as the model but it doesn't really look as great as the photo."
4.0,I have used these for years.  I love them.  They last about a year unless you are really hard on things.  I have them for my reading and sun glasses.  The rubber that holds them to your glasses are great unless you have very thin wire frames.
4.0,The gown is soft and comfortable.
4.0,Very nice piece of jewelry for the price.  It's very light weight and has a nice chain
4.0,"Great dress.  Great color (blue with white trim). Fabulous price!  My critiques: the heart-shaped buttons are a little hard to maneuver, and the cap sleeves are a little puffy."
4.0,"The watch is great looking, much more expensive looking than it is.  Delivery was somewhat slow but no problems."
4.0,The chain is very pretty and shiny and solid. What I dislike about the chain is the lobster claw is too tiny. Bc of that I do not recommend .
4.0,"I loved this shirt, it's unique. The sleeve wasn't as puffy as on the picture and the belt was a little short, however, it's still cute."
4.0,"Cute top, have gotten complements on it."
4.0,This was for my 14 yr old daughter. She loves it. Have to adjust the straps so the back doesn't dip so low. But it is a very cute dress.
4.0,GF loves it !
4.0,Good quality and nice print
4.0,Great shirt for my 9 year old boy. he's a bit smaller for his age but I think t-shirts should fit a little bigger so I think it's perfect. It washes well but can get wrinkly if not taken out of the dryer right away.
4.0,"This is a very nice dress.  The fabric is really nice,lightweight and feels soft on your skin.  . The  vibrant black color was maintained even after washing it and was still relatively wrinkle free.  The material is very easy to maintain.<br /><br />I took it out of town for a nice dinner with the in-laws.  The dress traveled very well and didn't have many wrinkles.  It was very sliming, which was very appealing.  And it was very comfortable even in the hot Texas heat.  I like the lace with the built in bodice.  The zipper in the back was a bit strange as it did not go all the way to the top.  Instead it stopped at the bottom of the collar.  It would be slightly easier to put on if the zipper went all the way to the top of the collar.  I would be very interested in seeing this dress with all lace in the front instead of buttons.<br /><br />This dress could be worn for various occasions, such as an anniversary, dinner at a nice restaurant, or even to church.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,Not a bad dress.  Nice and simple.  I like that
4.0,"The purse is so dang cute, people think it's a high end purse hahaaha. It's great for winter, you obviously can't have a pink flowery purse in winter, and vise versa. The inside is a bit cramped, and the opening is small, but if your wallet isn't gigantic like mine you're fine."
4.0,Love the color blue. My easy last minute slip on dress. Very comfortable. I always wear a short light sweater when I‚Äôm cold inside from the air. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2. Length is perfect
4.0,Some sharp edges on the watch but otherwise I'm happy with the watch. I would probably buy a Pagani Design again.
4.0,"Its a red sash, goes around my 50 inch waist once with plenty of slack, a thinner person could wrap it twice or so like they used to. It hasn't broken, is still red, and has yet to catch fire at random. I recomend it. For heavy people like me get 2 and some thread for a proper waist sash."
4.0,"I've had these very affordable glasses 3 months now and they are holding up great, look good and haven't been scratched to bad. However they don't really help with brightness like other more expensive glasses but for the price it's great deal"
4.0,So far so good. Have to wait till my child goes to school. Seems to fit great
4.0,Love the beads rhe leather straps could be a little better quality but very sturdy!
4.0,Time to put them away but they did last all winter and are really sporty.
4.0,I really liked the hat bit it was much top big on my head.I gave it to my bestfriend he absolutely loved it.Hes a marine stationed down south and he gets a ton of compliments. A few of his buddies have even tried to swipe it from him haha
4.0,Nice fit. good quality material too. fit as expected.
4.0,These are super cute - but they are a TOTALLY different color than pictured; check out buyer photos before purchasing any color of these jellies for their true color.
4.0,"I got this for my friend as a Christmas present last year, and it was great! He loved it. After a while, though, it started to get these fabric beads. Other than that, it was a good product and its a win for any ATL United fans."
4.0,Amazing product! High quality leather! I just wish it's vizor had leather on the bottom side
4.0,It's very very well made and you can slam your opponent and it will not rip that's what i like  just i don't like i was heating up to faast in it  but  that's ok  long as it last
4.0,They work. I purchased these to put in my ball bag while umpiring as we can wear watches or have phones on the field. With the material it may stand up to some light shots from foul balls behind the plate.
4.0,"Vibrant color, good quality"
4.0,"Well worth the price!  It was so low, I only ordered 1 to see the quality of the belt.  I intend to order more after seeing and using the belt."
4.0,Vibrant and functional
4.0,"I‚Äôm a tall girl so that probably impacted the fit of this top. It was a very cute top and I actually first saw this on a boutique website for a higher price point. When it arrived I loved the color and style but sadly just too tight around the waist to look good on me. It was almost too short, too. But again, I‚Äôm tall so most will likely not have that problem. Sad it didn‚Äôt fit me well because it‚Äôs honestly really cute and a nice top for the price."
4.0,it holds pant
4.0,Fit is a little large. The neck is long and it probably won't line up quite as pictured. It is also really more of a long sleeve instead of a sweatshirt if you can't tell by the picture.
4.0,"I really do like the costume. I lucked out and it fit me almost perfectly. If you're on the heavier side, I definitely would not suggest it, but great fitting for someone medium/athletic build. The fit in some places like the crotch is a little snug so expect some bulge and the behind look of wearing tight leggings. Wearing other clothing underneath is not an option for this costume or it won't fit well. The zipper was my biggest complaint about it. I had to have someone else zip me back up after using the restroom because of the position directly up the back. Other than that, it's a sweet costume and you'll definitely get compliments on it. Go get it!"
4.0,Love the color and style. A little too wide but I really like them. Chemical smell but not too overwhelming. Stylish and unique. I gave 4 stars because of the width and smell. Otherwise this would definitely be a 5 star.
4.0,"love the look, but does run small.  thanks to reviews I bought the right size for sister - 5X fits her 2-3X frame.  nice poly satin fabric, but no stretch.  for once top and bottoms are proportionate, she has trouble with bottoms of a set being way to big.  wish the front facing were sewn down, hope it doesn't curl and make a mess of itself in the wash.  wrinkles aren't much of a concern anymore, - we have learned that hanging to dry on outdoor clothesline overnight works wonders to get rid of wrinkles on most any garment!"
4.0,"my granddaughter loved the ring, it just seems to run a little big. It was a size 10"
4.0,"This Sookoo key chain has a masculine look and would make a nice gift. It comes in a nice box for presentation and has an elegant look to it. The keyring is sturdy but not overly heavy--it will not add excess weight to my car‚Äôs ignition swtich, not will it weigh too much when it is in a pocket or hanging from a belt loop. The auxiliary hook is a matte/brushed metal, and the key ring is a highly polished dark metal. The auxiliary hook opens easily with my thumb, and it would clamp securely onto any belt loop or a second set of keys. Alternately, it could be used to hand the entire key set from a hook on a key rack. My husband likes this so he can easily separate his work keys from his home keys. This is a nice way to add some fashion to an otherwise plain keychain.<br /><br />I received this key chain for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review."
4.0,"I got this in the lilac color and it's very nice. It's really oversized, but in my opinion that's apparent from looking at the pictures so I went with my normal size. For me it's something I'll wear around the house on lazy days. I would say size down one to two sizes if you're looking for a more regular fit or for something that looks good to wear out. The material is very soft and I'm loving the lilac color for summer. I've worn and washed it a few times and the material has held up well with the slightest bit of shrinkage.<br /><br />Personally I'll probably order again in a smaller size in a few colors so it looks a little more presentable to wear out of the house, because the material is so lightweight and comfortable without being see-through I can just envision wearing this all summer.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I have worn this dress to a casual dinner, to church and to work, so it's VERY versatile! I also love the length - no too short, not too long. I am 5'6"" and a size 14 and it falls just below the knees on me (I ordered the large). I like the print, too. The ONLY thing I don't like is the elastic waist is a little too high on me. I would like it better if it fell a little lower, around my natural waist, instead of just under my chest. I usually throw on a thick elastic belt over it so it's not so noticeable. All in all, though, I would recommend this dress when it goes on sale!"
4.0,"Love this watch and get tons of compliments on it.  Well designed and good quality.  Quiet, good fit.  Takes a few wears to get the band to loosen up a bit, but once that happens, it's great."
4.0,"big (wide) on my tall skinny child, but long enough.  nice and soft and warm though!"
4.0,"First, it is not as long as it appears in the picture. Also, while the fabric is plenty wide, it is relatively thin. So in order to get a full appearance, you'll have the fold the width either in half or about a third over itself.<br /><br />It breathes because it is not woven particularly thick. Fabric is cheap obviously, but it's not really itchy or uncomfortable (although I guess if you have super sensitive skin, it might be too rough for you). It catches well on other fabrics, which gives it some grip/staying power. Not very warm because it is a dsiplay piece obviously. The ends of the fabric are loose and prone to coming undone/splitting, so it won't take many wears for the ends of the scarf to fall apart. Kind of works with the vibe of it though<br /><br />Over all, I just wish it was maybe a foot or two longer in length"
4.0,So far it‚Äôs great. No turning colors
4.0,"These were good, nice color, no odor"
4.0,Only problem was gray one. Word just embossed and not colored to stand out
4.0,Selling to someone
4.0,"I ordered a size L and I'm 6'1, 185 lbs. The compression isn't exactly tight. Follow the sizing instructions! Kind of wish I had gotten a medium, but I've been in L's for years. Very stylish and comfortable. I wanted something to keep my thighs from chafing and these get the job done. Kind of wish there was also a pouch for my junk though."
4.0,This is a great looking watch for the money. Heavy & seems to be very sturdy. The only blurp I would say this watch has is the digital light is not bright like it is in the picture. So it's still hard to tell what time it is. That was the main reason I purchased this watch. All in all still a very nice watch. I'd purchase this brand again. I'll just be mindful of the extra options they offer on the next watch...
4.0,Very flattering. Suit is very cute. Tie back top makes it more adjustable than most tankinis.
4.0,I wanted to buy these to simulate the big glasses filter on snapchat and I looked through the reviews to see what size I should get. Everyone recommended I got a small so I did. The small size was not the size I wanted but the build of the glasses were very stable. I will be getting a large pair soon from this seller.
4.0,What I like about the necklace was how different it was made.  What I don't like is there aren't any earrings to go with this beautiful necklace.
4.0,"These are nice shorts to work out in, but unfortunately were to small. They really are like the PT shorts from basically training."
4.0,"This cycling shirt has lots of cooling and it has the pockets in the back for your supplies and water. The material is self wicking and keeps moisture away. The only thing I am not impressed with, is that the stripes at the zipper, do not line up like they should."
4.0,This is a great watch but the strap is a little small for anyone who is above averge wrist size.
4.0,Great price and pretty dress.
4.0,Love this brand.  I have a couple different styles already.  Very true to size. Only complaint is I wish there were belt loops  The drawstring does loosen as you wear them.
4.0,"Material is soft, but stiff if that makes sense. I wanted something more loungey, but is cute with jeans"
4.0,"I purchased this dress to attend a conference where I need this color.  My size is 5'5&#34; @ 125 lbs.  I ordered a small.  I will order again but, I will get the medium.  Perfect length stopping just above my knee.  Stretchy material.  Keeping this size as I can still breath in it as the material stretches. Zipper is in the back.  My belly fat is hidden in this dress. I like it."
4.0,I ordered a size bigger because things usually run small. But this is one time sized are exactly as supost to be.<br />Beautiful and very comfortable.  Do recommend
4.0,These were very cute and fit perfect. Slower shipping but it was ok.
4.0,Nice and form fitting!
4.0,"I'm not saying I hate these leggings,  but they just didn't fit my lifestyle.  I have cats and dogs that shed, and once I washed these,  they ecame a magnet for hair.<br /><br />They fit great, we're a great length and we're very comfortable.  I would recommend to a pet free wearer."
4.0,I love the style and colors but the cotton yarn is a bit rough. I will probably wear them a lot more in the summer.
4.0,"Super cute oversized sweater! It‚Äôs supposed to be a little big/loose and it worked out perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and got a medium. The material is a little scratchy at first, but after the first wash it was much better!"
4.0,This sweater is soft. However it is rather thin. I would expect more from Loomis products. Fruit of the Loom has better quality sweatshirts. I do love the colors though. I have worn it once and have yet to wash it.
4.0,nice fit and not to heavy with the body armor
4.0,"Note: Sample provided for review.<br /><br />I got the blue striped shirt. It's very nice. Dressy. I didn't try it with a tie because it came on the small size. I ordered the XL thinking it would be OK. It should have been but it was too tight under the arms, around the waist and chest, and around the neck. Way too tight around the neck. Not even close. Sleeves and hem were perfect length. I'm generally an XL. My neck is 17-1/2&#34;, height 5'10&#34;, weight 180 pounds.<br /><br />If you're interested in the shirt and you're not a &#34;European&#34; cut with narrow shoulders and waist and smallish upper arms, I would order a size larger than what it says here. I have no idea what the larger size will mean in sleeve length. Anyway, it's a very, very nice shirt. quality material and construction."
4.0,"Love the look, but was a little more cheaply made than expected."
4.0,Nice quality & I like the color combo.
4.0,First off these are nice shorts.... but.<br />the xl feels like a large medium<br />the pocket opening is too small for man hands<br />they fit more like a boys large rather than a mens large<br />the material is exactly like swimming trunks with no liner.<br />if you want these ignore ALL reviews unless you like tight shorts that ride in several places. now when i wash these they will shrink a little to the point i can not wear them.
4.0,"I got these to wear to protect my arms against the sun while at Disney. I have colorful tattoos on both arms and I wanted something to throw on while in the sun all day. These did a fantastic job, excellent price that came in two and my arms breath and was not hot! I would definitely recommend! When I looked at the same product and pricing for them in other store...WTF! Buys these instead!"
4.0,fit is big - will fit my daughter in about 5 years (!)
4.0,There exactly what I needed.
4.0,"A bit looser than I expected but still comfortable enough and better than being to tight, as I have a high arch."
4.0,The sleeves were super tight so I slit them. I have big arms. It‚Äôs thin but most of these dresses on Amazon are. For the price it was worth it.
4.0,The watch is great as described the strap is a little loose and can easily come off.  Amazing comments watch works and the seller was good
4.0,I really like the palazzos. They fit so nicely and get compliments when I wear them.
4.0,Replacement lenses
4.0,I really enjoyed this necklace until the latch came off
4.0,It was cute I just got scratched up really fast every time I dropped it and then eventually the tassel started to Bend and look ugly but other than that it was OK
4.0,"I pair of the socks quickly got holes in them, but the others are still in use and great."
4.0,So comfy and cute.  But not red.  Not red at all
4.0,Only problem is you have to hand-wash.
4.0,Fits great. I sweat easily and wearing this under my shirts or button downs definitely helps keep me cool. Great buy and product.
4.0,"Absolutely adorable! the only thing I didn't like is that the description doesn't mention that this is CHROTCHLESS, I would've at least liked to know that before purchasing. Besides that, I really like it."
4.0,"the gloves are great, except i thought they would be warmer. I purchased these for my wife to keep her hands warm on our shooting trips to the mountains, and they just didnt cut it. The seller never once stated that they were warm, i had just assumed they would be. Over all they are good gloves just now that they are not warm"
4.0,They're really cute but very stiff. There are only two pairs of witch hats and one of nine arrived with the cloth broken. üò≠
4.0,"Im a size 36 C so i bought a large thinking i would go up a size like i normally do. Whatever you normally wear for a top, get that. I shouldve gotten a medium but its still super cute on. just a little lose"
4.0,"I agree with another person's review. The colors are more faded. The picture isn't a high-low tunic but the item I received is.<br /><br />The fabric weight is heavier for fall and cooler spring weather. I will wear it in the winter too but I don't like heavy, winter clothing.<br /><br />If the tunic would have been exactly like the<br />picture I would have rated it 5.<br /><br />The selier also represents it as a tunic not maternity then on another area it's listed as maternity.  I chose it *not* as maternity and was surprised when I clicked further the information stated maternity. So, if you're not pregnant this is a nice tunic like others I have purchased. It was represented as plus size on one area but not in the original area? This item offer is confusing lol"
4.0,"These pajamas are super soft; I call them my ""hug"" pjs. They are so comfortable and sublimely soft, everyone should have this set. The red cardinals with the white background is like cardinals in the snow, so pretty."
4.0,Good shoes as expected.
4.0,"I love the colors, but greatly disappointed when the manufacturer sent with white plastic buttons. NOW Shown. After asking me to send a picture of what I reveived; the photo on Amazon then changed from the original photo, which were red buttons. The sender did not try to make it right for the customer. In order to make it work, I purchased black/white pocka-dot material to customize (making the white buttons to seem intentional). The quality of the material is good."
4.0,Received my caps.<br />Cute patterns. Very happy with the lightweight design. Not bulky at all.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e64841db5710ab2b490c9414d1bab3ca]] Finejo Women's Vintage 3/4 Sleeve Office Work Business Party Bodycon Dress<br /><br />This is a nice dress for just about any occasion.  As I get older, I don't like to show off my arms,<br />so when I find clothing that has 3/4 length sleeves I jump on it.  This is a good summer weight<br />dress.<br /><br />I was offered this dress for a promotional price for consumer testing purposes.  I was very excited<br />to try it because of the sleeve length.  There are things about this dress I like and some I don't.<br /><br />The bodice is nice.  The black is a very dark black and looks and feels great.<br />The fabric is light weight but not so much that it is see through.  There is a<br />rouching detail giving the square cut neckline a sweetheart effect.  And of course, I<br />really like the sleeve length.  The only thing about the bodice I don't like is the neckline is very open.<br />I feel very exposed when I wear it. It eliminates this outfit for the work place for me.  But it could be<br />worn for a evening event or dinner out.<br /><br />The skirt feel like a lighter fabric than the top.  You can see through the skirt so you must wear a<br />slip with it.  I am very petite.  Only 5 feet tall.  The waist sits a little low for my body and makes<br />me look even shorter.  I had hoped the print would create the opposite effect.  I think if you are 5'5&#34; or taller, this<br />dress would look amazing.<br /><br />The fabric is a nylon spandex blend.  It is meant to be body conscious and hug the curves.<br />Fabric care for this dress is very simple.  It is machine washable and dry on low setting.<br />When I examined the stitching.  It looks good.  Seam lines are straight and tight. No problem<br />with workmanship.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice dress. The dress is cute, just not on me.<br />For someone of average height, it would look lovely.  I am planning on gifting<br />this dress to a friend who is much taller than I am.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01DGB71EW FINEJO Women's Vintage 3/4 Sleeve Office Work Business Party Bodycon Dress]]<br />Item received at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes."
4.0,Does what it should.  Polishing cloths are never perfect and this works as well as any I have ever bought.  It is easy to use when in a hurry and shines up the item nicely.
4.0,"Really fast delivery, item as advertised and appears identical to picture. Changing date and time was easy, but day of the week was a bit tricky, but finally got it to work."
4.0,This women watch is beautiful. It is too early to say something about the working life etc. I hope will last for a long time.
4.0,I bought these for an elderly lady that I take care of and she absolutely loved them
4.0,"I was looking for another band when the holes on my original wore out. I tried several different ones, a magnetic clasp which seemed to catch on the refrig. door and anything else metal it came near.  I tried the one you can attach to your clothes, lost it twice when it came off unnoticed. One that had a buckle like traditional but was silicone/vinyl, it literally cracked apart in pieces. All were more expensive than this one. I have had it for a while now and no issues. It is only slightly stiffer than the original but for the price, it can't be beaten."
4.0,ordered 2 packs got one
4.0,"So I was looking for linen shorts and for some reason I did not read the description better on this short. It is a thicker material and stretchy but not spandex. The material is soft and comfortable. I usually wear an 18 and ordered up because you could tell from the size chart these are foreign sized. I am glad I did. They fit. If you are larger than an 18-20, these would not fit unless you like your shorts tight. I got the washed black color and am pleased."
4.0,Christmas present.  Recipient loves it
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but I can only wear with leggings because it is really big!
4.0,"Very light, looks good. Polarization could be a bit darker.  All in all, good sunglasses."
4.0,Nice and dainty
4.0,A little big for my small head. All in all good product I would by again great product for the price
4.0,"Super cute top. It is a fitted top, so size up if you like it loose. This is not for long torso‚Äôs or those that don‚Äôt want to show their waistline at all. Loved the color and I will probably order another one soon."
4.0,Material is s little thinner than expected but my daughter loves it!
4.0,"I really wanted to LOVE this scarf because the design is so beautiful; however, it is a bit short for me."
4.0,Awesome jacket. Only problem: lint. Lint gets stuck on it very easily.
4.0,Runs a little small. Size up.
4.0,"For a swim cover, this is great.  However, I don't really see myself wearing this one out and about.  The fabric is a nice weight, but the fit is a little too loose and weird.  Also, there are ties in the front that make this look less than polished when being worn as &#34;day wear.&#34;  While this may be a true kimono fit, the sleeves are really wide and look too bulky.  The colors are nice, but the prints are pretty loud.  Nice swim cover, but this is just too &#34;much&#34; for me to wear anywhere else besides the pool and home.  Quality is good, though."
4.0,Wish they were stretchy around the waist
4.0,"I‚Äôm a welder so I wanted something that wouldn‚Äôt get all marked up and wasn‚Äôt super expensive either. I like this ring, comfortable enough to forget it‚Äôs there. Does seem to get a little beat up but so far so good"
4.0,"The large was too big in the chest area but the medium was too small. I‚Äôm a 36b bra size for reference. Though the medium fit better everywhere else, I don‚Äôt think I could breathe in it for too long lol.<br />Beautiful royal blue color and well made though, so I would definitely buy the larger size and tailor it."
4.0,Didn't hold up well
4.0,"Light weight, good for travel"
4.0,"Cute and not see-through. I ordered large, my normal size, and they were too big. Based on my experience, I'd say order one size down. Also note that mine were rather low-riding."
4.0,"I am the toolbox that always hooks his glasses on the back of his head when inside. This combined with drinking and laughter equals glasses always falling off onto the floor, equals scratched lenses, equals sad man. After about 2 million episodes of this, I decided to toss my favorite glasses, when my buddy stopped me and told me I could simply replace the lenses. Joe's glasses always look new, and mine looked I used sand paper to clean them. Anyway, he hipped me to Amazon for these lenses and I am now as bright and shiny as Joe. I will say, these aren't as dark as the OEM lenses, and they are polarized, which once caused me to freak out at the gas station while pumping petrol. Amidst getting a bucks worth, I was trying to pay at the pump but couldn't see the screen. I must have looked like an idiot, when I realized the problem. The lenses completely block out the writing on the screen! Other than that, these lenses are very nice and easily installed. I will frequent this seller, as I am an idiot that can't keep his eye wear on his head."
4.0,I would pay more for a bit more to the sock. They look good; quality is good; but - might I suggest reinforcing the heel? That will be the eventual breaking point. I really like the relaxed feel on my calf. They stay up pretty well and the relaxed fit helps a lot with swelling calves/ankles. Hard to find Argyle socks; I am buying more of these. Reinforcing the heel would be a good improvement; and as I said - I'd gladly pay more. While you're at it - a bit longer in length. They do run a bit small.
4.0,I like the tunic.  It fits my bust and hips just fine.  It is a little fitted around the middle but not too clingy.  It is comfortable and seems to be good quality.
4.0,"The lenses seem pretty nice.  They are light weight and the polarization is pretty good for inexpensive glasses.  They came with a leash, wipe, bag and hard case.  The frames aren't the best, but they feel pretty good on.  If they hold up, they will be great glasses for the price."
4.0,Have not eaten them in heat yet.
4.0,I like this top and it‚Äôs wearable but wish it came in smaller sizes. The one size is more like a M/L and I‚Äôm on the smaller side. At least you can tighten this top from the back though. Pretty design and nice light fabric.
4.0,I would give this five stars except that it looks a little too masculine. It is nicely made and attractive.
4.0,"Larger than what I expected.  Buy, still cute."
4.0,"Nice and typical swim suit quality, i though length would be a bit longer but its short"
4.0,"Bright, saturated colors. Nice size, good quality clasps"
4.0,"We really like these rompers. They are light weight fabric that is soft to touch, cute prints and easy to wear - the material is stretchy so its easy to get in and out/change diapers in - has snaps to open and close without having to remove the leg like the carter ones . The reason i gave it 4 stars was the price. $20 for a 2 piece romper that is not even 100% cotton (its 60% cotton) feels like it is a bit much. But other than that, the prints are cute. The color doesn't run when you wash it with like colors in delicate cycle and we throw it in the dryer on a low setting and it comes out looking as good as new. Overall we like it and if you don't mind that it is $20 for something that isn't 100% cotton, go for it."
4.0,I love the color of this bag.  It is much larger than the one I have beaten into rags by traveling extensively with it since 2014.  It will take me a bit of time to get used to the bigger size.
4.0,Great fit. Minimal  slippage.
4.0,Very cute small brouches that you can wear together or separately.
4.0,It's a little tight. Though it says it will fits most head sizes it was very snug. I cut a small bit byseem in the back and made it a little more comfortable. Looks great though!
4.0,"First I bought this dress in dark blue with Irises and roses all over in a size XL. It fits a little snug in the chest, but is otherwise just what I was hoping for. I suspect a proper undergarment will help with the fit. I also bought a blue dress with a single rose on the skirt in XL. That dress didn't fit me at all, but I passed it on to someone much thinner, who is pleased to have it.<br /><br />I decided that I liked the dress enough that it was worth trying the next larger size which was XXL, since I'm planning to wear it to a wedding and I want to be comfortable enough to enjoy myself. That dress was far too big!<br /><br />I love the style of this dress as well as the fabric and prints, but the sizes are completely inconsistent and frustrating!<br /><br />In the photo, the dress on the left is XL and the right is XXL."
4.0,"a little short for me, but still looks pretty"
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress that is made out of a denim/cotton type Tencel material. The inside has the red plaid lining only through the upper chest. The bottom of the dress does not have plaid peaking out except in the seam that runs down either side on the inside. Definitely follow the size chart! This material has ZERO stretch and so it will be a squeeze to zip up if you order too small. I normally order small or xtra small in women's clothing assuming they have some stretch at that the sizing usually runs big. That is definitely not the case here. I returned the small for a medium and it is still slightly tight through the lower waist. I am 5'4&#34; around 138 lbs, 36.5-30-38 measurements, so more of a rectangular shape. I can tell that this is intended for hourglass figures with a longer torso. I am short waisted and the shoulder area was a little big in the medium, okay through the chest, and tighter down around the lower belly. The material is a beautiful shiny denim color and the two black metallic zippers work from both directions so it can be worn as some sort of vest or cardigan if you want. The included belt is nice as well. The material does seem to wrinkle easily (wasn't ironed in my pictures though!) but is not see-through."
4.0,"These pads seem to have saved my new booties from being horribly uncomfortable.. I tried the foot petals, moleskin...all did not work for this issue because the bottom of my heel was rubbing against the back of the boot, this is the only type of pad that could address this, because of the connection between the heel back and foot sole.<br /><br />I like the smooth material of the pads and the adhesive doesn't ruin the inside of my shoe. However, it seems to have lost some stickiness after 1 adjustment so it's quite annoying to put my shoes on since the pad folds over. I may need to get another one to fix this. Once the shoe is on though, the pad is great. The gel cushion at the heel is a little firm , but I feel it gets softer with more wears.<br /><br />I especially like the design of the pads because it protects the bottom of my foot - where the heel and foot bottom meet - which is an area many other heel pads don't/can't address."
4.0,"Love the jacket just that the zipper is kinda sharp I would say, so if u ran ur finger across it it's not a curved zipper. Also there was a lot of extra thread I had to cut off myself. But other than those two things this is a really nice jacket it would've been five stars if it wasn't for those two things"
4.0,"Got this for my wife on our 5 year wedding anniversary. She was delighted with it and even happier that I looked up that the 5th anniversary was wood, so I got that going for me.<br /><br />The watch came in a well crafted wooden box which surprised both of us. Our 4 year old loved it too, so I haven‚Äôt seen it since he discovered it.<br /><br />All in all, I‚Äôd say it was a successful purchase."
4.0,"Super cute, comfortable, and soft. I ordered the largest size available and the shirt was still a lil snug around the belly area"
4.0,Airlines and other businesses might not allow you to wear this type of mask (with the vent).  Other than that... it's comfortable and functional.<br /><br />I did have to resew the nose clamps into place.
4.0,Used for rain
4.0,". . . very, very small ."
4.0,"This dress was perfect for cooler evenings on summer vacation. Light weight, hangs nicely, and kept the chill off my arms! I‚Äôd buy it again!"
4.0,"Beautiful ring, vibrant purple color, sparkling. The cubic stones are very tiny not sparkling. A good casual ring, fits perfectly."
4.0,"AN KINGPiiN Flower Men's Lapel Pins Handmade Satin Boutonniere is nicely designed and quite attractive. The fabric petals have a total 1.375 inch diameter and are an inch thick.  The gold tone metal leaf provides a firm base.<br /><br />The pin is unisex and an ideal lapel pin, especially for jackets that have a boutonniere buttonhole.  For lapels that do not, the type of material may be the determining factor on use.  This pin is fairly thick which may leave a hole in a fragile fabric like silk. The pin is not very sharp and so needs to be forced through some fabric.<br /><br />In addition to use as a lapel boutonniere, this flower pin can be used an a fashion accessory.  I am using it on a straw hat where it makes a colorful accent.<br /><br />AN KINGPiiN Flower Men's Lapel Pins Handmade Satin Boutonniere is as described and does make a very attractive boutonniere."
4.0,I like the automatic and eco-drive combinations
4.0,These are very nice colors and can bring a dash of color to any outfit. I like that it came in a nice little bag.  The colors are nice but not too flashy.  I think that if you are looking or a man who wears ties that this would be a perfect gift or them. I bought this as a Christmas present and he really liked them.
4.0,cute top runs a little small
4.0,"Not all the socks were the same size, there was a range of Jurassic park, cars, animals, and star wars socks in it so it was a bunch of socks from different packs.  Overall, my kiddo loved the ones that fit. They weren't all tube socks though."
4.0,"Product was good and shipping was fast.<br /><br />Label said ""Made in Korea"" and 100% Acrylic, and didn't have any issues after multiple machine wash.  Though, there's no elastic or anything that keeps it tight on your head.<br /><br />The brown color faded slightly after a couple of washes, but did not stretch or had any problems with loose threads.<br /><br />But slight problem with size.  The size is smaller than expected, and if you have a bigger or longer head or even poofy hair, this is not for you. Thus, 4 stars."
4.0,Love the sweater just didn't fit as expected..need to go up a size if have wider hips.
4.0,My daughter is 2 and a half years old and it fits perfectly.  The description did say it ran a little small so I bought a size up...
4.0,I like it but makes me look larger than I am
4.0,Beautiful dress and good quality however it does run large my daughter is 4.5 and weights 37lbs so she is slender we will return the 4-5 we ordered for a 3-4
4.0,"Sturdy and pretty. A little stiff, but not too stiff. Excellent case for the price."
4.0,the sleeves need to be an ooch larger...or  measurements are needed for lower arm...Love the top...going to adjust somehow...Great fabric for hot summers in texas...and simple enough to make a great statement
4.0,"This works with my existing bras to lower my back straps and keep cleavage in place. I took off one star because I had to tighten the strap all the way to keep my bra in place, so this does that a tourniquet-like effect on my waist. It wasn't uncomfortable but can't be worn with fitted clothing."
4.0,Not Hoochy at all but I'm not stuffed into it like a burrito.  It is perfect for<br />night out and feels great on
4.0,"These are really cute and colorful.  And best of all, they are pretty strong!!  They don't fell like they will stretch out too quickly."
4.0,Very cool a little larger than expected but still very happy.
4.0,Smaller then I expected but I like the look!!
4.0,Like it but the only one this size that seemed a bit smaller
4.0,Very nice. The only thing that I would change is the snaps. This is a nice bracelet and I wouldn't want to lose it because the snap came loose. So I am going to put super glue on it. Only because I don't take my bracelets off. But I am very happy.
4.0,"Very nice, good material. I have a long body and is was a little short on my torso. Dress it up or down. Bought the red one and it is a really nice color"
4.0,"I love wearing these everyday.  They are tight but that's what I want.  I do have to adjust and pull them down sometimes...they tend to ride up after you have been sitting.  Of course, if I lost some weight then I'd have them fit better...so it's not all the Spanx fault now is it?  I actually don't feel right not wearing one...it's now my go to armor."
4.0,"I like it, It was just what I was looking for and the quality is very good."
4.0,Wish the tie was the same color as the pants
4.0,"It's pretty and fits as expected. The material is not exactly as I expected. It's a bit heavier and bulkier then I intended. Despite that, the color is nice and the blouse looks great. It's very cute."
4.0,"I have the heather gray top, and it looks exactly as it does in the pictures.  The ruffles around the sleeves and at the bottom add a nice touch.  The lightweight fabric works well for the warmer season.  It‚Äôs made of 62% polyester, 34% rayon and 4% spandex.  There‚Äôs plenty of stretch, and it‚Äôs quite soft as well.  I have the size Large, and it measures 18‚Äù from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  It measures 14‚Äù across at the bottom.  Made in Indonesia.<br /><br />A very similar top is offered by the same company, but in different colors.  Also the fabric is ‚Äúribbed‚Äù.  Check it out at the link below.<br />[[ASIN:B075YFQSKJ Something for Everyone Women's Cropped Ruffle Edge Ribbed Top]]"
4.0,"I ordered an 8/9 for my very petite 10 year old girl. It fit her perfectly, once I adjusted the straps."
4.0,"Comfortable, looks nice, washes well, lighter weight than a sweatshirt but heavier than a tree shirt. Perfect for Colorado weather changes"
4.0,Just a little thin like pajamas
4.0,"These socks are very comfortable, not scratchy and very warm."
4.0,"This shirt is cool, but the names of the constellations seem unreliable. Infact, one of them is called poop! on the back of the shirt."
4.0,"It does look exactly as pictured but it is way too small. I normally wear a medium in dresses so I ordered a medium. I am 5‚Äô2, c cup and have hips. This dress is not meant for curves! It is so short that my butt sticks out, I was so sad because it is really adorable. I am just wearing it with leggings...I don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of sending it back."
4.0,Long noses well protected from FL sun.  Priced right.
4.0,"These leggings are pretty good Lululemon align dupes, but of course not the real thing. I like them a lot, the only thing I will say is that in the back there is a seam on the waistband that is too low on the butt and potentially unflattering. Otherwise, these are solid leggings!"
4.0,My 7 yr old daughter was recently diagnosed with a tilted bladder. So she has to go every 2 hours. She was having trouble remembering in school so we tried this to help remind her. The vibration mode is awesome in class so it doesn‚Äôt disturb everyone. Just be prepared to take 30 mins to set the thing.
4.0,A little snug for the size
4.0,Zipper broke after 2 weeks used<br />Need to find how to fix<br />Kept me warm
4.0,"Lovely, looked even prettier in real"
4.0,I would size up by one size.
4.0,"Love this dress!  I used it for my Olivia the Pig costume.  I had my mother temporarily sew my daughters old tights inside the cap sleeves. To look like I was wearing a striped t-shirt underneath.  It fit me exactly, so wearing a t-shirt underneath was not an option.  I love the color and cannot wait to unsew the temporary sleeves to wear it again for Valentine's Day since it has heart shaped buttons.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it came undone at the side seem.  I will have to have my mother sew it before I wear it again."
4.0,"I purchased these earrings for myself and they are very cute and very pretty. They look true to the online photos. Seem to be made well and were packaged very nicely. My only problem is the climber earrings with the long and curved horizontal stem in the back, makes the earring 'fall vertically' down my earlobe instead of staying in the 'climbing up' the earlobe position for some reason. I don't know if I could be doing something wrong, but I do believe I am wearing them correctly. I definitely would give these earrings as a gift. I am pleased with the pricing. Thank you!"
4.0,"Super cute and comfy but it's kind of a weird fit. My shoulders didn't fit good in this thing, it was too big but my body and arms were ok. Haven't washed it yet so not sure how it will fit then. But I got it for cheap so I can't complain too much. Just wish the shoulders fit better"
4.0,Nice fit comfortable
4.0,Super cute with jeans..
4.0,"This was a hit! I need more colors. I have to get dark colors, because the material is kind of thin."
4.0,Fits like expected and great deal!!
4.0,Wow so beautiful products from Amazon! Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è It look so Rich ü§ë
4.0,"Cute little bag, bigger then what I thought!"
4.0,"I never know if I'm going to be a medium or a small, in this case I went medium and it's a tad big but still wearable and looks nice. Nice stretchy material so a small probably would have fit more like I expected it too. Looks very cute though and I got several compliments wearing it."
4.0,Cute tankini top arrived today. Size 16-18 and XXL fits right. Soft material. No underwire but padded cups that are not removeable. The photo shown depicts straps that go over the shoulders and down the back but mine crisscrosses in the back by design. It is not a deal breaker but not really what I wanted however the straps are very comfortable. Looks great with both my little swim skirt bottoms and regualr ones. (The bottoms do not come with the top.)
4.0,This is so flexible to wear. Lounge around the house or wear out in public.
4.0,I like the higher socks in the winter.  Children are always on the floor and when their pants ride up a little the high socks keep their legs warm.
4.0,"The color is a lot more orange than red, and a lot lighter. Sad because it is very comfortable!"
4.0,Quality is good but does not stay on when sleeping.
4.0,"I enjoyed this dress. I got it for under $10 too.<br /><br />Its a fun look. It is a cheap dress though. But it has a great shape. The edges are not hemmed. So, I do worry how many washes it will survive. The material was thin and I had to throw on a tank under the dress.<br /><br />I don't know what happen with the other reviewer and her not sewn together dress (quality control issues probably), but mine didn't have that problem.<br /><br />Attached is a mirror selfie (sorry for the picture quality)."
4.0,"Cute, the top was a little big so returned."
4.0,"This dress is made pretty well for the price.  It's a medium weight rayon that drapes nicely.  The sizing is a bit off.  I'm 5'3"" and a size 12 and carry most of my weight in the middle section and hips.  I have an extra large and I can very rarely wear an extra large in anything.  This is a little large on me in the top but there is elastic on the back so it's just more drapey across my upper back.  The v neck is deeper on me than shown and has some cleavage action.  It's not exposing anything but I'll probably wear a cute bralette with it just in case.  The sleeves are a bit long but they don't look bad because there is elastic at the wrists.  This is not a fit and flair dress.  It is A line from the bust so it is closer fitting in the skirt.  If you have wide hips or wish to have something loose around the tummy, this may not work especially if you typically wear an extra large in dresses.  The size chart says the XL is a 16/18 but I'd say this is more like a 12.  Since I'm short, the length is mid-thigh and a good length for a short dress.  I put up a pic to show the pink pattern up close.  There are several pink shades going on with a little mustard, navy, and brown.  It's a nice pattern and would look good with tights and booties in cooler months or even tennis shoes when warmer."
4.0,Fits pretty good!
4.0,I love this cap. I expect to buy a few more before the end of the year. the cap is a bit too large. if you have a big head then this cap is perfect for you!!!
4.0,Not easy at all to get the bag locked properly<br />Be advised to take your time when trying to find the small grommets at the end of the tether
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little longer than I thought so it will be used as only a dress. The material is a little too thin which makes it cheap looking. You would need a body slip so it won‚Äôt see through. A chunky necklace and boots will improve the look. After all, for $17, what should I expect. I think I wanted a Cotton thermal dress and that‚Äôs what I ‚Äúsaw‚Äù."
4.0,Cute outfit. Sexy
4.0,Great for kids goody bags. Very sturdy hook.
4.0,"I just received this bracelet today.  You can't beat the price for a lot of bling, especially if you are going out."
4.0,They fit well and are comfortable I love them
4.0,bought this Belt after reading most of the reviews and I could not be happier.  Loved the look and the fit was perfect didn't have any issues of it rolling down stayed put all day.  I also didn't have any of the formaldehyde or moth ball smell some other reviewers had complained about.  All in all I would definitely recommend this belt and I may even order some of the other colors for myself.  Can't beat the price.
4.0,"I like the design and execution of this band, and quality is still good after wearing for about a week. The only reason I returned them is that they are too long for my wrists, so band end is squeezed badly if I hook to the last second hole or I have to wear loosely"
4.0,"I cannot say for sure if this is a real ray bans case or not. If I had to guess I would lean towards no but with that said this case is amazing. It fits my standard aviators with no problem at all. I am confident putting them in my flight bag now and not being scared they will bend or break. The case snaps shut very nicely and with a microfiber cloth inside it holds them very secure. If it‚Äôs not ray bans, it is at the very least ray ban quality."
4.0,Decent shades. Polarization is nice but my only complaint is the ear pieces are too long. I even have a long head and they stick out a ways behind my ears. Almost impossible to wear a hat with these.
4.0,These were very nice boots I had to send back because heel was too high for me.
4.0,SIZE UP<br />soft and comfortable. no zippers just a button to fasten
4.0,Very light weight....extremely clear and sharp visual wise. My only reason for 4 stars being they easily slide off my head due to them being so light.
4.0,Love these pants would have given 5 stars but they are a little baggy in the butt area. The rest fits great so it might just be my body type. While they are a little baggy they still worked great. If you are looking for sizing help I got a medium and am 5‚Äô1 143lbs.
4.0,Shows sweat and water fairly obviously.
4.0,"Very comfortable shoes. However, the width seems extra large. I feel like I have duck feet. Too comfortable to return though..."
4.0,"Fits as expected, but a little thinner than I though. So best used when warmer."
4.0,Look so cute in the picture. Just as cute in person; imagined her wearing them with shorts. Not sure if we will but they were as expected. Fit the 2.5 year old great. Thanks!
4.0,It was a bit too big
4.0,"I hate umbrellas, so this is perfect."
4.0,"I bought this product to clean my sons‚Äô atletic shoes- 12 yo boys. One pair is a cream colored mesh and both have white foam around the bottoms. The liquid did brighten the cream mesh, and prior to that we used a wipe which also helped. The foam bottom also improved. The only part that did not brighten was a plastic white medallion on the back of the shoe...it was stained blue from their jeans. Overall, very pleased with the products. Great value for the price!"
4.0,I ordered this for my daughter she loves it.
4.0,"Loved it!!! Comfortable, wasn't expensive and it was a big hit!!!"
4.0,Cute and comfortable sandals. My daughter loves them
4.0,"Well made, thick and fairly soft. My son won‚Äôt wear it because the pattern looks too feminine to him. He says it is girly.  It has a basket weave type pattern and then transitions into rib knit at the fold so it doesn‚Äôt look great worn unfolded and that is how he wears beanies. Returning.  Seems warm though, best for cold temps."
4.0,"Looks like the picture but it's darker. It fits tight on the shoulders but overall, good quality. Looks great!"
4.0,The fit was great. The pattern is beautiful and it is so soft.
4.0,"I got a size small and I‚Äôm a size 4 with a height of 5‚Äô5, and bust size of 32d. I love this it‚Äôs super soft, not see through, easily dressed up or down. My only complaints are 1. No zipper I feel like I‚Äôm gonna stretch the neck out putting it on. And 2. The tie at the waist seems like it could be better designed I wish it had an elastic waist or something. The material around the waist is more than I needed and the tie just seems a bit sloppily added there but it does the job..."
4.0,"Great earrings and color is perfect. They stick out a little farther than I thought they would, hence 4 stars. Overall I love the earrings from this company because of the overall quality"
4.0,"I was hoping for a little bit better quality hat but I didn't pay much for it, so can I really complain?  It's not a reinforced hat and seems a little cheap.  I'm completely bald and live in AZ, so I go through hats pretty quickly in this climate.  I do not think that I would buy this hat again.  I would more than likely go with the Reebok one I had prior to this one.  I guess you'd call this a slouch hat?  Whatever.  Meh, rawkage."
4.0,"I liked it, but I ordered the wrong size. Even for small, I gave it to one of my co-workers to try and it he thought it was too small, and he was size S. It's a great shirt, so too bad I had to return it."
4.0,These earrings are very well-made and the color is very pretty. The only reason I couldn‚Äôt give it five stars is because they were too heavy for my taste. I wish they had come in a smaller size.
4.0,"Runs a little small.  I had to return the first one I ordered and get a bigger size, but it is very flattering and I really enjoy wearing it."
4.0,"The material is nice and thick, so you don't need a slip or fancy invisible underwear! And it's cute? How? Sadly, I think my cleavage is too much in the dress since it's for a baptism. I ordered a size Small (34-28-36) but I've got 34DDD to complicate the fit. It's a great dress and I'm sure it's cute in other colors as well, but for right now, it's not appropriate for the occasion I'm purchasing for."
4.0,"Very nice leggings, but is a bit wide at the ankles."
4.0,Small not big! Does not stretch not as soft giftable to the mother's of my church really didn't get a reaction of dislike or like.
4.0,"Yes, I like this scarf. Would give it a 5 but it has gold trim that doesn't show in picture, not too fond of that"
4.0,Looks good but slightly tighter than expected.
4.0,I liked the sweatshirt but it runs a little small. I returned it and bought a larger size haven't received it yet.
4.0,"I purchased 2 of these dresses in size 12, larger than my normal size just in case they ran small across the waist and knew I could get them altered.  Both dresses ran so small that I had my daughter who wears size 6/8 try them on and they fit her snuggly.  We kept one for her.  The dresses themselves are beautiful, the colors are true to the site, the only problem was the sizing which does not match the sizing chart."
4.0,"I purchased this to match my daughter's costume. As a female, I didn't expect this to fit incredibly well as it is a man's costume. (I didn't like the female version of this costume because it didn't cover enough) It served its purpose and didn't break the bank."
4.0,I use my husbands account. This review was actually left by Bethany Sanderson. I'm a size 10 and these fit great. Wash first separate. There is some color smearing on the first wash. No issues after. Seamless under clothes. Comfy to wear.
4.0,"The size is too small on chest area and I am only almost B. The quality is eeeh!!! Definitely not worth 21 bucks...<br /><br />25 March 2016 UPDATE:<br /><br />Still great after washing. Fun to wear as well, people will start callingl you &#34;Ms. Captain America."
4.0,I adore this kimono... but it‚Äôs HUGE. I‚Äôm a solid large and the size small kimono looks like a sack. If the pattern and material wasn‚Äôt great I‚Äôd return it.
4.0,Great slippers but ran on smaller side for my husband
4.0,Very soft but order 2 sizes up at the least. Colors were bright and it appears well made
4.0,Loved these night gowns the head hole was a bit small in the unicorn ones
4.0,"Fit was fine, lace was scratchy on my legs and one of the buttons fell off right away. I sewed it back on and reinforced the other buttons. Not a high quality piece of work by any means, but served its function as a costume piece with some effort on my part."
4.0,Run a little large and really pointy and narrow. I've liked skating pointy shoes in the past but I wasn't too excited about these ones.
4.0,I've only worn them twice so far. Very comfortable and fit well.
4.0,I like that they don't slip but they are a little tight
4.0,Very comfortable but slightly unflattering<br />Get a size below if your like them more form fitting
4.0,"It fits as expected, colors are bright but the fabric is very tick compared to other coolibar swimsuit we had."
4.0,"I'm a plus size girl, 5'2"" about 190lbs. My waist is 39"", bust 44"", hips 49"". I think I ordered a large or X-Large. It fits great. Although, it is cheaply made and shouldn't cost so much. Shipping was pretty fast, it came early. I would highly recommend buying this."
4.0,"Overall, this dress is the perfect go to!!! It runs a size or two large, but the tie helps to minimize that issue."
4.0,cute and elegant
4.0,This is a great little watch! The packaging is very cute and made it very fun to open. I think this would be really great gift for a loved one. It does feel a little cheap in the hand (it looks nicer in the picture) but it's a hard price to beat for $20. I recommend it!
4.0,The material is not very thick but the pants are good
4.0,good quality and fast delivery...somewhat small but not enough to justify a return or the larger size
4.0,Comfortable running shorts that fit nicely and don't move during a workout as long as the waist strings are tied and the legs never ride up.  These shorts would be absolutely perfect if they had front side pockets!
4.0,"These are good shades, unlike some you find on-line."
4.0,Good colors and very accurate Stihl logo.<br />Color fading after washing is an issue
4.0,Buying a 2nd pair
4.0,Great case dor glasses and other items dor those on the go.
4.0,I ordered two sizes to evaluate fit. I am just a bit larger than a 10 because of long 2 nd toes. I am fine with the 10.5.<br />They fit as expected in the length<br />They are not bulky looking like the lslip-ons I tried. I love Merrells but the longer the shoe the less attractive they are!  I have a long thin foot and I wish the shoes were more proportional
4.0,Perfect but longer on one side
4.0,Good quality! Fits nice but would order one size bigger if you want it baggier!
4.0,El el lente muy oscuro
4.0,I bought this for my niece and she loves it
4.0,"Nice and long and big enough for a big guy. The neck opening is a little small for a plus sized garment. My husband has to really tug to get his head through.  Other than that, this is a great poncho."
4.0,"UPDATE 2/12/18:  These are warm in temperatures above freezing so far, will update again on a colder day.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Not as pretty as they appeared on screen but fit as intended.  I have active length nails and am a tall woman.  I don't know if my fingers are long or average; my hand is definitely not mammoth.  I will update after I've had a chance to wear them for warmth."
4.0,GOOD QUALITY AND PRICE.
4.0,"i did not take them out of the packaging and ended up returning them. i did not pay attention to the size dimensions listed and only looked at the pictures when ordering. they are definitely 1&#34; long - a bit too big and they did feel a little heavy in my hand. if they were a little smaller, i would have kept them."
4.0,"This shirt is just like the photo and, just as described. I gave it 4 stars because of me not the top. I'm chesty and the top is flowy so it's not the most flattering top I own. It comes down plenty long enough to be worn with leggings. It's so soft you could live in it. I would highly recommend especially for those that aren't too endowed. The bust makes mine stick out off of my body looking slightly more like a maternity top but, I'm still going to be wearing it."
4.0,I got the med in olive. Fits as expected. It's really soft but it's shorter than I was hoping.
4.0,This shirt is a shiny material not what you would expect for a sweatshirt. The tie dye is nice. It fits like a sweatshirt should on the loose side.
4.0,"Love the style, just should've gotten a smaller size"
4.0,This tank is super cute and stylish. Fits true to size. I am a size 2/4 and the small fits perfectly.
4.0,I love my sweater coat. The fit was perfect and it was very warm even in very cold winter weather.  Since I‚Äôve only worn it once I‚Äôm giving it four stars; I want to see if the quality holds up after I wash it a couple of times.
4.0,"Nice bag. Big and sturdy. Design is great too. Just a little thin in the width, but otherwise a super buy."
4.0,"This bag has plenty of pockets and is very useful for carrying things around all day. The lining of one of the exterior pockets ripped within a week of buying it, but it hasn't affected the functionality of the bag. A month later and it's been holding up well!"
4.0,LOVE THIS DRESS! I saw a blogger post about it and immediately purchased. I am a busty gal and felt adequately covered.  They ONLY drawback to the dress is the cream color is sheer and you need to wear a slip with it. Overall great find!
4.0,IT WILL SNAG! BUT LOOKS CUTE ON.
4.0,Nice watch band. Pricey for a watchband.
4.0,"LOVE THE DRESS, SOMEWHAT SMALL INSTEAD OF SENDING IT BACK FOR A LARGER SIZE I WILL LOSE A FEW POUNDS AND IT WILL FIT PERFECTLY. COLOR IS REAL NICE."
4.0,A little tight in my arms.
4.0,"Pants fit great, material was nice."
4.0,Snagged the first day
4.0,Although the shirt was a little big my son absolutely loved it! I think the style is supposed to be a little big and he didn't mind at all. He loves the feel of it
4.0,"Not as long as I would have liked, but great quality and durability.  I would order a size down next time.  I ordered a medium."
4.0,They are super cute and stylish.The fit was great.They look forever to get to me..
4.0,"This is very short, so it is probably best work with tights, unless that's the look you're going for. I am 5'5&#34; and it barely covers my butt. I ended up giving it to my cousin who is 5'2&#34; and she loved it."
4.0,a little flimsy
4.0,"For a cami, this is super small and hard to toss on and off quickly but as shapewear, it is pretty amazing. It comes with adjustable straps and the length is really nice since it goes down past your hips. Since it is slimming shapewear, it's designed to go on tight to flatten and smooth out your bumps and bulges. It does that for sure, but for that functionality, you have to work to get it on and off. The material is very soft and once on, comfortable to wear daily under other tops or just by itself. I have a problem area in my tummy so I like how it controls the bulge, but if I am active, it starts to roll up a bit. Would I buy others? Yes, because it does look nice under sheer tops and smooths my lines for tighter fitting clothes. But, I would like it a bit longer to avoid the roll up around my middle. Good shaper overall.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion and I am in no way obligated to leave a certain rating. I rely on reviews when making my own purchase decisions and only provide honest reviews after using or testing a product. I hope this helps you in making your own purchase decisions."
4.0,It's a nice hat and it fits well but it's a little puffy.
4.0,Received in a timely manner and are very comfortable.
4.0,"Thicker material tank, doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. But the print is not really ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, sort of tinted or darker looking. It‚Äôs not a loose or flowy tank, I ordered a M and I‚Äôm a 36D- it was snug but comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and it went down to my hips so it‚Äôs sort of long."
4.0,I liked the siize and weight .  Also the colors are excellent.
4.0,Kinda cheap looking but for the price it's really nice
4.0,Color is great - cheery
4.0,"Fits great ordered a larger size than needed, however could have went down a size"
4.0,"This dress is so flattering! I am 6‚Äô tall and a size 10, 36DD. This dress shows the curves I like and hides the tummy ones I don‚Äôt. I was afraid of the comments on the short front, and the comments are true. The way the wrap curves up and around, if you‚Äôre over 5‚Äô 7‚Äù, it‚Äôs likely your undies will show!  I decided to layer with a lace skirt extender and I think It a great fix for a lovely dress at a great price!"
4.0,"The clip on's are of excellent quality and came with a solid, clear plastic case that gives excellent protection in our car.<br /><br />The price was good and quick shipment made it all the better."
4.0,Love the band!!
4.0,"Love the rich red color and thick stretchy fabric. Unfortunately the 3X did not fit well. I'm going to reorder a smaller size, but I worry it isn't proportioned for me. The waistline seems a bit high throwing the curves off. I will update when I try the 2X. (5'8"" 210#)"
4.0,Nice need better quality band.
4.0,"Nice fabric, the length is great for tall people to wear as a blouse, others it is a nice tunic."
4.0,"Product arrived on time, thank you.  This is well-made however I cannot figure out why their size LARGE  (for 5‚Äô 7‚Äù 145#) has adequate arm holes but the waist is cut 2‚Äù above the actual waist.  Vest material is like that of a raincoat WITH a thin lining. It sits square on the body w/o shape as was portrayed in picture.  I removed the lining and drawstrings and cinched in the waist a bit. I hope I get some use out of it. It‚Äôs nicely made for an outside Fall vest, but not for the office. If you have a shorter torso this may work well for you."
4.0,I purchased this dress for a company gathering.  Its so classy and it fits well.  I order the small.
4.0,"I am a dishwasher at work. Gloves have held up good, no punctures. I handle a lot of small and large utensils constantly. Great!!!"
4.0,"I love the colors on these rings. They are really cute and add just the right accent, great for working out or the beach. They do not, however, run true to your ring size. I normally wear a 6.5 so went with the 7 and am sadly disappointed that I really needed the 8. I know better, for next time, to go up a full size instead.<br />***disclaimer - I received this product at a discount, in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Best umbrella I've ever used. The strap doesn't seem to want to stay on my shoulder but that's not a big deal to me at all.
4.0,Is too smalm
4.0,"Adorable, great quality, size was on the smaller side."
4.0,Last one I bought the material was weak and began to rib by the pockets and crotch after a couple of weeks. I made sure to buy a size up so it would be a roomy fit. It fits well but the material is cheap for the price of the item.
4.0,Nice Sweatshirt -  Runs larger than expected but that is ok - I would rather have them be a little bigger than too small and not wearable after washing
4.0,Really liked the watch used it when I go shopping to keep track of time :)
4.0,"Warm enough for trips to the zoo in Michigan. They are comfy, I did buy one size up and they fit really well and wash well too."
4.0,"I received this cute little charm for my birthday and I really love it. The colors on the charm are better than the picture and the jewels in the eyes are adorable. While it doesn't screw on the bracelet it's not a big deal, I have a charm from Pandora that doesn't screw in either. So that's not a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />It fits in well with my other charms on my Pandora bracelet. It does seem a little small but when I held it up to my other Pandora charms it really wasn't."
4.0,Surprisingly sturdy!  Very nice looking and comfortable to wear
4.0,Comfortable and loose. I would buy again.
4.0,"Very cute shirt with the lace, however I ordered what I thought was more of a gray shirt and what I received was a bright pink shirt. I was really surprised when I opened the package-so beware that the pink shirt isn‚Äôt a subtle pink/mostly gray like the picture depicts."
4.0,"This dress is so cute! Got the black with pearls after reading reviews. I did get a L, I'm 5'4 145lbs with a little bit of a mom belly, so the large for me works. I probably could have done a M but it would be a little snug in the waist. Perfect length, perfect neck line, bought for wedding reception.  Coming from someone who purchases mostly off of reviews - I recommend!"
4.0,very nice quality socks and well made. Nice and snug
4.0,"Band was black- not green like in the pic. Otherwise, as expected."
4.0,The dress has no stretch and runs small on the waist band part which is why I gave it 4 stars. But I still loved it and made do to pull off my costume.
4.0,Very soft and breatheable.  Thank you
4.0,Nice and arrived quickly
4.0,"This is the third Be Kind product I've ordered and the other two were too small.  I decided to be safe and order an XXL, even though I wear between a Large and Extra Large.  Man, I'm glad I ordered such a large size, otherwise it would have been too small again.  As you can see in the pictures, this is not too big or too long on me.  The sleeves and cuffs are long on me but a typical XXL is huge on me.  I'm only 5'0"" for reference, and this hits me higher than most sweatshirts.  So, you're going to want to order big for this hoodie.  It's soft, comfortable and lightweight, perfect for the upcoming fall weather.  The picture of me wearing this hoodie is after it's been laundered.  I didn't try it on before that so I'm not sure if it shrank in the laundry, but you really need to order a size up."
4.0,This is a decent belt.  It is elastic which I didn't like.
4.0,"Good shoes for the price.<br />They do look cheap, but my kids like them."
4.0,"Love this jacket! The color was exactly what I wanted (I got the coffee one) and it's very stylish. Fits well, except it's a little short in the torso. I opted for a medium even though I'm traditionally a small, and I would definitely urge anyone to order a size up as it fits perfectly everywhere else."
4.0,The colors were nice.  The fabric on the bottom portion has a sheen to it
4.0,"The pendant is small, good for a small-framed person. Very pretty but very tarnished on the back. I tried to polish it off but it wouldn't come off. As this is a gift i wound up ordering a different tree of life. Will probably keep this for myself."
4.0,The chain is pretty short
4.0,"These wrap around visors look and function exactly as promised and pictured. They are a nice snug fit for an average adult, so no worries about these slipping off. Vision is not impaired at all. They were the hit of our sci-fi group. My only issue with them is how the buttons work. To get them started, you need to press both buttons simultaneously. I needed to press fairly hard on them, and for a bit longer than you should have to, so there was no way I could put them on first and then activate them. After they are activated, a single press on either side changes the color of that side--but also sometimes just turns them off. Unclear if I got a bad set, or some almost dead batteries. Luckily the battery can be changed, and it is a common size. As soon as I get some replacements I will test it out. Overall happy with these, hope they work better with new batteries!"
4.0,It's great and is better than I expected for the price.  I don't know how it would make someones hands dirty nor does it look less polish after a couple of months as mentioned in other reviews...
4.0,It hugs a little around the hips but I love the dress. So comfy that I bought 2.
4.0,Good quality hoop. I just wish it was longer. The hoop doesn't fully curl back into my nose.
4.0,Promptly delivered as described . Good quality. Great Organizer.
4.0,Dad in law always wears a 12 he could not wear these so we had to donate them
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but so delicate. Beware, though because this dress is definitely on the shorter side for me since I have quite a big backside. So please order accordingly."
4.0,"Lovely. Good buy. Dressed up or down, you can't go wrong with this piece. Would buy in other colors if found."
4.0,"Purchased for a &#34;onesie&#34; Christmas party and it served it's purpose. Even though it fits somewhat snug, it's not uncomfortably tight. Material is rather thin, but not see-through. I have no problems wearing this again to lounge or sleep in."
4.0,Super cute my daughter loves it. Fits perfectly.
4.0,"Just what I needed, FR work pants that wasn't too expensive."
4.0,Material soft. True to size.
4.0,"The masks are well made; the chin piece holds the mask in place, the adjustable ear loops are great and the vertical design leaves more breathing room.  The inside fabric, however, closest to your skin , could be softer and more comfortable.  Other than that I would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,I really like how well made this top is. It is comfortable. But it runs really small. I usually wear a medium but needed an XL in this.
4.0,I gave 4 stars because I later found the same watch for under $60 Otherwise it is a very good watch.
4.0,"Awesome product, looks hot on my girlfriend who loves earrings. Didn't appreciate the deliver cost though as that's where they make profit from a low cost item."
4.0,"I like the print, the material is a little thin, I got the white dress so it's a little see through, but fixed it up with a tank top and it looks great. overall a great dress."
4.0,The suit was ok but the one I received was not the same as in the picture so I had to return it
4.0,I am very happy with this wallet. I was looking for something compact and would also hold all my cards. This wallet is the best of both worlds! The color is beautiful and the leather is soft.
4.0,"Thia dress fits me very well I'm 5'6&#34;, 165 lbs, and pregnant. The fabric feels kind of cheap, but the overall look and comfort is nice. The top is a jersey fabric and has a lot of give. I may add a little stich to keep the top from opening too much!"
4.0,"I like the colors of it a lot. I'm over 40 (eh hem!) and my arms aren't as firm as they used to be. So in the arms, this fits a little too close for my comfort and is not loose like I imagined.  The rest of it is nice, and hits past the hips which is nice (camouflage!). I would probably order again, but maybe one size up, especially since it's intended for layering."
4.0,This shirt is cute for the price . i like the silver  pocket ! I usually wear a medium in US I order the extra large and it fit good
4.0,For the husker who has everything big red!
4.0,Looks like pictured.  Fits true to size.  Material falls nicely!
4.0,"The color is a true red,love the color"
4.0,Makes my tits look much bigger..
4.0,About this for my man loves the niners typical case nothing have I but seems like it will protect it if dropped
4.0,"Reading the previous reviews, it is obvious there are at least 3 different products that were received. The 2012 reviews say that there are zippers and a button. In 2013, there are no zippers or button. The one that I received has no zippers or a button and the paws look a bit different than the photo here.. It is not as fancy as the expensive SpiritHood but is a great deal for under $20."
4.0,The pattern is exactly as pictured and looks awesome... my only real complaint is that the material is a shiny spandex material which looks a little weird when the light hits it otherwise good shirt!
4.0,I was hoping that this would be stitched on not like an iron on screen print. The hat itself was good. Overall looked good and fit good.
4.0,"Very happy with this product.  I was concerned that it would be a little too long, but the length is fine."
4.0,Fits well for my Tragus piercing. The backs are hard to get on and just fall off so I don't use the backs.
4.0,These are great shorts they don't ride down when you run and they are a good weight but they were a bit small. I am 5'6&#34; tall and weigh 170 lbs I normally wear a Med in compression shorts but I read the reviews and decided to go with a large. they fit but are very snug. I would suggest going a size larger if you are wearing them for running!
4.0,Sharpens daytime view. Doesn‚Äôt really do much for me at night
4.0,These were exactly what I needed. The price was great and I was able to pierce my nipples and my navel using these forceps. Perfect for the job.
4.0,"I liked this dress for my daughter. Was just too long for my liking. It came to my daughter‚Äôs ankles. But it‚Äôs a very cute dress, fits well and bright/vibrant colors."
4.0,Great jacket! Fits my needs perfectly
4.0,My order was shipped quickly and was exactly what I wanted. The shirt fit just right and the accessories were a plus!
4.0,"Firstly, these are beautiful earrings. They're very shiny, and look quite sturdy. That said, I found a few issues with mine.<br /><br />They're much thicker than I anticipated. The gauge size of the clasp part is a bit too thick to comfortably use in my helix (upper ear cartilage) piecing, even though I often use 18g earrings. And the ones advertised as 8mm definitely seem larger (both thicker, and wider in diameter) than my old 10mm ones, which is odd.<br /><br />The clasp didn't close very firmly on some of them upon arrival, but I was able to fix that easily with some needlenose pliers. I'll update this review if I experience any other problems."
4.0,"Cute. My daughter wanted to look like one of these ""guys"" so it was perfect...except for the ""ears"" at the top. Not sure what thats about."
4.0,My son really enjoyed his gift. It pulled his casual look together! Very Cool looking.
4.0,"This is just about the opposite of a Tag or a Rolex. It is a very basic, plastic wristwatch. Cheap but functional. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but the two I bought appear to work accurately. They arrived on time as expected."
4.0,"Super cute.. A little on the flimsy side then some others I've ordered, but will do well for kids to do necklaces with..."
4.0,"It‚Äôs kind of a ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù shirt. The material is loud - like a paper bag. Definitely not soft. My son wore it a few times. He‚Äôs in between a small and medium in dress shirts and I opted for the small since I didn‚Äôt want it to appear big or baggy. But it only worked for about 2 washes. It‚Äôs a wild print, so I don‚Äôt know what he could wear it again for anyway."
4.0,The bread box was fairly easy to assemble. But I thought there was some sort of glass or clear plastic just behind the medal webbing & rooster like it sort of shows in the picture. Also the back of the box wasn't made of solid wood but was a hard cardboard.
4.0,Overall like the shoe. The zipper slightly cuts into the back of  my ankle.
4.0,Fit and fabric softness was very nice.  Each the tee-shirt became loose around collar after 3-4 washes.<br />Price was right but quality is disappointing.
4.0,Bought it for my Moto 360 2nd gen and it's been working great and looks really good and sporty with my silver 46mm model. Just what I was looking for!! The buckle could be improved thous since it is little cheap feeling and loose.
4.0,"Cute gold plated earrings. So far, I have not had any allergic reaction like I usually do to jewelery that isn‚Äôt gold or silver, but I have only been wearing these for about a week. The posts are normal length (not baby size) and would fit an adult fine."
4.0,I gave this to my granddaughter...she loves it.
4.0,The shoe was a little short for me. I do not like the high back of the shoe and high shoe tongue. For me personally these two things make it more involved for me getting into the shoe than I prefer. Now I know that.
4.0,Everyday use. Good quality.
4.0,"Nice comfy socks, not meant for a manual  work day."
4.0,"My husband always wears this type of boxer brief, even in the hot Arizona summer, and the ones he has been buying are pretty expensive.  There is no current price listing for these, but as a lesser known  brand, I would expect them to be a better value.<br /><br />The fabric of these is lighter than his other ones, and that is a good thing here.  The elastic is more comfortable for him, too.  Overall, he really likes these.  There is no fly opening, but he never uses that anyway, even on his that have the opening.<br /><br />Once these are available again, you'll have to comparison shop, but if they are reasonably priced, I'd certainly get them for him again."
4.0,Loved this suit.  Covered well and fit great.
4.0,It turned out really nice.
4.0,Fits great but I didn't care for the buttons. I changed them and it looks great.
4.0,"Flattering, great for larger busts and curves but runs small! Size 12/14 38DD sometimes DDD and 5‚Äô6‚Äù falls mid calf. Very accurately pictured"
4.0,fits small.  Takes a while to get here
4.0,"Looks like in the photo and really warm, perfect wear at office and obviously gently hand wash because of rhinestones."
4.0,"It is certainly cheaply made, but I couldn't reasonably expect any better given the price. The thong is not very stretchy and kind of hard to get past the hips, but once on it fits fine (normally wear 6 or 7). I could certainly see the top being too small, but as a male it fits perfectly, and there's definitely a good deal of wiggle room given the tie-on back. It comes with the two &#34;garters,&#34; the thong, the top, and even the hair ornament, and everything is as pictured. The lace part of my hair ornament detached from the hair pin part easily, but that won't be hard to fix. Overall it is a beautiful set, absolutely perfect for any traps out there ;P"
4.0,Cute shades but were slightly big for my face.
4.0,Very happy with the product although I don't know why I expected the pants to be above the knee and slightly longer than the shorts version. Instead it's a full length bottom. The color and texture is spot on and the coverage is good. If anything you can see a bit of the underwear lining but it's not too noticeable.
4.0,"Cute, lightweight pj‚Äôs. Nice for around the house or going to the mailbox. The green color is rich and washed well."
4.0,"First off, these eyeglass chains were just fine.  All of the problem lay with me.  My hair is too long and curly, and the cord kept getting tangled.  I didn't mind looking like a grandma, but I couldn't get used to the whole system.  I will probably go back to just placing my glasses down and losing them.  Dang it."
4.0,Got these for Mum woohoo has AMD. She says that they do help reduce the glare that bothers her so much. I'm not crazy about how noticeable the ring is but they're so much more stylish than blue blockers. Lol Very affordable.
4.0,"Cool.faces, not.much for customization"
4.0,"I have a friend that has a similar pair,the suede ones, he just got in and I tried them on before I ordered. We both wear about the same size and I knew a U.S. size 11would be too big. Also I was told these like any other leather shoe have a break in period before one wants to wear them all day and they are really comfortable. They do seem to be a little looser in the heel than the pair my friend has but once broke in they should be good. I hope! We'll see. I'll give them 41/2 stars for now. I don't know how to get a half star on this thing. This is my first pair but I have two friends that swear by these shoes so I got high hopes after break-in time. They both told me they will be tite at first and I'm sure the elastic in the side will stretch some also. I am cursed with a narrow heel but the looseness is tolerable."
4.0,I wear a size small US and this fit perfectly
4.0,I like it a lot.  I just wish the handles were longer so I could put it on my shoulder.
4.0,"I bought this as a secondary bag for a trip to Japan. Just based on the photo (not really looking at the specs of the bag), I thought this bag was large. Once I received it, it was smaller than I thought. The material of the bag isn't the best, it's very thin and lightweight. For the price of the bag, it's worth getting to have in case. When not in use, you can collapse it to be in a smaller package. This was helpful for our trip because I packed it first and then we used it to bring back souvenirs. Don't expect this bag to carry anything extremely heavy. This is actually a pretty good gym bag or a bag to keep in the car. I wouldn't use this as your main luggage for a long trip. This is good if you're doing a one or two day trip somewhere."
4.0,"Nice print, a little shorter than expected but fits fine. Material is soft and wrinkle resistant."
4.0,"Product looks nice but stones fell out...I need to use super glue... Lol my chakra must be way off haha no biggie...<br />Update: I bought another one an stones didn't fall out but I superglue anyways, compared to other ones I purchased after this one, I realized this one had the most compliments and was stones are real compared to others."
4.0,It was a bit small but wasn't uncomfortable. no wires poking. Held everything in place
4.0,Love the material! The sizing was way off. I'm a small and ordered a small but the shirt fit like a medium/large. Shipping took a bit of time.
4.0,"This is a terrific tank. The orange is bright and cheery. The material is soft, stretchy and moisture wicking. It fits nicely without being clingy. It is comfortable and will be fun to wear in warmer weather."
4.0,This bag is great for those who travel and have many many toiletries to bring along. It has lots of useful pockets and loops for things and more mesh than you could shake a stick at. Mine wasn't the prettiest on the inside. It had a number of threads just stuck around inside it and hanging out of seams. This doesn't really bother me since I'm using it for soaps and tooth brushes but to others it may be a point worth noting. Overall not bad.
4.0,"This classic black band does not fit my zen watch.  There are different size bands. Make sure to measure your watch.  Other than that, it seems built well."
4.0,I like this beanie alot escpicially that its reversable! It's good in drizzle and warm. My one complaint is that if you have it over your ears it is loud when you are moving your head. I rolled it up a bit so it would not cover my ears and it worked well. Overall would recommend.
4.0,Take a larger size
4.0,Product says 2xl but it actually fit like one size smaller
4.0,"Bought this necklace for my mom for Christmas and she loved it! Its such a simple but pretty necklace! This necklace is medium length, the chain feels sturdy."
4.0,The pearls are pretty and over all a nice piece.
4.0,This dress is  true to product measurements it was the child I was buying for who was too small. I should have measured the child first. on the upside she will have a lovely dress for this Christmas! I will get her a hoop skirt to help out this dress has a full skirt and a hoop will make it a whole new dress. the one thing I did.not like was when it was packed the bottom bow was folded and creased. I hope steam will take it out. and it did not arrive when they said but I did not think it would arrive on Good Friday. that is the reason for 4 stars not 5.
4.0,"I love that they stick to the way it's designed in the Handmaid's Tale show. The only thing that is off a little is the arm openings. You will have to cut and restitch them on the upper part if you want a good range of motion while wearing it, especially if you plan on holding a protest sign with it. Good materials, good stitching. I definitely recommend!"
4.0,It came in just as expected I'm like it very much except for it being transparent in the bottom area
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but I bought in the caramel color, and I wish I had chosen differently...other than that, it fits, it‚Äôs comfortable, it‚Äôs warm and it‚Äôs lined.  Waiting to see how it holds up to the washer, on gentle, of course...."
4.0,"I gave them to my mother because I listened to the reviews. I should not have sized down. Otherwise, I loved the color."
4.0,"LOVE the look and exterior of this purse; the inside leaves much to be desired, cheap lining and lack of interior pockets."
4.0,Love it but the turquoise fell out. I glued it back and it fell off again and I lost it.
4.0,Way too small. I ordered the same size but in a different color from a pair I already bought that fit great. And the ones fit my 12 year old sister. Not happy
4.0,"Very cute and super soft material! Definitely runs small, order one or two sizes up for lounge fit."
4.0,Fits great. Material is more polyester than cotton. The picture makes it appear more like a cotton. Overall the look is very flattering. Not sure how the material will feel in the hot weather.
4.0,It is so comfortable I live in it
4.0,Great but way too big. Could fit a 1-2 year old.
4.0,I bought these for my husband to wear around the house instead of street shoes. He had never owned slippers so I wasn't sure he'd like them but since they don't look like slippers there was no objection. You could probably wear them out of the house and no one would know. He has a pretty wide foot but they still fit. There was nice padding inside and seem well constructed for the price.
4.0,They came on time & were packaged very well. The quality of the wings are good & the straps are well secured. Very nice
4.0,Perfect for golfing in the AZ sun!
4.0,its alittle tight on my arm where the seem goes across on the sleeve right under the opening.
4.0,"I really do love the lightweight feel of these leggings, it‚Äôs like a second skin! The marl grey I got are definitely squat proof and not too tight. There‚Äôs a tiny bit of camel toe, but not too terrible. These make your bum look amazing! I can‚Äôt speak to longevity as I‚Äôve only worn them once, but I did do a good workout in them and they held up just fine! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 166 pounds and the large fit perfectly."
4.0,"I received this quite promptly in 8 days, which was sooner than expected since it came all the way from China.  It's very pretty and fits well, and I like that it has an adjustable length.  There was a small thread hanging when I opened it and it was a bit crimped from the packaging, but I will fix it easy enough with scissors and a brief ironing.  I ordered the matching bracelet with it and they go very pleasantly together.  Very affordable price for a little something extra to wear to my friend's gothic wedding.  I'm very pleased with this product!"
4.0,I have a dog with separation anxiety and I tried to use these to keep him in the kennel and he broke them all.  Probably needed to invest in stronger ones
4.0,"You have to be gentle with them they rip easy, other than that I love them."
4.0,Very comfortable but does stretch out a bit in the shoulders if worn all day
4.0,Fit good and is comfortable.
4.0,Me quedo un poco grande pero me gust√≥ mucho
4.0,I ·í™IKE IT ·ñ¥O·ñá ·ó∞Y ·ó∑·ó©·ó∑Y GI·ñá·í™ üòç
4.0,Good quality with good price. Mafe a nice gift for older teen girl.
4.0,"For five dollars, could not ask for more. That said, the fabric is a bit scratchy but nothing I'd fret about. I tailored each shirt to fit (so easy, check out you tube). I hope the kids didn't suffer too much sewing these (joking/not joking). Did I mention they are cheap???"
4.0,"This is a cute hat. As pictured, the bill comes already somewhat shaped. The LED switch is on the right inside and the battery pack on the left. The switch seems bulky, but I didn't feel it while wearing the hat. The wiring is accessible and is longer than needed. A loop of it sticks up from in the inside of the rim - mind any hair clips. I got the multicolored version. The modes seem to be: rapid flash, slower flash, pulse then flash, and off. The hat cycles through in that order with repeated presses of the side button. There's no just on function, which is somewhat disappointing. My daughter says she can wear it when she walks the dog, since the dog wears a light up collar at night!"
4.0,A little larger than expected but still very cute my daughter loves them!
4.0,"I really liked this belt for the first two months, then the leather completely fell apart near the buckle and it's useless now.<br /><br />May 31st update: I contacted the company and they sent me a new one, so I really appreciate the good customer service. The second belt is holding up well so far, but I won‚Äôt be confident until it‚Äôs been s few months. The new belt has this odd floating loop with leather strings on the back that I find pretty irritating. The last version didn‚Äôt have this."
4.0,Like the option to get more than one kind
4.0,Nice shoes but the laces with unravel on the ends causing a flowering effect
4.0,Just as picture. The earrings came with a cute little pouch to secure it. Great product overall
4.0,"I like wearing night gowns like this all year round. I'm in my early 50's and gowns like this don't make me too warm at night. The material is soft, though I have had softer blends. The length hits me just above me knees. The lace detail is nice and doesn't feel scratchy. I ordered a dark grey color so it's not see through. I like it!"
4.0,I love it ...it holds up and is really pretty.
4.0,"The dress is pretty. The fabric isn‚Äôt as nice as I had hoped, and it‚Äôs tiring to always have to get dresses altered. Just cause my bust is large doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm 6 ft tall. The dress i ordered fit fairly well in the bust, but it came down almost to my ankles."
4.0,This bra is comfy but a bit on the large side. It does not itch and actually provides a layer of warmth in the winter. I will evaluate how it feels in the summer. I bought 2 more and they should hold up for a long while as they are well made.<br /><br />Adding this in August‚Ä¶.Not for summer.
4.0,"Appropriatly sized for my face, I like the fit and over all look happy I purchased it. 1 2 3"
4.0,"Bigger than I thought, but sassy."
4.0,"I bought new socks, received new socks."
4.0,"Got a size 9 which I normally wear but it's a little bigger than expected.<br /><br />Other than that, keeps my feet warm for those long winter walks with the dog."
4.0,slippery!
4.0,"Beautiful...a little big, had to have 3 links removed."
4.0,An excellent rain repellent. Comfortable and light.
4.0,I love this dress but it's just that the front crisscross doesn't fit comfortably over my small B size boobs. I would recommend getting double sided tape to avoid any mishaps.
4.0,Cute but really big!
4.0,"Nice, but order a size larger than you think."
4.0,"I bought two of these (one for me  one for a friend) and they look great! They have a good, substantial weight. The cord is a little torqued from being wrapped up in the package, but it should straighten out in a while. It's a little short, however, even with the extender. Not something you can fit over your head. The clasp on mine is a little stiff and brittle. So far it's holding up and I'm happy!"
4.0,"This is a good quality top that can be worn alone or layered, and it will go with a lot of things. A couple of caveats, though: it‚Äôs pretty sheer, so I‚Äôd recommend wearing a black bra under it. And it runs a bit small, so if you like your tops roomy, I suggest ordering a size up from your usual."
4.0,The fabric draped well very soft
4.0,Good control on tummy. Has boning which I was surprised by because you can't really tell from the image. One con is that the lace around the thigh rolls up when you sit.
4.0,Love the look of of the mug. My only complaint is that my coffee loses heat a bit faster than in other mugs...
4.0,They look fine to me I like small ear rings big ones look super fake and goofy. Happy with my buy.
4.0,There are lots of slots to hold credit cards inside and a wide zippered pocked for loose change or in that pocket I‚Äôll put my earbuds and lipgloss in it. The exterior pocket holds my iPhone XR securely. The only downfall to the purse is when I use the shoulder strap the grommets to hold the strap are lower on the purse and I‚Äôll find the purse hanging upside down sometimes.
4.0,"Good quality, my daughter loves it!"
4.0,"Look great, but cuff can hurt after wearing them awhile. I usually have to remove them after wearing them for 4 hours"
4.0,Cute. Great gift for young troll lover. A little bulky.
4.0,Color is easy to see and makes it easier to locate your bags.
4.0,"The fit is great.  The spelling, not so great.  ‚ÄòSicrra Nevada mounlalns National Paris‚Äô??  Really?<br /><br />My daughter is forcing me to give a 4 star review just because of the epic misspelling."
4.0,Pretty cool but I thought it was bigger.
4.0,It‚Äôs nice. From the pictures it seems that it it‚Äôs like a real looking paper bill with gold highlights. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs all gold.  Nice protective envelope that opens to remove stickers...hard to see/find. -It arrived very fast and packed very well as to not get damaged.
4.0,"Going to start off by saying that I LOVE these earrings! I bought them in gold and they arrived quicker than the estimated time, and I've had them for about two months with minimal problems. The reason they got 4 stars is the backings they use. They broke in half yesterday when I woke up. I've kept these in the whole time I've had them (looking for other pairs that I want atm, hahaha) and have had no discoloration issues at all!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these!"
4.0,My sister really enjoyed getting them
4.0,"Nice clear bag, strap is perfect, it can be used as crossbody bag. My only issue is that it could be a little larger."
4.0,"Perfect for a summer BBQ or even the office. Can be dressed up or down. Fabric is soft, but not too tight or too stretchy. Great length on the sleeves and the length of the entire dress is flattering. I ordered a size large and I'm 5' 11&#34; and my measurements are 36-26-46"
4.0,For the price these are pretty nice sunglasses and I use them all the time.
4.0,They are very strong.  Very good support on wrist.  Love them.
4.0,Really pretty but very thin.
4.0,"My wife really loved the dress and pattern. Sadly, it just didn't fit her as she wanted. She's curvy and it really accentuated her bottom, which I liked, but she didn't :)"
4.0,"the bag is well constructed and the exterior seems well configured for any abuse. The strap is strong, breathable and can be easily extended. The buckle helps in wearing the bag over shoulder in any configuration. The interior is soft to touch and is roomy. Its bigger and hold more items like an ipad than a fanny pack and the front pouch can hold essential documents. The mesh bag can hold a water bottle. So I would consider it an essential tool for any traveller.<br />I would have liked a larger opening and it can be done by moving the meshed pouch to other side of the bag."
4.0,This hat has a very low crown.
4.0,"Material is weird...hard, papery, thin, kinda itchy looking feeling but it wasn't bothersome, just weird. Drawstring is super long and top hip part nice and thick. I ordered medium, I'm 5'5 163lbs and they weren't tight like I like them. The mediums were kind of baggy but fit ok and so I'm returning for a smaller pair."
4.0,Very Comfortable! A bit small around the waist but overall good quality!
4.0,"worth the price !! These glasses are totally worth the price listed. These are fashionable, trendy and are made with good quality material which is durable enough. Got it for my next Florida trip and I think this will completely rock my looks. Looks photogenic in pics while wearing them. Comes with nice black draw string pouch which is good for storage when glasses not in use plus also protects your glasses from scratches when in your bag or you can use it to gift some one as it. Overall happy with my purchase and will continue using it. Received for free or at discounted price for a fair and unbiased opinion. All statements made are my own and are honest. Thanks for reading !"
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 110lbs and ordered a small. It's kinda big on me and kinda too low, granted I'm around a small b cup but I just wear the shirt backwards and it's chill."
4.0,The quality was nice just didn‚Äôt care for the colors after I got them.  Will wear them anyway.
4.0,"Very reasonably priced, however, my black one eventually tore. These were cheap enough to reorder again though. I wish they offered black, blue and white verse gray, but overall a good purchase."
4.0,"Although this blouse is very pretty, it is way too small. My mom always wears a medium but reviews stated it ran too small so I ordered a large. It was still too small. If you're a medium in U.S. Better size it UP to a 3x"
4.0,"Seem very cheap, not sure if they will hold up. A lot of bags come with this order."
4.0,Product is as it appears.. velvet generic cloak.
4.0,"Very soft, faded a bit after it was washed."
4.0,Nice embroidery work and quality looks good
4.0,It is comfortable and stays in place.<br />I'm short and plump. It is too long for me but I haven't clipped it shorter. I didn't want to lose the pretty lace edge.
4.0,"This fits my 9 year old grandson like it should, not to thick easy for him to breathe through. He used it to play cops and robbers with. I also like the stars and bars design. The only thing I didn't like was the silky fabric, which tends to snag easy."
4.0,Used the glasses as part of my costume of Maxine. It was perfect.
4.0,This will be a lovely spring dress.
4.0,"So happy to wear this today! It‚Äôs pretty and simple,<br />Excellent length. Chain feels cheap but it‚Äôs what I would expect at this price point. Also there was a sharpish spot on the feather itself that snagged my shirt, but I was able to smooth it. Would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
4.0,"A bit &#34;blousy&#34; but very nice shirt. Longer than necessary in the sleeves, but I don't mind that much. Very cool..."
4.0,Matte finish looks nice.
4.0,"My boy was thrilled about his watch! It was a tad complicated to program, but we figured it out."
4.0,The shirt is nice material are ok I order xs I always wear s-xs but still was big for me not as tight as I want
4.0,"Vert pretty, the fabric is a bit stiff."
4.0,"My son is in a 3t currently, so I ordered 4t in order for him to be able to wear it for a while longer, but it just fit."
4.0,"Not a push up top, but very cute! The bottom was smaller than I thought. Got here on time."
4.0,"These shoes are ideal for traveling because they are easy to remove going through security and they are also easy to slip on and off while you're on the airplane.  I also have kept these in my office drawer so during lunch I can put them on and walk to get lunch in our tunnel system, rather than having to wear my heels. I can move a lot faster in these and get a mini power walk in."
4.0,I received the black fishnet ankle socks to wear with my edgy boots.  They are a bit on the small size. I wear a size 6.5-7 size shoe.  I ruined the first pair by pulling on them too hard and ripped the sock to shreds.
4.0,"I love this dress! It‚Äôs super cute. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt wear it right now because it‚Äôs so high at the neck it‚Äôs uncomfortable - it feels like I‚Äôm choking. I do love the style and the rest of the dress so much I‚Äôm planning on getting it altered.<br /><br />Rated 4/5 because I love it so much I‚Äôm planning on paying more than I paid initially to make it right."
4.0,Had to send it back because the straps are too short on the shoulders.
4.0,nice and cute!
4.0,"It is a very cute bracelet, but very hard to clasp but oneself. It is exactly as pictured, but very slow receiving"
4.0,Good Bag.  Shoulder Strap should be detachable. Fare buy for the money.
4.0,"Nice shirt, decent price available on Amazon, I usually wear an S but get these shirts in M as they do tend to shrink a bit in the wash, this is not standard across their brand however, so far after several washes no evidence of wear/tear and the design is still intact, would recommend!"
4.0,"The top is beautiful.  But it does fit a little smaller than I expected.  Not too bad though.  The sleeves are see through, I must not have noticed in the stock photo.  I wish the sleeves were a little bit longer.  Overall, I was surprised by it.  It is hard to find clothes that I like that fit correctly"
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful and the length is adjustable from about 16 inches to 20 inches in length. The earrings were too gaudy for me; I feel like they detracted from the necklace. Be warned that if you pull on parts of the jewelry, it will come apart. I was able to pull the earrings down to the center piece with little effort."
4.0,"Some misconceptions about these pants. In the photo it looks like rayon fabric and a little see through. However, it‚Äôs a cotton blend and the polka dots are much bigger than they appear. It did fit nicely and looked cute; it just wasn‚Äôt for me."
4.0,These earrings look exactly as pictured on the product page.  They are beaded with tiny black and white beads and would be great to wear with any outfit.  These could be worn to casual and fancier events or just to the office or shopping.  I like them pretty well.  They aren't heavy and won't pull your earlobes down.
4.0,"This is a unique piece. I am impressed by the quality and the low price. The watch face is a good size. It's not jumbo, but I would say above average size. The only reason this is not 5 star is because it's not water resistant/proof. I'm not complaining, however, because of the price. I have gotten several compliments from wearing this."
4.0,"I love these. I will get a size larger next time because being cotton, they do shrink a bit.  I like them loose. I have two pair already!"
4.0,"Very nice and good material, a little bigger than expected but still ok for the office."
4.0,"These masks were recommended by a friend. They‚Äôre soft and fit well. I took off a star because even picking up one mask gently by the ear loop broke it, and it‚Äôs only the third one I‚Äôve used so far."
4.0,"I bought this one and the same thing in a different color scheme for my elderly mom.  Neither lasted a whole year, but I will still probably buy one again because she needs one with a large, easy to read face, and these are attractive and not bulky, and the price is right."
4.0,I am 5'3 and 175lb I order a xl and it's a bit loose but then again I like my clothes tight so it might be perfect for someone who doesn't like tight fitted clothes
4.0,These jhumka earrings look very pretty on my ears.<br />It goes well red dresses and makes the look prominent.<br />It is a casual earrings set that is good to wear for everyday use for work or for shopping.<br />I feel the price of 12.90$ is reasonable for this set.
4.0,Unfortunately my T-shirt got ruined when it was put in the dryer by mistake. You must hang dry. But I really liked the fit and material. May buy another.
4.0,I purchased this dress in February for my bridal shower on April 13th. I did realize until that day that the split was not stitched properly. The stitching was actually coming apart. That is the only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4stars and not 5. I‚Äôm sure had I noticed when it was 1st purchased that I could have exchanged. The dress fit great. It‚Äôs comfortable and stretchy.  I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô3‚Äù 200lbs. I ordered an XL probably could have purchased a Large. The top fit loose so I had to pin it. No one could see where it was coming apart at the split and it didn‚Äôt rip any further throughout the bridal shower. I received so many compliments and people were surprised when I told them where i purchased it. Overall I‚Äôm satisfied. Hope this helps
4.0,"They cling a little TOO close around the pelvis area, if you catch my drift. Maybe in black it wouldn't be so obvious, but in the heather I don't feel comfortable wearing them out of the house without a long sweater. Super comfortable though, and after I trimmed the legs to the right length I had enough material to make four headbands."
4.0,The fit of the legs . Appears to be light and movable.  Need yo wear for a longer period of time to be certain  but nice.
4.0,"Can‚Äôt beat the price. Tends to get stuck on some fabric when zipped, but overall I would recommend this item."
4.0,"Fits a little smaller than I expected, but overall it's nice."
4.0,"The first pair I bought had to be returned because after wearing for just a few days the toes were dented. The second pair seem ok so far. Took a star off because they feel like the shape support inside is made of something cheap like cardboard (which would explain the dents) but they look cute, probably won‚Äôt last more than one season though."
4.0,"These bracelets are really nice, I got them for special gifts and everyone was very happy with tjem"
4.0,I love it!! So darling! Smaller than in the photo though or it would get 5 stars.
4.0,"i am 6ft, 290, 52/54 coat size, and 18.5 neck, i bought the 5xl and it fits like a 3xl!!!!<br /> perfect with a mock turtleneck or a thick t-shirt underneath"
4.0,"My 6 year old is obsessed with little mermaid, so she wears these as pants. They're a big baggy, but they fit her waist. She loves them."
4.0,Fabric is extremely thin but still a cute dress for price paid. I originally ordered a size XL in same dress but different print and and I sized down to a L for this one
4.0,The romper was super cute and good quality. I ordered a small for my youngest daughter and it was way too big. She was very disappointed. Luckily I have 4 daughters and it did fit one of them. This daughter normally wears a medium or large and wears a 34 D bra. Don't buy this if you are a small petite girl.
4.0,"Nice looking, nice fitting, but zipper is on the wrong side like for a lady's coat. Wouldn't have bought it if I had known."
4.0,"I use this for running in cold weather.  It does exactly what it should do.  The only drawback I have found is that the neck should be longer.  Besides that, I love it."
4.0,I love this dress. Just wish the pockets were a little lower.
4.0,"These are really cute, but were too big for my 8-week-old's head.  Look forward to seeing her in them in a couple of months."
4.0,"Item was the right fit. I have been using the type of posture support made with straps and velcro prior to this. However the straps would roll and then cut into my underarm. Although the shirt did not do this, it did not have the same support as the strappy one so was not as effective"
4.0,"My wife doesn't wear a lot of shorts but likes to bop around the house in them. These work for that. They are a little on the long side but are soft, comfortable, and machine washable. Pretty good."
4.0,easy to use feels good
4.0,"Very well made bag and will hold  many products! I would buy this product again, but it is expensive. I suppose you pay for quality!"
4.0,Needs pockets
4.0,A little on the big side but great product overall.
4.0,The color. It looks more like gold than yellow.
4.0,These are adorable socks and I wish my daughter could've worn them a bit longer.  She's a size 6 1/2 women's and they were rather tight.
4.0,Love it but fits weird
4.0,Joe's worked very well with my exchange.Very cozy compared to my Staff hoodie. Customer service is top notch.
4.0,"Overall the frame is a good product! However, the frame is not fitted for prescription lenses. I strongly believe that if manufacturer were able to remove the kinks, and improve on the design, these frames would be selling like hot cakes. Rims on the frame need to be wider in order to install prescription lenses. Another suggestion would be the fallowing: To have the rims open in such way that the prescriptions lenses could be installed and secured with a screw on top of the frames. These frames have the pop-up system that would cause the lenses to pop right out. Two minor defects that can be easy to fix. Once this is done. the product will be rated 10 stars out of five."
4.0,I was a little skeptical about getting lenses online but I love these lenses! They are crystal clear. I love the mirrored lenses that are also polarized. I have to say that they were very Dufficult to get into the glasses. At first I wasn't sure they would fit and had to put the original lenses back in but I tried again with the new lenses. I almost thought I was going to break them but once I got them it in they fit perfect and look incredible!
4.0,The fit on this tank is great. It's a thicker fabric but is breathable at the same time. Sizing is pretty true but it's stretchy too.
4.0,Very nice. My granddaughter loved them!
4.0,Nice but the chain was a little short.
4.0,I‚Äôm a NICU nurse so can‚Äôt wear anything on my fingers or wrists at work. I got this so I could have my Apple Watch on me at work. The product is exactly as described and works. I just found having my watch pinned to my scrubs wasn‚Äôt as practical/useful as I thought it would be. I ended up not using the product more than a couple of times.
4.0,If you have a butt it will definitely enhance it!
4.0,"I bought this pair to have for driving while my Italian leather is being cleaned. The fit (medium) was good, though a bit tight for the size. My only real complain was that the leather dye came off onto my hands after I had been wearing them for a while. It came off with soap and water, but annoying, and I don't know how toxic it was. Still, for the price, decent enough."
4.0,"Two of me could fit in this, but that is the style. I expected the roominess and comfort.  Love the wine color.  The fabric is heavier than I expected and really quite nice, feels luxurious for something in this price range.  It arrived on a day when we were in the 90s so I won't be wearing it until the temps cool down.  Although I was hoping for something to wear around the house now, I am really not complaining.  I am very happy with this Caftan.  I will not be embarrassed to be wearing it if friends drop by."
4.0,The fabric felt great. It was light weight and long enough to wear with leggings. I thought it ran big so I needed a size smaller than I normally wear. It would be a great travel shirt
4.0,Kinda pretty...it's okay .I guess..
4.0,"Decent pair of glasses, in my opinion, quality for the price is the reason for the rating."
4.0,"I love the outfit and I plan on still using it for newborn pictures but it is too large, I wasn't aware it was not newborn size."
4.0,I ordered a XL it was way too big but it‚Äôs supper comfy and I wear it a lot
4.0,A tad different than advertised. It had the regular spiral design as opposed to the star shaped pictured. Came with some complimentary accessories as well and was the extra large size.
4.0,Nice top but I wish it had lower pockets.  I'm constantly looking for pockets to put things in and the top pocket is not enough.
4.0,These look great.  Flashes of blue depending on the light. Very inexpensive but look like a million on your shirt.
4.0,"Super cute top! It‚Äôs slightly on the smaller side, but it‚Äôs really stretchy. It‚Äôs a little see through, but you might not have this problem with a darker color since I had the gold. The sequins tend to get caught on each other between the arms and the body, so just something be aware of!"
4.0,Great shirt but runs a little small.
4.0,Love it got so many compliments
4.0,Used this for a costume event.  Nice look and pulled the costume together.  Light weight but doesn't look cheapie.
4.0,"Thought my daughter could use in swim practice. While it has pretty good compression, it was a little roomy around the bust and thighs compared with other size 2-4 items. Length was good so I‚Äôll try taking in"
4.0,"The text is slightly blurred, but still readable. Product quality is acceptable for the price point."
4.0,"Beautiful, great quality, only thing is I am very hot natured and the mask turned my face green....  it mad it wasn‚Äôt super expensive and I was very sweaty but just beware if you are hot natured to watch for it to turn your face green"
4.0,"I loved this dress so much. But I had to send it back and they didn't have my size after I did. I ordered according to the size chart, however the dress was a bit small. If I had kept it and washed it, it would have been wayy too small. I would suggest ordering a size larger. Wish I would have in the first place :("
4.0,"It is slightly larger than I imagined it would be... It is very well-made, and gained several compliments."
4.0,Nice shirt.. Be sure to use cold water for washing..
4.0,Bigger and a little more gold than I expected. Overall it was very cute.
4.0,"These are nice glasses, especially for the price. Lenses are clear of distortions and the frames seem well built. One caveat is that the only part of the frame that appears to be made from titanium is the bridge so these frames are not super lightweight."
4.0,Got this in the recommendation of my plastic surgeon. I like it. It works to open up my new belt button
4.0,"These socks fulfill their purpose well. If you have slippery floors, they certainly are very helpful. I only wish they were just a little ticker than they are, but it is certainly not a deal breaker."
4.0,no problems with it.. arrived in good condition.. yaay
4.0,"Read the reviews so I ordered 1 size up, but it was still tight in the chest and hips. No biggy, great material, lightweight. I can see why they get good reviews. Will buy again."
4.0,Very cute little earrings. Wish they were just a little larger.
4.0,"Size run small , I ordered my normal size and its tight on the last hooks , they did include an extender, which I haven't tried yet but I think it will fix the problem  . This bra did give this small B cup a lot of lift and pushes the girls together better then any bra Ive owned . Would give five stars if it wasn't as tight . The band below the cups is thick and comfortable and stops the girls from slipping down when you move around (most bras they start off up and together then ten minutes later , I have no cleavage and the bra is then useless for what I wanted (even if I crossed the strapes which is so uncomfortable. This bra they stay where you put them and its lot more comfortable then using my normal push up bras and having the shorten and cross the strapes. Good Buy in my opinion"
4.0,"Great product, especially for the price. Looks exactly like the picture and fit true to size. The only reason I did not give this 5 Stars is because the fabric is a noticeably sheer/see through so unless you are wearing it over a bathing suit on a beach, you should wear a slip or tank and boy shorts to prevent everyone from seeing your goods."
4.0,Buttons are big. The cost was reasonable. I like the bracelet type wristband.
4.0,I really like outfit.  It runs a little small but it is very comfortable.  Color is vibrant.
4.0,It's  beautiful but a little big for me on the chest area
4.0,Haven‚Äôt tried it yet<br />Beautiful shoes
4.0,The're okay i guess..
4.0,"This is a great hat. And it's a hat. So I used it to wear on my head. They were smart to make it come with the inserts to adjust the fit. Because my hair varies from short to not so short.  My only complaint is that if you spend that much on a hat, it should come with a nice hat storage box. Not just a hat sized shipping box."
4.0,"It is a pretty necklace, looks elegant, color os bright, chain is nice, simple design, tiny initial letter, if you would like something like this characteristics go for it, only reason  I give 4 stars it is because it is very tiny, it looks more for a little girl than a woman."
4.0,Love it and comfy!  Material is a little thin but I ill just wear a tank under it.
4.0,This fits  me a little on the big side but that's fine! I ordered a size up just in case my arms are wide and butt is bigger than normal so I wanted to be on the safe side. In the bright side it's a little roomy for me to breathe in it!
4.0,"Pretty nice. Not as good as original laces that came with Keen boots, but not bad."
4.0,stayed beautiful for a long time.
4.0,Liked the fit and cut but way thin for white material. You can see the shadow of my belly button and the straps of my beige bra!
4.0,"This dress looks just like the one on the model. The fabric is thin but not completely see through. I purchased a size small. The dress is stretchy but for the sake of the design& thinness, I think it‚Äôs best to go for a perfect fit."
4.0,"I'm very happy with what I got, they came the way they said it would and look amazing and detailed. I only wish that the chains were longer, but that's just a person preference. Otherwise they are great and really beautiful."
4.0,Again another great purchase if you try loves Sesame Street Elmo or any of the guys these sucks Steve for them.  Putting shoes on isn't so much a task
4.0,Packaged very nicely for a gift. Much more dainty in person. Was hoping it would be larger but still a very nice set.
4.0,This glasses make me more can see when in drive at night
4.0,I ordered this shoe in a size 11...should have abided by my previous purchase of another Luchiny shoe  and bought the size 10.  This  manufacturer shoes fits true to size.  So I will take the blame for the shoe fitting a little large.  I fell in love with the pattern and color in hopes that a pair of shoe pads will help them to fit more snug on my feet.
4.0,"I like the dress; however, the front is a little longer than what is in the picture.  My daughter 5'4 and the front is long."
4.0,Really nice but completely not true on sizes
4.0,"This product doesn‚Äôt work for Anything bigger than a DD cup. If you‚Äôre comfortable with showing a little skin and not being well lifted, with it then you can wear it. It may work with a halter top or halter dress because it has a little bit left in the clothing"
4.0,"Super soft. I like the adjustable string that runs through the neck part, so I can decide if it is off the shoulder or not. The fabric is a bit thin though, so it would require something under it in the light color I purchased. Overall though, its quite cute."
4.0,great for workout but not to wear all day
4.0,"It was a gift for my son, its Beautiful! And he loved it very much! But the only wrong thing with it the chain is too small. I didnt realize it was on 20'. So now i have to purchase a chain for it. Too bad it doesnt come with a longer chain."
4.0,"Okay, I love the polarized lenses in the KKP Classic Round Polarized Sunglasses - which really clarify my view when driving - and are effective at blocking the sun's glare. I just don't like the modern design of the glasses, which look rather big on my face. I realize that's a personal choice.<br />  The the lenses and frames themselves are effective at doing what they are designed to do. The lenses are big enough that there isn't a lot of glare sneaking in from around the edges. The polarization helps you see more clearly, which I especially noticed during the last blizzard. I'm definitely keeping them in my car for safer driving!"
4.0,"Cute set, but the pants seemed a bit large, almost like baggy pajama pants. I simply paired the top with some tights."
4.0,They wear really well and help protect my eyes.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:940a354e215126a16009b68e050e96c0]] The product is made nicely. The grip holds my iPhone XR very tight and never feels like it will come loose during heavy game play. It has a metal stand so if you need to put the controller down it will still sit up instead of fall back. Fits the Xbox One controller perfectly. Great bang for your buck you get 3 of them so you can have a game session with you and your kids or buddies. With iOS 13 new update to add Bluetooth support for Xbox and PlayStation controllers this makes gaming on mobile so much easier. Lastly I gave this product 4 stars because the only issue is I wish there was a locking mechanism to hold the clip from moving forward. It‚Äôs good when Sitting in upright condition but if you want to lay down and play the phones weight will sometimes easily fall forward rarely but has happened. Would definitely buy this again.
4.0,These are adorable. I bought them for my three year old and I must have misunderstood the sizing. I kept them and will gift them to someone else because they are otherwise well made and super cute.
4.0,"Maybe a tad too hot for TX right now, but cute and extremely comfortable."
4.0,Love the dress. Exactly as shown. The bow on back was a little bit off....not in the middle as expected.
4.0,"I wore these to a rave with an arctic theme. They did the job and actually stood up pretty well to damage (I wore them outside). Survived a wash too, very happy given the price tag."
4.0,"This shirt tapers in slightly between chest and waist for what could be a bit of a fitted look. The generous sizing widthwise makes that hard to see, though.<br /><br />The size L I got measures:<br /><br />Shoulders: 20""<br />Chest: 46""<br />Waist: 44""<br />Length: 28""<br /><br />That's more like XL in the shoulders and chest, but the waist is within a normal large size range, maybe on the edge of XL. It's a little short lengthwise, made to wear out as shown in the photos.<br /><br />The material medium-thick, soft, smooth, feels substantial.<br /><br />Comes with a scratchy label at the back of the neck, and the stitching for it shows through. I fixed both issues with a thread ripper.<br /><br />The care tag says machine wash cold with similar colors, don't soak, no bleach, cool iron under dry cloth, dry clean OK. It shows the symbol for tumble dry low heat, but it says line dry. I plan to tumble dry. I usually remove tees when they're almost dry and lay them out on top of each other to finish. Works fine in arid Utah.<br /><br />Aiyino is a recent brand from China."
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable and very classy."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my bridal shower and I loved it! I got so many compliments on it and it was cool to say I got it from Amazon. I am a short girl, 5‚Äô3 140 lbs and I ordered a medium and it fit perfect! I will say it was a little see through, but under garments did just fine to help."
4.0,I love this dress. It seems to have a slight imperfection on the chest area but nothing I<br />Couldn‚Äôt have fixed. Maybe it was just the one I got. Anyway I fixed it and now it‚Äôs perfect! No<br />Biggie!
4.0,Great clutch. ordered a purple one also and the snap closure broke. Very nice bag though. Wish it hadn't broke. I have the black one but liked the purple more.
4.0,Great replacements for my ballet flats now that plantar facitis has taken over. Cushy insole but not a lot of arch support. They are removable though and will allow for my orthotics. They can be dressed up or dressed down. Very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"PRO:  Warm and look good<br />CON:  Too narrow for those with large calves, and size appears to be smaller."
4.0,very comfortable....
4.0,"I like this, it's really cute! Only complaint is I have a big chest and so it was a tad tight under my boob's... Other then that it fit as expected!"
4.0,"This is a sexy dress BUT I just didn‚Äôt like the fabric in the front.  Wasn‚Äôt to fond of how shiney it was.  The lace was really nice, I did like that."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 145lbs with a 36C and moderately wide hips. Initially, I purchased a medium based off reviews and the dress barely made it over my hips and was too tight for my liking. I returned it for the large and the large is much better for getting the dress on. You can see the contour of my hips how they taper out and it doesn‚Äôt look the best IMO, but I can live with that. The dress does tend to ride up fairly quick, so be mindful unless y‚Äôall want to give some free shows to strangers. Overall, I love the dress and I‚Äôm sure it will end up on the floor at the end of the night."
4.0,Really nice. Soft and warm
4.0,Wow! Its gorgeous. I am so happy with this dress! I am 5'6 150 and ordered a large. My jeans are typically a size 10. This is a touch small. But it looks amazing and the fabric is very nice. The skirt on the inside is pretty short but thats cool. Its very pretty!<br />The packaging it came in was very dirty and dusty. Left a film all over my hands. Luckily not on the black dress.<br />Thanks for a great buy. I recommend this one! (Buy a size up though)
4.0,Comfortable. I wear 32-34 DD and ordered a large because at times these sport bras come to small but medium would have been perfect. But large is good too.
4.0,"Me encanto, compre de varios colores"
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty but I really don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any silver in it. It‚Äôs way more shiny than a real silver bracelet I bought the same week. There‚Äôs no 925 stamp either. Works for Med/large wrists.
4.0,made a nice gift
4.0,It‚Äôs  cool and comfortable.
4.0,Exactly as described. I bought them for a gift. She was pleased with them.
4.0,Limited arm range but cute dress. Longer than expected but not too long
4.0,"Works as advertised, and soft material comfortable on neck.  However, a Residual chemical smell lingers on product."
4.0,Helps control moisture
4.0,"The material does not have a silky feeling, instead its has the fabric that is kind of scratchy chiffon . The size is pretty big and sometimes might be a little big for some people, so taking a size down might correct the size issue. The flowers on cardigan are pretty big and also bright at the same time. This cardigan can be thrown on some tank tops for some coverage or can also be worn on other types of tops."
4.0,"Love them! As pictured, fit perfectly! I gave them a 4 because the zipper is cheap! I hope it doesn‚Äôt break!"
4.0,"This top is superrrrr cute and looks just as pictured expect the length. It is a crop (which was fine since I bought it to wear under another top) however, it's even shorter than a standard crop if you have a bigger chest ofc. I am a size 36D and this top ends barely at the bottom of my cup when wearing a bra. If that's an issue for you I would suggest ordering a size up."
4.0,Nice shirt but the size runs a little on the small size<br /> So if you order I would order one size bigger than you would normally wear.
4.0,"Lightweight and flattering.  Size xs on 5'3"" 120lbs is a good fit"
4.0,"Can't beat this wallet, light good size plenty of pockets and windows (3). This is my second wallet after five years. This one was modified from from the previous from clear view vinyl windows to  mesh type pocket windows (I prefer the the former, clearer viewing)  In any case this is a great wallet for the value and functionality."
4.0,"Gift for my 13 yo daughter, thick good quality, fits well, she loves it!"
4.0,"It fits well, to my knees. It's warm and cozy and the pattern is fun. Easy to wash, keeps its shape. But if I want a winter, warm bathrobe, why the hell does it stop at the knees??? Yeah, I like looking cute, but it's a winter robe. I want to be warm!!!!! Also, my kids scream if I bend over without thinking. Better length would've rated 5 stars."
4.0,"Love the material of the shirt, but I would recommend ordering a size up if you don‚Äôt like your T-shirt ‚Äòclingy‚Äô"
4.0,"Gift. He liked it.<br />The pins(badges) themselves look very nice. 4/5, one short only because of the quake badge seeming a bit too brightly colored and the box had two smudge marks under the lid. Nothing major that would really distract unless you're crazy like us."
4.0,"I just received these earrings today, and they are very cute and a nice size (not super big, not too small).  They arrived within the estimated 1-2 week window."
4.0,Calidad aceptable
4.0,"Bottoms cut a little low for me.  Tummy tuck shows.  Took over a month to get it, order early."
4.0,"Cute, bigger than I thought. The tail is made out very hard plastic, not bendable or stretchy. Still cute though."
4.0,"fits well, i'm 5'10 and ordered a 14.  It's a cute dress, heavy fabric, for the price it's a good dress"
4.0,Vert versatile
4.0,Really love the shelf bra tank tops.<br />I wanted to reorder in a different color but they were not available.
4.0,I love the this lightweight dress.
4.0,Definitely a wallet for just your credit cards the zippered pocket can hole a few coins or a few folder dollar bills but they will reshape the wallet if there are to many in it... the leather is real... it has 8 slots and a zippered middle...
4.0,"We used these for a performance of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; and they worked well. They are fairly easy to bend and seem like they would break easily, though ours did survive the show. Overall we were pleased with them."
4.0,"I rated this piece a 4 out of 5 because I disagreed with the stated color. I would not call this color Champagne, color difference aside I love it. This piece is able to be worn as a scarf and or headwrap, it looks and works wonderfully either way. Follow directions relative to care for easy sustainable beauty hand-wash in cold water, and hang to dry..."
4.0,I ordered a medium and I like it but it adds a bit more bulk to my frame than I like.<br />But it's a very nice sweater.
4.0,"Very nice quality...Beautiful hair wig, beard and accessories. The jacket size could be a little larger."
4.0,"The Opal are small, but 10 beauties"
4.0,"This review is specifically for the sapphire blue long-sleeved dress, as I know other styles in this grouping are different. I wanted this dress to be a five star but on me it is a three so I am compromising on four stars for the quality. The linen is heavy and not see-through, even though the dress is lined. It is not light-weight so it won‚Äôt work as a summer dress wherever it is hot and humid.  It is a very well-made dress for someone who is taller. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and even after washing and drying on high heat it is still too overwhelming and long on me. The fabric is not gauzy, so a belt only emphasizes the extra bulkiness of the fabric. The sides have an extra panel that makes it balloon out; if the fabric were thinner with a closer drape to the body I don‚Äôt think it would be so noticeable. I am not sending it back because I don‚Äôt want to pay the postage to China, so it will become a house dress. I am turning into my mother-in-law!"
4.0,Nice necklace.....
4.0,They are a little small on my husband but they are stylish and he wont let me return so they must not be too bad. He likes the way they look and so do I. Hes a man of few words but he did say they were a little small and hoping once they are broken in that theyll be okay. He wears a 9.5 wide and I bought him a 10....
4.0,"I love coach though I Mayb changing my designer product likes soon but this works for me for now. I use it when Iam not driving to take my phone and credit card or license. I have another coach wrist bag that has multiple credit cards pockets inside this has only 2, that‚Äôs why I gave it 4 star . Overall it‚Äôs very classy looking and the gold looks more brass"
4.0,"I love the size of this passport case. Thin enough to fit easily in my jacket pocket even with a few cards in the credit card slots. I to not put currency in this case but if I did, it would definitely lose its &#34;thin&#34; profile. For the price paid, a very good passport case."
4.0,I am an average size man.  The band barely slips off when opened to the fullest.  The length could be a little longer.
4.0,"This thing is probably one of my most favorite hoodies that I own, and I own a LOT of hoodies! It is a black and white hoodie featuring astronaut cats. As in, cats in space, wearing astronaut stuff. I don‚Äôt think there can possibly be anything better than that.<br /><br />The hoodie fits true to size, and it made of a soft and smooth, almost silky fabric that is cool to the touch. It‚Äôs not the most comfortable fabric, as it‚Äôs a bit stiff, but it does allow for the image on the hoodie to be crystal clear and of perfect quality. The pocket is large and spacious, which is always a plus, and the hood fits easily over my head (even when my hair is up in a bun) with plenty of extra room.<br /><br />The hoodie is relatively inexpensive and it a fairly good value for money. It isn‚Äôt the highest quality, but it‚Äôs still pretty nice as far as hoodies go. It will keep you warm and comfortable, in any case. It would make a fun gift to cat lovers/astronaut enthusiasts! Because of the design, I absolutely recommend it."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my little niece to match my daughter for Christmas this year. I like that it has a cute large plaid pattern, it adds a sophisticated element while still being childlike in style with the sleeve, collar, and bow. I only wanted it to be longer by maybe 2 inches. It was still darling and she felt comfortable."
4.0,"I read the reviews, so I thought I should get a size up. Don‚Äôt if you‚Äôre on the smaller side of a size. I wear medium when it runs small and a small when the item in question runs larger. This shirt runs large, so keep it in mind. Other than that, it‚Äôs great! Comfy and cute: my favorite combo in clothes"
4.0,I've had this for awhile now and I've had not a single issue with it. My only gripe is that it'd be even better if maybe the mouth somehow could open bottles
4.0,"I bought this mask for an older small framed woman.  This mask is best for large faces.  She walks around stores with the words ""I'm hard"" clearly visible.  However ""of hearing"" is under her chin..."
4.0,I bought this in the size I wear and they were way to big I ended up giving them to somebody else who was 2 sizes larger and they still fit like full pants instead of capris but they like them
4.0,"Loved this dress. Loved everything about it. It looks beautiful on me. Why I did not give it five star, is because I could not zip up completely. It is not fit for busty girl.  So, I have to return. üòí"
4.0,Soft and cool fabric. Pretty but not very forgiving of my bra bulge/ muffin top. It shows your every curve. It you like dresses form fitting than size is as expected. I felt it was a bit small.
4.0,"Well made , on the thicker side. Great for the price. Recommended!"
4.0,Expected fit
4.0,"These pants are super cute with a crop top. They go up on my torso just the right amount. Not too high or low. Legs couldn't be any smaller, so if you have large thighs, these might not work. I have average size thighs, and I wouldn't want them any tighter. I'd recommend to size up, as I usually am M and ordered L in these."
4.0,Would give it a 5 üåü but not a fan of Velcro. Over all very nice looking wallet<br /> feels good in back pocket.
4.0,"Material is comfortable, the graphic is a little pixelated in the actual tank"
4.0,"Just received these for an upcoming trip.  Price was right and i needed 2 carry on suitcases. They are super light weight, and fit a weeks worth of clothes, toiletries, and 3 pairs of shoes each. Not a big fan of the handle but it pulls around fine!"
4.0,I first brought this item from Spirit halloween store and my daughter loved it. The dress had a white run in the fabric two inches over from the necklace print :( . She loved how silky the dress felt.
4.0,Just in time for the fall weather!
4.0,This is a one size fits all for glasses. I like it because it is light and The gray filters do the job for me
4.0,"Bought these for a gift, they absolutely loved them."
4.0,"I am overall satisfied with the necklace. The pendant; however, is flat - not rounded as it appears in the picture."
4.0,"Hard to keep around the shoulders, rides up a lot. But otherwise good"
4.0,Color and it was for me
4.0,larger than I expected
4.0,"Beautiful jacket, I just did not need the fluffy lining."
4.0,Very comfortable üòâ
4.0,My girl friend she like. A lot.
4.0,In the picture and in person it looks like sweatshirt material.  It's actually pretty thin.
4.0,Beautiful. I love to wear it.
4.0,"I like the softness and design. I didn't like the placement of the stitching making the words a bit smushed, or the price of nearly $15. But it's the design I really wanted."
4.0,"These do work.  You have to experiment a little bit to find the right spot on the eyeglass frames so the silicone holders meet your ears at a good spot.  The clear is a translucent color as some others have noted.  They mostly stay out of sight, but are visible from behind, so there is a little fashion concern, but from a functional standpoint, they work well."
4.0,Works as advertised.<br /><br />The product is easy to install and has lasted for several months. I would certainly buy this tape again should I need this type of product again.
4.0,"It puts on a light show every time you press the button to show the time.  It can be set to display the time automatically at 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes.  Works great.  My only problem is after having the band adjusted as small as I could it's still a little more loose than I like."
4.0,Pictures imply two separate belts but it's really two belts in one and looks great on either brown or black side!
4.0,Nice fabric. Looks good.
4.0,This is super cute. I would go a size larger or2. My husband had to close the buttons for me.
4.0,I've only been using it a few days and it seems to be a good size. I had to superglue the strap together as it came apart the first I &#34;tried&#34; it on.
4.0,Seems like a good flip/flop but with fairly recent purchase I can't say much about about its staying power. I just hope can keep them from being a chew toy for my dog.
4.0,"Ok I see many reviews about these bands and the issue with them disconnecting from watch multiple times and not securing properly.<br />Well I had a similar issue and after trying to switch out the clasp from the old band and the problem being the same as the watch wouldn't connect securely to band, I examined the connection closely and after tightening the screws as best as I could and the problem persisted,I loosened them about half a turn and the band slid into the connection and clicked into position easily and securely and has not given any issues since.<br />Now the band lloks great and stays firmly in place."
4.0,It runs a little smaller
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute skirt!! I liked it for my golf outing! i ordered a medium and it fit as expected
4.0,I have a windows laptop for work and it fits snug. its okay its cute its good for some things but not too good for packing a lot of things its mainly for show
4.0,"I liked this item well enough. It appeared to be well made, and the purple color was true to the picture. However, I ended up returning in order to get a travel wallet that held 2 passports for travel with my spouse."
4.0,We love slides!
4.0,Use it for my watch
4.0,These socks are very soft and comfortable feeling but they definitely do not smell or feel any different than other socks like these. So for the soothing /lavender part I highly doubt but they are comfy.
4.0,Very cute for a younger person
4.0,"Size S fits right,  I'm 115lb. It is really see through, but works with a slip underneath. It is rather long though and I'm 5.5"
4.0,"I am very pleased with my purchase. They fit perfectly, and the material is very soft. I love that they have pockets!"
4.0,"Very cute. Runs a little small. My 14 month old grandson who wears 18M clothes is wearing this size 24M right away. I ordered two similar pair in 18M-they fit fine for the first try-on, and we're waiting until after a wash to see if they still fit."
4.0,"These sandals are H.O.T.!! My boyfriend loves when I wear them :) however, they are not as comfy as other reviews claim. They're not entirely easy to walk in but what heels are? I think I was expecting tennis shoe comfort based on the other reviews. They start to hurt after an 8 hr day, or about 4 hrs on your feet."
4.0,Love my vest except it‚Äôs tight around the waist when it‚Äôs zipped. Also wish it came with a battery.
4.0,This dress is very sheer. You will need to wear a slip or another dress under. But it is very cute and fits as expected.
4.0,"This is a cute watch band and it fits the watch just right.  I have a 44mm.  The quality is just okay, I don't know how long it will hold up with continued wear.  Most likely the shiny covering will start to wear off the band.  It's comfortable enough and lightweight.  I have not continued to wear it because it's not my personal style once I saw it in person."
4.0,"I wasn't really expecting anything fancy with this pack, especially not for six bucks but the variety I got was good enough for the price. Got a bunch of different colors, packaged very nicely, and arrived ahead of time. Can't complain"
4.0,"Nice but can't see the stone in this on at all, unless you hold it up close to your eyes"
4.0,"To me ‚Äúchiffon‚Äù implies lightweight and floaty, which this shirt is not (even in the thin/sheer version). It‚Äôs a sturdy polyester that I think will be able to easily handle some inevitable rough treatment at the beach. I also am a sucker for things that don‚Äôt need ironing after a wash, and this is just that type of material. It‚Äôs not as soft as rayon of course, but who wants to iron on vacation?! Ohh, and it has pockets too. I liked this shirt/dress/coverup far more than I expected to, and will be buying it in more colors."
4.0,"I was looking for something summery that I could wear over tank tops. I have a tendency to get cold more easily than most people I know. This is perfect for that and matches the colors I like to wear. The sleeves are a bit tight, but not uncomfortable once you get is on. My only real complaint is the puffy shoulders, which you can't see in the picture. The fit is definitely as expected. I am 5'2&#34; 135 and I got the small. Fits just right. Very lightweight, so you're getting some blockage from the breeze, but you're not going to overheat. I think it will work well for spring and autumn as well. I was just kind of expecting straight, smooth shoulders so I need to get used to the &#34;puffy&#34; shoulders."
4.0,I don‚Äôt dislike the product. Great look and length. Just a little snug for a large.
4.0,"Muy buena calidad de materiales, como lo indica la descripci√≥n, pero creo que est√° mal tallado, compre XL y era talla L."
4.0,"Super soft & comfy, fit as expected & it's a nice length, not too short. I've already warned my boyfriend I will be stealing it from him."
4.0,I like their design aesthetic and they are sturdy.
4.0,Looks better wore.  look cheap when I first opened. it but reasonable right so great work outfit
4.0,"good fit! material is a little thin, but works great with layers."
4.0,"Good shoe, fast delivery, competitive price."
4.0,As described and very comfy
4.0,Craftsmanship is lacking. The cubes were not trimmed before plating. Jagged edges. Looks cheap.
4.0,I didnt expect much from this but it turns out I really like it.  I like that it is unusual without being so strange that I feel weird wearing it.<br /><br />It is well rafted. It comes in a nice little plastic box and a bag- could well be a gift for someone.
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on it!  It was super wrinkly, but very comfortable!"
4.0,"I bought both a necklace and bracelet of the same cut, and I'm very happy with both. I wanted them in titanium because I hate having to treat jewelry with kid gloves. I wear these constantly: working, working out, swimming, showering, etc., and they look exactly the same as the day they arrived.<br /><br />There are two reasons for which I gave this four stars instead of five:<br />1. Some of the links aren't closed as tightly as they could be. I have no fear of the chains coming apart; I'm talking about a few gaps of a millimeter or less. It's purely an aesthetic issue, and, really, I'm the only person looking closely enough to notice.<br />2. The other issue is also aesthetic. The underside of the clasp says ""Japan"", which I find very tacky.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this necklace."
4.0,i purchased these goggles for my son that ski's. They are not very thick but seem to be a little cheaply made. The foam on the inside is cushy but it could of been applied better. Overall for the price its a good deal. These are perfect for the beginner.  They arrived before the time estimated. They did estimate 3 to 5 weeks. They came half in and half out of a bubble pack inside another bag.
4.0,good product but i felt a bit uncomfortable to wear the whole day.  it is good to wear maybe half day.
4.0,None for either.
4.0,Good buy! Bought these for my son that is 6‚Äô3. He stated that the material is soft and comfortable but as long as the model iin the picture. But other than that good buy.
4.0,"Really adds some extra snazz to a gift. I used this for a proposal to my girlfriend, who is now my fiance and it really does highlight the ring and make it stand out. My fiance was almost more impressed with the box than the ring :)<br /><br />Only one downside to look out for. The slot does not grip the ting too well. I had a matched set in there, and had to stop and check frequently as the rings would come loose and rattle around in the box. Could cause a misshap if you're not careful with ensuring everything is inserted and aligned correctly prior to 'the presentation'"
4.0,"My husband used this vest & tie in our wedding.  He is about 5'11 and 180lbs. The large was too big,  so we got a medium. The Medium fit perfect. Very nice vest,  lots of compliments."
4.0,"The gray one is very fashionable, the black one not so much."
4.0,I purchased this for my sister's graduation.  it was beautiful and she loved it.  It was perfect for the occassion.
4.0,These run small so size up.  Plastic beads but still pretty bracelet. Elastic was not very elastic.  If right size would have been happy with purchase.
4.0,I am a big Harry Potter fan. This shirt is so cute and fits well
4.0,No dislike the cut could be funny as in smaller . So order the next size up. I was dope in this fit for sho
4.0,"The dress is very pretty. The bottom part of it is stretchy(which I like because it doesn't squeeze the life out of me) and it looks like the picture. The reason why I rated 4 out of 5 is because the button on the back isn't stuck on the dress very well. But if you know how to sew, like me, it should be an easy fix (; btw if you're wondering what size to get, i am 5'6&#34; 155lbs, ordered a Large. Hope it helped"
4.0,There not that breathable
4.0,Very pretty dress but too small for me..need to return.good cloth quality  too..
4.0,This was a really great head prop.the shipping came fast it's not Halloween 2017 yet but had to get this for my headless horseman costume.there was a few errors on the quality like the rat and a piece of glue on the eye part
4.0,Soft and shiny; it completes a major ensemble that I wear on Thursday nights. I really love the color pink. It is my signature color!
4.0,GF loved it just could see the glue that held it in and a lot thicker then then I thought.
4.0,It‚Äôs my go to bag for work. Fits everything I need inside. Has nice pockets in front for my wallet & purse. Phone easy access on the side.
4.0,"Just got this today after searching for a backpack/purse that is not too big, not too small, convenient and functional that will fit my macbook air 11&#34; I got the charcoal grey, which is a little darker than it appears in the photo, but still technically charcoal. It looks great with the brown trim so I'll be able to wear it with everything. I wish it had a few more &#34;features&#34; on the inside like pen pockets, and perhaps an inside zippered pocket, but for only $13 it's quite a fantastic deal.<br /><br />On the previous user's review, I did take note of any potentially fraying stitching and took a lighter to them. I don't see any potential problems though.<br /><br />It seems well made, and I may treat it with otter wax to make it waterproof."
4.0,The intial ribbon leaves some to be desired but overall awesome product.
4.0,They fit as expected. Daughter love them
4.0,It might‚Äôve been me not looking carefully enough at the materials but the dress doesn‚Äôt look quite like the picture. Material was a little shiny but otherwise comfortable and not too seethrough. Overall very happy
4.0,"It fits well. I don't love the side slits because as a mama I'll need to wear something under it so my sides don't show. Other than that, it seems to be a versatile piece I can wear with jeans or leggings. I am 5'6&#34; 133lbs with a 33&#34; inseam wearing a size small."
4.0,"I got the 4mm size because I have scrawny ear lobes and bigger stones hang down and look like they are ready to fall out.<br /><br />I like to put in some relatively inconspicuous studs and wear them 24/7, and change to whatever fancy earrings for special occasions.<br /><br />Stainless steel earrings tend to have tighter fitting backs than any of the gold ones I've had. So that makes these even more suitable for put them in and forget then use.<br /><br />These are stainless steel so I feel more confident of not being irritated.  I've had the first pair in for a bit less than a week I think and so far they are quite comfortable and feel secure.<br /><br />They are called piercing studs, but they don't have the typical large diameter post with the needle-sharp point or come in the two piece type bubble that I'm used to.<br /><br />I like the thinner posts, because if I wear other, non piercing earrings for any time, putting the piercing studs back in trend to be a bit difficult to insert and feel like they are stretching the holes.  But I'm not sure how suitable they would be for actual piercing.<br /><br />They look mostly like the pictures, but I think the colors may be a bit less vibrant than shown here.  That's the only reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5. I still like them quite a bit.  Maybe the bigger size CZs are more like the colors shown."
4.0,"Very good bag, good design bigger than I expected it to be when opened."
4.0,"Free necklace did not arrive with it. Its stiff but a kinda cute 80's throw back style, ok for the price."
4.0,A little pricey compared to other stores but they arrived fast and are exactly the same as the other Puma socks I got at my local department store.  They don't come loose or wear fast.  They hold up after many washes.
4.0,Nice but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the size and it was much smaller than I was expecting.
4.0,i recently received this and it looks as described. Diameter a bit smaller than i imagined
4.0,I have been impressed with the sports bras this company makes. The fabric is soft and moves with you. I like the removable padding‚Äôs and the unique cross cross back. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the brand plastered on back in a large font.
4.0,Not bad a taller profile hat for those that like a taller hat and not one of those head huggers.
4.0,Just got these earrings and they are really cute. The size is substantial- true to size. I‚Äôm happy. I would order if had different designs.
4.0,"Pretty good product, but not without its glitches...There‚Äôs a learning curve with getting the fit right, even then the watch doesn‚Äôt fell totally secure like with normal nato straps. Also, success the strap is elastic, the metal buckle always feels like it‚Äôs digging into your wrist."
4.0,Some were hard to get the ball off of. One lost a ball within a week. Not sure if that is a design flaw or just how it goes.
4.0,"I was so excited for this poncho. Lots of women around my office have similar styles and I thought they were so cute. While the quality of the poncho is nice, it just doesn't flow the way I wanted it to. It seems boxy when viewed from the side. I'll still give it 4 stars, because it's a great item, just not for me."
4.0,"They sent me the small size.  too small for me, but my wife likes them.  They are warmer than the large size of zero gloves they sent me, which did not work very well for the cold.<br /><br />A good glove for the winter"
4.0,"I like the concept of being worn on the Back! Was able to adjust the strap just under my bust line f/ stability as well.  However, the Storage section could be a bit Larger /  Deeper."
4.0,"These are pretty and very comfy (and I like the pretty pink shoebox, too!). I like the thick sole, which protects my feet when I go get the mail! The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that my toe has pierced through the fabric."
4.0,Fit well however there is a constant need to adjust after different exercises
4.0,i love these earrings! and i get compliments on them when ever i wear them but the stems are thick and when i first started wearing them to work by the end of the day my ears were hurting.  they are so cute i suffered thru and after a couple of weeks its not so bad
4.0,Nice dress but the top fits me a bit strange. I just don't like how my breast looks in the dress.
4.0,"Product quality is okay, a little small."
4.0,Nice fabric but runs very large
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and about 185 lbs, 38D bra size. I usually vary between L and XL. I do carry some weight in my tummy and arms so I was worried about fit on this shirt but it was pretty perfect. The arms and chest are tight but manageable. It is very loose in the waist so I belted it, which looks great. I'll probably buy in more colors. It did need ironed out of the box. Not sure how it will handle being washed -- hopefully it doesn't shrink too much. I may hand wash just in case."
4.0,"Since Amazon is making war on the natural world by firing employees who dare to speak out against climate change, we must do it for them. This is not up for debate or for too-rich corporations to capitalize on. Do what you can to fight climate change by reducing your dependence on fossil fuels/plastic and the use of poisons and weed/insect killer. For the life of us all! PLEASE, do what you can --- and plant a tree!"
4.0,"These came quickly- and they are beautiful. A little smaller than I was expecting, but once I put them on & pulled my hair up- they were perfect. Well packaged too!"
4.0,A tad on the large size.  Fabric is nice and warm but stretches out with several wearings.  After washing it's fine for a time.
4.0,purchased to have extra glasses in separate rooms & they did the trick just fine.
4.0,"My daytime vision is still at 20/20, but my nighttime vision is not quite a good. I bought these hoping to sharpen the street signs a little. Well, that didnt happen. But I did notice that my eyes were less fatigued when driving on overcast days or during sunsets. If you're looking to improve your vision at night, go get some prescription glasses before cause an accident."
4.0,They are very pretty and I like the color variation.  But these are HUGE. I got them for my 3 month baby and they were really big on her. I tried re tying one but it's too complicated so I guess I will just have to wait till shes older to use these.
4.0,Very pretty hat.  Fits a little snugly.  Nice shapeable brim.
4.0,Nice top - great with leggings
4.0,"Love the color. Felt like the material was a little thin but otherwise I'm pleased. Oh by the way, it had a strange smell so had to be washed immediately."
4.0,I like this poncho with batwing sleeves.  I am a petite 5'1'' but it still looks good.  My one complaint is that the yarn is not great quality.
4.0,"Arrived early, thank you!<br />Necklace is exactly as pictured, I'm sure my daughter will love it, is a birthday gift."
4.0,Just got this today. Looks good. Vibrant colors. Giving as a gift. Gotta clean it tho...kinda has a film on it.
4.0,Very cute!! Ordered for my nephew..
4.0,Chain broke as soon as I tried to put it on the first day I opened package and looks very cheap however the charm is dainty and I loved it
4.0,Great dress. Wish it was a little thicker though
4.0,Cool and nicely fitting.
4.0,"We have gotten a few different bear suits for our new grandson. They are easy to put on and take off and they look absolutely adorable. This one, however, is made of material that was thinner than the others."
4.0,"I wore the watch for 4 years. Always stayed on time (never had to fix the time except for when I bought it) and the alarm worked great. It never bothered me in the shower, or in classes, and you can set it to beep every hour (and you can turn it off just as easily.) BUT... after 4 years water got through, despite the ""Waterproof"" it had claimed. I had to toss it. But aside from that, it was a fantastic watch, and I will recommend it to anyone reading this.<br />I think I'll name him Tock?"
4.0,This umbrella provides adequate shade for my patio. I just wish it would tilt.
4.0,Material is very nice soft the top is quite long though
4.0,"They fit well. However, do not put bulky socks on your child or these will be pretty tight."
4.0,A little smaller then expected but butter soft.
4.0,Vell done
4.0,These glasses do keep the sun out but they are not that comfortable on the nose.
4.0,nice. I can wash them off when dirty
4.0,It is just as you see it
4.0,"I have ordered several small charms with a dental theme from ETSY vintage sites, eBay, and AMAZON--they will help to embellish my special project for a wonderful dentist who deserves special recognition!!"
4.0,Cute but somewhat small. Tutu  stays flipped up in the back.
4.0,I liked the different colors
4.0,"The White is a very clean, bright white which is appreciated. This works great for small builds as it does run small.  If you want cleavage, this will do the trick. No bra needed (I have cancer in Spine and this shirt helps immensely as no wired or added layers are needed). Perfect shirt for any woman needing a lift or with smaller chests. Perked up my inverted girls immediately ü§≠üòâ"
4.0,Looking  good
4.0,Soooo cuteüòçüå∫üå∏üåºüå∑üçÇüåª
4.0,I got the small. I should have gotten an extra small. It is very comfortable and versatile. I will say that the color I expected was like a burgundy color. The color I got was more cranberry. Much brighter than I thought.
4.0,Dress is beautiful but a little snug at the chest. I can still wear it but I usually don‚Äôt wear snug clothing. I‚Äôll keep it and wear for special occasions
4.0,I LIKE THE TEXTURE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED JUST A LITTLE MORE ROOM BUT THEY DO FIT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM. BUT IF YOU ARE OVER A SIZE 16 THEY MAY BE A LITTLE SNUG.
4.0,Comes large and is really warm. Overall a great costume!
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings.  Just the right size and nice bling.  I took off one star because they are a bit heavier than I'd like, but I still wear them on occasion."
4.0,Beautiful color disappointed with the cross it looks and fells flimsy and cheap.
4.0,"Loved the design, and the receiver enjoyed the sentiment! Unfortunately I returned it as it was too small. If the receiver has small wrists, go for it! The quality is great.  The diameter was too small for the intended."
4.0,I loved everything  about this nightgown but the lace color. It is a true peach and I wanted a darker nude
4.0,It‚Äôs just so cute..! I love a Holsteins..! I was a little disappointed that the wording was a little messed up.
4.0,"I am 5'3, 120lb and it was a bit snug"
4.0,Great gift and good quality. Except one of the browtines broke off with no cause.
4.0,Not only are the masks cute but they are great for extended wear.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.
4.0,"Its exactly what it seems in the picture.. Kind of lightweight, however it looks good and can be worn for formal or informal occasions.<br /><br />Bought one in brown one in black."
4.0,"If you order this watch, make sure you're getting the day of the week displayed in ENGLISH.  I had to return mine because the date was displayed in Chinese characters!"
4.0,"I really like the feel of the fabric (not paper thin) and the stripes are very stylish! The length was a bit longer than I expected. Definitely tunic style. I was swimming in the width of it though. It's not very tailored in the waist and it balloons out quite a bit. But it fits properly in the sleeves. I feel like if I went down a size to narrow the width that it would be tight under the armpits etc.<br />Still, a very swanky yet casual style. I can tailor it myself in the waist."
4.0,I wasn't expecting much for buying a dress on amazon but I received several compliments and the pockets were a big bonus!
4.0,she likes it...
4.0,"i‚Äôm short , so it‚Äôs just a tad too long , however with heels on it is perfect ! it looks just as it does in the pictures , for once online, and it looks great ! it can be dressed up or down and the sheerness and the way it hangs on your body really thins you out , especially if you tie the belt at the the thinnest part of your waist ! the only down side is that coming out of the package it has a very odd smell like a plastic factory . so you need to let it air out or instantly wash it ."
4.0,Like the material but runs a little smaller than normal.
4.0,The hat was sent on time and the quality is good. Velcro can be adjusted at the rear of the head. Color is firm even when washed.
4.0,"Seller sent me a Medium instead of XL - which is what I ordered. That's the only reason for the 4 stars.<br />But it worked out okay because I gave the dress to my niece, who LOVED it. She is a school teacher and dress fits her perfect.<br />Great price too."
4.0,Fit is snug.
4.0,"I got this for Halloween, and possibly future conventions.  I thought it looked great for the price, as a really good jedi uniform could cost well over $100.  I got it home and tried it on.  There were no instructions, so I had to guess on how to put  it on based on where the velcro was and what the pieces appeared to be, along with the advertisement images.  I got the XXL size, being as how I'm kind of padded in my waste area.  The pants were way too huge and baggy for my size (I'm just average in height, not tall like most of my weight).  I get it, that they tuck beneath the boots (which I do not have).  Sadly, I cannot have baggy clothing in some areas that I plan on wearing this, and have to have special shoes, so I am going to have to go with a pair of khaki pants or similar that are beige or brown in color.  The material appears to be mostly nylon with some cotton mixed in for durability.  The ""leather belt"" is faux leather.  from a distance it looks real, from up close, not so much.  Still, I cannot wait to wear this for 2022 Halloween, May 4th,  and future sci fi conventions"
4.0,I bought this as a back up to a monokini i ordered for Carnival Monday . Fit was excellent and and print was better than I expected . Unfortunately within five minutes of serious partying the plastic hook snapped. Fortunately it was a style that stayed on and I was able to safety pin it. Not mad tho it looked great .
4.0,"The shirt is very nice and soft, the length is a bit longer than expected, which is actually a good thing considering the possible shrinkage after washing and drying. The only reason for 4 stars, is that it took many weeks to receive."
4.0,"Once I trimmed off the excise sizing, it fit like a glove (or a sock in this case).  The extra cushioning in the heel and ball of foot really helps and the arch support supports well."
4.0,These are quality shades!
4.0,This is adorable. 34 D(VS size) and i ordered a large. More cute than supportive and i knew this would be the case.  It's more like a narrow bandeau with straps.  If i would have ordered up a size it would have been too loose in the band/clasping.  I'm happy...ordering another in a different color.<br />.
4.0,"You can't see through this at all really, so don't buy it expecting that.<br /><br />It works great as a wig cap for a mask if you fold it up, or a compliment to a helmet cosplay that you want to black out your eyes, but visibility is low."
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but nice case."
4.0,"The outfit is awesome! It is a little loose on me. I'm 5'9&#34; and about 130, got the medium size and height is perfect, just needs a little nip and tuck. Assembly is a little confusing, didn't realize how many pieces are seperate when I got it, but the picture of the light jedi robes helped figure it out. I'm really happy with this purchase! Oh, and the cloak isn't included, I got it seperately"
4.0,Love the fabric. A little big on the sides but super cute top. Love it!(:
4.0,These earrings are very nice but a little heavy. Still Im glad I got them‚ò∫
4.0,I love the fabric of this dress. It‚Äôs not thin and cheap like a lot of others. It‚Äôs very comfortable and not too short like some are. The only negative I found was the seam down the middle of the front and back. Why there? There‚Äôs a slight bunching around the neck that straitens out with a slight shift. Not a biggie. However I have fibromyalgia and tend to nap during the day and the middle seam wakes me if I roll over onto my back. So in all I really like this dress.
4.0,great belts
4.0,"I needed a pair of red gloves for my home made captain America costume for Halloween. I couldn't find any that liked the part, for my small hands, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. I came across these and they were great! Great price and great quality!"
4.0,"Fits well but the cups are very high and I have gapping. I can go to VS or Frederick's of Hollywood and I'm always a B cup so I think this is abnormal or it's the cut or the fact the cups are so high. It's a comfortable bra though and I like the taglessness of it. Also, the straps don't fall constantly. It definitely has the push up! It can be worn under a tee shirt or anything else you don't want seems showing through. Tight things, white things.. it will work well."
4.0,It was a great gift for my daughter but it would have been better if these had been in women's sizes as well as Junior sizes.  It's hard to determine what size a woman would wear in a Juniors.  The material is soft and the shirt is well made.
4.0,I sized up because I like my tanks flowy for workouts...this is perfect & super comfy!
4.0,I loved it I just wish it was a little longer. I am 5'6 weighing about 200.
4.0,"Its an awesome scarf HOWEVER, in one review i read prior to purchasing the scarf,  the person mentioned the scarf leaves &#34;fuzzies&#34; that are noticeable on dark clothing, and that proved to be true.  I assume the scarf can be worn in warmer weather against &#34; less covered skin&#34; which hopefully eliminates the &#34;fuzzy&#34; issue.  All in all its a fun scarf - especially if you like fringe."
4.0,"I decided to go with this umbrella because of the neutral color. I have ten  concrete embedded umbrella anchors around the perimeter of my pool, which allow me to move them at will, according to where the sun is, as it moves through the afternoon. I have 5 umbrellas in cream or beige color and wanted to make it an even number, for symmetry along the edges of the pool. I have never bought a colored umbrella which did not fade in the sun. They all do. And when the umbrellas are collapsed, they end up fading more in the areas exposed to the sun and when you raise them up, they look like lengthwise stripes of darker and lighter colors. SO I settled on using only white, cream, or very light beige which do not degrade in appearance due to the UV rays of the sun.<br /><br />This one matches others which I have purchased at Big Box stores for twice this price. I deducted one star for a simple reason that one never knows whether the thickness of the metal post will withstand strong winds and many of them can buckle or bend and break at the stress points such as the umbrella hole in a patio table and in my case at ground level where the umbrella inserts into a 6"" deep brass anchor sleeve. At these lower price points I guess one can consider these to be ""throw away"" items. I do like this one for its appearance and typical function for this type of umbrella."
4.0,I like it. the fit was correct. it does smooth back fat while also giving your breast a perkiness.
4.0,I was very impressed with the quality of the watch box when I received it! It looks very classy and it was bigger than I expected...which is great since my husband has a lot of watches! I can't wait to give it to him for Christmas!
4.0,"Small, doesn't glow as good as I though. it's still a puffy heart  shaped charm that's very pretty."
4.0,"Really like the cut of this dress. It is super wide at and just below the hips but I enjoy that ‚Äòballoon‚Äô look. You could also easily eliminate some of the volume with a couple stitches at one of the folds. The material, like all the mordenmiss items I‚Äôve purchased, is good quality and has a flattering drape."
4.0,"Not great quality (cheap and super thin material), but decent enough for the price :)"
4.0,The clip end of this key chain securely holds the keys. It is easy to attach and remove keys. It is bigger than I would of like.
4.0,"it is big for my baby, but anyway it is nice."
4.0,They are ok so far
4.0,"Beautiful and elegant, a bit heavier than I expected."
4.0,"Somewhat small in the arms, but the dress is really pretty on with leggings and boots."
4.0,"Scratches after a while, not expected out of Tungsten"
4.0,"Fits well, looks nice. Just don't wear cheap costume jewelry with it; the material catches and pills."
4.0,Arrived on time but bigger than expected
4.0,"I‚Äôm normally a size 0/XS and I ordered the green dress in S. It‚Äôs a little loose on me but not too bad. Cute to throw on for running errands. I like it but I‚Äôm not in love with it, if that makes sense."
4.0,Good sunglasses for a hippie costume.
4.0,Very nice clean backpack. Wish there where more pockets and the waist strap was a little bit bigger. Otherwise very satisfied.
4.0,"Cute. Not sure how long it will last. Feels cheaply made. But for the price, I'd buy again."
4.0,"Came in 9 days, really pretty, but they are super small."
4.0,My package was delivered to my next-door neighbor's address but other than that I'm really happy with them
4.0,Fine for the cost and purpose. Use in my beach bag.
4.0,The Writing on the side was coming off before I even opened the package.
4.0,The lenses are very small so they aren't practical but the overall look is still very cute
4.0,"Used them today on my trip Aldi's. Great product, held the vast majority of my larger grocery pick up that was majority refrigerator and freezer items. Easy assembly and very sturdy. Didn't run straight home after shopping and all of my items stayed frozen or cold."
4.0,"I wanted a sock to cover my ankles during the winter as most of my socks are ""no-shows"".  These do the trick and are very comfy.  I wear a size 6.5 shoe and they are a bit big, but for the price and quality - a steal!"
4.0,Mostly satisfied. Look pretty! Love the variety. But disappointed one came missing a crystal. Just got it out of the mail like that. ‚òπ love the cute floral bag they came in. Added photo and circled missing crystal.
4.0,Great  product!!!
4.0,"Love these dresses I ordered  three 2 blacks  and blue, however the blue dress had loose stitching/thread around the neck and lower zipper or somebody had it and stretched it out I did return it for a New blue dress so hopefully I would love  the one arriving Thursday !"
4.0,"Fits well, cute cocktail dress!"
4.0,They are great socks! They fit my size 10 just fine except the purple ones. The purple ones are regular size in the toe and two sizes smaller in the heal and ankle. If you get them on you will be removing them immediately because they hurt.
4.0,This dress was so beautiful! Just wasn't right for my body type.  Had to return.
4.0,"I love it, but one of the feathers fell off after three months"
4.0,140lbs. 5'6&#34;. Fits perfectly !! I took the cups out and it doesn't pucker anymore. Hopefully holds up when wet
4.0,Very nice. I'll probably buy more.
4.0,"I got this nightgown in my usual size, large, and it fits me well. It's made out of a material that is soft and stretchy, so it's very comfortable to wear. That said, the listing is very misleading, as it says this nightgown is 92% cotton, 8% spandex, when the tag on the garment I received states 95% polyester, 5% spandex - this is very misleading. The fabric is lightweight, maybe a little thinner than a typical t-shirt, but enough to feel covered. The tag indicates that the nightgown should be hand washed or dry cleaned, but I've had no issues with machine washing it on the gentle cycle and letting it air dry. Overall I really like this nightgown, but I'm taking off a star for the discrepancy on the fabric type - it's not a big deal for me but could be for others."
4.0,This product is beautiful! A little chunky and big for my wrist but still makes a good conversation piece!
4.0,Light weight nit perfect for were I live
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. I ordered it in Champagne for my Wedding Dress. This company will make the dress custom for you if you send in your measurements which is what I did. For the most part the dress fits well but Iam going to have to get it tailored on the sides and taken up on the bottom. It's about 5"" too long. Overall Iam very happy with the look of the dress. Very elegant and was custom made and in my hands in one week."
4.0,I love my band and it‚Äôs easy to adjust to my wrist
4.0,Beautiful watch. It's prettier than the picture. Purchased it for my mother for mothers day. She loves it. Great purchase.
4.0,got this to wear at my zumba class. have been wearing it at every class for about 6 months now. it is starting to fray a little and come apart where i tie it but it keeps the coins and it makes just the right amount of noise. and it makes zumba even more fun!
4.0,Very pretty and they arrived very quickly! My daughter loves them!
4.0,Buy a size larger than you normally wear
4.0,Its a nicely made and soft cardigan . I would not say its generous is size that depends on your chest size however I do like it very much and will purchase again if I want another cardigan of this quality . Came very fast and in nice packaging.
4.0,These were really soft and almost not denim like so they got very loose over the course of the day. Extra stretchy. Very cute just need to maybe go a size down to accommodate for the fabric type.
4.0,This was a cute little bundle I used for photo props for a Christmas party. Deducted one star because when I received the package one of the necklaces had a lot of bulbs that fell<br />off that I had to twist back on.
4.0,"It is a pretty necklace, but unfortunately one came broken. It was low cost and I really didn't need two identical hearts anyway so I'm not returning but maybe the company will know to pack it a little better. You can see a piece in the bag it came in too. It was inside a box with bubble wrap but I think the hearts should be wrapped separately."
4.0,All around good quality
4.0,Top is a bit large but other than that it is PERFECT!
4.0,"This is a great light summer wrap, perfect for warding off the chill of air conditioned offices. It's very soft and the fringed trim is cute but beware if you have a cat. Those swaying fringes are irresistible! I can't give full points for construction. One edge is raw and softly frayed. It's a nice effect. Not sure how it will wear though. The other edge is serged in white threat but not hemmed. The fringe yarn or string is tightly wound but not fastened. The edges are already coming apart. I have no problem with this. I just want to state that the look is going to change over time. I'm very happy with my wrap and would recommend it to others."
4.0,Comfortable. Too many pockets for Mtb.
4.0,We ordered this dress for our daughter who wears a size 14-16.  The dress was perfect and complimented her figure.  We used Amazon Prime and it arrived on time.
4.0,Well made and works as advertised.  A bit of an annoying gap when clipped on glasses.
4.0,Get a bigger size and it's just right
4.0,"comfortable hat, fits well. only issue I have is the thick band on the forehead portion of the hat because it holds heat in and makes it hot."
4.0,Cute...good material...wished it was a little bigger but a very nice top..love the color...
4.0,I thought it would have been big for my 9 year old but it‚Äôs just right.
4.0,Fit well. A little big in waist but that can be taken in. And a little shorter than expected but they'll be fine. Ordered a xxl usually wear a us large.
4.0,Fits really well. The color is accurate and very comfortable.
4.0,I like this shirt but it's a little sheer and you have to size way up for it to fit comfortably. I typically wear an xl but buy 2xl when I want it a little looser fitting. The 2xl in this fit more like a large. It fits but not as comfortably as I like. I'm losing weight so I decided to keep it but you do need to wear a tank top or cami underneath because you can see through it. There's no tag on the inside with size or washing instructions. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry because the material feels like it'd definitely shrink if dried in the dryer or washed in warm water. It hasn't had any pilling issues but I've only worn and washed it once. Overall it's a cute top but not the best quality.
4.0,"More sheer than appears in the picture, but that's no problem. Fits great and looks great."
4.0,It's a nice dress the material is thin but it will be nice for summer.
4.0,"ADORABLE! Good quality, decal has held up to at least half a dozen washes so far.<br />The Adult Men's M tee is a bit small and short.  Otherwise Love it."
4.0,"My only problem with this product is that it runs EXTREMELY small. So I had to order twice because the first one I got I ordered in Large and didn't pay attention that the seller said these are not American sizes. The next one I ordered in XXL. Large is basically a Women's small in American sizing and XXL is a Women's medium. The fabric is super soft but unlike most hoodies, does not stretch at all. Make sure that you pay attention to the sizing chart when you buy it."
4.0,"Fits smaller than I expected so order a size up. It‚Äôs made well and the fabric is soft, it‚Äôs just snug."
4.0,Fit almost perfect. The cup portion didnt fit as tightly as I would have liked but it still worked out for my vacation.
4.0,It‚Äôs a little see through
4.0,"I love this jacket. I'm usually a medium but the small fit perfectly. It's soft and warm, perfect for fall. Cute with jeans and sneakers or booties."
4.0,7/8/21 : Love the color. Washed it once & it shrunk a bit & got more wrinkled than I would want. Wonder how it‚Äôll hold up after the summer. Will update then.
4.0,Perfect little fall boots for my toddler
4.0,Very flattering dress.  I am a bigger girl so the arms are a bit snug but very wearable.  Ive gotten many compliments wearing it.<br />I hope the seller offers more color choice and designs in the xxl sizes because their quality is great
4.0,The quality is great.  But run small. I ordered XL and the size looks like medium
4.0,I was surprised at how great the quality was for the price! The fit is great for my 7 year old (we ordered a small). Perfect for athletic wear or under snow clothes-we will use for both. Love this product!
4.0,"I loved these, I really did. However, the glove material is not sturdy enough for regular use. I used one of the pairs for months without issue, but when using the second new pair they were damaged during the first use. Due to the lining of the gloves these are not salvageable in the event of a leak unless you manage to dry them completely and quickly."
4.0,Love them. So think and comfortable!
4.0,Nice big hood
4.0,Love this bag. The only problem I have is the placement of the strap loops. There not centred and the bag hangs lopsided.
4.0,"Cute capris! Size fit perfectly, has stretch and hugs your body nicely."
4.0,Fits a size smaller
4.0,"A very nice piece, my only complaint it that the ankle chain needs an extender. I have very slim ankles so ankle bracelets are never a problem but the chain on this jewelry is not very long. I can wear it but it I stretch my foot to far the wrong way I am certain it will pop so I am off to Michaels to do a quick fix. Other than the chain being a little short I think it is perfect."
4.0,Just remember they represent flash boy
4.0,"These are a good product, but they run small, suggest washing first and stretching while still wet, then they fit fine, good quality and colors"
4.0,not exactly what i expected but I still plan to keep it. probably not wear as much as i imagined
4.0,"The size is too small, looks spectacular the quality of the fabric is good really nice for that price I was expected something cheap  but not it is really amazing wearing this for my trip to ARUBA. no matter what I'm going to wear like that."
4.0,Nice pull tie.  The stones are fairly nicely quality.  Good value and good price!
4.0,Vibrant colors & really cute designs. They do have a bit of a strong odor. Hopefully that goes away after airing out. Great value for the price!
4.0,I liked the fact that the charms had freedom on them. I used them for a retirement party for a police officer so the cuffs worked for two reason police use cuffs and now he is free from duty.
4.0,"My brother is a big WWE fan and loves the Undisputed. I believe I got my brother a size medium. It is a little big, but my brother didn't care. He loves it so much! I'll give this a 4-star because of the size was a tiny bit big."
4.0,Looked a little small it was 3t/4t.... but fit perfect! Great material!
4.0,"Attractive royal blue color. The material is stretchy and a high cotton content (wash cold, air dry unless you want it to shrink). The materiel is very form fitting and has the potential to flatter or expose flaws depending upon your condition. It runs a little long on my wife; she loves the material and cut.<br /><br />Overall, she says it is a keeper. P-)"
4.0,This is a cotton night gown with black lace . Nothing  fancy. It‚Äôs a stretchy cotton fabric. True to size.
4.0,I love the cut and the material but the flag logo is a bit more ‚Äústamped‚Äù on then I thought. It looked like it would have a more rough and rustic feel but it doesn‚Äôt.  Fits true to size.
4.0,That was a gift for my wife. She's very happy and like it too much.
4.0,The shirt is on a stark white background and even the flowers are different... the pants are on a like cream/pink background. How is this a matching set? Very weird. I still love both - separately. I wouldn't put them together. The shirt was a bit tight.
4.0,"They are pretty big, not bad for the price.  The chain is the only thing holding it closed and because the chain is small, it tends to open partially. A heavier chain or chord would probably work better"
4.0,I am 5'6 145 and I got a medium. It fits nice be I could have done a small
4.0,"I am a 36B in bras and that is the size I went with for this bra. It fit as expected around the band. I like that the band is wide as well.<br /><br />The only quirky thing about this bra is that the cups are a bit large. They fit, but not like other 36B bras fit me. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal and it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of wearing the bra, just something to note.<br /><br />This bra is very well made and the subtle lace detailing is nice. The straps are also very sturdy and comfortable. This bra provides a lot of support. I recommend it!"
4.0,I gave this great romper 4 stars because it was short on me and I am petite 5'0&#34; 110lbs. But it was beautiful colors! I bought a small and the rest of the fit was great and the elastic on the top is great. Will definitely be wearing this on my next vacay!
4.0,Love the look of these just wish a little more tight fitting otherwise love them!
4.0,Looks great but subtract one star for lousy latch system. It will fall off every now and then.
4.0,Scarf is not light pink like picture it a darker pink it is big but not as big as picture shows I still like and would recommend it to others.
4.0,La talla es grande pero de buena calidad
4.0,"I got this for a Miguel cosplay from El Dorado. The color was spot on, but my only problem with this wig was the wefting was sewn so oddly. It was almost like it was sewn the wrong direction? I actually had to go in and sew down parts of the wig that were sticking up in weird places. It worked in the end, but I did have to put a bunch of effort in getting the hair to sit correctly so it didn't show the wefting underneath."
4.0,Really cute and we made them work but was sent the wrong size.
4.0,With the exception of the white stitching on the black belt..it was for a high school graduate to wear on graduation day..he loved it!
4.0,"Awesome pendant. The thong was too small to fit my neck, and the clasp is faulty and too decorative, which I'm sure adds to the price. I own several Alchemy pieces, and the pendant itself is great (although, every add I've seen makes it look &#34;flat&#34;, or &#34;antiqued&#34;...it is not. It's plated and shiny."
4.0,So cute and perfect for petite children! I couldn‚Äôt find anything to fit her at 2 years old because she‚Äôs still wearing 9-12 month old bottoms and these panties were the only thing I could find that worked for her. They even put the tag on the outside so it doesn‚Äôt itch. Definitely recommend!
4.0,its oK
4.0,"really good and beautifulÔºÅbut somewhat large to me üò≠. I am 159cm. I sent that to my roommate, she is 165cm, it fits her well, she loves it!"
4.0,A little heavier than I expected -- not warm enough for winter but *might* be a little too heavy for humid climates. Definitely comfortable though.
4.0,"Cute dress, Quality exceeded expectations for the price."
4.0,"I've purchased a lot of this low cost type of minimalist wallets and these are just as good as those costing 2- 4 times as much.  Mine was Khaki and was quite a bit darker than illustrated so i think the pictures are mixed up.  Otherwise, a great deal."
4.0,"This dress is super cute and a great quality! There is a layer of tooling between the lace and lining that I chose to cut out as it made the dress a bit too poofy at the hips for my liking. Once I cut it out, I loved the way it fit. The top is more form fitting and does not provide much give, but that‚Äôs what I liked about it. I would definitely purchase again."
4.0,"I like this watch, my other Casio, which was the smallest women's watch, broke and I wanted something small but with a light. This watch is still small enough for me, I do wish it was smaller but it works, and has a light. About the light though... It's not good. It's just good enough to barely see the opposite side of the watch face, barely. The light is the only reason i gave it 4 not 5 stars. It's waterproof, shows the date and day which is helpful. Overall glad to I bought this watch."
4.0,"Use a neck wallet instead so I don't have to be obvious and reach up under my pants so everyone can see me.  Or, I use it in a restroom stall so nobody will see me obtaining money or reaching for my passport.<br /><br />Never have to worry about pickpockets with this.  In the 80's, I wore a similar one with shorts.  People would stare, but I didn't care."
4.0,"I love this snow suite! I read reviews and knew it would run big. I used it recently for our towns Christmas tree lighting and felt comfortable knowing she was warm, even if it swallows her. I‚Äôll use next year too!<br />Quality is great and I love that it folded over the hands. Plus, the print I cute!"
4.0,"Keep feet warm if moving, but not if sitting out in the cold"
4.0,"I like these but seem a little cheap in workmanship.  We'll see how long they last.<br /><br />Also, should have one of the cuff links done so that anchor is inboard."
4.0,"I wear a size 12 in most things. I am 38 DD. 180lbs almost 5' 5&#34;. I bought an XXL and it fit great.<br />Every student decorated itwith fabric markers at the end of the school year and I wore it on the last day.<br />The length of the dress shrunk in the dryer. When I wear it on the first day of school, I will need leggings because it is now shorter than my comfort level. The width of the fabric did not shrink just the length."
4.0,Nice but bad material not like a Jean fabric
4.0,"It was my hope that having feet of different sizes that as the reviews said this ran small, the boot would fit my smaller foot and I could stretch the leather on the bigger one, or alternatively the shearling would compress.  There is a rubber toe gaurd at the end that means you can't stretch the leather (simple to do with most boots check You Tube).  But based on the reviews the boot should have fit my size 10 foot when I purchased an 11 and it w as way too short.<br />Truly wish manufacturers would be consistent at least on length when sizing products.  I still gave this 4 Stars because it was very attractive, did not make your feet look as if you were wearing clown shoes and I could tell they would be remarkably comfortable had they been long enough.  I tried a similar style by Pajar which was extremely comfortable also but made my feet look enormous.  Even with the sheep skin fleece lining the boot was not oversized.  It was very well made.  The traction looked as if it would be good.  The laces in a bright orange were fabulous looking.<br />So Santana FIX your sizing issues and I think you would have a bunch of new happy customers!"
4.0,"Good buy, liked the bright colors. I am 135 lb and boughy medium. Fits just right with no extra  room."
4.0,Order a size up‚Ä¶ too is non stretchy and has no give
4.0,"These are adorable! It sucks my toddler can‚Äôt fit them yet. I know I ordered a size small but the company sent me a medium. But other than that the stitching is sturdy, and the material is soft. Nice and plushy for busy feet. The sole is firm and has nice grip for smooth flooring. I like the Velcro detail for easy fastening for toddlers. Hopefully, next year she‚Äôll be able to wear them."
4.0,Gloves fit and work well. The padding is a little thin.
4.0,"This slim full zip jacket is exactly that, slim.  If you like a tight fit, this is a great option.  I found it a bit snug at first, yet it is breaking in and feeling more fitted and comfortable with wear.  Note that this is a thicker material than most fitness jackets and thus a bit warmer.  The olive color is exactly as shown in the picture."
4.0,These are just wonderful...nice and cosy for my feet.  The only problem is that is has a thick cushion on the bottom.  The first walking took a little time to figure out how to walk because my balance is not the best.  But I think they will be ok.  I like them.
4.0,"Fine, not the greatest, but fine. Good enough. One pack lasted about 8 months before holes showed up."
4.0,"So it is always hard for me with any shopping because I am a 37 year old with a tiny body size all around. I ordered small. I am 5'2&#34; and 104lbs. So I had to have a local tailor shorten the dress by 4&#34; . So now it fits pretty good: a little loose but not too bad. It is a very good dress for the price though because it looks good, and even fancier than the price."
4.0,"They‚Äôre not a thing of beauty, but they are inexpensive, and the Velcro works. Very easy to get on and off my wrist. I wish the colors were a little better, but at the price I paid I guess I can‚Äôt complain too much. Overall, this is a good deal, and it does the job I need. I really need Velcro to get the watch on and off easily and use it for exercise."
4.0,Lightweight. Stylish and fashionable. But visibility of the lenses was weird. I had to take them off to read or look at my phone screen.
4.0,Ive been looking forward to this blouse for weeks. Very happy with it. I always fit in small shirts but I know this product is coming from China so I bought a medium and it fits perfectly. It's a bit sheer tho so Definitely needs and undershirt especially if you plan to use as work clothes.
4.0,"Little bit stiff not soft as expected, fit is a little larger than I thought it would be too"
4.0,Granddaughter is very difficult about what shoes she will wear.  These shoes are very well made and cute.  I hope she will wear them.  Nothing to do<br />with the quality of the shoe.  She says she will wear them!  I am not the mother to enforce this.
4.0,Fits small compared to other Kirkland polo shirts.
4.0,"Bought for my long-haired 8-year-old son, who at first said they were too tight but I think got used to them (these are the first headbands he's worn) and now likes them a lot. Recommended."
4.0,"Super cute & comfy!<br />The only thing I will say, is that I like my sweatpants a little looser fitting, so I order a size up for the extra room. They are not as stretchy as I thought - but they are still my favorite pair of sweatpants at the moment!"
4.0,"The slippers have a nice gripped rubber bottom and the fabric is soft. For the size small just a bit snug. However, they work for the price which was good."
4.0,Slim fit but looks great. The white part is a bit see through but it's still really nice. Soft material
4.0,My friend and I bought this for an event with low expectations. When our dresses came a couple of days later we were pleased with the result. Would recommend this to anyone!<br />Very comfortable<br />Stylish<br />Good color<br />Love it!!!!!
4.0,"Really cute, but the smelt part of the wrap will tear if you pull tight."
4.0,The necklace arrived on time and name plate was very well done with accurate translation. She loved on sight and immediately put it on.  I just wish the chain was more substantial. I would have paid more for a better chain.
4.0,So cute and well made but run small. Saving them for the next kid instead!
4.0,"Had one part of leaf shape pointing outward, but I liked it.<br />However, I dropped dryer on it and it got smashed.<br />I tried to put it back to its shape but was impossible."
4.0,"Quality made, material is durable, sleeves are a little short"
4.0,"The shirt was very cute and well made. The only issue is I am 5‚Äô9 and it hit me at a different spot so the shirt looked awkward, would definitely purchase again if there was a longer option‚Ä¶ not a mid-drift kinda gal."
4.0,I got this for my 10 year old to put in her stocking as a stocking stuffer. She really likes owls so I thought it a pretty cool gift. She did like it and ended up hooking it to a bag she likes to use for sleep overs and taking things to do for longer trips in the car. Its a really nice quality and the detail is pretty neat.
4.0,Item as described......not a very long focal length but not having to hold a inspection light in the other hand is very convenient very good for looking at things close up
4.0,"I like this ring. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the anchor bottom (as looking at the ring) on the left. The anchor seems very thin on that side, noticeably so, and I wish it looked like the right side (a thick full side, looking like an actual anchor). Still, I wear it. I really like it. It‚Äôs ok and I enjoy it and in all fairness, the picture shows the flaw, but it‚Äôs not a 5. It‚Äôs an easy 4 though."
4.0,"This is, by far, one of my best purchases. I'm 5'5 and weigh 130lbs with a bust that's 37&#34; I ordered a large because I don't like things to be too tight. It fit exactly like I like it. Hitting just below the thigh/hip and loose across the chest.The fabric is polyester and cotton with 5% spandex. It feels very classy. It's made in China so I plan to wash it in cold and air dry it. I would suggest you pick where you want to have the zipper and leave it there, the zipper seems a little tempermental and the top gives enough that you can easily put it over your head with the zipper half way up. I had to work to get the zipper moving, It is also smaller than in the picture, noticeable but still small. However, because the fabric is a little light weight a heavier zipper might not have sat well.  I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the zipper."
4.0,"For the cost, it was as expected. Not terrible but not wonderful either."
4.0,"Was a hit at the holiday parties. The material isn‚Äôt the nicest, but face it, you weren‚Äôt buying this join your daily wear wardrobe."
4.0,They are exactly what they are suppose to be. My daughter has fun with them.
4.0,Size cut small
4.0,It‚Äôs a wrap around watch so it may be difficult to put on a first but looks great. Shipping took way way to long though
4.0,"Overall, a beautiful piece of jewelry for a great price. Only disappointment was the chain tassel had one chain longer than the others (easy to fix) and the piece of the jewelry holding the gemstone had a few metal burrs on it (which can be dremeled off). Nothing too difficult, but it is annoying that it wasn't exactly ready-to-wear right out of the box. Can't complain too much, though, given the price."
4.0,The helped tremendously with the new work uniforms to cover just where it was needed.
4.0,I got this with the gloves I ordered. It was a nice little bonus and I keep the gloves in them. Nobody wants to stick their hands in soppy gloves.
4.0,"Like the soft fabric of the underwear. Fits a little loo large around the legs. We have a 3YO but followed the weight specifications - still wearable, but a little loose.<br /><br />The interesting design encourages potty training to wear cool underwear :-)"
4.0,"These are not amazing. But for the price, you can't beat it."
4.0,"Thinner and smaller than expected, but I like the color"
4.0,"I bought them to wear while typing because my hands get cold, but I've also started using them first thing in the morning on my drive to school. They're comfortable and keep my hands warm while still giving me the movement I need to type and grip things that normal gloves make difficult. They fit me fine, but I have small hands, and they don't fit my brother, who has much larger hands than I do. Altogether a great purchase. I'm very happy with them."
4.0,"You will look snazzy on St Paddy's for sure. Trust me, this is a really cool hat to wear. Very comfortable!"
4.0,"Love the style and color, but they were a bit loose. Have to keep pushing them up on my nose."
4.0,"My daughter used this crown for her Sweet sixteen.  It‚Äôs beautiful and worth the money.  The only thing that my daughter wasn‚Äôt happy about was putting it on.  It has a hole where you put a bobby pin through that hurts when trying to put on, unless you‚Äôre having and updo rather than your hair loose.  With an updo I think it would be easier to adjust the crown and pin it to your hair.  My daughter had her hair loose which made it difficult."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e85424d173afb57856a1d6bdebc928cd]] Loved it! Very stretchy and comfortable
4.0,"Very nice for extra fuzzy type slippers, which I normally don't like."
4.0,"Me gusto mucho el producto, pero la talla es un poco m√°s grande de lo indicado."
4.0,Good quality cotton but super thin. Not really to keep baby warm in a cooler day.
4.0,"It‚Äôs just what i thought it would be, a tad bit to small for my liking but a good robe for around the house"
4.0,"Las compres para colocarmelas por debajo de un mono quir√∫rgico para lo cual son algo gruesas, pero precisamente por el grosor de la tela se ve que son bastante duraderas."
4.0,One of the chains was broken upon arrival but I fixed it.  The colors are just what I wanted.
4.0,These run small so you will need to order the next size up.  I tried 2 sizes up the first time and had to return that one.  The second one I got was made with a totally different fabric which was much nicer than the first one.  I am very happy with it.
4.0,The clapse kept opening. It was a gift for my daughter's wedding and haveway down the aisle it opened and fell off. I try to replace it and there was not another available and my daughter wanted to keep it.
4.0,This product is a little shorter than the picture shows. So if you are a little bigger ‚Äúup top‚Äù. May want to order a size larger than normal. Otherwise a very comfortable top
4.0,Its a good pair of glove. Bought it for my daughter for her biking excursion. Working out well. Good support.
4.0,Beautiful short but gave it only 4 star rating due to thin material! Not very stretchy either. But nice colores of flowers üå∏
4.0,Simple white cotton panties
4.0,"The bracelets look super cute and unique. Although, the gold one it's fading already. Besides that, I liked them very much"
4.0,"Needed a small container for reading glasses. Not leather, but it protects reading glasses and the half frame size fits store bought glasses."
4.0,Nice dress. Fits nice.
4.0,it's so cute and I love the pink frosting!!! Too bad it isn't real silver as I would have rated it even higher.
4.0,"Love Bape brand so this iwas a must along with the other durag I could find on here! Well..its constructed quite well! Satin type material on the outside, silky base material I side! I usually dont like that particular build, but it was executed well on this rag. Sculpts to the shape of my head snuggly. Creating good compression when wolfing.<br />My only real gripe is the design seems off. The straps cover parts of the shark eyes, and the teeth are relatively unseen when tied! Disappointed, but expected from the looks of the ad!"
4.0,Not going to lie I thought the pentacle was going to be a little bit more quality than that. But I do love the stone and the stares I get from wearing it so I guess I‚Äôll give you a 4 star.
4.0,"I like the fit and feel of this maxi dress! It's a smidgen too long, but I can make it work!"
4.0,I had this watch back in 1999 i was happy good watch
4.0,The description says women's super sock but it is actually a men's size and sock.  So it is confusing to actually purchase.  Also the sock pictured has a different top design than the actual sock I received.  I'm hopeful that this new sock will wear as well as the old ones.
4.0,"I really like this dress! It has a faux wrap style, but isn‚Äôt in danger of coming open. The material is a good quality, color as pictured. I have washed it several times and haven‚Äôt had any issues with fading. My only issue with it is the wrap bit on the skirt cuts up a little high for me, but that is 100% just a personal insecurity. Size was accurate as well"
4.0,This band has both the clips and the watch band it's a great idea
4.0,I gave it a four star bcuz the color is darker than it appears on the site. However it's of great quality.
4.0,"Just got them, haven't ridden in them.  I am 6' tall, 37"" waist, 208 lbs.  During the cycling season, currently, I'm closer to 36"".  I ordered the XL.  Yes, the pad in the rear feels a bit big, but again this is a product at less than half the cost.  They fit well otherwise.  I'll repost after a ride or two.<br /><br />Update...15 mile ride..pad felt a bit bulky,but warm on the legs, we shall see if a few rides flattens the padding a bit.  Still 4 stars, but only because it was cheap. I won't be buying another pair."
4.0,Very pretty.  But broke and all the beads spilled after 6 months.
4.0,Love the open lower back part of this dress
4.0,"COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE ROOMY BUT I LOVE HOW IT LOOKS.  VERY SEXY!  QUALITY PRODUCT, WELL PACKAGED, QUICKLY SHIPPED."
4.0,Great Quality But Fit Tight...Very Shear if your comfortable with that.. Very Sexy Bikini 4 pack
4.0,Ok but would not buy again
4.0,Cute and well made product. The sizing is a bit large for 4 and 5 year old children.
4.0,"I really like my goggles, but I can't wear them so I also got a top hate and just put the goggles around the hat. Sadly, the ones I have are not the ones in the picture (with the kind of face mask), mine have just the goggle part and the strap. I think the face mask part would have made them easier to wear but much harder to put on a hat."
4.0,"Soooo small. The necklace is really difficult to put on. You can't see what the cut/design is because it is very, very small. I haven't taken it off! Not because it's a fantastic necklace, but because I'm afraid I won't be able to put it again. The closure is super  difficult to manipulate. Won't buy again."
4.0,Good for light shopping.
4.0,"Boxer briefs are comfortable, just shorter in length than my boys prefer. Overall, good value and quality."
4.0,Pretty and fits well.  Fabric is slick though. Probably will still wear it.
4.0,"First off, expectations were low because at the time of purchase this dress was only $5.99 on prime. I ordered a large and the dress also is like a felt/velvet but more rough so definitely leaning towards the felt side. To my surprise this turned out cuteeeeeeeee! The fabric and slight ruching makes it perfect so no shape wear is needed. Boobs fit comfortably with no bra, it would take some serious ass throwing for a tit to pop out the middle. The slit was a great addition to add some sexiness. Length is a little long (past my knees if totally unruched) but still a great choice for those chillier nights."
4.0,"It is cute but a little quirky looking -- definitely a 1950s, Mad Men vibe except the skirt is a tad short and full, so it comes off more as The Jetsons than Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Got it for homecoming for my 16-year-old and she liked it, but not as much as another one we ordered from Amazon.  Pockets are definitely a bonus.  The lace-up back looks cute, but is a pain to do the first time and could definitely be a problem if you are getting dressed alone -- not as simple as asking someone you don't know to zip you up -- picture Scarlett O'Hara without anyone to pull her corset strings -- this is not a DIY job.  Pro-tips: start from the bottom so the bow you finish with is at the top, and VERy loosely lace it before slipping it on."
4.0,These are cute but definitely need to be worn with a long shirt to hide the waist.  As the name implies they are really comfy.  I just cant decide how I feel about pull on jeans.
4.0,"Something that should be tried on before buying, however; good quality and silky smooth. One tie inside and one outside"
4.0,"I got these to walk the dog so I wouldn't ruin my formal gloves. These have a nice grip for my phone and the leash and leave some room in the tip for my not very long nails. BUT I was really hoping to find some like this for women. The fingers are a bit too wide for my liking and I feel that the glove doesn't ""fit like a glove"" on me. Warm and functional though."
4.0,"I like them. They are pretty warm for leggings and work well for me. However, where i live it does not snow so I am unsure how they will work in real winter weather. I asked my husband if they were see through and he said they weren't. However, I do wear them with a sweater dress or with longer shirts.<br /><br />I will update if they break as I have worn them about 3 times each and still look fine. I wash them in delicate cycle with whoolite and hang dry and have not experienced shrinking of the fabric."
4.0,"I wanted a pair of polarized sunglasses that were inexpensive, as I lost the last really good pair I purchased. These fit the bill.  They are very inexpensive but they have a decent fit and fairly good polarization.  The $200 sunglasses are much better but these are perfectly adequate."
4.0,Loved this dress!  Very flattering.
4.0,I honestly wasn't expecting much after reading the other reviews but when I got it I was surprised. It is s beautiful ring and yes the black wears off from them rubbing together. The only real issue I had with them is one if the runs didn't have a complete sterling silver stamp on the inside of the band.
4.0,"very cute and actually ordered another so I cold have a set.  Although 2 are photographed, only one is shipped."
4.0,"Loved how tight they are, but the waist is loose"
4.0,"Falls out when you remove the mask.  Something else to keep up with.  Otherwise,  it works great! Makes breathing a lot easier!"
4.0,"Quality is pretty good, delivery is faster than I expected.<br />The colour is slightly different from the pic, but still allowable."
4.0,I'm glad I found a pendant I like but I dunno if it will stand up to long wear and use because the gold ribbing on the ends is looking to me like it is coming off.
4.0,Some of your items are way too big and this is one of them.
4.0,ID enclosure tore easily
4.0,I wish it had more pink. I am trying to decide if I should order another to see if it would have more pink on it and return the one that doesn‚Äôt.
4.0,"Although the slippers are very cute and soft, they look mismatched. The pattern and coloration are very different."
4.0,Needs a shoulder strap
4.0,The suit arrived as expected and in great condition. It looks just as nice as I thought. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because the size was too large for me. Plan to try another size.
4.0,"The boot looks great; however it doesn‚Äôt stay up. If I wear a long sock underneath, it helps to stay up a little bit longer. Then it goes when you walk again. Although, it doesn‚Äôt up like it supposed to, I still like it. The boot fits to its true size."
4.0,Cute summer dress for a great price!
4.0,Great fit! I'm a 34 in. waist and it would fit up to a 37 in. waist I'd say!<br />The price is great for what you are getting. It's simple and comfortable.
4.0,I changed sizes from 3xl to class and still huge. Beware of sizing. Stick to your normal size. All run big. May not purchase from them again. I should have stuck to a large but I'm too exhausted to keep sending them back.
4.0,"Quality is good but not great. I'm not crazy about the waistband or leg bands, which bind a little. I prefer the weight and bands of Jockey brand."
4.0,"I absolutely love these. They are tinted perfectly and very cute. I took away one star only because they are really very big and I think they'd look better if they were a shade (no pun intended, or was it üòÖ) smaller."
4.0,Super cute .<br />Had a low v neck
4.0,wish the shirts were longer and a little tighter around the waist.  But you definitely get looks in the gym if you got some cut to you.
4.0,"Very good fit. I am 5'7'' and 115 pounds. It was not too loose in the chest area. It was a bit snug in the rear. I can wear it okay, but it may start to ride up. I ordered a medium. I am curious if the large would be too big. I guess I am just a bit too tall for this to fit less snuggly. Nice suit. My husband liked it on me."
4.0,"I bought this dress after reading the reviews and therefore knew I needed to order it in X-large. It arrived 13 days after the order was placed which was sooner than I expected. The seller sent me a very cute handwritten note which I was grateful for because I appreciate small things like these. I am a 36 D so I knew that it might have been tight at the top. It was not that tight and completely wearable. I know what some people mean about the length but its actually just the style of the dress. The sides are shorter than the front and the back and if you look at the dress on the hanger on the picture, it looks the same. I wore this dress for a New Year party and everyone loved it. The material was also very comfortable. So for measurements so you can have a good idea of what size to buy, bust 36D, height 5'5 and weight, about 148Lbs. Hope this is helpful."
4.0,"Not crazy about all of the thread loops on the inside of these socks. Easy to catch on when putting them on. That said, they fit well and feel good on my feet. But if you want similar inside/outside sock surfaces, these would not be for you."
4.0,Great styling ans quality for the price.  Fits a little large but otherwise its a good buy!
4.0,This was pretty and very sparkly. However I returned it because it was just too thick and gaudy for me. But the quality was nice if you like chunky jewelry.
4.0,"I have been searching for a motorcycle charm for my Origami Owl locket and came across this one.  It fits in my locket perfectly but I had thought it would be a little bigger than what it actually is.  None the less, it is cute and I really like it."
4.0,I really like my silicone ring that I bought to wear to work. My wedding ring is a 6.5 so I bought a 6.5 in the silicone ring and it fits a little tight on me. I would maybe recommend going up the next half size.
4.0,Everyone love it.
4.0,This is a beautiful ring. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the fact that it is easily adjustable makes it suspectible to breaking. Mine hasn't broken but from previous rings of similar style I know the sterling will break if adjusted too much.
4.0,"The dress is perfect to size.I am 5&#34;4 and weigh 199 ,I got a size L and it was perfect with room. Received alot of compliments when I wore it to church.Very stretchy material.Very vibrant colors."
4.0,Nice little summer top well worth getting
4.0,"Nice jeans, but were too big for my husband."
4.0,"These were my favorites for like two years, however, each time I ordered some at least one pair had a run/tear in them and tears/unravels happens in the waist bands after a while. Some I have had for 2 years but others I had to through out after only a month or two. Depends on when/if they developed tears. The material is soft, but prone to tears, and the material doesn't  provide adequate adhesion for pads or panty liners - they just peel off after the material moves/stretches."
4.0,Gorgeous! Compliments the first day I wore it. Looks authentic for costume jewelry. Bling!
4.0,"Authentic ‚Äî silver stamp clearly marked on back of each earring. These earrings are smaller than I anticipated. That said, the level of detail is outstanding. It makes the size dainty and demure though exquisite ‚Äî like RBG!"
4.0,"Paint scratches off fast, I would recommend the clear ones or the stainless steal watches."
4.0,Size s fit my regular size 2 body very well. I am 5‚Äô6 and 128lbs
4.0,"I ordered a medium,  I am about 5‚Äô4‚Äù, weigh134 pounds, the medium fits fine, but if you want a roomie fit size up!"
4.0,"Bonito dise√±o pero no abriga, esta bien para un clima fr√≠o pero no para nieve."
4.0,great gloves but not really LARGE  more Medium size
4.0,"The joggers are super cute., they fit great and I would definitely purchase them again. I expected the joggers to be thicker than they are, I would not classify them as a late fall or winter type pant.  They are great for spring, early summer or  early fall."
4.0,Love the hats but I think they run big. The size is for 6-12 and my daughter is 7 months but the hat's are slightly big. The blue hat is made of a softer jean material and has straps with velcro at the end. Being that it's slightly big I'm tying the strings until it becomes more fitted. The white hat probably won't fit my daughter until she's about 10 months. They're very cute though. I will update when she's uses them outdoors. Also the white hat doesn't have much of a shape.
4.0,"a bit difficult to stay on your ear, but beautiful"
4.0,The material on this top is very soft and I like that there are not seams at the shoulders. The V-neck doesn't go too low.<br /><br />This is a slightly more form fitting shirt than others so depending on how flowy you want it you might want to size up 1.<br /><br />Since it is light weight it will be perfect for summers in the south.
4.0,"I tried this item out with ‚Äòtry before you buy‚Äô and loved it except it had a damaged area where threads were pulled out, right along the neckline. I sent it back as damaged and purchased a new one and received it as the other one was on the way back.<br />I couldn‚Äôt believe that it showed up damaged in the exact same place. It must be a flaw at the factory but they haven‚Äôt noticed it yet.<br />Luckily, the damage was not as bad on this one so I used my sewing kit to try to fix it because I like this turtleneck."
4.0,I love it except there is a spot on the inside of the lense. Is there a way to take it apart to clean the smudge? Otherwise it's great!
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace, but it would probably be appropriate for older women. It is very large. I'll be returning it, if I can figure out how...no packing slip or return postage sticker."
4.0,Lots of loose string hanging off shirt but fits very well shorts are long a little past the knee
4.0,These are so adorable and I would have given 5 stars it most of the roses on the necklaces and bracelets hasn‚Äôt fell off. We can Glue them back in but it was disappointing how they were either off in the package already or fell off within a day.
4.0,It's nice looking but will break if you drop it.
4.0,"Very nice quality embroidered dress.  I‚Äôm not sure I agree with all the reviewers saying to go up a size - this leaves a lot of space in the bust area so unless you are very well endowed going up a size causes it to gape in front.  Research will tell you that a dirndl is supposed to fit very tight almost like a corset.  Be prepared to iron or steam the apron and blouse, they come very wrinkled.  The blouse is made of a very stiff & unflattering cotton.  They needed to add some stretch to the fabric.  Also it doesn‚Äôt give you the nice cleavage you want with a dirndl, it‚Äôs too covered up. I recommend purchasing a separate blouse.  The blouse pictured in my photos is not the one that came with the set."
4.0,"Really cute, but a little wide for my face- probably made to fit a larger size face or &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  Lens popped out first day and a few times since but i was able to wedge it back in. Average quality, but item appears exactly as pictured."
4.0,"This shirt is VERY flattering. The cut makes me look trim and fit. The only reason why I don't LOVE it is the little bubble that sits on the shoulders. It makes me feel self-conscious, like I'm wearing shoulder pads. I wish it was a normal sleeve. Besides that, it's a great top."
4.0,"This bikini has nice padding in the top. The straps in the back were kind of short so instead of a typical bow tie, I have to tie a knot. The bottoms were pretty small. The quality of the material is alright, worse in the bottoms. Overall, good for a cheap bikini. Just order a size larger than your typical size."
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 135lb, athletic build, bra size 32D/34C. I ordered a size S, as I normally do, and the shirt fits well. It can feel a little tight across my shoulders in certain positions, but I am slightly broad shouldered. The fabric is comfortable and washes well."
4.0,Nice quality and really pretty.
4.0,"Book bag for my daughter.  Used for camp, still in great condition."
4.0,"This is a very useful little pack -- keyword: little.  My son thought it would be big enough to use as a school backpack, but it's not.  It is; however, the perfect size to wear for airplane travel, to carry on and have easy access to everything."
4.0,Its will be awesome for my neice
4.0,"I really like these military style watches. The retro sizing completes the look at only 36 mm in width.  The only knock is that the lugs are true military style, without a removable spring bar.  This would not be so much an issue except that the fixed lug is square, not rounded like a normal spring bar.  This means that band selection is limited to a relatively thin NATO style fabric strap.  This would look great with a two piece leather strap but you can't attach one.  The plus is that the lugs will likely never break and if they do,  the wearer will have more serious problems that losing a inexpensive watch.  A second hand in either red or orange would be an improvement too."
4.0,Only 1 scrapper & the rest are great. I don't trade these - only use them for myself to fill in my collection. Will buy again
4.0,Not shoes.just a tassle!
4.0,"A bit bigger than we expected, but my son loves to change his one earring out every day."
4.0,"Got these for my almost 4 year old. He loves them, says they're &#34;cool&#34;!"
4.0,"I purchased these for my teenage son, who sails every day. They are inexpensive enough to replace when lost and look great on!"
4.0,"I'm not super impressed by these. There's nothing amazing about them. They fit fine, but they're not insanely soft or anything. I could tell pretty quickly that the elastic waistband would wear our pretty quickly. I think I've had these on for less than 24 hours and they're already slipping.<br /><br />Update: The company has contacted me to tell me that they have taken my feedback and wanted to fix the situation. I was offered either a full refund or a second order free of charge. They have been professional and have had great customer service."
4.0,I liked these.  May be they are a little too expensive.  The color is great.
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Was somewhat smaller than I thought. Can't wait to wear them!
4.0,"This is the cutest sweater. I love everything about it. The v neck cut is so versatile as you can wear it normal or off the shoulder. The fabric is stretchy and the waffle knit is warm and comfortable. The only point I‚Äôm taking off is for it being a bit see through, but I just wore a cute bralette underneath and rocked it. It was perfect for my date night. :)<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram for all of my favorite outfits and looks! @amberlysheashea"
4.0,Okay for the price. Light weight.
4.0,"This vest is well.made,looks good and is confortable,the only reason i dont give it 5 stars is because sizes are way too small ,"
4.0,"Nice bag if u can look pass the faults. it doesn‚Äôt stand up, the sides slouch. Have used it twice and got sprinkled in the rain so now I see water spots on the bag the zip is half way sewn on. Arrived on time"
4.0,"The socks is very thin, offers little support, but I guess that is what you get for the price"
4.0,"Pretty cute, can't wait to wear it at the beach!"
4.0,"These are nice, soft and comfortable. I don‚Äôt love the pockets - they are patch which I don‚Äôt love but what I really dislike is they aren‚Äôt sturdy enough to hold my phone. They‚Äôre ok for around the house, but without my phone, I feel lost. I don‚Äôt like to carry a bag when I‚Äôm doing shorts so although these feel good and actually look good, they‚Äôll probably end up for around the house rather than going out."
4.0,They were too small for my kid but looked great.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Not bad for the price.
4.0,"Beautiful. After a while the skirt becomes poofy, but overall I loved it."
4.0,"Not bad for $10 earrings I must say. They are made of real stone and not molded plastic like a lot of trendy earrings that are priced similarly. Now, because of this, there will be natural variances in the veining, color, and in some cases, texture of each pair--even each earring. Totally normal and, I think, beautiful. What's funny is a bought these before going into Neimans Last Call where I found almost the exact same earrings but three times as much. So these are a good dupe for more expensive brands (yes, they do remind you of KS). I can't speak to the quality of the gold tone accent that surrounds the stone and the ear hook but it's very possible they could tarnish as an inexpensive metal. Shipping was quick and I am happy with this order!"
4.0,I was missing 2 but it come soon and most matched
4.0,These are nicely made but the spring action sides fit so snugly above my ears that I get a headache if worn too long.
4.0,The watch keeps good time. The only problem is that the band has very little adjustability.
4.0,Adorable. Just wish it had baby yoda on both sides of the earrings.
4.0,"Item arrived in expected time frame. The case is narrower and taller than my previous one, which works great to fit in my car's center console. It is also heavier than my previous case, and the blow-molded flocked insert so far seems to staying in place. My previous case was a free hard case from my glasses store. After two years, the blow-molded flocked insert tore at the crease point, where the hinges are, and proceeded to tear into the top and bottom sections. Needless to say, it bothered me. This case is a very nice upgrade."
4.0,"I got this for cosplay. I went off of reviews when selecting my size, which was a big mistake. People that had a similar cup size purchased a small with good results but I really needed a large according to the size chart. :/ there is very little give to the fabric, which I suppose could be good for compression, I'm not really sure.<br />I gifted it to a friend and it conceals her pretty well"
4.0,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and these insoles, which I have put in a pair of boots, have helped a great deal with my foot and leg pain."
4.0,"I love this product, and have been wearing it non stop since purchase. One thing to note on it is that the leather ties are a bit uncomfortable on your wrist but you can slightly modify it if desired."
4.0,This dress is very nice just be sure to order an extra size bigger than you actually need and then keep in mind it took it for weeks to get here
4.0,"I probably didn't read the description fully but though this shirt looks like it's cotton, it's not. Has a wider fit and the shirt itself is a little short. Had to be tucked in to high pants/skirt or worn with undershirt. All in all I'm happy with it. Very light. Took about 3 weeks to get here."
4.0,"Love it. It's soft, perfect size and color with just enough slots/pockets. Glad I decided to purchase it!"
4.0,Wow! So big.
4.0,It's cute but not as nice as the hummingbird
4.0,nice heavy material<br />felt that it ran a little big
4.0,"Accurate sizing.  Nice detail on apron. Photo looked red/black, but it is actually Magenta/navy.  Very cute.  Be aware that the blouse is not separate. This is a one-piece dress with apron.  Looks great anyway!"
4.0,Pretty good buy. Ordered  XL based on ratings. Can wear it & has some stretch to it..
4.0,Really like the product
4.0,"Had to return as I was too large for it.  It is lovely, good quality fabric and very well-made."
4.0,Don‚Äôt find the quality of material use is worth the price . Just his print on a normal shirt .
4.0,"It will take some time to get used to the pressure around my eye sockets, otherwise, it worked as described, no leakage of pool water into the eye cup.  Easy to put on and take off."
4.0,I bought these for my friend and she seems to like them. They‚Äôre a little thinner than expected but they fit well and the color is nice
4.0,I like the style but it was so uncomfortable around my toes when I walked. I had them on for about 5 minutes and couldn't get past the fact that they are so tight in the front. Great design but not the greatest idea to wear them for a long period of time.
4.0,Too large. The straps were too stretchy. I loved the material but overal they did not fit. I loved the look of them though. The size is just not accurate to plus sized.
4.0,"I got this belt for my husband, who wear a 38 in jeans. This belt is exactly how it looks in the picture. very well made and good quality. But it was short on my husband. Not what I was expecting. Now, we will have to look for a suitable person to gift it to. Overall, the belt is good and looks durable as well, just not for us. I received this belt on discount price for an honest opinion."
4.0,Extremely comfortable!  Wore them all day the first time.  Wish they came in more colors.
4.0,"I give this a solid ""Good for the Price"". It is a very comfortable band, and looks great on my Alpinist. The Litchi leather has great texturing and the pictures in the listing are quite accurate.<br />But... those glue dots on the stitches definitely show where the cost cutting is compared to a more expensive band. The manufacturer claims that there is no way to make the band without the dots, but that statement should probably include ""for this price"". Choose your band color wisely, and most casual observers won't notice.<br />I'm also not a huge fan of the buckle design. I would have preferred the simpler buckle from the rally strap version."
4.0,I love these jeans; the denim is just the right weight. They run large. I wear a 16W and could have ordered a 14 W.
4.0,"This outfit fit wonderfully and was received quickly. I did order one size larger then normal. Fabric seems high quality, including the socks which are thick.<br />There are two reasons for 4 stars. Firstly,  I abhor the neck tie (in fact, I bought fabric to make a new one.) For some reason, it is the only cheap fabric and the edges were frayed. Secondly, there was a lot of stray threads. Normally when I purchase clothes, I do a seam check and clean them up, this took a little longer then normal. The seams themselves are secure and lined up well, though.<br />All in all, I am very happy with this purchase."
4.0,Liked it. Kinda cheaply made. But it's for just a few parties this Halloween. So it's just fine.
4.0,One of the best slim wallets I‚Äôve purchase.
4.0,"The band is very nice, but the lug spring pins are garbage. I experienced 4 times that pins popped out off lugs and band separated from watch."
4.0,It's great for its value
4.0,Like the product will keep but do not like zippers on the side prefer button up .
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this from those old enough to know what the heck it represents.  The material is soft and I like it.  I wish it was a little shorter maybe.  With having true waist to hip ratio, t shirts that are straight and a tad too long sort of get hung up on my hips and cling a bit tighter there which I don't love.  Overall, fun."
4.0,"It was packaged in such a way that it had a bump on the top that was hard to disguise. However it looked and felt like real hair- at least pretty good for something of this price. I ended up cutting it short and wearing a headpiece to disguise it‚Äôs wig-ness. Some people actually asked if i cut my hair which i thought was silly, i didnt think it was that convincing. But it matched my natural color very closely!"
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty but quite a bit bulkier than I thought with just my passport.
4.0,"I really like this for a comfortable around the house dress, but would dress up nicely, too. Be sure to use the size guide. Dress is a tad clingy in back and  snug at top, but you should be fine if you use their guide. The skirt is not as full as the other style on this site, so check the back picture to make sure you have the one you like."
4.0,Too light for winter.
4.0,I love swimsuit like this. I feel covered up but still it has style. The zipper broke after one use hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I will have it replaced because this is a nice swimsuit I'd like to wear again
4.0,I was looking for a slot to put my towel in but it does not have one. The cell phone holder fits snug to your thigh and does move
4.0,"Bought as an accessory to my kiddos costume, he LOVES it!! I was surprised at how bright the colors get and how loud it is. Audio is clear and after a couple dance sessions, I am ready for the batteries to die...but they are still going strong. A little spendy, but good quality makes it worth it."
4.0,"This top is pretty good overall but I don't like that the material is see through. I like how lightweight it is and that I don't get as sweaty when I workout in it. It's easy to tie in the back and it looks so cute! All in all, I like this tank for home workouts but it's not one that I'll be wearing to the public gym."
4.0,"Fit exactly as advertised, very pleased with the style it. I have long wavy hair and wearing hat's is always a drag, this let's me put all my hair inside without worrying about it creeping out or riding up."
4.0,"Like the style, but since I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù, a little too long"
4.0,Nice bracelet. Gave as a birthday gift
4.0,"Because of the stretch material, it is probably meant to be tight fitting."
4.0,"These glasses do just what they say and trust me, I did a lot of experimenting on them before I could drop a review.<br /><br />First and foremost, if you have children who love to stare at their tablets or the TV in the dark rooms for long periods of time, then these are the glasses to get. Start em while they're young! I have numerous comrades who wear glasses as a result of staring at a computer screen in the dark for long periods of time...causing permanent damage to their eyes.<br /><br />When putting them on, you don't notice the yellowish tint shield it applies till you go into a dark room and then look at your laptop, phone, or tablet, etc... The best comparison I could give is like turning on ""night shift"" on your iPhone, it's actually exactly like that.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the build quality on these glasses is not bad at all quite nice for the price. And that's always a plus. But be careful with the plastic surrounding the 2 lenses, a little too bendy for my liking. Another thing that there me off was the slightly unpleasant smell of these right out the box. Make sure to air them out a little.<br /><br />In all, if you're worried about your children's vision, these are a definite buy. But again, these WILL NOT fit adults unless you have a small head. So yea...Good Product. StaySaucy"
4.0,"Definitely a one size thing, a bit loose but I have very skinny wrists! Otherwise very cool!"
4.0,"This is a nice product, but was different than I was hoping for. I wanted something longer and scrunchable."
4.0,"For the price is the best purchase ever!!<br />Like the fit, the look is cool.(they look as more expensive sunglasses)<br />It take some time to arrive, but worth the wait.<br />Better is that they are available in different lenses color"
4.0,Helps with arthritis pain/swelling  in my hands
4.0,Red rose looks real. The pull out drawer has a crown ring and heart necklace. They are made of sturdy metal and the ring is adjustable. The chain is fairly thin with a lobster claw clasp. The color of the stone is supposed to be purple but appears black to me. It comes with a gift bag and card.
4.0,"I‚Äôve gotten many comments and compliments on these pants. Fits as expected, fits slim but not skinny, stretch material is very comfortable. Two rear pockets come sewn shut, I sewed on a button so they won‚Äôt become stretched out. Pocket lining feels strange but softens up after washing."
4.0,"I originally purchased these in a large and they fit but I thought they could be a little tighter, so I also purchased a medium and I LOVE these capris, which have now become my favorite in BOTH sizes. They're great for yoga or under a tunic for a dressy night out. After searching and searching, I finally found THE Capri for me!"
4.0,Nice but could be a little bit longer
4.0,Seems well built in very accurate.
4.0,I liked this charm i think it is cute
4.0,"I would have given this a 5 star if not for the sizing difference. I got these for someone that's a true medium. Because of reviews, I did go a size up. The large fits, but because the top bands thin, he said they flip down. Apparently the thick band ones don't. He said mid day it stretched, and it stopped flipping. It's underwear tho, and I want him to be comfertable all day. So make sure you look at the sizing chart. I'd advise you to size up."
4.0,Had to return. Was too small. Looked nice though.
4.0,"The pendant I got doesn't look exactly like the picture, but it is nice."
4.0,"Had a similar model that was a little larger.  Although sightly smaller in size, I like it."
4.0,"I wear these about an hour a day while walking my dog in the woods in the cold Upstate New York winter.  They make it so much more enjoyable-especially since my hand is frequently exposed when I'm reaching for a treat or picking up poop with a bare hand.  Slipping back into a nice warm mitten is awesome!  They are not super pliable so there isn't much dexterity but they're perfect for my needs.  I bought a size large because I like lots of room for my fingers to keep each other warm.  They make more sense than using an 8 hour HOT HANDS to keep my hands warm for an hour. So far I've used them for 5 days (hours) on a single charge.  I really like them so I hope they hold up .  If they don't, I'll update my review."
4.0,"Pretty pleased with it, though it is thinner than I anticipated. Does not hold a ton but a binder fits nicely."
4.0,"I like the bag very much! it looks just like the picture and both my nook and my ipad fit into the pocket in the bag (not together, just either one) well.  I didn't realize the bag is not &#34;regular&#34; cloth.  But it works well to be able to wipe it off and also in the summer we get a lot of rain in Florida so I don't have to worry about my bag (or the things in it) getting all wet."
4.0,"These are by no means the same quality as more expensive capris as advertised by the seller. But they are a bargain for the price. The fabric is a bit stiff but that should work itself out after a few washes. Not see through, which is great as most inexpensive work out bottoms are."
4.0,"Love this! The material and and length is great, i afore the top and arms of this. Although, slightly looks maternity/moomoo on me. A belt helped a bit."
4.0,"The sweater is warm, comfortable and good looking... but the zipper is third rate. It is very flimsy, and I am probably going to have to replace it."
4.0,Very Cool!!!!  Better than I expected!!!  Unique!!
4.0,"There's a few loose threads on the embroidery, but other than that it's a nice fitting & looking shirt. Fits pretty true to a women's fitted t-shirt size. It hugs but doesn't cling."
4.0,The frame was nice and good quality
4.0,I like the top and as far as the fit goes I would say it is true to size. Only downside for me and this is with most tops is I find it shorter than I'd like. I am 5'10&#34;
4.0,"This was a gift and receiver was happy, shoes are comfortable. Thanks"
4.0,"As the other reviews said, these are pretty short if your taller than 5‚Äô10. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù 200 lbs with a 32‚Äù waist. I ordered large and it fits well except the length comes down to my waist or barely below. It‚Äôs still wearable but could definitely use 2-3 more inches of length. If you have a gut at all you should probably pass on these."
4.0,The mask came in 2 weeks earlier which was very convenient since I had to attend a convention within that time slot. The mask was really well crafted and honestly impressed me by how accurate it looked. My only gripe is that it was uncomfortable keeping on since the strap was a little too tight and the mask felt uneasy on my face after a couple of minutes of wearing it. I still recommend for the authenticity but it may feel uncomfortable after a while.
4.0,"It came much earlier than expected, (wich is a good thing) But they are much smaller than I thought, they are smaller than a dime. Other than that they are in great condition."
4.0,"Perfect tiny size that I was looking for.  Bends with ease. Does not sit high at all.  I knew it said colors vary and I took a chance but I wish it came with more clear ones.  There were 4 blue, 4 pink and 2 clear,  The other colors were 2 each."
4.0,They are beautiful but they come without backs?  That was strange.
4.0,Seller was awesome in reaching out and clarifying washing instructions.
4.0,"It‚Äôs more of a burnt orange than a brown. It also fits just a little funny- there‚Äôs an odd pseudo-flare at the back bottom hem, but this could be a body shape thing and not a skirt-quality thing. Snaps go all the way up. It‚Äôs also not as ‚Äúmini‚Äù as the pic shows- I can wear it just under my belly button and it passes the ‚Äúfingertip rule.‚Äù Fabric is SUPER soft and feels very high quality, just some minor fitting and coloring issues but overall a keeper."
4.0,"I really like these pants. I've been having the issue of trying to get affordable pants that don't look like tights, which are not allowed in my office dress code. Good price and good fit. I'm 5'3 and 125lbs., size Medium fit perfect. I bought a pair in every color they offered. Soft, stretchy, and fitted but still look like pants that are appropriate for work.<br /><br />Update: I bought the black pinstripe pant, they are described as the Straight Leg Trouser but are yoga pants with pockets. These are not appropriate for a professional work environment. Sending back."
4.0,"I am 5'7"" and wear a 2x in Walmart sizes. I ordered a 3x from other people's reviews and it was spot on. It is the exact length I wanted, below the knee but not quite midcalf.<br />The fabric is a bit weird and gives me upholstery or Grandma's curtains vibes, but it doesn't affect the wear of it."
4.0,Fits well great snaps...All good so far..
4.0,Nice watch.  Hinges somewhat weak.
4.0,"These slippers are very cute and will keep your toes warm. They are a little silly, but fun."
4.0,These are comfy and the pockets are wonderful! The waist doesn‚Äôt come up very high though so the tummy control isn‚Äôt really effective.
4.0,Love the colour. It's too big for the child now but he will grow into it
4.0,"Caps a little too big but overall it's a good pickup, packaging was good. Definitely going to pick more colors soon."
4.0,"The bathing suit is very cute, I love the color! But the straps fall down easily, my nipple kept showing while at the beach üôÉ"
4.0,"I like it the style is great, perfect size too. My only complaint is that there were a lot of loose strings at the seams and where the zippers are, they get snagged easily."
4.0,"I got these last minute before my summer travels and I love them. The patterns are vibrant, the stitching looks sufficient. 3 out of 4 are roughly the same size, though the sleeves are 3/4 length when the pictures made it seem full-length (sunburn here I come!). The 4th is substantially shorter in length and smaller in size. I'm a 2X generally and 3 out of 4 were generous and flowy, but the 4th looked like it was made for Asian sizing. One size certainly doesn't fit all! I'm going to keep them as I just drape them over and don't need to close them, but as with Amazon clothing, you never know what you're going to get!"
4.0,Ordered an XL but received a xxl. A bit large but I love it anyways and will wear.
4.0,Nice but runs very small
4.0,I don't recommend. I just received the watch yesterday and the strap the actual watch band goes through broke already. It is a nice looking watch but not very well made. However they did get in touch with me and refunded me and sent me a watch for free.
4.0,"I am usually a size small in tops and bottoms and bought size large to be on the safe side from what the description says. The top fits just right but the pants is a bit too tight on me, I wore it for a week hoping that it will stretch with time. I recommend to go up at least 3 sizes"
4.0,Very light but causes a lot of static electricity otherwise great value
4.0,"easy to use, and it works well."
4.0,"I ordered a size M in Blue.  At 5'6&#34; and 135 pounds it fits perfectly.  I wanted this as a swimsuit cover up to wear on a trip to Cancun.  This is a $7 dollar dress and is fine to wear to the beach or in a casual bar as a cover up.  I gave it 4 stars because of the color.  I ordered Blue and the package says that it is Blue but it is really a pastel mint Green.  It is fine for what I ordered it for, not to thin and I think it would be fine to wear into a casual restaurant."
4.0,"It boxy, color is a little off but it‚Äôs cute i am a 32C and it‚Äôs  tight on the chest when i zip it up so i don‚Äôt.  The inside is loose so when i put it on the lining bunches up.  But it‚Äôs fine for the amount i paid for it."
4.0,"these are lightweight, and the polarization on the lens seems to be good. frame is flimsy, I purchased these for 13 dollars. which is about what this type of sunglass retails in others store like Target.<br /><br />After one month of wearing these, I am a lot happier than when I got them. I sweat like crazy, and other sunglasses the soft rubber usually disintegrates quickly. these have held up and has surprised me.<br />the polarization is good, and the frame is pretty tough. after using these for road biking and putting on a couple hundred miles, I am upgrading to 4 stars."
4.0,"Purchased without the inner lining. Big mistake, but leather is very nice and plan to keep."
4.0,Very cute and quite comfortable.  It slides down off my nose if I talk though. But fine for quick in store visits.
4.0,Gave this as a gift.
4.0,Looked nice but was way too small and had to return it
4.0,The dress is as described. It is a bodycon dress so it hugs your curves. I don't know how some of the women in the pictures got in this dress!! Im a 1X usually a 16/18 in clothing. I wish there was a 2X because it would have been perfect! One more thing...as it stretches the color fades especially the black. It turns grayish!!
4.0,Hat is definitely of a better quality than I assumed by looking at the pictures. Perfect for cookouts and a day at the beach.
4.0,Super cute shoes. Very nicely made. Just a tad wide for my skinny girls feet.
4.0,"Cool watch. Looks great, but has cheap piece thats locks in watch"
4.0,I rather enjoyed the sports sunglasses.  No complaints.
4.0,I loved how it felt a little to short for me but the only thing I did not like about it was it was to tight around my waist and arms so maybe go a size up when you buy it
4.0,These fit a little snug but they are great for driving in the rain or in the dark. They definitely help cut the glare.
4.0,nice quality and fit
4.0,Great tones and fit.<br />Only thing is the<br />detail is not so clear.<br />Will last a long time.<br />Great for the price.<br />Thanks.
4.0,Leg length is a bit long but pants are lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,they look very nice and classy. might be a bit small but they still fit me (0g).<br /><br />These are now my normal every day plugs.
4.0,It looks really good! üòãMy husband said he really liked it on me and can‚Äôt wait for me to wear it on our trip! üòç
4.0,"As I said in other reviews, I have six or seven of these Duke Nicle watches and they are beautiful and work great.  I'me very happy with my purchases!"
4.0,"Pros: if you got curves, this is your dress<br />Cons: the chest is a little loose could have used double sided tape; it kept riding up from the bottom.<br /><br />Overall: great dress and I got lots of compliments!<br /><br />36D. 5‚Äô3 and 150. I got a medium."
4.0,"They are well made! Fast shipping and a nice weight t shirt, not see through or too thin. Loved that my husband and I could get in the spirit since I thought of this very last minute üéÑ‚òÉÔ∏è I ordered a Large, I'm 5'2 , a little long on me but I tucked it in for pics. I got my hubs the xxl, it got the job done. He's 5'10, 180"
4.0,"The leather is great but the hardware is subpar. The velvet lining isn‚Äôt that desirable. Overall, a great product for the price!"
4.0,A little thinner than I thought they would be .... but I still like<br />them.
4.0,"I love it! It looks great on my nose and it stays on pretty nicely, I barely even notice it's there. The gems are just adorable too! I like the black the greatest but that's just my personal opinion. Now the gems screw in nicely and don't just randomly pop out so that's nice, not having to worry about if your jewelry is missing. Now, the picture makes it look bigger but it's not that big. All four of the gems do come with it. The shipping with this was nice and fast, it came quickly in the mail and I wanna say that I am glad I bought this piece of jewelry. If you're looking to get your nose pierced but aren't sure, I recommend getting this, it will help you decide. :)"
4.0,"I really wanted this crewneck and was excited to get it, however, it does run a bit large so I'm going to ask to exchange it."
4.0,Really cute dress but bigger than size usually is.
4.0,"This is a great find. My daughter who is 11 needed this too fill out a Halloween dress in a 50's style. It came and does a cute little job. The only thing is that the waist is a little small, but still closes. She is a very slender 11 so I would say, unless your child is also very thin, don't buy above nine or ten years."
4.0,"Very thin, very sexy coverup!"
4.0,"Love this. Great design, light weight, stylish and quick delivery."
4.0,It was a little difficult to pull over his head and arms but it fit well. He said it‚Äôs feels so soft and like a hug. He only takes it off to shower. He is 6 with autism.
4.0,"Got it for my wife's birthday. She loves Natasha and Yelena and it was the first Marvel movie we saw together. The pin is placed higher up on the back so it hangs down, probably so it doesn't just spin it around. Smooth, low profile, good product."
4.0,"Overall the dress is great. It fits great and once I can get it on, it looks great and is comfortable. I deducted one star because it‚Äôs a side zip instead of a back zip so I have to pull it over my head which I don‚Äôt like.  If I had noticed that before I bought it I would have looked for something similar with a back zip. But I‚Äôm not going to go thru the hassle of returning it because it is a good dress. As long as you don‚Äôt mind pulling it over your head, it‚Äôs the perfect dress."
4.0,Handle breaks off easily.
4.0,very cute but super see through have to wear something underneath
4.0,I just received this bag. Omg! I love Love Love it! The leather is buttery smooth. The bag is just the right size for all of my stuff. It came with the tag.<br />  The reason for taking away a star for a 5 star bag is that it didn‚Äôt come with the coach dust bag. Kinda bummed about that. Overall it‚Äôs a beautiful bag and I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a coach bag and don‚Äôt want to have to take out a second mortgage for one. I have enclosed pix üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
4.0,"You will want to wear something like a sock hat, baseball cap, head band because the strap digs into your head"
4.0,"Wife says it runs a bit small, but still fits.  Probably could have used a size larger than her normal.  She also reports that the pads inside do not need adjusting,  which seems to be a constant issue with sports bras."
4.0,"The dress is pretty true to size and the waist has elasticity which I love. The material has a light shine but the material is nice and light. The pockets arrived with holes but that seems like an easy enough fix, all the other seams feel pretty solid on a tug test."
4.0,"This long-sleeve tee feels great. I like the fit, like the weight, like the breathability.  The only thing I feel could be improved on is the sleeve cuff."
4.0,Looks good but feels heavy. Bought them for my daughters 100th day of school. She didn‚Äôt complain but I thought they were unnecessarily heavy.
4.0,"I love the look of these once I get them to stay put. Not sure about others, but I had to sort of give them a pinch to make them sit where I wanted, which was a little uncomfortable at times. I bought these and the more triangular style in silver, and these are my favorite of the two. Definitely a cute, subtle accent that looks good with anything! I would buy again."
4.0,"The benefits of a regular smart watch include accurate time, handy notifications, and of course the ability to add new features with software instead of purchasing a new watch. This hybrid smartwatch is interesting because on the one hand it has a fixed mechanical face (it is NOT a digital display). Although digital displays are pretty nice, they still come on and off and consume battery constantly. That may be a negative for some people that want to change the look of their watch often.<br /><br />Although the display is mechanical, this watch includes an activity tracker that tracks footsteps/motion which syncs via Bluetooth. I'm not sure how important this is because if you carry your cell phone all day, it also includes an activity tracker. For me I do like that it is tracking my steps even when I don't have my cell phone such as when I place it in my vehicle and am loading/unloading, on a call with Bluetooth headset (and phone is on the desk), etc.<br /><br />The watch can be configured with the Skagen cell phone application (in my case I used/tested with Android) to move the minute and second hand to any location when certain (configurable) notifications arrive. For example, I configured mine to move both hands to 12 position for message from my wife, 1pm for message from 1st kid, 2pm for second kid, etc. You can also configure it to give motion or sound/vibrate notifications for things like emails, social media events, IFTT events, basically -- most events that can pop-up on your cell phone screen can be notifications that can be translated to a mechanical position, vibration, and sound. I used all position and vibration as I don't want the sound.<br /><br />In fact the times I most like having a watch are the times when I would have my phone mutued and don't want a ringer such as at a meal time, at church, or in a meeting. For this the watch is extremely helpful. Likewise I like having it in the kitchen, where I much prefer not to have an expensive cell phone next to food and liquids.<br /><br />The downsides are the weight and size. It is huge like a smartwatch. Not at all slim -- and heavy. I'm not used to wearing a watch except for special occasions, but I'm giving it a new try with this watch. I'm not convinced I'll stay with it because it is yet another task to add (put on / take off) and another item to clean and care for which I don't love.<br /><br />But when I'm outdoors, walking, in the kitchen, in a meeting (f2f), or other places when I don't want a phone out, it is still helpful to have the time and the benefit of notices without having to open the phone. An added benefit is that I have my phone configured to stay unlocked when paired with the watch so I'm not unlocking my phone as often."
4.0,"This cover up is a great fit for what it is for. Very see through but the colors are pigmented well. True representation of the picture, except of course in the picture the waistline is pulled back a bit. Truly it is a straight drop not figure curvy, but it does its job."
4.0,"Instructions for these products are to use generously at bedtime and in the morning. I‚Äôve done this for 5 days and feel the container emptying quickly. This product if used over an extended period of time may provide long-lasting results but the product is currently unavailable and may not be restocked. I love the smell, the emulsion, and how my hands/feet feel after using product. Sad that it may never be available again."
4.0,Well it‚Äôs obvioisly cheaply made but it still looks pretty dang good for the price. I would say the color is a lot closer to rose than gold on the rose-gold spectrum. Otherwise a good buy!
4.0,It was beautiful and very classy.
4.0,"I liked the delivery time, but it did not match the blanket I ordered. She was happy so I am happy."
4.0,"Colors perfect. Metallic print perfect. Material very thin and only slightly stretchy. Ordered these in a size small for my friend and a medium for me. She is 110lbs super thin legs, tiny bottom and five foot three. Small will fit her. I am 126lb five foot two cross fit build with huge thighs. The medium fit my legs but baggy in the waist and crotch. Small should fit anyone 120lbs or less. Length is long no worries tall girls.  Medium will fit anyone up to 140lbs or anyone small with thick thighs or a booty. Waist is forgiving stretches plenty."
4.0,Cute. The base is bigger than I imagined but hey still cute!
4.0,"True color but the belt fit was a little high and did not flatter my shape. Returned this one. Homeyee dress quality is very good, I like the fabrics."
4.0,Took two weeks to get product but was as expected.
4.0,I use it for lounging with family. I did not follow their size recommendations because I  don't order my hoodies the same size as my shirts. I literally want it to be bigger and fit over whatever clothing so I always go up a size.
4.0,I am 5'10 195lbs. Pear shaped and I'm a 36B. The bottoms fit perfectly. The top was big in the cups but I'm sure I can fix that with some extra padding. The strap around the neck was too tight. Shipping was fast and the price is great!
4.0,"Comfortable but a little small. Good fabric, good q"
4.0,Good material.Alittle snug with my braids
4.0,"Pretty pattern, comfortable, seems decent quality, heavier material...not sure if I will keep it, only because it is slightly looser around my waist than I would like"
4.0,"Love this purse! The color<br />(coffee brown).some said it smelt bad but mine doesn't. LOTS of room. If you are looking for a small purse, this isn't it. It has so much room in it. , but I was worried it was going to be big like a duffel bag, but it isn't. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because there are some "" wrinkles"" on the back of the purse I have figured out how to get them out. Maybe they will go away the more I use it. So glad I ordered this purse."
4.0,Thin and comfortable. True test will come when the lake warms up and I can get in the water with them
4.0,"I really liked this shirt. It fit as I expected. I am a medium and bought a medium. I would suggest if you have bigger breasts to buy a size up though. I wear a 36 B and the shirt fit well. I am also 5'11 and worried about it being more of a bandue than a crop top but it came to about an inch above my belly button (if that, I'm guesstimating)"
4.0,My 16 year old son really liked this necklace
4.0,Great deal on these! Assembling does require watching a few youtube videos.
4.0,"No certification , and  the weight is 5 gm not 5.6 as described"
4.0,DRESS IS NICE.  THE MATERIAL WASN'T COTTON AS I WAS EXPECTING. IT WAS LITTLE KIND OF WEIRD POLYESTER (I THINK). IT IS DEFINITELY A CUTE DRESS THOUGH.  THE PRICE MADE IT EVEN BETTER.  I GOT THE DRESS FOR $9.99!!!!
4.0,The shirt was wider than long and you should order the shirt a size larger than you normally wear.
4.0,"Nice, light, summer coverup."
4.0,I bought my daughter this mother daughter braclet because she likes this style.  I liked it and so did she
4.0,Why is the sleeves are never proportional with the rest of the pants? So far this is the only thing what I don‚Äôt like. I like to wear it for shopping but after I have to wash because I dragged the junk with my pants home
4.0,"Heavy, great detail, perfect size, love it. My only complaint is that I wish they let me choose the necklace length. 18 inches is too short for a pendant this bulky. I ended up buying a 22 inch chain to replace the one it came with."
4.0,I've owned these before and love them especially when I travel by plane or long drives in the car. great support.  only negative comment is the toes are a little weak and will wear through.
4.0,so far so good the material is quite stretchy and fit my sister perfectly
4.0,It certainly does not stretch up to 11.9 inches. The picture shows the woman wearing it on her bicep- that‚Äôs the biggest misrepresentation of size I‚Äôve ever seen. My daughter can‚Äôt even wear it on her forearm. But it is soft and cute.
4.0,Take the American flag wherever you go. Very nice and modern.  Also a good protection for your eyes! try it on.
4.0,I'm pretty sure it is not real leather. I like the purse style and smaller size. I ordered red. As you can see next to my other red purse it looks brown. Seems to be well made! Tight fit for my phone but I think as it wears it will loosen up.
4.0,Butt looks a little flat
4.0,I love the skirt but it is not very flattering on me unfortunately I am short waisted and short so it‚Äôs just not the best fit for me but I love the pattern stretchy waistband and it feels like quality material!
4.0,"The fit was fine, but the color was not as depicted, it was cherry red as opposed to rust-red. But, it was inexpensive and washed well."
4.0,These are actually pretty good for the price. They are thinner than I would have hoped for but overall nice. The one thing is they are all different sizes not sure if this just happened to me but I ordered a small and if I line them up on top of one another some are bigger then others. Hasn‚Äôt seems to be much of a problem. Nice colors and comfortable. Would buy again.
4.0,"nice XXL hoodie, but potential buyers should know that the Motorhead logo itself including the &#34;Motorhead&#34; name and &#34;England&#34; are much smaller than they appear in the photo. it almost feels like they grabbed a comfy generic (black) hoodie and steam pressed the logo on it just prior to sending. overall, it's a comfortable, good-looking hoodie but for 60 bones, they should sell what they advertise"
4.0,"Very cute hat, but a little large.  I had expected to receive a &#34;internal band&#34; to adjust the fit, but it was not included."
4.0,I would have given this 5 stars except on of the underwaer in each pack was two sizes larger than the size  I order that was on the package and that was on each of the underwear.
4.0,Really cute but I bought a woman's large and had to stretch on a chair so it wasn't skin tight. My chest was crushed
4.0,all where great
4.0,warm an fits well
4.0,"I really want to like these sandals. They are simple and go with a lot of summer dresses, and right out of the box they were pretty comfortable for the 4 hours I ran around doing errands. My only issue is that they seem big/longer than sized. I am a size 9, and post-pregnancy I feel like I'm pushing into the 9.5 territory. These have a good inch ahead of my big toe! Because of that, the toe strap tends to cut across the tops of my toes weirdly an sometimes my pinky toe gets stuck over the strap. :/ But these are easy to slip on/off and haven't given me even a hint of a blister."
4.0,"WAY WAY too big for a pandora type bracelet.  We put it on a chain as a necklace.  My mother in law loved it, but I was disappointed it could not fit on her bracelet like we had planned."
4.0,Good quality but I had to send back the mediums for a small. They run very big !
4.0,If your going to buy this item buy a size smaller
4.0,"Came with a lot of the strings unraveled. It did look. Exactly like the picture, the size matched up. I just wish all of the strings weren‚Äôt hanging on the shorts. I got size 4"
4.0,"This shorts are ok quality, but they are too short and not as shown on the picture. The fabric is soft."
4.0,"The shipping took a good while, but the product was worth the wait!"
4.0,I like the feel of the boot on the foot. The size is a little larger than I am used to but a nice heavy pair of warm socks makes the fit right. I love the style except for the strap and buckle. They are a little cheap looking. Overall they are a good pair of boots for the price. The zipper does not go all the way to the top. That makes them a little harder to get on.  Would I buy them again.......yes.
4.0,nice i like the blue better
4.0,This backpack it adorable but the strap to hang it up came loose within a month of using it.
4.0,Nice and warm.  Soft
4.0,"Belt shown closed front,  but in reality separates in front when use anything other than last hole in the tab.  Changes look.  Does have decent stretch"
4.0,"This necklace was what I anticipated. The links were nice and uniformly round. The end that you attach the clasp to, is small and not easy to hang on to.  If you have dexterity problems you may not want this necklace or you may have to purchase some kind of ring to put on the end."
4.0,It's good for the price. Nothing extra special but it dose what it's suppose to do.
4.0,Smells a little funky but I hand washed it and it was fine. On the larger size but it has an inside flap so when you make it smaller it doesn‚Äôt ruin the design.<br />Super happy to rep my man Hisoka.
4.0,"Well executed, the only small issue is the material is thinner than others I own. Slips a little through the hardware when very active. Love it anyway!"
4.0,"It's great for the price. Fit is big so not very flattering, but wear it with a sweater or jacket and it looks fine"
4.0,Nice shirt and very comfortable.
4.0,Nice product but didn't receive freebee.  Chains outweigh some pendants and end up in front due to gravity.
4.0,"Pendant is nice, much larger than I expected.  The chain looks cheap."
4.0,"I am a 14-16 and the XL fits a little long in the sleeves, but fine every where else.  Because of my hips, had to get an XL, but it is a perfect fit and I can zip it up."
4.0,It looks just like the picture but the quality is not the best. The price you pay is the perfect amount for the quality
4.0,Very nice. It took a while to get them but they‚Äôre cute and fit my granddaughters perfectly
4.0,"Very small, but good quality for the price."
4.0,"Beautiful, eye-catching silver earrings. Only four stars because they frequently slip out of my ears. I've taken to using extra backings from other earrings to ensure they stay in place. But they are fine, attractive, light-weight, and leaf looks just like a real one."
4.0,"Really like these once I got a pair that fit. these, but had to order 2 sizes larger than I usually do."
4.0,Cute but size up
4.0,Hmmmm 13 yr old got this and tail and ears.....had to have a chat lol
4.0,I love my pearl earrings.  they are really great for the price and they come with a certification.  The packing was very cute and lets you keep the certification inside.  My only complaint would be that I didn't get peach pearls I got gray pearls.  Since I wasn't buying for a specific outfit I just kept the gray.
4.0,"This is a perfect product if you are looking for something super tight. If you are looking for something to smooth your shape, go with a much bigger size than you would normally. I am a S/M normally."
4.0,"I'm 5'2, was way too long for me. I am going to get it altered to be a high/low though. Fabric is lightweight and nice."
4.0,"Very large and stretchy. I bought for a Halloween costume so I can make it work but it runs very big. It is bunched in the back by the zipper. If I had purchased for a dance recital, I may have been disappointed with the quality and fit, but for a costume it‚Äôs fine. If you truly want form fitting, just know it‚Äôs on the big size. I‚Äôm tall 5‚Äô10‚Äù and was worried about the length but it‚Äôs super long. I wonder how someone shorter could wear it because it‚Äôs almost too long for me. I‚Äôm a size 8 but ordered an XL to be sure for length but probably could have ordered a medium and it would have been fine."
4.0,"This is a nice shirt with a great feel.  It is relatively comfortable considering it was too large.  The color stood up to multiple washings, but didn't shrink as I hoped it would.  The overall feel of the shirt is nice.  It looks good, holds its shape and remained comfortable after a day long trip.  Check you size when ordering and you'll have a good shirt to wear."
4.0,"I gave 4 stars because they broke pretty easily and the gold rubbed off fairly quickly. other than that, they look super cute!"
4.0,"i love this ear cuff<br />someone wrote review that she did nit receive silver, but i got a silver one.<br />its cute and easy to use."
4.0,These toe rings are really nice for brass. I love that they have kind of an ‚Äúold world‚Äù design and they are super comfortable. I usually have to take my toe rings off when I wear socks and shoes but I didn‚Äôt have to with these which is  a huge plus. I don‚Äôt know how long these will last because they are brass but they feel durable and thick. My oldest really wanted them so I went ahead and gave them to her. She will probably wear them a lot more than I would anyway. It is great that there is four to a set and I think they would be perfect for stocking stuffers this Christmas.
4.0,It's cheap but durable. Thanks for the quick shipping.
4.0,"Works great, but it's really tight and uncomfortable in the ears. I've tried stretching it over larger items over night without any luck."
4.0,"My wife wanted to get me a new wallet as my other one was falling apart. For me, wallets are not on the top of my 'fashion needs' list but she also wanted the safety of the RFID aspect ad well and THAT works great..we use a card with chip to gain entrance to the building I work in and if I put my card into the wallet and put that next to the reader by the door it will not open the said door. If I open the wallet  a bit and the card was able to open the door but it will work if you just keep your wallet in your pocket, etc"
4.0,Cap is good but a little<br />Big for a 6 months
4.0,"I should have ordered the next size up, as these pants fit me a bit small. Very comfy and look great for the price!"
4.0,"These reading glasses look good, work well and are comfortable to wear. It hits all the points that I need for reading glasses. I like that they came in a 2 pack as it is nice to have a back up. Glad that I tried these glasses. I like them."
4.0,Delighted with the substantial fabric. The color was described as burgundy. It's really more of a deep fuchsia.  Falls nicely on my curves.
4.0,"The lining of these shoes is very warm. However, my boyfriend had to put insoles in the shoes because the sole has very little padding at all."
4.0,My husband loved his shirt! Fits great!
4.0,These fly off the shelf at my boutique.  Not the highest quality workmanship so I have to replace the clasps and chain to sell them.
4.0,"It's bigger than I thought, I was hoping it would fit into my hand but it's about twice the size of my old one that did.  Lots of good compartments and credit card slots though."
4.0,"Amazing figure hugging dress, I tell you this is a very sexy dress that all curvy girls should have.<br />I loved the color combination and the stitching.  The buttons however were not very well attached.  One of them fell right away when I wore the dress.  Wish if the slit was in the back better than the front side.<br />Will buy a different color if available."
4.0,Awesome but it's starting to unravel. I guess they were cheap on the material.
4.0,A very soft comfy dress. Flattering shape. It is not as formal as pics look on ad but still very pretty. Feels like your favorite T shirt.
4.0,Material is a little rough but overall is a nice shirt.
4.0,I like it a lot! Very pretty set.
4.0,"Good item, fitted my head for school project"
4.0,Nice fit. Breath easy
4.0,Nice but size is large.  Keeping because good for driving .
4.0,"i love the stripes and colors - but the shirt just isnt working for me.  it runs a little short for my taste and the bust area is kind of weird.  it is the size they say however it still just runs tight.  and there's extra fabric inside by like inches and when the shirt is on, the line of that fabric show which i just don't love.  i can either trim the fabric up to avoid the look of it or just have the weird showing.  it's very loose in the mid-drift section so easy to hide belly flaws if it's right length on you.  it's super cute in person, just not as super cute on me."
4.0,"This is the second dress that I've ordered, the first one was returned due to a large stain on the skirt.  This one also had some smudging but I determined it could be washed out and I don't have time to wait for another exchange process.<br />It's a bargain.  It's very flattering.  Iam 6 feet tall, I wear a 14-16 US and am a 40D.  I ordered the XXL.  It's almost too large.  I could comfortably go down to the XL, but I like having a loosely fitting summer dress.  I'd recommend it."
4.0,"I ordered a 6-8 for my petite 7 year old and it JUST fits...she is 47&#34; tall and 48 pounds.<br />The leotard is good quality, though."
4.0,"Cute dress, love the style. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is due to the belt.... I wished it actually went all the way around instead of Just through the two holes it has in the front"
4.0,"For my back I use it all the time so it traer so this is why I want to by it again, I purchase a different brand but is no the same it move a lot from my waist and it doesn‚Äôt work for my back."
4.0,The fit is a little snug. I reorder a size up to see if more comfortable.
4.0,"I was raised in poverty. But as I grew older, I became more astute, and cunning, to the point where I bought my first house when I was only 17. Soon enough, I would own 5 cars, 4 boats, and 2 more houses by the time I was....17 3/4.<br />One day I saw the Patek Philippe....and I said to myself: &#34;Rich man....this watch belongs on your wrist.&#34;<br />So, I worked my best to acquire this exquisite item.<br />Sold most of my houses.<br />Took out multiple loans.<br />And one day, after having achieved everything in life.....the watch, was mine.<br />Now, I live under a bridge, and perform fellatio for 2 dollars.<br />But my wrist is as luxurious as can be."
4.0,Bought these frames for half the price I would have paid through a local vendor.  They are durable as well as comfortable.
4.0,"This is a cute dress and thicker material than I thought it might be, but not too thick...just perfect for a Texzs summer!"
4.0,"Excellent product,"
4.0,"I really like this tote. It has great details, tons of space, plenty of pockets, and I love the turquoise color, which is more of a green than a blue. I also love the tassel. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that there is no stiff lining in the bag to help it stand up, so you have to hold it up while adding or removing items, and it tends to collapse once you let go. Other than that, I'm enjoying the bag."
4.0,"Nicely presented in the box, necklace is real silver."
4.0,Pretty pieces.  I love the leather smell and the gold accents make for a dash of elegance.  The clasp on the necklace is  a little difficult to manage I feel but not a deal breaker.  Necklace fits slightly looser than a choker type necklace.<br />I'm happy with it.
4.0,My usual size medium fit well<br />Green is very pretty on many skin tones
4.0,These were perfect for my back to the 90s themed birthday party. My friends and I wore them just like old times. One of the flowered ones was broken upon arrival however.
4.0,"All were excellent but the &#34;Lapis&#34; will lose color if warn constantly from sweat or shower. Best to take it off if working outside, exercising or showering."
4.0,"Fits a little big, but that's okay. Gives a bit of room for growing.  My daughter loves it"
4.0,Definitely size down!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 145 lbs and I got a large to have a comfy baggy look and it‚Äôs very big. Definitely could have ordered a medium and still be comfy and baggy but fit me a lot better.
4.0,Expected it to be cheap looking. But surprise surprise it was actually quite nice. She really liked it. Great find. Denis T.
4.0,"The purple is vibrant and the hoodie was warm enough. A little silly, not sure how much use I'll actually get out of this, but overall a decent hoodie."
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute, really soft. However it stretches which makes it too big on me and they don‚Äôt have a extra small to buy so therefore I couldn‚Äôt get my proper size, I‚Äôm hoping if I wash it, it‚Äôll shrink."
4.0,Use this for my tragus. The middle one worked great.
4.0,"Well made & imprint is nicely done. However, for a perfectionist the fabric should be equally sewn on same side. This is only disappointment."
4.0,"They are well made and work, but on my black shoes the gray color is not acceptable.  They made an otherwise uncomfortable pair of shoes wearable, but only for yard work or other times when I don't mind looking like a duffus.  If they will bring back the black ones I will buy two or three sets for my work shoes but I don't wear white shoes so the gray and white loops don't do me any good."
4.0,"The material is breathable and nice, and I love the camo pattern, but I feel like it only stays on about half the time and I'm getting a neck cramp trying to hold it up. It's constantly sliding down."
4.0,"We bought this for my husband.  He wears glasses, and this fit just fine over those as well (It was one of the questions we had before purchasing).  If he had one complaint, it was that he wished the neck could be a bit longer, so it would go to the collar of his shirts, but then he is rather tall.  There is the smell of latex to deal with, particularly at first, but it wasn't too strong."
4.0,Get one to two sizes larger than you normally wear. To prevent shrinkage wash in cold water and hang to dry.
4.0,The dress is a little longer than expected (but I am only 5‚Äô1‚Äù). I had to return it because my skin and the material didn‚Äôt get along. Other than that I would have loved to keep it.
4.0,I liked the color and the design.  I would have liked the fit to be a little more tailored.
4.0,"It had a bulge on the zipper side, but still looks good"
4.0,"The price was good, but I didn't like the feel against my skin.  I could hear switching when my legs rubbed together."
4.0,"The shirt is cute, but buy a size bigger than you normally would! I always wear a small (I'm 5'9&quot;, 140 lbs), but the shoulders are a bit tight and the sleeves are wayyy too short. However, the shirt was packaged well and delivered a day early, and it fits everywhere else."
4.0,The only issue i have is the material is kinda see through. other than that i love the skirt
4.0,"I liked the product, somewhat larger than expected but nice. Arrived on time"
4.0,NICE SET. I LOOK FARWARD WEARING IT TO SEE IF THE COLOR WILL NOT CHANGE.
4.0,Bought this to wear under board shorts on a cruise/beach vacation.  They were comfortable and quick drying so I was able to wear them most of the day without issue.
4.0,"It was a great toy and great prop for costume but it did break very easily about halfway through the night especially with a four year old, tried fixing it and it broke again."
4.0,"Very cute and super comfy, but they're already looking a little sad and pilly after a couple of weeks. Given the fleecy fabric, it's inevitable that they wouldn't look like new for long, but I wish they would have stayed fluffy and plush a bit longer."
4.0,Super cute! The shirt is a little thin but still like it
4.0,My 7 year old is very happy with this watch and has fun with its features.  I wish the steps reset automatically everyday like other activity trackers.  The battery status indicator could also be easier to read.
4.0,"When I put these on all I could see was Sun Ra's Rolling Stone cover, photo by Baron Wolman. They are VERY gold. I erred in believing they were amber. In looking back at the description, the photos clearly show that the lens is dark green with a gold coating. The coating is much more opaque in real life -- and oh, so reflective.<br /><br />The shape of the frame is elegant and graceful. The frames are lightweight and comfortable. I found the nose-piece comfortable as well. I am unable to review the effectiveness of the lens until the sun appears in this portion of the world. When that happens, I will update my review."
4.0,This necklace is beautiful! Looks just like the picture. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the chain is not adjustable.
4.0,"We have our new 2022 Calendar of Yorkies! We've been buying them since 2000. Great quality, easy to write on for our appts. Stickers attach without a problem. And the Yorkies are ever so cute.....<br /><br />Need a calendar? buy one from Red Ember Press!<br />You cannot go wrong."
4.0,"I read through the description and realize these run on the small size. I usually wear size 34 and order large or medium. So for this I ordered extra-large, XL, and it was still quite snug, almost too tight, but it does just fit. I could have probably even gotten XXL and it may have fit. So I would recommend ordering one and a half to two sizes up from your usual American size.<br /><br />These are styled more like swimming trunks than they are like workout shorts, which is why I guess they are gym beach casual, but I would say more beach than gym. They are attractively styled and I like the colors and I do recommend them for beach and other water sports, just be careful about sizing.<br /><br />I did receive these free of charge, and this is a fair and honest review."
4.0,"This was the second Floerns dress I bought. Again, a very cute dress and loved the material. At 90 lbs and hips at 33&#34;, I bought an XS. I was very disappointed as it was extremely large for my frame. I had at the same time ordered the Floerns Women's Floral Bodycon Cocktail Party Summer Dresses Black Flower, also XS. That dress was super tight around the hips. So odd the huge difference in XS sizing with Floerns apparel. I returned it."
4.0,True to size perfect fit.  My first time buying CrossFit  Shoes I love these I would recommend them to anyone wish I had gotten the black ones but they were not available the blue and gray are awesome ankle support is terrific the soul feels like you have a wonderful foot plant when you put your feet down all around wonderful shoes
4.0,Not very warm in the arms. But I like the length and seems rugged for working so far.
4.0,The right size an length but not the shade of blue I expected. .but its ok
4.0,It was a little big at the top
4.0,"These bike shorts are just the right length , and the fit is great, size is correct I'am 5'7  and 155 lbs. they do not ride up, they stay where you put them. Not too much padding . I tide for about 15 to 20 miles on just a regular bike. , no gears."
4.0,"I was quite surprised by the quality of this skirt - it's very pretty - and I love that it's a high-waist skirt. Unfortunately, it's a little too big for me so I haven't been able to wear it out yet. If your waist size is on the smaller size (25in or smaller) I will warn you that you will have to get this taken in."
4.0,Wore with my birthday outfit it was cute broke quick!
4.0,Very cute colors.  Quality seems ok but not as thick as other bathing suits I‚Äôve purchased.  My daughter has worn it a couple times and it seems to be holding up.
4.0,"Really fashionable, received for my birthday."
4.0,My 2t child fits perfectly in a 4
4.0,Like the dress!
4.0,Gave as a gift person wears size 4-6. Bought medium 8-10 so it would be roomy. It just fit
4.0,The dress/ shirt is very cute but a bit more on the orange red side?
4.0,Nice material but does run small
4.0,Used once. Warmed up like suggested and it applied easy. Have it hanging and it is soaking in very well.
4.0,"Loved this, it was a nice airy sweater that is not too thick but keeps you warm. Feels nice and looks nice."
4.0,The styling is great and it is well crafted but could be a touch larger
4.0,Very pretty design with nice colors but the velvety material makes breathing a little labored for long wear use.
4.0,"I like this dress but it's not exactly as pictured. In the picture, the pockets look as though they are a couple inches below the seam where the top and skirt come together, the model looks like the pockets are just below her hips. The dress I recieved, the pockets are at the seam, above the hips. The pockets add bulk at the worst place to do so. If only they were 3-4 inches lower like the picture appears. Still a very comfy dress but diminished. FYI mine is an XL"
4.0,"I am 5'10"", and this dress is a bit short! I generally wear it with tights for extra safety, and it's not a dress I can wear when I'm wrangling kids, but it's a beautiful color and very flattering! Perfect for a night out or a nice event."
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but a nice piece
4.0,very comfortable though
4.0,Cracker cake off within 2 minutes of using it but nothing that tape can‚Äôt fix
4.0,Item was too small but the customer service was fabulous.
4.0,The size is right but the neckline is a little wears. It‚Äôs a higher than pictured. I ended up having to cut a v shaped slit in the front of it to make it feel a little less suffocating. But cute for for the price overall.
4.0,It was perfect for our maternity photo shoot and will use when the baby gets here too.
4.0,"These are inexpensive, but still pretty warm. I was wanting a trigger finger mitten for cold morning and cold camp outs. These are warm enough in moderately cold temps, but since it's a mitten you can squeeze some hand warmers in there if it gets really cold.<br />My guess would be they're not very durable, and I haven't had the chance to really test their water resistance either. So I'd say if you're planning on skiing/snowboarding with them they probably wouldn't hold up, but for camping or cold walks they're fine."
4.0,Looks great!  Son loves it!
4.0,"Cool pocket watch that my son loved but a little flimsy. It's decent quality considering the price, but the chain comes off easily."
4.0,Nice t-shirt
4.0,The best part of this cute hat is that it is packable. This makes it so easy to take on a trip or to the beach for the day. I live in the sunshine state so sun hats are a necessity here. Even though the hat has UPF protection it also has holes. The sun peeks in the holes so there is not as much protection as desired. The color and style are very attractive but add sunscreen for total protection.
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered an XL, I'm usually about an 8 in USA sizing. This is cozy and easy to wear and exactly what I expected. The shape of it works well for me but I could see it being weird for some people."
4.0,"Good polo shirt for the cold. Fits slightly tight but not ""athletic"" fit. Good materials and arm length."
4.0,"It was nice. Felt nice, nice movement. I'm 5 ft 4 and it was a little long, so it looked a bit homely"
4.0,"I am 5'6"" weigh 172lbs. Purchased the medium size and it provided the right amount of space to wear it while wearing riding jeans, t-shirt and riding jacket.<br />Experienced using this on 3 separate occasions while raining. 2 times with stopping on side of road to quickly put it on and didn't take long.<br />Kept me dry with only a little dampness on knees<br />Will try to update on how long it lasts when the time comes to replace but don't think I'll have to for some time"
4.0,This is fun piece that is great with casual clothes in the summer--or even with a bathing suit.  It is for anyone who wants to remember the beach.  Nice gift
4.0,"Material feels kind of cheap, but I like the organization. Hope it doesn't tear. Just wish there was a coin purse attached to it!"
4.0,"Excellent value for money. The hands and bezel are nicely upgraded from  standard. Mine arrived quickly and so far is keeping excellent time. There are machining marks on the case between the lugs and the standard bracelet clasp is crap. That said, this is a cracking watch for the money and utterly charming on the wrist. The crystal is gorgeously domed acrylic."
4.0,"Very nice quality mask. Arrived in good condition. I ordered 2 for my daughter and I. The stone had fallen off my daughters but that was an easy fix. Besides that small issue, great mask."
4.0,La calidad de la impresi√≥n del body de beb√© no fue muy buena. La de la camisa del pap√° estuvo bien.
4.0,Love the shape. My friend got a similar pair and I loved them so I ordered a pair.
4.0,"I love the item by itself - it is elegant, simple and very light. However, the pendant that came to me appeared to have been scratched (maybe at the factory) and wasn't polished to the &#34;new&#34; level I've seen on similar jewelry pieces. If it wasn't for this issue, the item would have gotten all 5 stars it deserves."
4.0,"These are really cute! They look exactly as pictured and are really warm. The only issue I had was mine had a few odd colors stitched in, like blue."
4.0,A simple bead bracelet. Nice.
4.0,"The one pair are a little tight on my fingers, otherwise they did the job perfectly!"
4.0,"I get so many compliments when I wear this dress. Make sure to order the right size, material is stretchy but when it stretches it makes the dress much more sheer."
4.0,"These worked better than I expected.  I thought they would tear before the day was over, but they did not.  I would order again if I was going on a trip."
4.0,They provide a nice box so as to give as a gift. The stones are very good quality with luster. It is a simple earring and know that they are not quite a half carat each. But good value for the money!
4.0,"Comfortable,  stylish."
4.0,Cute and very light weight.
4.0,"Pretty decent buy for what you get! In the future, if I need another pair, I would get ones that are a little more adjustable because I have a smaller head but can definitely make these work for now! Case is solid and provides the protection they need. They are light enough on the face to not be a nuisance but after a few hours can be noticable."
4.0,"This is a great summer dress. It is easy, breezy and very light. Under the light fabric, is an attached slip that fills in the areas you need to hide. This is a pretty dress that you can go to any dress function and look great. The spaghetti straps easily hold up the top. The ruffled top is cute. Unfortunately, the dress runs small."
4.0,Great garden gloves for the price.
4.0,p cool. no complaintz.
4.0,"I thought they would be a little more supportive, but good for the money."
4.0,"The band itself is super cute, nicely made. Getting it on my versa however, was a task. I had to trim around the metal piece on one side to get it to fully lock into place within the watch (last picture)."
4.0,Got this as a birthday gift for my daughter. She loves it says it very soft and comfortable
4.0,"The coat is a little bit large, but it is ok. My grandson love and he can use for a long time."
4.0,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this short and I wish I could wear it because I feel so sexy in it but sadly, like others have said, it gave me little paper cut like scratches on my arm."
4.0,"My hoops that I had for years finally broke so I got these. Can't beat the price and they are super cute. Would give 5 star, but had a little bit of an issue with the clasps on the middle sized hoops. I fixed it really easy, but it would have been great if there had been no problems in the first place."
4.0,"I love the rings! They are H&M which really surprised me. I have small fingers and the rings I got were a size medium. They didn't fit my knuckle (Would slide very easily) and they were tight around the bottom of my finger. Overall the rings are gorgeous and actually look real in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend them. Turned my fingers green too, but that didn't bother me :)"
4.0,I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like this dress. It‚Äôs a heavier material than you‚Äôd expect. The dress is quite flattering. I got the green stripe. It‚Äôs a keeper.
4.0,"I bought a size medium for my husband, but they are too tight on his head. They are really lightweight and I appreciate that they came with a soft carrying case to prevent scratching, but he needs a bigger size. I wish there was more information about sizing."
4.0,"A bit small, but it works for me.  A classic take on the white blouse. I especially like the tie-front effect. Casual yet tailored - great with black or navy pants."
4.0,"Comfy material, nice balance between stretchy and soft"
4.0,"I really liked this and it's super soft/comfortable to wear. However, when I walk it rises up just a bit and then you can see too much through the slit in the back."
4.0,I love this color of green.  I am able to wear these with several outfits I do recommend them to those who love to wear colors whether casual or dressy occasion. Perfect for those with foot problems even though not real leather
4.0,"Love my bikini! It is very cute, and I get a lot of compliments. It does fit close to the skin, but I think that's better so nothing goes flying off at the beach. Only complaint is that the top neck string is not adjustable."
4.0,"I bought this for tail bone protection during snowboarding. The size chart is accurate, the product is lightweight and comfortable but the protection pad is a little bit short. It feels like most part of the pad is above the tail bone. It does some protection but could be better."
4.0,The fabric is wonderful but the skirt rund a little small.
4.0,"Love the scrunchie.  It fits perfectly. I got the large, is so much cooler than a regular band."
4.0,"I ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and am very pleased with that decision.  These are surprisingly comfortable.  I am not a heel person but am able to wear these and walk very easily.  My only issue is that the straps are a bit loose/wide even on the smallest adjustable setting.  So far this has not caused any blistering/raw skin.  I have worn these with dresses, shorts, and skinny jeans so they are a very versitle shoe and the price was great.  These are not as comfortable as flip flops, but they are definitely my go to summer heel."
4.0,These fit my 10 year old but are too big for my 6 year old.  One of them had a broken strap when we received them but the rest have been fine so far.
4.0,Death the kid sweater... Now my daughter wants it may have to order a second one.
4.0,I like it. Very warm and love the angel print sleeve. But I had no idea associated with the silly b movie.
4.0,"Pretty, noticeable and lightweight"
4.0,"nice sweatshirt, but sized too small by about one whole women size."
4.0,"I've had the same one for over 20-years, but it's starting to deteriorate so I got another."
4.0,A little delayed in their arrival but well worth it! They are beautifully made and a unique couples jewelry item. My boyfriend absolutely loves them as well. I highly recommend these for any couple who wants something unique.
4.0,"Chin strap offers little assistance in a windy climate, but a great sun hat overall."
4.0,Other than it being too small it was a nice product. Sad they didn‚Äôt Have one size bigger.
4.0,Disappointed. I was looking for scarves with snaps. The picture showed a snap. The bottom 4 pictured all have snaps. The top 4 do not. I also searched specifically for masks with filter pockets and these came up. They don't have the pockets. Feel mislead.
4.0,"the fabric was different than i excepted, didnt quite flow, a little stiff. maybe with a wash it will be better but i wish i had ordered a size or two bigger for a less snug fit."
4.0,Just your run of the mill polyester tie.  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,"Quality of this necklace seems good, and the looks are definitely comparable to the Phiten Mirror necklace ($85 Necklace).<br /><br />Water Proof and causes many compliments.<br /><br />This necklace is actually 20 1/2&#34; rather than the 19&#34; as described which is definitely too large, but I like the way it looks and feels nonetheless.<br /><br />Necklace is beginning to pull away from the clasp on one side."
4.0,Great Gift Husband Loved it comes in nice box
4.0,Very good belt. The ratchet does a great job of getting the belt to the perfect tightness. The only gripe I have is that the end of the belt that attaches to the buckle will wiggle loose and become separated when tightening the belt. I believe that the teeth that hold the buckle to the belt cannot grip the belt as it has stretched. I will have to cut about 1/2 in every time this happens and at some point the belt will be too small.
4.0,It's a nice belt.
4.0,"I think the 6mm 1ct size is a little too big for females unless it is a fancy event. I'd go with a 4mm size, ladies, otherwise you will get asked if they are real :)"
4.0,It is just what we wanted. It will work great for what we needed it for.
4.0,I really liked the overall quality of this top but unfortunately it was too small for my chest (I‚Äôm a 32ddd)  and when I took out the padding it wasn‚Äôt appropriate to wear to the gym anymore.<br />The color is also very pretty and I loved the little handwritten note that came with it!
4.0,"This is acutally a nice product for the price.  The gem stone has a flat appearance (dull), however, it was a good choice."
4.0,"I‚Äôm going to start off this review saying that I love the fact that these socks have a no slip lining on them. What I‚Äôm not crazy about is the fit, they just go around my toes and I‚Äôm afraid that the socks will show signs of wear and tear in the near future."
4.0,Nice material.  I think I will like it better after I iron the seams flat.
4.0,Very pretty though some of the stones were glued on uncentered
4.0,"Easy to adjust, and once used to, easy to take on/off.<br /><br />Not water proof, and water will soak into the webbing, unlike original plastic band."
4.0,I am glad that I purchased this. It is striking in appearance and appears to be well made. When I wear it behind the pulpit it is just another little reminder for folks to get their answers from the TOP!
4.0,"This dress didnt fit me, ordered a small and it was too large. I am 5'5"" and 140 pounds, it was too lose and baggy on my own body."
4.0,Looks good with my black sport jacket
4.0,"It's really cute,  looks like Leo.  However,  its smaller than I thought,  and the chain is a bit shorter than I like.  I do like it, tho"
4.0,"Top was still super cute and quality is good for the price. However, this type of top doesn't look good on my body type (L/XL) so ended up returning."
4.0,Nice Collector's Item
4.0,"It was a little looser than expected, but I ordered a size up as I didn't want it to end up way too small after reading some of the other reviews. Also, the fringe on the bottom was sewn totally wrong, its in three uneven sections, one stopping almost mid way on the front of the garment. Kind of an eye sore to someone like me to sews and notices these things, BUT since no one else has seemed to notice, I didn't take a start off for that. In fact, I've gotten many compliments wearing it, so I'm happy about that.  It also was soaking wet and smelled awful when it arrived (like diesel?). I hand washed it a couple times and the smell has subsided, so hopefully it will be gone after a couple more washes. Its really a great deal for this shirt though, I guess I get what I pay for. If I can get the smell off of it, Id consider ordering the black one also."
4.0,"The velcro band is kind of off, not fond of this purchased item to trigger trump supporters. That‚Äôs the good part."
4.0,"I like to change the bands to what I am wearing and this band matches many items! Is not as easy to clean as I was hoping, but still a keeper."
4.0,When you get it you have to cut some of it off for your waist size and then you have to put the buckle on. A small amount of the material has already peeled off of the edges. I don't think anyone besides me will ever notice. It looks nice though. Just got it today and I must say I am having trouble figuring out how to get it off though. There's this little lever knub that you're supposed to pull on to release the belt and it won't budge.
4.0,You get what you pay for. From a distance they look fine but when you get up on them they look somewhat cheap. They have not fell apart so I'm happy. Wear them for work but will not wear them on a night out with the wife.
4.0,"Wish it had a button or fastener to hold it besides the cloth belt! I added safety pins to keep it together. Breat material, quality, and color."
4.0,Great bag for travelling
4.0,Product works pretty well. Sometimes you have to apply it a second time though.
4.0,Great workout tanks.. only gripe is that the scoop neck is a little too high but other than that it‚Äôs great!
4.0,Not to bad a nice solid heavy ring bigger than I thought it would be looks exactly like the picture my only problem was the base of the ring you can see the seam where they put it together but well worth the money very pleased a good buy for the hordey in you.
4.0,"Was skeptical about this purchase from the very beginning- mostly in regards to sizing. It ended up being a shein swimsuit. Material is odd, not typical bathing suit material. I‚Äôm usually a U.S medium bottoms and large top for swimsuits so I went with a large. Bottoms fit great but the top is far too small. Unfortunately I‚Äôll have to return it. The red color is so perfect though!"
4.0,Love the pants over all. It was too big for my small waist and hips.
4.0,Love the color but smudges easily.
4.0,"I love it's rustic beauty.  The hook to keep it closed does not work unless I have a rubber band on it, I think it is because I have small wrists, but for the price, what the hey. I'm a satisfied customer."
4.0,Button hole a little small over all nice
4.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and I put it in a cute shadowbox as a gift. He loved it! It let him live out his childhood dream of becoming a Pokemon master. My only issue is that the badges came in the box is the wrong order so I had to fix it when putting it in the shadowbox.
4.0,I loved everything about this jumpsuit except the fabric. Even though it was black you can see every lump and bump but it's a quick fix with smooth undergarments.. Wore this on Valentine's Day got so many compliments and I would definitely recommend
4.0,"This polo style sweater is the perfect weight to wear while transitioning from colder weather into warmer springtime temperatures. I'm a lover of long sleeves all year long and this lovely knit has found a welcomed home in my wardrobe. The fabric is very soft against my skin and the delicate cable knit pattern drapes well against my figure. I'm most comfortable in blue jeans which this sweater pairs well with. It's a nice change from the classic white button down shirt. I'm 5'6 and weigh 126lbs and usually wear a size medium. This sweater runs slightly large but because of the quality of the knit I find the extra room drapes well and lends itself to a very feminine vibe. However if you like a more form fitting sweater you may want to order a size smaller. I know that I'm going to enjoy wearing this sweater right through the warmer months, like on those cooler early summer evenings when you need a little extra warmth. This is machine washable which is always a bonus for me. I've posted a photo to give you a better idea of fit. I highly recommend this as a wardrobe staple that can be enjoyed throughout most of the year."
4.0,"This dress is stunning! Perfect Length, but a bit tight in the sleeves. Will be perfect for my engagement pictures!"
4.0,"Very nice dress but the waistline is too high, I looked like a pregnant woman"
4.0,"Es hermoso el dise√±o, pero no tiene suficiente elasticidad por lo que el ajuste al cuerpo no es perfecto. Recomiendo ordenar una talla mas que tu tama√±o acostumbrado."
4.0,Like other reviewers this bag came dirty. With a visible film all over the bag. I wiped it down with wipes and its still streaky but a nice buff with microfiber cloth should fix it. Its not used it came sealed double bagged so it came from manufacturer in this condition. That said its easily cleanable and looks like it will be sturdy for the use I want it for. I would be upset if I had bought as a gift as it did look gross and i'm definitely not overly picky.<br />So only buy if you want to put in some effort cleaning off a film of grime. It was only on the outside of my bag .<br />It does make a cute knitting project bag enabling you to see what you have stored in it. And you really can't beat the price.
4.0,It works for me..it's cute and sexy
4.0,Nice pants.  They're really comfortable but a little  bigger in size.
4.0,Does good job for the price.
4.0,"I very much like this hat...it fits a tiny bit snug, but I don't mind (even with adjusting it) and pushes my ears out a little. Overall, it is  good hat, comfortable and looks great."
4.0,"I purchased this before spending anymore money guessing. I like this, glad I purchased this."
4.0,"It did what I needed it to do, kept money and passport close by and out of sight.  I had to re-tighten the strap a few times, but the zippers and pockets worked well and the fabric looks new after a month of traveling.  Would recommend."
4.0,"It all turned out fine, but if you're expecting to get a black leather chain with it you might want to check with the seller before ordering because we didn't."
4.0,"Very comfortable, stays on all night, but there's still a tiny bit of light that comes in near my nose.  I wish it was a bit more adjustable around bridge of nose, otherwise a great eye mask."
4.0,"Nice product, only gave 4 stars because it leaves a big red mark on my son‚Äôs forehead. We‚Äôve loosened them but it doesn‚Äôt help. He‚Äôll wear them for this fall season, but I‚Äôll probably look into another brand for the winter sport season."
4.0,"these are comfortable and keep your feet warm.  they are not the best material, but i expect they would last a year or two."
4.0,"These are good because they are strong, but we're still waiting for solutions to a couple of problems with the latest generation packing bags in this category.<br /><br />PRO<br />-Sturdier than many competitors<br />-Zippers have holes for attaching labels<br />-Strong enough for toiletries, chargers, AC jacks<br />-Size choices are appropriate<br />-Carrying handles (not always provided on competitive bags)<br />-Good seller return policy<br /><br />CON<br />-Supply your own labels<br />-Despite the claim to the contrary, couldn't see contents very well"
4.0,i prefer it then the red and the Green<br />strong enough...<br />overall i like it...
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my upcoming baby shower event. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 , 118 pounds, ordered a small and wanted the dress to come to my knees, however it‚Äôs slightly above my knees which is fine because I‚Äôm adding tulle to it but the fit is amazing on my pregnant frame. I‚Äôll post pictures when I wear it! Will look into this seller again."
4.0,The little catch on the side kept the pendant from sliding through. Could not use.
4.0,Wish buckle was a little bigger
4.0,Gave it as a birthday gift to a friend and she loved it. Was her favorite of the gifts she received.  Also shipment was received in just a couple of days. üëçüëç
4.0,"I bought it to wear under my graduation gown, dress is a little too short for the event, but i will definitely wear it on a boat ride cruise during the summer."
4.0,"This is pretty decent - it's very soft, and it does not really look like its price point, especially when worn with a nice wool coat or jacket. It's warm and washes well so far."
4.0,"Good stuff, really lightweight and good quality"
4.0,Touch does not work.
4.0,"I like the sweater. It's a little thin, but soft and wears nicely. I should have gotten one size larger, but am overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Have to cut the belt to an ideal length. After that, it works and fits perfectly."
4.0,Great little belt to accessorize with dresses or outfits. Does enough for me to be a great accessory to my dresses for the spring/summer.
4.0,"SUCH A GREAT BUY FOR THE BUCK.<br />These chokers are super in at the moment and getting six of them for under ten dollars was a steal. The one thing I will say is that these chokers do seem to loosen slightly with wear. Other than that, a bomb deal.<br />Would recommend!!"
4.0,"I wanted these pajama pants because of the design and theme overall. The shapes and colors remind me of one of my favorite 90s sitcoms, Saved By The Bell...how fun! These pants are super comfy and are a good length. The material feels very stretchy and more of a Polyester and Spandex feel, these do not feel like 'sweatpants' as advertised, but definitely a fun pair of stretchy pajama bottoms and super comfy. Now for my only 'con' comment, these pajama pants do not fit very well though, a bit larger than expected! I ordered a medium size and they seem more like a large. I should have ordered a small and would have plenty of room still as that would have been more like a medium. Great pants though overall, I enjoy lounging around in them."
4.0,"Band is as pictured, wish there was just one more set of holes. I guess my wrist is on the smaller side.  Other than that it‚Äôs great."
4.0,Stretchy true to size and warm
4.0,"Fits well, seems nicely made."
4.0,"this is a thick t-shirt, perfect for winter. Good quality. I would buy it again."
4.0,Soft & comfortable material.  Just a little big for a size small.
4.0,Could see bra and underwear through the material.  Worked fine with slip and cami
4.0,These pants rock but the zipper blew out on my first pair.
4.0,Lots of laughs in this costume and the fan worked well.  Only complaint is the outfit rubs the forehead.  I suggest wearing a toboggan hat to prevent this.  Thanks
4.0,"A small scratch on the lens, but I can live with it.  Nice glasses.  Pretty stylish."
4.0,This shirt is really pretty but way too small.  I am considered a Small in U.S. sizes and I ordered up (I ordered a Large) and this shirt was too small and too short.  I plan on repurchasing this shirt in a larger size.  It's really pretty and would be great for work.
4.0,"It's a nice jacket, just runs super small. I usually wear a medium in hoodie and I ordered an XL. I'm really glad I did or else it would've been too small. It doesn't look exactly like the picture but it's pretty close and it looks like a VS jacket. For the price, you can't beat it but the shipping does take a longgg time. If you're willing to wait and order two sizes larger I say go for it"
4.0,"these socks fit, unlike the one-size-fits all tabi socks i purchased elsewhere.  i will probably buy more in the future."
4.0,Great boots. Very warm. Run small
4.0,"I really expected this item to be a little smaller, as my husband always complains when I carry a large purse.  Nevertheless it's okay."
4.0,"Beautiful, silk wings. The arm holes are pretty wide, and slip off my two year-old, but would be suitable for older kids. The material is pretty and allows for fluttery, flowing wings when running, flapping arms or outside in the wind. (: The material is silk, so snags and stains very easily."
4.0,I love this dress it‚Äôs super comfortable and great material!!
4.0,"...by the ad, not the movie or the game. No laser, piton gun, or the like. Just tells time and looks like the pause menu from Goldeneye.<br /><br />The band is super-cheap, though. Wish it were a little less...clinky."
4.0,Great pajamas for my Dad. They fit great and wash well.
4.0,Really nice on knock it stretches very comfy
4.0,Good o
4.0,Goes well with almost anything and fits well. It's a little small but otherwise ok.
4.0,Luv this. It is what i was looking for.arrived when it was suppose to.
4.0,The first picture makes it look like there are straps riding along the side to make it easier to tie in back. It is NOT that. Just a regular square bandana. That being said... Ooooh Yeah!!!
4.0,"I love the glasses.  The lenses are good quality.  However, the earpieces are very easily broken off from the glass and was sorry to have that happen.  I would buy more if they could fix the problem."
4.0,"The earrings are gorgeous, although they are bigger than they looked on the picture. I don‚Äôt usually wear my hoops that large, but I will wear these because they are very attractive."
4.0,Nice product but I have the wrong size it is too small very thin Figaro Bracelet.. unfortunately I would not be able to wear it so I would have to give it away
4.0,"Cute, matched my rose gold shoes and accessories, but it doesn‚Äôt have much room. If you need to hold a phone, card, and maybe some Bobby pins or a small lippie it will work fine."
4.0,It‚Äôs small for running errands stays o. As a crossbody
4.0,Love the leather look but it runs big
4.0,This is a very cute bathing suit.  I have received compliments while wearing it.
4.0,"Looks as pictured as far as the graphics on it, but more of a long sleeve shirt with a hood, than an actual hoodie/sweatshirt. Haven‚Äôt tried on so not sure of the fit yet. Will update."
4.0,Material was nice. It would have been great if it fit right. The sizing is off. I suggest getting it a size or two larger.
4.0,These slippers are adorable! My daughter likes to keep them on all day she loves them! However I don't think they are too comfortable because I saw red lines on her feet when she took them off. I guess they are okay if you need to wear them for a short time.<br />I should mention that my daughter is in between sizes 6-7. I wish they had a size between 6-7. These are 7-8 which is quite big on her. But I'll wait until next year!
4.0,Bought this to go with necklace with butterfly and once again not pleased.<br /><br />Revised:<br />Company offered to refund my purchase price. I was Ok with this outcome and the customer service they offered me.
4.0,Looks good for what I intended.
4.0,"do the job, pair with black pants and it looks good actually not so bad as I thought, knock off 1 star because my gf said it still hurts, but it could have been worse without it."
4.0,"Runs small, size up."
4.0,"There are a couple issues with these pants. For one, they run really big. I often wear a L or XL in pants, but a M fits me perfectly.<br /><br />Also, these are cheaply made. I don't mean the materials are particularly bad, but I don't have a whole lot of faith in the buttons, and the front pockets don't have sufficient material, so the lining shows when I'm just standing there. Basically, you have to wear a long shirt with these pants. Quite a bummer."
4.0,Good fit very comfortable.
4.0,"Good for the price, and worked well for a costume party."
4.0,The rings fit perfectly to the size. The colors are exactly as shown. It's a great buy for the price.
4.0,Has a weird lining almost like a swimsuit but it was easy enough to remove
4.0,"You get 10 pairs of different color bands (20 bands total); each with a key ring<br /><br />Extremely convenient to use when traveling short distances and don't want to dig into your pockets/purse/backpack/bag/ etc<br /><br />Very elastic, goes back to it's original default form within seconds.<br /><br />You can snap it if you make a conscious effort and use excessive force, or have it snag onto something and use all your strength to get away from something. For normal use, it works as intended.<br /><br />If you remove the key ring; can be used as a hair tie. Just note that it may be thicker and less visually appealing than regular hair ties<br /><br />There may be some excess loose plastic from manufacturing. Easy to scratch off"
4.0,Pretty nice. Colors are pretty. I bought these to wear with tanks or dresses so I could just show the straps. Somewhat less supportive with the small straps. I may add a strapless bra under them when I want more support. I might also sew the sliders in place on the straps so they don't slip.
4.0,"great shirt love the image and quality of shirt however is does run small as I ordered a medium and it fits but if shrinks may be snug (I usually wear a small so I already compensated by going up one size, which was a good thing)."
4.0,Great pants! Loved the color! Only problem was the pockets! It is kind of bulky but if you put your hands in them they are amazing!!
4.0,Strech is not comfortable for put on
4.0,"I got the blue bag. It‚Äôs a nice blue, just like it shows. It is larger than I anticipated but not too big. The material is soft and smooth but feels sturdy like it will hold up and is more flexible than I thought it would be without being too floppy, which is nice. It has a large interior zippered pocket on one side. Overall I really like the bag.<br />Cons: the strap is not quite long enough for the bag to hang low on my hip (personal preference), and the interior material is an awful brown color. It would be nice to have it match the exterior or to have a fun bright color instead (again, just my personal preference)"
4.0,Fit snuggly and great material
4.0,The top is very soft and comfortable!
4.0,It's excellently what I expected.  Perfect for my Wizard of Oz room.
4.0,"Like other reviews, I thought they were slightly lose around knees and lower leg but nothing really noticeable or that makes me regret buying them.  I bought them for the Star Wars Rebel Challenge, comfortable to run in, helped keep my legs warm for the early morning run.  Overall am very happy with them."
4.0,Beautiful color and solid frame
4.0,"Eyepatch is good. Nice and tight fit. But be careful and a warning ta any big headed people. If ya have a big head, Its really easy to break. The Hats are nice. Fits great an is awesome"
4.0,Super cute dress however very see-through  Not a dealbreaker for me you‚Äôre just gonna have to wear something underneath it
4.0,The top out of proportion larger than the bottoms.  I am 140 pounds and usually prefer  a large in pajamas so they are roomy but the top is HUGE.  Otherwise seems to be nice quality for the price.
4.0,"Before trying these on, I was going to immediately return because the fabric has a sheen that I just don‚Äôt care for. BUT, I tried them on anyway, and to my surprise I LOVE the fit! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3.5‚Äù, 140lbs (right now üòí) and i sized down to an xs. I‚Äôm almost always a small, edging towards a medium with my holiday lbs., but the xs is perfect! I do wish the rise was a bit higher. I would consider these a mid-rise, but they‚Äôre so comfortable, no muffin top, and the perfect length!"
4.0,Love the shoe. Feels comfortable except for a little snug. Will try the next size
4.0,The product looks great!
4.0,"very nice handbags I received my a few months ago, but the handle is not strong enough"
4.0,"The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is because it fit me me too large on the breast. I wear a 34DD and couldn‚Äôt fill all the space... üòì<br />Quality, I LOVED IT! It was beautiful and the satin part of the dress in the middle is SO flattering! It pulls the mid section together. I LOVED that! Very well made. It‚Äôs hard to get the zipper up by myself but with help it goes up. It just gets stuck where all the sewing is don‚Äôt on the ridge of the satin part... but once you get over that little bump- it slides right up the rest of the way."
4.0,i love these shoes they're great! the only downfall is when i walk my foot presses the button and keeps changing the color as i walk or it turns them on if i have them off and it drives me nuts!! i wish they werent a constant light tho i wish they would only light up when i walk on(u kno like little kids do)but i knew that these didnt do that b4 i bought them but ya
4.0,It was pretty good. A b it flimsy but did the job well.
4.0,The pieces are not sewn together as others have stated- I always put leggings under my girls tutu's anyways so that doesn't bother me. For the price this is a cute little tutu. My daughter is pairing it with the rainbow dash hoodie they match perfectly.
4.0,I like that it looks very pretty. I like the lift that I get. It fits pretty well. Im satisfied. What I dont like & its like this w/most bras the back where it hooks it scratches my mid back.
4.0,Bought for my husband.  He likes the extra support.
4.0,"After consulting a number of people, I picked this ring out of many other skull motif items, to replace a similar item. I'm really satisfied with the purchase. It looks great, stands up to a beating, and is subtle enough to pass for classy and bold enough to look great.<br /><br />My only minor qualm is to say that the sizing can be a little tight. If your fingers have the tendency to swell up a bit at times, you may run into issues like I have, but the ring is hardly to blame much."
4.0,The appearance is natural but the magnets hurt my ears when left on over an hour. They cut off my circulation.
4.0,Works great against the wind.
4.0,Great product - will buy agin
4.0,Light weight and soft. Medium fits like a large.
4.0,Product is good. I could only find one minor issue that the stones were not placed correctly in a few slots in the necklace but overall it doesn't look bad. I am quite happy with this and especially the packaging was very nice.
4.0,"I‚Äôve usually fit in a large size but  sometimes I am a medium. This dress is super cute and comfortable but there is quite a bit of room i definitely could have got a medium so if ur in between sizes like me go with the medium! I love the material and the pattern, I‚Äôve gotten several compliments!"
4.0,Some are a little off but most were great.
4.0,"Very nice for the price, though a bit fragile.  Speedy delivery!"
4.0,It runs big. Returning for a smaller size
4.0,"It's really comfortable but it is lightweight. Still, it's perfect for fall."
4.0,LOTS of compliments and they actually stay up.  One did already pop off a button though
4.0,"Great shirt- don't let the price fool you.  medium weight.  If you have arms &#62;16&#34; around your bicep, consider one size larger."
4.0,Giving four stars product works well only reason why giving four stars due to product ran late.
4.0,"I was excited to receive my Soundbot SB210 because I enjoy music while working it's starting to get cold and I work outdoors.<br /><br />It plays music for about 5 hours straight before needing to be recharged, the sound quality is good, and it's not bulky at all.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if the Velcro inside were placed better or even add a little more to allow the speakers to be positioned right where I need them.<br /><br />Over all I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,we bought these to help jog our memories on how to eat correctly. Reminds us just how you are to eat.
4.0,It is a beautiful dress. I ordered a large and it was a little big.
4.0,"This muscle tee fits well ‚Äî order a size up from normal size. It shows off your muscles - even if yours are nowhere near as big as the models. The material feels nice (a nice blend of poly/spandex) and is comfortable to wear during and after your workout. Unlike so many shirts out there now It seems well constructed and is holding up well. It goes from washer to dryer with no notable shrinkage. I will probably buy another in a different color. Most of my shirts like this are size L or XL (I wear my tees a little tight), but I ended up happy with a XXL.  I'm athletic, 6' 215, tiny bit of abs :)"
4.0,"This bra actually fits really well. It provides max support when running and eliminates bouncing. I just had my augmentation done, so support and affordability are big on my list. This sports bra despite how ugly it is, delievers."
4.0,"A bit lightweight, but expected for the price. Very unique-looking! I ordered Size 38, which for my 34-inch waist perfectly. Legs are long, have to roll them up to prevent them dragging on the ground when I walk. Love them!"
4.0,My son could not wear these. I had to return as they were too small.
4.0,"Service was super fast, The dress was pretty, ran a little large"
4.0,"ONLY downfall, the Velcro is a little low on closure, so if purse gets a little full, it's a bit hard to close and Velcro catches on clothing"
4.0,"Dislike - arrived with a knot in the chain. I was able to get it out, but not expecting that.<br />Liked- Perfectly petite and feminine for my granddaughter."
4.0,lovely dress the top is a little big!
4.0,"Very comfy, simple, flattering lines. Loved the pockets! I think this dress would compliment any shape or size. You can dress it up or down.5"
4.0,small for my 8 year old
4.0,"I LOVE these boots. However, for a 6.5 they're a bit big! I'd order half a size down next time, for sure. But super cute and hopefully, durable. They do seem pretty durable but I always feel like I have heavy feet and am hard on my shoes."
4.0,Thanks very Good boots
4.0,Really cute kinda short
4.0,Texture of leather could be better quality.
4.0,Fun and flattering. A cute dress that a girl is happy wearing
4.0,"I bought one for myself and one for my sister. It is super cute, but difficult to put on myself."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but reading the reviews I ordered a size up.  That was a mistake.  Was way too big.  I have to return now."
4.0,Love colors offered
4.0,Loved the color and fits a little big. I will buy it again in a different color
4.0,"Very small. The charm is beautiful, and very detailed. However, it is hard to see the detail due to size. I'm hoping when it oxidizes a bit the detail will come out more. The back is plain. For the price l think it could've use a simple little design. That's why I took one star away. On a charm bracelet it flips and it would doll it up and to give it the card look. I  searched pendant and this came up . Definitely a more of a charm as stated but I'm still gonna wear as a pedant just get a very dainty chain."
4.0,"Nice dress for the price, but elastic makes it somewhat small. Ordering the proper size what difficult due to the elastic sizing."
4.0,"so far so good, the strap looks great, love the design, only issue is that the strap lays at the top of the carabiner, and the top of the latch lays downwards being a little inconvenient for belt loops"
4.0,I love the feel and look of this sandal. So comfy but not to regular shoe sizes. I'm a 7 and the 7 was too small. My heel hung over the edge and the shoe sole is narrow. I'm returning to order the next size. Was going to get a 7.5 but they only have whole seizes. So it looks like I'll be getting an 8. Hopefully it's not too big cuz I really live this shoe
4.0,I bought these for atv riding. Keep from breathing dust on the dry Oklahoma trails. They work for Covid hysteria as well. Can breathe better than those hospital masks and my glasses don‚Äôt fog up as much. When you need a mask to enter some place.
4.0,This shirt is really flattering! Love it!
4.0,I'm tall so it works well as a long shirt with leggings.
4.0,I enjoy these just for staying at home.  They are exactly what I needed. A little to loose but wouldn't consider getting a smaller size.
4.0,Would like an outside compartment initially believe the two lumps on the outside were compartments
4.0,Product made well with good material. Packaged very nicely. Arrived fast !
4.0,Even though its not real wood. Its like a hard plastic material. At least you can get this wet. The only thing I dont like is the draw string when it gets sweaty or wet. It is very hard to take off or to put on.. Good Luck!!
4.0,Great shoe for my active boy. Nice and bright but still neutral with the black. This was a five start but after use I went down to four.... :( they fell apart so fast. I know It‚Äôs a boys shoe but i expexted Them to last a little bit longer. They were still cute but I won‚Äôt be able to use them for my next boy in that size.
4.0,A little tight - comfortable for a couple of hours - not a 12 hour day
4.0,I love Stance socks but these ones are just ok. A bit thinner material than Stance usually has and silk screened graphics. Not great quality.
4.0,wife loves them....thanks
4.0,I must have sent this bk because i do not have it. I did order a leopard one that i didnt care for because it didnt fit right.
4.0,These glasses helped me immensely with driving to and from work in total darkness. I needed to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights on dark and winding backroads and they gave me the confidence I needed.
4.0,"I ordered two of these coats for my daughter‚Äôs which I really liked a lot. I ordered a large and and extra large, which I ended up getting a large and a 2x. If I had gotten the extra large like I had ordered it would have fit perfect but it fits a little big. My daughter is fine with it so I won‚Äôt be returning. I would have gave 5 stars if I got what I ordered. A little disappointed."
4.0,"I purchased the navy top in sz L after going over the size chart. I'm typically a large-xl in shirts and have a longer torso. The fit is a little wonky, in that the bodice definitely has very ample space, as I can hold it out about a hand length from my body. The length is very good, and accurate to the size chart, and I really like the ruffle sleeves. The navy pattern is beautiful and accurate to the display picture.<br />Make sure you double check the size chart prior to purchasing, as you may need to adjust the size purchased. Otherwise I'd recommend!"
4.0,I really liked the weight of this jacket. I can‚Äôt drive with a thick jacket on and this was just perfect. You will really enjoy this purchase from Amazon.
4.0,"Lovely a little big in the boob and armpit area hoping that it will  shrink after washing may need just a large instead of an extra large, also the length was very flattering not to short."
4.0,Very nice looks just like photo!
4.0,Quality shirt but a little thinner than the last one I bought
4.0,"this hat is light weight, airy and covers my face, ears and my nape.  i love it cause it has the capabilities for me to use the pony tail feature to keep my hair up and off of my neck during these hot days here in arizona"
4.0,"Definitely HAND WASH.  This shirt fit my husband perfectly and he loves it.  He is 6ft, 180 lbs.  The patch/stitching needs Ironing work after a hand wash as expected.  Lots of dye releases from this shirt when washing so heads up."
4.0,"Super cute! You can tell they are cheaply made, but well worth it for the money!"
4.0,Good quality of fabric. Cut and fit nice. 5-8&#34; with 140 pounds and size M fit perfect. One star reduced bcoz collar has excess fabric. it's pattern issue.
4.0,Material does not stretch at all
4.0,It was not big enough
4.0,easy to carry.
4.0,I like the way it looks and fits.
4.0,Bought it for my daughter and she loved it. I bought a medium
4.0,"This band is good quality and is exactly how it was described and pictured. However, I have realized that I don't really like it very much because it is much more sporty than my others. I prefer the more dainty,<br /> smaller bands. There is nothing wrong with the band; it just ended up being one I did not prefer."
4.0,"I recieved  the Aenlley skater skirt for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />This skirt is very comfortable and cute. It's well made too. The fabric is soft and lightweight. The waist is very stretchy so it can accommodate a range of sizes easily. I wear a 18/20 pants and ordered a 2XL. It fits great and I probably could have sized down to a XL.<br /><br />I wish this skirt was a few inches longer. It would be much more flattering for plus size women. This is not a skirt you can wear to work or church as it sits above your knees. It is more appropriate for a summer day trip to the zoo, town, ect. Just adding a few inches to the length would greatly increase this products versatility."
4.0,"I used these gloves for making cold processed soap to protect myself from lye and they did a pretty good job. Plus, they're cut lol"
4.0,A little hard to put on and figure out which is left ad which is right but worth it.
4.0,LOVED how high waisted these are. In my opinion they are not completely squat proof (why I only put 4 stars). I normally wear a medium in leggings but got a small after reviews. I would buy these again. Bought blue marl<br />Measurement:<br />Hips: 40<br />Waist: 27<br />Weight: 137 lbs<br /><br />**UPDATE: I bought another pair (wine red marl) in small as well but this must be the original version. The material for these leggings are thicker and more compression BUT these ones are squat proof. I will need to keep original size for these ones.<br />If you‚Äôre confused if you‚Äôre getting the original version or the second version (like I was) I believe the original version only has one picture of model wearing the leggings where as the second version has multiple pictures and says version 2.
4.0,"I usually wear a size 10, I ordered a size M and the fit was a little snug.  I wanted it to fit loosely as shown in the picture.  I'm keeping it for winter use because it does keep you warm but wearing something bulky under it isn't possible."
4.0,"Nice product but no overlap in size. I ended up buying one sinze and on the last notch it was still too lose, so I purchased the smaller one and find that is just a touch too small on the first hole. If not for that fact, I would have gone 5 star."
4.0,"Follow the size chart.  I'm used to bathing suit sizes that are a bit different.  Ordered a 4 - 6 and had to return as it was too large.  If I just followed the size chart, I would have been fine.<br /><br />Suit is cute.  Worth the money.  We'll have to see how it stands up to the elements.  I would recommend it to friends."
4.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a cosplay outfit I would say to look elsewhere but if you are looking for a one time wear Halloween costume, it‚Äôs perfect, it fits exactly as it says (though if you are taller I might suggest a different seller this fit me perfectly I am 5‚Äô3)<br /><br />The fabric is not as cheap as I thought it was going to be and it‚Äôs fairy comfy. (I have a large chest and it fit my chest surprisingly well)<br /><br />It said it may take a month to get here but mine arrived in about a week or week and a half so overall I would recommend!"
4.0,"Bigger than it looks. Classy, sturdy!"
4.0,I love the hat.... but it is a lil too big... :(
4.0,"For the money, you can't go wrong with these.  I would buy these again if needed.  Much better quality than most low cost clip-ons.  A very handy case come with these."
4.0,they were gifts.
4.0,Works ok as it is a bit big but does the job so kept them.
4.0,They are pretty comfortable and seem to be have been made decent.
4.0,Tienen un lindo dise√±o pero son algo pesadas
4.0,These came in handy after foot surgery to cover my exposed toes when my foot was bandaged and unable to wear a full sock. Also great while wearing clogs! These lost one star because they snag easy so can't speak for longevity but they suited my current needs.
4.0,"Wear it under my gym shorts and tank when working out.  Love the way it clings to me and feels against my skin.  Gives me a little incentive on those days I don't want to go workout.  Just two minor issues, but neither would keep me from buying another product from this seller.  As one other commenter stated a could use a little extra room for your junk.  The other issue is with the shoulder straps.  On occasion they tend to slip down my arm and I am having to reposition them up around my soulder.  All and all am please with."
4.0,Was very good and breathable when wearing.
4.0,This is a fun solid quality shirt. It's not cheap feeling material but it does hit a little short in my waste length but I have a longer than average torso.
4.0,"Feels cheap, and some pixels are missing. But for the price, I think this watch looks great !!"
4.0,I LOVE THIS NECKLACE!!!  I'm not fond of the clasp.  It doesn't hold well.  The necklace is trulu a statement piece.  It's awesome and I get so many compliments!
4.0,"I was not sure about this when I first ordered it. Seemed expensive. But when I got it I was wonderfully surprised.  It is very sturdy and holds a lot of stuff. We are going to Disney this week with it and I hope that my son will wear it no problem. If not, I will wear it in the park. Lots of room for wet shoes or other items."
4.0,"don't buy your size or it will be too small, go a size up."
4.0,i love the shirt. i wish i would've ordered 1 size larger but hey i guess thats the risk of online shopping lol... cant try it on before you buy it. other than that its very durable and provide great arm protection during my paint ball games and the material for the torso breathes really well.
4.0,They are comfortable and work great at protecting my feet from rocks and creepy crawly animals!
4.0,The product is cute for play but the material is so thin that I would not use it for swimming. Still cute though.<br />I recieved this product at a discount for my honest review.
4.0,"Nice bag, just not big enough!"
4.0,For the the price you can't go wrong.
4.0,"These were for my son and although he loves the glasses themselves, we were not aware that they had the nose piece on them and that is taking some getting used to.  Overall he is very satisfied with the sunglasses."
4.0,Nice but tight.
4.0,"I bought a white version of this dress from a vintage-style website for my garden wedding last year for about 6x the price and loved it, but I wanted it in another color (and didn‚Äôt want to spend that money again). I took a chance on this version of the dress through Amazon and I‚Äôm SO glad I did! It fits perfectly and the colors are vibrant! The two reasons I wouldn't give this 5 stars are because 1- there is a very potent smell coming off of the material, though I‚Äôm sure it will wash out, and 2- The petticoat is SO scratchy! But with a slip on to protect my skin, it feels just fine. I would certainly buy this again in another color! (Check the side-by-side comparison of the white, expensive dress I bought versus the green, inexpensive version)."
4.0,Comfortable top that goes with so many colors.  I like it.
4.0,"I ordered this in great anticipation.  The color is ok but lacks the greenish tone of the photo.  The size should have fit.  I'm 5'5"" tall and in proportion and matched the size chart.  It was an odd fit.  The neck is so low you must wear a cami if you're to go out in public.  The photo does not show cleavage or the edges of a bra but I certainly did.  The dress is described as long sleeve but the photo shows below elbow close to 3/4 sleeves.  The actual dress has SHORT sleeves that are tight for the size of the chest and hit in the middle of the upper arm.  The fabric was slippery.  The length may be as listed, I did not measure, but my goodness it is way too short to wear without leggings, and I wanted this for summer with sandals.  If this was shown on a very petite model, small all around and also short, they should have told us.  I think this dress has great potential if the fit can be remedied.  I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a nice dress and if you are petite all over and don't mind short sleeves, I think it would be lovely on you."
4.0,"Really cute! They are not heavy for babies to use however they do run small, I ordered a size 5 for my 18m and they fit more like a size 4 I will have to give them away"
4.0,"Nice top, but not a fit for me."
4.0,The material is pretty thin. I am going to have to wear something under it because of how sheer it is. The color is great and the fit is great though.
4.0,Little big in the riv area love.material
4.0,Product is good but was shipped to the wrong place first
4.0,"The strap is okay.  So far it has held up.  The piece that hold the band down has the tendency to move, but so far so good.  I also do not really get it wet."
4.0,Nice set for a very inexpensive price. I got them for a gift for somebody and they like them.
4.0,I bought this for m niece and she liked it.
4.0,"somewhat small fit, however a nice pair of shorts. they are really beachy/summery/pool-y, especially with a solid color shirt and some espadrilles."
4.0,"Bought this for an evening graduation. I had so many compliments. The dress was just a little long for me even in heels, so I carried the back around a bit when outside. Paired it with a bolero jacket and opal necklace and earrings. It was beautiful. A little hard to iron due to the length."
4.0,great in style watch. would recommend to friends
4.0,Very cute. The fabric is a bit more &#34;shiny&#34; than I would like make it look a little cheap but worth it for the price.
4.0,This one came as true size.
4.0,"Very comfortable, thick durable material.  I've worn them about 5 times....they are great.  The top is a little wide, but they doubled the material for stability."
4.0,"Cute, but her toes come out..."
4.0,"This is a really cute dress. I love the style however, it is short! I wanted to wear it to work but I do not think it will look appropriate even with tights! I will still wear it out though casually (with tights still) I don‚Äôt want to order a larger size because I think the straps would fall down and not hold up because they are already a bit baggy. Very cute dress, just short!"
4.0,Esta muy lindo el color y la tela como se ve en la imagen.
4.0,The shorts fit well. I also like the pockets.
4.0,"I wanted a long narrow scarf. It is wider than expected but still works. It's very soft and comfortable.  Gave 4 stars because it could be a little longer to hang better when doubled. Overall,  I really like it."
4.0,"As pictured. Doesn't turn your finger green. It's very small, which is exactly what I wanted. Good for stacking. Looks a tad cheap, but not bad."
4.0,"So the quality isn‚Äôt bad at all,I thought it was going to be cheap material with some of the reviews...(yes I still bought it lol) my daughter loves it! The skinny strap broke right when I tried putting it on her, that‚Äôs why it gets 4 stars, but it still stays up and fits her."
4.0,These are well made and comfortable and they keep my legs warm! My daughter tried to take them from me and I said no way.
4.0,Fit and finish better than expected !
4.0,"These yoga pants are REALLY comfortable.  The seem sized well and are holding up well, too.  They stay in place on me, without slipping.  They seem well sewn, of good but not extraordinary quality.  There hasn't been any ""pilling.""  The pattern is cute.  These seem to be a good, average yoga pant with a good, average cost point."
4.0,"Not scratchy. Comfortable, but I would say its not overly soft if thats what youre looking for.<br />I bought this and tried a bleach tye dye. did not work the best. had to do it twice to get even a little result.<br /><br />I am adding patches and painting designs on the hoodie. This provided me with a perfect canvas."
4.0,"Nice shirt, decent quality tee, but the small is very small, and medium is closer to a large...."
4.0,"fit's as expected if you order 2 sizes up (it's asian sizing). Sleeves are a little short, work better pushed up. Super cute though."
4.0,Very cute dress fits my 4 yr old daughter came with the tags :)...I feel it's a bit pricy..... but my little one loves them nice soft material...shipping on time thanks
4.0,I'm a big New England Patriots fan..Was rooting for Joe Burrow /Bengals..<br />Liked the Bengals tiger.<br />I wear knit hats all winter..baseball hats in summer..I'm old guy..cold head in winter!!
4.0,"I bought the Berny AM7068 as part of a lightning deal for about $10 off.  The watch appears to function well, winding well enough to keep it running overnight and keeping reasonable time (within a minute after three days) for a mechanical movement.  The case finish is consistent and nice, but not particularly fine.  It is sort of a brushed looking finish, but I think is just visible grinding marks.  Either way it is well done for a watch at this price point.  The dial is clean and easy to read and the red second hand is a nice touch.  Note that only the second hand is lumed so you don't want to use this watch for a lot of &#34;night ops.&#34;  The date window is small and somewhat difficult to read in some lighting conditions, but it is functional.  The strap says &#34;genuine leather&#34; but is fairly thin.  It is certainly not premium feeling but not as cheap as some.  It does have a signed clasp that with BERNY engraved on it. This and the engraved rotor on the movement are really the only decorations.  Overall I consider this a solid, if unspectacular, automatic watch."
4.0,Bigger than expected but very nice
4.0,"Looks good, but better with a belt."
4.0,"Image shows its longer. I'm a fit 145lbs, 36D 5'3&#34; and it is shorter than expected. Falls right it the hips. Top portion fits perfectly I ordered true to size Medium"
4.0,The shirt is nice. But it runs pretty small. I would suggest going a size up from what you would normally wear.
4.0,First size didn't fit. Ordered two size down as material can stretch. Size L fits perfectly
4.0,"Very sturdy, perhaps a little too sturdy honestly!"
4.0,Small but nice.
4.0,"Amazing dress!!! Lots of compliments on it. I gave it a 4 because of the bones at the tail of the laces kinda sticks out. Overall its a comfortable and easy dress to wear. Very elegant, the detailing is well done."
4.0,"Came with an extra belt chain, packaged in a nice metal box. It's nice, but your getting what you paid for. Great for a kid, or a cheaper gift! Not so great if looking for a long lasting men's gift."
4.0,"Great socks for the fall. I didn‚Äôt get what I ordered though (3 pairs of all white). They sent me the gray, black, and white instead. Other than that they are cute socks."
4.0,"I wish there was an additional mechanism to keep the magnet attached more securely ( twist lock if you will) one light tug and it breaks connection. I fear it will separate unknowingly and it may just slip off. It has not yet, I love it ( good quality Bread)"
4.0,It's a great dress but simply doesn't fit me well.  Maybe after a few more pounds lost.
4.0,"Took awhile to get it , but when I did it is very cute and good quality."
4.0,I really this shoe for appearance purposes. I mean Navy blue is so hard to find. The fit was somewhat right across the toe andthe same  even when I went up a size. They do stretch out eventually.
4.0,"I like these earrings. They turned out to be smaller and more lightweight than I was anticipating, thus the four star rating. But they are comfortable to wear.  Just rather small"
4.0,"Nice shoe, cute and just perfect for the pool."
4.0,"good price, but seems a bit shoddy quality. but it keeps the dust out of my mouth and has a unique design"
4.0,Slightly big on my 3 year old but does the job it is intended to do during these long northern winters!
4.0,"The band was very nice, high quality, unfortunately I read my caliper incorrectly and ordered an incorrect size.  Other than that Speidel bands have been on many watches of mine for 50 years."
4.0,"A little bigger for a slim runner, but other than that its great!"
4.0,"I love the shirt but it is a size too small. Howeve, I am planning on trying to get to my pre baby weight so.... (fingers crossed ;-) ) The fabric is stretchy though."
4.0,"I got a medium which is what I wear and they were pretty tight. I still wear them and they are very soft, just wish I had gotten a bigger size."
4.0,Beautiful colors and durable. Used to make cloth masks. Saved some for other uses.
4.0,Nice! ! Actual size was a bit smaller than expected
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very nice dress. However, it didnt look as good on me so had to return it"
4.0,"quality is good, but it is smaller than the size."
4.0,"Very nice quality, frankly better than I expected for the price.  Would recommend."
4.0,Good quality product and very pretty!
4.0,HD to return. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and the bottoms were 4 inches too long. I like my comfy lounge pants to just touch the floor.
4.0,"Very pretty n different then anything else, pretty comfortable too actually forgot I was wearing it most of the night but I think I'm gonna see if I can put a clear tiny rubber earring back on the ends cause I did tend to catch it on my clothing couple times in 1 day. If that works it will be perfect"
4.0,"Cute bathing suit! Top fit a little small, but its manageable!"
4.0,Could be a bit firmer to stay put when rubbed by accident... but they do the job.
4.0,this jacket is a tad small on the wife but she has rather large breasts. So maybe thats it.<br /><br />fells nice and looks good. Seems to be well made with no issues so far. She loves the color which is awesome.<br />Medium warmth for fall months.
4.0,Very pretty purse!
4.0,"Came much sooner than expected. Good quality for the price. a little confusing to put on at first but looks amazing and is quite comfortable. Would recommend, would purchase again"
4.0,Was smaller than anticipated but you can really put a lot of stuff in it - good quality - I use it everyday
4.0,Love it but runs a little small
4.0,"I ordered this magazine for my son, so I never got to see the magazine nor review the content reading value. But he liked it."
4.0,"This watch band is great! It's easy to adjust and doesn't hurt at all. The only downside is that the pins don't come installed, so it's a little hard to put them in, and it's a little noisy when you move around. It's been a couple weeks and I'm used to the noise now, so it's not that bad. Overall, it's a great watch band at a great price point!"
4.0,Really pretty mustard floral! It‚Äôs a tad longer and bugger than the other size large maxi dresses I‚Äôve purchased of a similar style. You may want to downsize if you‚Äôre between sizes.
4.0,"the dress is beautiful, but somewhat small.  I usually wear a large, I ordered extra large and it fit tight.  I decided to keep the dress because I am working out and still loosing weight, so I know it will fit me eventually."
4.0,This is actually a super gorgeous top but I sized up and that really wasn‚Äôt necessary .
4.0,It was what I expected and it is good!
4.0,These leggings are super soft and comfortable. I did not give them 5 stars because they are slightly see through. So although they are great for comfort if you workout in them your underwear will be seen.
4.0,"Comfortable, stylish and beautiful.  I am well pleased."
4.0,"I have a pendant that has my Mother and Father's ashes in it, it came with a military style dog chain type necklace.  I purchased this for the replacement and it works, however the end is a little large to fit through the canister pendant.  I was able to pinch it and get it through.  I would recommend 2.1 instead of 2.4 so it slides a little better if you are looking to use this necklace in the same fashion."
4.0,"The color is more vibrant than in the picture. Its more yellow than mustard. Light material, runs a little large. Material is kinda ash yellow is my best way to describe it."
4.0,GOT THEM FOR GIFTS SO I HOPE THEY HOLD UP.
4.0,"Bought this for a DIY Luigi costume since you can‚Äôt buy one anywhere. Its pretty cute and will fit a range of adult head sizes, as there is elastic in the back. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it shows a keychain but mine did not come with one!"
4.0,I ordered a large and thought this tank was super cute but a bit shorter than i would've liked. also i'm aware that the dye would be a bit different on each item but this front had a bit too much dark blue dye on the lower half compared to what i would've liked.<br />still super cute and great quality!
4.0,"Loved the ring!! only problem i had was that the black came off fast. I get a lot of compliments on it though. 2 pictures when it was new and now, bought in 2016"
4.0,A little larger than the expected but it's ok.
4.0,Fits great. Good material. Didnt send belt.
4.0,Love it ! Just what I expected and arrived earlier than it should've
4.0,Like this bra and the price! Got both 36B and 36C for times when i gain and loose weight. Don‚Äôt really like the color but can‚Äôt find any other color for this model anywhere.
4.0,The foot size is true to size but the leg part is for a larger leg.
4.0,"It fit as expected, color as expected. I had higher hopes for it but it is pretty much as described. You don't have full function of your arms on this dress tho, unless you don't care about ripping it."
4.0,"These shoes are OK. Fairly comfortable, but just kinda bulky and loose."
4.0,"Really cute skirt, it is a bit see through, so make sure u wear something under. The skirt length has some give and stretches, but the waist does not. Overall it is a cute skirt for a night out. I haven't washed it yet, so I cannot speak of its durability."
4.0,"Literally, my top wig!<br />People asked if it was real<br />It fits good and looks great<br />I'm in love"
4.0,Kind of a sassy little thing to wear once in a while and the watch works just fine.
4.0,"I ordered the Besteel Punk Rock Leather Bracelet for Men Stainless Steel Clasp Wrist Bracelet 7.5-9.1 inches in the 7.5 inch size for my me, and the ends wouldn't even meet around my wrist.  I measured before ordering, and fully expected the bracelet to fit.  My wrist is only 7&#34;.  I tried it on my pre-teen daughter, and she couldn't get it to fit, either.  I REALLY like this bracelet, except the sizing.  It's quite heavy, the leather is very nice, and the stainless steel appears to be brushed and it is very shiny.  It looks just like the picture, which is what I'd hoped for.  I really like the clasp on it (if it's actually considered a clasp)...it is magnetic and like a puzzle piece, so once it has been fit together and attracted to the other magnetic end, it won't just come apart.  Aside from the fit of it, I really am impressed with this bracelet.  It seems to be great quality and feels like it will last a long time, even through daily use.  I think we'd really have loved it if it came in the size that was ordered.  All in all, it's a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bracelet like this, but I'd ask them to keep in mind that it is thick and heavy, and they might want to order an inch or so larger than they need.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in return for an honest, unbiased review.  This discount did not impact my rating or review in any way.  If you find this feedback helpful at all, please let me know!"
4.0,Looks solid and good product<br />My 4 stars is because it was missing the hardware
4.0,BEAUTIFUL QUALITY - GREAT FOR THE SUMMER-DIDN'T GO PASS MY CROTCH AREA.
4.0,"This dress is so comfortable. I love the feel of the fabric. It is a little thin, though, but not too terribly."
4.0,The material is very nice and the size of these masks are way better than the disposable ones. My only issue is that the seam is straight down the center and has a tendency to fold inward against your face.  But that is my only issue.
4.0,Absolutely love this band. It lost one star because it was way too long and I had to cut the end off to be able to wear it.
4.0,"Material is very thin, but overall as advertized."
4.0,These glasses are really cool but they are difficult to see out of.  They are surprisingly dark too.
4.0,Very nice looking set. Looks well on!
4.0,They were bigger than I expected but are very sturdy and will work for my project.
4.0,"It came really early. It looks exactly like the quality you pay for, but it passes really well for a simple addition to a casual outfit!"
4.0,"Sturdy, comfy, pretty good. A little overpriced, which I didn't mind too much (because they really are great while you're wearing them), until I learned that one of them keeps opening every time I shower. The hinge just isn't that great. Might be a fluke, and if you can find them for less than $10 each, I'd say it's worth it. I just spent $13 each though, and I feel like they should both stay closed for $26/pair."
4.0,"It is a really good wallet, but some of the pockets are hard to stick your credit cards in."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful, it fits nice. The material is a bit scratchy I wish it was softer but it is tolerable."
4.0,it was very cute . I couldn't fit it ima size 18 and I order the biggest size.
4.0,"My son loves them!!! He wears them daily, even to school... don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good idea, but he loves themüòÉ"
4.0,"I love this apron!! But I didn't give it 5 stars because the third time I used it, one of the strings came off, the one that goes around the neck. Nothing a few stitches won't fix, but still. All in all, the design and texture and otherwise durability is great."
4.0,"I had been looking for designer aviator sunglasses, and these were the most attractive looking onces I found to my liking and price range. The durability has been great so far and I can tell just by the structure that they'll outlive aviators purchased at wal-mart by 10X's. These shades have been a great investment if you have the same issue with the lifespan of your sunglasses. They're very attractive, and come to a very reasonable price. Especially when you notice how much money you have left after some time with these bad boys."
4.0,Really like these pants. They fit great!
4.0,"Despite the fact that this is somewhat large, it is still wearable.  I normally wear a medium/large in tops but seeing that this is made in Asia, I went up a few sizes.  Fine to wear with leggings."
4.0,"Absolutely love the shirt, fits as expected, and color exactly like the photo"
4.0,"This purse was a great addition to my Florida trip labor day weekend. It went with all of my sandals and outfits. It was flexible and it even stood the rain on a boat trip. It came with a dust cover also. It's up for the summer now, but I will definitely use it again next Summer. Good purchase."
4.0,"I love when others post helpful and complete reviews so I'm gonna do it.<br /><br />First I think sizing info is extremely important so let's say I'm 5'0, measures around 36-26-36. 34D bra. Weight aprox 125 pounds. I usually wear size 6 pants and small or medium in blouses depending on the brand /fitting.<br /><br />Given this and the other reviews, I chose size Medium.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-light fabric<br />-stretchy<br />-hug.curves (not loosy at all which was what i was looking for)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Material is a little too thin, so a bit see through  too (and I went with black)<br />-it shows every curve and flaw<br />-runs a bit small,  size up (I'm glad I did)<br />-if you have a little pouchy, wear it with some spanx or choose another version ruched<br /><br />All in all I gave it 4 stars. It is a basic, must have and the only one i found in Amazon, in stock, shipped by Amazon, my size, color and type (crew neck, bodycon type not loose) available. Good price too.<br /><br />I hope my details help and not like other reviews (i hate when people are too general)<br /><br />Xoxo"
4.0,I received mines today and was really excited about it but it's okay. The material is heavy (got mines in black) I'm 5&#34;2 and 130 and I'm going to cut off at least an inch and sew in the pockets. Don't get me wrong it's beautiful but the pockets are huge and makes you look like you got more hips. I'm very curvy and I have a lot of hips and thighs. Bra is 34D top feels good but once you look down below the waist it look weird. I'll wash it a couple of times before I actually wear it out to see if it shrinks a tad bit. I'll keep you posted.<br />***8/9 UPDATE*** Washed it multiple times and I finally stitched in the pockets and cut a quarter off the bottom and its looks and feels amazing.
4.0,"Really nice.... Got several compliments on it. Only thing is the diameter of it is on smallish side. So better for a more ""slender"" neck. But comfortable & well made."
4.0,More long than it is wide but it fits.  VERY warm.  Super thick.  Not something you could wear all day as a sweater or light layer.  Definitely use for outerwear.  But made good and definitely keeps you warm on cold days.
