1.0,There is no hole for a bun
1.0,Was not color advertised disappointed
1.0,This is a dupe.  I got these by accident but still tried.  Product is like water.  No coverage what do ever.
1.0,"If i could, I would give this zero stars!<br />These leggings were the worst material ever. They are extremely thin, and after one wash, they came out with numerous holes in them. The holes were small and i didn't realize until i was already out of the house. In middle of the day one hole snapped and the entire legging ripped right across my thigh. They weren't even small on me!!!!<br />I have multiple items by this brand and usually wear a size small. This was a medium, fit correctly, and all of a sudden the product rips on the second wear. I discourage anyone interested in this item"
1.0,"Bad quality, the label was removed. I try to take two photos and didn't allow me. So dissatisfied with this product"
1.0,Not comfortable to wear at all for me..
1.0,"This was the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.<br /><br />We used this luggage once and the biggest suitcase broke on the first flight of our trip to Morocco.<br />The suitcase was halfway filled (roughly 20lbs of clothing) as we were expecting to purchase a lot of things to bring back.<br />When we landed in morocco, the frame was cracked, one of the wheels was missing and the whole suitcase was unusable. Mind you, we now had to use this for 14 days and it didn't even survive being loaded onto a plane.<br /><br />I contacted customer service. They really did not seem to care. They offered to &#34;replace&#34; the big suitcase with two more smaller suitcases. When I explained to them that this is of no help (As we still have the 2 small ones and have yet to use them) and that we purchased this set specifically for use of the largest suitcase - they completely stopped responding to any emails.<br /><br />We're now stuck with 2 small pieces of luggage (that we cant trust to use) and a broken large suitcase.<br />It would have been more fun to light my money on fire than to deal with this crappy luggage and company."
1.0,Overall I really liked them but not even a month later I was taking them off and a part broke off. Not worth it.
1.0,His product started to fray the same day my son wore them. The fabric looks pulled and now can no longer use.
1.0,"Don't let the girl model fool you, I am 5/1&#34; 115lbs and this thing swallows me whole!<br />Def more suited for a man over 5/10&#34;"
1.0,COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH. The top elastic twists and is impossible to fix.
1.0,Received the wrong item
1.0,I wanted long tanks to wear under other shirts on and off the bike. These are not long enough nor do they stay put. I would not recommend.
1.0,Awful product!
1.0,Run about 2 sizes too small
1.0,Somehow both too large and too small?? The wait and was very tight and the hips and legs were very loose.
1.0,The fabric was soft and lovely but it's way to small for any babies head! Unless they are two days old. Looked bigger online. I'm so disappointed.
1.0,"Upside down There is also a small hole just below the neckline on the backside of the shirt. I love the shirt, if it’s I love it I would love to have the shirt fixed or whatever you think can be done."
1.0,I received this product broken
1.0,When i press the S on this device the suction level does not change...can you advice why?
1.0,"I spent over $100 for these socks for my girlfriend who has a genetic disorder where her feet and hands are always freezing cold.  They do not get warm at all, let alone hot.  She never uses them, they are incredibly uncomfortable and I spent over $100 for them! INSANE.  I wish I could have returned them but they were a gift and the boxes were lost! Horrible buy and to this day I am so disappointed that I wasted that much money on these pathetic socks."
1.0,All 3 products kept falling off. Until one day swimming in my pool it broke. Not even sure how that happens it’s supposed to be real gold.
1.0,"Fabric stretch and it’s white, no black legging at all, when you see it on you can see underwear. Cheap fabric and fading color."
1.0,"This is nothing like the picture. First, I bought it because I liked the ribbed texture of the material, even one of the customer pictures had ribbed material....mine was NOT!! Second, super cheap material and construction. It doesn't even have a tag in it, looks like the clothes my mom used to sew for me when she was first learning. Third, the fabric has a shine to it. Yuck, worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon...and I love Amazon!! now I have to wait 48 hours to see if they will ALLOW me to return it, since it wasn't Prime. Its not the money, its the principle that I was duped by these crooks!!!"
1.0,This shirt was poorly made...
1.0,If this dress was made better it would of been a great dress. They shoved into a small plastic bag. So that ruined the pleating and made my hips look huge. Also was sown poorly as well. Sent this item back.
1.0,Does not stay connected while charging.  I believe the Fitbit charge is a poor design for any cable charger.  even original didn't hold well.<br />I have to put tape on it to hold the connector on.
1.0,"I actually really like these. In fact, this is my second pair. My first pair went missing, but I wasn't too bothered replacing them. Unfortunately, the second pair I got just broke. No hard contact, no bending, it's as if they just lost the will to live. Maybe they're heart broken. Either way, yea they just sort of broke and I've only had them maybe 2 weeks and because it's a gloomy winter in New York, they had minimal use. In actuality maybe 3-4 times worn for short periods.<br /><br />Hopefully I could get a replacement on these. Haven't moved towards that option yet, so I'm not sure what the policy is, but these definitely did not break due to stress."
1.0,FOLLOWED INST. TO THE LETTER.......SPRAYED 5 SEC. AND QUIT.....DO NOT BUY ...REAL TRASH......WOULD NOT BE A GOOD BUY IF THEY WERE GIVING IT AWAY.....
1.0,"Arrived with one lens out of place and deformed to the point that it doesn't sit in the frame. Very frustrating, and totally useless. Am returning ASAP."
1.0,I received a scratched up pair of glasses.
1.0,They broke after just a couple of months. I really liked them while they worked but the rubber snapped and couldn't be used again.
1.0,Broke that same day I got it.
1.0,"Lots of sizes small, and cheap material,  and cheaply made,"
1.0,I ordered a black color and received dark navy blue. Not cool at all!
1.0,I won’t recommend this to anyone
1.0,"These are very very thin you can see through them & they are small very tight on the toes, my feet are very petite I wear a 6.0-6.5 depending on brand or materials made, these wear a disappointment.<br />I will not buy again."
1.0,Super cute- only had the watch for 1.5 weeks before it stoped working. Really disappointed
1.0,Flimsy ear piece plastic muff attachment broke off second time I used muffs.<br /><br />Too bad as it did muffle very well gun noise at the indoor range I use.<br /><br />Would return but that the muffs are past the return date.
1.0,So disappointed in this product. I wanted it to be a nice anniversary present for my wife and within a couple of hours of her wearing it her neck turned green. This is not sterling silver like advertised and my wife cannot wear anything but genuine .925 sterling silver. Do not waste your money on this cheap metal.
1.0,Purchased these to to attach various items to my vest while diving. They are incredibly cheap and the springs and clips break easily and does not stay aligned. I had three that broke the first time using them.
1.0,"It came broken and the clasp did not open. There were other problems as well, but lets just say, production values were not up to my spec. and the return policy is not one I want to go through again. They did offer to send me a new one, but I don't trust them anymore. Sorry, You have some very nice pieces, but I buy what I think will look good and last."
1.0,wayyyyy to small and extremely high rise
1.0,Magnet will ruin some of your cards
1.0,The product I got was cloth and looks every different than the picture that shows it as black shiny leather!
1.0,Me encanto pero muy grande siempre me queda muy grande
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this item. I was so excited about it when I ordered it, but when it arrived the clasp to hold the pictures into shape was warped and it wouldn’t close properly. It also looked really cheaply made/designed. It was intended to be a gift to my daughter but I had to cancel my order And pick out a different gift for her birthday. It was a huge disappointment. I received a full refund."
1.0,"Broke after one use, handle fell off cudntbopen or close"
1.0,It broke after 1 day
1.0,Cute but runs small. No room for anything(s).
1.0,Won't stay on watch. Only order if you want your watch to break when it hits the ground.
1.0,"I purchased these earrings and within two weeks of wearing one of the crystals came off the stud. Thought maybe it was a fluke so I had a replacement pair sent. The same issue, within two weeks of wearing them a crystal came off the stud. I do not recommend anyone purchasing these earrings."
1.0,"The handle is a cheap plastic, not intended for actual use (apparently)."
1.0,"I hate how when you tighten the straps that are poor quality they loosen up right as you put them on and the straps are like thin plastic that could break, DONT BUY WASTE OF MONEY"
1.0,I wear A women’s size 7 1/2  8<br />I bought these because they look soft and I like the color they fit great until I wash them now they look like baby socks don’t waste your money
1.0,"Don’t like the product,sorry"
1.0,Very poor w quality! Fell apart as I was looking at it straight out of the box!
1.0,The sizing on these is for women. And the zipper is on the left too. I returned it because a 3xl was the same size as the 2xl I have from another company. I bought these to wear over my jacket and that's not going to work.
1.0,Cute idea but poorly made. I ordered 5 and all of them the necklace chain was broken upon arrival.
1.0,Nothing like picture. It is pink not red and it extremely small. I order the Xtra large and normally wear a medium.
1.0,"I can honestly say I have never seen boots so poorly made. The seams weren’t stitched correctly. Stuffing was showing. Zipper wasnt stitched in good and threads are hanging. I had no option to contact the seller, I had to call amazon."
1.0,The unit only worked while connected to the usb source. The directions are not helpful either. No offer for exchange. Didn't want to bother testing the 2nd one as I figured these just aren't worth the trouble. Sadly just a waste of money and time.
1.0,Buyer beware! Don’t believe the false reviews- this shirt sucks —- it is cheap see thru fabric and does NOT look like the fabric/shirt in the picture. To add insult to injury if you order a non prime size -they don’t fully refund you! Don’t risk it!! Stay away from this shop!!!
1.0,Way to big and ridiculously cheap looking.
1.0,Too skinny didn’t fit my ear lobes cut my ears all up
1.0,Won’t fit
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture. It feel really cheap.  Not as shiny. Has really bulky rings on the heart to connect to the necklace. So yeah kind of a let down. DOESN'T LAY FLAT ON YOUR NECK OR CHEST it just faces down so you can't even see the heart shape.
1.0,It is not accurate. I send it back
1.0,Ordered for my daughter. Chain broke on the first necklace. Did an exchange. Second one the clasp was loose and broke. Sent it back for refund and bought her an initial bracelet. Bracelet is perfect.
1.0,Save your money! I know the price is tempting but you get what you pay for!!! Hem unraveled in the first 2 wears- I'll fitting on the top. Poor quality. Better off buying from a real retailer!
1.0,Incredibly cheap.
1.0,To use your headphone jack or CHARGE YOUR PHONE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER OFF.
1.0,Fit was not what I am use too.  Didn’t particularly like the fit
1.0,Typically wear a medium in everything even swimwear. Ordered medium and buckle was digging in uncomfortably near shoulder. Tighter fit then usual for a medium. Odd fit on cup area. If size C or above fit would be questionable. Returned next day. Well-made suit nonetheless!
1.0,sorry to give a one star but the workmanship is just not there
1.0,Does not even look like ad. Poor poor quality. Knew what I might be getting for that price but I was even amazed at how really bad they could actually look.
1.0,Ordering this watch band was a complete waste of time and money. Charms started falling/breaking off after the first day. Some of the links that hold the charms to the band separate easily and then the charms just slip off. Not worth it. Don’t waste your money on it.
1.0,No support material very cheap
1.0,"This dress is cut like a sheer, shapeless sack.  I would give it zero stars if I could.  The only thing going for it was the pattern."
1.0,"I normally don't do reviews but I felt the need to save people from this atrocity. Since I bought this item in July, the hooks for the bags have broken off, a few every few months. One broke on day one but I figured it was only one and I could use the other strap since the box comes with two straps. The plastic of the hooks is very cheap. The bags ranged from small (one being a fanny pack) to larger bags. The hooks broke off no matter the size. I will not be buying this again."
1.0,Super see through and boxy... not at all the material I was expecting. So sad loved the way the pictures look online but it’s just not what I was looking for. Will have to return =C
1.0,"The quality of these is super low. They’re cheap nylon fishnets, not at all worth $2 a pair. I was hoping they’d be fabric."
1.0,Bad not what was expected like children earrings wish I can get back my money too too too small
1.0,Should have known.  Looks like a piece of paper under a glass cabachon.  Not worth the money to return
1.0,I like the pattern but what I received is different style than the picture.  I should have ordered an extra large It fits tight on the top.<br />Also there is  no tags and no packing slip. I need to return it  I feel cheated!!!  I am going to have to contact seller  I have a feeling I’m stuck with it!
1.0,I am 5.9 and the dress is too short.<br />I did not like it the way it fits.
1.0,Had it for less than a year and not used often - but already falling apart
1.0,This top will fit a youth large not an adult male.  Be sure to measure shirt size to person who it is for because you will be asked to provide a photo of shirt with a tape measurer if it does not fit and if you want to return it. Returns are at your cost to China.
1.0,Very flimsy and thin. After only three months many of the wings are discolored and turning black
1.0,"These say they are &#34;autoclavable&#34; they are NOT. Shrunk and deformed in autoclave. Tried an extra one that I didn't autoclave and it was so uncomfortable, I couldn't even keep in it a day. Super disappointed"
1.0,"I loved the style but these did not last barely 2 months?! I love sunglasses, the style etc, but these are made cheap! I am not hard on sunglasses, I used the case every day and they broke while taking them off?! Really cheap and disappointing. I love them so much that I even tried glueing the crack above the right eye. But it does not work. I would not suggest these to a friend."
1.0,"This dress was so cute in the pictures. I was excited to wear it to work, but it is completely see through. I returned it right away."
1.0,Broke 2 days after my girlfriend pit it on.
1.0,"Disappointed that not only did the delivery date change to a later date but upon arrival, one was messed up and missing one charm (Elsa)"
1.0,"Does not fit at all like expected. Straps are super weird and the shirt is skin tight. The material is really ugly as well, looks very cheap."
1.0,"It is an awkward shape so it is really hard to put on. Also, I don’t think this is good as an earring"
1.0,Swimsuit is cute but the material is cheap and it runs very small.
1.0,"Cute set, but my grand daughter will never be able to wear it because the pink ran after the first wash. I wash everything in cold water. I have sprayed it with a stain remover, but it just continues to bleed every time I wash it."
1.0,"The ears were hot glued onto the headband and falling off, and the trunk is.... laughable.  It does not resemble anything remotely close to an elephant and literally made me laugh out loud its so odd and tiny. Waste of money!!!"
1.0,the neck hole was LITERALLY the size of an American girl doll head. the skirt was also too large. keep in mind i am very thin and 14
1.0,"This watch will not keep time.  Should have returned it, but I like the looks of it - have to set it every single day."
1.0,I returned this- it’s a cool design but not tye dye. It’s a design printed onto an athletic material shirt. It’s super boxy and nothing like pictured.
1.0,Strings to tie apron ripped off immediately. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"It fits around my shoulders, stopping short of my chest. I can tie the straps but it looks wrong. I'm 5'2&#34; Size 16."
1.0,Wheels are bent and won’t roll after 2 week of use. Waste of money
1.0,"So so so dainty, broke after 2 days of wearing. I loved it too. Too short and too dainty, you can do better trust me"
1.0,This is unwearable for me. It was wayyy too big for any of my toes but my big toe. But Toe rings are not for the big toe. This is more like a ring for your finger. But I wouldn't wear it as a ring because it's a little uncomfortable and almost too tight<br />Very disappointed
1.0,I originally gave the item 5 stars but after one week the product broke.  I called Amazon and they offer me a credit which I’m still waiting for my credit.
1.0,Looks like a colorful garbage bag with buttons.  Returned
1.0,doesn't work on some color blind people
1.0,Cheaply made. Had to use WD-40 on the springs to make them work and still are difficult to spread open to fit over glasses. Kicking myself for not returning for refund.
1.0,"Amazon wouldn't let me post my detailed negative review, so all I can say is don't waste your money. What you receive is drastically different from the picture."
1.0,"I always purchase slim fit for my husband, but this seemed like a regular cut."
1.0,This looked like a sausage casing on me. Way too small.
1.0,My grand daughter can’t wear this cute little outfit because the leg and arm seams scratched her because the sequins are sewn into the seams.
1.0,They got very weird. Got an XL pair I'm a men's 34 in waist and these cut off the circulation to my Hardy Boys.....and that's no mystery.
1.0,"I purchased the bra for my daughter her response was ""The adhesive piece for the bra did not work well... as soon as the bra was attached, it didn't give any lift and started to peel off on its own, was really  disappointed."" Now looking for an alternative."
1.0,Wayyyyyyyyyy too small
1.0,I bought the band just over a year ago I wore it may be 5 or 6 times and it just simply broke apart
1.0,Material is terrible.  It feels like a table cloth.  Not soft at all.
1.0,It never worked no battery when put one in the hands just hung there only spun in circles when moving arm
1.0,Disappointed. Band did not fit. There’s a gap between band and watch. Gave 3 stars for prompt delivery and packaging.
1.0,It looks good when I got it but looks like trash after one wash I didn’t even wear it
1.0,Not a bathing suit at all. The material is cheap and incredibly thin. The fit is bizarre and looked inappropriate on my toddler.
1.0,"So cute when it arrived and I tried it on, but so cheaply made. Every single Sean, starting from under the arms immediately began to fall apart. I'm 5'2&#34; and 108lbs so I was not busting out of it. It was so poorly made that it literally fell apart at the seams by 2nd time I wore it and before its first wash. Totally bummer"
1.0,This band got stuck in my watch!!!! DO NOT BUY. I am so irritated with this.
1.0,The clasp will not stay closed. It falls off my wrist at least 3x a day.
1.0,Not a bad hat just not at all what it looks like.... It's so thick / heavy it's not slouchy like the picture at all.... It's a very thick winter hat.
1.0,Some one stole the necklace for this
1.0,Loved it but broke the second time I wore it. Wouldn’t recommend
1.0,"Doesn’t fit on my bra right , it is super flimsy."
1.0,"The quality is terrible. Think of the cheapest sweatshirt at Walmart and it's worse. Material is thin and shiny polyester. The head hole is so small, my 12 year old had trouble getting her head in it. I normally wear a 2xl and ordered a 3xl just to be safe, knowing size issues.  It's so narrow in thr shoulders.  It's a no and a waste of money"
1.0,My daughter wore these for a week and then they snapped when she took them out. I’ve never known solid gold to break like this - disappointed.
1.0,"So these are truly cute & comfortable, unfortunately they're too long so if you're gonna bring the hem up,  you will lose the decoration<br />Unfortunately, though the embroidery is pretty the fit for a 5' 1"" person would not be a good fit. The height Of the person should be 5f 6"" and up Unfortunately on the description I did not see any indication of the length or the suggested height."
1.0,They both broke was using for swimming
1.0,Sending back didn’t fit right and clingy
1.0,"The ring is lovely, but it only cones in a size 6... I didn't realize this prior to Ordering"
1.0,"The style is very cute but while trying it on, the fabric just started to rip at the waist. I've never seen such a thing before. How could they sell an extremely damaged product like this! After this happened I went and checked the reviews of other customers and I was shocked to see soo many people had the same issue. Why are they still selling these tops? Wasted my money! BUYERS BEWARE!"
1.0,The metal clip that holds the Velcro strap broke on the first wear!  The other shoe broke on the 3rd wear.  Useless!
1.0,"Way to big, material was super cheap"
1.0,"I bought these in anticipation of breast surgery and found out then that all three bras are not the same size. luckily one kind of fit (although tight) and I got by, the other two were way too small and I could not even zip up the bra to close. I also developed a terribly itchy rash along the bra line since it fit so tight and high up on the armpits. My surgery went well but I am still suffering from theses rashes.  I did like that it had a  front zipper closure, easy for bandages changes."
1.0,"Size is smaller than expected, and bottom insert does not stay in place, it moves around when you walk."
1.0,"My daughter had these on, in the car on the way to an event, when she went to readjust the back strap. She was tightening it and the strap broke from the side. Since we had nothing else for her to wear we ended up pulling the back strap off both sandals and she wore them as flip flops for the day..."
1.0,"Does not look anything as pictured.  The part is like 8&#34; long, there was no variation of curl from top to bottom.  And it just did not look good at all."
1.0,"To tight in the sleeves, length good but not comfortable to wear with the sleeves."
1.0,Not sized right!
1.0,Wrong color was sent .
1.0,The zipper broke after wearing twice
1.0,This nose ring is not the surgical steel it is advertised to be. Have been wearing for a week and it is already turning copper and leaving a teal mark on my skin. As someone seriously allergic to cheap metal this caused my nose to get infected.
1.0,Dressed arrived torn! So disappointed was very excited about this I needed to wear this today for a Christmas party. So upset!
1.0,It's a shirt not a dress as stated just a regular tank top
1.0,It is extremely small. I am usually a M or L and ordered a M but it was a probably a XS
1.0,It does not stay open
1.0,"no es caliente, con la temperatura en 20 grados F. las manos se te congelan y no te las mantiene caliente."
1.0,Not quality fabric and sizes were way off
1.0,runs small and could not return...not return friendly
1.0,"Was like a nightgown, so thin!<br />Very  cheap Looking!"
1.0,"I really wanted to love this and ordered true to size but it was too big. Also, I'm positive I got a used item. In the photo there's a stain, cant tell what its from but the dress also smelled as if someone wore it and was sweaty, like a B.O. smell. Processed return the same day I received it."
1.0,"These are not 18g, they are 16g. Definitely not for smaller labret piercings."
1.0,"They dont seem like good quality at all.  Other makers feels better ,looks better.  I was not a fan at all.  Not really worth my time to return them,so ill just take a loss."
1.0,Wore it only 10 times and stitching started falling. Pity for others it worked so well
1.0,These shower shoes run incredibly small and narrow for a man's foot.  I'm generally a size 11 and ordered a size 12.  I can barely cram my foot into these shoes and when I do my heels hang off the back.<br />Size 12 is really more like a size 8 or 9.<br />I looked these up again just to make sure I didn't purchase a woman's shoe or U.K. sizing.<br />Awful!
1.0,Too small for big boobies
1.0,"Look nothing like described and larger than i thought would be. Very disapointed, would not recommend."
1.0,"Not what I expected. The dress pattern is pretty, but the material feels cheaply made. It is too snug in the top, but way too loose in the skirt. Definitely wouldn't purchase again."
1.0,It was cut weird. Cheap looking and way to small. It didn't look anything like the picture. Awful. Gave one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me give it a no star
1.0,"Size 7, fit my daughter was actually  (size 2 and 15 years old) way too small"
1.0,Inseam is less than published.
1.0,Beautiful shirt but this product is not accurately sized at all! I am 5'5&#34; and 220 lbs. I normally wear size 16-18 or XL-XXL. This shirt seemed like a M/L. I couldn't even get it over my head! It also ships from china and they make you pay for the return shipping. Not worth the risk if the sizing is way off and you end up being out money for the return shipping.
1.0,The hat came in a small box and was all rolled up and bent. I had to return because we couldn’t get the hat to look right.
1.0,"I ordered an extra large, 3 piece blue set.<br />What I received was black pants, no shirt, and a blue jacket. The jacket fits like a medium. We didn't even bother with the pants as they were very small. I won't order from them again nor do I recommend them to others :("
1.0,This was a waste of money for me but may give it as a gift to my tiny daughter-in law.  It is suppose to be one size fits all but it doesn't say fits all comfortably.  It was way too tight for my 40DD bustline.
1.0,The sizes run SMALL!
1.0,"Really irritated with this. Got it, used it, like the design, then the zipper broke. Like broke broke, I can’t fix it."
1.0,"Ordered larger size and like a ladies Medium and ordered xxlrg, waste of money when you have to give away. I never return I just find a person that wants."
1.0,"Bag was too small.  Expected big duffle bag, but it's like a big purse."
1.0,Ripped within a month of wearing. Return window had already closed.
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture!  There are only 5 stones within the heart and the chain is short - it does not unhook so if you can't get it over your head you are out of luck!  Will never purchase from this buyer again!
1.0,Not good quality. My daughter only got to wear it 4 times. The battery would not stay in place so my husband kept taking it apart having to put the battery back in place. Now the arm for the seconds has fallen off and is in the bottom of the watch.<br />Horrible. Do not waste your money!!
1.0,I'm very disappointed in the pic it doesnt show the fold over pants are that long I want a refund on cause advertisement they should of have a pregnant woman not a petite model I'm very annoyed and upset with this purchase and want a gerund back for false advertisement not happy at al!!
1.0,They rusted really fast
1.0,"I ordered the light blue and received  wash blue which is slim fit and not skinny. Not bad jeans, but definitely not what I ordered. I see similar reviews stating the same so this was a scam."
1.0,Sucks.
1.0,"I really wanted to like these. They are cute, that’s about it. The first time I wore them I got a hole. I’m very disappointed."
1.0,I bought the clear masks which came with 2. I wanted my baby niece to be able to see my lips when I talked to her. This was a terrible buy.<br /><br />It’s very close to the face and it kept fogging up. The material also made me sweat so I kept having to wipe it and readjust it. I would give this a zero if I could.
1.0,I received my product damaged
1.0,One came broken
1.0,It was cute bit the back piece kept falling out. What a headache.
1.0,"Ordered xxl,  looked more like a small in child's clothing.  No way this was an adult size ."
1.0,"This does not fit like I expected it to.  Not happy with this.  Very short, thin material.  Will be donating it, won't wear it."
1.0,"As soon she started wearing it  it broke, then she put on second one results wast money it looks great. Keep your money in your. Pocket on this one"
1.0,We order these ear rings a month and a half ago and still haven't receveied them I wouldn't recommend any buy to buy these we spent a lot of money on them to to not of gotten them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,I tried this on and put it right bag to return. Horrible fit. I am usually a size small on top and a medium on the bottom and I ordered an XL based on the reviews. The top was really short and the breast pads were in an awkward position. It is also very loose and not structured so you would need to wear a bathing suit top underneath which is strange since it has breast pads.
1.0,These shoes run way too large. Bought the size 12-18 months for my 13 1/2 month old. She will not be able to use these for a long time!!!! And not willing to ship back due to wait time. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It has snags and hole in it. Now I'll have to make a trip to other side of town to the UPS store. Afraid snag will get worse.  Hard to tell in photo.  But in light and on, it sticks out with my bigger bust size."
1.0,The product was poorly made
1.0,No size tag.  Way too small.
1.0,Very uncomfortable. I think they are just too small
1.0,"Item is not true to size. I am a size 16 and I ordered a 2X which should have been too big. I couldn’t get my shoulders into the garment, much less close it."
1.0,"The pouch is about the width of a woman's thong and is only ONE inch deep.  If you're buying these for your 8-10 year old son, these MAY fit just him fine.  The straps also curled up into thin strings after one use.  I have a 40 inch waist and the XL waist band fit fine for only one wear.  After that they just fell off, as all the elasticity was entirely gone.  Amazon shouldn't allow the sale of such junk!"
1.0,"Tissue paper thin, COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH"
1.0,Unfortunately  the waistband elastic is too tight and very uncomfortable. Another thing that happens is the elastic folds over from poor craftsmanship. I tried to return them but they offered me a 50% discount because it was not worth it to send back to China.
1.0,Magnets are not that strong and unable to be placed in many positions on your nose or lip
1.0,The item was too small and size was not as expected. It also turns out that I have to ship it back at my expense to an address in China and pay shipping costs that are probably more than the item itself. The return policy was not made clear at the time of purchase. I will never buy from this seller again.
1.0,I got a medium and it was still to small .. definitely would not by again.
1.0,They were not the size I expected; plus they are too short.
1.0,The first time I wore these they stayed in place for about an hour. After that they constantly fall down. After I washed them and ran them through the dryer hoping it would help it was even worse. Every step I took they were immediately falling down  around my ankles.
1.0,All broken within one day of wearing!!! Poorly made rubbish
1.0,"The time before you purchase less than five months, but unfortunately within water entered and now need to repair .. was written from the time it features water resistant"
1.0,"Should have evaluated the negative reviews more closely.  Bad, bad total junk."
1.0,this bag was cute at first but i ended up needing to wash it and most of the print washed off and the bag shrunk a lot :(
1.0,"Color bleeds; fabric doesn't feel like cotton.  I just washed the red one in the sink and watched the red color bleed out.  So, I discarded the water twice hoping it would stop.  Since it kept bleeding, I started again using all vinegar.  That seemed to work.  But, once I drained the vinegar and used water to rinse, the red bleeding started again.  Not good quality."
1.0,"I was excited for this dress but once I tried in on I realized it wasn’t for my body type. I’m 4’11,125lbs with a bit of a tummy so I went with a medium.  The top was a lot looser than I would have liked but the skirt part was a tad to snug. Wasn’t a win win for me so I had to return it and find something else."
1.0,lasted a week before one of the valves broke--total junk
1.0,This shirt was supposed to be a medium. I bought it to design as a gift. I made the shirt and gave it to the person and it’s totally not a medium at all. Now that I’ve decorated the shirt I wasted my money. Be very cautious when you order.
1.0,The size is 100 per cent off. Not worth the money.
1.0,Piece was missing so I can't use it won't stay up
1.0,One day of proper use and is already falling apart. Terrible quality.
1.0,Fits nothing like the pic unless u areva size zero
1.0,"This bracelet broke within a few weeks. I bought it in March, gave it to my daughter for her birthday the beginning May, and it broke within 2 weeks."
1.0,Too small and flimsy. Not mirrored.
1.0,It lasted me a week
1.0,they did not do there job
1.0,This is my second Todd Snyder I’ve bought from Amazon and my last. Both quit about a year after owning. Changing the battery did nothing.<br /><br />The symptom is that it just stops ticking. Tapping the crystal occasionally starts it again as does setting the time and replacing the crown.<br /><br />I wonder if it’s yet another fake on Amazon.
1.0,Fit is really wide and short. Daughter wears it as a shirt ( have to tie it up in the back to keep it from falling down in front) and after about 3 washes it's falling apart
1.0,Obviously I knew with the tyler of material it is that it wouldn’t have any stretch but man is this thing tight… i originally ordered my husband a 3x and had to send it back and got a 5x … still too small. currently looking into ways that i could add material to it to give it some give so he can wear it on our wedding day that’s less than a month away.
1.0,The shirt was too big so i requested a refund but I was charged the refunded amount back months after sending the shirt in.
1.0,"Way to long I could make another pair with the legs alone, too wideeee"
1.0,Very difficult to use.  I just threw it away.  I wore it several times but its too difficult to use.
1.0,The leggings look cheap and are extremely small.
1.0,"Cheaply made. Uneven, the clasp are very weak.. I am afraid to wear them for fear they will fall apart.  This is the first time I have bought from Amazon and there were no papers with earrings. I am not sure how to return them. Very thin gold but they look beautiful.."
1.0,"Ordered same product a few years ago.  Didn't like pressure in toe box, but they were ok.  Used my purchase history to order the same product.  I guess they changed the material for the socks.  They are not tight.  I'm not buying these again."
1.0,"Couldn't even get my foot in the boot. Extremely small, and my foot is narrow so that was very unexpected."
1.0,This did not help at all. I  am 36DD & this did not fit. Even when I tried it on it did not help at all. This is a scam. Would not recommend at all.
1.0,Too small....can't wear it.
1.0,I have some pants that are kind of like these that my mom bought for me. I love them so I was hoping these were the same ones. Nope! Couldn't be more wrong. These are TRASH PANTS.<br /><br />1.) Seam of pant waist has trim POORLY stitched and is flapping around outside the pants. Urgh its the first thing I saw and its unfixable so automatically I was disappointed.<br /><br />2. The ankles are practically boot cut.... On leggings this looks ridiculous. Maybe good for someone whose legs go straight into their feet and have no ankles. I mean these leggings are not even tapered even slightly. Nothing like the photo.<br /><br />3. The leggings are cheap and totally see through. Completely unwearable unless you wear a skirt over them. (that'll look real good with the bell bottom look the leggings have.<br /><br />10 out of 10 total crappola. Please don't buy these! Please refer to the photos my bf took for evidence.
1.0,There was a rip on one side of the shoe by the second week and they were solely worn indoors!
1.0,"I just got this in the mail today and I’m returning it ASAP. It is really thin, shiny like material that is see through. It has no stretch whatsoever and the dress is basically just a bag that has a ribbon to tie around your waste. It had thread already fraying at different spots on it too."
1.0,Item arrived with some broken beads
1.0,"This is a pretty and delicate necklace, but this style should hang much higher up. Returned with no problem."
1.0,This dress was cute in the picture.  When it arrived the dress was stuck together. Had to peel apart so stars were not good anymore.  Ribbon was not even and all frail at the ends. Bottom dress where hemmed was very loose and had already come apart. I sent it back
1.0,Horrible. Cheap. See through. Thin. Way too small. Not ture to size.
1.0,It was too small it's pretty at first then day two charms start falling off. Got plenty of comments about it when I showed at work.  We all agreed to small and whatever that was to hold charms on didn't work
1.0,I’m a size 6 And when it’s wrapped around my lates and when it’s wrapped around my  waist  it only covers one leg half of my stomach or my entire behind depending on how it’s position it’s very small would not recommend this product if you’re looking to cover up. I had to buy one from a different company so I can actually cover myself the way I want to.
1.0,The item came smell like B.O. also ripped.Material is see through.Won’t buy it  again.
1.0,It was small there sizes just depends on your body shape 😒 im disappointed because it wouldn’t fit
1.0,The outfit was cheaply made. Do not buy.
1.0,These arrived and I couldn't wait to wear them. After wearing them for a while one of the gems fell out. No big deal. But then I noticed the color changing. I just took them out bc I'm having surgery and PART OF THE COATING STAYED IN MY PIERCING! luckily it was pushed out by the one iness putting in! Don't do it!
1.0,Didn’t make any difference in colors
1.0,The thin material and poor workmanship used on to make this thermal underwear did not meet my expectations so I returned them.
1.0,"Too thick, hurts ears, can’t hear as well in the OR. Definitely don’t recommend. Many lighter hats out there that won’t push on the top of your ear causing pain throughout the day. I couldn’t wait to take it off."
1.0,"Well this was a miss for me, way too small and not the quality that I was expecting. MEH."
1.0,Read previous reviews and ordered it anyway.  I liked how it looked but arrived broken.  I'm very disapointed!!!
1.0,looks different than the photo says i am now using it on my dogs bed so he is more comfortable
1.0,I love the way this looks but after one day of wearing the small piece that holds the band together when the watch is put on fell off. It's not wearable.
1.0,"Their customer service is terrible.  The manager all but accused me of breaking them after 2 wears, the second pair, that I paid full price for.  That is how they make it right. They let you buy a new pair. Shoddy workmanship and no customer service makes this purchase a gamble."
1.0,&#34;Never Forgot...???&#34; Shouldn't that be &#34;Never Forget...?&#34; WTF!!!
1.0,Did not fit.  Had to return this item.
1.0,I did not like it at all.
1.0,"The quality of the stones on this bracelet aren't great. In fact, they aren't even the same shape. Some of the beads are shaped like a 5-year-old's multi-faceted plastic jewelry and some are just standard smooth round beads that you'd expect."
1.0,"I wish I could leave a 5 star ,but this dress came with cat hair and stains"
1.0,Poor quality.  Lenses cause star like abhoration as cars pass by from opposite direction.  Better off without them.
1.0,Color not as pictured. Said it was a light orange came pink as can be. Zippers not strong. Would like to return but return window was too small.
1.0,"The dress looks prettier in the picture than it is. The material is not very nice and it is simply a print, the dress in the picture looks like the fabric is dyed, it isn’t."
1.0,Dont like the shspe of this at all.  It has no arms amd looks very cheep.
1.0,Fell apart as soon as I unwrapped it.<br />Used super glue to fix it.  Cheaply made.
1.0,It opens on its own and fell off so many times it got lost.. i wouldnt purchase again..
1.0,"Keeps breaking, and now just can't be put back together"
1.0,The size is very largo y very small
1.0,"Bottoms were small, top was huge."
1.0,"I specifically bought this for the money clip design, however the metal hook doesn't hold any amount of bills securely.  Every time I'd open the wallet all the bills would fall out, totally an engineering snafu by someone who never tested the functionality of their design, got to wonder how they ever got their degree!  So I bought a pkg. of large fancy bobby pins, reshaped one to fit the wallet and now it works, money never falls out as it is securely held by my design.  Maybe they should hire me to design their product.  I would definitely not recommend  this product."
1.0,No stars... incredibly small fit. Poorly made
1.0,Material is absolutely terrible
1.0,"My wife bought this for an occasion but it was not at all pleasing it looks like you have hanged a piece of red colur iron in your neck, will never recommend it."
1.0,This NOT SILK<br />WHY IS THIS POSTED AS SILK<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1.0,"Buen calce pero la textura es muy delgada, no es de buena calidad. Parece producto de 2da calidad.<br />GRACIAS  por consultar mi opinión."
1.0,Completely see through and cheap quality
1.0,Super cute but I have an average size foot and couldn't get it over the bend in my foot to put on ankle
1.0,When this product came in it was only half put together and seemed to be missing pieces.  I ended up throwing it out.
1.0,All the rings were SO SMALL! I couldn't get a single one over the top of my finger and they are supposed to be midi rings!!!
1.0,Absolutely horrible quality. Looked good but broke within 48 hours of receiving it
1.0,Thumbs down. Material is cheap and see through. Was nice to refund payment but comes from overseas.
1.0,"The color is not even close, it’s red! The size is entirely too small and I bought larger based on other comments."
1.0,"it's fit like a glove,not true to size, and the material is cheap. I don't like it at all!"
1.0,Product had ink spots and pocket stitch was poorly done and see through.  Same issue with the replacement shirt they sent!  More ink spots all over shirt.  Poor quality!
1.0,Cute but damaged
1.0,I returned two defective masks by Nybee claim they only received one.  I’m not sure how to address this with Nybee.  Frustrating!!!
1.0,It says it's black but it's clearly navy in person. Bought an XXL but it was too small in the arms and chest. Normally wear a 14 pant and a 40DD
1.0,"These socks are much too small for an adult foot. They also are rectangle in shape, not contoured to fit a foot."
1.0,This ring looks cheap. No where on the ring does it say it's 925 silver. The yellow flower and crystal look cheap. The crystal in the center even looks like it is going to pop off.<br />It looks nothing like these pictures. I'm very disappointed. China can have their ring back.
1.0,"Complete garbage, arrived broken and is super cheaply made. They did refund my money tho"
1.0,Broke in just a few days.
1.0,These sox's are not for Big and tall men with circulation problem  in their legs or for working in for 10 hours a day
1.0,"Do not purchase!! I’m not sure how it happened but the “bra” I purchased from this seller was not what I first saw and purchased. Like another customer said, the reviews I saw were way higher so I’m not sure how this happened but somethings not right. As far as the bra goes, there is no way you can physically wear this thing for more than 5 seconds, and that’s if you can even get it to stay on your body. It is not only painful because it’s literally curved steel that you have to crush your body to get into, but the part that is supposed to hold your boobs in place is also a piece of hard plastic that YOU have to slide the cheap bra padding they provide over…steer clear of this torture device and save yourself the headache, pain, money and time!!"
1.0,The frame was bent when I opened the package and they sit crooked on my face.
1.0,I had to return the item as the size was too small.
1.0,I do not get what ordered
1.0,Way too small. I ordered the biggest size available and measured at a 46 so I ordered a 50 knowing they ran small. Got it and it was way to small. I emailed and they said they would make me another to make it right. So I ordered another 4 sizes bigger. So a 54 when I measured at 46. Got that one and it was only slightly bigger than the other. Don't waste your time with this vest. Go elsewhere
1.0,I received the wrong socks. I ordered the cat socks and they sent me the cartoon socks that look like food. My wife is very disappointed because she wouldn't ask me to order these socks. Low quality and very thin. Not worth the money.
1.0,Just received my Choppers night riding glasses and the foam padding is falling off on the right side
1.0,I bought this because it said 25% cotton & 75% polyester.  The tag inside the jacket says 100% polyester.  I would not have bought it if I'd know that.  It is misrepresented.
1.0,It smells and look like used one .<br />Super upset!
1.0,"Not only was this a month late, it is a piece of trash... I won't even donate it."
1.0,Size doesnt true to its size and printing of logo different from pictures
1.0,It wasn't 3 pairs it was 3 shoelaces 🤯.
1.0,Do not AND I MEAN DO NOT order this ring... I did and within 24 hours it turned my finger dark green I was so embarrassed... Not worth it...
1.0,"don't even....looks NOTING like the picture,,,its like a simple yard of fabric that looks NOTHING like the photos. Im upset that the fabric print is so totally different, Bad stitching, it just is a NOT HOT MESS."
1.0,horrible quality. Too short.
1.0,Fabric was see through thin. size 2-3x smaller than advertised
1.0,Cheaply made. Disappointing
1.0,I ordered a dress and got a completely different dress than pictures?? My daughter is pretty up set not very happy
1.0,"The product is nice, but I tried to order size Large, I'm certain what was sent wasn't large. They don't fit, too short and way too tight. I'm sending them back again. If there's a way to order Large, I'll try again."
1.0,"Very cute, but it broke within the first week of wearing it"
1.0,very disappointed in gown.  sleeves way too short and uncomfortable too!
1.0,It did not come with tags and came in a ziplog bag as if was used. The fitting was also way to large for a small.
1.0,Very poor quality...split in half on day 2. It’s a shame because it was a very pretty clutch.
1.0,"I did not like this necklace. It was grayish and did not sparkle like a diamond cut item should. I will use it to display pendants I sell, but I will not wear it. Disappointing."
1.0,This shrt is no good. Too small. Cheap as they come. And the company listing is a bunch of balony
1.0,Worst product ever!!<br />Amazon should remove this item.  It’s garbage!  Two out of four shoelaces so far lost the tips & have unraveled.  Junk!!
1.0,"Broke immediately. I realize for the price, it’s probably not made to last but I thought it would last a little longer than this."
1.0,Low quality. Ended up using it for a night gown
1.0,"I loved this piece of jewelry when I first saw it on Amazon and was encouraged by the good reviews. However, what I received looked NOTHING like the photo. It wasn’t shiny, and there was hardly any blue - the stone was nearly all brown. The pendant was MUCH smaller than I had I anticipated, but in all fairness, I didn’t check the dimensions before I ordered."
1.0,Lenses create distortion. Pretty much unwearable.
1.0,I've had my phone without a case for 6 months and just a few minor scratches. As soon as I put this case on it fell 1 ft out of my pocket when I sat down and the front and back of my phone cracked. I've dropped the phone multiple times without a case and it was fine. How is that possible?
1.0,"When I read reviews that this necklace was a disppointment, that it was cheap looking and not very pretty, I should have listened to them! It was a disappointment, and I'm sending it back!"
1.0,Cheap. Coating started peeling away almost immediately.
1.0,I bought this as a replacement for the original strap and it broke within 2 weeks. Don't buy this product!
1.0,"The dress was very pretty, the measurements were not accurate. Too bad, I really need a black cocktail dress. Will go to a store I can try one on."
1.0,"This is one of the items for which the phrase, ""you get what you pay for"" was written. These are cheap, ugly, and do not function .....the nose band is a joke and so are these masks."
1.0,didn't fit and they wouldn't return.
1.0,Would like to return today - missed the return deadline by one day
1.0,Horrible. The device used to shorten the band broke after I got the first needle out and there's no way to replace it. Then the pin to take the band off the device popped out. I've bought en multiple bands for my fitbit and have never dealt with a product this poorly made.
1.0,"maybe it needs a battery, but I was very disappointed that it just slowed down. I reset twice and did not keep correct time."
1.0,Not a plus size. Way too tight even for leggings.
1.0,"Dont buy from this seller, i want to exchange this and seller never replied back. It’s way to small not true size"
1.0,Would not recommend! I bought this item and followed all the steps regarding the care. Within less than a week it started rusting. I’m so upset I will definitely not recommend this. Save your money and invest in a pandora!
1.0,Very dissatisfied
1.0,Excessively Small
1.0,"I wanted to try to go cheap and buy a pair of joggers that looked good in the images, but this material is very low quality, and the zipper is very uncomfortable. Do yourself a favor and spend 5 more dollars on some champion joggers that fit well."
1.0,Not the one I got. Wasn’t much color on the one sent.
1.0,Quality not as good as expected for my 13 old son a medium.  Should have gotten a large.
1.0,"I don't like the quality or the metal pin. It works if you throw it in your pocket, but as a nurse, we need a clip on."
1.0,This dress and color are beautiful but somehow the stitching was off. The split was too high. The V of the chest area was too low with or without a bra.
1.0,Material is thin & it fits tight.
1.0,Disappointed. Broke pretty quickly with normal wear.
1.0,Super weird thin shirts that would be fin for a woman. But I ordered a men’s tee… and it’s just very girly looking
1.0,credit cards don't fit in slot
1.0,[[VIDEOID:48d45d12737d1e26afa5f2431b42c0b5]] Sparkley and nice quality on the front. The back doesn’t clasp shut so I cannot wear it on my shirt. The needle is also bent.
1.0,"My buttcheeks were showing, but the front was perfectly covered. Would not wear out."
1.0,I wish I would of kept everything to send it back. It doesn’t fit or look like the pic. Very disappointed with this item
1.0,"Good luck getting the right size.  I have received 3 jerseys.  Trying to purchase for my nephew who is 5'3"" and normally wears a Men's Small (leaves a little growing room).<br />*  Ordered a Men's Small - The jersey is HUGE and actually fits my other nephew who is 6'6"", 200+ lbs.  Seller did not respond to my email inquiring about sizing.<br />*  Ordered a second jersey in Youth XL - received a youth Medium instead. This jersey looks slightly big for a M. The seller agreed to send the correct size, which I appreciate (and did not ask for the wrong size to be sent back)<br />*  Received Youth XL - this jersey is actually SMALLER than the Youth Medium.<br /><br />I give up.  I have no idea how to receive a size that makes sense.  Unfortunate, because my nephew really loved the jersey."
1.0,Waste of money stone fell out very upset 😡😡
1.0,Too small to insert earring posts in.
1.0,I ordered an xl and got a 7/8?
1.0,Didn't hang the way I expected. Just didn't like the look
1.0,"I'm a pretty average size woman (160 lbs, 5'6, a DD breast size and ordered this in a L.)  It was so unflattering and tight in the chest.  It seemed flimsy and showed every roll.  No thank you."
1.0,Look bad
1.0,These are a joke.  Way not worth the money.  Inside of the sock the stitching is just crazy uncomfortable & will do the exact opposite of what you wanted it for.  If I could I would give it 0 stars.  Blister city!
1.0,I will need to return this product because the shoes are way too small.
1.0,I sent this dress back because the lines in the back didn’t line up.
1.0,"This product does not fit watch correctly and falls off, had it on my watch and it fell apart and I lost my watch, they sent a new one and it does not fit well in my new watch as well... will not use!  I asked the company to send replacement at no charge due to loss of band and watch they now want to charge for replacement.. very unpleased with product and service"
1.0,Pitch black is right.  Visibility is really low.  Too the point you can't wear them because you can't see anything.
1.0,Brought this in a light pink color. It was extremely see thru and I thought the fabric was itchy. Returned immediately
1.0,"Not sure if this is a problem special to me or if everyone has experienced this, but I only got one boob?! Even on the zipper bag that it came in it says &#34;pair&#34; but there is most definitely only one in there. So sad, too because it is a high quality enhancer"
1.0,"jacket sleeves are wearied they make crackling noises... and the jacket is sized very small you better order 3 times the size you want...size runs very, very small...sent it back for a full refund. would rate -1/2 star rating but not available"
1.0,Cheap Toy.
1.0,It was not as good that looks in the picture. Not covering my glasses also doesn’t stay.
1.0,Not so good for I.25%
1.0,The arm sleeves are super wide... Good as work sweater but the fit is off
1.0,"I bought this for my 5 year old, due to it states this is for a kid. Wow! The vest is huge and actually fits me. Needless to say we cannot wear it for hippie day tomorrow. I will definitely be sending this item back. I do see now that the measurement for the vest is listed on the online description  but how misleading to specify this is for kids. Also I see 1 more review on this item and the customer says it’s way too small, which makes me wonder if I didn’t get the incorrect size. There is nothing on the package or vest itself that indicates any information about the actual item or size."
1.0,I have twin girls and one of my twins is 25 pounds with fat legs and the other twin is a skinny 20 pounds with skinny legs. I wouldn’t recommend buying this for a chunky baby it feels like it’s cutting off circulation for my fat twin and my skinny twin it just falls right off her leg. But in general these knee pads don’t stay up I’m constantly pulling them up every 5 mins and it’s not enough padding to protect their knees while crawling.
1.0,came broken so returned it. pearls were coming off.
1.0,"Just don’t, fabric is crappy and look horrible on... anyone. Splurge get the good ones. Not these."
1.0,"I wrote an unflattering review & would like to undo & redo my review. This product does work, & it's fine."
1.0,Was sent two sizes too large and had a very strange cut.  Looked and fit nothing like the photo.  The material was cheap and scratchy
1.0,Did not work!!! Period!!!😡
1.0,After a week a put it on and I realized that it has a hole in the back
1.0,The zipper is too small impossible to wear it. I do not recommended.
1.0,"Keeps getting loose, its not wearable."
1.0,Broke in half. Poor product quality
1.0,"I received my shorts today & immediately put them on while I started cleaning around my house to test them out , & it didn’t make me sweat what so ever! My skin was dry to the touch , and I noticed my shorts have a tear on them in my buttocks area! I’m so disappointed I thought these would have worked out. They also are pretty stretchy from the leg area but once u button up to the top it does get a little snug & it doesn’t have a stretch wait area so it’s a bit restricted if u try to sit down in them."
1.0,This item was super tiny while cute it was barely noticeable.  I returned this item for a full refund.
1.0,They did not fit at all. Very disappointing. Not true to size at all.
1.0,"This shirt looks like a very wide crop top, nothing like the picture. Very disappointing. Not even the same color. Going in the donation bag. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Terrible fit! Tops is way big and the bottoms are way small! I usually wear a medium on bottom but I have a very large chest so I got a large. The top was HUGE and the bottoms are like an extra small.
1.0,I selected for a bigger size and I got something that can't even go close to my child size.<br />Not true to its size
1.0,The letters on front of shirt peeled right off sent the shirt back and got a new one and did the same thing !
1.0,"Way too small. My husband waited too long to try it on, assuming it would fit. Just pulled it out today to wear while watching a race. Missed the return window, now we’re stuck with a $40 closet decoration."
1.0,VERY CHEAPLY MADE. THEY COLOR IS MORE BRONZE THAN GOLD.<br />I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.<br />VERY PLASTIC LIKE MATERIAL.
1.0,"sizes vary greatly, within the same package. I am not happy."
1.0,"Not at all what I would have expected from this seller. 1st one sent was gold plated when I ordered rose gold plated, then the second one was tarnished very fast after receiving."
1.0,So small pendant. Bought it for myself but it is so small. Too small even for my 5 year old daughter. T
1.0,Bought this suit for my daughter. She was able to wear a handful of times before one of the straps frayed and broke. Expect to get less than 10 uses out of this product.
1.0,Save your $14 its cheaply made. Straps ripped! Upset because its a beautiful magenta n shape
1.0,These are way too large for a 1 1/2 inch belt. Maybe they would work on a 2 inch belt. A belt keeper is supposed to stretch over the belt to hold down loose ends. This one fits so loose it does not accomplish the task. I'm going to order the 1 inch keepers and hope they work. Nothing wrong with the workmanship or the sender. Just not sized correctly.
1.0,I reviewed the wrong hat.  Hat cheaply made.  Returned hat.  Looks like electrical tape around hat.
1.0,"Don't waste your money,one of the 3 came apart as soon as I got it,they are so cheaply made."
1.0,Not at all happy! I figured it would be a gimmick and they were. 29 degrees and my feet froze! Wool socks over the top of them and they didn't do anything! I strongly do NOT recommend them!
1.0,Didn't fit at all!!!
1.0,"Way, way too small!!!"
1.0,These glasses were so scratched and cloudy that they are totally unusable.
1.0,The size large is not for adults
1.0,These were bought for a man with shoe size 11. The page says men's 10-13 (even the zappo's site does too) but the packaging says men's 6-12. They are way too small!!!!!<br />But they perfectly fit my women's size 7 feet.
1.0,I only got the skirt there was no top
1.0,"I expected a dress people could not see though, you can't wear this dress without something under it. Not appealing at all"
1.0,"For $30, this was a rip-off . . . don't buy these shirts!"
1.0,What a rip-off...
1.0,"I would love to give this NO stars. But amazon doesn’t allow that. I had this watch saved in my “watch list” for a long time. After it kept coming up as unavailable I was finally able to order it. When it articles yesterday one of the metal clips that attaches the band to the watch was bent and not even in the holes correctly. And the wooden part of the watch that kept it in place was completely broken, making the watch completely unwearable. Sadly, I’m returning due to poor quality and broken item."
1.0,"Shoes are wide, but seem to run short. Needed to order 2 sizes longer than the chart indicated. Also, for the price, the stitching should last longer than 1 week for a kid, and there should be an insole. Won't order another pair."
1.0,Seller claims it fits Garmin Fenix 6 Pro. It doesn't.
1.0,Really small really flimsy. Doesn't feel like quality
1.0,This type of product is the type you should stay away from buying  online.
1.0,Very itchy even after washing this. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,Very disappointed they are not anything like what I expected
1.0,The heel ripped the first time wearing them! Waste of money.
1.0,"I ordered this item twice,  the white color changed at  the first wash! Then I ordered the second and same problem ,"
1.0,I have never been so disappointed with a purchase before. First thing is it took a month to be delivered when it said 2 weeks.(but not a big issue its the holidays) what got me is the fact that I ordered a large an i cant even get these things past my knee. Im 150 pounds 5’5.  I usually wear a Medium-Xlarge depending on the brand but WTF<br />This is not the childrens department there is no reason for it to be this small!
1.0,The item was broke when I received it. I ordered this for a special occasion and can’t wear it.
1.0,"The hat is extreme low quality, the insignia is more or less a sticker, not embroidered.  It may not have stated tat at purchase, so it could be my mistake, but the quality is so cheap, I would never wear this hat"
1.0,Beware! It says returns but they charge you to return and it goes to China!! $100<br />Ridiculous
1.0,the metal was weak and a chunk broke out when it was being cut.That made it useless.
1.0,This product is way to big it runs like 4 size to big so if your gonna buy this buy much much smaller
1.0,The lace insert at front is very itchy. I could not wear this.
1.0,"I loved this so much!  It is super soft and comfy and the colors are just as great in person.  Unfortunately, the first time I wore this in the car, my seatbelt destroyed the fluffy material and matted it underneath where my seatbelt laid.  I have tried everything to fluff the fleece back up to no avail, so now it has a big stripe across it that is super noticeable, so I can no longer wear it out in public."
1.0,Tooooooo baaaaddddddd material
1.0,The fabric of this butterfly lanyard was twisted both times I purchased it.
1.0,Even with the low price I expected more. It fell apart after one wash on delicate.
1.0,"Didn't work, followed instructions exactly, very carefully cleaned lenses, they were spotless, applied spray, let it sit for 20 seconds then gently wiped the lenses with cloth that came with it, put my glasses on, put my mask that I wear because of the virus, walked outside took one normal breath and exhaled normally and glasses immediately fogged up. Tried 3 times cleaning lenses each time with same results, each time I went lighter when I wiped the lenses after I sprayed figuring I might have wiped too hard, didn't change anything. I tried them in different temperatures 15°-50°, its winter, made no difference."
1.0,Medium is too small for a neverfull mm. About to return it and get a large. Hopefully large would work better.
1.0,Idk why ppl are saying this is stretchy. I wish I’d sized up at least. I’m guessing ppl like wearing form fitting clothes where the style of this should have hung a bit looser. I will not be purchasing from here again and will likely try to give this away to someone smaller or just toss it.
1.0,Very cheap printing quality .
1.0,"Design gets five stars, execution gets 0 stars.  No matter how good it looks, if I can't wear it, it's a total waste of money, it pretty much just falls off of my apparently smallish head.  The Cubs owner brought in people to get the baseball job done and obviously did a fantastic job.  The merchandise purchasing department needs a total clean sweep and get somebody in there who actually knows what they are doing.  The cap description in part reads &#34;fits most&#34; - translating that into real world English - we're only interested in satisfying MOST (not all) of our customers.  Really?  I have many baseball caps, some of them quite nice and fairly pricey and you know what, they're all adjustable through a variety of means, usually a strap of some sort and they work and look just fine.  So what exactly was the thought process here as to going with a non-adjustable cap?  Sometimes I just wonder how in the ____ some people hold the jobs they do, must be somebody's relative I suppose.  This is just a really sorry situation."
1.0,When I got it it was coming apart. I ave to buy a nail glue and fix it to get a wear. My money wast.
1.0,So very disappointed received this and wedding band had 2 stones missing.
1.0,"The inner zipper broke off right out of the box, before I even put anything into it. That was enough for me, I'm sending it back on Monday."
1.0,Very large for the face
1.0,earrings came in a ring box not the gift bag
1.0,Waaaaaayyyyyy too small.
1.0,"I washed it only once, before wearing it, and it was a wrinkled mess.....i couldn't wear it at all, I wasted my money, and I didn't return it, because I had washed it before wearing it"
1.0,"I ordered the shirt jn ""apricot"". Looked rather green online, it looked like baby poop brown in person. Not a flattering color at all!"
1.0,One pair immediately fell off the holster mounted on the phone and was lost. They pinch like hell.
1.0,Line has already pulled out of the rubber shoe that secures to the glasses. Very poorly made!
1.0,Defective
1.0,If this is a large dress and a small would fit on a baby doll.  Not even sure an extra large would fit a normal sized woman.
1.0,Bought this because it looked nice and sturdy. I have had it for a week and the handle/strap already broke. The strap got detached from the metal lock.
1.0,"This bag was a piece of garbage. I will say the bag was aesthetically nice, but the zipper broke the first time I used it. I took it to a shoe repair store to see if they could replace the zipper, and it would have costed me double what I paid for the bag. You get what you pay for..."
1.0,"Bought these for My daughter's dance group and they smell so bad!!!! They are beautiful and would work perfectly, but I bought 10 of them and the smell like a zoo!"
1.0,"Way too thin, see through and very very cheaply made. Returned."
1.0,No me gust&oacute; .dise q oro 18k pero parese aluminio.q desilusion.
1.0,Very bad quality!
1.0,Sending it back. Legs way to long
1.0,"The pattern is printed on, rather than woven in.  Looks a bit cheap"
1.0,This came way too small for my long torso child. She is 4 and I ordered what claimed to be size 7
1.0,Sent back couldn’t get band to latch!
1.0,Clips aren’t strong enough to keep lenses straight on your glasses
1.0,Ordered a large for my 16 year old daughter who weighs about 120lbs. She couldn't even pull them up. They fit like an extra small.
1.0,This was way to small. I am a medium but this was a child’s size for sure.
1.0,I bought this one size too large after reading the reviews and it was still way too small
1.0,I’ve had my belly button piercing for 11 years now and have never had an infection until using one of these belly rings.
1.0,Cheap made hat.
1.0,The fabricl was extremely thin and see-through.  This designer brand was disappointing because the material was cheap and transparent.  The pretty aquamarine color was ruined by this flaw.
1.0,They sent me just 2 t-shirts. 1 was missing and I didn’t like the quality
1.0,I have a pair of Nikes they are white and they turned a little yellow I soaked them over night and rinsed I might as well have soaked them in air or mabey just burned the money I paid for this garbage product
1.0,Very nice color but came apart from the chain in 2 weeks.
1.0,Advertised as non see through and the black you can see straight through.
1.0,"Arrived in a small plastic bag all turned inside itself, not the nice box it shows in the ad. So I figured well no box no biggie. Then I pulled them out to try them on. Who are these made for, five year olds!? Are there different sizes and I ordered the wrong ones? Don’t fit not comfortable janky design. I bought two others as gifts from a different place and they are really nice. Super disappointed because this was a gift for a teacher and now I have to reorder her something else"
1.0,It was just to large
1.0,I bought this because it looked like a product that I had purchased in the past. This shaper is made extremely thin and doesn't really shape. I tried it on once and have never worn it. Not the best.
1.0,Didn’t look at all like the pic and wanted this to be longer in length. Found out it’s made cheaply in achina too. All in all just lost out on some of my birthday money and won’t buy clothes from amazon ever again.
1.0,Sent back. Must have been for a stick person.
1.0,The smallest dress. I’m a size 6 and it barely covers me. Awful. And the packaging was a mess. Crumpled and looked used.
1.0,Gorgeous dress that’s COMPLETELY see through. Who makes a dress like this with no lining...?
1.0,"One boot has spots on it and worn down suede. The other had just the flattened, worn down suede areas. A shame since the boots looked nice otherwise."
1.0,When I opened the package I noticed an odor. Item had been worn. Completely disgusting good thing I didn't try it on.
1.0,Love the shirts.... but very disappointed! I ordered a set of 3 (XL). I actually received only 1( XL) and 2 (3XX) that were huge. Looked like it had been opened and stuffed back into the package not folded. Very fishy!!!
1.0,Does not look like the photo at all
1.0,I purchased these earrings based on the advertised picture. These earrings don’t look anything like the turquoise earrings shown. They are light weight and cute but knowing what they look like I wouldn’t have purchased them because the bright turquoise is what I was looking for.
1.0,Did not last. I only used it twice and water leaks into the gloves now. I was only washing dishes.
1.0,Chain came broken and earrings don’t close🤦🏽‍♀️
1.0,Just noticed that there’s a huge spelling error here 😂 IT’S (not i’ts) quite embarrassing that I wore  this shirt to a school full of educators.
1.0,not a fan
1.0,Many broke very quickly!! Didn’t have strong clips. Never buying from here again.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Very cheap and feels like a rain coat kind of.
1.0,It's not for adult its perfectfor a little girl
1.0,"This shirt was too small. Also, it was very, very poor quality. Very light-weight, not a nice finish, itchy inside and a very obvious flaw in the stitching right across the front of the shirt."
1.0,"Looks great till you get it wet, now it is a copper color"
1.0,"after less than a year of use, the metal wire began fraying, making it very sharp and dangerous. It’s not pleasant, it will draw blood if ignored.<br /><br />I don’t care how well it functions as a key chain, as soon as it starts stabbing you, I’m out."
1.0,Quality was very cheap and the sizing was way off.
1.0,Very ugly and the quality is bad... A real piece of 💩
1.0,Not as advertised<br />NOT 20 grams or even close.  Rip off. Tiny tiny tiny. Pissed.
1.0,The actual product doesn't look like picture
1.0,The side seems already have holes in them after 2 washes.
1.0,"Had to clip ends off, drill new holes and reattach chain"
1.0,"Its pretty but its too long, it hurts my ear."
1.0,Difficult to remove links<br />Very irritating on skin<br />Scratched heavily after first casual wear
1.0,"Looks great, but very difficult to remove"
1.0,Beautiful but broke after 3 hours of wearing it!
1.0,I am not a large woman by any standards but I do have breasts & a long torso. If you are tiny & flat chested then this is for you but if you have curves of any kind forget this & move on. I read the reviews before purchasing & based on them I purchased but they led me in the wrong direction. This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made.
1.0,"This was a one size fits most item and I can attest this isn’t true. I’m average size and it was waaaaaay to small. It was snug on my sister, who is a 6 petite. It’s a little “lingerie” than an actual dress.  I gave it to her and she’s going to use it as a bathing suit coverup."
1.0,You can see the attachment parts that are on the glasses when wearing them.  most irritating and I threw them away
1.0,Total joke
1.0,"Very attractive bracelet, however, mine broke within the first 3 weeks. Very disappointed. By the time I got around to returning it- it was too late. My loss, I'm stuck with a broken bracelet at the clasp. Debating on whether to have it soldered back together or take it as a loss."
1.0,"The quality is cheap, the thread is sticking out inside and out."
1.0,"runs extremely small,very tight neck, good graphics"
1.0,THESE ARE SO CHEAP! The shade color is more of a hot pink and it's honestly quite tacky.
1.0,"Earrings were very different sizes due to large &#34;bump&#34; on one.  I understand that freshwater pearls are not always uniform in size, shape, even color... but this pair was totally mismatched and I returned without hesitation."
1.0,"Not at all as pictured. It's not one size fits all either. It's much shorter than pictured and the material is not gauze. It is a thin, stretchy mesh. Very see-through. If you are needing/wanting exactly what's pictured, do not waste your money on this."
1.0,I really liked these shorts but I noticed a hole in the crotch had formed after only three times worn!
1.0,This 2x should have been roomy and loose on me-- but is way too tight!!!
1.0,They are made very poorly and broken almost immediately
1.0,"Top too small, bottoms fit but weirdly long"
1.0,Although the color was correct. The shirt didnt look anything like the picture. Ive ordered the same shirt before and it was perfect. Its not even the same brand. Very disappointing
1.0,Very cheapo quality.  Very expensive.
1.0,very poor quality material.
1.0,"Poor quality. Wanted to return them but, even though they were a Prime product I'm being charged over $5.00 for the return. What the heck is that???? Not worth the effort to return, will gift them to some poor soul."
1.0,Awfully small!! Not even good for kids. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Love the color, the feel, the style. But the first time I put it on, the seem from the neck to the shoulder split. Really buns me out."
1.0,Cheap& too small!
1.0,the item smells like barf…
1.0,This is a rag sending back. Not evening wear at all looks like pajamas
1.0,"These took a month to arrive, they are way too long, there is no mesh inside so they are not a swim suit, and the draw string is super cheap. These are awful in every way."
1.0,I ordered large so it would fit my husband who is a medium....<br />Large will fit a 12 yr old
1.0,They don't even look like that when u get them
1.0,like a toy
1.0,They're too hard not comfortable at all
1.0,It only lasts one wash. The zipper on the back also doesn't help the kid to remove it by themselves. The hat waa badly sewed. Hides the kid's face. Do not recommend.
1.0,It was so small! I ordered a medium and it was so tight.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:be709abce580b9584c932e4aef9b1c1f]] Haven’t tried the product itself yet, but upon opening the package there was a long thick hair on the lid from the inside of the nose. I tried them on also. They feel super short and didn’t hurt at all when I put them in like I can tell it will be easy to snag on something and get pulled out. So far not impressed. We will see though. I will continue to give this a shot. Just beyond seriously gross out by that hair"
1.0,Broke after trying it on. Very disappointed. Only had one setting. This would have been so cool to have.
1.0,Holes in the shirt but whatever I have to sew it!
1.0,"Does not fit a 40c.  Very very sad.  I really need a good workout bra, I was so excited to find this one.  The &#34;cups&#34; on the inside are way too small for a C cup.  I cannot zip up the outer support.  Will be returning this."
1.0,I ordered a Large and wear a US 10.5 and they are a perfect fit. What's not perfect is that the sole seems to be pulling away from the upper after less that a month of very undemanding wear. I bought these to replace another brand of slippers that lasted a year. This is very disappointing.
1.0,"The picture shows a maroon color but its really a bright red, the shirt runs small and the one i received had runs, Im very dissapointed, I took pictures of how i received it,"
1.0,I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry and it shrank at least 1 size.
1.0,Returned because it didn't have any type of manual with it and none was available on-line.
1.0,"Compared to my other plugs that are 00g these definitely are not 00g. They're more like a 0g, they're great quality just the wrong size entirely, they should be snug not fall out 🙄"
1.0,Returned immediately
1.0,"If I could give this shirt less than a one star, I would. My XL is like a small and because I rather not deal with sending it back to China I'll just give it to someone... Luckily it wasn't expensive. Also took over a month to get."
1.0,awful... I got a bigger size because I wanted it to be a lazy loose fitting sweater and it still was too small
1.0,the band broke after a couple weeks
1.0,"Terrible, not adjustable  as described ,  all the rings are fixed size"
1.0,It arrived broken!!! Pure trash! Do not buy
1.0,It's a flimsy piece of crap. Won't sit on my nose right at all and you have to basically destroy it to even try to wear it.
1.0,Not well loved...will probably gift it to a kid.
1.0,Chain broke in 3 days
1.0,Has  a strong chemical smell
1.0,"Plastic?<br />These are supposed to be HEAVY DUTY and they are PASTIC!<br />Seriously? Why...…?<br />They should advertise something about how strong their PLASTIC is so that buyers could make an educated decision.<br />Still searching for a quality, quick release keychain..."
1.0,I was misled by the 4 -5 stars ratings.. I should have paid attention to the very few numbers of reviews. This watch band is total garbage. The dimensions for the clasp is OFF.  After fighting with it for 20 mins I had to get a hammer to slighting reduce its length. I shouldn't have to do that. Potential buyer beware. ZERO stars.
1.0,"I thought this was a tankini, but I guess I should have read the description.  The shirt is short like a bikini would, and the pantie is really high waisted.  I didn't even try it on my 4 yo old, not what I was looking for."
1.0,This in no way a foat. The fabric has a seen a more like a polyester shirt. Also tyns very small<br />You can see right thru it.<br />Very disappointed
1.0,Broke the second time I tried to wear it.
1.0,I have had all size stones in nose rings.  These were smaller in the size described.
1.0,The waist line was way to high for me. And I'm 38c I got a large and it fit tight on top and to short. 177lb and a large was to tight.
1.0,Item was too small not what I expected
1.0,Really bad it broke apart not even a day after I had it on my keychain
1.0,shirt smaller than states.. had to cut it up n stretch it out to wear for bday 😑
1.0,"*This review is for the solid color baby pink dress*<br /><br />I can't speak for the patterned dresses, but the solid color pink dress is absolutely hideous, for several reasons.<br /><br />1. The picture shows a very, very light baby pink color, almost white. The dress I got is a bubblegum/cotton candy pink - super tacky. Ew!<br /><br />2. This dress is not made for women with breasts. The smocked top is supposed to cover your chest, then the dress is flowy under your chest - like a babydoll. But this is not how it fits. The smocked area is just not long enough to cover medium or large chests. I think an A cup will fit, possibly a B. Anything larger and you'll be popping out either the top or the bottom.<br /><br />3. The fabric resembles a bed sheet.<br /><br />4. The sleeves are attached to the dress by a thin stitch. Honestly, they might as well not be attached at all.<br /><br />A huge disappointment. I expected more from a $40 dress."
1.0,"I don't know if I just have too big of boobs, but this did absolutely nothing."
1.0,"Cheap quality, the gold tone is not flattering. Very bright and does not look like the color in the pictures."
1.0,These came BRIGHT blue to the point it’s an annoying color. They look nothing like the shade of blue in the picture. I’ll be returning them. #disappointed
1.0,"I bought this for work, but is fail. Uv protections is low, you stand sun 2 hours, eye will pain. I use industrial glasses (clean) eye don't pain.  And this Industrial glasses just $7 and cheap it."
1.0,"very small barely fits over one leg, and no I am not a large person."
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!<br />Complete garbage.. lasted less than 2 weeks before the stitches came out and it fell apart. By far the biggest piece of garbage I have ever bought from Amazon!
1.0,Not as cute as pictures
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:5e12712c5fe3f7bb9f7477766acba2a9]] Malisima calidad,  son muy lindas pero recién pude buscarlas y estan despegadas, no me las puedo poner hasta buscar un zapatero, que molestia tan grande tengo y ni siquiera puedo devoverlo porque aqui eso no existe"
1.0,"Very fragile, it broke!"
1.0,"This hat was more the size for a toddler! Also, I returned it weeks ago and am still waiting for my refund!"
1.0,Too large and not made well
1.0,"I wish I could give this zero stars. The ONLY reason I purchased this bag was for the separate shoe compartment and I can't even use it because the zipper won't budge. I put oil on it and everything! Super disappointed. I'll try to return, but I can see that being a hassle. Purchase another bag, don't get this one."
1.0,I dislike this dress it is too big
1.0,"Well, the watch band didn't have any arrows that I could find to indicate which direction to remove the pins and the tool to remove them broke in process.<br />The band really looks and feels cheap on top of all of that"
1.0,"I liked the product at arrival, however, my kids complained of not seeing clearly under water.  It didn't cost me extra to return it."
1.0,"I bought these for my mom because she was looking for star cuff earrings and they didn’t fit not only did the not fit they don’t work like at all, you can’t use them I thought maybe it was cuz my mom has big ears but then i tried it and it really hurt… we just threw em out and got star earrings…."
1.0,"Super cute earrings.. but.. as soon as I got them out of the package, they broke. :("
1.0,Waist of money. Bent after 5mins. Very flimsy.
1.0,Did not fit correctly
1.0,I’ve had other colors of these skirts direct from Toad and other companies and they fit fine. This one was way too large. Defect? I contacted this company but they wouldn’t accept returns.
1.0,"I loved the look of this cute dress, but ran very small, and I wasn't able to wear it, so unfortunately had to return it.  Also, the stripes ran crooked across the front of the dress, and looked poor quality."
1.0,Poor quality wore one time split in half and I have skinny feet/legs even too tight for my skinny 11 year old!!! Don’t waste your money!!
1.0,The material is cheap and the the measurements are wrong. Way to short for a dress.
1.0,"Got these and they are much cheaper looking than the picture shows. Not happy with my purchase. Company offered me partial refund to keep them. Otherwise I would have paid to mail them back. Can’t wear them, they do not fit. Very cheaply made. Probably going to Be donated."
1.0,Poor materials
1.0,Terribly sized not proper cut outs for any body type
1.0,It’s okay<br />It’s cute but faux leather hard to keep straight
1.0,"No me agrado en nada,casi ni se nota por el tamaño tan pequeño,es una falta de respeto,y ninpor el peso del oro vale lo que pague por ellos.<br />Muy deseccionado."
1.0,"My pin came broken and im unable to return it. Before buying it, it never said it was non returnable."
1.0,I highly doubt it’s gold plated probably won’t be able to wear it. The pendants are really big and doesn’t look as elegant and small as in the pic not happy with this purchase!
1.0,"Love the color option but too many irrelevant parts come with this with no instructions. Also after using a few times, I had to take my daughter’s glasses to get readjusted because it’s challenging for a kid to take off with ease."
1.0,The size chart is very off. Not a good purchase
1.0,I thought I was getting an xl adult size and instead I  got a boys.
1.0,"This shirt doesn't really look the same as the ones in their pictures. Both the neckline and waist are way higher than they should be.<br /><br />Also, there are a lot of stray strings all over. It just doesn't seem well made at all."
1.0,Wasted of money
1.0,"This seemed like a great purchase at first, but the color rubbed off after just a few days of wear."
1.0,"My son is prepping for a trip and I bought this organizer cause he ask for one and he started to put things in the big bag and when he try to close the zipper, it broke."
1.0,Not true to what website wrote.
1.0,"Total Chinese crap and deserves zero stars. I didn’t even have to take it out of the package for it’s essence of garbage quality to slap me in the face! Metal was scuffed, appeared to be rusting (so not jewelry grade metal), and the band casing looks like some form of cheap tape, hastily fastened. I am growing tired of Amazon becoming an outlet for cheap Chinese crap. I can’t even trust the ratings, which must be fraudulent. Amazon must have zero vendor vetting. It’s a shame because after years as a loyal customer I am truly going to go elsewhere where I can trust MINIMUM quality standards."
1.0,Way too big and goddy
1.0,The moment I tried putting it on my watch it fell apart
1.0,Worst belt ever.
1.0,Not as easy to put on as advertised.
1.0,It says it's metal....more like aluminum..and the chain is plastic. The thing fell apart on me 2 days after I bought it..
1.0,"It’s a very deep V.  The string to lace up in the back is like paracord, it’s too long and isn’t flattering whatsoever."
1.0,"The front of the waistband is facing the side of the dress. And of course the front side of the waistband is a larger helm in diameter. Also, the dress arrived in extra large, when I ordered a large. Poor quality control."
1.0,Very cheap looking and worried the metal will scratch my watch. Will be returning
1.0,don't stay in place
1.0,"this is a nice swimsuit.  However, I ordered based on the listed size chart measurements and I could fit two of me in here!  Awful.  Have to send it back."
1.0,"The fit is perfect, love the color. I put them on and one of the straps fell apart by just putting them on. I would say don’t buy hunk jocks"
1.0,"I ordered the dress described as purple and received a completely different dress than what I expected. Also the dress fits large, so I would order a size down. I’m 5’0ft and 144 lbs. I ordered a large and it was too big on the chest area, but perfect around the waist."
1.0,"In order to feel comfortable when sleeping I always order pajamas that are one size too large.  In this case I ordered woman XL because that is what the sizing chart indicated I should order.  However, when I received this order I immediately noticed that the bottoms were no where near a large let alone an Extra Large woman's size.  These were set aside and inadvertently got mixed in with clothes headed for the washer.  So they cannot be returned.  The waistband on these extra large bottoms only measures 12&#34; from seam to seam.  Stretched as far open as it can be stretched is only 15&#34;.  Sorry, but these are completely wrong.  On another note the washing instructions say - Wash separately - dry clean recommended.  I may be behind the times but who buys pajamas that need to be dry cleaned?<br /><br />I also ordered a pair for my husband at the same time these were ordered, which is indicating that it will ship sometime in January.  Can't wait to see how they turn out."
1.0,All of my bracelets unraveled or the knots fell off
1.0,kids not adult
1.0,horrible horrible quality. worst sweatshirt i own. one layer of the thinnest fabric ever. feels like a dance costume
1.0,This is Very small and Very thin.  I ordered a 2XL and it fits my size medium teenager perfectly.  Very disappointed.....
1.0,"This looks absolutely terrible!  Uneven, hot glue showing and just looks terrible.  Wish I could get it a 0 or negative star!"
1.0,The strap fell off before I even left the house. Poor condition. If you want to put a wallet and cell phone in it don't! the purse is not sturdy enough. The trap fell tore
1.0,"This company is excellent to work with, I liked several of the charms and will continue to get them from them, just this charm is not as good as the photo."
1.0,"The dress was pretty, but it arrived poorly sewn. Fabric of dress was sewn into the zipper and I was not able to zip the dress up. I will not be able to wear the dress"
1.0,Its cheesy
1.0,It isn't stone at all feel more like plastic. great colors but has a plastic coating on them like clear fingernail polish.
1.0,So....I overpaid for these. I thought they were cute but a few days after I received them I noticed that they also sold them in my local Dollar Tree😩
1.0,Cheap material. But It was cheaply made so. 😊... I never wore it
1.0,"When this arrived, I was shocked at how thin this is.  It's advertised as a sweatshirt but the fabric is no thicker than a regular t-shirt.  I purchased a large - which is always plenty big enough for me to wear over another shirt when I buy sweatshirts, but this top fits too snug even for me to wear without a shirt under it."
1.0,"This was made for a child or something and made very cheaply. I put them on the first time and they ripped, I wasn't pulling on them too hard either. Very disappointed I wasted money on these."
1.0,"I wanted to like this. I was looking forward to it. I used to have sweater vests that I enjoyed wearing years ago but they seem to have fallen out of style from the major brands. I have tried getting new ones from Amazon before, and I always found them to be of poor craftsmanship and VERY small. I'm usually a size L or XL, but judging from my experiences recently I decided to try an XXL of this one.<br />Well, the XXL just barely fits. Which is insane. Extra EXTRA large should be generous on me. It technically fits, but it is just tight enough that the buttons from my shirt underneath are suddenly very visible. I'm very disappointed. I wanted so badly to like this, but if 2 sizes too big doesn't fit, I can't say this product is worth much."
1.0,Extremely thin and small.  Looks cheap and we regret purchasing.
1.0,It was damaged
1.0,The crotch is super baggy and puckers up making it look like you have a penis. No thanks.<br />I wish I had taken a picture bc it was funny.
1.0,Item came broke
1.0,Way to big to be wearable. My head measures about 22 inches and this said it fit around 23 inches so I figured it might be doable with some small adjustments but it was just enormous. Also my face began to itch after wearing it and I’ve never had a reaction to latex before so I’m not sure what’s up with that but it was really bad.
1.0,Does not stay on foot and constantly slips off of heel. Other smart wool socks like this that I have purchased stay on my foot/heel
1.0,"decided to keep them. wore them first time today. they fit well except The wasteband itself is right.  the button won't stay buttoned and then the zipper won't stay up. I have a lot of leg room, but very stiff, not good for moving. I work in a prison. would not buy these again."
1.0,Ordered earrings (twice!) and got a necklace.  Did not get earrings- got starfish necklace the second time I ordered.
1.0,Had ink pen on it when it arrived.
1.0,Very thin jersey material that sticks to you and gets sucked in your mouth when you breath.  I would not recommend this mask.  Cute idea though with a different material.
1.0,Dress is pretty but way to small. I order a size 12 and it looks like it would fit a 6 year old.
1.0,It did not come with any bottom piece. It says one piece No bottom include or attached like a normal swim suit
1.0,The quality and look of this hat is on point but it’s HUGE! There’s supposed to be a sting to tighten it but isn’t one. Have to return
1.0,"These were delivered in a flimsy plastic bag with no box, and no protection, one of the screws in the nose piece was missing, so they were already disconnected and in 2 pieces s they are SO CHEAP. Like Alibaba made for .50 cents cheap and marked up to 17 dollars?! Crazy. I can’t believe they even tried to get away with this. Don’t buy stuff that doesn’t have reviews or mostly 5 star reviews. Ugh. Returning tomorrow!"
1.0,"I hated the bag! I was so dissapointed. It was bulky, heavy and stiff. But when i returned it, i got my refund for it quickly."
1.0,I opened the package and when I  put it on and the clasp broke it is not wearable
1.0,Didn’t fit into my earlobe holes!
1.0,"Runs really small.  I am usually a M-L (size 8-12 depending on the brand), so I ordered a L.  The dress doesn't even wrap around me, it fits like a 4-6.  I don't even think an XL would work."
1.0,I disliked how cheap the material is.
1.0,This product is not worth buying very cheaply made
1.0,Fell apart second time i wore it
1.0,This is advertised as The Sigil of The Archangel Samael for Courage and Strength Bangle Leather Bracelet. Well when you research Sameal. Sameal is a rebellious Angel considered the Angel of Death. It is not for Strength and Courage. Do your own research.  I didn't realize it till my cat hissed directly at it. Wondering why my cat would be hissing at it then I researched it.
1.0,"Good Grief, purchased this in April for my daughter and it’s falling apart 2 months later.<br />It held a lot, with many zipper pockets, that was why I bought it, big mistake!"
1.0,Not well made and buckle broke!
1.0,"TRASH MERCHANT: ""SCAMMER""! SENT SCRATCHED LENSES AND DIFFERENT ARMS. Broken arm. Merchant never sent an email when I complained. I maintain the audio conversation with Amazon, namely speaking with Daniella on September 23, 2020 at 2:59 P:M. Daniella clearly stated via phone that I would hear from the merchant by ""e-mail"" within two days. I never heard from the merchant, therefore I filed a claim with my bank card. Once the claim was filed, then I received an email from the merchant, past the thirty day limit. In this respect, ABC Liquidators is seeking to entrap the unsuspecting. I'm seeking a full refund and wish to file a formal complaint. All information has been fully documented."
1.0,Everything would have been perfect but it’s soo nasty already . All i did was remove it from packaging !!
1.0,"This is a medium, not a extra large. I can't wear."
1.0,I simply dislike this product! It is too thick and inflexible. It cracks easily and for the purpose of wearing around your neck it's completely useless. I don't have any real complaint for the seller. It was shipped promptly. It just is a waste of money. I haven't thrown it out because I'm stubbornly trying to find a use for it. But I may have to give up on that.
1.0,"I feel bad because the seller was extremely nice.  But his/her merchandise is just awful!  I'm posting a review because I was led to purchase these due to the OTHER reviews.  Either these buyers were sold a different sweatband, or they're friends of the seller and are lying.  I have been doing intensive, high-impact cardio aerobics for 30 years.  I have ALWAYS used sweatbands, even if in the last 15 years they haven't been &#34;fashionable.&#34;  I can't bear the sweat, particularly draining into my eyes.  These sweatbands are so thin, they are almost transparent!!  They couldn't be worth more than five cents each!  A Kleenex tissue has more substance!  Further, the seam is on the underside of the band, so when you take it off, you have a &#34;seam line&#34; dent on your forehead.  That's okay, it goes away fast, but my complaint is that there's virtually nothing to these.  I was stunned when I received the package and opened it.  Yet, I told myself &#34;all those reviews&#34; couldn't be wrong, so I decided to at least try one of the headbands.  I wore one tonight for the first time to a high-impact aerobics dance class.  The sweat poured down my back; the sweatband was useless.  I threw out the one I wore tonight and am giving the others to the Good Will.  Better to pay more for a THICK band that absorbs the sweat.  The whole point is to have no sweat--on your face, neck, nape--nowhere!"
1.0,The printed lettering on the front looks like a cheap home made job. Very pixelated and much smaller than shown. Kind of a bummer. The hoodie itself is ok but it starts to pill after the 1st wash.
1.0,"Purchased this wallet less than a year ago in August 2020. It states that it's leather. Hmmmm. As I zipped it together today, it just ripped apart on the sewn seam. I have attached a picture for reference. I'm so disappointed! I loved this wallet and got compliments from so many friends that wanted one just like it. I feel terrible now, because it just fell apart. I have leather wallets that I have had for years. They  have NEVER ripped apart like this. If I  could get it lower than one star 🌟 I would."
1.0,"This is a very bad quality, the Material became very rough and coming out in a short quickly, looking ugly. I won’t buy if I was you. It was a gift and now I am embarrassed because of the feet back."
1.0,Runs incredibly small!!!!  Sizing nowhere close to right.  Huge disappointment.
1.0,These gloves are useless when it is 40 degree and below.I wish I never bought them
1.0,These are only 20% wool not 38% as listed
1.0,See the photo. I'm so disappointed in the color. Its not even close to the photo of the navy top. How could anyone in their right mind look at that grey top and send it to a customer that ordered navy? Smh<br />Of course I'm returning it.
1.0,I loved the product color but the arms were at least 2 inches above my wrist bone (I’m 5’5 so I’m not tall) when I held the shacket up I could see through it because the material is so thin. This is definitely not something you’d wear except in summer. I am returning it…it was too expensive for it to feel this cheap and have the arms too short.
1.0,I would give it 5 stars but it came with the security tag still on it! So I can’t wear it cuz I can’t get it off 😭
1.0,Straps do not lock in place. Defective product.
1.0,Advertised as Genuine Leather. Seller should specifying that only the outside is leather. ( if it is in fact leather ) The inside of the band is plastic. Either way the band was too stiff to be comfortable. Returned.
1.0,Very thin not like other bandanas
1.0,Really liked these pants.<br />Until 3 weeks later a seam got pulled and then immediately created a hole there. Am really disappointed. Will look to contact seller.
1.0,Pineapple fell right off
1.0,"I was very disappointed, I was expecting 35 Below Socks.  I have had them in the past.  These socks are not soft and cushy, they do not have the 35 Below label on them.  I will be returning them.  Very deceptive description."
1.0,This was one of the most unflattering items I have ever put on my body. It was returned with swiftness.
1.0,Stone fell out on the first day.
1.0,"This sweater is not off the shoulder, the neck line is actually pretty tight. And the sweater is see threw"
1.0,was broken upon arrival
1.0,"Pictures look like rose gold, these are yellow.  Which I could look beyond but the one set seemed almost rusted! Has spots all over it so cannot be worn(I even tried cleaning it off but it’s stained) Very disappointed this is what $10 got me. I bought 10 earnings from another company for the same price and they are much better quality."
1.0,bro it broke in like the matter of 3 day LMAO
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Cheap
1.0,The top was fine.<br />Just not what I thought it was going to look like in person
1.0,Size 32 is very small
1.0,I loved this dress. It’s so cute on. I have worn it maybe 3 or 4 times. I always wash it in cold water and on the delicate Setting and hand dry it.  I pulled it out of the washer today and it’s falling apart at the seams in multiple places. It is very disappointing since I can’t return it and I feel I wasted money on this dress. I would not recommend buying this dress.
1.0,"Gold is bubbled like it was painted on, material under is extremely flimsy. After a months use they're bent. Very disappointing."
1.0,Don't waste your time.  They roll and ride up.
1.0,"Not comfortable.  Only one pocket.  Seams rub and these are made from cheap fabric, not for running or working out.  Don't buy."
1.0,Broke after first use. Waste of money
1.0,Unusual fit…banded at bottom which makes hip/stomach tight while neck is big and sleeves very long (and also banded?) Hard to understand what size would even work
1.0,I thought I was buying a Pandora charm.  It is not the quality that I was expecting. I requested a return postage label which was supposed to be received within 5 days.  It’s been a week and I still have not received it.
1.0,This dress came with the side slit .. They never mentioned they have a slit which extends upto knee.. Images also dint show... I ordered a teal color dress and even the colour is not what expected.. I ordered based on the good reviews amd really disappointed with the product...
1.0,Way too small for size 10
1.0,Bad quality. Washed poorly.
1.0,Item was much smaller than expected. Arrived with no tags and a used lighter with a burn mark fell out of the pocket when I took item out of box it was shipped in. Returned.
1.0,Cheap. It discolored.
1.0,I only received 2 pairs I'm missing 1 pair please respond back!
1.0,Just NO THEY LIED THESE ARE STILL ASIAN SIZES if I could give no stars I would now I have to buy another one and alter it I'm so upset
1.0,Do not order this item! I have asked through Amazon to return as it doesn't fit me right and is kinda big. The ruffle fits in a odd place! They said I have to contact the seller. No where in the ad does it state it is from China! I waited a long time for it. I am finding things from China are impossibel to return! I am trying not to order things from China. Yet how are we suppose to know if they do not state it!  So frustrating!! I hate having to keep items I do not want or will not wear!
1.0,Bracelet arrived with missing parts. Not like the other two that were in the same package! Disappointed because I waited 4weeks.  This  would have been very cute but it’s not good the way it is. Requesting refund. Sorry.
1.0,"This headpiece was cheaply made, the headband was flimsy and decoration pieces were falling off.  I don't have time to return since it is part of a Mardi Gras kewe costume.  I will have to repair myself, but I would not recommend this piece."
1.0,"Too small,fabric too thin, not happy"
1.0,Horrible Quality
1.0,"You would have to be a 6 year old for this to fit. I could only get them to the top of my point finger. Won't send it back because it'll be pointless but the rings are in the trash. They're are no use. Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. Would give 0 stars if that was an option."
1.0,"One size my foot. The leakage in this mask is terrible. It will not keep air and particulate matter out of your lungs. There were gaps at the sides, and at the bridge of the nose. The flimsy adjustable ear bands never got tight enough, and kept slipping backwards. I was coughing, sneezing, and wheezing despite wearing this mask. At least part of this may be because the tiny changeable filters don't cover the entire mask. Spend the extra $15 and get a real mask."
1.0,Not worth it. The bottom<br />Isn’t solid it’s just the thin vinyl. It’s really cheap. Would have been better to go to Walmart.
1.0,I have had great success purchasing items after reading reviews until NOW!  This dress looks nothing like the picture--the color is a lot lighter and the material is cotton (think cheap T-shirt).  I immediately returned this and headed to the mall!
1.0,Clasp came off the first time I wore it.
1.0,"the adjustable strap doesn't loosen much at all so it's hard for kids to get their feet inside. once they do, the flap that sticks up at the back of the shoe gets pushed down whenever my son puts them on; making them not only uncomfortable, but also interferes with the fit so they feel tighter. the only way to get these on is with a shoe horn. i did that for a while but then of course it got misplaced. i want a shoe my son (age 6) can put on easily. too bad, it's a great looking shoe."
1.0,Too big not what I expected tryn to get refund .....
1.0,Cant tell if they were good quality because they were way too tight. And I purchased the XL.
1.0,Run small. Shrink and fell apart when washed. Waistband falling apart.
1.0,No instructions plus not easy to use
1.0,It's a cheap looking piece of junk.
1.0,it looks really cheap like someone took cheap kitchen curtains from a dollar store and made a dress. do not buy. i returned mine
1.0,Mal producto lo mas malo que comprado en amazon
1.0,Size in listing says small/medium<br />Size I received was labeled medium<br />Extremely tight in the calves and LOADS of space around my torso.<br />Very ill fitting & was thinner than the other 3 I already own from other vendors.<br />For reference I’m about 110 lbs & 5’2”<br />Slim build with hips. Pear shaped. Slim calves.<br />The top part around your chest is also darker then expected. Roses aren’t as vibrant as others<br />RETURNED<br />🙏🏼Hope this helps someone else🙏🏼
1.0,Would probably fit my three year old granddaughter but CERTAINLY not for an adult!!
1.0,I ordered a Large but received a xxxL. I'm soooooo pissed
1.0,Bad quality. Came apart after receiving it.
1.0,poor quality sleeves ripped immediately
1.0,"These are so tight, I cannot get them over my foot.  Let alone on my calf."
1.0,Shoes rubbed MAJOR blisters on the back of both heels. I so wanted to love these shoes but don't waste your money.
1.0,I really like how this purse has so many pockets and is cute but the straps fall apart with three weeks of use. I’m disappointed because I really liked it.
1.0,I should have know that the photo way misrepresented the actual product.  One necklace was so shoddily made that it broke while I was trying it on.  And the actual products looked cheap as well.  I was so irritated that I threw away.  I was more mad at myself that I got suckered into purchasing the necklaces!
1.0,These socks are made of poor quality fabric.<br />First  one I slipped my foot into tore wide open
1.0,Seems to be of goog quality but way to small seems like it was for a child
1.0,The stick bend
1.0,"the neck fits a doll, not a human"
1.0,"The first time I wore this necklace, it turned black and turned my neck and blouse grey.<br /><br />I wanted to return it, but because I didn't try it on until after more than 30 days, I wasn't able to.<br /><br />Then I tried to email the business to give them a chance to make it right before complaining, only to get the email back marked that the email address was no longer any good .<br /><br />So I'm stuck. The way this is made, you cannot just slide the pendant off of the chain; however, I will have my hubby try to take it off and forge a way to put it on another necklace, that is if the pendant doesn't change to black as well.<br /><br />BE WARNED - IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY!!! ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE SELLER!"
1.0,They are so small.. I have my original one in 16g. And the ones I brought here are 16g but so much smaller you can lt even see it.. Very disappointed..
1.0,Some of them were good but I had a lot that wouldn’t even fit a few that were damaged and had to be trash
1.0,Tab was not there to pull.  Figures the batteries were dead.  Purchased new batteries.  Still does not work.
1.0,"Bird broke off chain, before I put it on. Looks pretty in picture.. Plus chain was too small for my  skinny neck. Maybe this is for a child."
1.0,Leather is way to thin 👎👎
1.0,"I wore them 3 times and sold them at a garage sale, because they hurt too much. I tried using stick-on cushioning for the heel, but they still rubbed near my toes. I do not recommend."
1.0,The lace was sewn in horribly.
1.0,"~""Terrible""~<br />~""Terrible material""~<br />Terrible design<br />No waste your money, if you have time for to go at the store please buy.<br />unfortunately the internet lie"
1.0,"How are they still able to sell this obvious scam product? After I placed my order, I read the reviews and realized I should’ve read them before buying. The first picture is a a complete LIE on what the ring looks like.  One of the other pictures at a distance looks more accurate. The skulls don’t have any visible teeth and the detail looks like a worn down image of what could have been. The sellers should be ashamed of themselves and are probably laughing all the way to the bank. I wouldn’t pay even a fourth of the price for this ring. A COMPLETE LIE FALSE ADVERTISING RIPOFF!!! Amazon should shut this seller down!!!"
1.0,very poor quality - many were off the ring or the rings were not closed.
1.0,"Bought these for my hubs less than a month ago, cracked in about 2 weeks. I noticed it while we were in the drive thru and heading home.. figured we'd just take them out when we got there, and send them back for low quality. ..Well..of course, they fell out somewhere in between, and you can't return or exchange what you don't have.  Point is.. the quality is terrible, dobtvwaste your money.<br /><br />oh, side note: the purple I ordered for myself (returned that day) is definitely not purple.. more of a very odd pink, and the balls don't match.."
1.0,Product is of a very cheap fabric. You get what you pay for that's for sure.
1.0,Material not at all what expected. Rough not a tee.
1.0,"for ""Adults"" but won't fit most children, way too small for adult faces."
1.0,My foot fits nice however the front part of the straps does not fit well! When I walk it feels like it’s going to fall off!  The thing is not tight enough!
1.0,didnt work
1.0,Everything about this dress was hideous. It looked like a costume dress for Halloween. I even bought 3x bigger and still wouldn’t fit. Not happy with return either. I paid with credit card and got refund back on gift card.
1.0,I returned the locket because the insignia engraving on the front was so faint that you could hardly see it.  It was very disappointing.
1.0,Grips fall off during 1st wear. Do not purchase!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS! The length of it only came midway if my calves, it is a way smaller fit, cheaply made. The only thing that they got right was, black, & the polka dots! 😭😬💔"
1.0,Bow tie was not in package when it arrived.
1.0,Xl too small too thin. 5’3 170 terrible fit.
1.0,the nickles is small than i thought and the earrings are really tall iamnot gonna wear them
1.0,"I just got it, I was so disappointed because the frame was curved even though I did not wear yet....so bad"
1.0,Arrive broken in the box at the strap end.
1.0,"These socks are more like youth socks. I wouldn't buy them unless you need them for someone who wears a man's size 8 shoe or smaller. Teens might like them. Still, they seem kind of expensive for the quality in my opinion."
1.0,I was very disappointed in the size of the earrings. The size on line was very misleading. The picture of the earrings were twice as large as the actual size.
1.0,Not a true beanie. Thin like a dress slip. Don’t recommend.
1.0,"I walk on pavement and rocky trails and after three months of daily use, these had completely worn out where they touch the ground. Might be OK for grounding indoors or walking on the beach, but not much use once they wear away."
1.0,These boots smell horrid !! To the point of being toxic ! I’ve tried everything and can’t get rid of the smell ….I can’t stand them in the house even .
1.0,"Well, at least this pair that I bought fits awful. The frame was crooked and was unable to get it exchanged. Love the color though."
1.0,Fits fine. Love the material bit it is NOT the same exact print as shown!  Very Dissatisfied
1.0,"One end of the clasp broke off the rubber cord on the very first time I put it on, not good quality."
1.0,the legs are way smaller than they should be.
1.0,"The pants are ok. Not happy when Isaw the price tag and paid 4x the amount, if not more."
1.0,"ehhh, not bad for the $, but not good either"
1.0,Not gold
1.0,Runs small. Ordered a size 10 but fit like a size 9
1.0,Terribly thin material and just not worth the price
1.0,Cheaply made product
1.0,"I love these, but the back is not good enough to hold the earring. I lost an earring shortly after I began wearing them."
1.0,"The first pair I put on, broke. The second pair scratched my ear because it has a burr in the glasses arm. I haven't looked at the other two pair!"
1.0,"The center stone fell out after a month. Upon returning the item in hopes of buying another, I was only given a partial refund despite the ring having ""In the (very) unlikely event that you aren’t satisfied, simply return for a 100% refund."" in the description."
1.0,These are very small fitting sunglasses. Not like the standard spy glasses you can get at sunglasses hut or PAC sun. These will give you a headache after wearing them for more than 10 min from the pressure. This is the second pair I bought thinking the first was a shipping mistake. It was not. Returned the last pair but had to pay 10.00 in shipping to do so. Looks like my son got a great pair of glasses and I will no longer buy spy sunglasses online. Lesson learned!
1.0,Please note that this is an international seller so shipping takes longer than expected and a refund may not be available.  The product itself is very flimsy and not worth the price.
1.0,"I purchased the Khaki color and it came in and it's yellow mustard color.  Now my daughter can't wear to school, total waste of money!"
1.0,These gloves run small and the finger pad need to use on the touch screen does not do the job as expected.
1.0,The picture shows a black on black tie with dino bones printed in the top layer of fabric. What i received is a black bowtie with dinobones printed in a green tinted top layer fabric. It doesnt match anything it needs to and since its from China and only $7 its not worth sending back. Waste of money unfortunately.
1.0,"This watch is a complete fake. It's not an authentic Tissot,let along an NBA edition! When I opened the box to put it on, it didn't even work! Touch the chronograph and nothing happens. The model numbers on the watch aren't recognized on the official tissot website.  If your not ordering from Tissot firsthand, dont order this watch via Amazon.  It's a complete scam."
1.0,cheap looking but kinda fuunyy
1.0,"Is all a lie. This are not progressive glasses. And the quality is the cheapest .. 99 cents stores have better quality than this. The photochromic also is not total, live about 50% . The is are the cheapest reading glasses I ever had in my life. I got it today and I want my money back."
1.0,ARRIVED BROKEN!!! MY DAUGHTER WAS SAD
1.0,If I could give these 0 stars I would worst product ever!! Not even big enough to fit in a nose they are very thin and small. WAST OF MONEY!!!
1.0,It was broken straps when I open.
1.0,The adjustment tool is cheap and doesn’t work
1.0,Absolutely awful. None of the backs fit onto the earrings at all. Totally wasted money.
1.0,"Wasn't expecting high quality metal due to the price, but the earrings aren't metal...seems more like a plastic-type material.  One of the bar/posts came broken, and these are NOT studs, the lotus flower piece of the earrings is way too big and looks goofy..."
1.0,On my 1st trip to Europe . The middle one came a part . When we received our luggage it was embarrassing . Not sure we lost anything or not. It was totally torn from the wheel area and opened. We had to through it once we got to motel and get new one. I will attach some pics in few days . They are on my other phone. Very disappointed.
1.0,Would rate this as no stars.. Two of the three shorts had multiple visible holes the size of a penny. Bought them for my husband but as soon as he wore them we noticed the holes. Very disappointed.
1.0,Shelit very bad. Not proportional forms. The impression as if workers did not have lighting when they worked.
1.0,Does not fit galaxy watch 2
1.0,These keys are comically tiny.  I expected them to be much larger.  I have no idea what to do with 120 itty bitty keys.
1.0,"This dress looked like a potato sack on me. Barely form fitting and all the way down passed my knees (I'm 5'3"") I am very disappointed."
1.0,"Trash. The fit was flimsy, it's a shirt. Cannot be worn like model in pic. No structure and not good material. Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,"I returned these, as the first one she put on ripped right away in two places.  She says its the worst purchase ever for such a product.  They took them back for a full refund.  Thank You for that."
1.0,Thin t-shirt material. Not what I expected.
1.0,After about a month this POS broke.. For a 17 dollar key chain you would expect it to last longer then the car. But after about a month most of which was spent sitting in a bag or hanging on a key hook (I don't carry my keys in my pocket all day) this thing broke. The main body just separated from the hinged part. Definitely wont purchase another one.
1.0,This product was delievered way too late (almost a month). Once i recieved that package and size was way too small than they said it would be. Size chart is off completely. The quality feels cheap and the print is very poor. Never buying from these people again. I highly suggest you look else where.
1.0,"This product fit width wise, but is petite in length.  The material felt and looked cheap. I was expecting knit and chiffon, but it is a single printed piece. Cannot compllain much for the price though..."
1.0,Cheaply made. Shrinks in the wash.
1.0,"I was really excited to get these sunglasses after reading great reviews. Don't be fooled, they are cheaply made and have a weird rainbow glare making them nearly impossible to wear. Very disappointed."
1.0,I hate this necklace! Way to big to wear around the neck. I hate it and need to return
1.0,"What a POS!  Didn't even make it through the first camping weekend!  If this company had any balls, they'd send me a pair or shorts<br />every weekend, so I could do my normal thing!  Loading back up, was too much, for this inferior product.  Getting off the tail gate, the seam split and I was down to my boxers!"
1.0,"I paid less than $5 for this and didnt expect it to look super nice, but this was the worst quality I have seen. A waste of $5.<br /><br />When I wear practiced broken I can not fix it."
1.0,It came three days late. Disappointed.
1.0,"No, it is NOT sterling silver, unfortunately...."
1.0,I am going to have to return this item
1.0,"Horrible neck line, not for big busted<br />Pretty print tthough"
1.0,I was really looking forward to receiving these but they turn out to be such a disappointment:(<br />They look nothing like the picture. These shorts are way too long and not flattering at all. The quality is straight up awful and the color doesnt look anything like the picture.
1.0,My daughter tried it on and three of the flowers fell off. They weren’t sewed good enough. Not the greatest quality. Very pretty though
1.0,It looked just like it was showed very nice but it was to larger so I had to send back I loved the length
1.0,Terrible!! what they sent is nothing of what it looks like in this picture!
1.0,"Item arrived on schedule, even though it took a while. Item was bought as a gift and she loves it. She had been using an earring stud for her nose and loves the little plug on the end to keep it in there.<br /><br />Only issue is the picture shows what appears to be a large butterfly when in actuality, the butterfly is extremely small. Think 2 grains of rice.<br /><br />Edit: Turned green a month after use. Extremely disappointed. NOT SURGICAL STEEL!"
1.0,To large and cant adjust. Paid $153.00 if I return they will only refund me $95
1.0,"Cheap crap, lasted one wash and started getting holes."
1.0,Disappointed in these socks. They did not keep my feet warm as advertised- my wool socks are way better than these socks.
1.0,"Received glasses broken, them came in bag, no box, nothing, broken!"
1.0,"Fabric is cheap, cut is boxy and arm holes are too big.  Gave it away"
1.0,I was disappointed when I received these. You have to figure out how to tie the lanyard and glasses together without it lookin weird. Then the lanyard is too short.  The glasses themselves are cute. I am attaching a better lanyard.I feel they are greatly overpriced.  I have purchases many readers from Amazon. This is the first time I have been totally disappointed.
1.0,Do not purchase this product. I am only 5’2 and they do not go up to your thighs as they suggest. On top of that they shed terribly.
1.0,My niece’s size is 13.5 so we ordered size 1.5 but the shoes were still too small. I strongly suggest buying at least 3 sizes bigger than the original.
1.0,No part of this has a hem. Did I recieve an unfinished shirt or something? Very dissapointing.
1.0,I was super excited to try out these leggings after so many good reviews. The fit and color were great but I did one squat to see if they were “squat proof” and the seam ripped. Super disappointing. Will be returning and trying a different brand that hopefully has better seam quality.
1.0,Not real.
1.0,Only on shoe worked
1.0,Ordered 5 only got 3 too small
1.0,"It's exactly what I wanted ... if I weight much, much less.  The problem with Spanx items is they're very hard to identify.  I have a couple of camisoles that it absolutely love, but finding more just like them is virtually impossible.  This item was much more constricting than those I already have, so it went back."
1.0,"Ordered the XL size and received a package of Medium. Ordered another set of XL and received 1 small 1 medium and 2 XL in same package. As I was unpacking and throwing into the washer, I heard a squeaky noise. I looked in the washer and there was a bat laying on top of them! What the heck!!!"
1.0,This shirt was so cheaply made which is understandable for the price. It had the weirdest fit! It was tight in the bust and arms and super big everywhere else. The fabric was so see through as well and felt like a cheap restaurant napkin. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Unless I wanted all the guests at a wedding to see my breasts, awful!"
1.0,"Cheap made item.  Flimsy and one pair was shipped with the nose bridge broken off and missing!  Two pairs ordered for grandsons birthday gifts, Only bought due to their request.  Even the boys were not excited when they saw these glasses!  Do not<br />recommend buying.  Go to the Dollar Store for a similar product."
1.0,My Sister never got it
1.0,Too small and shipping takes forever.
1.0,All three fell apart during first use.<br />Looks really cool though.
1.0,"I am not happy with the quality of this wig at all.  The way the hair is sewn on the netting is done in stripes, it doesn't stand up as in the picture.  The hair pieces fall over and leave bald spots.  7 of us at work bought these wigs as a group costume, and it's too late to return them so we will have to make due.  But not happy with the product at all!"
1.0,from China
1.0,"Extremely small. Bought the 10/11 year sz for my 50 pound thin grand girl and it does not even wrap around completely in the front, too short in the sleeves and neck area. Very cute as others have stated but really not suited for any useful purpose (warmth etc) fine to play in. I would have replaced but item no longer available.? I will make her a suitable robe."
1.0,[[ASIN:B008RDMZBO Oceanside Chain Ear Cuff Earrings Set Handmade]] very difficult to put earring in then cuff on & keep chain from getting tangled. ear cuff wouldn't stay on. a cumbersome item to try to wear. sent item back.
1.0,The front of the skirt is way shorter than the picture.  I'm sending back.  I'm 5 10.
1.0,Not a good swimsuit
1.0,"No. No. No! I want my nice cottony Fytto support socks back! These are slick, like opaque tights. Not thick. Not warm. When will the Fytto 4080 be available again, please???"
1.0,The shipping was fast. They looked pretty and was cool up until I put them on. the one pair broke immediately when I closed the clamps. It didn’t take much. Too bad...
1.0,wrist hole toooo small---sent back
1.0,Insanely unhappy with the lack of customer service from the seller. Ordered the green and pink dresses - both have gorgeous prints and comfy material. The green fits great however the pink is about a foot shorter and sewn funny. I have emailed the seller twice now about this in wanting a refund and still have not heard a word back going on 3 weeks now. Will never order from them again and hope they make it right.
1.0,I normally wear a 2X top but I ordered this in a 5X with the thought that it might run small. But even the 5X was too tight. 😢
1.0,SO I've had this a few months and worn the necklace maybe half a dozen times. It now has bubbles forming all around the bears. It looks horrible. Definitely cheap and great for a couple uses but is going in the trash now.
1.0,My daughter had this necklace for a week. She wore it twice and it broke.  The cording was thin in certain spots and it just split in half. I feel like the seller should provide a new one at no charge but I don't know how to request this.
1.0,Well it shows you get what you pay for! Cheaply made and very small will give it to my 9 year old granddaughter to play with
1.0,THEY ARE NO KNEE HIGH COMPRESSION SOCKS
1.0,Pants were completely see through even without putting them up to light. Went to return them right after opening. Disappointing.
1.0,"I donated it, not what it looked like on model. Looked more like for a guy. Not soft at all either."
1.0,It’s a really cute shirt but you really can’t wash it without it bleeding.  I washed cold on handwash with other dark items and the maroon bled all over the white.  Save your money and don’t buy this.
1.0,"Very bad plastic material, poor plastic lenses, easily breakable. Can't see a single thing, not practical at ALL."
1.0,"The fabric of this dress is super thin and kind of scratchy. It also has super thick buttons on the back that are very uncomfortable when leaned back on while wearing.<br /><br />On top of this being unflattering and uncomfortable to wear, the label on the back neck says ""Ripe and Raw"". I is printed onto the fabric and is not a tag that can be cut out. I do not feel like this is appropriate for little girls' clothing and I want to make sure to point it out in case a potential buyer was not aware of the brand and label. Personally I don't feel comfortable with my young kids wearing clothing that says Ripe and Raw on it."
1.0,Size ordered was was correct but size that shipped was 2 sizes too small. Was very disappointed in this order!!!!  Gave it away to a friend.
1.0,Found same strap that was thicker and stitched not bonded. Shark Nato strap is less expensive too.
1.0,"Strap broke on the first use.  I had hoped that these would work out, but the straps are not constructed well."
1.0,Arrived broken. Pretty disappointed that the materials couldn't hold up whatsoever despite being packaged fairly well.
1.0,Cheap could not open
1.0,Too small!<br />Subscription is incorrect on sizing. Order a size up..
1.0,Poor quality - rear strap broke 3rd time I wore
1.0,"As described by other reviewers,  this mask looks nothing like the picture.<br />Printing was off center and the image was too stretched out."
1.0,"I was really looking forward to this dress. I ordered it. And it didn’t come, didn’t  come. But, I was okay with that because the dress was exactly what I was looking for. Then I got an email saying they were sorry I didn’t receive it and gave me a refund. It didn’t sound like I had the choice to reorder or keep waiting, nothing."
1.0,It's cheap thin stretchy polyester and 2 sizes too small. Comes from China so there sizes of clothes are different if you do order make sure you get it 2 or 3 sizes bigger then what you wear. The stitching is done by a amateur. Front pocket top left.  You pay for what you get I guess China has decent cheap stuff but this is one that is falsely advertised.
1.0,Didn’t even use it because doesnt fit!! Looks useless! It was kinda mistake buying it. I hope i will be wrong later.
1.0,Glad adjustable but is easy scraped up when adjusting. The edges before and after adjustment is rough. Not really comfortable to wear.
1.0,"The face on this watch is so big it would only fit a large man. The quality is so poor I do not know if the clasp would withstand one wearing. This is almost a you don't even get what you pay for. Also, the time dots are black and not gold like they are shown in the listing picture."
1.0,Not good at all it doesn’t stay on the face
1.0,"It said large, but it was way too small, and I only am 135 lbs."
1.0,"This dress is straight up polyester. It's not cut the way it's shown in the picture. I'm 5'5 and this dress hits me mid calf as well. It's really only good as a house dress because it's so thin. So if you're looking for a shapeless, thin, polyester bag dress, then fire away. Otherwise, save your money."
1.0,"I never order anything without reading the reviews first but I must have forgotten that part when ordering this. That being said, I hope this helps others from wasting money like I did. I was excited that it arrived before the expected date and in the package it looked big. I immediately went to try it on and could hardly get it over my head. I normally wear a medium in shirts or hoodies but I wanted a loose fit so I ordered an XL in case it shrunk in the wash. These must be kids sizes and not adults because it doesn't fit at all. I'm hoping for a refund because I won't be able to wear. It's super cute and looks just like the picture but not true to size at all."
1.0,"I’m not sure why everyone is saying this mask feels great, because I’ve tried many different kf94 masks and none of them feel the way these feel on the inside. The mask looks fine from the outside and I love how there is a hook to connect the elastic ear loops at the back of the head relieving pressure from the back of your ears, but the texture of the inside of the mask just feels like plastic making it extremely unbreathable and hot when wearing it. I’m very disappointed in these masks because was excited to get some black kf94s since all of mine were white before. Would be returning them but honestly just don’t have the time to go out and return them anytime soon."
1.0,Don't bother
1.0,"Not really happy with purchase, it broke 2nd week of having it. I tried to use pliers to put the chain back together worked for a few days and broke again."
1.0,Need size options.
1.0,This will fit a newborn baby. Not a grown person.
1.0,It looks awful cheap and I can't even wear it. I don't know why I bother to order clothes online.
1.0,I’ve worn these twice and they’re already looking worn out. They’re super thin. I would never buy this again.
1.0,I never  recived  the  rings  and its  a  week  I don't  know where the rings  are<br /><br />Thank  you Marilyn Uolrich
1.0,Ordered a pink jumper and received a red one. Very clearly red not pink. Fabric is stiff and not nice feeling. It fits amazing if the fabric didn’t suck so bad and the color wasn’t hideous
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Don’t waste ur money
1.0,Awful and sheer.
1.0,Not Leather but Vinyl or Plastic type imatation leather
1.0,"We’ve only had the watch about a week, and it is already dead/not working. I know it wasn’t terribly expensive, but only getting 2 weeks use is not acceptable to me."
1.0,broke in a day. i loved the gold color but that was frustrating.
1.0,Ugly dress don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I agree with the other reviews that complain about the fit and the filters installed make it much worse!  These masks are worthless, not to mention that they are used to keep you from getting sick!"
1.0,It can’t be leather from any animal I’m familiar with... it looks cheap.. otherwise functional.. returned mine
1.0,"Get what you pay for.  Seams were horribly puckered, and would not straighten out, no matter what I tried.  I ended up donating it, without even wearing it once.  Sad."
1.0,They're not sized correctly. After an hour being worn the button fell off. No way to fix that kind of button. Not pleased!
1.0,"I wore this to my brothers wedding in July and I was very happy with it! However, the next time I went to put it on the clasp had a hard time staying shut and later in the day it started falling off, finally by the end of the day, it wouldnt clasp at all. It is so pretty I was bummed it didn't even last for two events."
1.0,No belt loops.  Poor drawstring. Pants too heavy.
1.0,cheap!!! Post broke while putting in the first time :( disappointing
1.0,Was way too small.  Ordered xl and this fits like a small
1.0,The product looks nothing like the picture. They were so thin you could see right through them.
1.0,To cheaply made and looks nothing like the advertisement
1.0,"Way to small the 6x is actually a 2x fit, which is too small for me but worked as a gift."
1.0,"bad fit - fingers wouldn't go into the glove all the way<br />when putting the gloves on, the cuff rolled up into the glove - hard to unroll them with the other glove so that they would fit into the sleeve of the jacket<br />worst pair of gloves i've purchased"
1.0,"Cheap Material, not soft"
1.0,"There's no way the XXXL women underwear I bought were actually that size. When I got them they looked like underwear for a little girl, not a woman. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Don't waste your time and money! It was poorly stitched, the  halter was uneven and the material was so flimsy!"
1.0,"Ordered a small, which is the size I normally wear, fit like a large"
1.0,Cheap can be used at Halloween at best.
1.0,The jacket was light weight and fit well. I noticed right away that the pockets are not well made. Stitching coming apart and you can see small holes where the stitching starts on the sides. So disappointed. I need this jacket for our trip. Sending it back
1.0,"Ripped after washing once, not worth it."
1.0,"Material is very cheap, looks like scrap material"
1.0,I ordered a 1x. There was no way 8 could get into them. Gave them to a friend who wears an 8. Fit her perfectly.
1.0,This tank is almost a perfect square. It’s shorter in the length and baggy in the chest and arm pit area. Returning for a refund.
1.0,This is not made for maternity or nursing. It's just a basic white cami.
1.0,The produce is too small for an adult. This is a toddler-sized bib.
1.0,Endeble
1.0,The quality is not as good as other brands I have gotten a similar sweater in.
1.0,These bras are horrible it do not Deserve a 1 star
1.0,"Its a piece of trash with a worthless light at the end of it.  It claims to copy information from remote controls so it can control your TV.  Why would you have the controls if you needed a new one?  Stupid, stupid device with the sole intent of screwing people over for cash."
1.0,"Although nicely packaged and seemingly well made product, the claim of reducing ""nighttime glare"" did not hold true.  Not sure if there is a better product on the market - if the technology exists, but this one does not work.  Save your money.  I will keep looking as well.  Disappointed for sure."
1.0,"What a disappointment! This skirt is made out of this bizarre, shiny and weirdly heavy material. It doesn't fall in a nice drape as shown in the picture. It sticks out. It reminds me of a 1950s cheerleader skirt."
1.0,The main zipper broke two hours into using it and basically made it worthless throughout the rest of my trip. Very disappointed as I liked the style of the bag.
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Did not like.
1.0,"Both pair of glasses had the same issue. The left lens reading area was a totally different magnification than the right lens, which was correct for my situation. The difference made the reading area totally unusable. Returned."
1.0,This top was simply awful! It a stretched out mess . A potato sack should look better!
1.0,"the bag looked old dulled and used, i returned it"
1.0,Should be listed as a junior dress
1.0,"They are all different sizes and very cheap material. My skin will probably turn green. And they press hard against the skin, so it would irritate me."
1.0,Clasp keeps opening and falling off my wrist.
1.0,So not sized for a kid.  We will not be able to use at all for my 4 year old way to big so ended up being total waste of money
1.0,"I am a custom textile dyer, and had to return these. They were advertised as being made of 95/5 rayon spandex, however, the content tag showed that they  contained polyester, which will reject my fiber reactive dyes."
1.0,I recently ordered a small pair of Secret Treasure PJ bottoms and they were just a bit snug and I’m a size 2 (in jeans) so I ordered a size medium this time. It arrived almost double in size and was extremely huge on me. I actually had to do a double check on the tag to make sure it said medium. Huge discrepancy in sizes. Sadly I’m now the proud owner of one pair that’s slightly snug and one that I can’t keep from falling off.
1.0,material is not seem to be as describe
1.0,Got smalest soze and itz way to bigamd  to wide for the newborn. The fabric isnt nice either.
1.0,The zipper was broken and the hole for the button was sewn shut. It took about 3 weeks to arrive and now I have to return them.  The picture  makes them look shorter and they are not.  Poor quality.
1.0,It broke all ready
1.0,Broke two days after we received it
1.0,"Terrible quality, broke with one wear."
1.0,The fabric is weird. The main part is fleece but the sleeves are a polyester nylon. Color is odd as well. Returned.
1.0,These tank tops are absolutely horrible. They have ZERO compression. I am a 34D chest and bought the small - still WAY too big. They are super thin and just downright junk. Returned immediately.
1.0,Not at all as pictured. Cheap and fake.
1.0,"The fabric of this dress is like a garbage bag--it's like taffeta, but stiffer and plasticier.  I bought it in black and the fabric somehow attracts powder, including powder from laundry detergent, chalk, and dust from the air.  I know that sounds crazy, but I wore it one time, I washed it and it somehow picked up powder in the wash.  I tried a million things to get the white marks off, to no avail.  Maybe you'd have better luck than I did.  But, I wouldn't buy this again."
1.0,The color turn to fast.
1.0,"The first time I wore this bracelet, all of the charms came off one by one. I wish I could say  it's because I was cheering hard for my team, but it's just a really, poorly made item. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Had to return. Cheap looking, wrong color and you can barely put it around your shoulder"
1.0,Junk quality
1.0,"My 6 year old got this as a gift , no it did not have a charging cable and after I charged it , it stopped working within 24 hours and never was able to charge again . It was blacked out and never came back on again ! So upset because my daughter really loves it so much still . Thankful for the thought but I would never recommend to anyone ! And for the amount it cost ! It’s hilarious !"
1.0,Tarnished and cheap
1.0,It keeps breaking. No good at all
1.0,"Fell apart at the seams, super short and small.."
1.0,"Product looks nothing like the picture. Quality and color are completely different. It was sooo ugly i didnt even bother trying it on. Needless to say, i returned it immediately."
1.0,"The color was not even close to what I ordered. I understand that the colors may vary slightly, but these were awful.  Colors were muddled together and overall very dark.  Nothing like the soft pastels in the photo.  As well, I am a size 0.  These leggings would have barely fit me.  Also, no drawstring as advertised.  Processing my return today."
1.0,Sizes aren’t right they run to small and poor quality fabric! Very disappointing
1.0,"this watch didn't work at all,  i wind it over an over again and it just wouldn't work it still don't work, i don'y no if its just this one watch that was defected or if others are exsperiencing the same as me,  with this product,  and i really like amazon but a few of there products i've bought didn't and does not work and this is one product that don't work at all  it just looks pretty but please don't ask me what time it is, i will be asham to say my watch don't work,  i'm sorry i had to say this cause i really like shopping  with amazon but  i,and i think i  speek for every one, we all really would love for are products  to work no matter what the price may be  please please please sell products to customers that work tha's the only way customers gone keep buying that product. on how it works for them and how long it last and holds up,  so yes this is my honest review opinion about this product  thank you."
1.0,The size chart is at least 2-3 sizes off! I am a regular size 8 US woman with a little larger bust and ordered 1 size larger. Couldn't even try to get the dress on.
1.0,"Super cheap, returned"
1.0,This took nearly a month and a half to receive. ..I tried to cancel but slowly it came and it took days to get a response from the seller.<br /><br />This material is very soft but super thin for the summer not fall. It's is a scarf that you would definitely waste your money on.
1.0,Both lanyards fell apart within three months of purchase. The thread came apart at the clasp. Poor workmanship.
1.0,"Cute, but broke in half the first day I wore it. It stretches open very easily just from regular movement which caused it to snap in half."
1.0,Didn’t even open it and it broke
1.0,"Stone popped out after a few days and i was fed up so i finally wrote this, dont buy this,cheap and bad glue on stone,pathetic"
1.0,We ordered a ten pack and got a package of 1 that was open and clearly never even had ten in it!  The mask is very thin and nothing I would feel protected in.
1.0,"I lost this toe ring during the first week of putting it on. SMALL is an understatement. The size is made for a child or baby, not an adult. Waste of money. I bought another, normal tow ring at the same time and still have it many moths later"
1.0,Does not lay or fit well
1.0,They were very cute and looked like the picture but as I was putting them on the very first time I dropped one and it landed in my sink and it broke. I have never been able to wear them.
1.0,"Small chain was broken at the clasp when I opened the package. So either I can wear it as ONE LONG pendant, and cannot later it as a choker and pendant which is what I bought. Very cheaply made especially the chain.  So basically I wasted my money"
1.0,This bracelet does not look like the pic - it looks like someone took a paintbrush of black paint and pulled it over the braclet- I was going to return it but I missed the return window - I love leather braclets but not this one - if I could give zero stars then I would.
1.0,"the nails got separated from the plate with the stone, because it is just glued to each other. I ended up paying another $20 at the jeweler to get them welded.<br />Later I bought smth nicer by Kate Spade for the total price I paid for these earrings."
1.0,Earrings arrived broken and unusable. Package had no padding whatsoever resulting in broken earrings. The antlers were broken off. The entire earring is cheap plastic.
1.0,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! ITS NOT REAL SILVER!!!!
1.0,The gold one had fuzz or dust or something sprayed over in its finish. Cheap cheap quality.  Worth about a dollar.
1.0,Mechanism start to make noise and became very wobbly
1.0,"Very disappointed. Material doesn’t look like this. On the top,, no stitching like it shows. T-shirt material."
1.0,Beyond disappointed. This bra is TINY.  I ordered a 32D which is what I wear in regular bra-sizes (and fit into &#34;large&#34; sports bras... but this cup size is seriously more like an A.  This is closer to fitting my 3 year old than it is me.  Now I have to pay for shipping to return the product?  Not happy.....
1.0,Had to throw away after just one wash due to extreme fabric discoloration.
1.0,"Poor quality junk, looks nothing like advertised"
1.0,Cheap made! The mesh is poorly stitched in and seams always feel uncomfortable and they show which looks bad<br />Unsatisfactory
1.0,"The latch was a bit tricky to get right, but the correct combination of spread fingers can get it pretty quick ones you have the hang of it. Unfortunately it isn't very secure even when new, but held most of the time. Good enough for non active use. Sadly as the band wore in the latching fit became looser and looser until eventually it could not stay on my wrist even when not moving. Now it's completely useless after a matter of weeks. Hard pass on this one."
1.0,I ordered an L and got a month later an M at most. No possibility of return or exchange (unless you pay shipping to China). Feels like plastic too
1.0,The belt broke 6 days after it arrived and Amazon will not send a replacement... Bad Amazon! Bad belt!
1.0,Absolutely horrible.  Cannot put them together easily.  Ends up as a weird oblong shape by the time you're done.  DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Gets faded quick with your own sweat
1.0,"Would have given this a zero star rating. Bought this same item twice, and both times the back part that goes into the ear completely fell off as soon as I took them out of the package with hardly any pressure on it. Have not had that happen with any other earrings. Tried twice to use super glue to adhere post to rose earring, and it just does not work. I gave up trying after spending way too much for these earrings. Cannot recommend them--very poor/cheap quality."
1.0,They have no effing clue about what exactly Length means !!
1.0,The watch band is much shorter than the original band!!  The fit is less than I expected.
1.0,Upset that I had the wrong item delivered. Now the dress is no longer available.
1.0,Not feminine at all. They are very masculine
1.0,"I have a typical Caucasoid nasal bridge and this has a &#34;stiff&#34; nose bridge area that just digs in hard to the point that it will hurt.  Had they added a few millimeters of length here, it would easily fix the situation.<br /><br />Second.  This google fogs badly."
1.0,Plastic sword not worth money
1.0,The lining ripped in the first week of wearing. And the pocket liner ripped a few days later.
1.0,"Cheap material, loud, terrible sizing."
1.0,Was nothing like the picture
1.0,"THESE SUNGLASSES ARE MASSIVE. I MEAN HUGE, I AM NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING. THE BOTTOM OF THEM ARE IN LINE WITH THE BOTTOM OF MY NOSE. SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED."
1.0,Cheaply made and falling apart
1.0,"The only problem is the zipper getting caught in the material, seems to be an ongoing issue they wish not to address. Update, didnt last 4 months"
1.0,"the gloves are really thin, I can see my hands through the material. They have NO stitched marks on top of the hands as described in the description. The length of the fingers are way too long. Not at all what I expected. Will not order from again."
1.0,"So thin and not leather as stated, although I don’t mind vinyl."
1.0,Ha! What a POS! Half worked when I first put batteries in.  Half worked when I replaced the new batteries with... new batteries.  Get what you pay for i guess.  Going to throw this into the river.
1.0,Do not waste your time or money. I got this and not only was it down past my knees but it had the most random seams at the bottom like they couldn't decide where they were placing the hem! Just horrible!
1.0,Didn't care for it not as pretty as it is in the picture which is a problem with Amazon tried to return it it was too late
1.0,These socks were extremely thin and didn't fit my son. I don't know how they could be men's socks when he wears a size 10 and they don't fit. I expected them to be much thicker as well. Disappointed but not worth returning. Looks like they will be headed to the donate box. His sister found these for him and was so excited because he had tried to find them at Universal Studios last summer and Harry Potter world at the part didn't have anything he liked. Oh well.
1.0,The heart does not stay still and just flops around. Mine only came with one rubber band for the side of the heart. Not sure if it was supposed to come with 2? But I am not a fan...
1.0,"A continued problem with Amazon is quality control. Nothing different here. I have a pair of 90 Degree pants, same style and color, that have lasted for years! These are see-through and the labels started peeling off after two washings. Not the same quality as my other pairs."
1.0,I bought size 12 for my 10 years old son. But the PJs seems more like size 6. Very disappointed. Good design but cheap material. I am trying to return this.
1.0,The color is not nearly as vibrant as it shows online.
1.0,Would give NO stars if I could I got the biggest size u can get & it is like a size L not 5x<br />Very disappointing!
1.0,"I've washed and washed, this is the second Winter I tried wearing these, they went in the trash, Itched me to death."
1.0,Was too big and you could kinda see through it so I returned it
1.0,"What can I say? Ew. Just ew. It is basically a bag. Litterally it looks awful. Is not form fitting at all, and has a pattern that makes it look so wrong that it’s not. It does not have a full skirt, it’s basically just straight down with the tiniest bit of flare, not even close to the photos. Awful dresses truly awful, so sad."
1.0,The pants ripped as soon as I put it on the top was to small it is not tru to size they run small
1.0,The  bottom of the sweater stretched out
1.0,"Ordered according to sizing instructions, but pants were still ill fitting. Returned for a refund which I’m pleased to say Amazon handled very quickly and smoothly."
1.0,"Very cheaply made, the light covers kept falling off and I was not doing anything over the top- drinking and sitting for our ugly sweater party. The hats were very cheaply made and looked cheap. Not impressed:"
1.0,The zipper doesn’t work. Very disappointed.
1.0,This was way too small. Need to order at least 3 sizes bigger than what you normally would. Very disappointed.
1.0,My daughter is allergic
1.0,When I got the product it looked great. Used it for 2 days. The magnets fell apart and the clasp no longer works. Tried to repair it and it still doesn't work. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,size too small
1.0,Suck!
1.0,Shirt looked nothing like the picture. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"Unless you are a size 4 and can pull it off like the model, anything above that will look like tight, long, cheap gym shorts.  Horrendous!  I have NO idea what I was thinking...  I am a size 16 and WHOA!"
1.0,This dress is extremely small and I went on size up when purchasing this item.
1.0,"This is the worst scalloped piece of clothing I've seen, the materiel is weird and almost looks like the little squares that would be on a thermal shirt,it's not smooth and when you put the top on, the scalloped part doesn't stay flush with your skin, it curls out."
1.0,Memory foam flattened after wearing slippers only a couple of times
1.0,Not as pictured.  Asian sizing for sure.
1.0,One of the camis came with a tear down the middle. The threads are coming apart in the lace area.  Seemingly cheaply made and I'm unhappy about the poor quality.
1.0,"Super thin, super small, ( I bought 2 sizes bigger than usual) I washed all three of them and threads were  every where. So disappointing because I can not return them."
1.0,Very very stiff material. The case is attached.  Overall inferior design. I am returning.
1.0,Colors from the display picture don’t match the product received also bag is way smaller in person.
1.0,"I'm with Review J.P.  These are very flimsy and are good for only one small key, so I returned.  I have several keys and need a coil stretch key ring that is sturdy.  I found them on Amazon for only $7.28 and they are nice, sturdy and beautiful colors.  JINGONGLYE 6 PCS Colorful Plastic Spring Spiral Wrist Coil"
1.0,DID NOT PERSONALIZE...not cool...came with the Mara Anne name as pictured.
1.0,The dress was falling apart at the seams. The front bow was hanging on by a thread and needed to be mended before we could use it and the skirt was very short and shear.
1.0,It is so awful. Don't buy this. I was really excited about this too. Fabric is shiny and hugs all the wrong areas
1.0,"It wasn't like the picture at all, looks like they has a big flaw on the right side where it looks like they were gonna make a pocket then flipped it inside out so now the dress has one rabbit ear, looks terrible, have to wear it as a nighty .. not happy .... sad!! Total bummed. Cuz i love them white one,"
1.0,"It is not sterling silver, the finish wore off.  I tried silver cleaner and polishing cloth to be sure. Nice design and size if you don't plan to wear it for prolonged periods of time."
1.0,Had to return this. It looked like beads for a school craft project.
1.0,Heavy and not as flattering as the reviews show it to be. Definitely returned
1.0,Would not stay fastened. Even after hearing it click and testing to be.sure it was closed. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I ordered a small. The dress fit like a XS . Didn’t even cover my butt. The dress was completely see through. The chest area was a joke. The dress was so small but yet the chest area was meant for someone with big boobs.
1.0,Product arrived very fast! Looks just like the picture but the wings are very sharp. Do not recommend for everyday wearing!
1.0,One glove ripped the second time I put it on. I haven't even gotten to wear them anywhere yet...
1.0,"Horrible! Do not waste your money. Washed once on delicate cycle, and elastic in waist and ruined... can not longer wear!"

1.0,Zipper broke the first time I put it on
1.0,Terrible quality and size runs way small
1.0,Quality was lacking. Fabric already fraid where the ties go through the waistband area. Returning.
1.0,"Lo pedí tamaño large, pero ni a un niño le queda."
1.0,"This is one case where going by the picture is more accurate than reading the description. I ordered ""orange"". Nope. It was PINK. Even the package said orange. I assumed wrongly that the color was off as can happen with electronics/monitors. Not anywhere near orange. Returned item unopened."
1.0,Turned my hands/nails black.  The elastic at the end ripped - didn't hold up for the evening.
1.0,"Looks more like a tent than a dress!! Nothing like the picture. Absolutely no shape and the material is similar to that of a kite. The colors are off too, very bright and cheap looking!! Do not recommend."
1.0,Was expecting more tshirt like material. The color didn't look the same. It was like ordering something from wish.
1.0,Too small and way to short me my taste.  The description said it was knee length but the skirt was mid-thigh.  the color was great.  not a good buy
1.0,"The arm holes were too big and sagged. The fit was unflattering. One of the shirts had a split seam and the company would not exchange it for a new one. I sent them all back for a full refund. I would not waste your money on these, as they are not worth the money at all! The quality is awful!"
1.0,Very sheer and see through. Also much longer than the model shows.
1.0,"This shirt seems to be a child size and was definitely a jersey material and NOT a t-shirt. If you want a skin tight, belly shirt, jersey then it just might work for you, otherwise I would steer clear."
1.0,Item is HUGE if that ia not what you are looking for dont get it. In addition one earring fell out as the back is made from rubber so it couldn't support the weight.  The stone fell out so i didn't even get to wear it even once
1.0,This product was asymmetrical and I believe it was defective. The right side of my dress was higher then my left side and was noticeable. The fabric was also very thin and cheap feeling. Would not recommend.
1.0,This item arrived with covered in black stains.
1.0,"I had high expectations for this hat. I ordered Havana Retro with the rope band and got whatever this is. It looks like some sore of cheap polyester band, but most definitely is not rope. Comes with a Made in the USA tag only to flip it over and see Made in Ecuador. It has just an incredibly cheap feel and the brim is so floppy. Looks and feels like something you would see for sale at a shady flea market for $5. Will be returning this ASAP. So disappointing."
1.0,TOOOOO SMALL NOT EVEN MY LEG COULD FIT IN IT 😢 I ordered a XL
1.0,"It isn’t the same product. I should of read the reviews. They are cheap, oversized and super thin."
1.0,"They fog up and stick to your face, not worth it"
1.0,Runs SUPER small!! Wasted money because it did not fit and my son could not wear it for Halloween
1.0,"Not oakley quality.  They are the right shape and fit in the frames just fine, but after only a few months of wear and tear they are coming apart.  Extremely low quality.  Will not purchase again."
1.0,"Basura ,no lo compren"
1.0,I received only the top part and it was a different design. Returned it
1.0,Too tight<br />Do not give when trying to stretch<br />Threads burst when stretched<br />I gave the away
1.0,The flowers on the front look like a baboon's face. Didn't anyone notice that when they made it?  On the front and on the butt.
1.0,"this dress looks good in the picture, but they always do<br />I found the fabric cheap, (i know the price is under 20$) but no one says, please let me but this really cheap dress so i can look bad in it......!  it was more like spandes/stretchie fabric and hung really poorly.."
1.0,Seriously looks like what you would find in a cheap Halloween store
1.0,Tree trunk bends and will eventually fall off. Not pleased.
1.0,Was not worth the money paid. Cheap thin creased material. Ends were almost frayed upon arrival. Could also see how they applied the flag portion on the ends. Again not worth the money they were asking I would have been more satisfied making my own with the money I spent.
1.0,This bracelet is designed for a very large wrist and the cuff is not adjustable.  Nice looking but I can't use it.
1.0,"PROS-<br />Shipping - was great! Arrived in half the estimated time it stated when I purchased.<br />Sizing - my daughter is 79lbs and is 4ft 5in. We ordered her the size 130 and it fit nicely.<br /><br />CONS -<br />The dress has an old basement smell to it. I didn’t want to wash and ruin the dress so I just aired it out but it didn’t help a ton.<br /><br />The material is super itchy all over so I had to purchase a bodysuit for underneath the dress.<br /><br />The dress was worn for 2 hours and the buttons were popping off. It’s not well made at all.<br /><br />For the price, I was hoping for a great well made dress and this is not it.<br /><br />RETURN- I’ve been trying to return this dress for about a week now and it’s like running in circles. I contacted the seller numerous times trying to retrieve the shipping label and to find out where I’m supposed to take it to be shipped. It seems like the seller has an automated system responding to messages because the responses I was receiving made no sense and didn’t relate to my question.<br /><br />I finally reported it to Amazon after getting nowhere with the seller and Amazon helped me with my refund. I finally got my shipping label and took it to USPS but was told I would be charged $29 to ship it back!! I’m in the US and apparently this dress came from China. I still have the dress because I do not want to pay that much for a return. It’s ridiculous.<br /><br />I have messaged the seller once again in hopes that they will provide me with a return address in the US.<br /><br />It is really a hassle and I do not recommend them at all."
1.0,Terrible it was the packaging it was dusty looking too fuzzy for the pattern.
1.0,Last a good five minutes before it wears off. Not worth it.
1.0,"Liked the idea and will send it on to people I know but this does not fit someone with a large head, it squishes your nose and is very uncomfortable. I am looked at ways to possibly increase the size by an inch. No, go."
1.0,Missing cups
1.0,It's not as curvy as it is in the picture and it's REALLY hard to open and close it. MAJOR UPDATE I can't take it off. My nose is swollen at this thing is hard to open. I can't get it off and it hurts so much.
1.0,Omg it runs super small. Couldn't close a button.
1.0,The charm fell off after a week .
1.0,"Don't waste your money. The round ball that goes through hole fell off, it does not screw on like some of the better belts do and, good luck finding it.. not that it will go back on if you do. The quality of belt seems to get worse. I’ve bought three of these belts.<br />First one looks great and great quality however, ball came off.. thought okay, I like the looks of it so, bought another one.. couple months later same thing, ball came off.. thought okay, third is a charge since the belt looks so good however, this was the worst of them all.. quality seems to be even cheaper and ball came off second time I wore it. .. now that I’ve spent $30 I could have bought a much better quality one that’s last far longer"
1.0,The colors are really off and the material is like a mix between thick long Johns and a dance costume. Very false advertising.
1.0,"Third time using, zipper split."
1.0,I have no idea what happened. My child has never worn these. Somehow the hinge has come of while in storage. It has warped so it cannot be fixed.
1.0,I received mine and it was broken and it’s senseless to send it back because you have to pay to send it back and I don’t have a key I have a money to pay for that
1.0,"This item lasted about a week before the chain snapped. No pulling on it, it wasn't kinked or anything. It just snapped from casual use."
1.0,"The item I received was NOT Sterling Silver as is listed.<br />I would have liked this item if it would have been Sterling Silver as described. What I received was not Sterling Silver, the item was clearly marked as Stainless Steel.<br />Had I received the item as described in the listing I would have been very happy with it - but this was not what I received.<br />Updated on 3/21. I have updated from 2 stars to 1 as this item is NOT as described and still listed as STERLING SILVER."
1.0,They were not wide leg. Fits like regular size.
1.0,I didn't know it was for a child.  I bought it in the women's section.  And it was an ex-large.  I don't even wear an ex-large.  I normally wear medium.  Where is Amazon getting these clothes from??????
1.0,It just didn’t flow the way it does in the pictured. It look more cheap shotgun wedding than bohemian.
1.0,"Does not work well, hard to put on and came undone quickly"
1.0,Couldn't get it to work at all. Mask wouldn't stay on right.
1.0,Package looked like the liquor was leaking out of the bottle don't buy
1.0,Scarf is very flimsy and sags easily.
1.0,This product runs alit smallsr then i expected i always get xl i like oversized tops with leggings and tights this is not long enough and fits like a medium
1.0,"Small, too small and cheap.  should have stated the size and weight.  Would like to either resell it or return it."
1.0,The outside casing came unheased and fell off when the person first used this Christmas gift.
1.0,This is not the dress as the picture shows. The back looks like something way out there. Its for a dance and now she has to look all over again.  Dont waste your time this company sucks.
1.0,Broke right away.  The color on the jewel faded almost instantly.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,I've barely worn it and its already falling apart. It looks great I really liked the aesthetic of this jacket but it didn't last very long.
1.0,The lave on the collar was frayed/falling apart right out of the package. Very cheap. Sending back.
1.0,Broke way to easy
1.0,"Can’t even rate length, or fit. That’s how strange this jacket is. . I am 5 ft 9”, normally 8, ordered a Large (according to the description). Well, the arms are long, well past fingertips and bulky for a body builder. The overall length is right mid thigh, BUT the pull string that should be at the waist is right under my boob! No joke. I guess if one has a torso with waist right under their boobs, it is a great fit. For the rest of us human shaped women, this is a definite NO. I ended up keeping it just as a memento of the strangest item from China to date!"
1.0,I'm sure it would fit if i tried it on but its the wrong color i ordered blue that would glow in the dark the other option was yellow and the one i got is white
1.0,Too girly the picture I saw showed a manly bag when I got it it’s a girl’s clutch
1.0,Ya know those pants that Justin Bieber wears? The one that makes it look like he’s wearing a saggy diaper… yeah that’s these… but with shorter legs. Definitely the ugliest pair of pants I’ve ever seen lol
1.0,"Of poor quality, cheaply made and thin. They were returned."
1.0,Not as listed.
1.0,The picture looks misleading because I was expecting something at least the size of a dime.
1.0,don't like it at all and it took 21 days before I got it
1.0,"Do not buy this, it was a complete scam. Received really weird bra, not even close to the picture"
1.0,Looks like the character in the show but the fabric is cheap and it doesn’t keep you warm.
1.0,Floppy rubbery plastic material. Not rigid at all! Not as advertised. :(
1.0,"Very poorly made crooked seams,  material itchy,  and was suppose to be 1X no way, so bad they didn't even want it back, I attempted to return and they refunded me and told me to just keep it.  Buyer beware!!!!!"
1.0,"Very disappointed. There were two massive holes on the left side upon arrival, and the sewing assistance white mesh was visible under the bust. The dress was so perfect in the picture but arrived ruined!"
1.0,"Terrible quality. Made with one sided printed fabric, and elastic type material so white background comes through. No label. I really think this item is over-priced. Item arrived on-time."
1.0,"Its horrible, the measurement of the waist isn't right."
1.0,"odd shaped by the boobs.  maybe I need a smaller size, but it's cheapy material"
1.0,I specifically purchased this beanie hat expecting to receive it as described and visually represented.  The hat I received is not of the design represented in the product description.
1.0,"After one machine wash the inside liner fell apart. The zipper is on the wrong side. Don't waste your money, look else where."
1.0,"Ordered, tried on, immediately returned. Bad quality item- poor materials and terrible stitching. Do not recommend."
1.0,"These wouldn't lift and stay stuck, no matter what I did. Useless to me. I'm a heavy C cup."
1.0,The shorts came with no drawstring so you can’t keep them on or wear them very disappointed with this product
1.0,"The crotch of these pants is close to the knees, so look and feel stupid.  Not a good purchase."
1.0,"This product was far below satisfactory. The stitching was not clean, and the leather overlapped. My 2 year old could have done a better job. It's hard to believe they are okay with selling such a poorly made product."
1.0,Broke after wearing for a day
1.0,"I bought this watch for travel abroad as it was plastic and thus non-metallic; it had an analog feature (hands showing the time); and a digital feature, which I use to figure the time back home.  The analog hands are easy to reset when traveling, compared to some watches that you need a PhD to figure out how to set it or you have to reset them eighteen hours to get minus six hours.  But the digital time gains about twenty seconds a day, so that after ten days, the hands show one time and the digital window another.  Also, the hands are hard to see most of the time, compared to other analog watches.  I would not choose this watch again."
1.0,"Returned this. Wayyyyy too big, fabric was weird and looks nothing like the photo."
1.0,Received it broken and than lost it in my house so couldn't return it
1.0,Wanted to use it when I teach skiing. Moisture got in and side pin fell out. Didn't last a month.
1.0,"The zipper on the romper looked like it had been used a lot, all the “teeth” or whatever the zipper is called, are all messed up and it won’t zip up, I don’t have time to go and send it back, so I’ll just call it a loss and leave the review to warn others."
1.0,"I bought these shorts to wear in public. They are more like PJ's than outside appropriate. They're too thin and flowy my rear end would show with the slightest wind. They're not flattering at all. I'm 5'6"" 145 lbs and I got grey large. I'm super disappointed."
1.0,This top is not like the photo.  Sleeve print looks different.  Fabric very thin. Returned.
1.0,Sizing not accurate. Large too small. Disappointed.
1.0,"These earrings are beautiful, no doubt! But one of the earring wouldn’t go all the way into my daughter’s ear pierce bc there was a bump on the stem, like it wasn’t smooth, like - it couldn’t even come out the back of her ear. It kept hurting her every time i try to put it on. I didn’t actually see the bump until I tried it on myself. Got me disappointed. ☹️"
1.0,This dress is NOTHING like the photos. The material is different and there are bra inserts that look awful. It looks like a terribly made costume. Not at all the elegant dress it claims to be.
1.0,I returned this bag because the color did not match the shoes I already had.
1.0,Way smaller than my size. Disappointed
1.0,What should I do ？<br />my watch is not working now！
1.0,Arrived broken and not surprised. Cheap and flimsy.
1.0,the online description did not mention that these cannot be put in the dryer.  Very inconvenient and I would not have bought them had I known that.
1.0,Not the size I thought it would be....should be advertise as medium size not large...
1.0,Broke within 5 minutes of wearing. The beads separated from the gold bangle and the wire holding it kept separating the beads apart.
1.0,The over all fit was terrible and the quality of the material is very cheap. Either the model in this picture is wearing a different shirt or it took a lot of staging to quickly get this photo.<br />The open neck was huge and the sequin insert was not fitted at all
1.0,To small and short
1.0,Cheap and tinier than appears
1.0,The band was too small for my wrist.  The refund process was very quick and smooth.
1.0,Awful product representation
1.0,I thought these would give  some sort of support and it’s more like wearing pantyhose completely see-through and it does not  help look slim down
1.0,"These gaiters are finished at the top and bottom, however, there is absolutely no elastic or grip to hold them in place.  They will slid down your nose within minutes of putting it on."
1.0,"I would have loved this purse had the brand logo not been cheaply embossed on the front purse flap. This isn’t shown in the product pictures (and I wouldn’t have purchased if it was). Cute purse otherwise, but returning with disappointment."
1.0,"The post states that it may run small. What it doesn’t say is that the fit is nothing like the photo. The top is shorter than it appears and the sleeves are much longer. The lace is cheap and scratchy.<br />The only reason I’m not returning this item is because I would have to pay for shipping and the cost will be 1/3 of the cost of the top. I will try to tailor it so it fits better and if not, donate it to the thrift store. I am very disappointed in this top and do not recommend purchasing it"
1.0,Ordered these sweatshirts because they state that they are 100% cotton. The sweatshirts that arrived are 44% cotton and 56% polyester. I purchased them for tie dye that's why I wanted 100% cotton so this is extremely disappointing. Also it isn't white as pictured it's more of a cream color. I'll never order from this company again. Buyer beware.
1.0,To be completely accurate on how the sizing on this is it should be in youth sizes. Think tween sizing. Not to mention it's more like the material used on a rug. If I could leave no or negative stars I would.
1.0,"Very thin, poor quality, too small, not as described, returning"
1.0,Can't see through the eyes as they don't line up. Cheaply made and falls apart.
1.0,The chest area is very low cut and you would pretty much have to wear something underneath in order to keep the ladies from showing.  It is tight in the shoulders but loose everywhere else.
1.0,Sent wrong size.  Not worth returning.  Maybe I will lose weight
1.0,giving it to my Asian gf she can fit this....god
1.0,"i got this thing and finally got around to wearing it, it pulled my tooth out when removing after shaping the wax! i want a reply from the seller!"
1.0,"Was very disappointed in this product, the silver I guess came off some of the numbers and dashes and is now floating around on the inside. The major upset is the dam thing have not work for one minute"
1.0,These were perfect until 2 months after I bought them they tore at the top. Looked like someone took a knife to them. I notice after falling on my face . I'm a 73 year old and I figured next time I would break something
1.0,Cheap quality don’t look nothing like the picture worst dress ever
1.0,I'd probably like it if it ever arrives.
1.0,"Very disappointed.<br />I've bought several Coolibar scarves in the past.  But am now so gun-shy that I probably won't again.<br /><br />This thing stank when I opened it.<br />A couple of hours later I walked back into the room where I'd opened it and thought I smelled spilled cleaning fluid.<br />But no, it was this scarf.<br /><br />I've now washed it 4 times and left it in the sun for several days, and the stink has diminished from smelling like naphtha to smelling like a rag that had once wrapped a bottle of dollar-store perfume.<br /><br />I think a few more days in the sun will get it to the point where I can actually consider wearing it.<br /><br />Other than that, the material feels nice and the color is nice.<br /><br />This was on sale and inexpensive enough that I decided not to return it.  But I'll really think twice before buying another Coolibar item :-("
1.0,Literally broke within 2 days of wearing it. Cheaply made. Not happy.
1.0,I really liked it but the strap broke only a few weeks into using it :(
1.0,Had band on for 3 whole days before almost losing my watch over a cheap a#% band. Should have been smarter about this purchase. Won’t happen again.
1.0,Do not buy! These don’t work. At all.
1.0,"It looks like a perfectly good watch; however, it arrived broken. It does not work. I will be returning it immediately and purchasing a different LSAT watch."
1.0,Expected both pairs to be mirrored but neither were. Returned
1.0,I am 5'4 and 123 pounds. The Freya Fearne in 28H is my size. The straps are painful to wear! I could not wear this for more than 12 minutes. But in this bra my boobs bounced all over the place if I just lifted my knee. The take home message is there is zero support! My Holy Grail everyday bra and weight lifting day sports bra is my Brooks Moving Comfort Embody sports bra in 32 G. I hate how uncomfortable Curvy Kate bras and Panache bra straps are and how little support there is in the Panache bras. I returned this. This would be fine for D cup or less.
1.0,"I ended up returning this item, the material was heavy (and hot),  and felt almost like scrubs. Not the trendy/stylish look I was hoping for."
1.0,Poor detailing
1.0,"don't buy and waste your money, its very very small and poor made"
1.0,"Several of the items were already broken when I opened the box. One of crowns/tiaras already had a large crack in it, and after about 30 minutes of use, the “gem” portion on each had already broken off, leaving cheap metal headbands to wear. The jewelry fell apart after the first try-on. This was such a cute set, and I had high hopes for it; but it just doesn’t stay together. It’s very very cheaply made. I do not recommend this product!"
1.0,Reviews Said they fit large. Not true for me. To small and to thin. Can’t wear without tshirt. Returning them.
1.0,The material was flimsy and cheap looking  I hated it!
1.0,That is how it looks after second wear .<br />Stay away from it .
1.0,"I have purchased countless burts bee's pj's for my toddler, but the easter egg print is WAY OFF in sizing. The shirt fit as expected (I always size up since they seem to run small), but the pant waist was huge! I made the mistake of thinking it would shrink enough in the wash and it definitely did not. Happy to rate all the other pjs I've ordered from them 5 stars, but something went wrong with the easter egg print."
1.0,Didn't like anything about this items so much that i didnt even bother to retun it!!! it's very thin!!!
1.0,This dress is nothing like what is shown in the picture.. cheaply made and the inseam was sown inside out just all around cheap looking dress
1.0,Flimsy  $ store quality
1.0,Difficult to read...smaller than what I expected...no shine or sparkle.  Kudos to the company for quick easy and fast return.
1.0,It is see through.  No where in description diens it say the material is sheer.
1.0,"I was going to leave 3 or 4 stars on this,  until I got here and remembered the picture shows this top as being long sieves.  Being lied to makes me angry,  so this top gets one star.  The top I ordered and the top I received are two very different things. That being said, I do like the top I received,  so I'm not that upset about it. I ordered this shirt in black. Rather than being long sleeves like in the picture,  it's actually 3/4 length sleeves--they fall between my elbow and wrist. The fabric is also thinner than in the picture--it's pretty see-through (but fine with a cami). I'm 5'7 and usually between a U.S. M and L. I ordered a L because I wanted to make sure it was long enough to wear with leggings.  It is long enough,  but it's a lot tighter than the picture led me to believe. If you're between sizes like me,  it are looking for a looser top like in the picture,  I'd definitely recommend ordering a size up.  Overall I do like the shirt--the fabric is soft,  it's the length I hoped for,  etc. I just hate false advertising."
1.0,"Too short in the arms for me. Donated it, hopefully it made someone happy!"
1.0,Price to high suit to small smmfh
1.0,i didn't even put them on and i was able to see through them  by far the worst product i have ever purchased
1.0,The shipping took forever. You don’t get it prime so just think about that before you order. I bought it for my 6 month old and he wouldn’t have even been able to wear it for pictures if we did receive it on time because it was way too big. The tag reminds me of a shein tag so I hope it didn’t come
1.0,These lenses are terrible. A foggy mess even after cleaning. Better off to buy one pair somewhere else on Amazon.
1.0,Received incomplete costume (no gloves or mask) in a previously opened package that appeared to be used
1.0,"The pearls look cheap - and is almost three inches shorter than advertized . It costs more to return than it's worth - so I will donate it.<br />Lois price , FB,FL"
1.0,Very cheaply made and poor choice of material.  The belt loop broke off immediately and the plastic closure (made of plastic as well) cracked upon the first use.<br />Would never buy this item again and do not recommend the product.
1.0,Didn't realize it was a stuffed fabric like bangle with a Keychain attached. I just took the Keychain off and left it at that.
1.0,"Bought this for my teenager for Christmas, it’s New Year’s Eve and already broken."
1.0,"I gave it one star because the design is gorgeous. I got the gray and it’s gray unlike what other say about being lavender. However, I also ordered 3 sizes up from my normal size of a xl to a 4x and can barely get it over my chest after reading reviews. I have had it with the China sizing. A 4x should fit 3 of me and I can’t even get it on. I normally wear a Xl in tops and 14/16 in pants. 38 D chest why is a 4 x so small???"
1.0,Cheap fabric that did not layer properly
1.0,"Composite toe fell apart, the fabric tore, the main fabric is mesh so they are not water resistant at all."
1.0,i thought it was gonna be cute to put in my resin molds but i didnt like any of the charms that came inside.
1.0,"Do not buy this product.  Very cheaply made.  Edges are all uneven.  They look to be the left overs of material.  I am returning the product, however, they are making me pay shipping costs.  It's almost like a scam to me.  Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Would never buy again and would not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,"They fit great when I tried them on when they arrived but after the first wash, they shrunk so much that I gave them to my 10 year old son."
1.0,"The smell was so strong of the plastic, I could hardly breath"
1.0,"Very cute! The particular pair I received had glue bubbles on the heart at top of the lenses, scratches and smears in the coating of the lenses.. Very poorly put together. Returned.<br /><br />Also ordered the silver, which arrived in perfect condition! :-)"
1.0,"The masks designs are cute and they appear to have enough fabric to keep your mouth safely covered from Covid, but I wouldn’t recommend.<br /><br />The filter pocket is nice, but that’s really it. The nose piece feels extremely cheap and the fabric to cover your chin is not secure at all.<br /><br />Lastly, the masks all have a very odd smell. Since they literally sit on top of your nose, there is no way to get over the odor."
1.0,I wore the watch one time it broke and now sits in my jewelry box.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this dress. It is an incredibly uncomfortable material, almost scratchy, and see through. It is certainly not worth the cost. Do not purchase."
1.0,Liquid will go inside no matter what
1.0,The  worst pair of socks I ever bought. Just don’t want the hassle of returning them. Like a worn out sweater. Stitching was all over the place. Will NEVER  buy again.
1.0,It’s dirty but it’s brand new<br />And it is more like extra small
1.0,This is definitely and irregular item
1.0,Suspenders were broken after 1 day's use. The clip on the back fell completely apart on first use.  I am returning them
1.0,Very cheesy looking and feather bent
1.0,😼
1.0,These were so small you couldn't see the detail.
1.0,Hat says for adult but barely even goes on my child's head.
1.0,Sunglasses arrived damaged. Right side lens is bent and does not fit grooves. Paint chipped on frame. I am returning item.
1.0,Too small not what I expected. It was too short
1.0,"The band took forever to arrive and when it did, it wasn’t the same band as advertised. Like many have syayed"
1.0,Sags and snags
1.0,"The very first use my luggage was dented, scratched and came around on the carousal open, my clothes were spilling out. I was extremely disappointed .  Returned the luggage."
1.0,These shorts after like five times wearing them have already lost most of the buttons and have holes in the bottom of the pockets. I would never buy these again even at the price they aren’t worth it. The quality is pretty close to trash. You can get a better product at Walmart for a cheaper price.
1.0,"wore a pair, the first time the back came off."
1.0,Super thin fabric. It’s not flannel. The colors in the picture are vibrant and clear. Actual fabric is more red and blue. See photo above. I’m cited for ordering from China.
1.0,So much shorter than shown on mpdel
1.0,Cheap material and its basically pink in color.
1.0,Waste of money and my time. I received my product in a shipping bag all balled up. I was not pleased wit this at all. The product didn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,"Bag was not the same as the picture. The picture shows a PVC leather and mine came pebbled and the zipper pull was different. Returning. Not to mention the bag was just stuck in the box with nothing wrapped around it to protect it, so the purse was in a oversized boxed just tossing around without any protection. Super disappointed!"
1.0,The lacrosse is an oval sticker. The paracord came unraveled after wearing once.
1.0,Size are not great
1.0,It was a small and not a large. 😠
1.0,"This item never fit right, has no feel of compression or any stretchiness or give. Its just a plastic poorly fitting undershirt"
1.0,Got a mask that's from an anime and not NBC. The Jack mask is off-center and the nose strip is sewn into the bottom.  It fits ok with the nose strip on the bottom but there's no way it looks okay off-center. Ugh.  So disappointing.
1.0,Broken inside very poorly designed
1.0,"A piece of junk. Product came with almost all of the rhinestones fallen out of the necklace and at the bottom of the bag. Went to return it, and since its from China, its MORE expensive to return. I had to just throw it in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I bought this thinking it would be exactly the same as what I bought at the store. It's not. I got the black one. Like previous reviews, it was see through. The material was not soft & thick as the one from the store. Wondering if Amazon is getting a cheaper version or the company started making it cheaper. Totally disappointed."
1.0,I ordered a small the item was too large and I was only sent the shirt not the whole outfit as advertised and the color was way different then what I picked out and paid for i definitely give this a zero stars if I could
1.0,"They deleted my previous review, so I'll try again. This dress is a mess. It was 2 feet, yes feet long. It was huge in the bust, didn't fit under the arms, and was basically a green bundle of fabric. I didn't waste the money to send it back."
1.0,It fit just right...but broke at clasp first use
1.0,Dress was not at all as featured. The top was saggy and the waist was unevenly bunched together. Would not recommend this dress. Sad....it is a cute dress.
1.0,These are not kid sized masks. These are adult masks. I will not buy again.
1.0,"These sandals are very comfortable.  However, they did shrink and warp on a hot day at the beach.  Now they are no longer wearable."
1.0,Well first of all the shoes took FOREVER to get to me. Bought these as a gift for my son for Christmas.. (I just got them yesterday) 2nd.. I ordered a 8 TODDLER and got what looks like a 13 or 1 youth!! In other words the dont fit my 1 yr old and they are too big for my 4 yr old!! I'm very disappointed and I'm not going thru the trouble of sending them back th CHINA so I guess I'll be either giving them away or throwing them away..smh
1.0,Turned a bronze color and didn't last very long before it broke
1.0,Have had taxi wallets in the past and liked them.  The new one was smaller than my old one and a credit card would fit with the wallet closed.  Had to return new wallet.
1.0,"These are literally the worst purchase I've made on amazon. They are extremely oversized and look nothing like the picture.  The ""paperbag"" waist is a regular elastic waistband with a piece of material to pass as a ""belt"". These don't even look fashionable enough for my 60+ mother... maybe my 94 yr old nana would like them... for no other reason than comfort. Definitely returning this abomination."
1.0,The material is as thin as it can be to maintain it's shape...any less and it would flop over on itself. The worst part is that the lenses are way too big. This prevents the nose piece of your regular glasses ineffective. It'll rest on the paper thin lenses and cut into your nose. If you are in an accident I hope you don't mind losing your nose. This is maybe worth $0.99 or less. Don't waste your money paying Amazon prices for Dollar Tree quality.
1.0,"Bought these because of the cute design for a 4 year old, but the fabric is so thick it doesn't really breathe.  Almost feels like plastic"
1.0,"It is 41 inches, not 51.2 like it states in the description."
1.0,Very cheaply made doesn't fit right
1.0,"The bells fell off after just one use!  It was purchased to wear as part of a costume for my daughter's play, and not only did several bells fall off, but the clasp broke in the middle of the performance and they had to work backstage to find some way just to keep it on!  Such a horrible product!"
1.0,Weird asf. Lights up randomly and not in any cool or cute pattern when there's any noise detected.  Not very bright or obvious lights either.  Waste of money.
1.0,"The sparkles on this band make it extremely painful to wear. I wanted to return it in exchange for a plain band, but they want to charge $6 to return it. I'd rather throw it in the trash."
1.0,This was supposed to be a different style. I waited over a month for trash! Should have known better!!
1.0,"Product is NOT worth the price; the actual pendant is also hollow on the inside.<br /><br />As a general note, I'd say BEWARE of anything that takes a long time to deliver; chances are, the seller is shipping a crappy product straight from China. The way I received the package was the same way I receive my Aliexpress packages."
1.0,Didn't fit my frames. Sent back
1.0,Shoe was used one time and they are coming apart
1.0,zipper was crooked
1.0,"Bow is not only 's different material than the suspenders, it's a completely different color. Could only wear one at a time because they don't match."
1.0,"This top is huge, measured myself according to chart then ordered... when I got it I laid it on the bed & it looked like a 4x. You expect some extra for the flare  of the style but it measured 16&#34; over my size, WOW!"
1.0,No elastic to actually keep these on your feet. Terribly made product; very disappointed.
1.0,Looks very cheap. Wish they would had a box for them.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY! My 5 yr old wore these shoes for half a day the same day they arrived. 1 of the shoes stopped working, yes I tried to charge it but nope, it still didn't work. I will be returning these shoes and I will not buy these again."
1.0,It’s all synthetic and trasparente
1.0,Don't like the fabric or the way it was made.  Will be returning it.
1.0,Stones looked challis and it smelled of mold sent back
1.0,"I have an inflammatory condition in the skin of the soles of my feet.  I soak my feet in cold water each evening before bed to cool down the inflammation before I apply any creams or meds.  I bought this as a travel foot soak bowl, based on reviews.  I used it two times.  The second evening I used it, the seam between the inner blue lining and the outer black lining came apart and the water leaked into the in between area and the side of the bowl no longer stood up and water went all over a beautiful oriental rug in a fancy hotel in Vienna, AUS.  The bowl was trashed there.  It was such a disappointment.  Do not buy this bowl."
1.0,Hat so stiff I’m not wearing. I took off the very nice Pom Pom to use on different hat
1.0,Very thin material. See through.
1.0,Wrong size. Too small
1.0,Visibly fake
1.0,This product says little kid size but I recieved a womans size boot.  I'm hoping I can either return these for a refund or they have little kid sizes to exchange them.
1.0,Size was for a child
1.0,"Difficult returns does not sound like you will actually get a refund and be charged for the return. The size chart is very off It says XXL size 12 (closer to 6 or 8), NOT SHERPA lined, it's just regular fleece!!!"
1.0,Showed up ripped.
1.0,They were very easy to install.  The quality did not match the quality of the original lenses from Oakley. When you looked at the ground the lenses made it feel like the ground was warped and wavy.
1.0,"Gosh  I loved this dress on the pictures but,that's not the dress that came"
1.0,"Great watch at the beginning as the months progress and I kept wearing it, the background light never glowed in the dark like they said it would. Date never changed over and the knob to change the date and time finally fell off. It was good while it lasted. I wouldn’t recommend it"
1.0,i ordered ithe silver and the gold the silver is beautiful the gold is  really briight gold looks very cheap like from a bubble gum machine . But silver one is really pretty
1.0,No me gusto llego dañado nunca trabajo la batería 🔋 no sirvió ono ce pero no me sirvio
1.0,Did not fit way to tight and I'm not a big guy.
1.0,It's like a toy. Feels like plastic and the indiglo light isn't very bright. Very disappointed because the pics are very nice and the style is great. Returned it the day after I got it.  No biggie! It was inexpensive.
1.0,"These glasses are super stylish but I wasn’t a fan of the three levels of magnification with such small lenses. Due to the cat eye shape of the lens, the lenses are smaller than your typical eyeglass lens. I felt like there wasn’t sufficient separation between the three levels of magnification. I had to tilt my head to really see out of the far away part of the glass. This style of glasses may be better suited to a bifocal than a transitional lens. The bridge felt a little narrow to me and pinched my nose as well, giving me headaches. Unfortunately I had to return them."
1.0,These were supposed to be cotton. They are not!! They are 100% polyester or nylon. Worthless!!
1.0,Way to small and very see through.
1.0,Not as durable as portrayed. The metal cover pops off. This is with minimal use too. I hardly used this as it sits in my console of my car.
1.0,"When I received it, it was broken and no return options"
1.0,"The description states that there would be a sunflower bow.  There wasn’t one included.  There were two pieces of material though.  So disappointing, as the photo looks to show one of those cute head bows everyone puts on their little girls.  It also looks much cuter in the photo than in person."
1.0,Shirt is not worth $1
1.0,"Item arrived broken and not usable, would not repurchase."
1.0,Dress was not the same color as pictured and fabric is cheap and not flattering returning asap 📦👉🏽📭
1.0,Cant get these to go on my watch
1.0,Horrible material and very cheaply made... Very disappointed in it. I have seen this bathing suit on bathing suit websites for 90.00. Should have spent that instead of getting a knock off. You get what you pay for
1.0,These do not let your skin breathe. So they create a bad dry skin & peeling of the skin.(see photo) This is a good pic of the skin not the dry skin that it created. I haven’t worn the watch in weeks & this is still the affect. So you know how bad it was weeks  ago.
1.0,"This jacket's battery charged, but then would not power the jacket. No response at all. The instructions say--if this does not work, return the product."
1.0,Paid for same day shipping and it arrived 2 days later. Not worth the money. For something that is label as heavy duty this item came broken and when I tried to put it back together thinking it was something I could fix easily I got a huge cut on my hand with the retractable metal. If there was an option to rated it 0 stars I would.
1.0,It's not the same as the picture.
1.0,the magnets weren't strong enough to stay on. i tried multiple times and never got it to work
1.0,very poor quality and bright bright yellow have to pay return postag
1.0,"The swimsuit pictured had and X in the front connecting the left and right breast coverage. Unfortunately, someone forgot to put the X on the one that was sent to me. Without the X it lacks stability and proper fit. Very disappointed because I did like the style ordered."
1.0,Fabric is silk & the image wasn't as expected.
1.0,"If you're 5'8 or taller, these will fit like capris. The length was horrible nor were they high rise"
1.0,Don't waste your money.  My purse was delivered beginning of March and the zips are broken.  Have to put in trash.
1.0,"The scarf colors are very pretty. But I was surprised immediately at the material. It looks like cheese cloth and there are already areas coming apart. Very disappointed. Yes, the price was good, the scarf is lightweight and long. My intentions,however, are to return it."
1.0,I didn’t expect much but the pieces were not high quality.
1.0,"Read reviews and size information. Ordered accordingly.  Size too small, material very thin."
1.0,Broke and crystals missing
1.0,Received my package and all the shirts were wet in a plastic bag which cause the white shirt to turn red.
1.0,Popped after one Wear.  What did I expect. It's 2 dollars
1.0,"Way too small, see through, low quality. Just a bad purchase. Getting my money back."
1.0,Order for Halloween got them 3 weeks later! Then the mask didn't even look that great!
1.0,"you think you're getting a nice swim suit but the fabric is horrible. not at all what i expected, but i guess for the price, what did i expect."
1.0,Way to small it looked like a kid size very unhappy with product
1.0,Turned green after a month. I will not be buying again.
1.0,After one wash the NY on the front faded so much that people asked about it and the stitching of the NY pulling away. I will post pictures to show. Very disappointed if I paid 20 bucks ok but it was upwards of 65.<br /><br />Not worth it order from the MLB site and get a custom order instead.
1.0,"My package was soaking wet. Luckily when I opened it it was in a plastic bag. Imagine my surprise when opened the bag, the shirt reeked if B.O and then I noticed the collar... it’s stained with what looks like sweat..."
1.0,Too disappointed
1.0,"yuck, like wearing a wet suit"
1.0,"The color is NOT as pictured!  I ordered the mint ones and the color is like a dusty, faded mint.  Almost like a mint that has yellowed.  It's super ugly but don't feel like returning.  I would not recommend these, as they are so not what is pictured."
1.0,Looks great but one of the bands (the bottom one) doesn't quite fit right and wiggles. I can't use the larger sizes one because then it is too big for my wrist. I checked to make sure it is installed properly and it is. My other bands don't do this. Makes me nervous that it may fall of so I most likely won't end up using this product.
1.0,"Way too tight, felt like my nose was being flattened."
1.0,"I bought this for my wife. The screw backing is so small, it's impossible to get a grip and screw it in. After an hour of trying to screw it in, she gave up."
1.0,"First box snapped the tab trying to set it up. Second (and subsequent third) ripped the side of the keychain box putting the case tab into the closed position. Normally that tab is not an issue because it goes on the outside of the box, but that’s impossible with the wall hook tag Funko puts on the keychain box.  If you want to keep pristine boxes, you’d have better luck keeping them out of these cases."
1.0,too thin. did not deter oils and such from arm
1.0,Too small need to return..<br />Thanks
1.0,Fix the description  to match the picture! I ordered the blue lenses according to the description and I got the red lenses! Dumb now I have to go through the trouble to get the ones I ordered! Not happy!
1.0,Made blisters on my granddaughters foot
1.0,Your vision is distorted wearing these. It's freakin weird.
1.0,I am very disappointed with this product. First of all it has a dirty dark gold color nothing shiny like in the picture and its big n long like something to go around a cows next. I'm very upset due to the fact that I paid so much for it and I didn't get what I saw advertised. Very dissatisfied customer
1.0,"Returning, threads hanging, too clingy."
1.0,"Junk, used it for a day, the zipper ripped off the bag. Don't go by the picture your, it's small your lucky to fit a ring ding in it."
1.0,This set was cute however the hem on the shorts was sewn extremely crooked.  Had it not been crooked I would e kept this set because it looked cute and fit perfectly.
1.0,"These pair werent as pretty as the pic. I thought they were too big, the fit wasn't right for me."
1.0,"I keep getting an XXL. How can I order a large and get a large.  It seems when if I start new, choose large when I get to my cart to verify size it shows XXL again."
1.0,Every other glove has a hole or gets hole when trying to put on hand. It’s separating from the wrist area and the rolled edge. Almost like it’s old.
1.0,The chest and shoulder design of the sweater wasn't ideal once I open the package.
1.0,Glasses have fallen apart as soon as I put them on my face...
1.0,"Product came broken! This dress was clearly worn by someone already as it came broken to me. One strap was tied into a knot to ""fix"" the problem before it came to me. Very unprofessional."
1.0,Nice mask but the adjustable strap didn't stay in place and way over sized
1.0,Ordered this night shirt for my better half it was excited to have it arrived.  Ordered extra large grey and thought it would go down to about her knees.  Opened package it's a white t-shirt looks very small for a child definitely not the extra large adult and gray
1.0,"These glasses have a bridge that makes them stand off the nose about half an inch. Therefore the arms are too short to make it to a  full grown persons ears. These are made for a child, a little person or elf . If your over 5ft. I do not recommend them"
1.0,"It is not fully leather. It may be bonded on the outside, but the outer layer shreds very easily to reveal whatever the inside is made of. Lasted about 45 days before the 'leather' started to peel back."
1.0,got my normal size but it was way to small
1.0,"The material was stiff and scratchy, not soft at all. The sleeves were super long and not ruched like the picture. The cut was very boxy. I couldn't send it back fast enough."
1.0,It broke the first time I used it!
1.0,"I literally wore these for one day and the paint already started to chip. I thought they were colored metal, but they're just paint coated. Very disappointed with these. Do not get them if you want them for your lip."
1.0,The product material must have been rotten.  Never lasted more than and hour.
1.0,The color was cute the material was so shiny not like the picture at all...it already had strings coming apart omg
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap material, runs quite small. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"i bought these to help with my plantar fasciitis.  I put them in my shoes, and pretty much felt like I just strapped 2x4's to my feet.  They are hard as rocks with no padding in the heel where I needed it.  I will be returning them"
1.0,This item did not even come close to product pictured in the add
1.0,Runs big and is a sleeping bra not a posture bra as advertised.  Ordered three and all were wrong.  Don’t order as ot seems to be a bait and switch
1.0,does not fit earring posts
1.0,"These shoes are tiny! I bought a big kids size 4 and they don’t fit my child who is a 3! They are more like a 2. They aren’t well made, the straps don’t go all the way to the other side of the shoe. Avoid the whole returning situation and don’t buy."
1.0,Se encogieron  las mangas
1.0,"This is not made for traditional men, buttons go too low, fits odd, cheap material"
1.0,I thought this sweater was super cute! I got it today and the material is really thin and cheap feeling. The picture is also really faded
1.0,This is made with rayon and no tags at all on the garment to show what material this was made from. Also the added extra material on the bottom to make like a border. Not sure why they would do that. It’s not showing in the picture at all.
1.0,"GARBAGE …. the handle broke on the very first use. She is 9 had two things in there, her cell phone and some slime! REALLY!!!! can I return it?? Don't waste your money!!!!!"
1.0,"I bought the biggest size they offered because I like to wear a shirt underneath my jacket, and for some reason, this was super tight, no room to move. I normally wear a 2XL or 3XL in jackets and this one definitely was not."
1.0,Used the large suitcase one time and the bottom tore and broke the wheel. The inside zippers are also of very poor quality. Avoid this poorly made product.
1.0,The socks are too thick and too hard to get on.
1.0,Way too small. Extremely short
1.0,Very bad quality .. not oxydized quality
1.0,I ordered an x-large for men and it is not.  The size would fit a medium size young boy and a very small man. The products runs small.
1.0,This product came bent from the way it was packaged. The lenses are not at all clear. They look cloudy when you look through them. Totally unacceptable.
1.0,The leather band broke on the first day. It is perfect for my fiancee's style but not worth purchasing again.
1.0,Tore up immediately. Cheap materials
1.0,"Teeny. They MIGHT fit a baby, but good luck getting them on. Disappointing since the seem nice otherwise."
1.0,I did not like the quality of these capri tights at all
1.0,Blair touted as being red rubies but they're really Orange
1.0,"Pros:<br />Looks exactly like the picture.<br />Deep pockets for cash.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Having 6 credit cards and filling up the slots will make the wallet not close.<br />Credit card slot is very tight making it difficult to take a credit card out or placing it back in.<br />Depth of credit card slot is deep (the one in the rear) so if you push your cards too far in, you will have a hard time taking it out because of reason above."
1.0,Looks good on the ad but not in real lifeDoes
1.0,"Incredibly lightweight, and I thought that was uniquely cool.  On day 2 of owning them, I casually removed them from my face, and half of it remained.  I couldn't believe it!  I had to laugh.  ""You get what you pay for."" or ""Buyer Beware!""  Take your pick."
1.0,The padding in them is completely off and small.... and the front comes up way to high... not near the support I was looking for...
1.0,"I am a huge fan off these pants, and have them in several colors/patterns.  For some reason, the eggplant ones slide down my body during exercise.  It is ridiculously inconvenient as I'm spending more time pulling them up than getting into my workout.  They're going straight in the trash."
1.0,I ordered one (free size) and got one that would fit a chunky 7 years old child with a size 28-30&#34; circ chest area.  This is made for an extremely skinny individual with little or no breast - SEE PICTURED MODEL.  The pads were a joke made of cheap hard foam that was molded for the inserts.  Avoid this item unless you are or have a bra size of 30&#34; or below.  I don't think a return is practical at the moment so I will be giving this away to one of my pre-teen nieces.
1.0,not a true size and very short didn't even cover my croch
1.0,Fits like a maternity dress. So not attractive on. I actually laughed when i looked at myself in the mirror. I had high hopes for this but i will be returning.
1.0,This belt is elastic. It is cheaply made and does not hold up jeans
1.0,It's cute but feel apart at the seams after I washed it
1.0,"I am 67 years old, and I can see much better without these glasses that cloud my vision worse than my cataracts."
1.0,"Do not buy this watch! I've only had this for a couple months and something is wrong with the mechanics inside the watch. It randomly stops working even when the knob is clicked in place and you have to push on the knob hard to get it to start working again. This watch is pointless, you have to reset it all the time."
1.0,Waaaay to small. Doesn't even go all the way around and I have no idea who's nose could be this small...Total bummer.
1.0,Not anything like the original trackstets.
1.0,Cheezy compared to others i purchased...
1.0,"Baggy, poor quality, and the back is completely see through. Sending it back"
1.0,I think it's the Worst. nothing like the picture. Please people don't buy. Fabric like what an umbrella is made of. Print washed out looking. Don't buy it's like a top not a dress. Didn't want to put a star. I had to in order to send my review. 🚫🚫🚫🚫
1.0,Didn't look anything like the photo. There's a slip that barely covers your butt and the rest is just cheap looking and see-through.
1.0,"A hole ripped in the bag where the leash hooks onto it the first night that I used it. My son fell down and it just ripped. It is very cut, though."
1.0,Horrible fit and the neckline chokes me. The material  is horrible and not what I expected  at all.
1.0,"I got a different back pack its ok, but is not the one in the picture. I got a blue and orange one. The one advertising on the picture is a black."
1.0,"The neckline looks very tight. Will not order again.  Lavender is a nice color.<br />Need to wash before trying on. Plastic bag was open,  not folded well. Probably a return.  Ordered because it was a couple dollars cheaper and only one in lavender I could find. The first picture on Amazon of the dress looked a little strange,  the rest of the pictures look like stock photos from many sellers. I've ordered several of these tank dresses and found that they are all different, even from same brands/sellers.<br /><br />Will update: very tight around the neckline and arms, seam up the back is uncomfortable 😳"
1.0,Sleeve way too short.
1.0,The quality of this hoodie is very low quality the colors on the sleeve are double green and red and the print is very low quality the colors are all over the place. The eagle instead of being in the meddle is on the pocket and is really low? The sleeves fit too short and the body of the hoodie is too big on be a small. The hoodie feels more like a thin shirt with a hoodie on it. You get what you pay for I guess I do not recommend
1.0,"The loops fall of the glasses, the buckle releases constantly, and the elastic stretches quickly:  TOTAL JUNK!"
1.0,Variety of sizes were too small
1.0,Opened the box and the center stone fell out.<br />Definitely would not recommend or buy again
1.0,"The quality is bad, bad finish, in general i don't like"
1.0,I ordered the couple bracelet and necklace.Everything was nice the bracelets are awesome but the necklace both of them fell apart within 5 minutes
1.0,These earrings are very pretty. The post for the earrings is weak and it broke off of the earring so I can no longer wear the earring.
1.0,Absolute crap.  Run away.
1.0,"El color es feo parece sucio , y me quedó super grande, usualmente uso la l, pero pedi una talla mas, asi que recomiendo pedir su talla"
1.0,This was poorly made - there weren't even any hooks to hold the bottom part of the pants up!
1.0,The XL was too small my daughter that weighs 103 and is 53 and height it didn’t even fit her
1.0,The color is nice but the necklace looks really cheap
1.0,Costume logo peeled apart within an hour of wearing it. I had to use a costume from last year. All in all it looked good but not worth it if there's a chance it falls apart.
1.0,"I'm finally experiencing issues with my night vision, so I had high hopes for these glasses. Unfortunately I found no difference using these glasses. They make things seem brighter at dusk, but there is still some light and that isn't a problem for me. When it's totally dark they make no difference. Would NOT buy again."
1.0,Im sorry but this dress is so ugly in person. Horrible fabric and horribly taylored is wide and goes same width from top tp bottom
1.0,"Two minutes into wearing these shoes my achillies tendons started to bleed. The back of the shoe literally cuts into your skin. I bought a size larger based on reviews warning of this, but it did not help. I had to stuff paper towel into the back of the shoe just to make it though my work shift. They also look cheap, and the buckle on the top rattles. Overall, terrible purchase."
1.0,"These tinted subglasses appear to be manufactured for drivers and sportspeople who cannot see distance well. They did not work for me at all. You may need a pair of prescription distance sunglasses, but at least, they will hopefully aid your distance vision."
1.0,Didn't stay at all no matter what I tried.
1.0,Mine  broke within 1 week of wearing it. For the price I paid I thought it would hold up better!
1.0,Needle point was completely bent. I can't even take the back piece off...
1.0,One of the earrings the stem broke off shortly after I purchased and I could no longer use.
1.0,Had a strange smell. Had to return
1.0,It stopped working within a week of delivery.  First it lost a few minutes and then started again.  It kept doing this for a couple of days before it stopped working altogether.  It was a complete waste of money.
1.0,For the price these gloves are crap. The sems are ripped upon opening. Cant be used
1.0,I didn't like it..the bill was too long for my face and the inside lining peeked out when I would put it on. I tried to make it work but sadly I returned it. The color was more taupe than cream. That was another hit.
1.0,"One of the earrings broke as I was putting it in for the first time. Sent them back for a refund, won't be purchasing a new set."
1.0,"the picture depicts an A line LONG skirt... this skirt doesn't even go to the ankle and is DEFINITELY NOT A-LINE... it's a pencil cut... which is exactly what I didn't want<br /><br />Otherwise its true to the color, but basically useless, as it isn't the style or length that I wanted"
1.0,These earrings are too heavy. They will rip your ear off.  The manufacturer should have a different post for the ear- perhaps an earring back.
1.0,over half of them do not work. Kids still like them but wish they all worked.
1.0,Terrible quality. Save your money.
1.0,Orders one floral print and a black cap. Received two black caps
1.0,"Does not look anything like the picture. Purple on inside and white outline. Description shows purple all around, oh well."
1.0,Material is different from the picture the wings ripped the first time I used it
1.0,"Too small, fabric rough and scratchy!! Sub par fabric, cheaply made! Returned!"
1.0,"This fell apart after the first time I wore it.  It started itching immediately, and of course then I saw the rather obvious problem.  I did love it and it fit well.  It was just made badly apparently.  I'm not sure if it was just mine or what. This is frustrating, because I did really like it otherwise. :/"
1.0,"The product was too small for me, it did seem sturdy but I never used it, am sending it back."
1.0,Broke within 2 weeks super disappointed
1.0,I would give it 5 stars because I love these glasses however they fell apart before they reached my face.  The nice thing is that they are issuing me a refund as soon as they receive my returned glasses in the mail.  If they hold true to their word I will update my feedback.
1.0,Not worth the price.  Looks like a cheap tee shirt with a skirt.  Only can return this item if seller approves it and you have to pay for the return Shipping.
1.0,I don’t recommend these ugly and ugly
1.0,I bought this for my phone and was very disappointed when it broke just a few days after I started using it.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, it looks nothing like the photo. It’s very weird looking. Almost immediately started the return process as soon as I saw it. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,I ordered this dress twice thinking it was super cute. The L and the XL would not zip over my chest. I have a large chest but I should not have had to size up again. Returned both will not be buying again.
1.0,The lettering on the buckle was squashed and smudged as if the mold had been flattened in that area. I called the vendor who checked other buckles in inventory and they were the same so I sent the buckle back. Other than that defect it was a beautiful buckle and I will try to order it again at some later date as it may have been a casting problem with that lot.
1.0,I ordered my normal size (M) and found the outfit to be far too large - it is very very stretchy material and didn't lay right on my torso.
1.0,Looks fake (comes in a sketchy/flimsy box with branding from a sports store) but can’t be certain. Feels itchy.
1.0,Too big for to hold keys correctly and chain unlocks all the time which has caused me to lose my keys more than once. Do not recommend even though good price not worth it!
1.0,"I purchased this dress because I liked the style, but the fabric patterns were just a little to wild for me."
1.0,"It's a great idea, but these protectors did not work anywhere near like I hoped they would.  I was able to put them on the stud earrings, but it was awful trying to put the covered posts in my ears.  I don't give up easily.  But this time I did.  That said, the seller was fine and the transaction went smoothly.  I'd work with them again; I just wouldn't buy this product again."
1.0,"The product was nice. HOWEVER, the shorts were cut. The cut was through through both legs resulting in a return."
1.0,"Flimsy, doesn't adjust as it should. Just nope."
1.0,"As opposed to seams being as pictured, straight down the sides, they are wonky - off kilter and run diagonally into front"
1.0,"Sizes run extremely small, no stretch nor give.  Material is itchy."
1.0,"Was not as pictured. The one pictured looks light weight, what came was not. Also it was on the shorter side"
1.0,This is not as heavy duty as it looks. It thin and it rips easily
1.0,"i took a risk on these and regretted it. This is based on what I have received.<br /><br />1- Packaging came in a bubble mailer in small little plastic bags. Do not expect it in boxes.<br />2- earrings are not polished so they are rough.<br />3- cheap quality as the post are not mounted on straight.<br />4- the back stops are not in the right place for the same pair. One of the set has the back stop all the way in the front of the earring and the other seem the be in the correct spot for the matching pair. (see photo)<br /><br />By the time I noticed this, I could not return them."
1.0,Size is MUCH smaller than advertised...very disappointed 😞
1.0,"Not as pictured. No trim, no sleeve, nothing but a large square scarf."
1.0,"Looks great, works great for the most part, but not reliable. This $50 watch stopped working 8~ months after buying with normal use."
1.0,this dress is sheer material and see through. it also came in super wrinkled. i am making a return and ordering something else.
1.0,I have wore these twice around the house and noticed the side seams are literally coming apart.
1.0,Nice shirt. But the color wore off by my purse strap the first time I wore it. It’s  junk now.
1.0,The clasps are cheap. They've all gotten stuck Around my neck because if the cheap claps and I had to break them off (which was not hard at all) the long one you tie is stiff and awkward looking. Very very cheap and fragile.
1.0,"This arrived in a very rough, course fabric which is not what I expect from cotton. The style looks nothing like the picture, and I wouldn’t consider even wearing it. It came quickly and I called in immeaditely  and was issued a refund."
1.0,Shirt is really cute but the model wearing it must be really thin because it looked nothing like that on me.  I would suggest ordering 1 to 2 sizes up.
1.0,Broken piece of Chinese crap!
1.0,"Within 10 minutes my daughter became frantic and screaming that her feet were burning. The lights heated the bottom of her feet so quickly that we were racing to get her out of them, coupled with the fact that they were way more snug that a usual children’s size 1, it was horrible."
1.0,This shirt will not fit anyone built like the indivual it is pictured on.  As a weight lifter I was extremely disappointed.  This shirt will fit my prepubscent son
1.0,Didnt fit at all.
1.0,"In the picture it shows a bow at the waist,  but mine did not have the bow!"
1.0,I bought these because they were a less expensive alternative to Crocs. Not worth the savings. I have three kids in different sizes. One still had Crocs that fit from last year. She has worn them all summer this year too and they are still holding up. My two kids who I bough these for didn't even make it half way through the summer. Not even worth it. I would rather spend the extra and get Crocs that I know will last.
1.0,"As cute as this suit looks in the picture, it has a very weird fit. My measurements are 39-32-36, okay? So get this... the XL was super small in the chest area, the waist was loose, and the hip/bottom was saggy. I dont have a small butt (sculpted white girl booty) but it hung off me. I was really disappointed in this swim suit."
1.0,It doesn't fit so I can really say anything. It says 4x and I usually wear 2xl or 3xl.
1.0,CHEAP! one layer only so really not safe...two halves of mask were not aligned so fabric is going off side
1.0,none were big enough
1.0,This dress was flawed and smelt bad.<br />Return it to vendor for a refund however never received any refund.<br />Don't waste your time and money avoid this vendor like the plague.
1.0,Zippers were stuck/broken upon arrival. Had to return as it was inoperable.
1.0,Very disappointed did not come with the snaps as described
1.0,The lace was cut uneven and didn't cover the sides of the eyes. Looks totally silly.
1.0,Cheap Don't waste your money
1.0,Not wide enough for the intended purpose.
1.0,"Way to small, couldn't wear at all, not worth the money"
1.0,"Nice dress, runs small. Returned."
1.0,The lights do not work...
1.0,The band will not go on my Fitbit. It is missing a key part for it to fit. Very disappointed.
1.0,completely see through. very thin material.
1.0,"It's pink, not red.."
1.0,"It fit nicely, kind of thin material. However, one was and it came out with a HUGE hole."
1.0,Update:  After several months of light use one of the zippers came right off while zipping it closed. Sounds like a similar problem others had.  Stitching was keeping the zipper on and stitching finally came loose so it is a design defect.  Waiting to see if seller responds.<br /><br />These were a good buy at a great price of around $12.  They did come with a strange odor.  I washed one set on gentle in my he machine and aired the other set out for a few days.  Both smell fine now and they held up to the gentle cycle fine.  I’ve used them on 2 trips and zippers are holding up fine.  The matierial is very thin but that could be good if you are going for lightest weight possible.  Zippers can get caught while compression zipping it so just use caution and push material away from zippers.  Love that they open all the way around unlike my other compression cubes.  Overall I would buy these again for the price.
1.0,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! not as pictured. Not high rise, not as long as pictured. Fabric is barely elastic - feels like polyester. Cheaply made. You have to pay to return!!!"
1.0,"This necklace is going back. My daughter wore it once! It broke as she was trying to put it on to wear it for the 2nd time. It broke in not one spot but TWO! It's a non-metal chain that has a metal end piece on each end of the necklace. The end pieces connect to a little chain that connects to a clasp and the connection point for the clasp. One of the little chain links BROKE and one of the links that connects the end piece to the connection point for the clasp BROKE.<br />To add to the frustration and disappointment of this thing breaking, dropping it off at Kohl's is NOT an option. Yes, I guess I am spoiled by the super convenience of being able to drop a return item off at Kohl's without it having to be in any kind of packaging and Kohl's takes care of all of that. I've had two items lately where I've had to the return item to a UPS Store, packaged up with their printed label on it. I was told this is because only certain items are eligible to be returned via Kohl's."
1.0,I did not like the bellbottom legs. The picture is totally different from what I received.  Sending them back
1.0,"Loved them, but the 3rd time wearing them the bottom of the shoe came unattached. It’s only been a month since I bought them and I can’t return them now. Ugh I really liked them too."
1.0,"I love this watch so much BUT I have returned it three times because it stopped working.  It's really so disappointing because it has such a clean,  classic aesthetic but it just doesn't work long."
1.0,Ripped on the first trip. The support need more padding for the back. The total weight was less than 30
1.0,Very VERY small. I ordered the medium and I'm a small woman with large breast. Then tried to order the large and it was almost the exact same size as the medium.. I couldn't tell a difference. If you have boobs don't buy this....unless of course you WANT everything to fall out up here.
1.0,"I purchased a 5x knowing that it ran small but it’s more of a 2x or smaller, didn’t feel very well put together either."
1.0,I bought two of these for my Funneh obsessed kids for this year's Santa gift.  I am so glad I bought this early and was able to check it out first.  It is absolute garbage.  The shirt itself and size was fine but the image is complete trash.  It is extremely fuzzy and looks like the colors bled before being pressed onto the shirt.  I immediately went to process a return after seeing these shirts.
1.0,"Leather does not match web image. Leather seems ultra thin, extremely shiny and poor quality. Terrible chemical odor."
1.0,Only because I haven't received the whole set I just received the necklace it's a gift
1.0,"the earrings were very cute but unfortunately, they were too heavy and stretched my earlobe"
1.0,"I ordered an XL because I wanted this to be loose and relaxed, like it is in the picture. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. I am 5'7&#34; have a 34B chest and 28&#34; waist, and this was like swimsuit tight. My chest was bursting out of the buttons. If I didn't know any better I would think they simply put the &#34;XL&#34; label on an &#34;XS&#34; garment and shipped it. When I first bought it I thought it was prime, I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. That was my mistake. It took weeks to get here, and after I tried it on and it was HORRIBLE, I found out I had to pay to return it. So I can either spend about as much to ship it back as I did on the original item, or just have an incredibly tight shirt I guess I can wear to sleep in. My fiance thinks it's sexy - because it's skin tight - so I guess that's the silver lining... I would say to order a size or two up, but you seriously could only wear this if you weigh 80lbs, in which case I would still recommend getting the XL and it MIGHT fit like it's supposed to! Save yourself the headache and don't waste your  money!"
1.0,"I have owned many sunglasses over the years and I have always been somewhat mystified as to the wide disparity in pricing between the 'name brand' glasses and the lesser-known varieties. These Chinese-made glasses LOOK beautiful and the quality seems good. The nose piece looks a bit flimsy but on the whole the glasses look pretty solid and durable. Another gripe is that they don't wrap very well around your face; there is too big a gap between your cheek and the outer edges of the lenses when you are wearing them. But those are minor quibbles compared to the MAJOR PROBLEM: you need to be aware that you cannot adequately see out of these glasses!! They are ridiculously dark. It's almost comical; the sellers claim they are polarized, but this goes way beyond polarized. I cannot believe that they employed the proper method of polarization in the manufacturing process. No, it seems more like they baked the inside of the lenses with an India ink solution. No doubt the sun will be blocked out, but EVERYTHING ELSE WILL TOO! You could probably wear them at the beach, but then it would be tougher to see the things you want to see, like the water, the sky, the girls, the sand, the refreshment stand, etc.. Or you could wear them in situations where you wanted to look kind of cool, but which did not require the ability to see. I would NEVER wear them to drive; that would actually be dangerous.<br />I bought the green pair also, but I've also requested a refund, even though I've not yet received the glasses, because I assume that the exaggerated dark vision will be present in those as well."
1.0,"The item came quickly, but as I took it out of the package I noticed one of the straps was busted. I tried it on to see if I should exchange it, but it is extremely small (short) and I have a very short torso. Not recommended."
1.0,I am a size 8 so I bought the medium but they slip off my feet. I think I needed the small but I think they sized them incorrectly.
1.0,TOO small! Clasp is hard to close!  The brads on all 4 sides unscrews!  It's NOT a great purse if you need to carry more than 1 lipstick.
1.0,It won't stay closed!<br />Only have 3 keys on it an ot opens in my pocket...today I put a key on the ignition and everything else dropped to the floor.
1.0,Very tight runs small
1.0,Product broke within a hour of my daughter having them on the front literally came open while she was walking
1.0,"When my ordered arrived and I opened the packaging, I found the product package inside was very worn. As I opened the product package, I noticed the tags were not attached to the suit. As I pulled the suit out of the bag, the first thing that caught my eye was the white sections of the suit looked very dingy and worn. On closer inspection, I could see that some of the white area on the suit was yellowing and I found signs in the crotch area that the suit had been worn. This garment definitely looked as if it was used. I assumed it was new. Maybe I missed that the suit used buried in the description but I sent it back with no intention of buying from this product again."
1.0,Longer in front than back
1.0,terrible
1.0,Wrong order
1.0,Not nicely made very cheap
1.0,they where so cheep looking
1.0,"Despite the measurements listed, these do not run true to size. The pants are obscenely over sized at the waist and yet the crotch is barely deep enough to wear so you end up with pants that barely come to your waist with a waist extremely over sized. Once the drawstring is cinched, the pants are still barely on thanks to the extremely shallow crotch length and you look like you're wearing a diaper because of how ballooned out the top part of the pants are. The tops are not true to the measurements they give either. The bust is way too small, I would order up one at least if you can. The sleeves are almost skin tight. It's very disappointing because the outfit is lovely."
1.0,"I have to send back because these pants are way too large on the hips and thighs so it doesn't look stylish at all. Good quality material though, just a bad fit for me."
1.0,I only received 1/2 of the order  4 different earrings<br />Not happy
1.0,"The hat I received had a defect on the back closure.  It had too much material around the buckle that created a bump which pressed uncomfortably on the back of my head.  I returned the hat, I did not want to risk exchanging for another."
1.0,"I was so hopeful about this sweater, but very disappointed. The material was bulky and did not hang well. It was oversized, but not in a good way and the sleeve did not look like the picture either- just wide. Returned it the next day."
1.0,"This shirt is a cheap very thick mens style tee shirt like what you would get from Walmart. It is not flattering to a womans body at all its very boxy and the design is very poorly done, very plasticy. I was very disappointed in this shirt and will be returning it."
1.0,The pin and connector do not hold and fall off! Very cheaply made
1.0,"I wore these glasses for a week,then the arm fell 0ff"
1.0,The mane hair got bent and then soon after broke off. I do wish that it was made better. It is very pretty to look at. Not to be worn.
1.0,Ad said they had 1 left a 1x so I thought it a bit LG but I could always add layers under it.<br />I got it and  it was so small a pre-schoolers would be lucky to fit init.<br />I love the material and design....way to tiny. I'm sending it back  .
1.0,Love the silky feel although the material feels super cheap and cut from scrap.  The top part seems ok but the pants are poorly made and there are loose thread pieces all over it on the inside.  When I first put them on the front felt like I had them on backwards.  I took them off to check but I had them on the correct way.  They are really poorly designed and sewn together.  They are long and loose on me even though the size is on the smaller side for me but when I go to sit in them it feels like the pants are going to burst at the crotch area because of the poor fit.
1.0,My boyfriend tried to put his on and it snapped SO quickly.
1.0,Omg. Way too large
1.0,Very distorted threw out.
1.0,These are paper thin styrofoam pieces that look hideous. This item is worth about one dollar. The seller is very difficult to work with. The return of this item is as difficult as the seller.  I recommend staying away from this seller. Amazon is stepping in to handle the difficult return.
1.0,I got two pair both had one that was not able to snap into the back so they fell out.
1.0,"Not good quality, I don't recommend"
1.0,Can I give a zero star?  Horrible and was way too small! I have have panty hose that were made of better material!
1.0,"Like the title says, these don't fit into the frames correctly. They rattle/move around in the lense frames. Sadly, they fit like they cost...cheap."
1.0,It was huge and looked nothing like picture.
1.0,Wasn't even halfway full of massage cream
1.0,Order Med. Fit GREAT I am a 34. But the legs stretch out fast and my balls kept falling out the leg hole. I trashed them.
1.0,Size chart is incorrect - they’re too large and they look absolutely NOTHING like the picture.
1.0,fabric no bra or stomach control
1.0,Not true to size runs very small
1.0,Broke when I opened the clasp
1.0,I’m normally a size S/M so I order cause of the reviews & so I when with a Large and it doesn’t fit at all and I bought two pairs. So disappointed
1.0,boots way too large . gave them to friend.
1.0,Don’t order it. You can’t return it. Shipping costs more than the item. Don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,Unfortunately I have to return this dress as it is too big! I went by the manufacturer's sizing chart too. :/ Such a shame. Its a very pretty dress.
1.0,Dress is very sheer
1.0,The tank top is fruit of the loom and the Miami Vice print is barely even there. Terrible quality print. I ordered a medium they sent me a large. So disappointed as that Christmas gift will not be given.
1.0,"Wanted to like them since I have metal sensitivity.  However, despite price they were rather cheap looking with blemishes near the posts.  The first time I took this out of the packaging, the large pearl separated from the rest of the earrings almost immediately.  Unfortunately I had to send them back."
1.0,"I thought these would be good, modest swim shorts. But they ride up a lot and my butt would stick out of the bottom a lot. These are definitely not any better than regular bikini bottoms on that front."
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this luggage.  The zipper will break after flying with it a couple times and their warranty doesn’t cover the zipper.
1.0,Will be returning this when I'm back from my beach trip I ordered it for. It's cheaply made and way too small. If you have curves or bust...don't buy it.
1.0,"The batteries lasted one to three days, they don't keep time, they are challenging to set......don't waste your money."
1.0,VERY short! looks like a kid's shirt and I had to return it.  Even a larger size I feel would be too wide and not long enough :(
1.0,"Garbage, does not work"
1.0,Can’t wear this a a pendant cause it won’t lay flat. It keeps flipping around.  So disappointed.
1.0,Opened the package and the first one fell apart in my hand.
1.0,"The flag is upside down.  No matter which way you cut it, it's wrong"
1.0,"Ladies this thing is small. Like toddler size small; looks larger than it really is. Measure your head before ordering, or it is useless! Pretty material, so disappointed."
1.0,I thought it was too big
1.0,"Don't buy, clasp won't stay closed."
1.0,No se veia bien

1.0,This is not silver or turn want a refund
1.0,"The gloves had such a strong, unpleasant odor, even after letting them air-out, that I had to return them.  They were unfit for human use!!!"
1.0,The pants were big and loose and the top was snug. I bought the extra large and have never had this problem in other sets
1.0,After one week of wearing.... it is now coper sculls.
1.0,The jeans fit true to size but I ordered the black pair and the cut is not the same. Please send what you show us here. Also the button to fasten them is very lose. If I wear these I’m pretty sure it will fall off. I’m getting a refund.
1.0,"I'm very unhappy with these bands. Some of the bands fail to securely attach to my FitBit, causing the bands to come loose and my FitBit to fall off my wrist. The bands should ""click"" when they attach and these do not without significant pressure. I should have resisted the temptation to purchase 5 bands for what seemed like a good buy. I'm disappointed in the poor quality. This was a poor purchase for me."
1.0,Do not buy these glasses. They are at least four times thicker than others. I feel dizzy when I put them on. They can’t be good for your eyes or body.
1.0,"I've tried 2 pairs of these gloves and the heating element is not reliable.  One glove would work and the other not.  The glove that did heat up, its only the palm that got somewhat warm.  The other bad thing about these gloves, besides having to be plugged in all the time, is I couldn't type with them as they were just too bulky."
1.0,"These bracelets are really nice, but I had so much difficulty putting them on that I wouldn't waste my time on them.  They are rather stiff and you'll need someone to help put them on.  They are really attractive, but if you can't get them on, why buy them.  I wouldn't recommend them."
1.0,I cannot wear these at all....first try the posts totally bent in half so the quality is no good at all I do want to return though I feel its worth the hassle
1.0,Shirt way to big and pants to small
1.0,Absolute garbage. I can't even donate it to Goodwill.
1.0,I opened these up and they smell like formaldehyde. The inside of my nose and throat hurt now. I'm returning these.
1.0,I was supprised to find this defect in such nice pants. Otherwise their awesome pants I was going to buy more of.
1.0,This is tiny and cheap. Don’t be fooled. Their are better ones. Not unless you are buying for an infant.
1.0,"Got it for my wife, it was supposed to be a 3 xl but it was more like a medium."
1.0,"You get what you pay for! The only metal on the watch is the back of the watch, everything else is cheap and plastic!"
1.0,"One of the lenses was foggy and I couldn't see out of certain spots , spent like a a week trying to contact the seller and nothing , I wouldn't recommend these there are plenty of other glasses like these here."
1.0,"5’6” and 160 lbs, I ordered a large and it was waaaayyyyy too small."
1.0,Runs super small. Go a size up
1.0,"No fue la medida que pedí y lo peor ya no pude devolver,es una lástima mi dinero porque no es lo que esperaba"
1.0,"I usually wear a small in workout tops but based on other reviews I sized down. The extra small was so loose and looked nothing like the photo. Because I’m petite but rocking a 36D, the top just didn’t look right at all. It was loose in all the wrong places and the material seemed pretty cheap. Returning!"
1.0,Title says 2psc but I only got one key chain. Like the key chain but disappointed
1.0,Not as shown in picture. It shows the neck front at above the cleavage. Is exact sz but was made that the neck opening was clear down to below my breast.  Not manufactured correctly
1.0,"I didn't care for this shirt at all and I did not like the material.  The shirt doesn't fit quite right, the cuffs are too loose and the shirt comes down over his hands."
1.0,"Buyer beware. Arrived vacuum packed, had to peel the layers of skirt apart because it was packaged while not completely dry or something.<br /><br />Some parts of the skirt look just like the ad. Other parts lost their (spray?) coating from being stuck together. The areas that lost coating have a permanent wrinkled appearance, the remaining dye is darker where the creases were.<br /><br />Luckily this was one of 5 skirts I ordered to try out as part of a Halloween costume. It had the best fit out of the group but the dye issue made me go with the second best."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c8ccf11b2b1f454d8a943737fe822856]] What can I say .. I am so upset with that I revived .. not only is the jacket a completely different color from what I ordered, it was not properly made. They patched a little piece of faux fur and missed the complete outline of the jacket and it keeps lifting. This was a size 3T. Not true to size. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Upon arrival it was a pretty ring, unfortunately it’s already begun to tarnish."
1.0,Looks pretty but does not require after stretching it out
1.0,They were sized so small and ripped the first time i slept in them. The seam completely split. Bad quality.
1.0,Red color is way off
1.0,I clipped my long buttonless sweater front at the waistline . I thought it looked ridiculous!  The clasp reminded me of old mitt in clips. The clasp didn’t open very wide for a bulky sweater either.
1.0,"Complete piece of garbage. Never worked, tried new batteries twice and I never got it to work.  Absolute waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1.0,Very regular.did not look great with watches
1.0,very very long! does not look like the picture at all
1.0,"Received an off the shoulder hi-lo dress with as very short front instead and had to send it back. Needed by a certain date for a school performance. Very frustrated. Fortunately, there should be enough time for a replacement to arrive. Fingers crossed."
1.0,Not true to size. Very small and very very narrow.
1.0,these might be OK for women but not men. I have size 11 foot and they were way too tight and cut off blood circulation.
1.0,When this arrived the band was very much pink and not at all red
1.0,"Band is pretty stiff until broken in in a short period of time.  I was just disappointed that the band separated from the part that slides into the Apple Watch.  I found my watch on the floor, not knowing it had fallen off.  Would have been a much bigger disappointment if it had fallen off away from home and I'd lost my watch."
1.0,I ain’t even had it that long in it already basically broke can’t find the screw that goes on the side for nothing 😵‍💫 but I love the design in etc ….
1.0,Beautiful but cheap...I know the pricetag was cheap but I honestly thought I would get more than 1 wear out of it before it snapped.
1.0,Susana A
1.0,"This is huge, cheap and ball was crooked.  Someone, in a review, had said it looked like something from a gum ball machine and it totally does.  Not worth 99 cents and definitely not worth $5.99!"
1.0,Turned colors before it reached the home
1.0,Runs big and design is not what’s pictured. And they won’t honor the return policy. Very disappointed and will not buy here again.
1.0,"It took over 2 months for this to arrive. It was to be a Christmas present. It was late.  Its sent from China. I bought an XXL I fits like a medium. Very thin, has numerous fuzzballs, see through material in some spots and it looks like it was either unfinished or bugs ate part of it. Poorly manufactured. Disappointed, inconvenienced. I was given 3 different arrival dates!  Owner contacted me and asked me for a good review. I'm sorry, I am an honest person and won't lie. Asked for refund."
1.0,it was very difficult to get on and off because it didn’t want to flex in a round motion. and it hurt the sides of my wrist because the edges were super sharp! really not comfortable.
1.0,These were supposed to be 20 gage but when they got to me they were 22 gage or even smaller and seemed to be of poor quality wouldn't reccomend these at all
1.0,Extremely light weight pants.  Can be used for walking about but absolutely NOT SWEAT PANTS...
1.0,Very disappointed. I have average size heels and the plugs do not fit on them. They are completely loose and fall right off.
1.0,My grandson is starting a T-shirt collection he loves to wear and show his T-shirt’s
1.0,"At first sight this necklace is beautiful and it was just what I was looking for. However, after about a week of wearing the necklace the coating wore off and it gave me a rash. I will get an allergic reaction to cheap metals in my ears, however I have never gotten a rash from a cheap necklace, until this one! (Attached is what it looks like ok both sides of my neck where the necklace laid.)"
1.0,I bought these sandals for my husband and he said they are so uncomfortable and left him with blisters after wearing them for 5 minutes.
1.0,"I had high hopes for these after reading the reviews that they were a longer bar and fit comfortably however I was very disappointed when I received them. EVERY bar is a different length, and only one of them is long enough to wear comfortably for more than a few hours without pinching my nipples. Although they seem to be a great quality, I will never be able to wear 3 of the 4 pairs."
1.0,If I could give no stars I would!!! I only got front pieces for the silver pair and one of them is rusted. I bought these earrings after reading all the rave reviews on how amazing they looked and the fact they would match a lot of my clothes was an added bonus. Now I’m just livid.
1.0,To flat. Stitches are to loose. Not happy with the closing tab. Not thrill with this 👛
1.0,Waaaayyy too small. 3x size fits about a size 12 at most.
1.0,Bought these from a reputable birkenstock dealer and I had to return then 4 times as the pink bottom came away from the main shoe each time.
1.0,"Appears this hoodie was returned before as the package was open and the charging cord for the battery was missing, however the packaging for the cord was in the box. In addition the on/off switch was not operational, probably why it was returned the first time."
1.0,"Extremely baggy, almost balloon legs."
1.0,"Size was small, gave them to my wife"
1.0,"Flimsy brim, poor fit... spent more for a Rapha happily"
1.0,"Sooo small. I ordered it 2 sizes up because everyone says it's small, and I would like to wear it with a sweater. It is unbelievably small."
1.0,"No me gustaron demasiado pequeños, se quedan entre las uñas"
1.0,Super lightweight and comfortable but quality is crap
1.0,Returned. I ordered an XL which fits like a “juniors” XL which equals an adult S or M.
1.0,Broke after two uses
1.0,"I've had this watch a little over a week, and three of the stones have fallen off and been lost. Very disappointing."
1.0,Purchased for Christmas gift for my sister. Messaged her to see how she liked and had broken before that evening. This was very dissatisfying as this was a gift! I attempted to contact the seller to rectify prior to leaving a review but they have never contacted me back.
1.0,Last year’s date is printed on the shirt
1.0,It’s wasnt even a rainbow n the colors looked faded
1.0,No son nada comodas se baja al caminar cuando te agachas se te enrollan como persianas
1.0,Run large. Fit is strange and the rips are not at all what is shown. Returned!!!
1.0,"RIP OFF. It says that it lights up, but it doesn’t. Just a cheap metal key ring. False advertising and a RIP OFF. One star because I can’t give it zero. And seller, if you want a better review then you need to send me the product that you advertised."
1.0,"This is a great shirt, however it is extremely small. I wear a medium across the board, and ordered a large to be safe. It is skin tight and unflattering."
1.0,My wife says they poke her in the side
1.0,Not silk as advertised! This is 100% polyester. Cute but is not as advertised
1.0,color faded quickly
1.0,Soft scarf but made me itchy when I wore it. It's definitely not 100% cotton. I returned it.
1.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and 112 lb female. It was took tight for me.
1.0,"It was too small...The material it was made of was cheap, maybe that's why the dress was so inexpensive"
1.0,The elastic across the chest makes it look extremely cheap. The neck part is twisted and doesn't fit right. The back zips too high. It's just an oddly-shaped dress. The material is the cheapest of the cheap polyester blend. It feels like a Halloween costume. But I guess you get what you pay for. I just wanted to cover up my left arm tattoo. Problem solved.
1.0,"This slipper are nice quality.  However they are only in mens sizes which are huge on women.,  Had to return.  No exchange."
1.0,Loved this dress but I washed it once and the strap broke
1.0,I know it says push in but even so I expected the product to be secured once pushed in. The turquoise bead falls right out of the rod.
1.0,You can't tell from the picture that you have to have a huge nose to wear these.  The product is a lot different when you see them in person.  I will definitely never purchase sunglasses online ever again.  Especially since I want to return them and this company charged me shipping when I purchased and now they are not covering shipping when I'm trying to return them. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,I did not purchase but would have if it came in larger sizes. My granddaughter is 11 and just became a big sister  I’m not sure why all the big sisters shirts only go up to size 6T
1.0,Got this just now. It was for my husband. The band is short on one side. Stupid! Returning and won’t buy another one.
1.0,This top arrived and it is in a much thicker fabric than expected. Does not drape well and sleeves stick out like more of a tacky ruffle.  I purchased a small and it's too big and boxy.  Will be returning
1.0,Band faded immediately
1.0,When my wallet arrived it had splotches all over it as if someone had spilt something on it or it could have been moldy. I tried to fit my checkbook and check register into the wallet and neither would fit. I'm returning the product for a full refund.
1.0,"Poor quality craftsmanship. The bracelet looked great, but it broke while trying to put it on. I was given a refund afterwards."
1.0,"There’s so many things wrong with these shorts in so many different ways I don’t know where to begin...<br />First, the top of the waistband is tight and cheap so it does that breaking/stretching thing when you try to put them on.<br />Second, I get we want a little high waisted right... these covered my entire torso almost up to my boobs I’m not even joking<br />Third, the scrunch butt is so high up on the shorts it doesn’t even touch your butt.. it’s like on your back.<br />Yes they are soft material but these are NOT alike they are advertised."
1.0,Waterproof Rain Shoes Cover Men Rain Gear Rain...
1.0,They we’re definitely not toddler size and didn’t fit my girls at all. The shipping took over a month and so I didn’t want to waste more of my time trying to return them and having to wait even longer for money back.
1.0,Not the size depicted on the website MUCH smaller.
1.0,I was expecting much MUCH  better quality for the price. The image is nice but the quality is definitely lacking.
1.0,Very poor quality synthetic materials. Screen printing started a loosen after only a few washes.
1.0,These were 2 Small Way too small
1.0,Fell off the next day
1.0,"Poorly made. The three pants each fit differently. Generally baggy in front with no room in the back for your rear end. One pair actually fits better worn backwards! When I walk, the bind in front and the waistband pulls down in the back. I'm 5'11&#34;, 165lb.<br />The fabric is like paper. I washed them once and they're still stiff, not soft cotton."
1.0,The letters we're already starting to come off off before I even put it on.
1.0,"Returned, very thin with a prison kinda look."
1.0,Unfortunately I only received the V portion of the necklace and not the little crystal layering one<br />...
1.0,Better order 3 times bigger and the material sucks feels like burnt polyester
1.0,Broke within days of wearing them. The bond between the charm and the applicator was weak af
1.0,The thong broke when I was trying the shoes on. Returned and refund was quick.
1.0,Dont buy it.
1.0,WAY to small.
1.0,"It is very obvious it is plastic. I thought the rose would look like antique white, giving it the vintage look that it advertised. Instead it is butter yellow & very cheap looking. I got what I paid for, but not what was described."
1.0,"Is not like the picture show, and you can't see thing clearly when you wear it"
1.0,Incredibly poor quality.... fabric very thin and sizing is way off .....
1.0,"too big, and cheap looking"
1.0,My daughter gets so mad because these fall off within minutes
1.0,The dress came sewn incorrectly where the shoulder was all twisted.  Seller provided a small refund but wouldn’t except a return or exchange.  Do not buy from this seller
1.0,"There are lots of criticisms for good reasons. Pretty pattern, but..."
1.0,"I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter. When I received it, it came in a bag, when I took it out of the bag and unrolled the belt, it cracked right there in the middle, we did NOT even use it!, the paint was already falling off of the different sided of the belt. It is NOT leather as advertise, very cheaply made, also bulky and would not fit most of my daughters jeans. Very disappointed! sent it back."
1.0,"Do not waste your money! The quality of the tee itself seems to be decent but the screenprint is abysmal. It's pretty small, fuzzy, and just has no detail. (The first picture is of this shirt, and the second one is a much nicer shirt I purchased locally to compare quality.) I am pretty bummed with this purchase. Lesson learned I guess. When the seller posts obscure photos of a product...it's for a reason! Maybe I'll wear it to pull weeds this summer. Lol! All those 4 and 5 star reviews you can't read...interesting..."
1.0,I returned them right away.  The quality was one star.
1.0,"The quality is okay, but it's too big, and it's easy to slip off when you put it on, it's not firm at all."
1.0,"The material is super cheap! Course material, and even with starch, it would stay unwrinkled."
1.0,"Sold as 54"" long but only measures at 46"" long."
1.0,"I bought it for my sister who deals with non Hodgkins lymphoma, which is what the mask advertised. Instead it said elder abuse awareness. False advertisement."
1.0,I have other tanks from same company and they are pretty good. These are not the same fit and have a bit of a feminine appearance with the side panel stitching being a little scrunched up. Wish they fit like the other Neleus tanks.
1.0,Shrunk 3 sizes when washed. Cant wear anymore
1.0,I needed the case for iPhone 5S and received the wrong case. Please replace.<br />thank you
1.0,This was terrible. The mask didn't even look close to what I paid $33 for. I just received it today and I am immediately returning. Pathetic. I'll buy from another seller.
1.0,The pants ripped on the first day of my daughter wearing them during her sleepover.
1.0,"Corriente, nada elegante por el material."
1.0,"Bought this for bachelorette party for everyone... does not fit anyone of us. Way too big. Literally spins on my head when I move. Doesn't even come close to fitting...... for a man I guess this would work... for a woman, not even close."
1.0,the color was not the color advertised and it did not have the tassel either
1.0,"I did not love this ring.Its not at all like the picture.I am well aware of what costume jewelry looks like,but this was just crappy.I will be sending it right back."
1.0,"Was not very stretchy, kind of scratchy, and didn’t fit well. top and skirt are sewed together, kind of acts like a dress."
1.0,The cover won't stay closed after 3 days.  Just printed the refund mailer.
1.0,"I washed it once, line dried it and it shrunk so much I can't even wear it anymore!"
1.0,"There’s a strong chemical smell when you open a package. It dissipates but I had to air them out for a couple of hours because I didn’t want my hair picking up the smell. The material isn’t netting, it’s stiff and plastic feeling with holes punched in it.<br /><br />The first one I took out was completely defective, the elastic just came off in my hand. The second one looked ok, but after the first night it had a three inch section where the elastic was no longer affixed to the fabric. The third one I just tried to put in and there’s already a section of loose elastic.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn’t recommend these for sleeping in, or for multiple uses."
1.0,Ordered XL which was way too small.  I am 5’10” and the romper did not come close to being long enough for my torso. Not a problem usually but when I went to return it I discovered that the return postage was more than the cost of the item in the first place.
1.0,It took two months to receive.  The sleeves are way too short and ridiculously puffy.  The fabric is cheap. I’m returning this!
1.0,I just opened these and the nose piece is missing the screw. They are basically useless.
1.0,This top isn’t flattering. The fitted material works well but the cleavage is ugly. Makes it look very conservative and not sexy.
1.0,These magnetic earrings won't even work on a 6 yr olds ears. Do not buy.
1.0,"These are MUCH too small, and according to the measurements, they should be roomy. Returning."
1.0,Sizing chart way off these shorts were way way to small.<br />Very disappointing as these were a gift!<br />Want to return and my money back.
1.0,The lights did not work right out of the box.
1.0,Terrible service from the manufacturer
1.0,First thing I notice is that it’s completely see through. Second it wasn’t even close to the color in the picture. The picture was black but it came in a reddish browny color wasn’t cute at all. And lastly the fit is horrible shorts are small but then your drowning in the top. This I could see possibly being different for different body types but there’s no point in wearing it if I have to wear a whole other outfit underneath cause you can see straight through it. I’m very disappointed I was super excited for this and waited nearly two months to receive something I cannot wear.
1.0,"The jumpsuit zipper is misaligned. It runs diagonal rather than down the middle. Plus, it is a non-refundable/replaceable item."
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all
1.0,Returned them
1.0,If I order a dress in size 3x.. Why the titty part is an A cup? If u gonna make the dress plus size with stones covering the breast u should definitely add more stones to cover a plus sized woman's breast smh. Dress fit good. Breast part absolutely tf not. I had to order a few packs of stones to cover my breast so my bra don't show and look tacky
1.0,looked nothing like the picture
1.0,"Not my style, wide legs, stiff fabric, hip hop like they are advertised"
1.0,"Well i ordered a LARGE BLACK striped jumpsuit and wonderful amazon sent me a EXTRA LARGE GRAY jumpsuit..so thats how that started for me. So anyway i decide to give it a shot and try it on anyway...i dont even know what to say. The legs are huge, wide and long...im 5'2 and about 145 lbs....the top is small...it balloons at the crotch but also pulls at the same time like its not long enough in the torso and im short ...u can not even try to lift your arms...i  just have no idea what is even happening with this outfit. Bought it for vaca but since i have to leave and got this right on time, cant return it or even use it....so now im stuck with this thing that doesnt even fit and isnt even the right color. And amazon has been really odd with returns lately and have been no help even for having prime."
1.0,"The tag says buring, which is a slang term for prostitute, according to Wiktionary. It should say burning.<br /><br />Other than the typo it is very nice. If it's corrected in the future I will buy another one."
1.0,This was not anything like the picture. Material was way different and thin/shear and there are weird shorts that are lined in that you can see.
1.0,cheep costume jewelry
1.0,Sizing an issue. ordered per reviews and recommendations on sizing and still too small.
1.0,"Well<br />>>To get it through the belt loops of my work pants I had to remove the buckle every time<br />>>Unlike other d-ring/ slide adjust buckles, this one adamantly resists cinching the belt once re-assembled<br />>>on three occasions the buckle released itself as I bent over while performing regular work-a-day actions."
1.0,Came broken and looks like it was used.
1.0,Got this but straps don’t fit easily.<br />Waste of money.
1.0,It was completely apart when I got it...
1.0,"Horrible, run, don't walk away.  About one in 8 worked and then for a very short time.  Got them for my class at Halloween, through most of them out and the kids were all bummed.  Way to ruin a holiday party."
1.0,this was a birthday gift for my daughter in law. i don't know how she would rate it.
1.0,I need a large
1.0,I went a size up and it was still too small actual sizes run lower than the actually are.  My first time ordering clothes was disappointed needed it for a wedding this weekend ended up running out to buy another dress wrong color
1.0,"STATIC GALORE! This just looks dowdy. It's super staticy and clingy around the legs, and the button front is just silly looking. The fabric feels awful too! more like fabric a tent should be made from."
1.0,Turns your finger green so disappointed I would have just offered the cheap adjustable ones:(
1.0,"The fabric of this dress is so cheap, I wouldn’t let my daughters play dress-up in it. It’s poorly made; the wrap fit is off/lopsided (the slit to wrap the belt is right under the sleeve); and it is so sheer you would be stuck wearing a full body suit underneath. If I could give a score less than one, this dress would receive it."
1.0,The masks slide off when wearing this!
1.0,just dont! really just dont! and i got the one with the yellow stripe when i ordered the black Sooo cheap!!!!!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:db4ace245bde8f8118c28fa26d5157da]] I was very upset to see the quality of these items. All squeezed into the tiny box that it was delivered in. If I could give it zero stars I would.
1.0,"The watch looks great, but the edge of the band is like a razor cutting into my skin and one day it runs five minutes fast, the next day it runs five minutes slow."
1.0,Thin metal....big dent when I had it  engraved 👎🏼
1.0,"This costume only came with hat,dress when i got dress it was flat at the bottom not poofy like on the picture the size i got is too small and the hair on the hat was smushed form the package the dress is just plain flat i didnt like this costume (i recomend not getting this costume)"
1.0,"Very thin material, cheap belt, and way to long.  If you do not have hips or a butt, this is not the product for you.  Needless to say, it was NOT the product for me."
1.0,fog up if not moving
1.0,The quality was not what I was  hoping.
1.0,You get what you pay off ... Broke within 2 days
1.0,"The La Raffine black titanium steel hedgehog hoop earrings, made in an undisclosed location, measures about 3/4"" externally and 5/16” internally.  Each earring has 6 spikes and weighs .05 oz/2g which feels heavier than a typical stud.<br /><br />The earring hinges at the base using the post to lock the earring into place.  Opening one earring takes way too much effort, while the other is too loose to keep in my ear.<br /><br />In addition to the poor quality, the current price of this earring set is excessive.  This is one of those items that have one manufacturer sold by many brands.  A quick search on Amazon will reveal several options.  This brand is the most expensive option I have found.  For instance, [[ASIN:B072JYNWR6 this brand]] is currently about 2/3 the price.  [[ASIN:B07CWRRP98 This set]] comprises of four earring pairs including this design, plus [[ASIN:B07CWRL4VR another set]] includes this design in three separate colors, both currently sold at a lower price.<br /><br />The La Raffine black titanium steel hedgehog hoop earrings come in a gift box at a higher price than other identical options.  If you are interested in buying these earrings, shop for the best price.  However, I would not be willing to pay the current price and highly doubt the quality of any brand.<br /><br />► PROS:<br />None<br /><br />► CONS:<br />Inconsistent quality<br />Excessive price"
1.0,The piece of material that gives the rim structure is very hard around the head and hurts. Even if you loosen the fit it is very uncomfortable. I returned the hat and was very disappointed.
1.0,The size I ordered was way off. The bottoms fit but the top is like a kids size. Very disappointed.
1.0,La impresion luce barata
1.0,"The Diamond doesn’t fit, I can’t put the diamond"
1.0,"It's too small- I usually take a small, so I ordered up a size as the vendor suggested...still too small!"
1.0,Very disappointed since I received my bracelet with a broken hatch.
1.0,Not at all as expected.  Sizes run very small.
1.0,I only bought this for the black one with the knife and other tools. It was great for about 2 weeks until it broke. I keep my car keys on it so there is hardly any weight used on these things. The spring or something inside broke so it won’t stay latched.<br /><br />Waste of money.
1.0,No Stars the stone fell out the first day. We can’t find the stone I want an full apology and a full refund !!!junk
1.0,"Each side of the collar is a different color of fBric, one side is white, the other is off white."
1.0,Worst material to have against my skin. Feels like a lawn chair mesh. Way too tight and too small for it's size.
1.0,Yuck! Zipper design not good for stretchy pants/leggings ...zipper is always off center; faux zipper would be a much better design for these; I am thicker waisted & thicker in the middle and do not recommend these for my body type because they r too low waisted.
1.0,They will shrink to half their size.. just pure garbage...
1.0,"Hats run extremely small in fit, not as outlined."
1.0,"I ordered a size larger than normally and it still fit like it was 2 sizes too small. The the placket was crooked, too. Will be returning and trying a different brand."
1.0,These are not midnight navy more of a denim blue also I have a lot of fitflop sandals/boots and I usually wear size 10 but wear 11 because the need for extra room of my wide feet. These fit snug and will send back because that and misrepresented of COLOR.
1.0,Save your $4 and buy a coffee! This was cute for literally one time that I wore it. Second time it fell apart. The straps that tighten the band simply came off. Please just spend $10 and get a cute black watch that will last 100 times longer.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:bc1a3eeece769b0a4711bb2595b9e627]] Everything seems perfect! But I did not received the card that guarantees that is REAL! :/ so I’m worried that it’s not real. And to pay that for something not real… then what guarantees that is real then?
1.0,"They say you get what you pay for, but this wasn't even worth the $9.99!  It's so small that is doesn't even cover the shoulders and the cupped part around the bottom won't even stay folded up to catch anything!  This is worse than a dollar store item!"
1.0,Made me look pregnant
1.0,Bought this with clown costume for sons performance at school.  He tried it all on as soon as delivered and this nose split wide open the first time he tried to put it on his nose!  Now there is no way to make it stay on.  I didn't expect it to be high quality but I did expect it to last more than 15 seconds.
1.0,Not true to size and shrinks when washed!
1.0,Greasy and smelly.  Tossed them in tbe garbage.
1.0,"Thought it was the hard bioflex, but it wasn’t what I wanted"
1.0,I didn't like it because it's big I thought it wouldn't be so big...
1.0,The shoulder straps broke the first time I used it so I had to use the handles for the rest of my trip.  Pretty inconvenient when I'm also lugging around a suitcase and a large tote over cobblestone streets!
1.0,"They are worth nothing, they don’t keep your hands warm they are water proof, but I can say they are by no means live up to what they will do, I bought two pair and I gave them to friends that work in cold conditions, as I do as well. They gave me a thumbs down on them, so I just threw them out and I learned a valuable lesson on this brand!!"
1.0,It felt like I was wearing a plastic bag. It felt super thin and the slit when up way higher than expected.
1.0,Broke first time I wore them:-(
1.0,"This is a very tacky shirt and it doesnt fit well, the small is huge and the middle looks like gross tinfoil that are an ugly greenish yellowy color. The return policy is terrible and not even worth the hassle since they jip you out of your money. I wouldn't buy from this company and will never wear any of the cloths I purchased from them. Very unhappy."
1.0,This underwear was so uncomfortable and itchy. It’s not soft at all.
1.0,Material is too heavy for summer. Missed the return window so hopefully it will be more wearable in the fall.
1.0,Top was nice to ware once!!! The top was used as an under a blazer at the end of the night it had lint from the blazer rubbing I guess !!! Not worth the money!!!
1.0,"I love knitted sweaters at xmas and was excited to find a “knitted” dress. This is thin, t-shirt material with a jersey knit pattern. Not even jersey knit! BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1.0,After a week the color faded. The red rose is now orange.
1.0,"The dress was off the shoulder which is not what is depicted and it did not fit.  While trying to return it, I continually got push back from the seller.  I was told to take it to a tailor or to try and sell it.  I have never had issue returning any thing I have purchased on Amazon and this has been an awful, frustrating experience."
1.0,"Too small no stretch! Too much trouble to return, wast of money"
1.0,"Wrong size, cheap material, not worth what they are selling it for."
1.0,No instructions on how to install this watch band... I'm clueless. They gave me a tool??? Wtf am I supposed to do with it!?
1.0,"This product came missing a gem. It wasn't even in the package, so it was packed this way. Poor quality."
1.0,"Wore twice and the stitching around the waist is unraveling. The fabric has a good feel but I have to say I am disappointed. The first time worn, the stitching at the top waist area was unraveling. I do not see this item having the quality expected. I was expecting better quality because I have cheaper and they are so much better."
1.0,Item was defective. Never counted one step.
1.0,I ordered XL. I am 6ft 220lbs and xl is usually fine. This shirt runs really small. I have it to my son who is smaller.
1.0,This is too thin to use as an effective mask during theses times
1.0,I ordered 3 different colors. Same size and everything but non of them were the same in size when I wear them.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fb9d49851a94bbf365d4865e5cd2248]] I was expecting a plain ring. Like what it looked like in the picture.
1.0,Some of the stones were missing.
1.0,Nice hat once I took it out the small package about the size on my hand. Not expecting this at all. Wasn't planning on de-wrinkling a hat.
1.0,It fit well in length and arm length and width everywhere but the chest area but it was made for small chested ladies definitely so tight and squished my boobies in. But if I would have ordered a size bigger it would have been big in all the other places. Btw I wear a size M usually and 32 D bra. I'm 5&#34;7' and 160 lbs. If that helps.
1.0,Material cheap<br />Zipper broke
1.0,I was very disappointed. These were plastic and not acrylic. (I know the difference via the bend ability and outer texture and I’ve worked with acrylic keychains for years )<br />They were all scratched up there was not even a protective paper on them. They were all shoved in a bag and there was not a single good piece that was usable. It also had a filmy look to it.<br /><br />Attached photos. The clear pretty one is from another vender and is acrylic.
1.0,I wear a size 8/Medium. This must have been for someone really small because the medium would not have fit a 3rd grader. Really disappointed because the reviews read sized well.
1.0,"Cheap, gold not champagne."
1.0,Shipped FLAT!!! So disappointed because not what was pictured. Plus label say headband & that's not true. Headband is included and you have to attach yourself
1.0,I was certain I ordered a womens extra extra large. When it came it was a juniors extra extra small.
1.0,Do not recommend. I’ve had similar belly rings to these before and loved them. These two both broke within 2 weeks together. First one the top ball unscrewed itself like it was stripped out. Second one the top ball cracked in half.
1.0,Literally Infant Sized Glasses
1.0,"Face masks are super thin and small, I don't recommend wearing them where there are large crowds since it does not cover your entire nose and mouth"
1.0,Sent back.  Looked like a Moo Moo
1.0,"I love these earrings but they broke after one wear, both pairs! Bummed"
1.0,The charms. Were ugly
1.0,It’s absolutely disgusting!!!
1.0,"Zoomies are an out-right rip off.  They are never ""in-focus"" and only slightly add magnification at any setting. You can do as well with two cardboard tubes from toilet tissue rolls, hold them up to your eyes and pretend you have binoculars!  People selling these should be prosecuted for fraud!"
1.0,"I liked them a lot at first, but they turned my ears green"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:df87f8195e7a66c0bd6aa98a41cfb0f9]] While these are cool they are obviously not the product displayed. There is no button to switch between modes just one switch that randomly flashes through colors and modes willy nilly. So while it's cool definitely not what I paid for and I wouldn't recommend it.
1.0,I can’t imagine any body type that this would flatter!
1.0,The quality of this product is very poor.
1.0,Just tried it on my daughter very uncomfortable I'm not sure she'll be able to walk in the snow with this snowsuit.
1.0,My son wore these for about a week before one of the seams broke. Maybe the manufacturer will warranty them???
1.0,This is my replacement purse it kept opening at the zipper or wouldn’t close right and now this item is doing the same. I liked that it was small and I could take it anywhere but the zipper kept opening up I always have to fight with it to close and I have to close it real slow to stay close
1.0,"I originally  ordered 4 of these (2 black, 1 white, 1 ivory) this in an XL but it fit a little too snug so I returned them and got an XXL. Well the XXL was smaller than the XL! The material was stiff and felt crunchy to me. Couldn't step into the slip nor get it over my breast. Don't know if it was mislabeled or just cheaply made...maybe a bit of both. Either way...these are being returned as well."
1.0,I bought a large and it fits like a small...
1.0,This is a total waste of money. it had faded in 2 weeks and is now an eyesore. Don't bother wasting your money on this. See photo.
1.0,"Disappointed in the color, in the image it shows them as a very dark, with vibrant colors. This is incredibly misleading. Color isn't close. It's a light colored earring with some shine to it when you turn them, or the light hits it. Not at all what's pictured."
1.0,"Put the $$ towards something more expensive.  Week one, it started to tarnish, week two, 2 of the jewels fell out and week 4 literally broke in half.  I got what I paid for I guess."
1.0,Tried to remove it but can't without messing up the shoe! Really love them tho that was my only issue these are coach shoe and they ain't cheep so they should not come with anything on them I'm asking for half of my money back please thank you!
1.0,Wish that I was able to fit this. Ordered a Ski Jacket and got Table Napkins from BALEAF.
1.0,"I don't have the patience to return and exchange seeing as I am handicapped at this time.... followed the sizing chart, pants are not baggy and they hit you in all the wrong places. Yuk, definitely not meant with a woman with a pear shaped figure or hour glass more like stick figured"
1.0,"Kind of a cheap material, not a fan."
1.0,"It’s just like a giant hefty bag with a zipper. NOT puffy at all. NOT close to flattery at all. I felt like I just paid $50 for a trash bag cape.. Seriously biggest waste of time and I’m in a blizzard waiting on trash bags..?? I’m still cold, I guess I will get my trash bags out and zipper.. pathetic excuse for anything really really disappointing"
1.0,"They fell right off my face, and didnt fit in case would not close, I didnt want to have to pay to ship back so just threw in junk draw but guess you get what you pay for!"
1.0,Felt extremely cheap
1.0,"I received them and they were leaking glitter (not proper sealed) I exchanged them and the next set I received were just as bad, if not worse than the first set. Strong plastic smell.  Buy the true Budha girl bangles."
1.0,Returned as it was FAR too large and brim was ridiculously small.
1.0,It broke in a month.<br />Hard to get on and off.<br />Would not recommend it
1.0,Don't fit right!
1.0,"This product is a fake. I (the child using them) noticed that during a baseball practice the sun seemed a little brighter than it should with the glasses on. So I took them off, lo and behold... There was no difference in how everything looked. The Sun was just as bright, and everything was as well. Just that with the glasses on there's a very minimal black tint. So I went and compared them to my other sunglasses, and saw that through the real glasses, everything looked how it should with sunglasses on. Everything looked MUCH darker and I had actual UV protection. And (as shown in the picture) I flipped the glasses around, and I could see RIGHT through the fake one's lenses! While I could see my REFLECTION in the real ones! As I should! Don't buy these unless you want to waste your money on something that can lead to you, or your child, going BLIND."
1.0,I was super excited to get this skirt.  In the pics it looks like the shorter part of the skirt is about 3-4 inches above the knee.  That's not the case.<br /><br />I will say that I'm returning this small size skirt and ordering a medium because I played with it a bit and hiked the skirt way up over my chest and it looks great but too small for my chest.
1.0,Cheap and pins are hard to get to and don't slide in or out eazy. Have to use scissors to push in pins
1.0,Not worth 30 dollars!
1.0,"I really wanted these to work out but nope not at all. They immediately irritated my ears so I tried dipping the hooks in alcohol.  Well, that made it worse. The paint on the wood started dripping and then eventually faded the earrings within 2mins."
1.0,"When I was trying to clean my lens, it popped out of the frame and I had a devil of a time getting it back in. The lenses are probably not polarized and the plastic is very cheap. But a short term solution."
1.0,I was so excited to get this dress but when I opened it and tried it on it was another story it defective.. I am so disappointed save your money don’t buy
1.0,"I have smallish ears and this didn't even sort of fit. And then it broke while I was trying to put it on. So, I'm glad I didn't waste too much money on it."
1.0,No water resistant at all
1.0,You may or may not receive the item displayed by this vendor. The bags I got were not BCW but some off brand I've never seen before . Wouldn't have been a problem if they didn't have the picture and links to BCW.
1.0,Don't buy unless you want this dress to show off all your lumps & bumps.
1.0,Very poor quality. They are extremely short. They look like they were shrunk prior to shipping. I’m very short so this shouldn’t be an issue. However they are so short that it shows my midriff!
1.0,Started out loose and sloopy then shrank at least 2 sizes the first wash
1.0,As soon as I opened the package and went to put it on the silver clasp broke apart. And the band isn’t black like in advertised picture. It’s a brown color. Very cheap. I’m super disappointed!
1.0,no fit
1.0,"I ordered an extra size up, but it was still too small."
1.0,"They look great,  but lasted 1 week. The crown broke off while I was walking. I was not impressed at all."
1.0,Very unhappy! Zippers are all broken and we’ve only had it 2 months and she’s not hard on her stuff! Would never recommend this jacket to anyone!
1.0,big and cheap looking
1.0,Bought these according to description was that they were rulers but are not !
1.0,Material vey thin and cheap quality
1.0,"Garbage just like some other things I've bought from you, I know know why i don't learn!!! Doesn't even a clasping hook. This time I will never buy anything from you!!"
1.0,Ordered twice.  Was broken both times upon arrival
1.0,"Stopped working less than 24 hours after I received it. *******************<br />1/5/2017 This is an updated review of this item. Aurora Watch Company was quick to contact me after they saw my original review. They apologized for the watch not working and offered to send out a new one as a replacement. Unfortunately it did take a while to get to me because I had the first one shipped to an Amazon locker and I forgot to tell them this and they forgot to verify my home address. I finally got it after the holidays and I really like it.<br />I like the size of the face and the overall look of the watch. It is very casual for every day use.<br />********************<br />Another updated review today's date is February 22nd of 2017. The watch has stopped working. At first it just slow down on time, and now it does not work at all. If you are thinking about purchasing this watch or any other watch buy this brand do not do it. They are garbage. Worse than the $8 watch I bought from Walmart."
1.0,I have to throw them away.  It was wasting money. I’m size 4 and purchased medium size.  They were away too small.
1.0,too old lady like
1.0,I ordered a size bigger and it was still way too small.  My arms could barely fit in the sleeves mind you I weight 117lbs I'm not a big person.  Very disappointed.  N to find out that I have to wait 48 hrs to see if the company will even let me return it. Buyer beware
1.0,These we're broken when I received them.
1.0,Size didn’t fit as a 3xl should fit
1.0,"The thread was all pulled already, cheap quality. Couldn’t event wear them once."
1.0,I will be returning this product it looks nothing like the photo
1.0,The shirt was as wide as it was long! Washing did not help! It would have fit a large man as a belly shirt! I ordered a size medium
1.0,"Just received my wallet. I put 6 cards in the card slots....ripped! So sad because it is beautiful. If you want a cheaply made wallet, go for it!"
1.0,READ REVIEWS the masks are way too small. It doesn't even cover my face. Recommended for petite men/women.
1.0,"Legs designed for 6' 2"", arms and top designed for toddler."
1.0,The purple color bled all over the white strip after I washed it. Terrible quality.
1.0,Good product; does the job ordered the black one to but somebody screwed up and sent another of the khaki.
1.0,Actually siren song deserves no stars I got it and it didn't work beware of Amazon and bought it from them and we believe somebody had it before us
1.0,"Picture the most unbecoming top you have tried on and multiply that by 10! This is made from the kind of cheap nylon that gets runs; it feels somewhat soft on the outside and scratchy on the inside next to the skin. The worst part of the design is the pocket ""flap"" placement, the tabs stick out like wings so unless you are built like a stick (and even then) no one I know enjoys having their midsection made to look wider ...that is exactly what this does. Its like wearing a triangle!!"
1.0,"I can't imagine the person that these socks would fit, the length & heel fit fine but the toes are so wide I had an inch of material left on each side, can you imagine how irritating to your foot that would be?  Do Not Buy These Socks!!!"
1.0,They are not comfortable
1.0,"Very poor quality, ultra thin, and undersized."
1.0,The thread they use is thin it broke less than a month
1.0,It is smaller than pictured and looks like something for a child and not an accomplished nurse! I had to reorder a different one.
1.0,I ordered black hawthorn leggings and I got sent camo colorful koala leggings. sketchy brand don’t order it’s not worth it. also came with white dog hair on if I don’t even have a dog or own any white pets.
1.0,"Super cheap.  the product is not even close to look like the one in the picture,  don’t Waste your money."
1.0,"A stone fell out after a few days, the small stone.  Plus now it's starting to tarnish."
1.0,Didn't like it at all.<br />Deceiving in picture  and truly a horrible plactic shinning  tarp with no define lines to fit like a jacket color wads off as well.  Pretty sure it was a wish merchandise.
1.0,"Ordered it, it looks nothing like the picture.. it looks like a child's large. I ordered it in an XL so that just tells you how their sizing is. The sewing is not good at all. Don't waste your money.."
1.0,Nan waste
1.0,Doesn’t fit
1.0,It’s too small. The bands are not long enough.
1.0,Poor quality of wood. The little part that goes through your ear is very hard to get out. Ear still hurts 2-3 days after I wore it. Do NOT buy this. Im even afraid I might a splinter if wear these again.

1.0,broke the first time opened. I returned the product with no problems.
1.0,Garbage material
1.0,"It is NOT nickle free as described, my finger immediately turned green. Stones are crooked, prongs are bent into the stone."
1.0,A pair of all black aviators came in. Really sad because i wanted and ordered the pink lens glasses. I'm not sure if it was just a 1 time mistake so i'm nervous to try and order them again. Really dissappointed.
1.0,Cheap t shirt. Does not match pictures or descriptions. XL looks like a medium
1.0,I’m so sad because these are so cute and my son really seems to like them unfortunately the Velcro became unstitched after only two days of light use inside out home.. he’s crawling and starts standing and these encourage him to do so because of the squeaking noise.. debating if I should give them another try or just return them all together<br />———————————————————————<br />I decided to see the Velcro back on myself since my baby scuffed then a little because we were practicing walking on the cement but only a week after receiving them the sole tore from the sandal and the thread from the straps started coming out I’m so disappointed because I really like them and I hope it’s just a bad pair
1.0,They are very uncomfortable!!!!! I ordered an XL and I followed the chart guidelines. It was digging in to my shoulders. I am definitely returning them.
1.0,Product is deff not ment for any child.. it was clearly made for infant babies.. you can hear literally everything while wearing them..... not even a ear shaped hole for the ear.... like odd shaped oval

1.0,Poor quality material used.  Very disappointed with dress.
1.0,"THIS IS A FAKE SHELLY COVE SHIRT. NOT OFFICIALLY LICENSED BY SHELLY COVE BRAND, AND IS A WASTE OF MONEY. SHIRTS BY SHELLY COVE ARE COMFORT COLORS, AND THE KNOCK-OFF IS MARKED AS MOKINGTOP. SHIRTS ON OFFICIAL WEBSITE ARE ONLY $10 MORE THAN THIS PRODUCT. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY"
1.0,So very lightweight but felt and sounded like tissue paper. Some of the snaps were hard to open while others wouldn’t stay closed.
1.0,This charm is not for a bracelet it is huge. This would be better used for a necklace which my mom can't wear in her line of work. This is a Christmas gift and I'm very upset!
1.0,The key chain is poorly made and was not worth more than $1.00.  I was going to put it in with a Christmas gift but absolutely not going to do that!
1.0,"If looking like MC Hammer is your goal, then these pants are perfect for you.  Google it.  I was hoping for some cute pants to travel in Europe this summer and boy was I wrong.  The craziest fit ever."
1.0,Seam came out after 2 wears and wasnt even washed.

1.0,I thought it would look exactly like in the picture but it’s nothing compared to that very disappointed
1.0,"The band itself is too thin, and the cups, for the size that I ordered, were too small. It was massively uncomfortable"
1.0,Me gusto como se miraba como me quedaba pero se descosió el mismo día que Melo puse de una manga! Eso no me gusto
1.0,This is NOT stainless Steele. My daughter’s bracelet is Turing copper!  Very disappointed in this.
1.0,"Broke already, the head broke off and makes your finger green! Disappointed"
1.0,I normally wear an XL and I bought an XXL.  Its wayyyy too small.  It looks like a medium.  This will be returned.
1.0,"Update 6 hours later.  I am lifting my arm to teach and a student tells me there is a hole in the empire.<br /><br />The frustrating part is, it’s no longer offered in this color or size so I can return it but not have the dress. I love the dress and have been given lots of compliments but what is going to happen when I wash it?<br /><br />As a teacher this dress is both very functional, professional and comfortable! ❤️It"
1.0,Unadjustable and very wide Very low quality
1.0,In pic it looked so nice but as u received it its more like a kids anklet. Waste my money
1.0,Encoje
1.0,The first two I opened to attach to my mask had broken clasps.
1.0,"I measure at a 34 band but would have needed a 36 in this bra.  The cups were a total no-go as well.  I even ordered up a size just in case, knowing this was a s tight garment.  There is no way I can wear this, so it's going back.  I might consider getting another but I'd have no idea where to start with size!"
1.0,Poor design. Will not stay fastened.
1.0,"Cheaply made out of thin spandex kind of like what cheap granny panties are made off,so thin! Way too big no true to size. Bottoms are thinner than the top so disappointed"
1.0,It was too small for my husband and it looked more like a women's shirt.
1.0,I bought two of these skirts and both of them tore the first time I wore them
1.0,Cheap quality. Not as expected. Had I known this I would’ve never bought it
1.0,"Washed it once and the nose came off, figured out it wasn’t sowed on but glued on?"
1.0,These hats are marketed towards dads but were too small even for my 11 year old. I had a double order for my husband and 15 year old. Waste of money.
1.0,"This umbrella comes disassembled and the instructions do not cover all that is involved. It took us about an hour to assemble this umbrella. As for quality,  it's subpar.  I'm guessing we will get one season out of it.  In my opinion, spend the money and buy a better quality product. I would not buy again."
1.0,Nowhere near the size it's supposed to be
1.0,"These are giant. I'm 5'10 and 130lbs, I have narrow hips and a little booty. I ordered a small and they are very big on me. They're very cheap (loose strings all over the place, weird knee hole placement, and the front pockets are huge). These pants would probably look nice on a person with a voluptuous frame."
1.0,Bad leather n smells bad
1.0,They're cheap for a reason. One pull to tie them and snap. Both laces gone in 10 seconds. Don't bother buying these.
1.0,Little did I know when I ordered this that all I needed was to start putting castor oil on my lashes at nite and in the morn and I would never have to spend $ on lashes again. Also b4 I put mascara on mow I put castor oil on my lashes and primer and I get accused of wearing falsies!
1.0,Seemed nice but broke apart after 2 months and of course I am 6 days late to return.
1.0,The actual material is more chiffon then a spandex material and its not figure flattering. Also there was a hole in pocket and the holes for the tie were large and super obvious.
1.0,"el relleno no es suficiente para su función, debería ser mas grande.  No lo recomiendo"
1.0,Does not fit to size. Fits too small. I wear a 2x and ordered a 4x so it would be baggy and snuggly. Not at all! Barley fits comfortably.
1.0,Material it tight and form fitting for an infant it has no give in the material. Very cute and I like the idea but the material needs to be more forgiving
1.0,The item was delivered damaged
1.0,"Never worn. Washed in cold water never dried, logo bled all over. Very thankful it didn’t transfer to my other items."
1.0,Very poor and blurry photo on the mask. It was going to be a gift but I couldn’t give it!

1.0,These earrings are huge!! Very tacky!
1.0,It did not come with small purple stone as advertised.It was a brownish red..not attractive
1.0,"I've already given this top away, it looks terrible on. Though I'd love the hemline but it ends up looking like a pajama top. Pass."
1.0,I bought a size larger than I am just incase and it's was soooo small I couldn't even clasp the clasps!
1.0,Cheap. Ripped after one wear/wash and now return window has closed.
1.0,Never would by again can’t we are it
1.0,"You can get much better quality for better prices at actual jewelry stores. They are an I3 which means on a scale of how many inclusions these diamons have (black specks in the diamond) they are the lowest. The only jewelry store that actually sells these low quality diamonds are fred meyers jewelry, all other stores like those owned by sterling jewelry can not go below than an I2. At an I3 those black specks are going to be noticable to the naked eye and look practically like salt and pepper at that point. Coming from a Diamontologist and Gemologist."
1.0,Cheap junk. Buckle stay is weak. If you want your watch falling off buy this. I have other NATO that are twice as thick and the hardware is much better. This band us junk. Highly disappointed. Do not trust your watch to this band.
1.0,Not all the pearl beads are real pearls and it is way too small for the average woman's wrist.

1.0,Great quality shirt. Wrong size sent.
1.0,A lot smaller then they appear in picture
1.0,"Horrible! Fall apart cheap feeling. And you can not even see through these everything is green, and when you look at your phone it’s like 3D headache inducing"
1.0,"Very pretty to bad it doesn't fit, clasp is broke, cheap clasp, oddly made chain lengths. Cheap cheap cheap cheap"
1.0,I ordered a 3x and it would not fit over my shoulders. I gave to my daughter who is a size 10.
1.0,A little to small for my 10 year old daughter. Also make sure you wash it before using will leave black lent balls all over face and clothes.
1.0,These do not stay on the ear without having to bend it. Even then I was afraid I'd break it because of the material. Not impressed.
1.0,Sizes are way off!  XL would fit a US SIZE 7.<br />And no where near tall enough to reach over the calf. They didn’t last more than 3 wearing/washing cycles!!
1.0,"These socks are so, so so SMALL. Could not even get my foot in these. Feels like these socks they sent are childrens socks and not men,s socks. Instead of throwing them out,  I gave the 10 pair I bought to a local charity. They help children. Even they said they look like childrens socks.  I clearly would never buy these socks again !!!"
1.0,Unravel quickly!!
1.0,THE PICTURE SHOWS 6 DIFFERENT CHARMS.  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY THERE ARE ONLY 3 CHARMS PER ORDER.<br />I FEEL THIS IS MISREPRESENTED.
1.0,didnt fit right but it was a great shirt; NICE COLOR AND STYLE
1.0,Product arrived broken.  Very cheap quality definitely not work $4.00 more like $.25.  My daughter was very disappointed.

1.0,Very itchy!
1.0,"I dunno if it was just an issue w the dress I received, but the dress was sewn odd, it made a double layer over the chest area, I had to return"
1.0,"Very Small. I bought this for my sister's boyfriend, but it could barely fit my sister's wrist and she's a size 0. I had to return it.<br />it's a shame because it's a really beautiful design, but the shape barely fits a wrist... maybe it was made for children?"
1.0,"Horrible, everything looked very cheap"
1.0,Purchased to large went to order a smaller size and found strange pricing.  Large is $21 and Med is $42<br />Obviously did not order second pair.
1.0,Read 92 but an actual thermometer read 98.
1.0,"I was so excited for these! However, they arrived with the turquoise stones facing backwards, so the color wasn't even visible from the front or side. I wore them anyways and one stone broke off after the second time. What a disappointment!"
1.0,It's a cute apron but not really functionable due to the stitching was all out of whack like a ten-year-old had made it. I got it so cheap it really wasn't worth the time of sending it back.
1.0,Cheap broke within minutes of wearing
1.0,"I have purchased several of these leggings. I love the colors, patterns and how soft they are. I ordered two of these shorter ones for the warmer weather and loved them and so I bought 2 more to get me through the summer. Well, when they arrived I tried on the first pair and noticed there was a hole in the crotch and a giant one on the upper thigh area and the second one has two smaller holes on the butt and a few rips on the seam. This is upsetting. I finally thought I found a great brand. I don't know if they are using cheaper fabric, but these are not the same leggings I have purchased!"
1.0,"First we didn't receive the package after it said it was delivered. Then when we did get it finally, it broke after a couple weeks."
1.0,Waaaaaay too small.
1.0,Very unflattering and not comfortable
1.0,Very short. The back of it was showing my butt. Very thin cheap fabric.
1.0,i dont think i orderd #7 i belive i ordered # 3 pique.
1.0,Stitching on front leg is coming undone after one wash.<br />Hole in crotch before second wash.<br />These are garbage.

1.0,It's wasn't look like the picture
1.0,Cheap wood
1.0,These shorts creep up on you and give you a wedgy!
1.0,Had a very bad taste to it
1.0,"I ordered 2 of the coats that Solitaire had in Large, they fit fine.  But, the arms on this Large tunic top are really too tight to be comfortable and they did not have an Extra Large or I would have returned it for the bigger size.  I am dsappointed."
1.0,"The item was subpar quality, to the point the material was see through. The item ran small, so you may want to order a size up. The pants did not look like the picture ( the waist and tie did not appear the same) , and were returned."
1.0,Terrible fit. Way too tight maybe would fit a chicken leg but not an average person leg
1.0,It broke the next day..... no stars
1.0,"The hat was not youth size, it was a osfa, was a little to big."
1.0,"I bought this as a birthday present for a child and in less than 24 hours, the screen blacked out and stopped working."
1.0,The dress was way too small and nothing I expected
1.0,Battery died in 3 days
1.0,This swimsuit is a piece of junk! The bow on the headband fell off when taking it out of the plastic bag it came in and the bow on the front of the swimming suit fell off completely as well when putting it on my daughter for the very first time. Don’t waste your money on this!
1.0,"When I got the hat, it wasn't even close to what the pictured showed. It was a very cheap looking hat. Very disappointing."
1.0,At first it was fine but then the Virgin Mary just came out. It’s like it was glued to the little plate and it just wouldn’t stick anymore. Very annoying and very disappointing.
1.0,The watch had scratches on the strap. Didn’t like it
1.0,Don't like how they look on me
1.0,"I love four leaf clovers, but it did not bring me much luck."
1.0,"Don't waste your money, mine fell apart right when I took it out of the bag =-["
1.0,They don’t fit everyone and it’s really annoying
1.0,Please don’t bother buying this dress. Zipper came broken and it looked like a joke. Cheap material. Thing I probably liked most was the belt. Not same dress as photo
1.0,"These were so uneven! I tried to fix them and I couldn’t, I have the trash these because of how bad they were. I was supposed to wear these for a Big event and now my whole outfit is thrown off."
1.0,"Bent, nicked, kinked all over.  Totally unusable as a gift. Returning immediately. I will NEVER purchase gold jewelry on Amazon ever again"
1.0,Too heavy. Caused an infection on my ear. The metal is cheap
1.0,Didn’t like it<br />Easy return
1.0,This is a VERY large watch. Not atractive. I ame a woman that works in a traditionaly mans position unloading trailers at a warehouse. I needed a watch that would help me clock in and out on time. The picture looked great. Not so much in person.
1.0,"Did not come with any instructions for setting alarm or moon. Good watch for timer, time, and date. That's it though.!"
1.0,"these pants ARE NOT WORTH 31.99<br /><br />9.99 yes but 31.99 no.<br /><br />they are short not true to size and material is cheap, very dissapointed."
1.0,"This is bot leather. Poor quality, I am very dissatisfied."
1.0,"These dresses are sized for super THIN women. I ordered a 3x for my bust, and the dresses I received fit more to an XL. My chest had NO breathing room! Greatly disappointed. Returned item and received full refund."
1.0,Good luck getting your money back!!
1.0,Too large the top.
1.0,False description. No bling or sequins which is the only reason I bought it so very disappointed when I received it. Not a pretty print either.
1.0,This is mis-sized and as cheap as cheap can be. Horrible fabric.
1.0,I am 6 ' 3 this was so small I gave it to my little daughter..
1.0,To small the sizing was not right.
1.0,"They're super thin, they rip when you put them on or breath too heavily, and they're not nitrile and vinyl; they're just nitrile. These are terrible! DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"When i bought the watch the description said absolutely nothing about it being a pulse watch....when it arrived it worked andd then stopped and has been like that ever since...it works on and off, so i assume it works only with your pulse.....if i knew this, i wouldnt have bought it as a gift...now i have to ask the guy i gave it to if its working... how embarassing!!!"
1.0,"This sweatshirt is not as pictured. Although there is nothing in the description to tell you, the ""tie dye"" is printed on the fabric. The pictures show the dye having gone through the fabric to the inside, however the print does not, the inside is completely white."
1.0,Terrible! The only thing these glassed did was turn the headlight glare yellow. The side lense was broken out and was obviously cheap plastic. Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,Need a looser fit around the hips
1.0,Horrible fit. The boob cups were placed in an odd position and did not cover very well. I made sure to follow the sizing instructions as well. Tried to return and never got a refund.
1.0,SUPER FLEMSY BROKE FIRST TIME I WORE IT
1.0,Not the quality expected.<br />Not useful for me.
1.0,"Super uncomfortable, material felt weird, and the dress size ran way too small."
1.0,"I got this for my girlfriend and it broke before she could even put it on, I guess you get what you pay for"
1.0,It is not as expressed at all. Just a rectangle dress with a slit on each side
1.0,"Pulls my hair when I put them on,around the ears"
1.0,Horrible quality and not as described horrible horrible horrible
1.0,"Bummer. Fits perfectly & looks good, but the material is far too thin to be considered a ‘mask’. You can breathe thru it.  It’s just a flimsy covering. Nothing I’d recommend for anyone who is visiting elderly / sick."
1.0,"The product description explicitly states that the &#34;boy bye&#34; is embroidered, however, the hat I received was poorly screen printed. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Very poor quality. Was all ready turning.
1.0,Wow is this cheap looking. And the color is way darker than the photo. Awful!
1.0,"Sent straight back due to the material; it was the oddest, weirdest, grossest material ever, almost like spandex. Had it been made with any other 'normal' material it would've been nice, as I did like the design and colors"
1.0,I am not able to test with it on.
1.0,"i brought an adjustable, anti-slip  knee pads for my girl baby. I'm a bit unsatisfied on the product due to every time my baby crawl, it always go down under her knee. it doesn't function on its purpose.<br /><br />The tape doesn't sticking much and the cushion is not enough.  this is my honest comment  about this product."
1.0,Not even 24 hours after putting it on it broke!!
1.0,I got a size small and it felt like a medium to large. Im 5'7 120 pounds 34a bra size.
1.0,Thin cheap cheap cheap material. I ordered the size recommended and it could fit a barbie doll.
1.0,It fits the way it’s suppose to but looks like a costume!
1.0,Looks like you are wearing a potato sac
1.0,"They got fine at the start of my day, but by the time I get to the office they are rolling off of my heels. I stop many times during my work day to pull the sock back around my heel. Too bad I bought 2 packs!"
1.0,"Super bummed on this dress. I wanted to love it, but just couldn't. The first one was too big. The second was ok, but the black fanric was fully faded an awful smell. It's super cute in photo but poorly made."
1.0,This product took a really long time to get to my home so much so that is was no longer needed. Additionally the belt advertised is grey and the belt I received is beige. Poor quality.
1.0,"While the pendant was very cute, the clasp on the necklace arrived broken. I wrote to the seller but received no reply. Unfortunately, I will return this product."
1.0,The quality is below average the slots are tight and if you use all of them its even tighter the RFID blocking does not work. I have a RFID card for work and it can read through the wallet even 8 inches away. If I didn't need a wallet it would be in the trash. I will definitely not buy from this company every again. You get what you pay for and it seems 18$ for a wallet is what you would spend on a child's first wallet
1.0,Do not like this at all.  Looks better online.
1.0,These run extremely small. Order two or three sizes up!
1.0,This hat is definitely much smaller than expected. Had to send it back. My head is 7 1/2. This hat comes nowhere close to that
1.0,"In less than 3 weeks the sandals have fall apart, very poor quality. Waist of money"
1.0,"Frame looks beautiful but NEVER was tight and constantly got loose and crooked..,"
1.0,Gems broke off within the first 3 days and the black part scraped off within the first month.
1.0,"This dress is way to short! The seems come up way to far. If the child bends over, everything will show! Bought this for a daddy daughter dance that's Hawaiian themed this weekend. Not recommended!"
1.0,Very ugly material
1.0,"Item not as described. It is a beanie, but not slouchy at all"
1.0,It was a good looking coat but it runs super small
1.0,This shirt runs very big
1.0,They aren't at all like the picture. The lenses are a brownish and yellow colors not blue and the nose piece is at a complete angle.
1.0,"Ordered size 40, Says size 40 on product at 2 locations, but waaaaay smaller. I bet they are smaller than 32!!<br />Did more research. The waist measure is very close to the other sz 40 pants I have. Might fit person with super short waist and no butt. Strange. They provided full refund."
1.0,"Horrible, no quality control. I a least though it would be perfect for Hallowern, not even that. I ordered 2 a small and a medium or a medium and a large thinking I could get it to fall as nicely on me as pictured. Needless to say, nope!"
1.0,Item is soft but cheaply made.  It came in the mail folded into quarters.  The item will not lay flat.  It is shaped like a bowl.  The edges pop up whenever stepped on or pressed.
1.0,The white on this shirt is very see-through. Not pleased with the overall quality. The fabric is rough as well.
1.0,its crap
1.0,Very poor quality. Both ripped in 1 day of wearing. Amazon please refund
1.0,Will not use. Too small. Not available in larger size. Issues with return.
1.0,Definitely not like the picture. Cheap material poorly made
1.0,They run super big. One size less is still<br />Big on my daughter. Frustrating having to buy three different sizes to get a little closer to her size.
1.0,I loved these bracelets. I bought them in every color and unfortunately some of them came with the gems already off in the packaging and as the hours went by of wearing them the stones one by one all fell out. Very unfortunately b/c they were all very stunning.
1.0,Shirt was way too small. Did not fit well ans had a small rip on the side of the shirt.
1.0,"Don't waste your money. They are pressed board with a picture of enamel on them. A real disappointment, I feel cheated."
1.0,"These are horrible not breathable at all, I had to throw them all in the trash after a week of wearing them."
1.0,Pretty earring<br />Only one was in box
1.0,Arm float detached first time used
1.0,"Very small , looks like something from toy store."
1.0,These driving glasses do not perform as advertised ... make driving worse than without them.
1.0,"Runs WAAAAAAY small. I'm 5'3&#34; and am somewhere in the 135-140lbs range and ordered an XL. I wanted to wear it a little baggy like it is in the picture, but it was SO TIGHT you could see through it.. Such a bummer :("
1.0,Broke after a few weeks on my keychain!!
1.0,"Not leather, ultra cheap feeling. Don’t waste your money"
1.0,"It may work for some, but it fit me awkwardly in the chest & underarm area. The sleeves were also much more exaggerated than they look in the photo."
1.0,Super tight not really able to breath
1.0,I hate to be the first to leave a negative review but This top looks nothing like the photo. The material on the arms has a cheap sheen to<br />It. The pattern on the sleeves looks very different as well. I read to size up so i got a medium. I would stick to your normal size if you decide to order.
1.0,Already falling apart after one use...
1.0,These look nothing like the picture. They are almost clear and cheap plastic.
1.0,"Not sterling silver, it's nickel. I knew it wasn't silver from the price, but I figured at least the posts would be stainless steel. Nope, almost had to go to the hospital due to infection."
1.0,"Horrible quality, horribly constructed, do not buy"
1.0,"Cheap materials.  The silver disk and black tree are separate pieces, which I don't care for - especially b/c one of them doesn't lay flat against the other.  And the ""frosted"" silver disk is actually glitter.  Yuck.  These might work for a Halloween costume, but not a normal day and certainly not for a professional look.  Thankfully, they were inexpensive b/c they're not worth my time to return."
1.0,Somehow I pictured this product as an Over The Top Fit as opposed to 1 strap between Big and 2nd Toe. This is uncomfortable to me and not sure how I confused it otherwise. May be fine to others but not me. Looking to Return these
1.0,"I ordered a size 2X, even  though I only wear a XL. These eun very, very small and more like a petite"
1.0,"Purchased this to wear while tanning. Used it three time before the main seam started coming apart. Otherwise, it was fine. Stretchy, comfortable material. Generously sized for the average guy. Would have given it a five star review had it been better constructed and not fallen apart so soon."
1.0,The material was so cheap and felt uncomfortable
1.0,"It cost me more to return these awful things than they are worth. You would get what you pay for if they were 30 cents. The design is so beautiful but they show up reeking like a chemical sweat shop, with glue tracks and bubbles in the outer material. These would work for strippers only because they would never be seen in the light. Idk how there are any positive reviews."
1.0,After wearing my new sunglasses ONCE I noticed the second time I put them on one lens was scratched to the point I couldn’t see out of it! Super disappointing because I put them in a zippered cloth pouch in my purse. Although I really like the shape and fit of these glasses I highly recommend NOT buying them. The lenses are made out of very cheap plastic (like cheapie children’s sunglasses).
1.0,Crystal looks nice but the setting is Charming Charlies awful. That can't be a real rose gold setting. Do not believe the original price.
1.0,I was so excited to wear this item for my 35th Boho themed party. I opened the package the day of my event and there was only one anklet in the pack.
1.0,Locks stopped working in less than a year<br /><br />Lock mechanism not in warranty and not easy to ship it to get it fixed stopped using it
1.0,"Very pretty green color and flattering fit, but arrived with a giant hole in the seam of the outer lining of the dress."
1.0,Sorry poor fit and did not come in correct size
1.0,The watch was a gift. Way too small and no links to make it bigger. Watch was returned.
1.0,Nice idea but beanie is too small for my head ... very uncomfortable.
1.0,"I bought these shirts for my son’s soccer team to wear. After one wash (before he even wore it once), it is ripping along the seam where the arm is stitched to the body of the shirt. Poor quality stitching."
1.0,The bottoms on these are inappropriate for a kid.  They don't even cover my daughter's cheeks.  It is similar to a thong which a 10 year does not need to be wearing at a beach!
1.0,Nice fit. The left side had big holes in it. Very disappointing!
1.0,"The product was nothing like what was shown on the model. The material was thin and the product runs way small, more for children. I won't purchase form there again as it is shipped fron China and it's a large expense to ship it back."
1.0,"I looked at these pants but I will NEVER buy from this company. Read their description, “Great to hide your thick legs” and “waist closing effect makes your body look better”.<br />Do you seriously think women want your opinion and fashion advice about their bodies before buying?!?"
1.0,It tarnished in one day...descriprion said stainless steel...
1.0,"I believe I got the wrong size but I don’t like the fabric it’s like bed sheets it’s really thin and feels like a curtain and if you wash it too much it might fray at the seems, it feels real cheaply made to me, I got an lx but I probably could use a large inside but even then it’s the way it feels"
1.0,Dont buy these.  They are very hard to see through.
1.0,The optics are not very good... the colors and clarity are warped and sub par.
1.0,Had to tie the string yourself and I can’t figure it out! It’s too confusing and it’s a waste of money!
1.0,"Be warned that these bags each hold ONE shoe each (unless you've got flip-flops).  Seem to be great quality, but I'm going to have to find a use for them other than holding my shoes when I travel.  I felt really misled when I got them."
1.0,Large size did not fit a 40 inch waist. Buckle impossible to release.  A waste of time will return.
1.0,They are not medium are way too small so I return them.
1.0,Nice looking but holes in toes first wearing.
1.0,Thought I would get a lot of wear out of these. Sole had tons of cushion but not heavy but toe strap broke during my vacation after wearing initially. Such a disappointment and didn’t expect this brand to have such poor quality. Buyer beware.
1.0,They are very cute wish they had different ring sizes though
1.0,"The fabric is nothing like you’d expect. & it’s definitely not a baggy crew neck sweatshirt like you’d expect. It’s made of a spandex material & has a slight turtle neck collar. Also, the sleeves are about 3/4 the length of my arms. Very ugly. Would not waste your money."
1.0,Looks great on picture but in person is not pretty. Extremely cheap quality. I do not recommend.
1.0,Sleeves were short for the size we chose and the pants were tight my husband is regular lean 5ft 11 but it was not for his size
1.0,When i recieved this item it was broken
1.0,The fabric is so thin it’s almost like tissue paper. You can see right through it and it feels like it would tear at the slightest pull.
1.0,They were super long and very tight. Fit my 4yo more like capris rather than shorts. Ended up returning.
1.0,Definitely not a large. Top fit weird on a bustier woman. Underskirt no where near long enough. Disappointed.
1.0,Buckle cheaply made.
1.0,Design is horrible nothing like the pictures.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt XL size the label on the shirt said XL however, on me the shirt looked like a S. I couldn't hardly get my arms through it. They also had a XXL size in this shirt but, the way the XL fit I know the XXL would be to small also."
1.0,I've bought two of these belts for my son since March. Both have broken in the same place on the buckle. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,They stay on for about 3 minutes then fall off then can’t find it
1.0,"As much as I love the design of this dress,  the sequins are poorly sewn on and are falling off and in all likelihood will fall off even more upon first wearing and will definitely fall off upon first laundering. Unfortunately. I'm returning it."
1.0,"Poor quality product!! I purchased this band at the end of April. Part of the band did not stay put on the watch, causing the band to snap off unpredictably. Two weeks ago, the band finally broke. I haven't had this product for a month yet and am having to purchase a new one elsewhere."
1.0,Chain broke right at the class only had since January 31 would like vendor to contact us to see about replacement
1.0,Great material but size is not at all a large!
1.0,"Unless your wrist exactly matches the full size of the watch, you're in for quite a ride. First of all the 4 step single page instructions are sorely lacking in how-to's. Like how to open the butterfly clasp. I've had butterfly clasps before but what I saw was a solid piece of metal. I had to go back to the product page on Amazon where they have a photo showing that you're supposed to squeeze the sides. I must be an idiot for not knowing that.<br /><br />Butterfly mystery resolved I started to size the band per their instructions. Pretty easy to get the pins out. But look at my photo of the instructions where step 4 has you pushing in the pin to reconnect the bands with the, yep, head of the pin on the tool.  I thought they might have a different tool for this and I found two more tools - exactly the same. Look at my picture of the actual tool, band, and pin.<br /><br />To even use the tool you have to push the super thin pin in most of the way.  I couldn't do it. Good luck to anyone who can. It didn't exactly slip right in, and of course it's not supposed to or the bands would easily come apart.  Even if it had, I would then have had to use the head of a pin to push the other pin fully inside.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />The only way I can size this is to go to a watch or jewelry store and have them do it. Not about to.<br /><br />Less than an hour after receiving it I'm returning it."
1.0,The lace punctures any time I try to pull them up or down. I wore them one time and they are ruined with holes.  I am disappointed.
1.0,Se arruga fácil. Talla M parece L
1.0,Too big and too stiff. Looks cheap. I returned it.
1.0,Sent it back. Run small
1.0,Broke the first time I tried to wear it.
1.0,to small for my 9 year old
1.0,Trun neck green . This was not sterling silver.
1.0,After 3 weeks stretched a lost stability
1.0,It runs small and it’s suppose to be a dress but I found it to be more of a shirt. Once I tried it on it was very itchy felt like a wool sweater.
1.0,Look like someone wore it
1.0,"Yes, I realize it's not an expensive piece of jewelry, but it still feels cheap with that in mind. It's a bit bulky but does fit accurately. I have another titanium band that actually feels like metal, this feels like plastic.<br /><br />Update:  After a week this ring is basically broken and ready to be tossed in the trash. The &#34;wood&#34; has become unglued from the &#34;titanium&#34; and freely spins around. Again, yes it was cheap, but was still a waste of money. Buy anything else.<br /><br />I decided since I wasn't going to wear this anymore that I'd crack it open to see what it looks like. No surprise, not wood, just acrylic on top of a picture of wood. All these positive reviews must be fake because there are no redeemable qualities for this item."
1.0,I find Asian sizing confusing. These pants were too large so I returned them.
1.0,"Huge. Way too big..I had a small I am 5'1"" and 125 and the dress was wayyyy to big. A small could have been XXL."
1.0,It’s crap.  Tearing on both sides and I only put a wallet and phone in it!  Nothing heavy.  Product is made cheap!!!
1.0,The coat is made of very cheap fleece like material. The sleeves are like 3/4 sleeves when I put it on. It was so tight and uncomfortable. The large would probably fit a 10 year old. Not an adult. I am very disappointed.
1.0,This material is thin and cheap. The pants look like part of a K-Mart Halloween costume. I returned mine.
1.0,"The straps barely stretch, it's like playing tug-o-war for a leather boots with a ram statue and losing.<br />The sizes are ridiculous. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"came on time and was excited bout getting it, but was disappointed when i tore into the package. the detail in it sux and the thing is to big for my ear. when i went to try on the earring i had to try shove my ear in the wedge just to get it to stop falling, but it didnt work. i gave it to a friend and i dont think she even wears it..."
1.0,the fabric is not comfortable at all its terrible for summer months. The fabric looks cheap not like in the picture.
1.0,I was able to get the bottom one done correctly but that was only after I messed up the top one. The issue with this is the pictures in the instructions are very blurry. So you can't tell which way you're supposed to Face the adhesive before putting it on your teeth. Which is how I realized I messed up the first time and now I can't use it anymore.
1.0,"cute top, but runs small"
1.0,"you can't tighten it to make it smaller, and it is huge"
1.0,Zipper broke the first time I used it.
1.0,Rubbish quality
1.0,"white the fabric is beautiful and the skirt fit almost too large, the top, which I measured for prior to ordering does not close the way it does in the photo and is so revealing, I couldn't wear this anywhere. I am sadly disappointed with the sellers sizing charts as well as their product. One item fitting large the other piece too small. AFTER I measured according to guidelines. THIS is the type of thing that should get you kicked off of Amazon because it causes people to NEVER EVER want to order clothing because the sizing is so screwed up and often misrepresented as in this scenario. ."
1.0,The pinch broke the first day my son used it. Very cheap product. Do not recommend.
1.0,Chain broke in a month.  (While taking off shirt.)<br />Not happy
1.0,They could be cute ..but came without a hook so they cannot be worn at all. I said the feathers came all separated. I'm trying to contact them to have them send another pair.
1.0,"Bought in the purple and the black. The black came way too small and is not friendly to girls with big thighs. Purple was perfect and was long enough to work out in comfortably. I'm 5'8 and usually wear a medium. Ordered a large in both, so maybe size up? Purple still had compression to them in the size up."
1.0,Piece of junk.  The rounded hem isn’t even glass or anything of that sort.  It’s cheap plastic with a bad print out in the back that looks more like it was damaged then enhances the reflection...or lack there of.  The watch takes some real effort to get open.  Not even remotely worth the money or the wait.  Horribly disappointing product.
1.0,Tarnished very quickly and the heart pendant fell off after about a week
1.0,NEVER WORE
1.0,Since when does Michael Kors use heavy polyester lining? I believe it’s NOT Michael Kors - steer clear feels like a stiff trash bag
1.0,"Product fits perfectly; I bought a size 3XL and I’m a US size 18. Now, the belt was way too small for my waistline"
1.0,Broke after 30’ of usage. Terrible quality
1.0,It is not one bracelet. It is three separate ones that are not connected in any way.  When it arrived it was literally just thrown in the box so there was no way to know what each bracelet said.
1.0,"Super thin, shorts unde the pants are just below the butt cheeks. I order a XL and could have were a medium.  They run really bjg."
1.0,The slit of the dress made it impossible to wear without leggings. I'm 5'4 and wear an XL. It fit great everywhere but the slit made me feel like everyone would get a show if I moved wrong. My teenage daughter wears it with leggings and it looks great!
1.0,Doesn’t fit Apple Watch. The metal piece that slides into the watch face is too big. It won’t slide into the slot at all.
1.0,this looks sooooooo cheap and i totally hate it... i couldnt wear it and  go out.. its not what i was expecting from what i sow in this picture
1.0,Absolutely not what I expected.  Stained collar and very baggy. More than  expected
1.0,My son broke this the first day he had it. The actual pendant broke right in half
1.0,In girls section. Not girls. For women. Rrrrrrrrrrr
1.0,Did not like the fit or the material
1.0,"Reboxed in a Merrell box, scuff marks on the boots, obviously a used product. Returned."
1.0,The umbrella has so much trouble opening I hurt my fingers everytime!
1.0,Cheap material and tore first wear.
1.0,This product is very cheep .the same day I received the item the crystal came off didn't even have time to wear it.
1.0,"Got the smallest size available and it's still wayyyyyy too big for me, and also the straps are really long so even though it looks like it might have a one-size-fits-all fix to it, for me it really doesn't. It feels like a stiff, cardboard box hanging from my body, not at all flattering or comfortable. Also I think it's not only sized up for wider women, but for taller ones; this did not look like a midriff as shown in the photo on me, but like a regular-length shirt with a weird, strappy &#34;belt&#34; attached. Stay away from this product if you are horizontally and/or vertically challenged!!!"
1.0,"This is a windcheater polyster material, thinner than a piece of paper. Feels and looks cheap. I do not recommend it"
1.0,Son muy chipin
1.0,The closing of the purse arrived broken. I can not use it at my cousin's wedding this Saturday
1.0,"I bought these as birthday gifts for my girlfriends & myself. We LOVED the colors! Very unique & fun. I wore mine almost everyday...for a week, until it broke. Cheap. You get what you paid for."
1.0,The quality was trash and they looked awful. Don't bother.
1.0,I had to throw this belt away. It smelled very bad right out of the package.
1.0,"All of them with the exception of 1, broke within two weeks. Not the best in my honest opinion."
1.0,It is cheaply made and not the quality advertised
1.0,"Shoes started out great but within a week, some of the lights stopped working.  We reached out to the company who gave us a reset procedure which worked for about a day.  Then the shoes went back to not working properly.  The company sent us a replacement and had the same problem, broken within a day."
1.0,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!
1.0,Way too<br />Large
1.0,"really small, if you order make sure you go up a size or two.  The feel of the pants are outstanding, I just wish I could fit it."
1.0,Very disappointed ..not true to size at all!!
1.0,It lasted 6 minutes.  One twirl to show me how cute it was and it tore...big time.  Can you imagine how disappointed my granddaughter was that the entire skirt tore from the top?  And to return it they dare charge me!!!
1.0,Don’t buy from them I never received product
1.0,cheaply made the strap broke in to pieces.
1.0,poorly made. It doesn’t hang off your shoulder
1.0,This is the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.  I couldn't even pull the dress over my head or was so stiff. I would not recommend this dress to anyone.
1.0,The white stripe awful looking
1.0,Ordered a Large and it was so tiny like it was made for a child.
1.0,Can't fit in my nose to small
1.0,I mailed it back!
1.0,Only received 1 pair of glasses.  Blue lens gives off purple tint.
1.0,"This purchase is forever. I received the dress in September, four months ago. It didn’t fit, so I did all the convoluted steps to return it, saved my receipt, communicated with the seller multiple times, and I have yet to receive a refund"
1.0,These shorts are horrible.  They are so loose and are NOT flattering.
1.0,Extremely short and small.  The front of the shirt hit above my belly button! I even got a size bigger and it was still short and small.
1.0,Bad color. Worse material. Worst fabric cuts ever made... No one should ever wish these on their worst enemy.
1.0,Terrible.
1.0,A piece of cheap thin cloth material does not make a bomber jacket. Received and returned it the next day. I do not recommend this seller for bomber jacket.
1.0,"I had this sent as one of my granddaughter's birthday presents. When I saw the video of her in it, I was surprised the wrists and ankles were RED.  It clashes ridiculously with the pastel pink and purple of the rest of the entire pajamas. I would have never ordered this one if I knew it had ridiculous clashing red on it. Whoever decided red looked good with it should never be allowed to even dress themselves.  Obviously, I do not recommended and am actually mad because it was a birthday present I didn't choose for my granddaughter to open on her day."
1.0,Awful!!!!! Wouldn't stay up constantly having to re adjust them and seriously bad camel toe...they look and feel good upon appearance but when you wear them theybare horrible id give it -5 stars
1.0,"It’s very very cheaply made. Literally just fell apart at the silver band, can’t be put together again, total waste."
1.0,Zipper already broke
1.0,"I bought this for my ghost busters fanatic grand son, and he was very disappointed in it. The trap door was broken when it was delivered. I should've sent it back, but him being so worried about hurting feelings he told me not to. Now I wish I had, because he really doesn't like it, because it's broken!"
1.0,"When it first arrived it was Awesome, but last less then a month color faded all the way."
1.0,"The pants overall are pretty decent and fit well.  However, my issue is that the zipper did not last hardly at all!!  Did not need to wear the pants much until it got really cold out (I live in WI - so it can get very cold).  Within the first 2 weeks of me wearing these pants several times, I started having issues with the zipper.  After a month, the zipper pretty much stopped working all together and will not stay zipped.  I am not overweight nor did I stress the zipper somehow that would have ""broken"" it.  It just simply did not work very well.  Frustrating because I can no longer return since I am past the return / exchange time line."
1.0,This item is cheaply made
1.0,"Another reviewer suggested the sizes are random, and I am inclined to believe this. I'm a 10.5 and order XL per the chart in the product images, which should have put me on the larger end of this size. These things are huge.. would have fit 2-3 shoe sizes larger than my foot. Yet I see some reviews that suggest they run small. I suspect the sizes aren't sorted and they just threw whatever size in whatever package they wanted."
1.0,"glasses are too small, not providing sun protection at all"
1.0,Not good quality. Pasting was coming off when I received it. Not well assembled. They did refund me when I started the refund
1.0,The material is like panty material and very snug and see through. The stitching is inconsistent and wide.  It ships from China and is difficult to return with the seller. Proud to say Amazon is taking care of this though.
1.0,"Just about useless for anyone who has anything. Only holds 4 cards NOT 6. And one of those has to be your drivers license, because that little tray thing they show the condom in is just big enough for ONE condom or maybe some pills. So by the time you put your medical insurance car, your driver's license, and your employee identification in it, you have room for one credit card. Now the money clip is so tight you break your finger nails trying to put any amount of bills in there. And if you try to pull it too far you bend it and all bills just fall out rendering it useless. Now throw in the fact that it weight at least a half pound. It reminds me of a ladies little clutch purse that only hold a lipstick and you carry it for show only. I say spend some more and buy that titanium one that says it hold 12, then it MIGHT hold 6."
1.0,It's doesn't sit properly
1.0,"Being returned. The handle creates an unbalanced bag, it did not come with a shoulder strap. It was designed VERY poorly. Looks horrible and must return. Too ugly to look at and such glaring obvious flaws."
1.0,When I received these sweats for my bday in the mail I tried them on immediately and found that the entire seam going down the back side was completely open. Before even wearing them a single time I had to hand sew the back seam myself. I will NEVER purchase this item again.
1.0,"the on off switch is in the bottom, turning it off constantly. Watch rarely charges very poor engineering"
1.0,I don’t know who has a small head to fit this hat<br />But it doesn’t fit my sons head even unstrapped<br />It’s weirdly small for a hat
1.0,Waistband very uncomfortable and high rise
1.0,This was too big for the watch it was supposed to fit. It looked weird and it was a gift. Very disappointed.
1.0,"My grandaughter wore these shoes maybe 3 or 4 times and they started peeling, the flower came off one of the shoe, and the gold color peeled off."
1.0,Don't buy!!!! This is awful. The chain was much thicker than the pictured. Also this rusted the second time I wore it. DON'T BUY THIS.
1.0,Cheaply made... like products sold at 5 & dime stores.
1.0,"bulky and heavy. doesnt fit, too large. Not what i want in a pair of sunglasses. I bought these based off of their style and appearance."
1.0,Runs small. Very thin material.
1.0,"I bought this watch for my Dad for Father's day. I set the watch the night before and set it in the gift bag. When my Dad opened the gift bag about 12 hours later, the watch had stopped. We set the time again and  watched it. Every 10 seconds the second hand would stop. Then a short time later, it would move a few seconds and stop again. We reset the watch and set it on the table. We checked it about 1 hour later, and the watch had stopped about 20 min after setting.<br /><br />Beware, if you want to return the watch,  you must pay to ship it back for either a refund or replacement. I did contact the seller and they were kind enough to issue a refund without the return of the broken watch.<br /><br />I am sad that this watch didn't work, because my 94-year-old dad could easily see the clock face."
1.0,Too small too cheap
1.0,"I purchased these socks after watching the commercial. My son is 15 months old and I am sick of socks. However we got these for Christmas! My son was out of them within an hour. I had one orange sock on the floor and the other on the couch. At least I was able to find both of them and put them back together. Usually I can’t find both socks! So I suggest trying them for yourself, maybe my son is just a Houdini!!"
1.0,According to the picture I should have received 3. I don’t see anywhere that I will get just one.
1.0,"I really liked these plugs at first. I loved that they matched my skin and were overall effective at achieving the desired purpose, which was to disguise my ears for an interview. I noticed after about a week of wearing them, that something was terribly wrong. The lobes of my ears became incredibly inflamed and are in a great deal of pain. They are puffy and bloated and I can't even fit my old pair into them anymore. My first thought was that perhaps there is something in the material that I am allergic to. However, upon investigating this company states that the plugs are made out of ""surgical grade silicone"". I am not allergic to silicone nor have I ever had such a negative reaction to silicone in my life. Additionally, I figure that biologically if I were allergic to silicone that the problems would have been apparent almost immediately. But, as I stated, this reaction occurred after about a week of wear. I hate to write negative reviews, but there is something sketchy about the manufacturing of this product. If I could go back, I would have spent a little more on a quality piece rather than waste my money on this product."
1.0,I don’t like dumb thing ear  use them worsted thing<br />Have earmuffs
1.0,"This dress would have been perfect except it was so poorly cut along the hem and sleeves!  completely uneven all around, 2 photos included, but cannot show clearly enough how uneven it is. Also shredded lace on edges. Very poorly finished.  Seems like a child trimmed this dress"
1.0,Received without the chain. Will return it
1.0,Sizing WAY off. Material paper thin.
1.0,Was smaller than I thought and broke after one use!
1.0,"Wish I could give this negative stars. So angry. This was for my sons homecoming. It was stiff, too stiff and not comfortable for him. Plus, there is a pattern all over it that is stained tan in places. So ugly. Don't waste your money!!!!"
1.0,Too difficult to put on
1.0,Too small and the colors are not accurate. Very different from pictures in Amazon.
1.0,This is such a cute tote bag but the design was completely crooked and ruined the entire look. That’s not how the photo shows the material design. Just above the owl there are stripes and photo shows them completely straight. The tote I received has them halfway showing and at a weird angle. I just threw the tote away; I didn’t want it and wasn’t going to give it y=to my granddaughter looking like that. It was so cheap so I ordered another one today in hopes that with any luck I will get one that looks like the photo.
1.0,"Horrible, i just wear the glove but not for the purpose of using my phone."
1.0,"This is NOT hypoallergenic as advertised. If I had the power to remove these belts from Amazon so others with nickel allergies aren't injured by this product I would. I have a nickel allergy. If you have a nickel allergy, you know how painful the nickel rash products like this cause actually are."
1.0,I ordered my suze but it is too small and didn’t work.
1.0,"Beautiful watch that I absolutely loved, until just the third time I wore it.  The bezel cracked and started to fall off and the watch was never bumped or hit against anything and always kept in a case when not being wore.  I barely bumped it with my other hand and it broke.  Completely unacceptable."
1.0,I’ve had this for a couple weeks and the tip started to chip and then it broke away from the top.  Not good.
1.0,"Nearly impossible to get through my stretched piercing. It ends up irritating the hole. May work for others, but Not worth it to me."
1.0,This wand fell apart less than a week after we bought it. Don't buy this
1.0,"Don't bother ordering from ANY site on Amazon for clothing unless you know for CERTAIN it is made in USA.  These cheap shirts seem cute, but they arrive literally 1/2 the normal size. I wear a small, but ordered a medium - this won't even go over my head...it is what we would call an XXS...and it's just not worth it."
1.0,Waited 4 weeks for this top and received a single balloon instead! Buyer Beware!
1.0,Looks great on but will not inflate all the way
1.0,"The proportions of the the size of the rings are way off. Only one finger fitted and the other didn't, it was despicable. I gave it away to my little brother. PUT RING SIZES!!!!"
1.0,Pendant itself is very small and the item is titled and described deceivingly to say that you receive a pendant and necklace.  You only receive pendant and no necklace.  I would not recommend this seller or product.
1.0,Bracelets fell apart within two days🖕
1.0,The “black sheer” has that ugly blue undertone. They are soft and smooth but quality is sub par. Came out of the package with lines already on them (see pic of right out of the package)
1.0,Way too small for even the average arm
1.0,"Defective, even not symmetrical. One shoulder is larger than the other. See through. Very bad quality"
1.0,entirely toooo long. the rear end of the skeleton was at my knees
1.0,items are not cotton they are technical fibre 100%polyster microfibre
1.0,"Wasn’t impressed with the quality, so I returned it"
1.0,You will also hate these glasses. I ordered these and I immediately hated them. The lenses were distorted. It feels like looking through someone Else's prescription glasses. There awful!  There not even good for having as a second pair for emergencies. I'm definitely returning them. I like the frame style but what good are they if the lenses are distorted.
1.0,"I got a sapphire and an emerald ring to wear as a mother's ring, which were very pretty!  Lots of compliments!  However, after about a month of wearing them, there are at least 3 stones missing from each one.  Amazon said they would allow me to return with no problems.  So, I would recommend Bling birthstone rings for occasional wear, but not for everyday wear.  :(  Sad."
1.0,Sleeves are not as pictured...they are short!...as us the hemline... Looks nothing like pictures... don't waste your money.
1.0,Feels cheap - slightly cozy but cheap.  Better off spending just a little bit more for better name brand quality.
1.0,One of the pieces at the top right corner was missing. Returned.
1.0,Gives extreme camel toe
1.0,Very disappointed in this product. They both broke the first time I wore them.
1.0,Delivered with one lens falling out and the other cracked. No replacement offered.
1.0,"These were hilarious to play with. But that's it.<br /><br />Even with sport tape involved I couldn't get these to lift ANYTHING.<br />Anything more than a 36 B/C should probably stay away.<br /><br />Context: 5'9, a size 20, a 44D"
1.0,"Overpriced! And with all the pictures just confused people, I thought supposed come with 5, but only 1 came"
1.0,"Terrible quality!!! Do not order this! I ordered the red bulldozer set and the seams are not straight, the edges curl and the shirt appliqué is coming off after one wash!"
1.0,I don't like.  Very big.  No good for my neck
1.0,It was quite oversized and the fit was odd.
1.0,Zipper was broken. Had to have it fixed cost me as much as the jeans  did.
1.0,"Do not buy this for a boy unless you support your child wearing feminine colors. Looks boyish online, until you get it in person. Giving away all the bands to classmates due to the fact that they are not correct in color and style as pictured."
1.0,"I ordered this item last year, it was perfect, loved it. I lost it and bought another one. The one I reordered came defected. The pendant was discolored. Therefore, I asked for a replacement, it also came with two different colors. I returned both and requested a refund."
1.0,Poor quality but good customer service
1.0,"Terrible quality, not true to size, nothing like the picture."
1.0,"So sad about these.  They are thick but run small.  My 17 year old found them small and as an adult female, they are small on me.  The ear loops are different lengths on each side which makes the masks look crooked. The ear loops are not stretchy and very uncomfortable.  The nose bridge became useless after one wash (no drying)- it broke in the middle.  DO NOT purchase!"
1.0,"The cloths I ordered from them are all sized wrong, ordered a 3x it is like a small. All the other shirts were the same and made cheaply. Would never recommend to buy from them."
1.0,"When adjusting it, one of them broke, hope the other one doesn't break too"
1.0,Poor sewing and quality control on the waist button. Shorts are useless and cannot be worn with out the button.<br />Sounds petty but it fell off in the first week of wearing them and I don’t sew.<br />Can’t be worn.
1.0,The post that goes into your ear is so thick that it won't go into my ear.  So I can not use these earrings. One earring was delivered bent beyond use.
1.0,It would be  really great dress if it wasn’t completely see through and extremely thin and cheap looking
1.0,Looks very cheap and feels that way also. Do not recommend buying this purse.
1.0,Only 1-1/2 months old  leather separate.
1.0,Cute in the pic but they were such poor quality that the faux leather strap pulled out of the base of the shoe.  Not to mention the delivery was extremely late.
1.0,It dies not work. This is the second one I've gotten. Tired of messing with junk product. Dont waste your time or money
1.0,"Extremely elastic, but doesnt go back to original form. Pull it just a little and it will get discolored, stretched and warped permanently. Worthless."
1.0,Sizes run extremely small.  I am returning the ones I bought.
1.0,My son was very excited for this watch for Christmas but it broke within a month of wearing. Boo!
1.0,It's not the right size for my phone
1.0,"Cheap as i should have exepected.  Band broke in the first week, battery had to be replaced in the first 3 days."
1.0,Arrived with broken zipper.  Very cheap item for the price.
1.0,"I ordered a 60-pack of pink, expecting to receive 60 masks and the four little silicon storage bags. As you can see from the photos, I received 10 masks and nothing else."
1.0,"The watch bands feels cheap, and they got stuck on the watch."
1.0,Looks good but won’t keep time
1.0,I was really disappointed in this bathing suit it is entirely too small I ordered of 5x and still couldn't fit it it also took over a month to arrive
1.0,This hoodie run on the small side...it was even a little snug on me.
1.0,I ordered largest size for it to be big on me and it fit my petite medium daughter. And never got my refund for it either!!
1.0,Did not like it was not sanded probably got a splinter in the earlobe getting refund
1.0,Warning this product is smaller than listed and the quality is poor. I dont recommend this product due to poor/cheap quality and size.
1.0,These bibs were way to small. I gave to daughter who is. Peanut and they were to small firms he also.
1.0,Real bummer
1.0,Started to tear after 3 wears
1.0,Ripped first time my son wore it.
1.0,The band feel so uncomfortable. Not as advertised. DONT BUY
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture. Really disappointed.
1.0,One of the three shirts looks like it was previously worn or returned based on the crumpled packaging.  This was not disclosed and was represented as new.
1.0,Cute but teeny tiny.
1.0,Tela muy sencilla
1.0,"Read the reviews, saw all the pics--dress looked great on everyone but me. Wasn't a fan of the color--I purchased green and was hoping for more of an army green. This looked a little washed out and felt like i was wearing a thermal dress. Did not look good on me at all and I tried knotting multiple ways, even tried the back. Not a fan, but happy it worked out for everyone else, definitely a good price."
1.0,"Shirt was damaged, poor quality material, and did not look nor fit as expected."
1.0,Es un hiló no se ve cuando te la pones
1.0,The sizing is at least 3 times smaller than US sizing.  I have returned it.  You have to fill out a customs form and it was $28 to return.  Who knows if I will get my refund<br />Do not buy
1.0,For what you pay it is almost to much these lenses are cut almost to small. If they fit more snugly into the half jackets they would be an amazing buy and I would purchase more just to have around. I would send them back not worth my time to do all or that. Tried reaching out to company no response.
1.0,Estas mascaras  ya tardaron  demasiado Cruce más rápido la frontera de Estados Unidos no se lo recomiendo a nadie que compre de este producto
1.0,"I normally wear an extra large.  Ordered the L/XL.  I'm 5'6"" and it was so long it reached my knees.  Probably would have fit a 6'2"" man in the way it was shown in photo.  Don't know if it was labeled wrong or the size was just inconsistent.  Having to pay return postage, I wouldn't want to try another size."
1.0,Liked the look of open lace for summer ❤️
1.0,This is more the size of a medium or large suit using typical US standards. Look like a decent suit if it were properly sized.
1.0,"Doesn’t even cover my whole arms and you can still make out my tattoos. Which was the whole reason i got these. And the material is cheap, you can tell instantly."
1.0,Horrible. Do not buy.
1.0,I dont know whether it works or not. Only wear it twice. It does feel tight on my arms but hurt my neck at the same time.
1.0,"I wanted this dress so bad. Waited for it to arrive, and so ugly, runs extremely large, and this material is so horrific, it doesn't breathe and is very itchy material! It looked so adorable in pick, but it's def terrible quality."
1.0,"Nothing as described. Very cheap, fragile and flimsy."
1.0,Fabric is cheap and dress feels like it's going to get a hole quick!
1.0,That sneaker looked so lovable but the quality is so so. it came with a loose gluing in the bottom and was not easy to glued together.
1.0,"This is very cheap and for the price I would expect a better item, should lower the price to like 4$ will jot recommend!!"
1.0,These things are junk. While I wasn't expecting much I pulled the first one out and the top fell off in my hand.
1.0,Too big for size xl it fix like it 3x .material too heavy for summer dress and return policy it does not extend it . Very unhappy
1.0,The gloves did not heat up and I was very disappointed that the fingers stayed cool though the palms did warm up slightly —not sure if they were defective
1.0,Very thin material.  very cheap  disappointing
1.0,I wear an XL in all other shirts / jackets. This jacket was an XL and fit very tight. The material was also much thinner than I wanted.
1.0,The product is not real gold at all  and it got dark.  Very bad quality and i would never write a review but i had to with this product.
1.0,"Tough to get the gems to face forward. If the back was the same as the front, it wouldn't be an issue- but they are different, and it's hard to twist around to make sure the front part of the gem is facing forward."
1.0,They are very small and cheaply made.
1.0,style is not as pictured.
1.0,"Yuck. Crooked seams, raw edges, uneven stitching. Thank goodness I talked them into refunding me without shipping it back. I didn't want any other consumer to end up with this piece of junk. I threw it in the trash."
1.0,"$34 for a pair of cheaply, poor material made shorts?! Don’t order, you’ll be returning after you see what arrives inside your package."
1.0,really thin and poor quality
1.0,It came with the bottom charm backwards. Not even worth returning to get a new one
1.0,"The top band is off, so the stripe runs diagonal on the top. Will be returning."
1.0,Cheaply made. It looks like something you would get out of the bubble gum machine as a kid.
1.0,Looks like pic. I ordered an xl so it would be very loose.. NOT TRUE TO SIZE AT ALL!! Feels like it should fit a child. So disappointeded..  Zipper is not good quality. Keep looking... This is not a good choice.
1.0,This product broke easily
1.0,Fits 2 sizes too small and it is a crop top not a regular tshirt.
1.0,Ironic to advertise Christian jewelry with other colors and options containing obscenities.
1.0,"Cheap quality, poorly made"
1.0,Had a friend order some hot me a large to small. So I reorder and try can't get past the bottom of my hips. And this is a XXL don't what. Size chart they are using but it bot for American size. Says a 52 in but no way in the hell will they fit. I suggest you go to a pirate store directly. Hot.my shirt this way and I qear a XXL shirt. And the i got at a fair is a large. So no happy took 3 weeks and the tracking didn't show. Till I emailed and asked what the hell happened.
1.0,My daughter wore the bracelet for one day and it started to fall apart
1.0,Its hard to use as a sport bra when is missing the pads.
1.0,"Arm fell off one of glasses and after screwing it back in, it immediately fell off again."
1.0,One day of wearing these shoes in a carpeted environment.  Very poor quality.  Not happy at all
1.0,Much smaller than expected.<br />Smaller frames and lenses than RB wayfarers.?
1.0,Good for price for around the house.done
1.0,Grateful I could return these.
1.0,The pics associated with this particular model are misleading. While the style is same but to determine/visualize the fit on your face the pics should mention the basic lens size on the models. Unfortunately cannot even be returned!
1.0,Very cute but broke the next day
1.0,"Not sure if this was a shipping mistake, or if the skirt was advertised incorrectly. I ordered a midi skirt and ended up with a floor length skirt that drags the floor even when I'm wearing 5&#34; heels...and I'm 5'9&#34;! Nothing I can do with this thing, so it's getting returned. Sad, too, as I really loved the color!"
1.0,Sizes are really small
1.0,"Way too small for an XL & I'm not sure an XXL would fit (I've never worn anything XXL). Also, the button holes were not completely cut out, so I would have had to risk cutting the material to get them open enough to button it (which I couldn't do anyway). Note: the buttons on this are white plastic and make it look peculiar. I think they should have been black or pink. I returned the item."
1.0,"Very disappointed in the fit, I can't even wear it.  It's not eve close."
1.0,Returning for the second time.  1st one the screen print is backwards.  Ordered a replacement for that reason and returned.  2nd one is exactly the same.  Screen print is backwards!!
1.0,Color was way off
1.0,Washed once - shrunk so much it went from a dress to a shirt. Boo.
1.0,Very small cheap looking earings
1.0,Watch was to small
1.0,Elastic shredded within 10 wears. I have a lot of stretch bracelets - never saw one disintegrate this quickly.
1.0,"Super cheap looking, and runs big. I'd only use it for a Halloween costume"
1.0,Motor broke directly off of one axel after less than a week of use.
1.0,Fit really small
1.0,Thin material and not as pretty as picture
1.0,***Make sure you read the return policy*** I had to call Amazon to get a return label<br /><br />The dress did not fit as expected. It fit on the top appropriately but everything below was very baggy.
1.0,Everything... Is off about this dress.
1.0,"The sleeves were really tight, shirt was see through so I returned for refund."
1.0,Runs very small.not elastic at all.<br />It rip at the first try .is not a good product.
1.0,"These gloves fit perfectly and look great, and the e-finger tips work great with my phone. Unfortunately, however, they leave oily black smudges on everything I touch. When I got home from work on the first day I wore them, my wife thought I had a black eye because apparently I had rubbed my face in the car while wearing the gloves. Super disappointing. I expected better given the other reviews."
1.0,No me agrado enviaron otro artículo diferente a lo que pedí
1.0,Love the shirt but they run way small 😞
1.0,Can't really review because I received the wrong item.
1.0,Too small and ruined my Valentines outfit...
1.0,It’s bad
1.0,I ordered the green and it was perfect fit.  I ordered the blue and it's USED smells like detergent that really stinks.
1.0,Way tiny. Like a nose ring
1.0,Sooooo small!!
1.0,"Doesn't look ANYTHING like the pic. I picked this one because of the blue/green coloring. The one I got was sort of pink in some spots, colorless in others.  Really, really ugly."
1.0,"Love Cobb hill shoes, in general.  But these did not fit comfortably....am in process of sending back."
1.0,The quality is like that of a throw away Halloween costume.
1.0,Shirt was very short and the straps make it have an odd neckline
1.0,Does not work well at all. I end up not using them.
1.0,"Sorry, you can't see the dials in any but bright sunshine."
1.0,Fabric was thin and stitching wasn’t straight which made the striped section off.  Horrible quality!
1.0,I order the extra large and it still likes like it will fit my 8year old daughter. I don't know what size chart they used but definitely looks like a jr's M not a regular size XL
1.0,Made for short/petites
1.0,This product runs small. Because of the material there is no give. Also in hot muggy states the dress is hot and does not breath.
1.0,"They run short. I wear a size 8 pants, I ordered a large just to make sure they would be long enough (I have average leg length), they are too short, & fall down."
1.0,The quality of the fabric was very low. I ordered a large and they didnt even go over my calfs.
1.0,"The bathrobe is not 100% cotton. I'm not even sure if there is any cotton in it. It is very stretchy and doesn't feel like any cotton I have felt. Nice robe unless you need 100% cotton.  Very pretty, yet sad that it's not the 100% cotton item that I ordered."
1.0,I returned these. Very flimsy and cheap fabric. Did not fit well at all
1.0,"Again, this shirt was supposedly an extra large but was much too tight."
1.0,"After 1 use, pant tore.  The stiches are quite fragile.  Poor quality."
1.0,"Definitely cheap quality. Bought for bridesmaids and two broke same day just walking around, not pulled or caught on anything just dropped."
1.0,"Very flimsy, but I am a diyer will make the best of it, but would not purchase again, very very cheap"
1.0,"Not thigh high, barely comes up to my knees."
1.0,Earrings were broke when I received them
1.0,This was not the size it claimed to be. I bought a large and I wear a size 11 jeans and a medium in shirts. This was an extra small. But the tag said large. No way!
1.0,Was going to return but cancelled request it is not worth my time to print a return label and place in the mail. Item came defected the adhesive holding the &#34;Hello my name is Wendy&#34; is similar to children's stick on earrings and or press on nails.<br />The other key chain..... the name fell off that one as well. Never got the chance to place on my keys.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!<br />Do not waste your money!
1.0,Super cheaply made. Wasn't worth the money. The package was all tore up.
1.0,"Very cheap, the elastic strap at the top along the inside of the dress broke away from the fabric as soon as I put it on, I am 5'10 155 lbs and size 36 A bust so I'm not chesty by any means."
1.0,"I hated this dress...had no idea that it was a triangle sort of dress, not one with straight sides.  It cost so little I just threw it in the trash.  Ugly."
1.0,"Followed the instructions to the letter,  these absolutely will not stick to the lenses.<br />Don’t waste your money, just keep scrolling and find something else.<br />I was forced to give them 1 star or I couldn’t leave a review, but they don’t even deserve that much."
1.0,Keep rolling down very uncomfortable
1.0,size 14-16 is more like a 10-12 if your lucky. Buyer Beware.
1.0,"I am very, very unhappy with this purchase because the belt barely fits. I wear pretty much a size 33 in mens Jean's. So I know that when you purchase any belt you get a couple sizes bigger, and in this case I got the size 36 waist in this belt. It barely fits. I even went 3 sizes bigger than my actual waist size. The quality of the belt feels superior for the price, but honestly I wish I would have known that this belt runs way small then I would have gotten the size 38. So if you get this belt please make sure you get the belt like 4 sizes more than your actual waist line. I am really bummed out. Guess I will just take the loss unless this company will help me out in some way. I have never had to return anything that I have bought on Amazon because I make sure to not but nothing I dont want, but in this case I feel cheated because the belt was not the size it clearly says it is.."
1.0,I'm a size 16 and usually wear an extra large.  It did state they run small so I ordered a XXL. My 16 year old daughter wears 8 or 10 and they just fit her.
1.0,"Super thin material, lights don’t work."
1.0,"Within one use of putting on the belt, the leather immediately started coming off I tried to put the belt on.  Its super cute and I so m wish it would have held up, but its cheap and after one use, its already falling apart."
1.0,Not for iPhone 6/6+/7+. Contrary to claims in product description this is not big enough for these models.
1.0,It does not fit my 2×3 photo.
1.0,"From the picture I was expecting threaded plugs with some thickness, and decent flaring. Instead they are very thin, with 1mm or so flares and non-threaded. I guess that's what $10 gets you."
1.0,The size did not fit around my calves. I feel these boots are meant more for skinny or small women with small calves.
1.0,Terrible quality. Came apart before even wearing once. Don't waste your money
1.0,"shoes are very comfortable and breathable.  the only thing that I didn't like was that they are a running shoe, I ordered my first pair and within two weeks the seam at tops of toes separated so I sent them back and got a replacement pair the same thing happened within less then a week of having them. not only did the same thing happen but they also started coming apart as well as the inner side of both shoes."
1.0,Arrived broken. One of the pearls was rolling around in the box.
1.0,Color too light
1.0,The product came well packaged but it’s sizes ran very small - I couldn’t get it past my knees. The material was more like a rain jacket - I had to return.
1.0,This item broke within an hour of me putting only on and I would like a refund please.
1.0,"The material is cheap and thin. I ordered a small, it fits like a large. Looks more like a moo moo"
1.0,"Dress is cute but reeks of plastic, even after a dozen washes. Unwearable but unreturnable."
1.0,"La verdad no es lo q esperaba, muy ancha y no te da forma en la cintura y muy grande."
1.0,"This dress is okay...I didn’t mind the cream slip, but the dress was super dirty at the bottom and the sleeves were completely different sizes (one arm fit nicely, one arm had at least an 1 inch of excess fabric)."
1.0,Received wrong size and design.
1.0,They are made from cardboard and had half the feathers fallen off in the package
1.0,Did not fit any pair of earrings I needed them for. The whole was way too big to fit most post I have. I could NOT get them to lock. Read directions over and over and it would not work. Not sure why but not what I expected.
1.0,"This shirt fits nothing like the picture. It runs bigger in the bottom like a maternity shirt. I bought 2, 1 in black and one in white. When I went to return them they took the white one back and made me go home and print label and repackage! Done ordering from Amazon!"
1.0,I received baby shows
1.0,The neckline of the tank tops fall apart after a short period of time.
1.0,Very cheaply made. This is something you get from the dollar store. Very disappointed!
1.0,"I do not have them yet, so disappointed"
1.0,I ordered several of these for myself and friends. they failed to keep the sunglasses afloat. the glasses sank like a stone.
1.0,"Ridiculously shaped. Torso slim and length short but sleeves impracticably long and wide. Won't purchase again, much prefer Champion or Hanes."
1.0,The elastic was broke from the plastic clip
1.0,Returned. Size ran small and quality was just not there.
1.0,The body is small but the sleeves were made for a gorilla - no tag or label inside sweater or box.
1.0,The stone was not centered. This ring was a big disappointment
1.0,"The glasses are too small. These glasses are really made for a child,that's how small they are.<br />Given that the glasses are so small your really not seeing anything behind you and they made the<br />edges to see behind you so small that even if the glasses were adult size your still not going to see much.."
1.0,"REALLY wanted to love this. Needed to love this as my large set really pulls my shoulders back. However the concept is great, the fit is awful. I would say jump at least 3 sizes in the cup and 3 sizes in width and hope your puppies will fit. I jumped 2 sizes both ways and it still doesn't fit. So its an around the yard with 2 sets of puppies bra."
1.0,Sizes run very small.
1.0,The material is like a thick trash bag. The first time it tried to unbutton one of the snaps the button tore through the material. Not worth a penny.
1.0,Product is the equivalent of a gumball machine toy.
1.0,not big enough.
1.0,These are cheaply made earnings with felt circles glued to the back. The posts were bent and made with cheap metal. The are also very heavy.
1.0,"Looks much nicer in the pic. I wouldn't really call them winter boots, they are more like house slippers. very poorly made, I will be returning them."
1.0,"Fit was good but loose around the neck part … does not keep you warm at all .. I don’t like it , definitely not worth the price"
1.0,When washed one of the bra cups would move to the other side. There was no way to put it back. Utterly useless.
1.0,"Makeup didn't spread well nor did it cover well. There's only one makeup sponge in it but three colors...you do the math on how that works out. The tattoos are supposed to go on clean, dry skin...ummm so that image of them over makeup?? yeah it doesn't work. I was so frustrated with the makeup and tattoos I never got around to the eyelashes. Total waste of money."
1.0,Tooo small. Just gunna give it away. Shows my cellulite thro the fabric too. Yuck.
1.0,I ordered this in a medium because of the size chart and the size chart was clearly wrong because it’s huge. i usually wear a S-M. but this is like a large. and the color is a fuscia-magenta. not the lilac in the picture. very disappointed
1.0,"I really loved the design of this long sleeve shirt, but the cut is terrible.  It wasn’t marked what was front and back, so I would hold it up by the shoulder seams to “find the front”. Unfortunately, it fit as if I put it on backwards regardless which side was in front. The top is thick, but didn’t provide any warmth and the inside of the shirt was itchy. Overall, this tip was just an unpleasant experience b"
1.0,I ordered two Chevy logo T-shirts That I never took out the package because there were fading the Chevy logos on thin T-shirt unbelievably thin the Chevy logo is fading off upon arrival of the shipment so I need to return these as soon as possible now I am waiting for a return label.
1.0,"This has to be the crappiest mask I’ve ever bought.  I took it out of the plastic bag, went to put it on and the string just fell out of the fabric. I didn’t even pull it hard. For $8, I expect a mask that I can wear at least."
1.0,It's garbage. Broke first it second day. I know it's really cheap but it's also really crap. It'd probably be good for a younger girl.
1.0,Watch showed up broken and couldn’t be put back together. Save your money!
1.0,These masks won't protect you from Covid-19 because you can see through them. The mask is very very thin. Only good if you have another real mask inside and use this one outside. Not recommend.
1.0,"Too small, neckline not wide enough to adequately fit down on shoulders, not long enough (as shown in picture) and is not same shirt as what is advertised. Material is not even the same as what is shown."
1.0,Cheaply made!! Not worth the buy.
1.0,WASTE OF TIME. It didn't even stick to my phone so how could I expect it to protect my screen???
1.0,Item turned on for 2 seconds before it gave up
1.0,Neck fitting was not right .... Hands are way too long not as shown in the picture.
1.0,"Band was slightly too wide to fit my Samsung Gear Sport, I returned it."
1.0,"The dress fits as expected, although I sized up for a looser fit. The style is as advertised (I got the leopard print)  BUT the FABRIC IS VERY CHEAP!!!!! It’s the clingy polyester kind, very cheap!!!! I returned it the same day! Also note that the leopard dress advertised on the model has the print both on the outside and on the inside of the fabric. If you look at my picture, the dress I received is white on the inside. Hope that makes sense."
1.0,This dress was too small and almost see thru. I tried to return it to the seller and they offered to refund me $5.00. Watch out for these people. The dress also had several massive clumps of thread on each seam inside the dress that showed thru the fabric. It is a poorly made dress. I’ve had better dresses from Amazon. Sorry I didn’t want to give this company a star but I had to.
1.0,"I liked the material and color, but the XL I ordered wider and shorter than expected. Not very flattering."
1.0,Runs way smaller than a regular medium. Had to give to a 12 year old
1.0,Doesn't do what they claim.  Does not block out glare at night
1.0,Absolutely  horrible the dress in the picture is nothing like the dress received except it is white lace. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
1.0,"Why the ONGOING PROBLEM regarding the word ""cotton""? Over and over, one seller or another. I send the product straight back each time. Doesn't this waste the time of all involved? 😡"
1.0,the elastic bands break easily & only twenty five of the forty worked at all. most of these lasted through one use or broke during use. quantity over quality here
1.0,This dress does not fit as pictured.  I thought maybe it was just my 34DDD chest but gave the dress to a friend and it fits her the same.  The top of this dress is more the width of an apron - it only covers half your chest - way too much side boob is showing.
1.0,Not good quality. Started fading and i only wore it for one week.  Also the chain broke.
1.0,"It looked awful on me.  Size 4, 5'2, 110 lbs.  I'm a pear shape and it looked terrible on me.  The fit was very tight across the chest making me look even narrower around the top and rib cage.  I did not like the thick stretchy fabric either."
1.0,Leather broke by holes after just four months of use.
1.0,Fell apart !
1.0,"When I first came across these earrings, I thought they were super cute and funky. So I ordered them. They are way too small!! Not what I was expecting!!! And just my luck I got the, in white and black. Ugh!! Total waste."
1.0,Way larger than I expected.  Took it to my seamstress to have it taken in.
1.0,Not comfortable getting fit will go
1.0,This is a cheaply made scarf.  The fabric is so thin it wouldn’t keep you warm even inside.  I bought a similar scarf at a Cracker Barrel a couple of weeks prior to purchasing this one and not only was it a couple dollars less than this one but also it was much higher quality.  I am so disappointed because it was meant as a gift.  How embarrassing!
1.0,"My husband bought this hat for work because it had a high crest and well ventilated. That's how it's advertised! Not true! It came shipped about 1 inch high in a bag! It has a sloping crest to the top, and not a higher crest top! Cannot recommend it, and will try to give the hat away as it will cost more to ship it back!"
1.0,"Very long, thin material.  I returned it. Nothing like the picture, more like a sleep shirt."
1.0,"Although the idea is great, the quality recalled stunk- I guess that is why it was so cheap.  I wouldn't recommend buying this for anyone over the age of 12. The pearl was awkwardly shaped...not round or even oval and had no luster to it at all.<br /><br />Good for a very young girl to open as a surprise."
1.0,I fell in love when i first saw this item on amazon and It looks like a gold but i received silver and unfortunately i have to return the product...
1.0,The worst.  Ordered XL I’m usually a medium and I can’t even button these...
1.0,It looks cheap… didnt like it at all. M going to return it.
1.0,Cheap Quality
1.0,Shirts are NOT sized correctly. Shop elsewhere.
1.0,I got this for my friend for a party. The bracelet broke within seconds of putting it on for the first time; the chain detached from the ring. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,This item arrived missing some of the rings that hold the links together.  Would have been a pretty necklace if I could wear it.
1.0,It came in the mail with a broken clasp.
1.0,My daughter is a size 8. I ordered the size 8-10 and it fits my other daughter who is a size 6. So I ordered the next size up 12-14. It too doesn't fit her. These run very small and we have decided to go with a different brand.
1.0,Broke almost straight away. Not well made at all.
1.0,Did not do the job<br />Leaks
1.0,Poor quality. Not a flattering fit. Runs large. Good color.
1.0,"These things are terrible!!  How can they advertise ""easy on/off""!!!'  I ordered the large and they were not only<br />excessively  hard to get on but thought I was going to have to cut them off.  Do not buy these."
1.0,The heart came off the post and I swallowed it.
1.0,This is a not good quality product. I have too many issues with 2 weeks of use. Very dissatisfied with the quality.
1.0,For Galaxy Fit-E not Galaxy Fit.  There is a difference!!!
1.0,"I don't really know who these were made for but I ordered a large and an xl according to the reviews all saying they ran super small(I'm 5'2"" and 113lbs) the large didn't fit at all, the xl fit but was very tight in the bottom area which shouldn't be an issue since I literally am as flat as a pancake back there. The swimwear bra/top that comes with it is a joke, not even my 10yr old could fit in them the chest circumference is the size of a toddler's body lol returning both sizes to kohls"
1.0,No me gustan por que están muy estrechas del cuello
1.0,VERY BAD QUALITY!!! REALLY CHEAP PLASTIC!  LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD GET AT THE DOLLAR STORE!!!
1.0,The material is scratchy and uncomfortable. The compression on the waist is weird. The compression part only compressed half of the tummy and you’re left with a sucked in waist and your fupa bulding out from under. Considering I have a small frame and don’t have any lower belly issues these leggings definitely gave me a complex.
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered a small & they sent me a large. Fabric is cheap & you will need something under the dress because it's see through.
1.0,Worst product I’ve received. Do not waste your money on this!! I ordered a large and it may fit a little boy sized large. It’s horribly thin. I have hoodies that are thicker. Awful quality!
1.0,only 50% of the lights worked.  Very disappointed and would have returned them if I didn't need them so badly.
1.0,This dress runs extremely small . But it was a beautiful dress .
1.0,Do not buy this dress looks nothing like the picture
1.0,The shirt was sewn incorrectly and the model makes it look like a longer shirt but it isn't. It barely fit the length of my torso and Im not even tall or long.. I feel like I ordered off wish...
1.0,"Cheap, see through, costume, material"
1.0,Very small... Order at least a full size up... Maybe two.
1.0,Bracelet was literally half fallen apart when I received it. I have 4 other 4 ocean bracelets and all of them have a sealer wax on the thread. This one did not. Very disappointed! Especially for the price I paid and how long I had to wait to get it.
1.0,"This is the worst purchase I've made in a while. I wanted some cute silver ""safety pin"" earrings and they sent me real safety pins! They didn't even bother to take the point off them to make them real earrings and they sure as heck aren't silver.<br /><br />The hoops are broken too."
1.0,"Absolute garbage. Took the back off to install the enclosed battery only to find on e already installed. Now I can't get the back on no matter what I try. Seems to be an ok watch, just hope you never have to change the battery."
1.0,Bought the watch and it didn't run.  Set the time and none of the hands ever moved.  Very disappointed with this company that they would ship a non-working watch.
1.0,My original problem was the band. Eventually worked through that (with help from my daughter). Then it quit running during the night. It looked nice but sadly looks will only take you so far.
1.0,"Bad stitching, the shoulder strap was sewed on wrong"
1.0,"It turned my ankle green & broke the first day, really within a few hours of wearing it"
1.0,Buy Beware!  I tested these against polarized camera lenses and these glasses are NOT polarized at all.  They're just shaded.
1.0,"cheap material..paper thin, you can see through material. made for a little girl i think, size inacurate"
1.0,It feels as if you are wearing a long t-shirt
1.0,I like the size and the color of the stones
1.0,It's like a crappy spandex material
1.0,It had 3 knots in it very disappointed  very poor condition never buy anything from there again
1.0,Its too fake looking not cute at all.
1.0,"The smell that came out of the bag when I unpackaged this product was horrid.  Even after drowning it in perfume, the smell persisted and made my whole purse smell too.  I ended up having to throw it out because the garbage smell was too much."
1.0,"I'm a 16/18 ordered XXL and it is way too small, can't wear it at all"
1.0,Sit very high on waist :(
1.0,"Came in bubble mailer,  Lenses were popped out.  Huge pain to get back in and they continue to pop out. Spent more time fixing them than I did wearing them.  Need better packaging"
1.0,"Looked like the penguin from Batman, did not come up all the way stop mid section of my stomach."
1.0,Disappointed the band broke so soon after purchase.
1.0,"So I ordered a medium and I loved it, it just wasn't as loose as I wanted it, so I ordered a large thinking it would be more of a loose fit but when I received the large the sleeves were about and inch shorter than the medium, really?? I'm pretty annoyed but whatever I'll just stick with the medium"
1.0,The picture that shows when I purchase it is different from the actual base . That is not exactly what it shows . Now I have to carry it and load it to my car and return it . Very disappointing
1.0,Order 2 sizes up very small for xlarge
1.0,Do not buy. Too small and it was broken when i received it
1.0,"Not exactly what I was hoping for, disappointed!"
1.0,Waisted money
1.0,"I didn't expect much from a $7 necklace.  It's really cute.  I was hoping to get at least a few weeks out of it until I could buy a good necklace.  The first one arrived with the clasp broken.  It was sent back.  The second was fine the first day I wore it.  The second day I picked it up to put on,  but noticed the clasp was hanging from a link - broken."
1.0,Very cheap. Left my neck green right away. Chain is already turning colors after less than a week.
1.0,These run small. Keep that in mind if you order
1.0,To big for a normal  head
1.0,Way too small and doesn't open very wide.
1.0,"Not a great buy which was disappointing since it was my first time using one. It was a huge struggle trying to fill this thing especially if you have anything in the extra pocket, and it had a HUGE leak at the bottom. Most of my water dripped out all over the back of my legs so I only got to drink maybe a third of it. I’d suggest finding a better quality one there’s plenty of other options out there."
1.0,Fits small against 3 other Oakley jammer liners I own. Too thin. Too see through. Buy black a size bigger or keep your money. Not very stretchy
1.0,This bag was 4x smaller than what the picture depicted! I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,It was rusted when it arrived!
1.0,"muy malo , se rompe con facilidad , no lo recomiendo"
1.0,These gloves look nice however they are shorter than described and did not fit on the arm of a pleasantly full figured woman
1.0,"Waited for two of these masks for two months.  We tried to contact the company without success to find out where they were.  When they finally arrived, it was disappointing.  They are thin and fit too tight across the face.<br />Useless for any protection.  Too hot to wear for any length of time.  Sorry i ordered these."
1.0,The cut is weird and not as pictured.
1.0,Way too warm for summer.
1.0,Facial features are huge and outsized to the point of not being a recognizable face.
1.0,I was expecting a heart shaped cage and instead got a dolphin one. Also the necklace chain was broken there was no clasp to connect the ends of the necklace.
1.0,"I am disappointed, very poor quality, not so shine as on the picture, i can't use it for my project.<br />Lost money."
1.0,Love this coat. It’s long and really warm. But the ZIPPER IS BAD. The zipper rips on the bottom when wearing the coat. Also very had to unzip when it rips. Took me 30 min to try and unzip the zipper
1.0,Was not impressed. Material was thin and wasn’t for me
1.0,Did not as desired
1.0,"I received this just a week after ordering, which was awesome since I'm in California and it shipped from China. It fits true to size, I'm 5'1 110 pds. It is on the short side and rather boxy....but what bothered me most is I ordered the creme color and the fabric/color were nothing like the picture. It's more of a pink color and not a waffle weave. I attached a bunch of pics so others could see. Unfortunately I am returning as this color really washes me out... bummer since it's such a cute top. Update: the seller will not return unless I pay for shipping back...ridiculous since the item looks nothing like the pic. Really disappointed, what a waste of money!"
1.0,I bought this 1 week ago. She used it for 2 dance classes and she already has a huge hole in the crotch. Plus it wouldn’t stay on her it was too big. She is 10 and I have to get her a large women because she’s a big little girl. This jus wouldn’t stay on her. It kept falling down. There was no elastic to it to have it stay put up top.
1.0,The quality that was depicted was just not there for me
1.0,"I wanted this to workout so bad. It fit good, felt good, looked good.... Except for the hole! So disappointed."
1.0,"I liked the body suit. However one of the thigh seams didn't catch the material so there is a big hole in the side. Needed this quickly so I didn't want to chance a second one being substandard also. I found a similar sleeveless bodysuit and got that. Interesting is that it came in the exact same packaging (labeled ""SPEERISE""). It was made of slightly heavier material and seemed to be sewn better."
1.0,Had to give it to someone else....way to small...I order 2x large and fit everywhere but the sleeves and shoulders very small...never order again plus the color was way off ..it was royal blue and I ordered tuorquise
1.0,Lost one of them within the first hour . Not worth wasting money
1.0,Shocked by the fabric quality.  And the size chart is off
1.0,Stopped working right after I received it! Very disappointed.
1.0,This was absolutely  a horrible nightmare when I opened. I started crying it was so bad. This was my wedding dress for my wedding in two weeks since it was a second marriage we chose less fru fru. OMG horrible. The bra lining was un even. The lace was falling off in spots where it wasnt tacked all the way. The sleeves fell off shoulders and the lace up was backwards on parts. No way to fix it. Just recieved today and returning asap!!! As long as it took them this should have been a masterpiece.  So upset!!!
1.0,"they won't open, if i use a plier I can open it, can't put these on my ear"
1.0,This sweater looks nothing like the picture. Beware! The length I’d about half what the picture shows. Quite tacky
1.0,It broke in three pieces as soon as I took it out of the bag it was shipped in.
1.0,Makes head look swuare
1.0,One of the lenses  fell out after 2 days.
1.0,"Not at all what I expected, looked and fit nothing like picture. I wear a so 14 and this was not flowy. Material very thin, sewn poorly and had no give at all. Would require ironing back it went"
1.0,The print was nice but the cut and material were terrible. I ordered an XL based off of the size chart because I have a larger chest and I could hardly get it over my chest. The faux wrap was cut so high that one good gust of wind and everyone would’ve been able to see my bits. Definitely do not recommend.
1.0,Hideous. Bad buy
1.0,I was looking forward to getting them but no success. Glad they were inexpensive !!
1.0,The dress smell like cologne when I got it and it was ripped along the seam under the arm.. it was ill-fitting all around the waist and was scrunched up as if it wasn't stitched properly... I would say I was happy that it was only $15 but it wasn't even worth that.. one positive thing I could say is with me being tall the length of the dress works very well however it ripped it smelled and it was ill-fitted so the rest won't work
1.0,"Talla L es demasiado pequeña ...el primer guante utilizado se rompió, es muy débil el material"
1.0,"Did not realize how thin it was, then when I tried to return they gave me a hard time."
1.0,"These are of extremely low quality, and they are too small for anyone but a child to wear. I consider it difficult to be disappointed in socks, but these are awful."
1.0,No other word but cheap
1.0,"I wouldn't recommend if you have a 'full shaped' body.  In other words, if you have a skinny body type and small busted then maybe it will fit.  I'm a 34D cup and  toned body because I work out a lot so this is not for me."
1.0,Regular cotton not linen looks chip
1.0,No elasticity. Ruined after one time use. Falls off the knee. Very disappointed
1.0,First of all this just isn't for heavy top gals like me. Im not sure if the side boob action mean I got it to big or to small but this thing is all wrong. The pads looks like nipples underneath. And this does NOT hold these fun bags in place at alllll. My girls was still everywhere. So I guess this was a miss for me. Imma give it to my 11 year old.
1.0,the material is bad slightest bump or scratch it will just start peeling. But other than that it’s cute and roomy
1.0,I'm somehow disappointed:(
1.0,"I returned this dress.  The dress was advertised as a tshirt dress, but it was a thick polyester fabric with no stretch.  I ordered a tie dye style and the tie dye was printed on the fabric.  It also ran small.  Not for busty girls."
1.0,Poor fell apart
1.0,Disappointed not as defined as the picture shows. The stones are barely visible and very tiny.
1.0,Its not the right size that had been sent to me from the beginning..now I have to find some where to print my label in order to get it back to you when I didn't go through all that or put you through anything in order to obtain the boot...
1.0,"Don't be fooled by the images the band isn't golden brown it's simply brown. When I first opened it I thought there was a mistake but the label does say golden brown even though it's just Brown.<br /><br />My current band was golden brown but after five years of use has turned dark brown, my original band is still lighter than the band they sent me.<br /><br />See image."
1.0,This bra was poorly made.  This has no support.  I returned it.
1.0,"Wrong hat arrived, could not return."
1.0,It’s a kids hat
1.0,"Bought a hat years ago and my husband loved it, so much so we needed to replace it. Ordered it from another seller and what came was not the same as what he had before or more importantly, NOT the same as pictured on Amazon. The hat is very nice, nothing is wrong with it, it's just not the same as whats in the photos. Very minor differences in the design but the biggest issue is that the cut of the hat was not low profile, which we wanted. Very frustrating and really too bad as the original design is much nicer."
1.0,Things busted after 2 weeks
1.0,Horrible!!  Not even close to picture!  Certainly wish I would have seen all reviews before ordering as it appears we all got the same tiny shirt vs. Long cute sweater in the picture.
1.0,broke within a week
1.0,Looked cheap... battery died day after I gave to my nursing school daughter. Piece of junk!
1.0,Cheap quality broke easily
1.0,"The fabric is super cheap looking, and the stripes are way smaller than they look in the photo. I felt like I was wearing a halloween costume. Sent them back..."
1.0,the bar is much too small for my 1 year old. waste of money.
1.0,More of a clown red. So cheap looking
1.0,I bought these for a Christmas present but it didn’t work on the Fitbit
1.0,Got holes in them.  Not good quality
1.0,"What I received is nothing like what was pictured. Thin, sheer, cheap, and you can see the bra cups clear as day."
1.0,This ring does not look like silver looks tarnished ugly in every way
1.0,"Original review: The straps are really thin on this bag. Also the cell phone pocket is too tight for a standard phone and when I've tried using it, I've been afraid it's going to rip. It's good for the price I guess but still would've liked a little higher quality.<br /><br />Update: On August 13th, after only 4 months of use, the strap completely broke off. Definitely DO NOT recommend if you want something to last for a reasonable amount of time."
1.0,This shirt is way way way to small
1.0,"Pretty much see through, flimsy, nylony material. Feels like it would be sweaty and stretch out instantly. Unfortunately returning.<br />True to size, though!"
1.0,"Short dress, very weird length. Slits up the side and very low cut"
1.0,This does not fit like the picture shows
1.0,I didn't even try the dress on because it was the wrong pattern.
1.0,"The pullover was nice quality and as described. However, it didn’t fit. The seller charges $5.98 from your return right from the top. Then instead of a QR code you can read from your cell like all yother Amazon  returns, they require you to print the label and re-package (again an additional cost).<br />Between returning two of these, it cost me an additional $20 out of pocket.<br />Also, I am a Prime member. I will make it a point to never purchase from this seller again."
1.0,Not comfortable shoes. At all and Hard sole and leather. Didn’t expect this from Guess
1.0,Waste of money!! Mask arrived without any head support. If you’re comfortable with holding mask against your face cool .. but it wasn’t for me! What a waste!!!
1.0,"I received this item Saturday and as soon as I tried to place it over my wrist that same day, the band broke and beads flew everywhere. I have purchased other beads from sites on Amazon and never had this occur. I requested for a refund the same day. To bad because I really liked the look of it."
1.0,Item looks so cheap and does not look like the picture. The seams are surged and not folded as pictured.
1.0,"I didn't think such a simple sewn concept could be too small, but indeed. My head and arm could not get through the same hole. 🤷🏾‍♀️"
1.0,Way too small! You need two sizes up and the size chart is inaccurate
1.0,I had to returned the product due to won't stay on my nose
1.0,So so off! I have been eyeing this romper for some time now and finally bought it with a night out in mind... I’m a size 6 and ordered a Large - it was still riding up the crotch and butt- but large on sides of chest (and I have a larger chest). The material was so cheap and the fit was so wrong!!
1.0,These shoes are so awsome..my 4 year old And 10 year old loved them. I ordered two pair from different companies and within a month the straps have come off Nd one shoe doesnt light anymore. Also the charging port rubbed on my 4 year olds ankle inside the shoe. Very cheaply made. Also this was not my childs only pair of shoes so they were not over used.
1.0,Item came defected. Front left lens had a crack where the black covering split. Very disappointed. This was suppose to be a present for graduation. Wtf? Too much trouble to send back for replacement. Never buying from them again!
1.0,More cropped than I expected and the tag is cut off!
1.0,"These were cheap and super disappointing. The thumb pocket literally went only halfway up the whole thumb outer part. When my thumb didn't go in, I took them off and tried to push the liner further into the outer, and it ripped a giant hole! Don't waste your time."
1.0,"These were not true to advertised size, they were not 1.5"" high, but about 1/4-5/16"" shorter.  You would think these people would get the dimensions correctly listed for their products. Construction seemed ok, I would order again if I could get the right size, but now I don't know what to believe."
1.0,It says it was sterling silver but it was not it tarnished almost immediately telling me it's not sterling silver was not happy with the quality of the product at all.
1.0,"There is no place to contact seller to complain, This necklace looks nothing like the picture. Piece of crap"
1.0,"The items sizing is incorrect. I received a large that barely fits over my hips. It’s fits more like a small. I’m 5’8, 168"
1.0,Different watch then what was on the picture! Feels cheap compared to the pics.
1.0,Impossible to put on. You melt wax to get the tooth to stick.
1.0,"I have no reason to write anything....since I didn't get the glasses! Unfortunatelly, there was no one to receive the package and I just noticed after a while- that's why I didn't make a complain!"
1.0,Only worn it one and possibly will never again. It’s huge for my head and the adjustable strap at the back doesn’t stay at the size I adjust it to.
1.0,Was supposed to be a 5 pack and was short one. It's the principle of it.
1.0,Initiated return as soon as I opened the bag. I could make this tank myself and it would come out better. It’s literally just a cheap t-shirt that they cut with scissors into a tank top. For this price you can buy a 4 pack of t-shirts And cut them yourself and have 4 tanks that will be IDENTICAL to this product. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,broke in the first day
1.0,"I love cuff watches and I love this one.  I bought it Feb. 2 and today, April 14, one of the cuffs fell off.  I don't think I can fix it.  Extremely disappointed"
1.0,"Horrible. There is NO WAY this was even close to a large, let alone an extra large. I can hardly fit into it. I am very very disappointed. I don't even want to give one star."
1.0,Returned. I thought I was getting xs and the fit was not even a small.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6c9177cc192855271bfaa8ab44183981]] I ordered my regular size because all the reviews say it runs big and I wanted that. This is so small! Like the sleeves dont cover my wrists! I went to check if I got the right size and the tag is visibly cut off of the jacket. The item came in plastic bag with no tags indicating it was new. For all I know this could have been used. Had it been the size I wanted I would keep it but I am so disappointed. Not worth the price for the sketchy practices...
1.0,"Back straps are too long so it constantly rides up and gets tangled in the back, bust was way too large"
1.0,"My ear is now black where the jewelry touched, stainless steel doesn't do that. The earring itself has green starting to show in the crevices. I think it's a cheaply made low grade alloy."
1.0,Product runs like 2 sizes small
1.0,The packaging was not good both earrings posts were broke off.
1.0,They are women sizes that are advertised. The company does not know the difference when asking them.
1.0,This shirt was a small and it was huge. If you wear are large order a small.
1.0,The size was way off ..
1.0,Broke before wearing a week. Poor quality and disappointing
1.0,The size is a mess!
1.0,Very cheap & itchy
1.0,This ring broke while wearing it.
1.0,Have me a super bad rash around my wrist after only 10 minutes of wearing but it’s really pretty!
1.0,It is not anti fog. I was actually excited to get it but very disappointed once received. I'll never purchase this product again.
1.0,"Weird cut, very uncomfortable."
1.0,Ring broke after only one use. Will be returning and I hope I get my money back.
1.0,Bought XXL and it fits like a M-L
1.0,"looks awesome until you wear it, the straps pull out of the clasp that holds them in, it is fixable and for the price I guess I shouldnt have expected much more."
1.0,"I dislike the grips on these sunglasses.  Every time you use these sunglasses,  you need to clean your glasses. The silicon pads mar the glasses.  I would not recommend these sunglasses."
1.0,Used the reviews from other buyers; who indicated suit fit small.  So I bought a size larger; which did fit except for the non-adjustable straps.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable and I did not like the appearance once I looked down onto my feet. The shoes made my feet look very wide.  I’m an Eady Spirit and Clark’s shoe fan. I thought all of the good reviews meant I would feel comfortable in these shoes, but NO!  My Easy Spirit shoes always feel 100% great when I put them on, even the first time."
1.0,"Not wat i expected, so disappointed."
1.0,"Terrible.  First, it's not real leather.  Second, the hat is held together by an ugly brown shoelace looking like string.  Third,  it's extremely flimsy.  Complete waste of money."
1.0,"These sleeves were impossible. I was unable to pull the medium over my foot. When I tried to put the xl on, my toes kept catching on the threads inside."
1.0,"WAY too small. I ordered an XL and it should have been loose but instead it was very, very tight. Would not recommend unless you wear much smaller sizes."
1.0,This is so cheap and fake looking. Seams like something out of a kids 50 cents machine.
1.0,No me agrado mala calidad de la tela
1.0,no tengo ni dos meses usandolo y ya se rompio
1.0,This runs super small.
1.0,The color of these shorts are not as pictured. They were way too gray.
1.0,It didn't last very long. Fell apart.
1.0,Cute shirt but based on reviews I ordered 2 sizes up and still WAY to small!
1.0,These shoes were worn twice. Once on Christmas Eve and the second time on December 26 to church. Our grandson was playing on the church playground. The black material is too thin for young children. He is six years old. The damage went all the way to the fabric. If the surface is going to be that thin the shoes need to have a toe support. The fit and style of the shoe were fine the quality of the material is why I’m only giving a one star rating
1.0,"I originally purchased this for my husband and gave it a good review.  I received this the first part of July, and it has already broken.  The stem popped out, and you can't fix that.  For this reason, I recommend you don't you purchase this piece of junk."
1.0,This product I didn't care for at all. Looks like a wet creature's fur. Get a more expensive one for satisfaction.
1.0,"The color was accurate. However, this dress looks like the rags Cinderella wore before she met her fairy Godmother!! Cheap, and part of the embroidery looking material on the top was already falling off when my daughter tried it on. The waist was way up high, not at natural waist. We were shocked that the top was completely see-through. Very disappointed. We don’t have time to order another dress, and this dress is unacceptable."
1.0,Love the looks... but it just stopped working. Just like that!
1.0,The purse was cheaply made and very flimsy. I returned it.
1.0,"What a rip off! The product is advertised as being a set. It does not give a choice of buying the set or just the bracelet. Very misleading! The piece is nice, a little heavy, but $57.00 for stainless for one piece! Ridiculous! Someone else got misled as well and the sellers response was that they offer a set as well as just the bracelet. No they don’t! Considering that I bought it mainly for the ring, I feel this is a bait and switch scam."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money.  Awful fit, cheap fabric, and it somehow manages to be uncomfortable, ungainly, and unflattering all at the same time.  And with no returns, you might as well just toss your money out of the window."
1.0,Not the material I expected seems cheap
1.0,Not a razor back<br />Cheaply made and came in over a month late. I fear washing it because the material is so cheap. I feel it will peel off.  The shirt is super thin as well. Not as pictured.
1.0,The item did not survive postage.  The stone was chipped and had fallen out of its setting.
1.0,I bought the three pack and the compression quality was great. These are absolutely terrible and offer no support whatsoever.
1.0,"Cool looking but the 3m tape did not stick, not happy!"
1.0,"I got a large. And it was kinda loose around the chest area (I'm a bra size 34B for reference) but everything else fit fine (5'3"" at 155lbs).<br /><br />I really liked this dress but gave it ONE STAR because I wore it once. Washed it once and the zipper on the side is already broken. Honestly, not worth the price. Perhaps I just got a bad product? Anyway, I still wouldn't risk buying another one just to see if that's the case."
1.0,Not as pictured. Shield doesn’t attach to hat. There’s a string to tie in back.<br />Extreme chemical smell. I doubt I could wear this to grocery shop without being overcome by fumes. I would send it back but it’s too much of a hassle right now.
1.0,The smallest 3x ever seen
1.0,Got it broken.
1.0,"First I'd like to say I already own a pair of 90 degree leggings for workouts and running! Very pleased with they initial product, so much so I wore them in my first 5k so I was excited to purchase my secondo pair for my next 5k. However, what I just received is a far cry from what my first purchase experience had been.  The material is almost completely see through... I mean just running my hand along the inside I can see my fingernails through the cloth.  To be clear I ordered the same size large as the first time,  difference being color and style i.e., long vs. capri. I think it's because of the color pattern as well,  seemingly rich and vibrant hues are lost when the pants are barely stretched.  I'm hoping this is a malfunction and I will be selecting another color to replace these because my first pair have been such great quality.  I'll keep you posted on how that works out!"
1.0,"we are still waiting ,still waiting ,still waiting for a postage paid return slip to mail these stompeez back ,when they came they came in a plastic bag and a shipping box ,no size at all anywhere on the bag or on the slippers so when we tried them on our son his toes didnt even go in the slipper ,they are a small when I had ordered a medium which is an 11.0 to a 4 my son wears a 13 so ya know how small they are ,please send my slip so I can return these.well its been 5 dayas and no return paid label I am selling the ones I got that was to small and buying from a local store and never buying from this comany again.NOT HAPPY CAMPER IF I COULD RATE STOMPEEZ A -0  I WOULD"
1.0,Hat was torn at the brim Way too small. You get what you pay for
1.0,This item is a lovely dress. I bought this  dress a size up from my size and it  still did not fit right. You will have to order 2 sizes up.
1.0,The decal is not centered and is arrived bleeding into the white. Seems like this echos the other reviews.
1.0,"Bracelet was advertised as 7.5"" but is an inch shorter and does not fit."
1.0,"I ordered size 9 but it feels like size 11. Wayy too big! I wont order again, sorry!"
1.0,Horrible. Too small. And horrible printing.
1.0,not fit in wrist....
1.0,"I hate leaving a negative review, but these are so poorly sized that I have to speak out.  I read the reviews and questions before buying and ordered a size larger based on what I read.  My son is 6'2&#34; and the only way these would ever fit him would be as capris.  Either that or they shipped me boys size vs. mens.  If you're taller than 5'8&#34;, look elsewhere.<br /><br />On a plus, they seemed very well made and my son would have loved them."
1.0,These glasses were no good! They were so distorted I couldn't use them! Wasted my money- wrote a negative review and have NOT heard back from them!
1.0,Runs very small and I ordered An XL
1.0,As soon as I received I cleaned and put a stud in. The next day I woke up and the “gem” in it had fallen out. I tried another and before the week was up it had lost its piece too. The hoops are too large and hang oddly from my nose.
1.0,The only thing I disliked about this problem is that they send you ugly jewelry that isn't pictured
1.0,"It just snapped while I was playing with my daughter at the park. Ruined my time because my pants wouldn’t stay up. Very cheap design, didn’t even use it 3 times."
1.0,"It was extremely big! I ordered them for my daughter, and they were too big. I tried them on, and they fit me big too!"
1.0,Impossible to use!!!  Not enough space to open clasps and connect necklaces!!!  Wasted money!!!
1.0,I wear a XS/S and so I ordered the S/M and I barely got them on. There's really no stretch to them so they look too tight. The ankles are ridiculously TIGHT!!! Oh and the crotch kind of hangs! Nothing good about these. Dont bother!
1.0,Does not fit your boobs and the straps were too big.
1.0,The strap on the shirt broke almost immediately.  Won't buy again.
1.0,I thought the pants would be full length and they are Caprice
1.0,"Was not a bathrobe @ all, it was really thin and short."
1.0,Material is very thin and the shirt runs small. Not very flattering on me so I returned it.
1.0,Dress came in 3 days late. After taking it out of the box I noticed it had a stain on it and it looked like it was stretched out. Returned it immediately. Very disappointed.
1.0,Not made very well. From pocket sewn crooked. Very small.
1.0,Used item<br />Dusty
1.0,"Arrived over 20 days than what it estimated. And it's really small, like it does not cover your face. Not like the picture at all. I've never left a review for anything before but this sucked so bad that I had to."
1.0,"Scratched lens first day of owning, water easily gets trapped between watch face and screen cover if submerged. Very cheap plastic housing, like the dollar store toys you’d buy your children. Don’t waste your money on this, buy a GOOD screen protector instead."
1.0,"I ordered these for my Mom whose fastener ring had broken off her Garmin Vivoactive HR. The colors were lovely, but the bands were about twice as large as they needed to be. I had to send them back. We found others that did work well."
1.0,Wow this product is garbage. It’s cheap material. Looks nothing like the picture and it feels like cardboard. Fabric doesn’t breathe. Grossly misrepresented and misleading. Do not buy.
1.0,Very thin. Well not keep you warm. And  looks nothing like the pic
1.0,Very disappointed. Holes (like pulled apart from each other) everywhere along the seam like it was worn many times by someone already 😡😡 I will order another one because I really love this dress. Hopefully they send me a brand new dress this time.
1.0,Material is no stretch and dress was made for a child
1.0,"I’ve had this for about a month. I ride whenever the weather permits, however; this is close to needing replacement. The Velcro is coming apart and sticking is coming out. There’s parts of the Velcro that won’t even attach any long. All of this after a month. Yea, not durable at all and I don’t wear it on every ride."
1.0,It was dead on arrival.<br />I'll look into another demagnetizer.
1.0,"I love the style of this suit, however, there is no support in the chest area so I wouldn’t advise taking the halter strap off.  Pretty disappointed...I bought 2 colors."
1.0,"I ordered this dress because it looked great on the model. When I received it, the left side leg cut out was way HIGHER that the right one! The material was okay, I think I could ordered a xs instead of small. I am 126 pounds and 5’7 tall..."
1.0,"I can't even begin to stress how much I hate these. There are several options out there with the 2 seam crotch, and I would recommend against all of them. This pair has the '2 seam' up the front AND back causing these leggings to not even go up all of the way, comfortably. Let's note that I'm a whopping 5'2. Also, while I'm larger than I want to be right now (165#), my size isn't crazy big, and I feel like I'm going to bust through the thighs on these. Putting them on is like putting on nylons, which, whatever. But they're so uncomfortable that I wouldn't even wear them. Sad"
1.0,This is like a shirt with a picture on it. There are no other textures. It is NOT a costume. Very disappointing and mis leading. ON PURPOSE
1.0,"Bought this on a whim.  Saw another Amazon customer wearing it and it looked great on him.  Just didn't do much for me.  The waist size was fine, I'm a medium and got the same."
1.0,Chain broke first week wearing
1.0,"HORRIBLE!! This company is a scam! Before ordering anything from an  Amazon seller, read the reviews first, my own mistake.  The dress look like it was made in a chop shop. Not the same color, 100% poylester, not as advertised, tight sleeves with cheap stetching. This company is using other company's pics, and selling you product that look like it came from Wish. I returned it immediately and received an amazon credit."
1.0,Not flattering at all. They also have a smell that doesn’t come out.
1.0,"Bought my son the light blue one, that photo does NOT represent the product. The shirt is advertised as “denim”, the photo makes it seem like it’s denim and it is not. (Although it is true to size), it is an extremely cheap material with horrible yellow stitching. I will be returning if possible."
1.0,"I have been searching for a replacement liner for my favorite shopping bags, but this is flimsier than the original liners I purchased some years ago. Better than nothing I guess but I wouldn’t buy again"
1.0,Don’t fit rights
1.0,"At least size up 3 sizes. My nanny may be a large. I ordered a 2x so it would be loose, it’s so tight it won’t even snap with her  prosthetic in it. Her cup size is a b if that says how small they run."
1.0,To bad quality for the price
1.0,After 2 weeks the snaps gave out. Highly disappointed. They look nice but they're cheaply made.
1.0,"Terrible fabric, neck opening not even big enough for my head to fit through and no stretch. Had to return. Would not recommend"
1.0,"Low quality, it smells like the low quality plastic."
1.0,did not zio up
1.0,I ordered this for my daughter for her 11 birthday she like it but its very cheaply made snd feels very plasticity. She like it so I didn’t return it
1.0,We bought for yard decorations....but they didn't last a week...very cheaply made...but you get what you pay for
1.0,I just expected it to fit a normal size adult - not even close. And quality is horrible
1.0,This hat claims to be for adults but I couldn't get the thing to fit on my head. The only way I could was with the snapback completely undone. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to wearing this hat.
1.0,Not even close to the picture.
1.0,"These joggers were comfy and true to size according to my daughter, but the seam in the inner thigh tore open within the first wear. My child had to wear her jacket tied around her waist in the front at school because there was a huge gaping hole in the inner thigh. They ended up straight in the trash. Waste of my money."
1.0,"Maybe it doesn't good for my eyes, I think. Very poor in quality."
1.0,The fabric was of cheap material and was returned to the seller.
1.0,"Not at all true to size, def size up one or two then maybe I could post a decent review on it"
1.0,"I got the small and the flap of material that folds over the hips is way too big, and I have big hips. The skirt would not stay on properly with that loose flap."
1.0,I bought these as a birthday present for my daughter. She had them on for a total of 10 minutes and the strap snapped. Would not reccomend.
1.0,These glasses are ridiculous. They are H.U.G.E. and they look stupid. This is why sellers need to put a picture of glasses on a model or mannequin or something.
1.0,A total waste of money.  The socks kept moving while walking so the slip pads end up on the top of your feet.  That is not good.
1.0,These socks are way too thin. After just one wear they had a hole in them.
1.0,"Look at the photo, see the poor quality yourself"
1.0,Does March the pictures on product description
1.0,Doesn't stay in place. Won't buy again.
1.0,Too small does not even cover any of the boobs
1.0,Bought these glove last night paid for overnight because I needed them for work but they were damage stitching is unraveling.
1.0,"Poor quality, very cheap.  The chain broke the first time my wife wore it."
1.0,"They are very pretty; they feel great when you put them on, but they would not stay on my heels. They bunched up under my foot in the shoe."
1.0,Pants too ripped
1.0,So thin material with no stretch at all. Kinda smallish
1.0,"The posts are cheap metal allow and not stainless steal as they claim. I bought these because my ears are sensitive to almost everything but stainless steal. I wore them once and had an immediate reaction (swelling, discomfort, pain and plasma secretions). One of the posts had tarnished, within an hour of wearing it!! So beware, these are not for sensitive ears."
1.0,"The clasps are so small on the beaded lanyard that I can't use it with any of the 6 masks that I have.  They also sent a lanyard of white elastic that had a different  clasp, so I improvised and attached that clasp to make the bead lanyard work"
1.0,horrible disastrous
1.0,"My coat came with absolutely no lining.<br />I haven’t even worn it yet because of the no lining. I’ve been putting off sending it back bc I thought I would get it lined. However, read the discription again to find that this coat should have a lining. Pretty irritated."
1.0,👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
1.0,The strap on this broke two days after I opened the package.  I had ordered a month before I planned on taking it with me on a vacation so I could not return because by the time I used it the window for a return had expired.  For the two days that I was able to use it the product was exactly what I needed for a small bag for traveling.  Just too bad the quality was so poor.
1.0,Completely see through. Pornographically see through.
1.0,It’s a lot cheaper (in quality) in person and there’s a price tag left on it that’s $45 less than the price I bought it here for.
1.0,Shapeless
1.0,"I was looking for a dainty chain, and that's what this is, but it's also cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It broke the first time I wore it."
1.0,Falls out. Not that absorbent
1.0,I wear my rings day in and out.  Sterling silver is my favorite because it doesn't bend as much.  This ring my friends is not 925 Sterling Silver.  Silver coating over brass perhaps.  Do not buy this ring it's a joke!
1.0,The title sums it up. I opened the double packaging to a smell of mildewed jeans. The worst smell ever.
1.0,I thought these was cotton. They are not.
1.0,What the *!$%* kind of pants are these? Horrible laughable hideous style of pants
1.0,I did not receive any of the straight posts at all as I was expecting and as they advertised. The 3/4 hoops just look weird as well.
1.0,Slips off at night
1.0,Belt looks great but in less than 3 months the outer layer of the belt has starting peeling.  This happened to both belts that I purchased.
1.0,I ordered a small because I’m quite tiny and these were huge! Way to long on the legs they don’t fit like real leggings it’s like putting on stockings. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I bought this product for a dancer’s bun. I’ve always used Jac-O-Net hair nets and they are perfect for my purpose. This ultra invisible one, however does NOT hold a tight dancer’s bun. The net basically ripped before I could even get it around my daughters bun. It also kept slipping off the bun as I tried to get it around. I ended up with a bunch of these that I couldn’t return because the return window has passed. I only bought these because the regular one was not available in dark brown. Stay away from the ultra invisible!"
1.0,Ripped putting it on. Won’t buy again. Cheap
1.0,I read tons of reviews that loved this dress. I was so excited...until I got the dress. It it stretchy but white and completely see through when it is stretched. The stitching is terrible and the fabric is already fraying at seams. I’m so sad.
1.0,"We purchased this by mistake. We were trying to buy an elf on the shelf and accidentally ordered a ""couture dress"" for the elf. At a price point of $33 it would have never occurred to me that we were buying a teeny tiny dress.<br /><br />We bought a fabric elf on the shelf that cannot even wear this thing. The title says ""dress"" but all photos show a full elf and the product description doesn't specify. I wouldn't have ever spent this much money on a tiny fancy dress unless it was for a specialty collectors item that would hold that value."
1.0,Dress was very ill fitting. Had no shape to it.
1.0,"Neck line was cut to small, couldn't even button it."
1.0,Got a different one and it looks cheap<br />Don't buy
1.0,"I received this watch and the first thing that came to mind was that it looked cheap, and the color was off."
1.0,"As some reviews have mentioned, it did not lay correctly on me and it was a little tight in the arms.  Probably best suited for someone who is petite."
1.0,Too small to get the gem into the base had to throw them out sadly.
1.0,Do not buy this. The shorts material and the waist band has a weird smell and even after washing it it did not go away. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,"Color not as advertised. Is was supposed to be a tan base color, but it is red.<br />Red is not even an option for the models available."
1.0,"The product did not work on my three hats I used one bottle up and it did not make a difference. I highly disapprove of this product ,I feel it was a waste of my money and time"
1.0,This tarnished after 3 weeks.
1.0,Couldn't fit. It looks so thick and it says it's the same size as my current.
1.0,This is so cheaply made. It is so thin that it is see thru. Proportions are also not right. It fit at my waist just fine but it was very loose at the breasts. I wear a 38DD so things are normally tight on me around that area and not loose. In my opinion this dress is not even worth $5. I'm returning it.
1.0,Wore this once & it broke. It's cute looking but doesn't hold up very disappointed.
1.0,Broke as soon as i tried to put it on when i got it
1.0,This just arrived today upon opening the package you smell a horrible nail polish remover-ish smell it's a weird smell to them the fabric I can't really say of it it cotton it may have cotton mixed in with whatever other material.the masks look like they are for Children instead of Adults  this wasn't a good buy I could of went to the corner store or Dollar General and bought the package of Hanes masks without the smell with the correct size without having to wait not knowing if they would be correct size color fit non smelling ect...
1.0,Broke when I tried to put it on.  Its design is flawed and it's cheap.  Tossed in the trash.  What a waste!
1.0,Sandals are not for wide feet. I think it’s too late to return them. I’m hoping my mother can wear them.
1.0,Unfortunately only for Halloween...
1.0,It's like wish.com. no. Just no. Poorly made and much smaller than expected
1.0,These are a shiny material and 2 sizes to small. I ordered clans they were like a medium. Retuning
1.0,"I was super excited about this shirt. But upon getting it my excitement quickly turned to disappointment.<br />This shirt is VERY sheer, paper thin, and cut much shorter then shown in the picture.<br />The material is soft and feels nice on the skin. Would be a wonderful shirt if the flaws mentioned above where corrected ."
1.0,Shrunk a ton after washing! Doesn't fit anymore.
1.0,"Clip on sun glasses are generally smallish...like glasses, these are left overs from 1980...they are huge and look ridiculous,"
1.0,The style and fit were not as I expected . Great quality and return was great
1.0,So disappointed. Will not order from them again. Material is super itchy and thin. Small fit... very small. No quality.<br />I got half back.
1.0,"First, I have long thin fingers and these gloves were cutting into the skin between my fingers.<br /><br />Second, they were really puffy and felt very cheep. I literally took them right back off and threw them back in the box and returned them the next day."
1.0,Very cheaply made. I went to wear them for the first time and the backing fell apart. Really disappointed as they looked so pretty
1.0,"Size up or just dont buy idk. Thigh area was tight, rest of the leg was perfect. front area was baggy but the back area was tight. They fit like they were made backwards in a way if that makes sense?!"
1.0,"horrible fit, super boxy, does not hang, neckline is awful.  Print looks like photo and thats about it"
1.0,Not cotton. Not organic. Not anti-slip.
1.0,When we opened the box one of the flowers wasn’t attached to the earring.
1.0,Awful quality. The gold tone wore off within one week.
1.0,was mis-swen on the back causing a odd bulge around the back area. garbage and waste of money
1.0,"Thought this would be a great umbrella.  But unfortunately it keeps falling. The metal clutch to hold on to the umbrella is way to weak and small.  So this was a waste money and now time, having to put it back up Everytime we come outside."
1.0,"False advertising! There is no nose clip, material is not breathable tried it on for 10 seconds and my face was sweating! It is adorable but the material and fit suck!"
1.0,Was very disappointed with regards to the effectiveness of the adhesive. Bra kept getting loose
1.0,"Save your money! The shirt shrinks after one wash and it came 4 days late. Remember,you get what you pay for.Don't buy from China to save money."
1.0,Look nise but stone is nut good
1.0,"Very dull bracelet.  Not much shine to it.<br /><br />The quality doesn't look like the pictures.<br /><br />Pretty concept bracelet though.<br /><br />Sad that it wasn't all that I expected, from the pictures."
1.0,I don't like it. It was cute in the picture.
1.0,"Sooooo sad just because it cost less doesn't mean it should be crap..  Thin, tears easy definitely don't workout in them.  I am a athlete with an athletic build it's horrible.."

1.0,Cute but not what picture shows
1.0,I should have known but I’m a sucker.  This hat is just a piece of cut out felt with some really cheap stuff glued to it
1.0,I have purchased $5 versions of this product on ebay that are way better than this. I followed instructions from this page and the bra still didn't stick to my skin properly and was wrinkled around the edges. It did absolutely nothing it claimed to do. Worst product I have bought on Amazon ever.
1.0,"It broke on the second day. Not too sure why, my son only had three keys hanging from the hook."
1.0,There was a lot of potential for this dress.. but the material was terrible. The pattern was printed on while fabric and was see through. Don’t waste you time or money.
1.0,am very this appointed with it material is very cheap and thin and I order two but I would like to cancel the next one or stop it from arriving and I would like my money back or a refund
1.0,Sizes are completely inaccurate. Wasted my money.
1.0,"As usual, I read the product reviews before ordering....I returned it today....<br />The fit is odd....the sleeves and top are cut to fit like a t-shirt somewhat fitted, the hood is huge, from the waist area<br />down it flares somewhat A-line and covers my feet when standing. I am 5'4""  126 lb. and<br />normally take a medium in lounging items. I don't know who this is supposed to fit."
1.0,It did not work. Second hand was not moving
1.0,Very small  even sized up still not good. Definitely find very small Not true to size need to return

1.0,"beautiful colors, great padding BUT it runs definitely a size smaller, wish I would have known!<br /><br />okay, definitely TOO SMALL"
1.0,"It attracts lint like crazy and if you see the photo, that how it looks like AFTER you wash it. Absolute garbage quality but I should’ve figured considering it’s made in China."
1.0,Not same to what's pictured... Scam
1.0,these socks would be great if they stayed in place at the heel.  I now have 6 pairs of useless socks.
1.0,Was a nice product. Ripped after one wash
1.0,I ordered these lugs because one of my olds ones lost a screw and I figured since they were scratched up ill order new ones. I threw my old ones away after I received these and when I went to put them on my gear s2 watch they would not latch all the way on. They did not fit. It made me so mad. Do not buy the if you have the same watch I do.
1.0,"This mask does not fit close to the face, large open gap on face. poor protect a waste of money."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on these rings. ...they are nothing like the picture or the description. Threw them away after opening them up, they weren't even worth sending back."
1.0,"Shrinks badly, and now i can't return it!!!"
1.0,"Ordered an XL for hubby, sleeves were 1/2 inch too short. Smh. Poor quality."
1.0,These pants ripped the first day I wore them. Wanted to get them replaced but it seemed like a struggle that I wasn't willing to take.
1.0,Nothing it broke
1.0,"Massively too big, gaps at every angle. Useless as a face cover. Toxic outgas horrific smell. Useless as a face cover both because of gaps at every single angle, but also because its too thin. My guess it, it would outgas within a few weeks of being left outside on the front porch. Most accurate description for this item is: TOXIC BUT STYLISH FACE COVER FOR GIANTS OR WOMEN WITH LARGE BEARDS. It is just huge, wrinkly, collapses everywhere, gaps everywhere. NOT A FACE COVER."
1.0,Don’t like. Not as pictured
1.0,This was made for a 10year old
1.0,They are very thin and not at all what I was expecting. They look like little rubber bands and the colors are not very good. I would not purchase these again.
1.0,"Ordering these sandals is troublesome.  Sizes are way the @... off.  So far I have ordered two pairs and returned them both, The first time I thought I was shipped the wrong size.  A size 7 should be a size 7.  Today I ordered a supposed size 8 and they had better fit."
1.0,Was to small and they didn't even light up
1.0,"Mine was torn :( It is also fairly short, I was expected it to be like on the photo, but it barely covers the butt and I am not that tall. Will be returning it."
1.0,I received my tank top with holes all over the bottom in the back! Not happy at all
1.0,Not worth it too much for a person with a small face and wears glasses. No this did not meet my expectations.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:dc289f1bf14d9ed6c8c139456b849868]] The lace is not sown down, its floppy. VERY poorly made. See video"

1.0,"I’m only 5’1 and item is way to short for me, can’t imagine how anyone could wear it. More of a pain to return it than it’s worth"
1.0,For anybody who is seeing this.. I have this necklace and what you paid is way too much.. I bought that necklace at hot topic for like $8 so yeah that's a rip off big time. Hopefully somebody sees this and doesn't buy one from this person
1.0,Awful quality nd came all wrinkled. I thought by keeping it out the wrinkles would go away but they are still there. Material feels like paper. Don’t buy
1.0,Just the right size. Very comfortable.
1.0,Fits much smaller than advertised as...order size up.
1.0,Order three sizes up and still didn’t fit.
1.0,"strangely constructed of a heavyweight polyester that doesn't stretch, but should have some give when the waistband is elastic. They basically fit but are completely unwearable."
1.0,"Metal clasp broke walking through on second use, rendering strap useless."
1.0,"The straps are totally dysfunctional. My bathing suit came with straps that come out from the middle of my chest, instead of the sides of my breasts. Not at all what was pictured. I am returning."
1.0,"NOT a drawstring waist. Wide elastic waist with a string for decoration more than anything. Thin cut legs, like a legging. Return is charging $6. Lousy all the way around!"
1.0,"Started ripping at the seems within a couple wears, pretty at first look but overall poor quality and craftsmanship. You won’t get a lot of wear out of it"
1.0,Sizing is way off. Extremely small fitting.
1.0,OMG I almost fell off my bed. They call these thick. This is the size of a nickel!! What a disappointment. I was looking for something large and thick. AND it has a small dent. For $250 bucks what a joke. I am speechless. DO NOT GO BY THE SO CALLED PICTURE ON THE LADIES EARS. Return tomorrow.
1.0,My wallet ripped and I haven’t had it more than a month

1.0,sizing is horrible
1.0,This product is nothing like the picture. It was so thin and poorly made. It wouldn't keep my dog warm. It looked like it was warn and walked 100 times. So thin. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. It took almost a month to come.
1.0,"Don't waste your time, let alone your money on this. It arrived broken, and it's literally the thinnest, cheapest metal imaginable. Extremely soft. $20, more like $4."
1.0,It smelled weird.<br />Not soft. Order a Medium is was more like a small
1.0,haha...my my what can I say.  I feel like the incredible hulk by how easily they rip.  I bought 4 and all of them shredded while taking them off.  probably I should have gotten XXL so it doesn't fit snug (which defeats the purpose)
1.0,These were missing the ball on the end…
1.0,Happy Family bead is of very poor quality on the faces.  The red heart is the only thing that stands out and for the price of this bead it is not worth it.  I am returning it.
1.0,This was waaaayyyy too small
1.0,"The print quality is awful, but the quote is funny and the cat looks exactly like my daughter’s fat cat, so we’re keeping it."
1.0,I got it for my mom as a just because i love her present and i was very disappointed  The chain is thin and has broken several times my mother keeps trying to put it back together and it keeps breaking. I have tried to reach out to the seller to send me a return mailing label for months to send it back because its broken in all different pieces and they refused to mail me a return label ... So many times i have tried .. Its disheartening !!!  Don't waste your money !!!!!! Its worthless and good luck trying to return it !!! So rude !!!
1.0,Worst product I have never seen like these
1.0,Cheaply made. Very disappointed in quality. And runs small.
1.0,Super disappointed with this product. It looks like the item you would find at the 99 cents store. Not even worth to send it back  to China 😣don’t waste your money on this! Super ugly .
1.0,I did not like the material and it was a lot smaller than expected.
1.0,The magnet is weak keep falling off..
1.0,It says 10 pieces but I only recieved 7. I expected to get all 10 pieces and *specifically* bought this for the silver pair but never recieved those and the brass ball hoop. Would have loved it if it came with all it said it would.
1.0,"Stitching fell apart. These are either counterfeit or really, really, really really old."
1.0,Definitely read the reviews!!!!
1.0,"I order style F, and instead got what is pictured in my review. Not even close or realistic at all."
1.0,Was to short n ran very small..order a XL fit like a medium..not happy at all with this purchase
1.0,The ring is beautiful but isn’t silver - turns finger green
1.0,Broken when it arrived. The blue stones were not attached to the bracelet. Waste of money.
1.0,Runs large. Cheaply made. The thread was torn when it arrived
1.0,Was very excited about this product as who doesn't want to look good all day. I got them in the mail and upon opening one clasp for the VERY first time it broke....I put it back in the box and returned it.
1.0,nowhere does it say it's silver and the cat is crooked
1.0,Doesn't fit at all to my watch
1.0,"Beautiful print, but fits large and is very boxy.  No shaping through bust leaves lots of extra fabric between arms and chest. Returned."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:903ac4cc70749b5b7fcf313afa83605e]]
1.0,Quality is awful - be warned - this is the second time I am writing this review because somehow it has been scrubbed form amazon.
1.0,Good thing these come in a 20 pack because every 2 days it breaks and I have to replace it!!  The hinge on the snap is very weak and just breaks from me hooking or unhooking it. Junk.
1.0,I’m so disappointed. I can’t get the bands off my watch. So I guess I’m stuck...if you want to buy multiple bands-don’t by this or else you will be stuck with what you have.
1.0,"Dry rotted!  3 out of 4 pairs ripped after taking from pack.  I have one pair that will wear tomorrow.  I have to be really careful not to tear, which is done by simply touching."
1.0,Horrible quality and the size is not as described
1.0,Loses color quick.  I guess you get what you pay for though.
1.0,"These rings looks cheap. I definitely wouldn't buy this again. In fact, I'd probably throw these away since I'd never wear them."
1.0,This was not long or oversized as shown in the picture.  I sent it back because it wasn't a very good quality all around and certainly not as comfy as the picture implies.
1.0,Only works if you push the button on the side.
1.0,Showed up shattered.
1.0,"If I could give negative stars I would... first off I ordered it the day after thanksgiving, I got it 2 days before Christmas. The graphic was so poorly done that I’m afraid to wash it for it might disappear. It is not a hoodie rather a cheap long sleeve t-shirt with a hood. My nephew will freeze if he wears it as a hoodie. I ended up having to purchase another item from the actual Logan Paul store to make him happy, terrible experience and a waste of money and time."
1.0,"The shirt is beautiful and material is very soft, but the size is not true.  I ordered a 4x but it fits like a 2x.  Just be careful with sizing."
1.0,Sizes are much smaller than I expected or regularly wear
1.0,Didnt like the material. It’s very stretchy weird material
1.0,It broke 4 months later and it’s past return date so you get stuck it a broken belt.
1.0,The dress looks absolutely NOTHING like the dress pictured! Very VERY thin material. It's just a regular chiffon dress. Skirt portion is nowhere near as full as in product pictures. I'm really disappointed for the price I paid. My fault for not reading reviews beforehand.
1.0,"The cap is not as large as it appears in the picture. It's suitable for a child. On an adult, it's so tight that it would chafe at the edges of the hair and cause breakage. That is the opposite of what a cap is meant to do."
1.0,"The red color is definitely not red it's more a burgundy, not as shown in the listing."
1.0,The H2O necklace is like something you would get at the dollar store toy section.
1.0,These shrunk in the waist and in length. So much for comfortable pants
1.0,Worthless purchase. Doesn’t even resemble a shirt.
1.0,"Very stiff and cheap-feeling, like it's made out of plastic (there's no way this is leather, as claimed in the description). Zipper does not move smoothly. Smells of chemicals. Made in China. Very difficult to get my credit cards out of the little super-tight slots. My phone fits inside, which is nice, but that's the only good thing I have to say. I would not recommend this product, nor would I purchase it again. Very disappointed that I bought this. Be aware that there is a $4 restocking fee if you return it, which is absurd, considering how outrageously overpriced it is to begin with.<br />____________<br />Update, 4/21/2015: I take it back--my phone doesn't fit now that I have coins in the center section. With my phone in the wallet, it won't zip up. And my whole purse stinks of the nasty chemicals this thing is throwing off."
1.0,Completely see through and wrong size
1.0,"Very cheaply made, the zip is hard to use and the white tape from the package was stuck on the tule of the dress"
1.0,"The film/color on the pair on bought started peeling after a few weeks. Csnt find company contact to resolve, but seems to be common with these."
1.0,Ive had the watch less than 2 weeks. As it waterproof I do not take it off and wear it in the shower. Crystal got cloudy in ~7 days or so and stopped working yesterday after 14 days or so. Good looking watch. Liked it until....
1.0,Horrible quality. Used once and broke apart at the seams
1.0,"it’s very low quality and see through, it’s also not very true to size and i recommend sizing down."
1.0,very cheaply made. with bad material...
1.0,The size is xxxl. I am a size 2X.  This is not in the 3X cats gory.  It is too small. Are you using petite sizing? 👎🏼
1.0,I ordered an xl and received a small!! It also smelled really bad like cheap perfume! Very very strong smell! Received it today and returned it right back today..
1.0,Arrived broke
1.0,The chain broke the first time it was worn.
1.0,It was ok material a little  thick.
1.0,I ordered this and chose a size small for my series 6 watch but the pink one I was sent was much larger than any small I have received. So disappointed.
1.0,Super small I wear a 16 and a 3X was super tight
1.0,The coller leaks extremely. And makes a horrible mess. Used it one time and was very disappointed.
1.0,Isn't worth it! Don't buy it! I received mine and it came with missing stones. It's very poor quality! Not happy
1.0,"Doesn't look like picture.  It is known there are knock offs of this product.  So, we ordered from Amazon & the letters are dull we received  -- like a T-shirt screen print. (Not at all like the picture)<br /><br />The packaging doesn't show the company name ""Vinfashirt Exchange"" at all that we bought it from. It shows ""1044"" and has no other info. This appears to be a knock off. Amazon should verify this with company for others.<br /><br />It was a birthday gift and my daughter is disappointed - as we are."
1.0,I am returning it!<br />False advertising<br />Poor quality<br />Flimsy
1.0,"These trousers' fabric content is listed as: 45% Cotton+45%Linen+10% spandex.  But the actual content is: 65% Polyester and 35% Cotton.  So the fabric is really cheap also the construction is poor.  They are no where near as wide as they look, they're basically a wide leg trousers and NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PHOTO.  Had I known the actual fabric content there is no way I would've purchased them!!  As far as this garment is concerned these are REALLY BAD and should be avoided if you think they are actually anywhere similar to the photo.  I've contacted the seller so we'll see if they respond."
1.0,Half the price on the manufacturer's own website.
1.0,Too small. Doesn’t fit well according to my normal size
1.0,small and fell apart.
1.0,"Boots were so thin and flimsy they were folded over in the box for packaging. Soles, cheap and thin. I did not even put them on. I just sent them back."
1.0,very disappointed! cheap product!
1.0,"The body of the suit fits like a small while the chest fit like an XXL!  There is absolutely no support in the bust, and if your chest is even slightly on the larger side, this suit is gonna show some serious side-boob."
1.0,You get what pay for.... Fell to pieces smh
1.0,Very very very top band.
1.0,"I was So disappointed with this dress. First off it’s supposed to be White. That’s why I purchased it - for a church function. It was a dingy off white. Second, I ordered the correct size and it fits too tight-and last of all the material is awful! Some polyester blend/ waitress uniform looking stuff. I hate it- didn’t wear it and will return it- it actually smells as if it was already worn and returned- it really gets no star from me."
1.0,Runs small but that is not the problem.  The fabric is cheap and does not flow like the picture.  It's stiff and ugly.
1.0,"Its torn at the back of the neck. That's the way I received it, haven't even worn it. Also, the fabric is not soft, it's very scratchy."
1.0,Useless.... wouldn’t even fit over a can of soup so not sure how it goes on a human head. Not even an infant would fit inside. Looks more like a marble bag.
1.0,These gloves are not fleece they are a very cheap felt .
1.0,"It is much shorter and wider than the picture indicates. However, the sleeves are too narrow and the bodice is too tight (I am only average in the chest).  Yet, the waist is wider than the picture indicates. The material is thin and the pattern is dull (not bright like the picture).  Not a flattering blouse at all. Returning it."
1.0,Way too small and when I tried putting it on I ripped the inside lining so now I can't even return it.  Would not recommend buying unless you are very petite.
1.0,I purchased for an event this weekend and I’m bummed that This item runs extremely small ! I wish there was a leather selection of sizes since it doesn’t run true to American sizing. Wouldn’t buy from them again as I can’t deal with the inconvenience that inconsistency of sizing brings with this company.
1.0,"Bought two, both stopped opening/closing properly with very occasional use."
1.0,"They were cheap, bent trying to get them through his ears - and not worth the trouble.. very upset by this purchase."
1.0,"Whoever said these were a gym shark dupe was SO wrong. These are nowhere near the quality or even the same texture as gym shark leggings. I got black, and they are definitely NOT squat proof. They are comfortable for day-to-day wear and flattering, but if you're looking for good workout leggings, save your money!"
1.0,"I Didn't get the color purple that I wanted. I ordered it prime because I needed it by the 31st of May. Came on time 😀. However, wrong color 😥."
1.0,This item was too small and the quality of the item was poor
1.0,Only got 4 rings and the one that i specifically ordered it for was not included.
1.0,I have a black dog and I wanted it to be dark and it’s barley out lined In black.<br />Unless you look at it up close you can’t tell what it is. I wish it was darker like the picture in the display<br /><br />When customer service fixes it then I will fix this comment
1.0,"I received the black one a day or two after Christmas which did surprise me. I'm still waiting for the red one and am told I have to wait until January 23rd to get it. It REALLY isn't worth waiting a whole month and a half to get it. It came with no instructions on the different ways to wear it, it is very thin and you can see threw it so if your planing on wearing it as a dress or a shirt I would advise to wear something under it unless your going to some kind of swingers party in which I'm sure it doesn't matter what you wear. I would return it if it wasn't for the fact that S & H charges was more then the scarf but then you get what you pay for. I suggest don't waste your money."
1.0,This shirt runs huge! And looks kinda like a gold trash bag it’s kind of see through. The length is short but the width I could have fit in it twice!
1.0,"I thought I could &#34;package&#34; my husband's ground Kona coffee and have it ready to go for him each morning while traveling since he drinks 2 cups. The fru-fru coffee I drink has nothing left inside the K-Cup when brewed so I thought using them would be perfect.  It just seemed like the perfect idea.  What a mess.  As much as I'd like to have been able to re-use K-Cups to reduce waste, it just wasn't worth it.  The basket K-Cup he's had for years works WAAAAAY better."
1.0,"Did not fit, anklets should have longer chains"
1.0,"Only came with one. The picture shows three but there’s only one, if I had known that I wouldn’t have paid eight busks for a 1 oz bunny."
1.0,The tag is all in Chinese and a large fits a 9 year old girl.  I got a large for a woman and they are a joke.  Unless you want kids underwear do not buy this product!!!
1.0,"The fit was great, and, it’s super-cute .. but, the material is odd .. virtually, everything “sticks” to it .. ok to wear to a holiday gathering - but, I’ll most likely, never try to wash it :/"
1.0,Smaller than it looks. An Ipad mini 4 will barely fit with no room for anything else. Will not order again!
1.0,"The knit PJ seems a bit warm for summer unless one has the AC on cold. Would like it a little looser. Ordinarily wear a large, but did purchase an extra large. Suggest putting this garment in the Petit sizes. Extremely tight waist band. It is scratchy even after using downy in the rinse. Do not recommend buying pajamas with spandex."
1.0,The material is the worst!! You can't put this on withou getting shocked over and over. Can't even imagine putting it on in the winter! No wonder it came vacuum wrapped!
1.0,"This belt product lasted for less than one year.  The belt buckle has broken, and does not look like it can be repaired.  It was a waste of money!!!"
1.0,Piece of junk. Zipper broken right out of the box. Sent it back.
1.0,"The bag is lovely at first sight, but it is not very sturdy. I've only had it a couple of months. If you are looking for longevity, this is not it."
1.0,Why wife wore them once.  Fell apart the first time.  What a ripoff.
1.0,very cheap and small. the chain isn't long at all. haven't worn it once
1.0,"I have been buying from Amazon for years and this is the first time I've given a bad review on anything. Please, please, please don't buy this dress. I am very disappointed. It is nothing like how it looks in the picture. It's like a very cheap sheet, no shape, sewn up one side and down the other. Even the neckline isn't the same. There is no way to roll the sleeves to make them look like the picture. Again it is nothing like the picture. I wanted this for vacation when I went down to breakfast at the hotel or for an evening stroll along the beach. I'm now going to wear it to sleep in."
1.0,"I read the reviews and I know better, but my size is ""small"".  This contraption is ""small/toddler size"".  Seriously.  Only a 2 year old child could fit in this.  It's too late for me to return it, so it is going to Goodwill.  Maybe there is a 2 year old child who needs shaping garments hahaha!"
1.0,"The mask delivered was solid glossy black cheap and flimsy looking. Did not look like the picture they have here on Amazon, which looks like a nice quality mask with gold swirl in the material. I returned it."
1.0,Gave to a friend to wear.
1.0,I would not recommend this bag. I used it exactly 4 times for special events and the main zipper closure broke on the fourth use.
1.0,I wore them like four times it was cute I guess play turnt Brown pretty quickly and became extremely unwearable
1.0,"I return this item same day it arrived. The colors were not the same as the picture and the cord appeared cheap. I was getting this for my mom, but the red cord was not a bright red but more of a brownish-red. There was no way my mom would accept the color or quality so they went back"
1.0,the top is perfect size however the bottoms were way to small and the material was not durable
1.0,RHINESTONE MISSING!!! Amazon wanted me to return the “tried on” mask this is 🤢 disgusting! And go through a hassle to return them so that I can get a refund. Definitely going to start to support LOCAL small businesses. Never again!
1.0,Bought for my 13 yr. old grandson. Didn't bother to give to him because I knew he wouldn't wear it. Very cheaply made. Cost too much for postage to return.
1.0,"Not flexible, very unforgiving fabric, had to stretch it out to make it reach my ears. Terrible fit."
1.0,This bra is super cute but it digs in the side of your boob. I order another one a size bigger and it does the exact same thing. Very disappointing.
1.0,Este articulos vienen por separado yo lo que hice los uni para tirarle las fotos pero si se la recomiendo muy buena calidad y muy hermosos .. idea para regalar.. tienen un 10 me ecanto y las pantallas muy hermosa y fino ..
1.0,"We bought these for our 4 yr old granddaughter. With in two weeks the top seam was splitting. The lace on top also is fraying. Very cute boots, not worth the price."
1.0,Really ugly
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:25e5fcc65228de04ae74284b3be80406]] The zipper will not close. So the Waller is now wide open. Now I gave to go back to using my other wallet with a broken strap. Why is it impossible to get a semi descent fully functioning wristlet to carry my phone, debit and other small essentials? I mean I only care my phone, wireless earbuds , medical cards and I.D. I cannot seem to find anything too last. Don't buy it,<br />It was cute and soft. It does have a lot of slots and reasonable amount of pockets. I don't like the middle part cause it looks sewn together and there are exposed gaps. I should've  listened to roger reviews about  the zipper."
1.0,I would NOT purchase again. Very cheap looking with what appears to be a very poorly done iron on applique. Definitely not what I expected. I bought it for a 1 1/2 year old and it would be better suited for a two month old as far as size goes. It does stretch. The material is compared to a pair of little girls tights. Definitely not worth the price!
1.0,its a square thing... Im regret that I bought this blouse... the quality of the fabric its 100% polyester.
1.0,No fitting at all. I need my refund!!
1.0,Do not get this if you are an XS. It looks nothing like this on.
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture! I was very disappointed and sent it right back.
1.0,Bought this dress a size up and the arms are tight and the hole for head is tiny. Poor Fit and cheap material.
1.0,"Do my buy! This band is not durable for normal child everyday wear. We have now gone through 2 of these in a matter of a few weeks and anytime the rubber is stretch, it breaks at the pin part."
1.0,De mala calidad .
1.0,Paint came off
1.0,"Sólo yego un paquetito de 10 y hay trae que son 50 y en enboltura individual , entonces cuál es lo verdadero."
1.0,Interior lining ripped within 2 weeks.  Not sturdy.  Love the look but poor quality
1.0,gloves suck they came apart at the seams  and they didn't keep my hand warm . not even one star.
1.0,Not fit as described. Disappointed
1.0,Suprisingly too small I can't even put my foot in!not happy!
1.0,Definitely not as described very cheaply made bad stitch an uncomfortable fit
1.0,Very thin  fabric . Buttons had loops not button holes which will easily tear . Stitching is poorly stitched . Sorry I purchased it - ! Back has a long tail front ties poorly
1.0,Update: Ordered a replacement and came with no band again. Description also has mention of band removed.<br /><br />Great deal and they look good. Missing the elastic band so I can’t use them on my dog’s collar like I want to. Might be a mistake so I’ll try to return and get another order sent
1.0,The design is advertised on the front of the tee. It’s on the back.
1.0,"At first, I loved my Bike Cube. In fact, I bought the red one as a gift. But, my delight was short lived.  The bag lining deteriorated into little bits and pieces getting into all of my gear.<br />The bag became unusable. The same thing happened to the larger red one."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this bracelet to try with the new oils I ordered. The bracelet was beautiful and held the oils for several days. I loved it, but am only giving it one star because it broke the third time I wore it. The elastic band that holds the beads must not be made well at all. Very disappointing and won't be ordering more as gifts as I had planned."
1.0,Not what I expected doesn't seem like a real stone it was really light weight for 6.50 ct. Did not receive a receipt nor warranty only the pendent with fragile chain was in shipping envelope :(
1.0,Had to return because the battery was not included.
1.0,Had this for a month and loved it. Then it stopped charging. And can't return/exchange. Disappointing.
1.0,What the hell????? Look like a shifty copy and paste.
1.0,Did not work over my 9 months old granddaughter’s snowsuit... would not stay in as snowsuit very thick... wish they would design something that works!
1.0,"This backpack is too hard to keep closed.  The draw string doesn't stay tight; it's very hard to keep it secure.  This makes it pretty impractical for my purposes.  I wanted something easy to carry around on day trips in the city, but things keep feeling like they are about to fall out."
1.0,flower fell off before first use...
1.0,"Received was defective right out of the package. Liked the look, but disappointed arrived broken. Couldn't try it on since it was broken. Ordered another let's see if this one arrives damaged I  hope not. Will review again after I receive the second one"
1.0,"They sent me a package containing one adapter for the 38mm Apple Watch and one adapter for the 42mm, so obviously that doesn't work for my 42mm Apple Watch!! Also, the main issue is that the color is gloss black and not even close to matching the Space Gray Apple Watch!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"I was looking for something casual for travels, and had seen this blazer mentioned favorably. When I opened it, I knew almost immediately I would be returning it. It’s a heavy wool blazer, and not a good wool. It was too tight, but I’ll take the blame for not reading the fine print that it’s a slim fit blazer. Mainly, it’s just a cheap piece of junk. The front lining wasn’t sewn in under the arms, and it just billowed like they expected you to use them as body length storage. If you’re thinking about this blazer, just say no."
1.0,"I bought an XL , it’s more like a small . So tiny, it’s a shame as they look so comfy."
1.0,Was not a 2X like it said. It was extremely small.
1.0,These are not what the  picture shows! These are barely visible IF you can get them in and and locked!<br />I feel ripped off!
1.0,La camiseta tiene una tela de muy baja calidad la primera que recibí que me regaló mi hija cuando la lavé pasó de ser talla S a una M o más porque les la tela se estira no es una tela consistente una de las camisetas que recibí estaba dañada con la tela en el cuello con dos agujeros y una mancha amarilla y la tela parecía como vieja o podrida y francamente no era lo que esperaba
1.0,"The glasses seemed quite good - the anti-glare feature seemed to work (my eyes seemed less tired at the end of the day after 8 to 10 hour computer usage).<br />BUT... the hinges broke off within 2 months of purchase (not even 2 months). I had bought another pair of the same manufacturer (different glasses) and started using them. I travel a lot, so finally tried to contact them today about the broken hinges. Well, the number they have provided is *NOT* a real phone number or an active phone number. THAT GIVES ME A HUGE PAUSE!!!! (Have a question for EYEKEPPER-US? Customer Service Phone: 551-574-6671)<br /><br />Will get in touch with Amazon directly now :("
1.0,Horrible . Order to and they both would not work.
1.0,Enormously tote!  Was misrepresented.
1.0,"Shipping took a month, literally, I considered keeping it once it finally arrived but the suit runs small.  On a positive note, The suit does look to be real leather and decent quality. Seller has changed the name of the company so I don't think I'm the first to have trouble."
1.0,"I bought these for hot, humid weather and because the description stated cotton linen fabric. As you can see from the picture, 35% is polyester.  Seller needs to update the product details to be honest about what they’re selling."
1.0,i should have read reviews.. it looks nice... and the title was delux so i thought it would work nicley.. but you can pop it out nicley the brim is too soft so it wont pop out you have to get stuck in to it and pull it open for it to come out
1.0,RETURNED item
1.0,If you have big hips. Don’t even bother. This wouldn’t even go past my waist. What a joke.
1.0,Very poor quality for the price. Lots of corners cut with this item. Will be sending it back.
1.0,One of my worst purchases.  The upper frame snapped in half under gentle use.
1.0,"When I first received these earrings they looked a pretty nice blue color.  However, after wearing a few times the blue color came off in strips.  It was not blue glass but just a glaze put on the surface of white glass.  I now have white earrings that look worthless,  and I am not wearing them.  I think it's false advertising to say the least."
1.0,Not the size ordered. The label says the size I ordered but the item fits a child or a very small woman.
1.0,Did not live up to the description.
1.0,It has a terrible smell and it is not roomy at all. I strongly recommend not to buy this product.
1.0,the watch quit working after six days.
1.0,I didn't like the material and it was too small for it to be xxl. I am so disappointed in the product. Why was I sent another pair. I wanted them returned they didn't fit and I want a refund
1.0,"My son is 5, he told me the mask is bothering him and scratching his face. I just thought he was just being sensitive until I saw a long scratch on his face when he wore his 2nd mask. The corners of the metal wires to shape around the nose are too sharp and it’s definitely not safe for young children.<br /><br />Also description says this mask is from 5-12 years, I doubt it’ll fit older kids when this mask fits my 5 year old perfectly.<br /><br />Considering these masks were made for young children, perhaps putting extra padding on the corner of metal wires is highly recommended.<br />Other than the safety issues, it is a well made and comfortable masks but safety comes first."
1.0,"No son de buena calidad, solo lo utilice unos minutos y se rompio,"
1.0,This was a very nice dress But it was so small it could fit my 11 year old daughter. I wear a size 12 I order a XL emailed the company and this was the suggested  sizes still too small.
1.0,4 showers and the military green became cream with a little rusty orange.  I dunno.  You yell me.  I have no idea where that came from.
1.0,"Excited to get watch and wear! Seemed to be good value from CHINA! BOUGHT 2, ONE FOR ME ONE FOR SON! JUNK! JUNK!  NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WATER [RESISTANCE!] SEAL YOUR WATCHS PROPLY!! Atleast not to fill up with moisture from SWEAT!!! MINE AND MY SONS DO IT!!! JUNK!! MAKE REAL WATER RESISTANCE AND GET A 5!! LEAKS AT GLASS!!"
1.0,Poor quality picture
1.0,Two major problems with this product: had to return<br />1) Does NOT fit oculus quest 2 controllers that have the anker rechargeable batteries installed.<br />2)  NO instructions included and online videos don't show how the tether straps are installed (just show the hand strap installation)
1.0,Wouldn't even fit a small child
1.0,Not happy at all. Cheaply made and way toooooo small.
1.0,"Yikes, one fell off at work and I couldn’t find it.  I’m back to the disposables"
1.0,"Dont bother with this vest. I measured myself exactly as it stated on the chart. I have a small waist, but my bust is 41 inches. So I ordered the XL for the additional room and I cant even bring the vest together in the front. Of course I believe every girl should try for themselves but if you are ANYWHERE past 40 inches in the bust area DONT BOTHER! This was a massive disappointment!!"
1.0,The pins that hold the buckle latch broke after the first use. I find this is inferior quality and would NOT recommend it.
1.0,Not happy with this product.  Can't seem to get it to fit my head properly.  Didn't expect so much difficulty.
1.0,"Arrived with a broken clasp. While this watch is clearly cheap (it is a Casio after all), you can find a better watch for a better price at Walmart."
1.0,Says it's a one piece but it's definitely a 2 piece... and fits nowhere near the size it states!
1.0,"I ordered a small per the size chart and while it fit the waist was absolutely enourmous and the chest was so tight if you have large breasts it’s obscene. It’s borderline pornographic and asking for a nipslip. The slit in the went all the the way up to the middle of my spine you would have to be sooooo tall for this to remotely look right. The zipper barely worked, I could barely get it unzipped before I even tried to get it on, and on it’s poorly made. The shoulders are uneven width and it’s cut strange so one side is shaped different than the other and doesn’t lay flat against my shoulder. It’s so ridiculous."
1.0,I don’t like these at all. Cheap shiny looking. Way too tight in waist and huge in thighs. Look cheap.
1.0,They didn’t show that they are sparkly and they fit weird. The material is very cheap feeling.
1.0,Ordered large and its smaller than an A cup
1.0,"Very small... I'm usually a medium (5&#34;5/140lbs) and ordered a large and it was WAY too small.  the color is more of a burgundy than red and though it appears to be a wrap type, there is only a sash that you tie around your waist."
1.0,It was cheaply made . Not waterproof. Still sitting in my closet . I never gave it as a gift . Missed the return window so I’m stuck with this cheap piece of crap
1.0,I ordered a size smaller and it is still too big. It fits like a potato sack. I have a few things from Allegra K and I generally order a size smaller because they think Americans are larger than we are. At one size smaller it is still ginormous. Sent back.
1.0,Line is crooked from front to back one side is bigger than the other side. Contacted seller no help at all. Not worth it for the price!!!!!
1.0,Run extremely small. But they are cute
1.0,No me llego el color que pedi
1.0,No me gusto en absoluto
1.0,This is by far the worst purchase that I've had through Amazon thus far. Not only was this outfit stitched inside out but even the tags were on the outside. Check out the picture
1.0,"The product is not marked 925 silver & they showed a necklace & bracelet, no bracelet..but that's ok I won't wear this junk any way. My bad for ordering."
1.0,I had bought 4 of these for my bridesmaids. 2 of thrm are missing jewels in the necklace and earrings. Returning immediately.
1.0,This top is huge!! The description of the top is not correct. The material is not as described.
1.0,Worst product
1.0,The fabric looks like grad robe material. Only appropriate for sleepwear. Very cheap looking!
1.0,Ugly and weird fit
1.0,"Looks ok, comfortable when I put on, but diopter part to small I coud not use it!!!"
1.0,"Totally misleading and not as advertised.  Do not just hand these to your kids cause they are cute, but actually look at them. They do not adjust  for a proper fit, they are hard bumpy plastic wrapped with cute fabric.  The ears parts it has have a hard ridge and hard plastic pushing on your face and ears.  HOW did these pass inspection or sell on any market.  I'm baffled by some reviews that day they are good... we must have recieved a severely faulty pair because these horrible. Buy somewhere else. Please note... seller will make you pay return shipping in their bogus product. I'll be calling amazon directly."
1.0,broke the moment i took it out.
1.0,Returned these after just a few days since the letters peeled off. They're stick on letters.  Do not recommend for this price
1.0,The dress did not fit well. It was too tight and the zipper was difficult to unzip. I returned the dress and it cost me almost as much as the dress to return it. Pretty dress but I will not try another product from this designer.
1.0,"The website made it seem like it was three pairs, also, the pair was not boxed properly and the wires broken.<br />(I just wrote a review and think it got deleted by mistake."
1.0,Fabric is very light weight and my arms get sunburned through the fabric when I've been out birding. I bought a pair of white sleeves before from the same company any they work fine.
1.0,Was broken in the package. Ordered 5 of them. All broken.
1.0,Too small should've gotten a Large also 3 of the chains were broken....Of course I can see but really would be nice to get what you pay for
1.0,this smelt sooooo bad the instant i opened it. Horrible strong chemical smell. this was sent back as soon as I opened it. Gross!!
1.0,"The winder rotates,it rotates for one hour and stops for three, but doesn't wind the Tag Heuer watch. Don't waist your money."
1.0,"I ordered the XL of this shirt being I wear a 46 in shirts. But, after trying it on to wear it I found that this shirt fits like a small or medium, in kid sizes.<br /><br />By the brand name being ""Dewalt"" I had a reasonable expectation of working ""Men"" clothing sizes in mind while purchasing. But, if this shirt is truly an ""Xtra Large"" then it must be designed for ""Boys"". Although I can't imagine many kids sporting the ""Dewalt"" brand as a fashion statement.<br /><br />After buying this shirt it actually took me over 30 days to finally wear it and by that time I was no longer eligible for a return/refund so I'm stuck with this item that fits like a spandex shirt. I felt no immediate need to try it on upon receiving it because I bought Dewalt pants and button-down shirts before but never had this problem. I always had plenty of room to move around in. So I took for granted it would fit, as the others did fit.<br /><br />If any of you working men out there decide to purchase this item I would advise you to try it on immediately because it has the 'Dewalt"" working men name but in reality, it fits like a boy's kid-size XL."
1.0,Very disappointing. Too big. 5' 133lbs I ordered a small and it was too big
1.0,"wore it one day and it fell apart. guess you get what you pay for. luckily i have some jewelry making supplies and could fix it myself, still not the point though, if i wanted to make one i would have."
1.0,"The shoulders and arms run small and the bottom is HUGE! I thought this would be a nice stand by in case the Gypsy themed outfit I was trying to put together for Celtic Fest didn't work out. This shirt was horrible. It didn't flow. If you have anything larger than a B cup, this shirt will not be flattering on you."
1.0,The fabric is very cheap. Do not recommend!
1.0,Too expensive for a cheap quality. After 1 wash it already looked worn out.
1.0,Broke during use was broken charm on arrival
1.0,"The fit was weird and wonky. These pants have no back tag, in fact, they arrived with no manufacturer tag or stamp at all. With no tag indicating front or back, I tried them both ways. The fit was horrible both ways.<br /><br />There was a bulk of fabric bunched up between my waist and the top of thighs. I think the belt might be sent along to try to hide that awkward bulge of loose unattractive fabric; if so, it is not working.<br /><br />I am 5’2” and  have a flat tummy and rounded butt; hourglass figure. The waist dipped down too  low in the back. Looked awful just standing in front of the mirror but the pants were dangerously low when sitting.<br /><br />There were no tags sent with these pants. They were in a generic zip top bag. No tag on the product. No manufacturer’s  stamp on the inside back.  No wash and wear instructions. There was a tiny white tag half way down the leg with the word  Rayon.<br /><br />The fabric was crisp, scratchy, stiff and not a flowing fabric as shown in the photo.  Even worse, the fabric was sheer, and for modesty I would have had to wear long undies or yoga pants beneath these.... which defeats the purpose of soft, cool, summer outfits.<br /><br />I tried a tunic over the pants and looked six months pregnant. I tried a soft top tucked in and the fabric bulk was still there. There was no way to fix the overall poor design of these  pants.<br /><br />Buyer beware: if you don’t like the fit, the fabric and ask to return, seller deducts $6.00 for shipping from your refund.<br /><br />I do not recommend for all the reasons above."
1.0,Could not unscrew the ball to use. Tried multiple ways but was not made properly. Would not recommend.
1.0,I normally only wear a extra large but I ordered it a 3X to make sure and it’s still too small disappointed in the fit
1.0,"Tail is literally 10” long. It has a small single band of elastic that I guess is supposed to enable you to safety pin it, but would just flop around everywhere, then.. really a bummer! Was supposed to be for a Pink Panther costume, but will be returned instead."
1.0,Very upset about these wings I pulled out them put of the box and they loom NOTHING like the picture. EXTREMELY disappointed as I am going to the renn fest tomorrow
1.0,"If you are looking for the cheapest, see through fabric, you have found it!  It was almost incomprehensible why these could even pass for cotton.  Save your money and time returning them.  They deserved a zero star."
1.0,Broke in about 2 days
1.0,Doesn’t hold up nicely after 1 wash...  looks very worn.
1.0,"Fit is horrible, internal seams are bulky and make the gloves uncomfortable."
1.0,"I got an XL but couldn't even put it on.  It's a very small, tight dress.  My daughter is a size 2 but her taste in clothes is very different than mine so she probably won't want it.  I WANT A REFUND!!"
1.0,I bought a Small- 5'7&#34; and 125lbs. The dress was cut very strange. Bought this in red and black but both has weird top portion. Had to return as it was incredibly unflattering.
1.0,There’s no way this wreath is 18 inches unless they are measuring the tip of the longest leaf sticking out. I have a 20 inch wreath and this looks like a baby compared to it. It’s probably more like 12 inches. It is pretty and sturdy so I decided to keep it instead of returning it.<br /><br />Edited to add - I measured it and it’s 14 inches across. Changed my rating as a result.
1.0,"Cheep cheep cheep, fell apart before I could ever use it. Don’t waist your time or money!"
1.0,"The color , style and size of this bag were perfect for me. Upon arrival of the bag I could smell the bag from inside the carton.I don't know where the bag was stored there was a chemical odor to the bag. Forced to return it."
1.0,"I can’t write a review of the look or fit or feel because this item has taken 2 months to arrive. I’ve pretty much lost hope of it ever getting here. In the meantime the warm summer months are over and we are moving into the prolonged cold, rainy season Seattle is so famous for. Will it arrive in time for next summer? Will I care?"
1.0,"Terrible, went from ladies to children""s pajamas after washing. I threw in the garbage."
1.0,"Very nice shorts but they are way too small.  ""Relaxed Fit"" is not true at all.  I normally wear a 12 but ordered a 14 just to make sure they were comfy.  They are more like a size 10.  They are made very well and I like the fabric but will not be able to wear them.  The seller gave me a partial refund."
1.0,Way small than advertised fuss appointed.
1.0,"Waist fit perfectly.  Groin area was very uncomfortable, and the appearance was both amusing and disturbing.  Size up when purchasing."
1.0,The large fits like a small didn't even go up my knees
1.0,I cannot review this mask for I NEVER RECEIVED IT.
1.0,"Not happy with product, wife has been wearing, and is already starting to turn. Copper color is already showing through"
1.0,The eyeglass frame itself is perfect BUT there's writing on the lens that will not come off. I communicated to the seller and they said that rubbing alcohol would remove the writing. It did not so I cannot wear these frames. I really am disappointed that it did not because I'd intended to purchase another pair in a different color. The featherweight of the frame is a plus. I have not received a communication from the seller about returning this frame or getting a replacement.  KDB
1.0,"This was the most generic hat!!!! It was so thin you could see through it, so yes I can say that it was light weight if that's what you are wanting. But there is no words for how generic this hat was. I sent it back due to such disappointment."
1.0,The sword was paper thin. Plus my son who is 3 had a hard time holding it.
1.0,way too small!!!! and it’s a large and i am a size 10 and i don’t want anything made in china anymore
1.0,Very nice watch.  Loved it.  Glass cracked in 2 weeks.
1.0,The fit was off and the fabric seemed cheap.  I would not recommend this dress if you are trying to build a professional wardrobe.
1.0,"I guess our grandson has chubby feet, because this shoe, although opened very wide, couldn't fit his foot.  I won't necessarily not recommend this shoe, only if your child had wide feet"
1.0,It was ripped about 6 inches at the seam when it arrived.
1.0,Ordered an XXL and im in an XL it still doesnt fit it looks big but fits like an xs
1.0,"I’m not exactly sure we can call these socks.  I mean, they kinda looked like fun socks … but these were NOT socks.  Strips of straight, unstretchable fabric sewn together.  Couldn’t get them past my heel.  After sweating profusely attempting to do so, because I was determined to wear these babies, I quickly realized once I was able to force the “sock” over the heel, it was impossible to pull up!  Zero stretch means no matter how skinny your calf is, these socks will have you believing you’re fat.  Couldn’t get them past my ankle bone!!  I felt like a girl in high school trying hard to get those jeans on that once fit.  The struggle is REAL with this product!!!  Be sure to reserve extra time for the second shower you’ll need after all the sweat and tears, and yes, there will be tears, too, you put in for one sock.  Also remember, now you’ll have to put on the second one!  Holy hell."
1.0,"Purchased for 5 year old: Under skirt WAY to short. Dress portion was long enough, but shorts are required to wear. Had to tuck straps so the dress would stay up properly.<br />Purchased for 2 year old. Straps WAY to big and unable to keep her nipples covered, AFTER tucking it. Under skirt went just below diaper, and dress portion went to her knees."
1.0,Very cheaply made. They don’t fit tight like leggings.
1.0,Loved the colors and I ordered the same size as the purple one and that one did fit but this one did not so I was disappointed but I gave it to my teenager daughter who loves it and it fits her perfect 🤣🙌🏽
1.0,"Runs very small. My wife isn't big by any means, but it barely fit her."
1.0,"Sizing is way off. I measured myself and followed the sizing chart, but the jacket is so small I can't even try it on. Unfortunately I can't speak to the waterproofness or breathability...as the the jacket is so small it is unusable. For reference...I'm 6'2"" and 225 lbs...i bought an XL. I would need a 3XL...which isn't an option. Also, at the time I purchased there were a bunch of reviews, and as of this writing there is only one other review. Seems fishy..."
1.0,"the strap looks nice but it started cracking after a week and when i tried to take it off i couldn't, the little metal tubes prevent me from replacing the strap and i had to rip it off the watch."
1.0,Not as it  look in the pic. Waste of money
1.0,They stopped working after only used 4 days.
1.0,Screws fell out of lenses 2 days after received.<br />DO NOT BUY THESE SUNGLASSES!
1.0,"One star for look, no stars for sizing. All these reviews about how huge they are are from 16 year old girls ordering the L & XL sizes. The XL I ordered & received is around a 12/14 womens, maybe will fit a size 16 if you have thin arms & narrow back. The width from the back from sleeve to sleeve is  very narrow. The arms on the beige one are tighter than the black one.Maybe some run bigger than others but the 3 I got are all the same size but all fit differently and all fit SMALL. If you are over a size 18 I would not order these. I ordered another one from another brand &#34;OLRAIN&#34; in a size LARGE (blue floral pattern), which I was sure wouldn't fit, well it fits perfect! It's more of a batwing pattern but I'd rather have that one that is actually listed as a LARGE but really is a big size & fits."
1.0,The wallet is nice the case is poorly made pieces breaking off daily.
1.0,They are MUCH smaller than I anticipated.  These would be good for small earrings or rings only if you are wanting them for jewelry.
1.0,The structure of this dress was totally old lady.  I use it as a house dress. I wouldn’t even wear this to check my mail.
1.0,TOO CHEAP WON'T LAST
1.0,Belt ripped and  Came apart at the seams In 36 days.
1.0,"Shorts blue Medium, purple and Pink ; mal medidos, piernas de pantalón anchas, cintura ancha abajo sobrando tela, muy ajustado en cintura arriba y torso corto. A shorts disaster returning the 3 of them."
1.0,I returned it... TERRIBLE FABRIC- CHEAP AND ITCHY
1.0,Got a 3x and I  couldn't even get them over my knee. I usually wear a  size 18
1.0,The image of the product on Amazon does not correspond to the product itself.<br />They showed a picture of 24 colorful bracelets and sent 2 plain ones???<br /><br />False advertisement.
1.0,Seams not sewn correctly.
1.0,A 2x is a US size 12...?????  That's what showed up.
1.0,It could not hold the weight of the phone and fell apart immediately
1.0,I can appreciate every denim can have variation however Denim color was no where close to picture<br />Super washed out and seems like cheap material. Does not look like photo presented for purchase.<br />Fit was true to size and liked the stretch in the material
1.0,So disappointed. The first time wearing it and the birthstone came off. Didn't know it was missing until taking it off. I have others I purchased elsewhere and haven't had a problem. 🤔
1.0,"I was hoping this necklace would work, but it didn't.  It showed I only walked 40 steps in a 13 hour shift.  I think the problem is that it might hang too low.  I might try to make some adjustments to it, but I am pretty disappointed."
1.0,Has a white under lining material that shows through.
1.0,Was not really how dress was described
1.0,"Unfortunately, this adorable romper didn't work for me.  I can't say if it was too big or too small.  It seems like the whole garment was cut incorrectly.  I guess I got what I paid for."
1.0,"Would not buy again, could never get the wrinkles out of it after washing and steaming. Material is very thin, lots of string left loose on all buttons."
1.0,On its way
1.0,I purchased an xlarge for myself it came in and was nothing of the sort. I gave it to my teen daughter instead it fits her nice but she's no xlarge she's a medium.
1.0,The hinges were broken when we received it.
1.0,"This came really, really late direct from China. Opening the package revealed an incredibly strong chemical smell, most likely from whatever they use to color it a slightly tan/reddish color. It looks decently made, so I put it in the wash. It smells like normal cotton, but the tan/reddish color washed out and stuck to all my other non-black laundry. Not happy with this at all, straight into the trash it goes.<br /><br />Do not buy."
1.0,I don't like it. It was a tore in the money holding part. I tried to fix it and it didn't work.
1.0,"The color is not aqua, but deep blue different than picture& still blurry"
1.0,Something off with the way this dress was made.
1.0,"Order 6 of these straps with strap pad, and pick holder. Got 6 strap pads, no straps.  Replaced order. Same thing. Just pads. To bad, as complete looks great. Weird."
1.0,Poor quality. Poor color. Disappointing.
1.0,Posts were broken...very disappointed
1.0,the charm changes colors
1.0,Mask wasn't what we expected but overall great customer service
1.0,Several Arrived broken
1.0,Total Junk!! I wish I could rate them at a zero! I can see better if I take the glasses off. They didn't send a receipt with the package and no directions for sending them back.  Please do not waste your time or money ordering these worthless glasses.
1.0,"This bag is too small to be called Big Budda,I was disappointed,returned it."
1.0,"The product I received has yellow stripes on the sleeve and collar instead of the black shown. Further, I am not sure what material is used to make the shirt, however it feels very much like a shower curtain."
1.0,Cheaply made and strange material
1.0,There isn't anything I liked about this product. I tried to return it and they say they are unreturnable. A pair of shoes it's not right. It doesn't even deserve a one-star. If you buy a product you should be able to return it within the 30-day period.
1.0,"The color (lilac) is gorgeous, but these earrings are too heavy to wear! I have three other pairs of threadball earrings from a different maker and they're very lightweight."
1.0,Way to small I'm a medium ordered the black one omg I'm on offer up selling it way to small ... Bought the black one
1.0,Cheap. Broke after 1 use.
1.0,This item is different then it appears. Do not like it.
1.0,"This was in no way surgical steel. I had a horrible allergic reaction. On top of that, the clasp is trash. Seriously do not buy this. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1.0,zippers are not smooth. look is good.
1.0,"I really looked forward to the arrival of this pair summer pants. They looked comfortable and lightweight. Quite stylish!  When the package arrived  ( from a return center), I had no idea what it was. Style-wise, the pants looked nothing like the photo or the description. The pants were VASTLY undersized. I’m going to try to return them.  This was just not what I expected."
1.0,Cheap thin
1.0,I wear adult large in T-shirt’s and this hoodie fits like a child’s hoodie
1.0,"This purse is small and it smells weird. The edges are rough as well. The worst part though, is that it is a HUGE pain to unbuckle and buckle back. It is not meant to be a daily purse that you would be in and out of. I suggest this as part of a costume or as decoration. I was very disappointed."
1.0,Very disappointed!  No instructions to send back.
1.0,very low grade stones no sparkle looks dull and fake returned it !
1.0,Please look at the sizing chart! The size chosen fit small...This dress is not true to size. I'm sure it fits someone. But not me!
1.0,Eye fell off in the first wash and started to rip. Cheaply made
1.0,Terrible and cheap
1.0,"I was really excited to get these yoga pants. But, was very disappointed. The stitching is weird and heavy, and in stands out. The color was off. I bought black leggings, but in the light there strange spots."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!! I've received the item yesterday and the rings didn't came! I just have the empty mini pocket.
1.0,"Great in concept, but the black plastic clips are very flimsy and keep breaking off. In a month I have lost 4--and this with only Vera Bradley (cloth) bags hanging from them. Strongly recommend against."
1.0,"It's so thin it's practically see through. No webs no spiders no ""boo"". Completely different color orange! Unbelievably awful! So disappointed!! Also took forever to arrive especially with shipping. Not even worth the price of shipping. Negative 4 stars!"
1.0,"Have ordered these twice.<br />1) In the first order, one of the little shackle bolts had stripped threads and was useless.<br />2) In the second order, several of the compasses were loose on the clasp and I had to clean the gunk off the backs, and super glue them back on. 1 of the compasses was even completely loose in the little bag they come in. In addition to that, the compasses sit into such a shallow depression on the clasp, that I suspect anyone wearing a bracelet with this clasp will knock the compass off of it in a short time, If the sides of the depression were deep enough to where they rose up to the top of the compass, they might survive a bit longer.<br />3) The finishes on 2 clasps in the second order were so rough and flawed, that I would never send them to one of my customers. I just threw them away.<br />4) Today (8/9/17) I got 2 calls from customers stating these clasps were turning their skin green. One only had his on for 3 days when it started. I will replace those bracelets at my expense because unlike these people, I stand behind what I sell!<br />Conclusion: There is no quality control in the packing and shipping of these clasps."
1.0,So cheap for kids
1.0,Not very cute like you would think they would be :(
1.0,It is cheap and not what is described. It is a clear piece of glass with a yin/yang sign glued to the back. I wish i had the bag to return it. Use Etsy for quality products.
1.0,Very weird straps too long and fitting is just weird
1.0,"Total waste of money - the quality and thickness were much poorer than expected. My daughter wears a uniform skirt for school, so she needed something warm for recess in the winter months. These tights weren't any better than the regular cotton tights that I've purchased for half the price. Worse yet, these tights run extremely small. My daughter is 10 years old and average height. Even though I ordered a size up (size 12-14), the crotch of the tights was midway between her hip and knees. I might as well have thrown my money in the trash.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews, the size and quality might be OK for toddlers. However, these are not big enough for school-age girls or warm enough to wear outside for prolonged periods of time."
1.0,"Made from very thin material.  Worse yet, the embroidered letters are only on one end of the scarf."
1.0,The dress is incredibly unflattering and itchy and hot. It came missing the hat. The glove was cheap and too big for my hand
1.0,It was allright untill one day I seen the buck head was allmost coming off.But besides that I thought  it was pretty cool
1.0,Fell apart after the first wear.  The knitting came undone at the top of the mitten and completely unraveled.  I returned for a refund and purchased a different brand.  : (
1.0,"The quality and detail on the dress was not as shown in the picture, and it did not fit to my liking. When returned, only half the money was reimbursed. I would not buy from them again nor would I recommend anyone else to purchase from this dishonest company."
1.0,Cheap and useless. Don't bother.
1.0,Disappointed in color. I liked the aqua blue color in the picture but the band I received was a blue - darker than a royal but not quite navy.<br />I had ordered this for my daughter for Christmas but this band is too masculine.
1.0,You get what you pay for. Most were too small to be useful and the zipper broke on two within a couple of days.
1.0,As soon as i put it on it turned my finger green and itchy.
1.0,"The engraving is not as dark as it appears online. My niece found this ring on line and asked for it for her birthday.  She was very disappointed to see that you couldn't even see the engraving unless you held the ring right up to your eye.  She wanted others to be able to see the scripture on her finger. It just looks like a plain silver band when she's wearing it.  Maybe others already mentioned that in their reviews but I didn't do my research prior to buying and should have, shame on me."
1.0,"colors bled all over my sweater,"
1.0,Received a broken chain.
1.0,"If you do not have a curvier shape or a body that looks really good in simple clothing this is not the dress for you. I put it on and it was horrible, it did nothing for my body. You could always wear a belt with it but that might make it look ugly."
1.0,It says goodbay instead of goodbye. So disappointed.
1.0,"The size is on the small side, the fabric is like a satin taffeta, not usual slip material. It clings and is static-y -defeats the purpose of using it as a slip. Would not buy again."
1.0,Cute but it looks homemade and cheap. I could see the stitches in the hair piece.
1.0,"Very disappointed with the company, I ordered two pairs the first ones I ordered were perfect fit and coverage they were thick and not see through. I loved them so much I went back to order a second pair, now when my second pair came in it was a surprise. My second pair was so see through and thin they were horrible like cheap bad material. I called their customer service number and all the lady could tell me was to return the bad pair order a new one and hope for the best. I asked why they would be different and her response was that they order from different factory's and they all have different materials so not every pair is the same. I think that's why the reviews are so mixed. Feel free to test your luck to see if you get a good material one or a cheap one from one of their bad factories. Very disappointed I thought this was going to be my new go to leggings but I don't have the time to test and return and re-buy to try to get lucky with a good pair. As a side note I ordered they're black capri leggings."
1.0,"Sizing is not accurate,  Definitely not made for plus size women.  Bust is extremely small and the bra liner is about the size of a B cup if that."
1.0,Fell on the floor once and broke
1.0,Not breathable! Gives you a rash in the heat!
1.0,Dissappointed at how small shirt was and it shrunk up in washer/dryer
1.0,This bag looks very cheaply made I am very disappointed in the quality of it. It doesn't even look like it is worth on a rack at Kmart. Do not waste your time
1.0,"Don’t even waste your money, it broke in the process of me trying to put it on & I just got this yesterday.. what a disappointment… Amazon do better"
1.0,Wash them according to instructions and the champion logo washed off on the first wash smh. I DO NOT recommend them.
1.0,"Is not as pictured at all.  The design is blown up and ugly, and does not look like picture.  Also, not true to size, made small.  Going back!"
1.0,After 4-5 uses...my toes go through...i get a pedicure every 4 weeks! Found them very disappointing
1.0,If I could give it zero stars I would... cheap and flimsy doesn't work.
1.0,"It looked cool. Was the right price. I work out a normal amount (5-6 days/week). The entire thing is now rusted.  The magnets, the weave of metal.  Everything"
1.0,"Sent me a completely different product first, had to send back- cheap material, much higher neckline than pictured, will never be able to get wrinkles out bc of material, going to try to return."
1.0,"The description says they are polarized lenses. I contacted the company because they are not to ask if this was a defect. They responded asking why I thought they were not polarized and I told them the difference between lenses but they never responded. The frames are also cheap plastic and not very flexible at the hinge so they can break easily if you are not careful. For blocking out the sun, they are decent. Not worth $10 or purchasing. And the company doesn’t help. Buy other sunglasses."
1.0,What a bummer. There was no corset in the package. Returning it tomorrow.
1.0,Color and the quality way too off.<br />The material all stretched out as if someone already worn and washed it.<br />Nothing like the picture at all. Not happy .
1.0,The decent share definitely folds up to a nice heated back it has a grip bottom but does not have the strap to strap it to the bleacher and it's a bit thin on the padding so I found I had to put a blanket on it to make it feel comfy to sit in. It does have a wide base so if it's myself which is a larger person and my wife which is a midsize person and my kids with your small so it is convenient in that respect. But ultimately I had to give it one star based on the fact that it did not come with the bleacher strap to made it difficult to lean back in without toppling backwards. Very frustrating to order something and not have it come the way it was described.
1.0,I bought a dress similar to this one and loved it so I thought I'd try again. I returned this dress immediately. It was sheer and transparent.
1.0,"First of all I received 5 bonnets instead of 6. At first, I thought that maybe the deal was for a pack of 5. When I reviewed my order it says that it was supposed to be a pack of 6. They sent me all of the colors except of the black one. None of the buttons on these caps are as shown. I bought them just because my ears are hurting by the mask, but the placement of the buttons in those are so far off that the cap cannot hold the mask properly in your ears. Ohhh, if you have lots of hair they do not cover all of your hair or at least the ones that I received did not. I will be returning them for a refund. It was a waste of time. I could have go to the uniforms store and get them."
1.0,The wallet is nice but the money clip stinks it slides in and out of the wallet . i stoped using it I. Felt like I was going to loose my money
1.0,After washing before wearing it came out with strings hanging and also fit odd.
1.0,XXL is more like a 14
1.0,I will have to give these one star. The description says faux pearl but it is just a plastic ball. There's not even any sheen. Seriously a plastic ball. I bought them for a gift but cannot give these to anyone.
1.0,"I used this product for my ears. I had to glue one of them, because it came broke."
1.0,"Tooo big, item was way bigger than spected. Occording to comments."
1.0,"​Could NOT get dress over my shoulders, and I have  petite frame, BIG disappointed"
1.0,The clasp was broken on one and the other won’t open at all. It was an easy return though.
1.0,"These are NOT flattering! Im on 5'3 and 110lbs and these shorts made me took 3 month pregnant. After taking 3 months to arrive, I'm trying to return and the seller is asking ME to pay return shipping cost!"
1.0,"This is the cheapest, poorest quality excuse for a jacket I’ve ever seen."
1.0,I normally wear a 3X but ordered a 4X to be safe and it’s way too small. It’s also very thin material. Too bad bcz it is really cute.
1.0,Sizing is way off on this. If you're busty AT ALL you're better off looking elsewhere
1.0,Cup size way off.
1.0,Product fit is way too small. I ordered my usual size xl. These look like they would fit sm.-med.
1.0,Don’t buy not the right size
1.0,I had it for 2 months and is broken now<br />Bad quality
1.0,Don’t
1.0,"What a rip off.<br />Either I don't know my measurements, or this was falsely advertised, but over $5 for just ONE of these?! You don't get three, you only get one, and it's tiny!<br />Cyber robbery."
1.0,Impossible to fit without shredding the receiving holes for the spring bars. The tolerances on the parts are way too tight. I broke 2 tools trying to pry the spring bars into the holes and still failed. Why are they made so much tighter than the original bracelet connections? Maddening.
1.0,This is so cheap that I cant even get it on. Sad because I thought it was so cute and the clasp broke right away. Very disappointed in the product and company for selling something so cheap.
1.0,I returned this item. It's fabric texture is similar to a nylon/polyester blend and I was expecting a regular standard cotton sweatshirt.
1.0,All 3 different fitment.  Terrible . Wast of time and money.
1.0,Poor quality and look cheap.. I don't like it
1.0,So small I couldn’t get them past mid-hip.
1.0,Too big returned
1.0,"I don't even want to give it 1 start , this was crap"
1.0,his broke after about a week and later on i dumped him
1.0,"Bought 4, 3 worked. Very low quality. No confidence in the other 3. Didn't realize from China when purchased."
1.0,This back wasn’t comfortable to me
1.0,Material is cheap and pulls easily.
1.0,This was way smaller then I expected...a normal walet would barley fit
1.0,Just received and both are missing the filter sleeve so useless :(
1.0,Ordered a medium. Top is way too small. Pants fit ok though.
1.0,No where near the size it says it was! Horrible
1.0,"Item is way too small, not at all the color shown. The dress was half coral half bright pink and extremely see through. Returning. Very unpleased."
1.0,"I liked this band, and spent a good amount of time removing links to make it fit, and am so disappointed after I tried to put it on my watch this morning to discover it had broken, and I only used it once. One of the little bumper/catches that are on the part that attaches to the watch face broke and only a little spring is left sticking out of the hole."
1.0,"Needed for 3 day music festival, held rain gear, sweatshirt and phone charger and battery, thick plastic, durable and comfortable to wear. Great purchase"
1.0,Only received 1.... wish that info was in the heading.<br />Should have read reviews.... thats how i found out ....<br />Too late now
1.0,Package was damaged and glass window had scratches. Stopped working after a week. Disappointed!
1.0,It was not the album shown I received an early version the record sounds terrible the cover is ripped ...not happy
1.0,Used it for a little while but the edges on this band are sharp! The release for the clasp also became loose and my band started to come off easily while doing activities. I ended up switching back to an old band I already had.
1.0,"My son loves this leggings and this brand. However, I paid extra for the “fire ball” design on the knee of the legging. Instead I got a plain pair of leggings. The leggings are fine overall and I’d buy them again but my son is mad because he wanted the designed ones. However, he’d already opened and worn them before we realized what had happened."
1.0,They broke very easy
1.0,The magnified area is inconsistent and you cannot focus. Moving your head is like looking through a fishbowl.  These should not be sold on Amazon
1.0,Ordered a size 7 toddler.  Too small.  Bought the same shoe from different company and that shoe fits perfectly.  No shoe size labeling on the box or shoe.  Returned it.
1.0,Couldn't get my foot in 😕
1.0,"When I buy a belt I want to wear it pretty much every day for at least several years.  This one started to come apart after five months - the backing split, then pulled away from the leather - and was unusable in under seven months.  According to my Amazon order history, I ordered this one 1/18/2021 and ordered a ""real"" (Dockers) belt 8/6/2021.  The Dockers belt (B00NJRUJZC ) is still in service, no sign of trouble at all, 4/8/2022.  It doesn't have a bill pocket, but it also isn't disintegrating!<br /><br />Somehow L.L. Bean was capable of selling great money belts for decades, but somehow I can't find a usable one since they exited that market.  This ITAY belt sure didn't fit the bill (so to speak)."
1.0,We ordered the correct size a 38mm but one side of the band was to big and didn’t fit the watch.  Super cute though
1.0,Looks like yellow circle with tiny orange dots. Not noticeable to be pizza at all
1.0,"I believe it was the 4th or 5th time i was wearing it, it just smapped... not what i was hoping for ..."
1.0,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc protocol discourages wearing any items that could be soiled. Please don’t buy your friends or family Alpha socks, underwear, golf club rags,..."
1.0,"Not impressed, bought for my daughter to wear to a funeral. The neckline was not sewn correctly and the fabric did not wash well. No time to order something different or send back."
1.0,"I was disappointed with the product. The dress is actually a bright orange (not at all the warm red that is depicted in the picture). In addition, it seems to run rather small... But even if it fit, it would be going back due to the color (bright orange is not a shade I would ever wear)."
1.0,Had to return watch... Product said water resistance  but not water proof...My grandson wore it in the sprinkler which should have be safe but it was not...Steamed right up...was able to return...Don't waste you money
1.0,This top was very pretty when it arrived however upon fitting it did not cover my small breasts as the opening is too large and ill shaped. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,Too big for iPhone 7plus that’s it you want to use a case! It bubbles up and doesn’t stick completely. Then after a week it chips! Don’t waste ur money!
1.0,"The product arrived within two days, thanks to Prime, however it appeared already broken. The necklace itself is beautiful and would have gone perfectly with the outfit I needed it for. I'm left in a bind to find another necklace and earring set before the weekend, as I am speaking to a large group and wanted this as a statement piece."
1.0,Wasn't thrilled with these.  I love the way they look but in two days after wearing them the nose pieces broke. The quality isn't there. Very disappointed in how cheap they seem. Wouldn't buy them again. Got some better ones at target for the same price and they're sturdier.
1.0,"They hurt and are extremely uncomfortable to wear I totally regret the purchase bc they just sit in my jewelry box un-utilized, wasted money."
1.0,"So pretty, loved the look, but as many reviewers have stated: way too small! Since we read that beforehand, we actually went up 2 sizes instead of 1, and even though our daughter has a narrow foot, she still couldn't squeeze these on!"
1.0,Poor quality doesn’t really match photo picture.
1.0,Quality over all is bad
1.0,I had to return these because the seam by the zipper wasn't sown.  It came apart when it got stretched.
1.0,Same thing happens before
1.0,"ordered as a lightweight rain repellent while walking, jogging, biking, or every day use during fall / spring in a warmer humid climate. i have only tried on the coat at this point and am returning. the jacket is way too warm, jacket does not breathe, and outer shell is cheaply made and ""loud"". jacket would be too sweaty in 40° through 60° environment. the ""loud"" part of the description is related to the material. on the plus side, the orange is very bright. i've attached a pic with the flash turned on in a dark room to highlight the reflective stripes. jacket is sized appropriate - i bought an XL"
1.0,You definitely get your monies worth. Necklace is very cheaply made and looking. Charm is ok. Never again
1.0,"The quality of these tap shoes is terrible. We previously purchased Theatricals tap shoes and loved them, the quality and fit were perfect. Unfortunately Theatricals didn’t have the next size up when we needed it. We bought these in a size 10.5 and they are the same size as the size 9’s in the theatricals, so not a true size 10.5. Way too small for my boys. Also the quality is very, very poor."
1.0,"It has NO cash slot for cash or checks, and the card slots are so small once cards were put in - they didn't come out easily at all. I can deal with card slots, they would stretch out eventually. But no cash slot?! It's a WALLET. :( Otherwise really cute, returning..."
1.0,I ordered a xl and a 2 xl and the xl was bigger than the 2 xl and they are both sized wrong. The xl look to be a size 8 in Jr’s and the 2 xl fits like a 6 in jr’s<br />NOT USA SIZES
1.0,Don't waste your money if your plus sized. I'm a size 14 and I bought an XXXL and the robe will doesn't close.
1.0,Back of the ear rings are white
1.0,"They we’re to short, to small, and see through."
1.0,The bracelet is cute but unfortunately the ring that holds the brackets of the bracelet together broke with in a week of wearing. I was very disappointed
1.0,This is completely see-through. Do not recommend.
1.0,Just received it today it looks nothing like the picture it look like it should cost $5 awful nothing like what it I expected is something very off from the picture absolutely do not buy!!!!
1.0,They closed for a week and after that they kept opening up and my daughter lost one because of that and the other broke off of her .. Never again will buy these cheap earrings ...
1.0,These flower charms are so pretty & colorful but they do not fit snake charm bracelets which I found very disappointing. I had to return them b/c they didn't fit on the bracelet I'm making for my step mom's birthday. Too bad. I really wanted to add color and use the flowers as spacers on the charm bracelet.
1.0,"Disgustingly small! I am 5'6 and 130 pounds and the medium hardly buttoned on me. Even if it did, it is way too short for anyone over 5'5. I would not recommend buying this product unless you are petite."
1.0,"We got this bag to use as our son's ""on the go"" bag for his diabetic emergency supplies. Pack it, grab it and go, only getting into it as needed or to restock. The size and layout were great. Perfect for his kit and a few snacks. One zipper pull came off on the second outing. One of the main zippers completely busted in less than two weeks despite the fact that nothing was overpacked and there was no strain on the zipper. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"I was washing my gaiter today so I can start wearing it to work this week. When I started whirling it around in the water, the water started turning brown. Mind you, the color I bought was dark blue and black. (This is straight out of the package. I haven't even tried it on, now I'm really glad I haven't). I will be returning this as I won't feel comfortable wearing it even after washing it."
1.0,Does not fit Oakley inmates!
1.0,I have had other jewelry from Mariell. But these are very very cheap looking. I might get away with wearing them at night. Or in the dark.  Should be  $5.00
1.0,"Thin cheap material bought two and one was mis sown along the seam, waste of money."
1.0,"I bought these at a great price however my son and I used them for the first time and underwater they were ""BLURRY"" above water they were crystal clear. I'm not sure if ours were just defective but will update review after I contact the company.  Our old googles were clearer underwater"
1.0,Dislike t  by is. Material very scratchy and itchy cannot wear it at all<br />It looks cute<br />But I won’t even try to wear it
1.0,Material was terrible and so was fit.
1.0,These pants are not as advertised at all. They are paper thin and see through!!! I bought them for work but they are sitting on the shelf can’t be worn at all. If there were zero stars I would give it to them.
1.0,"the size is larger than normal, they are uncomfortable, the safety cap seems to affect the thermity of the foot and makes it more uncomfortable"
1.0,VERY CHEAP !!!!!  THE KIND OF JUNK YOU WOULD FIND AT A PENNY ARCADE GAME AND THE COMPANY OR AMAZON WILL NOT TAKE RETURN ONLY IN STORE CREDIT SO YOU CAN GET MORE CHEAP JUNK!!!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0,Like I said it wasn't real moldavite but I did like the necklace
1.0,"First of all, the product description claims these boots are made of suede.  Suede is leather.  There is no leather involved in the making of these boots,  They are entirely synthetic, and they smell like plastic.  The photo in the listing is just blurry enough so that you can't really tell, but trust me, in person these are fake micro-suede, and cheap stuff at that.  Second of all, they're very weirdly shaped.  It's as if they weren't designed to really be worn on feet.  The shaft is far too straight and narrow for the size of the foot which is really really wide, but the instep is so low it's really hard to even pull these boots on.  It's like they were made for kids or something...kids with stick legs and wide flat duck feet.  I even ordered a size up from my normal size and still there's just no way these actually fit on the feet of normal humans.<br /><br />I've bought boots like these before.  Usually they're cheap but ok...I like them.  They're fine for wearing around the house.  I really expected these to be nothing more than cute slipper-boots, but they're not even that.  Plus, I paid way too much for them.  If you pay more than $10, you've paid way too much, and I paid over twice that amount.  You can buy these same boots, made better, at your corner catch-all store for half this price and NO shipping and NO month-long wait.  I'm ok with waiting a long time for good, artisan-made, high quality stuff.  But waiting a month to get a plastic bag of junk in the mail really hurts.<br /><br />Unwearable AND basically, unreturnable.  Because just try to send stuff back to China...good luck.  When will I learn?  No matter how cute it seems, if it ships from China, it's cheap fake knockoff junk.  Sorry China.  You make junk, and loads of it.  Shame on you.  Shame on me for buying it."
1.0,I didn’t like the watch it didn’t work properly at all it wouldn’t charge I got so upset I put it in the trash my baby was so sad and hurt because she really wanted it but it was no good very disappointed
1.0,"Itchy as hell, the inside of the pants just isn’t comfortable, I have to wear thermals just so it stops itching. They are very baggy and they do make noise when walking. I’m not sure about the durability yet. I do like the pockets but still itchy asf!!!<br />UPDATE: the durability of the waterproof is awful. I did manage to make the pants from itching my washing the pants probably five times or so. Still love all the pockets. But seriously there is better pants out there but this one is not it."
1.0,"I can't believe I fell for this! The material is the cheapest I have ever felt. Walmart has better quality scrubs than these ! What a scam the picture is NOTHING like the scrubs that were delivered. Color is completely wrong, and texture will cut up your skin! Don't bother buying from here"
1.0,These have a chemical odor. Can't use.
1.0,Cracked Handle and a no return policy
1.0,For the price I was expecting better quality. It’s completely see through and the turning red logo had imperfections.
1.0,These are super comfortable. If you are looking for comfort these are great. They are really shiny though and I was hoping for more of slacks look than a workout pant look since I need them for work.
1.0,when I opened the box it started off-gassing toxic fumes.  not sure if that will go away
1.0,I liked the purple color but returned the product because the smell of the case was so noxious it nearly made me sick.<br />Not a good choice!
1.0,The color pattern..it arrived and got it a size bigger because i wanted it to hang and wrap with a belt to my surprise it was 2 sizes 2 small i could not even put my arm in it...
1.0,Very bad quality !!☹️☹️☹️
1.0,"Wasn't pleased with the necklace, looked tarnished"
1.0,I would advise every online buyer not to purchase this product... total waste of money
1.0,this runs small
1.0,Total disappointment worth only 5$. Item is not at all as it looks in pics.
1.0,Did not come with emblem.
1.0,Does not pull down over head for coverage of ears. I will pass this along to my grandson 1 and a half years old because of the misleading Title of this item and details. No man would fit this unless they had a child's size head. Plus the ribs in the fabric- there are 6- are what the one review said pretty ridiculous looking in other words.
1.0,I bought it too small!
1.0,Very pretty but a little gawdy for me to wear. Will have to be very careful what I wear them with.
1.0,Item was described to have two magnets built into the band and all of the photos show two magnets. The band I received only had one magnet and one of the attachment pieces doesn’t have any band to it. It’s just a loop that the other band goes through.
1.0,These things won't stay together at all. You can't fit 2 pieces of photo paper in them anyway. I returned these.
1.0,"It feels like folding cardboard. I can’t believe this cost as much as it did. Total rip off, don’t waste your money. The hassle to return it makes it even more annoying"
1.0,This is the second watch band like this that I bought. Both broken for no reason and just fell off of my arm. The most recent DESTROYED my Apple Watch 2. Screen came off. Don’t buy this!!!!!
1.0,"I didn’t even get what I ordered. I got two bathrobes of the same size, for a small child (I ordered one for a 10 year old).  I also didn’t even get the unicorn one at all. I got an LOL doll themed one, so this Christmas present was very upsetting for my niece.  She was so happy for the cute one I ordered."
1.0,The logo is a silk screen not an embroidered patch.  Cheap!
1.0,The measurements given put me in a 2x. I ordered the 4x to be on the safe side. Too small. Sizing is not accurate.
1.0,I was excited to try this...but it doesn't stay in place it rolls up or down just like every other waste trainer that claims to have good results...I gotta return it unfortunately
1.0,It doesn't fit correct. I don't why this product is sold. I'm surprised it has two stars. Its can't fit correctly. S8 phone can't have tampered glass screen protector as the phone is curved. Only normal screen protector will work.
1.0,"Don’t buy, it’s made horribly. I asked to return this item and seller never responded. I only rated it a 1 because I had no other option"
1.0,Arm fell off out of no where.
1.0,Fit like a garbage bag. Or a potato sack. A truly shapeless garment in every way that matters. Also the neckline is higher and also shapeless.
1.0,vuarnet only uses glass lenses with a v etched into them
1.0,"Very cheaply made, not sure it could hold a book without breaking"
1.0,"This product is advertised, and shown in pictures, with an elastic band attached with a plastic button. The product I received came with a plastic strip with slots to fit the ends together around your head. There is not an elastic band and you have to put the shield together yourself.  As a medical professional I cannot see this configuration giving correct fit or staying in place properly."
1.0,Really bummed out. I bought these for the swirly pair and literally wore them for an hour before the ball/backing fell off. Now I can't wear them and I gave the other two pairs as a gift.
1.0,Nice suit but wish the top fit
1.0,broke the first day
1.0,Didn't fit... looked horriable. Also said they couldn't return... have no understanding why .
1.0,"As soon as I opened it I knew it would be too small - looked like it was made for a child.  I measured the circumference and it was 20"" around - I'm 30"" around and wear a 34B (and am slender too) so I thought the medium would be fine.  Returned it without trying it on as I knew I couldn't get it over my head."
1.0,The fabric rolls on the ends - looks very cheap.
1.0,one of the seams was not well sewn in the lace up part so the one time I wore this is fell apart and was embarrassing while dancing
1.0,"Doesn't sit right, very heavy material, and is bout a foot too long. The straps are also very loose. Pictures to follow. I will be returning. I ordered a small and I'm 5'7 and a solid 137 lbs and very athletic. Not happy about this dress."
1.0,No me gusto el color ya que se ve diferente a la presentada
1.0,The leather was peeling as soon as I open the box.
1.0,"Got it in the mail today, went to put it on..and the clasp broke. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone planning on wearing it."
1.0,Liked it runs very small had to mail it back.
1.0,This product was too small for a 7year’s head. I was disappointed.
1.0,These socks were too small for me and I wear a size 8.5 shoe. I think these were made to fit children not adults.  It’s too bad because they’re really cute.
1.0,They only one trip to the pool
1.0,This is a 3 leaf clover with the top leaf cut in half.  lol  lame.
1.0,Not my style.  Hat is too soft.
1.0,The sizes run way to small and I went through hell to try and send them back.
1.0,My husband just opened this watch last night and wore it to work today. He has an office job so not hitting his wrist or hands. It just broke off his wrist while at work.  He loved the style but now his Christmas gift is ruined.
1.0,Cheap material. Glittery material not same as pictured.
1.0,Not a fan at all. It’s runs very small and the fabric is like compression on steroids. Made my boobs flat and falling out at the same time. Not a fan. I would order a size or too up. I am a 38 C so yea lol.
1.0,The leopard print is ugly! It looks like orange leopard. I will return it. Very disappointed
1.0,I expected great quality and it was terrible. I have bought many Polo items and they have never been like this. The while outfit was way too small and cheap looking.
1.0,I ordered this toe ring as the first one I ordered was perfect.  This new one I received is tarnished and in no way is the quality of the other one purchased and likely not .925. I will be returning.
1.0,I do not like the material- very synthetic and not soft
1.0,Very sturdy.<br />I love the length.<br />Then it turns gray and green when you perspire
1.0,"Super soft material, but the dress was cut in a very weird way. The pockets were high on the torso, almost under the breast area, and the dress was way longer on me than pictured. The ratio of skirt to top of the dress was wrong. Had to return it because it was very unflattering."
1.0,The fit is unflattering. I ordered XS and the top portion was oddly proportioned. Then with the broken strap right out of the bag I'm very unimpressed!
1.0,The main zipper broke within 8 days. The stitching has come undone on the front pocket. I am hoping to return for a refund. I will post the outcome when I know. Very disappointed.
1.0,Broke after 2nd wear!
1.0,Had to send it back. It runs very small even though it says extra-large
1.0,"First off, it's not a hoodie. It's a windbreaker with a hood. It's made of polyester and feels like an itchy recycled trash bag.<br />Second, the very first time I decided to see if it's actually a good windbreaker, the zipper broke.<br />You get what you pay for, which is why this is the cheapest."
1.0,The product description on the website says that the fabric has Cotton. The label on the item indicates the there is no cotton in it. Check attached photo of the label. The T-Shirt clings to the body due to the fabric content.
1.0,Daughter picked her size based on the guidelines and these shorts were much too small. She couldn't get them up over her thighs.
1.0,Solo sirve la lente negra ...los demás lentes vienen muy gruesos y no los puedes poner en la montura
1.0,"This arrived in a different color, wrinkled and of very poor quality. I advise you not to buy from this company."
1.0,I was disappointed in this purse.  It is very pretty but the clasp would not stay closed.  The seller allowed me to return the item and refunded my money without any hassle.
1.0,Broke the first wear
1.0,"Doesn't lock on to watch, waste of money."
1.0,It fell apart after an entire 5 minutes.
1.0,"So many things here just weren’t right.  It ran not just a little too big, but way too big.  The dimensions of the entire thing make me wonder if Saru from ST Discovery was the model for this.<br /><br />The material is so thin a ship traveling with a spore drive could move right through it.  Definitely not appropriate for my teenage daughter to be showing the world all of her undergarments<br /><br />Don’t waste your time and money.  You will just return it right away like I did"
1.0,Not what I expected..very small and bubble gum machine quality
1.0,These are just rubbery and don't stay in place like the original one did
1.0,Very little compression. They feel like extra long socks.
1.0,Always order a size up! My thighs are to thick for the white fishnet shorts I ordered and I don’t see a return address. Never again
1.0,Very cheap quailty don’t buy anyone ….wast of money
1.0,"I liked the look of this watch a lot then the first one came and the clock hands weren’t in the correct orientation. Something I couldn’t change ( meaning it would never actually be able to tell the correct time !!!) then they had sent me a second one and this was working fine until the day I went swimming with it , it had water leak inside !! Luckily it hasn’t stopped working but it is bothersome seeing the condensation built up inside . You get what you pay for I guess !!"
1.0,Very narrow shoes for my little ones feet - He didn't even wear them once :(
1.0,The laces broke within a week of use and the breakage occurred during normal tying.
1.0,does not work at all  with nubuck timberlands or lugz
1.0,Too big and way too short
1.0,"Fit was great, look was great, but it feels like paper. It’s thin and crunchy and not at all what I’d expect any article of clothing to feel like. I slapped on a pair of French braids and embraced my inner housewife on the prairie look and tried to love it because it was cheap, but it sucks."
1.0,The short is HUGE. Looks like a 2XL
1.0,Not thick enough.<br />sheerness around the neck & it's cute & feminent.
1.0,Zipper broke after the first use.
1.0,Glasses came with a blue light test area that is suppose to turn colors with out the glasses and not turn colors with the glass and it turned colors like I didn't even have the glasses on 🤦
1.0,I bought the size as instructed by Amazon. It was so big my 6ft 200 pound husband could fit in it with room to spare. Sending it back.
1.0,DO NOT LIKE HOW IT FITS
1.0,This product is very thin and does not run true to size - runs small.
1.0,But the size was too small. I purchased a plus size and I shoulda got a size larger then what actually am. It is so tight I can’t breathe. Will be returning
1.0,Poor quality. Made with synthetic fabric not really helmet. Inaccurate description on the website.
1.0,"This item is total crap. I've owned 3 pairs in the last 3 years - fool on me for buying them - and almost on schedule, they literally break in half after about a year of normal use. The plastic is so cheap I think it's got more holes than substance in it. These glasses aren't even worth $5.00. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"First of all this isn’t a sweatshirt it’s a long sleeve t shirt with a good, incredibly thin material and secondly it’s very small, I ordered a 1X and this is more like a medium"
1.0,Hated it... returned right away. color is off. the white seem dingy. THe purse is rigid and look cheap.
1.0,The print looks nicer in the picture than in person. The fabric is scratchy and uncomfortable. I have to wear it with a cami. I am never wearing this again.
1.0,"I've had this for about a week now and have worn them every day since I received them to test them out. Unfortunately, they are just like any regular socks. I live in CA and the coldest it gets is ~30 degrees Fahrenheit where I live and my feet are still cold! Was hoping these will work to keep my feet warm during the winter. These thermal socks made no difference. Waste of money."
1.0,Super cheap.  I threw them all away!
1.0,"super cheap. i know its costume jewelry, but this was really bad. looks nothing like the picture. plus the charms were really sharp."
1.0,This is NOT very well made and is small for the side I ordered. Do not purchase because it's not worth what you pay...
1.0,This top is made of poor material - wore it once and washed and dried if hoping it would shrink bec I was swimming in it. It got little lint balls all over and didn't really shrink or tighten up.
1.0,"I ordered a small as that fit my measurements and the size I normally wear, however they wouldn't go over my hips."
1.0,It’s not made for large women if you are a bigger size like me I would advise you to not waste your money
1.0,"Very difficult to pull on.  No good for seniors like me, who are stiff and inflexible. I gave mine away."
1.0,strap broke within 1 week
1.0,"Unless you live in the tropics, the Casio solar watches are totally worthless and their customer support doesn't work at all.  I bought this watch about 6 months ago, ok in the summer when you're outside all the time and not wearing a coat outside.  Aparently Casio has never heard of winter, where people wear coats and stay inside most of the time.  The watch now after charging in a window all day will hold a charge for maybe 4 hours.  Absolutely worthless.  Try to Email them and their server won't take the mail.  Save you money!"
1.0,La tela para nada se prevé a la de la imagen...
1.0,"Comfortable but not enough belt loops, have to constantly adjust. Zipper on cargo pockets are sharp and scratch the hands pulling things out. Thigh pockets are connected to cargo pockets so even if you put things in the thigh pockets they end up in your cargo pockets. Terrible design overall."
1.0,The worst quality ever!
1.0,It did not hold up on the first try in the pool it ripped very easy.  I had to throw it in the trash. I can't believe I spent that much money to throw it away on the first try
1.0,Terrible shipping and terrible quality.
1.0,Just received mine in the mail.  Tarnished so so bad.  Was almost black all over except for maybe a tiny spot which told me it was supposed to be silver.  AND the number 925 is engraved on the FRONT of each earring!  Must have been intended for back/ inside.  Spent 30 minutes polishing w/ tarnish solution to see if it would work before sending back.  So moral of the story..... you get what you pay for!!
1.0,This set was very cheaply made. The &#34;pearls&#34; are clearly fake. I'm giving it to my niece as play jewelry because I can't wear it.
1.0,Where you paid to review this!  I just got and wanted to see if this was a ship dropper selling cheap china stuff.  One squat and the one stitch in crotch area ripped like a piece of paper.  These are poorly made.  Just go to chinese site and buy these for 9.00
1.0,Very disappointed that I received the item damaged.  There were no heavy items in the box that would have applied pressure to crush backs. Which leads me to believe they were packaged damaged.
1.0,Don't buy runs smaller then what it should . Was not happy with the purchase .
1.0,"The strap itself looks good but I could not even install it... The installation screwdrivers do not work, they are not tight enough to get the screws out.<br /><br />Very disappointing so don't waist your time and money."
1.0,Leeteuk's photocard was very low quality and dark. Very hard to see.
1.0,The top looked nothing like the picture
1.0,I ordered a small. It was very boxy shaped.
1.0,These are not silk
1.0,The left arm opening of the dress was sewn closed. Sent back the same day it was delivered.
1.0,"I love the look, but it feels just like a swim suit top. The same material. There is barely any stretch to it. I ordered according to my measurements and I honestly think I could have gone 2 sizes up. I almost couldn’t get it back off by myself."
1.0,Just a two magnets on rubber strip...Should cost 5 cent max.
1.0,I want to put my credit card in the wallet and it ripped on the side can I get a refund so can get a better one
1.0,Was very small. I usually wear a size 4 and this one size fits all was still too small.
1.0,I ordered a red blouse. The sleaves were fire engine red and the body of the shirt was an orange shade. SOOOOOOOOO wish i had returned this item.
1.0,"The cut is awful! Too high, then it's all bunched. Going from the package straight to the goodwill. Don't waste your money!!"
1.0,This is NOT childrens size... my husband who is 6 feet tall and wears a 3x can wear this and it still is somewhat loose
1.0,I already said it!
1.0,"This item is not at all what you see in the photo.... the photo clearly looks like a nice flannel like, cotton material but it’s not. The material was very thin and completely see through... I’m very disappointed."
1.0,"This dress was too tight, and the material had no give.  Even if it fit, it was too short to be a dress.  I ended up throwing this in the garbage."
1.0,"Mal corte, tela de muy mala calidad"
1.0,The scarf I received was 7.8&#34; shorter and half the width of what it was described as. Too short for a wrap around (like the photo) and looks more like an Ascot so I will never wear it.
1.0,"The colors are not as pictured & that means everything to me. The fit is fine, the material is fine, the colors are wrong.  And for an $18 T shirt i expect it to be 100% accurate."
1.0,I cant even wear these. WAY too large. And the material is cheap and see through.
1.0,Didn’t wrap my wrist properly. Hard to line up evenly. Returned it.
1.0,"First, I regretted that I didn't look through all of the photos, because I had no idea it was open in the back, with a tie-back waist sash. But I still liked it, it was just unexpected.<br />Second, I regret not returning it (my window for returns closed a few days ago, of course) because the waist tie folds over or under on itself all the time, and then the dress looks funny and it's super annoying that it keeps happening!!!<br />I'm sad because I liked it, but I can't stand to wear it because of this."
1.0,The Bose keep falling off.
1.0,Definitely not worth what I paid.  They do NOT lessen glare at night.  Waste of money.
1.0,Not what was shown... no opening for the mouth! No hole opening in the ears to hear! In my opinion it's false advertising! No a happy camper
1.0,"Poor fabric, not worth the price. I returned it,"
1.0,"This dress (in white) is 100% see through! The lining is a thin fleece, which is kind of nice, but shows EVERYTHING.  Fit is as expected. I ordered a small, I'm 5', 110 lbs, it hits just below the knee. The size/fit wasn't the issue, it's just poor quality, maybe it isn't as bad with the darker colors."
1.0,cheap. the worst. boo
1.0,Item pictured is not item I received. Going to return it
1.0,Bought for my 13 yr old granddaughter.  This is what she requested sending me the link.  I was greatly disappointed in the quality.  I would have never paid $50 for this cheap necklace if I had seen it in person.  Looks and feels like something you would buy for a 5 yr old for maybe $5.00.
1.0,we tried numerous times and this machine kept binding/jamming up and would cost more to send it back so giving it to GOODWILL.
1.0,"I thought this item was super cute and I was so excited for it! Sadly, it broke while my boyfriend was putting it on me for the first time. Definitely not very durable"
1.0,"The fabric is incredibly thin and the dress is cheaply made. The quality is so poor, it's pretty much unwearable. Even if it was free I would not keep it."
1.0,Mal producto mala inversion
1.0,My granddaughter can't even wear this dress for a minute because it scratches her. For the cost of the dress one would think it would be at least wearable! It's cute in the photo. It was given as a gift and now it sits in her closet she may as well just throw it away! What a waste of money.
1.0,"Item came apart before I could remove the end piece. I paid more in shipping than the item cost, now the seller wants me to pay for return of the faulty item."
1.0,The necklace had purple spots throughout.
1.0,Very poor quality. I returned it the same day I got it in the mail. The strap broke immediately
1.0,Way to small so I am hoping I can exchange.
1.0,"I order size ""L"" sometimes use M or L , but this size like ""XS"" suuuper small like For 10 years girl 😖😖😖"
1.0,"Item was not only too large, but was compressed in a plastic to the point that it looked nothing like the advertisement. The fur on the hood is not like the picture and it was and still is wrinkled and too long. Not happy at all."
1.0,"This shirt was ridiculously small. I wasn't really expecting it to fit correctly; I'm a DD, but everything about this shirt was proportioned ridiculously small. The shoulder straps hardly fit around my arm, the waist band and tie together were probably only 38 inches long giving little or no room to actually tie the shirt, much less make a bow, and the straps are not adjustable. Honestly it fit my 3 year old niece better than it fit me."
1.0,I don't like the color way too bright!  it's not as pictured and the material sucks 😞 waste of money
1.0,"I got my order as promised on time. The quality of the material is nice an soft, very thick. However after trying on the underware, I could'nt wear them for long. After about 5 minutes the lining material that goes around the opening of the leg is thick an not very giving. It digs into the hip an when its under clothes it leaves a panty mark. I tried to do some adjusting, but there is no hope its the way the undies are made, the material is too hard an not much give. Plus the top of the panties that goes around the waist starts to roll down on you an i had to keep fixing that. So I just decided to remove them an put them back in the drawer. there is no way I can comfortably wear them - there is no point in having the,. I wish I could return them - but how do you send back something like this you have already put on? You don't I would not order these again unless I know for sure they fit better. Besides these issues they look as if they would be nice to wear if I didn't have any hip or i guess any ass..."
1.0,Arrived broken! I was so disappointed!
1.0,This particular pair should not have been sent out since the design folded on itself and stuck. Ordered these for a family Christmas card. Material is thin considering the price. Wouldn't buy again.
1.0,I ordered a 2x and it was so small i just lost out on money but over all it looked very nice in the hanger I am 230 pounds what size should I have gotten. Beats me
1.0,"I love the cut of these, they are comfortable, but I am disappointed in the fabric quality. The fabric is VERY thin and see through, not opaque as advertised. Would be great for pajamas, but definitely not suitable to wear anywhere out of the house. I say one star because I purchased these in hopes to actually wear them to the yoga studio, definitely not thick enough or durable enough for that purpose. Overpriced for the quality of the product in my opinion."
1.0,Does not fit. Hands too tight
1.0,Just turned everything yellow
1.0,"I was looking for an alternative band that wouldn't irritae my skin like the original Garmin band had. Worked well for a few weeks, but found it will hold smells if you sweat, wear it in water or keep it on while washing dishes. After multiple stretches to get band on and off my wrist the band came undone and could not be put back together. Is not great for a long term band. If thats what you're looking for. It did also leave a rash on my wrist. The leather bands seem to work best for not getting rashes on your wrist. It's not worth the money. It can be smelly. And it is not secure to hold your Garmin watch."
1.0,BOUGHT A 3X...IF YOU WERE A FAT KID FROM CHINA...IT WOULD FIT!
1.0,They are so tiny Not worth the price I paid for them.
1.0,"The chain broke after one use. I returned it and will not irder again. It was one of my daughter's christmas gifts,  so I'm was pretty disappointed."
1.0,"After 1 wear, it fell apart!"
1.0,"The material is 90% polyester- basically as stiff as a Halloween costume. The detail specifically listed, “ HIGH-TECH INTERLINK FABRIC. Fabricated from 79% polyester and 21% spandex...” also, the bottom flares rather than staying tight on the calf. They look a bit more like pointe pants than leggings, do not breathe well, and are not comfortable for working out."
1.0,"If you like dying a lot in video games, spend money on this, ‘tis lit."
1.0,"This purse arrived with uncured glue that had a strong odor of commercial grade glue. The purse frame was also broken. I needed it for a costume party so had no choice but to use it without time to exchange or return it. Awful to mail and unfinished product like this, I had to sit it outside in the sun to dry after hot gluing the frame back together. Thank goodness it was cheap price wise to begin with."
1.0,This is not the charger for the Fitbit Charge/Fitbit Charge HR as advertised!<br />This appears to be the charger for the Fitbit FLEX!
1.0,To small for the actual size it ok for 1 time use
1.0,"The zipper is made out of plastic, it broke the first time I put it on.  Waiting to see if I can get a refund.<br /><br />Few months later, never heard back from seller.  Ended up throwing it out.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"The photo doesn't show this but you need a college degree to wrap this.  And the wraps are a cheap braided cotton strip, not self material.  Looks just awful on.  It an awkward fit and awkward look (if you can figure it out).  The photos show the model with the jacket open and it's just not possible with those ties.  If I could rate zero I would.  It would have been so cool if they would have just made a nice loose jacket with a zipper.  Sheesh.  If you are determined, I had considered sizing up because it was sort of odd - but I do not recommend sizing up."
1.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but after buying these pajamas I feel totally cheated.  I have bought rayon pajamas before and they are usually very soft and cool, but the fabric of these pajamas is extremely warm and uncomfortable. I lost my money on this purchase."
1.0,"The waist, hip and butt area is huge while the legs are ok fitting. Not a good design"
1.0,Some of the balls were missing so I was unable to screw them.
1.0,Breaks easily. Not durable.
1.0,"I am so disappointed with this dress. I was looking forward to receiving it in the mail and as soon as I opened it, I knew it was going to be a fail. The fabric is cheap and completely see through ! Way too stretchy, doesn't have a perfect fit to your body. I ordered the khaki color, maybe it is different for black but I definitely DO NOT recommend this dress :( nothing like the picture ! I am 5'3 and weigh 120. I will be posting a picture soon."
1.0,Sent actual safety pins.
1.0,"Very pretty, but the material is cheap and itchy.  Fit snug, but I am not surprised.  Most women's clothing sold here is a bit to a lot smaller.  This was just a little smaller than expected."
1.0,Runs about 1/2  sizes small
1.0,"After several weeks with this watch and, I am very unhappy with the quality of the product. The paint has been flaking off of it. The seller contacted me and offered me a replacement, but I have yet to see it or have any other correspondence from them"
1.0,"This product was terrible when I received it. The steap had a piece missing so I could not adjust it to size, it doesnt smell like leather at all. The button for the outside pocket doesnt work and the inside zipper was split when it came WHICH was today. So I fixed it. Jopefully they do not try and sell this to someone else."
1.0,Definitely not sized in American sizes.
1.0,I specifically asked before buying if this was stainless steel and I was told yes. It is not stainless! My skin is green and the band is rusty only after one week use! So very disappointed.
1.0,The waistline is too high
1.0,Mala calidad además llegó rota
1.0,"I wanted to like this dress but unfortunately I’m quite disappointed. The sizing is way of. If you want it to fit like a dress like the actual photo, you’ll have to purchase 2-3 sizes up. I purchased my actual size based on my body measurements according to their chart, this “dress” fits me like a too small T-shirt or tank top. The material is also not the best of quality either. So disrespectful and returning."
1.0,worst purchase arrived faulty and useless will not atatch to iwatch am sending back hopefully company send  me my full promised refund  so upsetting
1.0,The old chain color black. Super old!!!
1.0,Many of the sequence fell off just trying them on
1.0,Muy apretado en la cintura<br />Incómodo<br />No muy buena calidad de tela
1.0,"Breaks within a day of wearing it, metal is incredibly weak"
1.0,Heck no. I got xl for a 5'10 200lb and it's a tank top with pockets. My mother n law 5'2 had irmt barely covering her butt. The fabruc is static like...its a no go heck no
1.0,"I ordered these pants in two different colors hoping for my new favorite pants but I was very disappointed. Although These pants look cute in the picture, we’re awful when trying one. The fabric was cheap and transparent and the fit was all wrong. I ended up returning both!"
1.0,"Shame on me for being so gullible... These are the STUPIDEST ever & Im embarrassed I was stupid enough to fall for it. These do NOTHING to improve night vision. Still halos, glowing & glare, only instead of white light, the light is yellow.<br />DO NOT Waste your money, they don't work, and can even say the makers make rather grandiose if not false claims."
1.0,The material has no give length wise. I couldn’t get it up on my shoulders as it has the torso length of a child’s size. It fit my 12 yo but was almost too short for her too. Lots of stretch horizontally. Had lots of room in the butt and chest just couldn’t pull it up over my shoulders as I previously stated.
1.0,"sent them back, they are so wide that they are a trip hazzard"
1.0,Top is weird
1.0,Came all stuck together and smelled weird!
1.0,"This sweater was just bad in every aspect.  It was uncomfortable.  Runs super small.  The material is just weird, and that beautiful look that the model in the picture shows is FAR from the truth.  I got a large."
1.0,Fabric was horrible.
1.0,"I didn’t like how it fits on me, the chest area was great, but the waist area was pretty big. No! I didn’t like the way it make me look."
1.0,The nike swoosh fell off after a few hrs but I needed to keep hair out my face so I kept it but overall waste of money
1.0,"Buyer beware, Asian sizing.  Seems like decent product other than sizing.  No way are these showing up larger as stated in the other reviews."
1.0,After normal wear for 2 weeks it broke. While i was just running the metal band broke apart from the watch face and my watch went flying. Luckily I had a face protector or it would have been VERY costly. I do not recommend this band.
1.0,Only 6 days!!! 6 days!! Slipper is falling apart and seller don’t response my question. Need to return this. So disappointed.
1.0,"The top-half is way too open and exposes the chest, and the slit in the bottom-half goes all the way up to my crotch. There needs to be buttons on this dress. Had to send back"
1.0,"This band detaches itself multiple times per day !! At first I thought I was bumping it against something, or..........  But, Its ULTRA ANNOYING !!! Detaches unexpectedly while I'm walking, folding clothes, Whatever !#!#  My Original Fitbit  band just wore out.  This one I'd like to Throw out !  It's in a favoraite color, matches my phone, etc...... But,  I'm tense all the while I wear it for fear it will detach while in a busy venue, or.... and my charge 2 unit be destroyed or lost.  I should try another brand, go back to the Original product.  FRUSTRATED ! ,Babe D."
1.0,"Beautiful dress, but the material looks cheap. The color looks nothing like the dress. It looked dusty.  Like it had been sitting for some time."
1.0,Not long.  They are more like a just there 34 length.
1.0,Sent them back. Too flashy
1.0,the measurements listed are totally off on this dress. i ordered a large. im a 34d  and i normally wear a l or xl depending on the outfit. the body suit portion was the problem. it was too short. i was able to pull it up past my hips but i could not put the scraps over my shoulder because it was too short. very sexy dress but the size was just not right.
1.0,"I wanted Large to fit a man, got Xtra small"
1.0,This is ridiculous. I ordered an XS corset and what arrived ... glad I looked is actually made to fit an M -XXL person.<br /><br />Being 5’0 and a 24 inch waste means I am tiny all over . So disappointed that this came but glad I checked!
1.0,Very thin wouldn't recommend to anyone to buy
1.0,The photo looked different then what I received.
1.0,way to big and just not cute at all
1.0,These are way smaller than what I was expecting. They're such a weird size.
1.0,"It is still too small, but I've thrown away the tag and bag so I'll just keep it. I'm not happy with it though!"
1.0,Only received one and it broke when I tried to open it .
1.0,VERY CUTE BUT WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL
1.0,"This shirt doesn't looks good like . And it doesn't absorb sweat. That really makes me unhappy. When do exercise,the shirt doesn't absorb sweat is a disaster. Really uncomfortable."
1.0,Would not recommend size is to small
1.0,I would give it 0 stars if I could
1.0,This product is sized completely wrong and is not cut as pictured. I wear a size medium in virtually everything and every brand I own. I ordered a medium and it hit me at the waist and was slightly  fitted all over. It is not at all the oversized long look I expected to receive since that is what is advertised. This might fit an elementary school aged child as pictured but not an adult.
1.0,"Not worth a penny. Didn't even make it one month and battery started to die. Love the simple, slim fit of it."
1.0,Nice shirt but the button broke off the first time I wore it
1.0,If only there was a minus star selection.. this fabric is horrible for the style of dress. Beautiful style. Horribe design. Lace edges are frayed and not sewn properly.
1.0,The bust of the dress is way too small to be an extra large
1.0,"Very small, could be ear rings for a baby."
1.0,I brought those to the jewelry store just to confirm what I though that this is not a freshwater pearls but just coated plastic.
1.0,not even close - I bought a 38 A and I would say it is closer to a 32 A.  Not sure how they are measuring but not US sizing.
1.0,Failed out of the package not worth sending back.
1.0,"I typically wear a medium, and knowing it runs small, ordered an XL- it fits everywhere perfectly except under the arms is awkwardly baggy. I also ordered it in hot pink and it is bright orange. I tried to return it but it came from China and I would have to pay shipping to send it back- which is more than what I paid for the shirt."
1.0,Small bust size up 2X if you have C or D cup size
1.0,This dress is too tight and short. It is above my knees on my thighs. I bought it for work but reconsidering. The shoulder are is tight also. There are no strings to hold the belt in place. Wondering if I made the right choice to purchase this outfit!!
1.0,"This was a gift for a friend.  I was very disappointed by the thin material and the size.  Ordered a 5x, which is usually very loose on my friend, but this hugged her tightly.  I was expecting a loose, flowing, swing.  Worth about $10.99 at K-mart, not the $30 I paid."
1.0,"Clip is a quality item, but the illustration is deceptive. The delivered item is only 1, one, clip."
1.0,Don't waste your money. Poorly made. Arms are way too small. Even if you order up<br />In size the arms wouldn't fit.
1.0,the bra fit well comfortable but i will give it one star because of net mesh material in the back of it  its terrible i only wear the bra once yes correct one wear and the bra look like i was wearing  for 6 months straight cause after the first wear by the mesh area horrible it looks like the next time i wear it .it will tear apart poorly made material will not buy this bra again customers beware !
1.0,They didn’t fit. The straps were huge. I don’t see how anybody could wear these. I gave them away. Never even wore them.
1.0,Way smaller than expected. Very difficult to open one they are put on.
1.0,The rubber around the eyepiece fell off after one use.  The lenses are not focused and the goggles are very uncomfortable across the nose.
1.0,This blouse was not what i expected.. not satified with what i've received. Doesn't look exactly like the picture quality.
1.0,Can't wear these as they irritate my ears.  It's a shame because they are pretty.
1.0,Had to return this looks like it was something you would order for small child.
1.0,"The elastic gave out after one ride leaving it loose even on my large head.  Also it doesn't dry very fast (as in it's 2 days after my  first/last ride wearing and still damp), so if you sweat maybe look for something higher quality"

1.0,When I received this it was broke  Not made well  was disappointed . Doesn’t look as nice as it does in picture
1.0,they were too small.
1.0,"The pair of these earrings that I received are not well made at all.  They are &#34;un-wearable&#34; because the hole in the large &#34;pearl&#34; backing is way too large for the post, so it just slides right off. The studs are not aligned neatly on the &#34;dice&#34; which gives it a very cheap appearance. I was not at all pleased with these. I should have returned them but unfortunately I already got rid of them."
1.0,2 sizes smaller than normal. Definitely hand wash and air dry. Will Shrink. Not worth the money
1.0,For the price ok it likes like ok costume jewelry.<br />Actually came from China direct
1.0,Liked the hat but it was shipped in a box that was too short for the height of the hat. Essentially the hat was squished to fit in the shallow box and had a creases and wrinkles that didn't straighten out.
1.0,"Top part it's ok, bottom part it's huge, don't like it."
1.0,Arrived completely folded and misshaped.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:554ea8336f3d8bb2ebe8ca54532ca02c]] Disappointed.  The picture does not match what I purchased the color is very bland and it’s huge on me makes me look pregnant which I’m not
1.0,Looked like a dead rat.
1.0,Unsatisfactory
1.0,"The post at end of chain went through piercing fine.  The chain however, did not.  Chain is a tad bigger than post.  Chain got stuck and would not budge.  I had to use cream to slowly pull through my ear.  As I was pulling back through, the middle of the piercing also came forward.  It was not good.  I really wanted this kind of look, but now I am afraid to try any like this."
1.0,looks great but broke in 3 days
1.0,Doesn’t hold much and the zipper feels like it’s going to break at any moment will contacting for a refund sadly because I was so excited
1.0,I ordered a s/m because I wear a size 7 in women's and I also have wide feet. The first pair I wore fit well and was comfortable. The next pair was too big and loose and it seemed that they all were like that other than the first pair. This was after I had washed them all. Would have given it a 4 star review had they all fit like the first pair.
1.0,"I thought this was a great deal, but two of these tanks died the first time they were washed (and they were washed on gentle in a small load). We have an APO address, and by the time the package arrived and she cycled through wearing them, the defect wasn't discovered until our return window was closed (just 3 days ago, but now there is no option). Save your money and buy  better tanks you won't need to replace. These are basically disposable level quality."
1.0,These are way too small to be considered Women's.  I have tiny hands and can barely tug them on.  Returning.
1.0,"Tight, not true to size and kind cheapy."
1.0,2.5 weeks of wear and the sole is already coming off.  Such a waste of money
1.0,These earrings were a waste of money. The wire was so thin that it bends it in before you get it in the air. Plus the stone is so heavy and the wire so skimpy they look bad.
1.0,"This hat is very very poor quality and looks like its been through a washing machine. Please do not make mistake I did and purchase this hat. Then I wanted to return it and I guess my time ran out?? Did not know I had a small time limit window. I have purchased many Nixon hats and most of them are great, but this is for surely not one of them. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!"
1.0,Pump keeps detaching. Hat can't flip.<br />My daughter is very disappointed.
1.0,"The issue with this product is that I needed it to be wide and it said it would in the description. Once I got the item, they were not very wide but I got tired of constantly buying and returning slides, therefore, I’m trying to stretch them out. Now they have started ripping on the edges of the fur and I have to super glue it back. It’s just frustrating I didn’t buy what I wanted."
1.0,"This dress in white is completely see through. Material is very cheap. It fit well, but there was no hiding my undergarments!"
1.0,"Search was for USA made masks and package clearly marked ""made in China"", washable to me means washing machine and instructions with masks state to soak in hot water for 5 minutes then by hand squeeze and dry by laying on flat surface.  I THREW IN MY GARBAGE!!!"
1.0,The material is stretchy and feels like gym clothes. It is not cotton or soft at all. Not what I expected. Did not like the material.
1.0,These are meant for small broaches. The stems are not very wide and slide around if you use a regular size or big pendant. Not one size fits all.
1.0,"Just to be sure I get one that was the right fit, I ordered the same dress twice, one in small and one in medium for my daughter. Today I received my order. One medium sized dress and a pair of LINEN PANTS!<br /><br />I could understand if it was the wrong size or even the wrong color, but a totally different item! WTH! This is for a very special occasion and I do not have time to wait for another shipment to come. My only hope is this medium fits. If it does not, I have been a prime customer for many years and have experienced other shipment and/or product issues, but I may have to cancel my subscription for good. I cannot express how disappointed I am."
1.0,"Cheap looking, bad quality"
1.0,Everything was too small way to small I was super excited to get this and when I did my smile turned upside down
1.0,"From the picture, it looks like the hat is a soft canvas material. In reality, it is more plastic and stiff. The hat is misshaped and not worth the money or the wait."
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all
1.0,Misleading saying it fits women ... I can barely get them to latch around my ankle. Will be passing along to my young niece.
1.0,"I was so disappointed in this top.....it is NOT a sweatshirt!  It is a thin polyester fabric, not fleece.  I wanted to warn top for my granddaughter.  This was not what I expected.  Returned it."
1.0,"Soooooooooo disappointed. The puffed shoulder wasn't sewn correctly so it just looked like a sleeve pushed up too high, the waist line came to the top of my ribcage, which is obviously larger than my waist line, so that didn't look flattering, the material was not comfortable and was much shorter in person than the picture let off. I do not recommend unless you're super short and have no ribcage."
1.0,"I bought a white one and loveee it. So I bought a champagne one and I received this item with a used tobacco pen cartridge inside. I discarded the skirt for obvious reasons. Then, this morning (without asking for a replacement) received another skirt in beige. Wish it was the color I wanted (champagne)"
1.0,Cheap material not cute at all!
1.0,This product was confusing and didn't hold up my C cup breasts. I model and having a strapless bra is important. This was a waste of my money and I wish I could return the product because all of the bras have been sitting in my dresser untouched aince I bought them.
1.0,No era lo que esperaba viene en partes la cinta de la cintura y la decoración y eso no viene en las fotos está muy raro
1.0,Will spend the money on Fitkicks next time. These are NOT as advertised.
1.0,Not mirrored or chrome. Plain black not what i was purchasing
1.0,"These sunglasses are not polarized. They are a mid-grade sunglass, but don't fool yourself into believing they are polarized."
1.0,Poor quality. The print in the front came out just washing by hand.
1.0,Bad material and terrible mold! It’s impossible to know what is the front side because there’s no side! Fits terrible and uncomfortable
1.0,Returning. Don't like the fit and the dress itself.
1.0,was represented as being a 299.00  dollar  watch on sale its really a 10 dollar cheap made bad value for the price just say its a 10 dollar watch
1.0,[[VIDEOID:70ce83eafd47ab2bf8dab3b0e63cdc5b]] All the stones fell out..smh
1.0,I was literally only to fit one leg into the pants. It was waaaaay too small
1.0,"This dress is nothing…. NOTHING like the flutter sleeve mauve/pinkish color dress I waited for. It’s a immature looking bubblegum pink. It has the ugliest, most unflattering sleeves I’ve ever seen, and it’s a high neck. Beware. See the picture for proof.<br />Oh and I waited weeks for this dress and somehow paid 41$? Oh well, it was immediately returned."
1.0,The adhesion tab/strap needs to be longer to adhere closer to shoulder area for LARGER BREASTS
1.0,I ordered twice! A large then an extra large still too small. My son was so disappointed
1.0,"I had such high hopes for this, but honestly it looked ridiculous on me. Seriously, like a cupcake costume."
1.0,"Even one star is too much!  Could not see anything through these glasses.  Even with the lights turned on, all I saw was blurry image - like looking through frosted glass.  No matter how I angled the eye lens, the image never improved.  Would not have ordered if I realized only a 30 day window to return.  Bad description and reviews from Amazon and seller!"
1.0,I am usually a 2x in women’s. Bought these to be fat Thor for Halloween in a 2x. Wouldn’t even go up my thighs so I thought fine I’ll return and buy the largest (I think 5x) because it was the print I was looking for. Nope they were still pretty tight and the fabric was cheap. Not worth it at all
1.0,"Does not fit on my luggage handles. No way they would survive an airplane trip. Would work if they made the velcro area larger.  Stuck with them due to high shipping cost of  return. Amazon courier is  at my building on regular basis, would be nice to be able to hand off to them for return. After all they delivered it."
1.0,Not stainless steel
1.0,"Shoulder strap is defective, it came apart when I put it on my shoulder at the airport the very first time I used it. I am sending it back."
1.0,"This hat is the perfectly wrong size. When I put it on, the part in the back that is supposed to flop down in a relaxed way actually stands straight up and makes me look like a conehead."
1.0,This product is trash. How the hell does a company make a strap for a Fitbit Versa 2 that has no pins or locking mechanism to keep the strap attached to the device. The velcro and material are the same as similar ones but the only word to describe this one is FAIL.
1.0,It does not sit upon head the way I hoped. I washed it once and it won't go back to shape. It's now in the back of the closet.
1.0,How did this item pass quality control?  One foot was completely missing bottom part.
1.0,"It's a nice hat, but the lights turned on and you cant turn them off.  An hour later the lights died out and you cant recharge them.  Now he is stuck with a hat that has a battery pack right near his eye.  You are better off buying the hat without the lights. Waste of money."
1.0,these were a big disappointment.  both fell out the first day I wore them.  the Velcro strap is too 'short' so it doesn't hold tightly enough on the bra strap.  Many years ago I had a great pair of Velcro strap shoulder pads that worked well so I know it is possible.  these are also very small -- not that I want large 80's style shoulder pads but they could be 'thin' and well shaped and still be a nice size.
1.0,A total waste it fits kids size uughh
1.0,[[VIDEOID:12219f1c22a7ad60460b585bd861dc0e]] I’ve never had a band come off while I was working out.  This one did and my watch hit ground and shattered
1.0,The quality looks very poor...
1.0,The black and white fabric has a blue stripe as well
1.0,"this is really coarse material, almost ripped at seams when I tried it on..uncomfortable at the arms.<br />I'm really small built but this was tight in places, and bagged out in others. I ordered 4 different dresses from amazon and they are beautiful, and fit perfectly. This is a return..sorry..."
1.0,This was made horibbly cheesy & cheap smh one star because it case faster then expected TRASH
1.0,Sending back
1.0,Very cheaply made material very see thru
1.0,Bought this for our sons Halloween costume and with in a day the lights starting to smoke and burn out.
1.0,Like the belt because lightweight but has to be replaced often because of eyelets wearing out.  Just received this. Just received belt last week and already lost an eyelet.very poor quality.
1.0,"It doesn’t sit well, after you open it’s uneven and not fixable…."
1.0,Gorgeous watch. However the stem broke off the first week it was worn. Amazon replaced it and the second one came in with the back broken off and it wouldn't click back on.
1.0,can see it through everything. What the point of wearing when everyone can see through. I thought if I order it from here it will be good quality but it wasn’t.
1.0,"Cheap stuff, looks like two dollar worth. Don't waste money on it. I would've returned, but couldn't in time frame and now stuck with it"
1.0,"It was way small,... order your belt much longer than your waist size."
1.0,Looks pretty but it caught and snags everything!  The bracelet got snagged on my shirt which is now ruined.  The necklace snagged on my sweater.  So which I had never gotten this.  Hate ruining one of my favorite outfits!
1.0,"Fue un regalo y a la semana me lo enseñaron que se estaba pelando el brazalete, súper feo ese dato."
1.0,"Not impressed. Spent over $20 to receive a shirt with holes and snags in it and some type of black stain on the back. This was for a customer that has already paid me and I was supposed to have it completed by tomorrow but now I won’t be able to do that, which means instant refund for her & I have to wait several days before I’m able to be refunded."
1.0,Didn't fit my Pulsar watch.
1.0,Tried to cancel my order but the seller only responded saying that they didn't understand what I wanted and they proceeded to ship it anyway. This locket is very cheap and will bend/break easily. It's also difficult to open and close.
1.0,Shrinks a whole lot in the wash
1.0,Too small. Almost  child size.
1.0,"This watchband is beautiful, i love the braiding, however it has already started stretching out. It was delivered on July 14th and as of today (July 29th) it has stretched out enough that my watch slides all over my wrist. This may not bother some people but I actually like my watch to stay in one spot unless I adjust it. If you like to have a tighter fitting watchband I would not recommend this one."
1.0,"I’m 5’4” (sometimes I wear petite - sometimes I wear regular) and with three inch heels, it was 5 inches too long.  This dress dragged the floor like a wedding train. I normally wear a medium, and sized up to a large. While it did fit around my breasts (barely) the neckline was so low it showed my entire bra in the middle. I would have to wear a tank top.<br /><br />It is super cute on and in the navy the print is very flattering around the waist.<br /><br />Size up, and pass if you’re petite."
1.0,This belt buckle broke after just four weeks of normal use. Less than one star!!!
1.0,It broke as soon as I buckled it... I do not recommend
1.0,Refund me!!! Scam
1.0,poor quality which is a shame as it is super cute.
1.0,"Sorry to say but as soon as my niece went to put them on, the stud broke. I was not happy.  I put them in a pkg. In hopes to return them but I had forgotten until now where I had purchased them. It may be too late to return but I just needed to let the seller know."
1.0,The blouse is cute but by the end of the day it had ripped underneath both armpits .
1.0,my fault. i ordered a too small earring. pretty ...so i gave to my granddaughter
1.0,Los zapatos estan bonitos pero muy grandes las medidas no son las correctas y mi niño tiene su pie delgado le quedaron demasiado grandes y hasta pague mas para q llegaran a tiempo
1.0,The frames are super fragile.  Don't wear replacement because I was traveling for one month and missed the window to return them to Amazon.  Dont buy the.
1.0,"I know that the color of the actual product might not be exactly like what is one a computer screen but in this case, it was not even remotely close.  The skirt I got looked a lot like cotton candy pink and fuchsia allover the place (cloud/sunset looking print).  The skirt also took a very very long time to arrive.  The delivery time that it did take to arrive far exceeded the very long expected delivery date.  I can't really recommend this skirt.  I will say however that I have ordered another skirt from the same seller and it came in the expected time frame and was exactly what I expected. (that one was the one that looked like a piece of Japanese art work of a wave/ocean.)"
1.0,It was fine...way smaller than normal fit and the armpit ripped after the first time i wore it. POOR QUALITY. Fine for ONE TIME USE.
1.0,My niece plays the tuba and I was looking forward to giving her these earrings for Christmas.  So disappointed when they arrived today.  The wording on the earrings is so small you can't hardly read it with a magnifying glass.  They don't look at all as they were pictured in the advertisement.  Plan to return if the shipping is free.
1.0,"From the pictures, I thought this would be a pretty cool prop. Unfortunately, it was less than expected. The collectible box has minor outside damage and major damage on inside. The pager turns out to be single piece of metal and while the basic details are good it lacks the realism of a working button or switch. Lastly, the sticker on the display is crap. Really disappointed since this was a gift!"
1.0,I returned this item. It ran really small.
1.0,"Not as pictured, vacuum packed, meaning it's a mess, so wrinkled I don't think it will ever turn to the shape it's pictured. Just disappointed. It is more like a very light sweater."
1.0,"I am a huge fan of PattyBoutik clothes. But this one was a FAIL!!! Fits so weird across the top, doesn't lay right, folds in. Worse one yet, it's cut weird on the sides as well... Epic fail on this one"
1.0,Didn’t stick followed directions exactly
1.0,The picture looked pretty but they never arrived.
1.0,"The shoes are very cute. However they run very big. And I mean big. My granddaughter wears a toddler size 6 too big. Ordered the size 5 still way too big a three probably would’ve fit her. Since she lives out of state I could not return them. Thankfully,she will just grow into them very disappointing"
1.0,"This looked like the perfect waterproof wallet for vacation.  It arrived and looks exactly like pictured however there was a brightly colored slip of paper in the packaging.  This note was a notice that the wallet was &#34;waterproof&#34; unless submerged for any &#34;length of time&#34;.  No details or guidelines to how waterproof it is exactly, just enough of a legal note to ensure I don't want to put anything I want to keep dry in it.  Packaged it back up and returned it."
1.0,"I really REALLY like the way these gloves look. I also love how they feel when you wear them. They're comfortable, warm, and still slick and cool. I do wish however that the wrist strap could go a bit tighter (the tighter of the two snapping points is still loose on my wrist). And I also wish they wouldn't stretch out so much over the course of a few months. I'm a tall and skinny guy with long skinny fingers. I got the XL, but kind of wish I got the XXL due to the fingers only starting halfway between my knuckle and first joints instead of being long enough to have the fingers actually fit my fingers. Issue with buying the XXL though would be that the wrist would be even looser and the already not tight enough strap of the XL would be even larger on the XXL. Overall though, I like the gloves and I really like how they look and feel. I just don't love them and I don't think they'll last more than a Chicago winter or two."
1.0,Did not get the pins in the picture very disappointed 8(
1.0,"I ordered Size XL, however, even though every top said ""XL"" they were not all XL. Two were huge on me and two were too tight."
1.0,"The earrings came broke, very bad material.<br />Don't like it."
1.0,The battery pack didn't work right out of the package and the zipper handle was broken. Will be returning
1.0,I ordered this a size larger to make up for any sizing issues and it's still 2 sizes too small
1.0,"The material is so terrible and fraying. It was also rolled up an a ball in the packaging, it was not folded or in its own packaging, it was just in the Amazon bag. Can not wear in public."
1.0,"It is a children’s size bow tie, not what I expected."
1.0,Within a few hours of wearing the necklace the gold wore off and became a spotty copper color. I asked for a return and was told I could not return it. Buyer beware. I am also filing a complaint with Amazon.
1.0,The scarf in the picture IS NOT what I got. This is some cheap polyester knock off from China.
1.0,"The photo is totally misleading. I thought I was getting a matching mommy and me set of two aprons, but you only get the child set. One child size apron for $20 is a bit excessive. Was super disappointed."
1.0,"The stone was loose,  and it was not of good quality..it cost more to ship it back then what the ring was worth. ;0("
1.0,I want to love this. It’s super cute. The headband and rose part are great. The problem is that the antlers have arrived broken in a bunch of pieces 3 times now. I want it enough that I’ve ordered it one more time. Fingers crossed that it’s not a broken mess this time too. If it’s not broken I’ll give it a 4 star rating but  just super frustrated that I’ve had to order and return it so many times.
1.0,12 month old has worn these maybe 5 times and the zipper busted out. I’m not happy. At $12 a piece these need to last me more than a few weeks. Unfortunately it’s passed the return window.
1.0,"First order was lost in transit. I was finally sent another mask. The mask doesn't fit on my face. It doesn't even lie flat. This needs to be labeled as a toy or childrens' mask. this item does not appear to be the same product as the photo. The band is different from the photo. The lace material is the same, except there isn't enough material to actually cover my eyes, which is the point of the mask."
1.0,It rolled up over my belly.<br />Guess fat people aren't supposes to wea.
1.0,It does not have light
1.0,It was a pain to get in and it was too big and I couldn't use it unless I stretch the hole its self. It was cheap but the shipping took forever.
1.0,When I tried to remove some of the links the tool bent and I couldn't remove any links
1.0,Tore on sleeve after first use.
1.0,"I don't like the material, very itchy!!!!"
1.0,Its cheap and broke on the first week. It pissed me off.
1.0,Ordered the size I wear and couldn't come close to getting them on. Would not purchase again.
1.0,"the material is so thin, u can see through it"
1.0,The product that was sent to me was strapless. The product pictured has straps and refers to spaghetti straps. I would not have bought this had I known it was strapless. I am very upset with this.
1.0,Size is short
1.0,"This looked great, but to see through it was impossible"
1.0,This did not work out for me. Hard to breathe and didn’t like the way it looked.
1.0,Ordered a 7xl and it was the size of a 3xl. Never buy from this company.
1.0,I wore these once.  They literally tore trying to put them on the second time.  Forgot I bought them on amazon or I would’ve returned them.  Not easy to put on.
1.0,"If the sleeves had been sewn in with the seams on the inside of the top I would have ordered them in a couple of colors, but I can't wear something that looks like it is sewn badly."
1.0,Arrived in time. However it feels really cheap and it looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Too tight, and I don't have a big head. Cannot sleep in it. Made few cuts on the side but still did not help. Won't buy it again."
1.0,Runs very large. I ordered a 32 but it fits like a 34/36
1.0,wont work on saw it says it will
1.0,Both letters were the right side of the heart and didn't make a heart when together. Disappointed
1.0,I just did not like the fabric. It was uncomfortable.
1.0,Not what I expected very thin poorly made!  More like a cover up! If u have any type of body this will not fit! Runs small
1.0,"Sending back. Under Normal lighting the face is much darker, hard to see hands"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:588cfe2378506f10ee114f280113a379]] It broke and discolored on the back within a month. They said there is a 90 day return but Amazon only allows one month. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday  and now she can't wear it or get another one.  I ordered it Sept.2 let me know who will honor the money back  guarantee policy.
1.0,"This watch is very delicate, thin bracelet that it seems to break easily specially for a sport watch.<br />They lost the package, it arrived a week later and now I want to return because I don’t like it and I cost just return through ups like most places, I will have to go to post office and all the hassle on printing labels without a printer! Honestly I don’t recommend this store. Not a good service and commodity ZERO! I buy on Amazon because it’s easy I don’t have to do much, it will take a lot of time to drive and wait as you all know post office always have lines!!!!"
1.0,"This is probably one of the cheapest swimsuits I have ever purchased. I ordered a 4XL, considering my normal size is usually a 2X but I know that swimsuits run smaller. When I try it on, not only are the bottoms much too small, but the top looks like its about a C cup, when in the size chart, it explains that a 4XL is about a 38DD. I most definitely will not be buying a swimsuit from this company again. I am highly disappointed."
1.0,"I found the belt itself to be of pretty good quality. The buckle is another story. The release mechanism is a bit fickle at best, and downright diabolical at worst.<br /><br />Allow ample time to manipulate the buckle or you might find yourself in the restroom of a Taco Bell that's attached to a gas station in a panic because that Spicy Double Chalupa with extra fire sauce wants out NOW and the buckle isn't cooperating.<br /><br />I had to nearly dislocate my hip and shimmy out of my pants like Martin Riggs getting out of a straight jacket in the Lethal Weapon movie franchise.<br /><br />Belt: 3 stars<br />Buckle: 1 star<br />Taco Bell: 5 stars"
1.0,They are very pretty but unfortunately I'm allergic to them made ear swell up
1.0,Definitely not like the picture
1.0,These are not even close to fitting. I actually laughed out loud when I opened the packaged and saw the size. On top of the size they were poorly made and the lace itches.
1.0,Could be better quality
1.0,Very small and the chain broke immediately.
1.0,Light-weight is an understatement. This photographs as a jacket/blazer. It's more like a thin shirt w/out buttons.
1.0,Do not buy this cardigan! It is gross and the description is wrong.
1.0,"Normally, when I don't have anything nice to say, I choose not to leave a feedback. However, this one is ridiculous! This dress is not completely as described. The one I received somewhat looks like the one shown in the picture, but a knock-off version. The sleeves don't look the same. The dress I received, its sleeves are shorter and underarm is visible...unlike the one in their description. The belt is not satin. Bottom of the dress is very see-through. What they are selling is not worth the price and I am very disappointed.<br /><br />To the person(s) selling these dresses, you can honestly see that they're not the same as the one in your description, yet, you sell/ship them anyway. That is called deceitful and you're ought to be ashamed."
1.0,"It’s not good for people who have big noses/nostril, it will not fit my nose what so ever."
1.0,"Upon receiving the scarf, I immediately noticed that the product is damaged (see attached photo), which is completely unacceptable. I did not expect this product to be of high quality considering the price. However, I did not expect that it would be this horrific. Also, the &#34;Paskmina&#34; branding label is very securely attached to the scarf, and removing it would undoubtedly damage the scarf (a product quality that is deserving of a lackluster review in and of itself)."
1.0,"They're not for men's, they're more like for kid's."
1.0,Picture is not accurate of what it really looks like
1.0,"Ordered XXXL, fits like a large. That's how these Asian sizes are."
1.0,Not worth the trouble of returning for $10.00. Especially in these troubling times.
1.0,Cute dress but not true to size.  Was way too small
1.0,"So, so quality....Not what it seems like on the website.  One of the earing does not close properly....will never buy again"
1.0,"Cute, but the rose gold one came already broken so I won’t ever wear that. I wore the silver one for a party for only a few hours and  many of the stones fell out. Also it’s very small, I had to extend it just to fit it around my neck."
1.0,The 2X is much smaller than the Tommys that I wear...
1.0,Falling apart after less than 2 months
1.0,I ordered a men’s xl and they fit more like a med. they were tight and I’ll be returning them. Wish they fit for they feel of good quality
1.0,This was cheaply made.  Returned
1.0,"It wiggles at the lugs, on the Fenix 6x pro."
1.0,Poor quality & bad packaging
1.0,I want a darker red. Or wine. This was a very light red.
1.0,The only negative is that the dress isn’t as long as advertised. I’m 5’6 and it stops at the ankles
1.0,"I am a woman with an average sized head (many hats that I wear bear this out) and yet, the strap on these goggles is WAY too tight! Even adjusted to the very ends the goggles put so much pressure on my face around my eyes that I can’t take it! If you can enlarge the strap (and send me the “improved version” I will be happy to try that and review this product again. As it is, right now I can only hope that one day my head “shrinks” enough so I can wear this comfortably. The goggles themselves appear well-made except for strap issue."
1.0,Fake product does not work
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would, and for fit I wish there was a ""weird and bizarre "" option.  The material is paper thin and the arm holes are HUGE resulting in zero nipple coverage."
1.0,"Great looking little pin vise.  Just one problem - the &#34;zero-size&#34; collet holds the teeny little bits at about a 10 degree angle from the center line of the tool, and yes, I DID make sure that the bit was centered on all four of the clamping points and not off to one side or crooked.  Watchmaker's tool?  That's a friggin' joke if I ever heard one!<br /><br />I ended up going to the local hardware store and found the USA-made version that was (poorly) copied in India to make this one.  1 buck more and it works perfectly.<br /><br />When I saw &#34;Made in India&#34; on the package, I thought that it would be of better quality than the usual Chinese junk - WRONG!<br /><br />Returned for refund."
1.0,Hat is shallow and sits well above my ears. Never had a hat sit like this. Looks ridiculous. And the letters are just a cheap iron on sticker.
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all. Would not order
1.0,"Size chart lies, I’m a size 18 and the xl is ridiculously small"
1.0,It was ripped
1.0,Way too big. Not normal Lands End quality. Had to return.
1.0,Crown came broken
1.0,thin cheap material...
1.0,Broke in the first week and never fit right.
1.0,"I wanted this for my backless wedding dress & had to go with/buy another option. It was tighter than expected. The shoulder  straps and bra converter were very thin. The bra cut into me every place it touched. It’s a good idea, poorly executed."
1.0,Not true to size ordered
1.0,"Extremely poor quality upon arrival check, your money goes better for other use"
1.0,"Terrible bag, smells, very cheap!!!"
1.0,"Lint magnet, hardware is the wrong finish, and  the keeper is too large."
1.0,Cheap quality!
1.0,"This necklace is SOO stank. I put it inside some perfumed powder to get rid of the smell for 2 days,and the moldy smell. However the butterfly is larger than expected."
1.0,"Stupid, kind of like a joke. The straps are wrong. Wrong lengths, sewed poorly. Deserves zero stars."
1.0,Very small dose stretch but dont push it not for a big girl
1.0,I did liked that it's very cheaply made mine doesn't glow in the dark the chain is flimsy and trashy. Honestly not worth it.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e08858869e5c1c3b6e42014ee3d3e93c]] Total junk.Received it yesterday and it’s not working.Returning today.DO NOT WASTE YOUR Money on that.
1.0,"Did not like the feel of the fabric, very narrow in the hip area."
1.0,When they came in the color was more so clear with a slight purple hint. I returned them due to being the wrong color. Size and fit were okay.
1.0,I like the pattern and color but the waistband is tight and the material doesn’t stretch not even 1cm. My thighs where way too big for these I guessing  🥲
1.0,Look cheap!!
1.0,"Horrible sizing. I knew to order up in foreign sizes but this size XXL actually fit my 11 year olds size 3 frame. Not my size 10/11. If you have breasts, forget it."
1.0,The product was delivered on time. I does not look anything like the picture. It has a cheap look and feel. I wanted to return the product but I was travelling and was informed its past return time. I will donate it to charity because it does not match wardrobe.
1.0,"I ordered the space themed suit which is black and has planets on it. I opened the package upon receiving it and was instantly super disappointed to find a faded, brown looking, cheaply made swim suit. Not to mention the fact that it was HUGE and I ordered the 3-6 month size."
1.0,"I'm not satisfied with this mask. It's soft and comfortable, but it does not stay on my face well like other masks do. I was wanting a plain black mask, but this wasn't good. It falls off out in public, which has gotten me into trouble when my arms/hands are full and I can't get it back on quick enough without mean stares. It doesn't seem to want to hook well over the ears."
1.0,"Really cheap looking, fit award and I couldn't wear them"
1.0,Cheap and not up to Goorin standards!
1.0,No puedo usarlos porque estan mal fabricados. Los broches estan al reves. Y uno de los aretes esta hacia abajo
1.0,"The material is very cheap (see-through thin when you bend over) and the button holes are frayed. I am 5’8 and the skirt comes right above my knee, so this fits a bit larger and longer than pictured (slightly large on my waist too)."
1.0,I had to return the set because something was in the inside pocket leaving a stain that looked like mold.
1.0,Runs huge looks like a goodwill sweater that someone’s grandma made and sent them for Christmas that got thrown out
1.0,Sent back right away. Arrived with the seam at toe section splitting.
1.0,...or they’ll shrink. They’re great until you wash them — when they turn into ankle-high crew socks.
1.0,This is not what is pictured and not worth a cent.
1.0,"I love the ring itself, but after five days my finger started turning a black/green color. The plating on the outside started coming off as well to reveal the copper on the inside. The description of the ring states that this is ""High quality, no fading, no rust, no allergies."" I am clearly having some of those issues, as the pictures show."
1.0,"Very cheap material.. no zipper, just a slip on dress that doesn’t stretch much. Returned."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:96aef6e606bd41fda266ce52a6b6c38e]] Collar is frayed. Not sewn like someone forgot to sew it. I am returning it.
1.0,a waste of money!!!! very disappointed !
1.0,Not as pictured and I don’t even recommend it
1.0,Flower fell off as I was putting it on.
1.0,Do not judge this by the stock pictures. It is sized for children.
1.0,Only 1 of the 3 bands fit completely in my Fitbit Sense.  For the other 2 bands only 1 side of the band attached but the other part wouldn't lock into place.  I have other replacement bands and have no problem.
1.0,Total different cut! Absolutely not the same from the picture. Smh
1.0,It ripped as soon as my husband put it on his arm.  Horrible quality!
1.0,"These are a great price, but the edges and rough, the earring post is wide and it flares at the back where it clicks in. I bought these to share with my daughter and it hurt too much for me to get them through her ears due to the flared end."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this jacket. Here are the problems: it has some weird foreign design with added panels by the armholes, which looks weird and fits a bit strange; the fabric is WAY too lightweight for this clothing item (jacket), it is more of a top/blouse weight; though it is a spandex blend, it ends up so wrinkled due to the lightweight fabric that it requires IRONING (YUCK!); the sleeves are waaaaay long; and the workmanship is very poor (sloppy stitching throughout). Also, as it ships from China, the return postage exceeds the price of the item, so when I got the first one that was too big, it sadly made more sense to order another with the small  discount offered from the friendly seller, but now I have really overpaid and have TWO jacket that I really don't like at all, for way more money than I even wanted to spend. And I am STILL looking for the perfect leopard print jacket..."
1.0,Don’t waste your money. Flimsy clasp. Junk.
1.0,"uncomfortable, bulky and do not work very well.. save your money..."
1.0,Horrible material. It arrived with a bad smell. Even washing it didn’t work.
1.0,wore twice for about an hour and a half both times. they look like they are at the end of there life already. im 115 lbs so really they shouldnt look like this already. the sole is flattened and also the fit is hard since the heel part swings around every step you take. we had to velcro it almost sideways just so they would stay on straight. i guess this is a semi common problem with these after reading some other reviews.
1.0,TERRIBLE!<br />Cheap see-through material.<br />Super wrinkled. Ugly. Not the color I ordered.<br />Do not buy.
1.0,The product cane stained and clearly used.  I bought it for a work show serving food and I cannot wear a stained garment.
1.0,"This costume is purple not pink. Very cheap material. If you want a quality costume, go to the Disney Store."
1.0,"I was very disappointed in these glasses, very cheaply made. I wouldn't even give them a whole star."
1.0,"Colors are off.<br />Sole looked light yellow.<br />Smelled very plasticy and felt hard, not comfortable as well as made cheaply.<br />My almost 4yo is a 9.5-10 ordered an 11 and they’re too small.<br />Size up if you do purchase but I think target has decent options for same price but made better."
1.0,Too big. Be better as an earring not a nose ring
1.0,I read the reviews but took a chance anyway. I felt very disappointed. It hung like a sack & there's a baggy thing on the front. There are no words to describe it. It has the potential to be cute maybe...with some significant alterations.
1.0,"This Pulsar watch looks great and for a few weeks it did a terrific job of keeping accurate time.  I never needed to adjust or resynchronize the time after initially setting it.<br /><br />Despite me taking good care of this watch, after a few weeks the wristband cracked for no apparent reason.  I tried different watch repair shops but no one could fix it.  Then the square band around the date came off completely and started interfering with the time ticking.  And finally about a week ago the watch just stopped working completely (after just a few months).  I tried replacing the battery but it made no difference, the watch itself just died.<br /><br />Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.  Unfortunately I did not sign up for the warranty with Pulsar immediately after purchasing the watch (you only have a few weeks in which to do this).  If you do decide to buy a Pulsar watch, make sure to register it right away for the warranty.<br /><br />It could simply be that I ended up with a lemon, but I am unlikely to buy another Pulsar watch after this experience."
1.0,These are 16g which is way too thick for a nose or cartilage piercing which are usually 18g or 20g in size. Does not look like picture. I was really disappointed lol
1.0,WASH BEFORE WEARING - my husband ordered this and wore it “straight from the bag”. By the end of the day he had itching and raised bumps - severe allergic reaction to something these are treated/packaged with. He’s on a week of steroid creams and an oral dose as well - his poor neck and upper chest are a mess. He’s never had a reaction like this - totally awful for someone working in the heat.
1.0,The fit was fine. But do not get them wet they will fall apart. I am not mad because I didn't pay much for them but the literally fell apart day 1.
1.0,The paint faded after just one wash..
1.0,"These earrings are horrible! And to make it worse, they do not allow returns. They don’t look like the phot and are not worth what they cost. Do not purchase these!!!!"
1.0,This item is very thin and the logo was printed on it at a slant - not even close to being stright.  It's a piece of trash!
1.0,Awkward is all I can say.
1.0,Sizes are not accurate. My small feels like a large
1.0,TINY. I bought a large and wouldn't fit a small.
1.0,Ripped the first time I wore it. Not on the seams or anything just just had a hole in the middle of the back by the upper waist. Do not buy. Garbage cheap material.
1.0,"Super thin and breathable, would have been perfect for postpartum, but the strap tore on the second wash, and isn't in a apot I’m able to fix. Very disappointed because I was ready to order another :("
1.0,"I really wanted to like this cause the photos look great. But the fabric on this dress felt and sounded like parachute pants. Lots of swishing noise while putting it on and wearing it. The skirt portion is cute, but the top just flared out and had a weird fit. Had to return this one."
1.0,I bought a size up from what I normally buy and they wouldn’t stay up.  5”0 135 lbs they were super small.
1.0,"I ordered shirts for my daughter, I made sure to read all the writings on them, this shirt on the picture says SUPER on it, I just got the shirt and it says BITCH on it."
1.0,Moisture seeps in between the watch and the cover
1.0,It was a Mother’s Day gift for my mom and it was supposed to be a women’s large and it was belly shirt it really made me mad and I had to at the last minute go buy her something else
1.0,I bought three dresses from this seller and this post.<br /><br />Blue – the picture clearly shows this dress has pockets and the one I received does not have one. Looks nothing like the picture – the pattern is even different. This is a cheaply sewn knock off with cheap thin material that won’t last a wash. Contacted seller for refund – will update review when I hear from them. Round neckline is sewn crookedly.<br /><br />White – the picture clearly shows this dress has pockets and the one I received does not have one. Looks nothing like the picture – the pattern is even different. This is a cheaply sewn knock off with cheap thin material that won’t last a wash.<br /><br />White with zipper – Do not buy this dress – it is a cheap knock off and nothing like the picture shows.<br />The material is paper thin with terrible stitching. The zipper sticks and does not work properly. The add states it is a cotton blend. There is no cotton in this dress. It is spandex and polyester.
1.0,Didn’t last not even a month of school. Sooo not worth it.
1.0,It looked like I could of gotten a better ring in a 25 cent machine.
1.0,"It's quite a bit larger than I needed, but luckily I'm a seamstress and will be able to modify it. Other than that, it's excellent quality and exactly as pictured.<br /><br />Updated to add: Alicepub did reach out to me and offer me a $20 refund for my trouble of altering the dress. I, however, did not accept it and will not be giving more stars, as most people are not seamstresses and this would have been a very expensive alteration job (I had to alter the waist, bust, shoulders, and hem-that is a lot of work and would have cost more than the dress itself to alter had I paid someone else to do it). The other girls in the bridal party also had dresses that were far bigger than expected, and one girl's dress is too big to even be altered, and they would not exchange her dress, so she has to buy a new one and hope it fits this time. Alicepub, you need to do a better job of sizing your dresses, as your sizing chart is WAY off and most people can't afford to pay unlimited amounts of money for alterations or new dresses.<br /><br />Update update: ok their customer service is horrendous. Another bridesmaid in our party has ordered 2 dresses, both of which have been totally enormous on her, and Alicepub refuses to take the dresses back or refund her. Do not order from this company. A nice dress means nothing if it's unwearable, and the headache that comes with it is NOT worth it. Go to David's Bridal."
1.0,Too big in some areas. Too small in others.
1.0,"The fabric is very very thin, more like lingerie."
1.0,very cute but elastic broke too easily
1.0,I like these sunglasses but they arrived in the wrong color. It's very disappointing because I had an outfit in mind to wear with them.
1.0,"The shirt was delivered with a large slash in it. It looks almost burnt, very strange."
1.0,neck is not nearly as long as pictured. Not enough to keep tucked into coat.
1.0,Wow the thinnest material I’ve ever seen. This is more like a tshirt than a hoodie. Huge disappointment.
1.0,Cheap pins holding band
1.0,Bought a small ( as recommended by the size chart). They were huge on me
1.0,"These are incredibly sheer. It's like I'm wearing nylon tights. They're super stretchy and comfortable sure, but way too see through."
1.0,Does not fit according to standards
1.0,It broke the first time I tried to put it on.  Never got a change to wear it.
1.0,"This review hopefully is low just because this one watch I ordered was flawed, not a batch, lot or all from this manufacturer. Anyway, the glass of the watch seemed to not be pressed or glued firmly onto the face. It definitely was holding together, but, if I shifted my wrist in the light with the watch on, it reflected oddly in the corner and a few places along the edge. Some might say that's a selling feature, but I was looking for an all-black watch. The iridescence would have been ok if it were all the way around the face of the watch. I returned it unfortunately and none were left for exchange due to the blowouts over day after Thanksgiving sales."
1.0,"Loved the look of it but the chain is so cheap, it was broken when I received it.  Not worth returning.  Amazon should watch the China products."
1.0,Broken at the wing.  Gift to family in Colombia with terrible return procedures
1.0,lasted 1 month before falling apart on a 11 yr old.
1.0,I ordered a large as suggested. It was way too tight. I gave it to my teenager who is a size 1 in juniors bottoms and small in tops. Fit her perfectly. It was a super cute set but sizing is not good.
1.0,Love the pack storage and such.  NOT WATER PROOF! RUINED A BRAND NEW CELL PHONE WHEN GETTING STUCK IN RAIN.
1.0,imnot like it at all and the picture is not the same color like whats im got it<br />thats make me so sad ant feel like im  stupid
1.0,"The ruffle creaps up under your chin. It was so cute but you can't move, it goes up and you have to pull it down. UGH!"
1.0,It Brooke before I had a chance to use... while I was putting on...
1.0,I purchased the black and white striped dress. It’s HUGE! I’m 5 foot 6 and weigh 160 lbs. It’s to the floor and looks like a bag.
1.0,"Ordered a 2x, size fits womens medium maybe. Poor quality fabric.. Took forever to ship and when I asked them to just cancel, it arrived within a week."
1.0,"I dont like the fit, the hat keep twisting on one direction."
1.0,It does not fit Tissot T race
1.0,Because it’s made out of nylon and is double layers it’s very hot and difficult to breath.
1.0,My husband loved these shorts but after only wearing them a few times the whole seem in the leg came out!  For $49 I hope they would last longer!  I think the seem wasnt sewn correctly.
1.0,Item came extremely tangled with strings falling off. Strings were not put on securely as even more fell off if you move it around. Very bad quality.
1.0,Material quality 👎🏽<br />Does not look as pictured<br />Had to give it away
1.0,it is plastic ; (
1.0,"Do NOT waste your money!!!<br />I don't write alot of reviews... But this one I had to!<br />It looks nothing like the picture, it's short (5'8 & it's above my ankles) small does not begin to describe this dress, I ordered an XL & it fits like a small, it stinks, feels like paper!!<br />It just awful! Don't waste your money on this dress!"
1.0,"Horrible quality, returned!"
1.0,Tooooooooo thin. Protects nothing.!!!!!!!!<br />Don’t buy it.
1.0,Both zippers broke my first day of using it. And had to buy a brand new Adidas bag right before my flight.
1.0,As large as a vinyl record. So stupid.
1.0,"These slippers came defective ! One DAY after wearing them , the soul came loose from top fabric of the right slipper. By viewing on Amazon they looked durable -  but not so ! I would recommend to anyone to buy them."
1.0,"Bought these in black green (black with turquoise stripe on the size) for my daughter and after just a few wears the fabric started looking strange and within a couple of weeks they were getting thin and see-through in spots.  They fell apart faster than any other swimwear I have seen, which is a  considerable amount.  Keep shopping and don't waste your money on these unless you are OK with a disposable item that you only need while you are on holiday."
1.0,I bought a size 6 for my 6 year old grandson.  It was way too small and he could not even wear it.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"I don’t know if I am the only unlucky one, but my hat stinks!! I washed it twice and it still stinks!!where did that hat come from?"
1.0,Can you believe that one of the wheels came completely off.  Gone it was gone.  I have no idea how that happened and I am too late to request a return or replacement.  I am not pleased with this product.
1.0,Too flimsy to hold a mask. Do not buy these.
1.0,Super small. Dotti is a good brand. I was surprised by the fit.
1.0,The words were not just printed upside down lol they're upside down AND inside out. It's a Christmas gift for a fellow educator and thank goodness they have a great sense of humor.
1.0,The medium should have said large. Dress is cut big.
1.0,Tarnish after 3 weeks
1.0,"These compression pants were so small...did not even attempt putting them on. Supposed to be full leg. But visually, they are a short capri. They would fit my 8 year old grand daughter but not the adult they were bought for."
1.0,"Very poor quality. After only two days -- TWO DAYS! -- of use, the mitten sections of these gloves had all but detached. If you need the mitten covers for when you are not using your fingers, you should avoid these gloves. As cheaply made as they are, you probably should avoid them regardless."
1.0,Well they sent me the wrong color to start that was very disappointing cause I needed it by a certain date but that's my bad. I need to size down cause it was big fitting. It's pretty nice but could be much better.
1.0,Ordered Large and received XXL
1.0,"I loved how the piece looked! The leaf was so cool but the leaf piece broke off while I was putting it in, I didn’t even get to wear it."
1.0,The zipper broke off the same day I used it!!
1.0,This is not knitted but a print.  The printing is fine until it’s stretched then it looks washed out and faded.  It’s also fairly thin.  Other than that it fits fine and is comfortable
1.0,"Color was not what I expected at all, keeping it because it costs to return, but I'm not happy with the color."
1.0,"strap broke only the second time i wore them, which is pretty disappointing.<br />especially since all i did was get into my car.. nothing extravagant at all..<br />the straps seem to be made out of some type of foam, not the same rubbery material as the sole."
1.0,"I got this pack for Christmas and just got around to trying it out.  Unfortunately I waited too long to return it.  It has a terrible fit.  I'm 5'9&#34; and the front straps are too low and not adjustable to the top position.  When I wear the pack, I can't reach my water bottle in the side pouch.  The waist strap is difficult to adjust."
1.0,The sleeves fit snug but the body portion was made too large.
1.0,Received (3) Black men's glasses instead of what ordered the Pink women's - I needed for the weekend ride for breast cancer run.  When I contacted the seller about the mistake stating I needed the glasses for the weekend they were very unhelpful... they would only send me the right glasses when I shipped back the wrong ones.  They did not care I needed them for the weekend stating &#34; they are not Amazon and can not ship like that&#34;.<br />Sorry I did any business with them. I'll know better next time.  Avoid buying directly from this vendor.
1.0,"Boy was this dress a disappointment! Ordered it for my daughter and measured her and everything but the fit was all wrong. First of all, the garment looks and feels like a cheap nightgown and the &#34;belt&#34; was the cheapest thing I've ever seen. Second, while the sleeves are snug and short, the bust, waist and length were all way too large! Even though we only ordered it to use as part of a Halloween costume it wasn't even worth using it as that. Sent it back...and still waiting on a refund by the way. Definitely do not recommend the dress or the company."
1.0,Horrible!!! Fit very small 😡 Unfinished product... want my damn money back!!
1.0,Don’t waste your money. The alignment is off and so it doesn’t work like it should.
1.0,Not worth it da
1.0,Just received my sweater and it’s NOTHING even close to what is pictured on the model. The “army” print looks more like cow print and the sweater is overall super cheap looking and feeling. Do not even try it. Waste of money!
1.0,"This piece of jewelry arrived on time within 2 days. After cleaning it properly, I put it into my helix piercing. The post on this jewelry is very long, much longer than even the initial post. Within about 16 hours, my entire outer ear was horribly stolen, very sore, and hot to the touch! Of course, I removed it immediately!! Now, 4 days have passed and my ear it still very sore and swollen. Beware!!"
1.0,I have big arms and still to big
1.0,"The idea is a good one and I would like to see someone come up with a better way to handle the sweat and chafe problem.  But this product is not good for it.  The placement of each piece (and they are separate, they don't go around the back) is uncomfortable even with the correct sizing."
1.0,In the picture look nice but once they arrived they look cheap.
1.0,"They were broken when I got them, the lens is out and both lens are scratched"
1.0,Falling apart- returned
1.0,The bands don’t fit the watch even though it says they are for my Apple series 4 watch.
1.0,Dress came apart at the seams the second time I was going to wear it and I was unable to wear it.
1.0,Zipper broke in less than a month. Poor quality. Don't recommend!!
1.0,can't from wish lisi
1.0,It would fit a Medium.  Could not even step into it.  Their size chart is WAY off.
1.0,Doesn’t do what it’s supposed to useless product
1.0,Horrible horrible chemical smell... I washed it 10 times and it smelled my whole house and made our eyes burn !<br />I threw it in the trash !!!!<br />Would NEVER buy from this company again !!!!!
1.0,I was so excited for this. I love the design of this but the material was very thin and can see through w.o even bending over. Definitely not squat proof and would most likely return it. Kinda wrinkles on the 🐫 toe.
1.0,"The material is so cheaply made. Looks nothing like the picture, not even the color matches. It’s absolutely hideous.<br /><br />Your hide my review cause I gave you one star? Your product is not as advertised. It’s cheap. It’s see through. It’s wrong of you to hide the comments because you don’t want to loose money but you’re gonna loose it anyways because it is not a nice dress."
1.0,"Son muy aguadas, no tienen soporte para la nariz y se bajan mucho"
1.0,The seams are not sewn tightly.
1.0,I bought this briefcase for work. Little did i know the painted leather would rub off on<br />My pants everyday. It took me a few days to understand where it was coming from after 3 of my suit pants got ruined with these brown stains. Imagine buying a $100 leather messenger bag and it ends up ruining all your clothes. Need refund urgently.
1.0,the product is off by 2 sizes the length is outrageous .theirs no return label so I'm stuck with an item I cant use. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.!!
1.0,One of the earring comes in separate piece!
1.0,Large is nowhere near fit for most heads as claimed
1.0,"This is cheap crap, nothing like the picture and runs way too small. Very cheap fabric and workmanship. This is made like cheap doll clothes. Bad part is I have another coming in another color. Definitely sending back."
1.0,Color looks nothing like the picture. It’s very dark. So disappointed and sending back.
1.0,Flimsy and cheep looking

1.0,They are see thru I ordered 2 sizes up and they don’t fit and are to tight which I could live with till I moved and you could see my butt thru them
1.0,Do not purchase- each purse fell apart within 24/48 hours of use.<br />Will not order this brand again .
1.0,Smells likes it's made out of rubber and is poor quality. Will try to return these due my disappointment in the lack of quality. They look better in the advertised pictures.
1.0,"These shoes were cute and came the right size, but they are very cheap.  After being worn just once, the sole was totally separating from the rest of the shoe.  Not worth the money to me, and if you're going to buy, make sure you've got some super glue around for repairs."
1.0,"The band doesn’t tangle with my daughter’s hair, which is why it gets one star.  But there is no elastic in the band, or not nearly enough.  So we can’t get them tight enough to keep water out of her eyes...so they are worthless."
1.0,Design comes off in wash
1.0,Terribly cheap fabric and totally different from the picture

1.0,What's up with the pocket? It looks so random
1.0,"What a ripoff. It does not even come with the wall plug. There is a base, a moderate quality cord and a piece of paper telling you to spend more money to use the thing."
1.0,"It would be 0 stars. Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Broke as soon as she put in on, like literally as soon as she put it on"
1.0,Horrible material and was seen wrong

1.0,"The Copper Fit socks were received October 28, 2019.<br />These socks are ""lighter"" than others but overall worked nicely on average (not Too active) days. They have been worn once a week for 6 weeks.<br />As with all my other compression socks they are washed on delicate in a bag & hung to dry.<br />Despite the care, a tear has developed (see photo).<br />No clue as to why this 'split' developed. I have other brands purchased many years ago that are still intact.<br />Not spending any more on this brand.<br />Amazon not helpful with this problem."
1.0,"It may just be my shape, but this did very little for me. When I put it on and pulled the strings the bra just seemed to slide over a bit, and not create any cleavage. I have breasts that sit somewhat apart and was hoping this would work for creating good cleavage when I wear backless dresses, but no luck. The stickiness seemed okay but wasn't great, when I pulled the strings it seemed to shift a bit, but it didn't fall off. I don't know how long it would last. Another annoying thing is I had no idea where to store them since theyre sticky. I was going to use the plastic that covered the stickiness to start but it was very cheap thin plastic and ripped when I took it off, so I couldn't reuse it. Anything else I did ended up with fuzz getting all over it. I never ended up using the bra, so it was a waste for me. Lastly, I ordered my size and it didn't seem to cover my breasts as much as it does in the pictures, so I think they run small. Not recommended overall."
1.0,"I was soooo excited for these leggings, especially given all of the great reviews. I absolutely love the fabric of both pairs I purchased the grey and charcoal. I was optimistic given so made people said they fit as they should. Cue immense sadness. No, they don’t. Helping out my ladies in the spirit of Elise Meyers, I’m 5’5, I wear a 14/16 in jeans, leggings etc. I have beautifully athletic thighs and calves. My midsection is a ‘B’ belly, so I ordered an XL.<br /><br />When I opened the package and held them up, they appeared that they would fit my 13 yr old 😳 But hey they’re leggings, so they stretch, right?! Well yes, but I felt like I was squishing a king sized pillow into a lumbar pillow cover. No bueno. In order to properly manage to escape the grasp of the fabric around my legs, I had to peel them off my rear and sit on the bed to properly remove them. Let me tell you, once they were coming off I felt like a blanket in a space saver bag receiving a fresh taste of air after a year in storage. Whew. 😅<br /><br />So if you’re smaller on the size chart, go for it. I’d definitely order a size up if you’re any type of athlete with muscular legs though!"
1.0,Made cheaply and the fabric is awful and looks washed
1.0,The lines on the shirt are all mis matched .. so upset
1.0,"Do not buy! It's not worth the money! First off it does not appear as it does in the picture and most importantly its damaged. This is not even Silver, It is white and discolored and with a big dent and chip on it. I bought two of these earring this silver one and the green. Both are the same issue. I need my money back this is not worth 9 dollars, and will surely have to call amazon, I cant even wear these, nor did I purchased a damaged product."
1.0,material feels like plastic and too rough to wear under clothing
1.0,the jewelry is too small and the clip ones are hard to get in
1.0,I understand the product is made of polyester but I’ve bought plenty of polyester clothing and these pants were extremely thin and cheap considering the price I paid. Not soft or as comfortable as promised. Not happy with these sweats.
1.0,"I understand that these types of dresses or not very costly but what about quality standards?! Not only did this dress arrive with a hole in it, but, the fit was not good. The gathers on the back of the dress were placed way too low. Very poor quality!"
1.0,The zipper broke already unfortunately. 😔
1.0,"These are not 20G, they are more like 16G I will be returning for a refund"
1.0,"These things immediately started falling apart.  I have an older pair that's probably 3 yrs old that are in better shape!  I'm now adding an additional comment two weeks later:  it was only the black pair that seemed &#34;faulty&#34;, pink pair has been fine."
1.0,too baggy...didn't fit well.

1.0,Letters fall off
1.0,The metal piece that clasps it together fell off after wearing it only 3 times. Not worth it!
1.0,I do not recommend. Colored coating started flaking off in less than a month.
1.0,Cute but all decorative items are glued on and fell off first wash.
1.0,Really wanted to give this hat to my son for Christmas but the Polo emblem is so small on the hat that it really isn’t visible or maybe it was the color that I choose but I returned it
1.0,Waste of money. Size chart is bogus.  Enough stretch and material for an elephant. Could be one size fits all? Great material and concept if you size down by two. Don't follow chart!
1.0,"The t shirt is very poor quality. Once you wash it, it’s gone."
1.0,"Fit great, look great, but durability is an issue. The clip broke after 2 days of wearing them, the clip on the back right-side. I only wore them to work which I sit at a desk all day so no strenuous activity, then wore them to Church in which the clip broke. Sucks because the color and fit were fantastic but the durability is a miss."

1.0,I was disappointed I don’t have time to return. It but it’s a price of crap for $8 I wanted a head wrap
1.0,"The shoes were fine but the Velcro lasted about a month before it completely gave way. An adult may be able to be gentle with it, but asking a kid to be careful pulling the Velcro is not going to happen with single stitching. Unless this stitching changes these shoes are not worth buying. The shoe itself held up just fine and could stand a lot more abuse but the Velcro only lasted a month."
1.0,This is a Horrible product.....false information is on the description and the dress is extremely poor quality and it feels like the sewing is done in the oddest parts!  Poorest product ever purchased.  Also they are fraudulent with regard to the cost of return....when you try to return it says you need to pay and after paying $30  for shipping and handling they also charged for return.  Misrepresentation!  Stay away from Amazon dresses

1.0,"These lenses are not good quality. I bought the lenses June 24th and put them in my sunglass frames a few days later. I take very good care of my sunglasses to keep from scratching them. A couple of days ago I noticed small specs on my lenses, at first I thought they were just dirty, then I realized that the tint on the lenses was coming off. I can't return now since it's past the return window. I will not buy again or recommend this product."
1.0,Very chip product  not what I expect low quality stuff not usable
1.0,These clothes never fit always very small
1.0,"This bracelet is super cute, comfortable, and easy to put on. However, it's life span was less than 2 weeks of wearing. The small thread holding the beads on frayed quickly resulting in it breaking in a manner that couldn't really be fixed. Fishing line would be a quality alternative to improve value and durability. Because of its short lifespan I wouldn't want to gift it."
1.0,Sleeves way too tight. Shirt is not like picture shown.
1.0,I bought this for my sister and her feet are wide and when she tried on the boots the squished her feet in the middle. She is size 9 and size 10 didn't help.

1.0,"This belt does not tie easily at all, and is consistently coming loose all day."
1.0,Horrible. Bought this for my mom and it arrived so crammed in the box by the manufacturer that the stone was crushed in the front. I asked for a replacement and that one to was broken just the same way. I have returned both and await a refund. I’d give 0 stars if I could.
1.0,The bar wasn’t long enough
1.0,It is way too big covers my entire face almost
1.0,The seller is not Honest at all. Photos are not the same of real products at all !!! I got the NAVY color. its totally the different. I need refund
1.0,This hat is like a flat billed 10 gallon hat. It sticks off my head like a foot. There's no adjusting it to fit correctly. Just poorly made.
1.0,"It's not long and flowy, like the picture.  The material is a weird, rough texture that seems as if it would be hot.  It's VERY, VERY wide and VERY, VERY short.  I have a large chest,  which I normally have to size up for.  It makes it too short in the front.  On the model, it looks like it hits below the hips.  I'm 5'9"", and it doesn't.  The material is too stiff to be flowy.  Maybe if you washed it more?  I got the black.  Maybe the other colors have a better length and material, since the ratings are so high?  If you're looking for a short, boxy top, this would work."
1.0,"I bought these for my daughters and they were SO big, not necessarily size, but the height(?) of them from their ears was ridiculous. They would be too much for me. The meal is cheap as well and the gold would chip off like paint leaving ""gold"" and black pieces in my kids' ears leaving them with infections. They're ugly and  a health hazard. Luckily I caught it early."
1.0,WONT BUY AGAIN
1.0,This product never worked.  The battery is working but the watch doesn’t keep good time.  It’s like the watch hands are too close to each other and it keeps them from moving properly.  The watch style/band is just what I was looking for but the mechanism is not working properly.

1.0,There way to small

1.0,The band lost its glitter wrap a week after purchasing. Still issuable but the band itself is garbage.
1.0,Bad quality broke
1.0,I’m sorry but this brush did practically nothing for my felt hat. All it did was move the dust and lint around. I wanted to like it based on all the rave reviews. I ended up just using tape to clean my hat after waiting to get this brush and then being so frustrated it didn’t work.
1.0,Too small even after adding the extender that comes with it
1.0,Did not like fit or cut meant for someone over 6’2 also fabric is not breathable for exercise
1.0,"The wire is thin and flimsy which is not the best when trying to insert. This ring cut the inside of my piercing and made me bleed. I'm not new to piercings, I know these things happen but even after giving it a second try I could not get it into my belly button"

1.0,Not accurate with the size chart.
1.0,"The worst article of clothing I have ever bought on Amazon. Proportions were so bad. The book area would be for someone with absolutely nothing, I don't have much to talk about and it was so bad."

1.0,Muy censillo
1.0,My watch didn't fit into the case.
1.0,Does not fit well. I’m a very standard so 4-6 and this dress does not fall as it should or as its pictured. Looks like a bodycon.
1.0,Cheap Chinese junk.  And yes it is hidden in the add there is only one.  It says for boots.  Does not work on boots.  It is what I would call a deceptive ad.  Either the ad should be updated or the product removed.  No instructions.  What a waste of 12 dollars.  I could have bought two Starbucks coffees.
1.0,"Really cute but left a trail of feathers everywhere we went....flimsy, fell apart instantly"
1.0,Not for a 1 year olds head.

After laser surgery, I no longer need prescription sunglass lenses, so I just wanted something that was high quality with a good selection of features. The Rudy Project line looked like the best option.  Several hundred dollars later, I have discovered that I could not be more wrong. Hopefully this review information will assist others in not making the same mistake I did.<br /><br />The sunglasses come in a very nice box with a hard case and carrying bag for the glasses themselves that doubles as a microfiber cleaning cloth. The case has an extra flap that carries two pairs of spare lenses. Given that the Rydon line is well-lauded for the ability to swap out lenses in the frames on an as-needed basis, this is a very nice feature. There are options to purchase dozens of different lenses directly from the site, from golfing lenses to nearly-transparent protective lenses to hyper-dark sunglass lenses suitable for alpine eye protection.<br /><br />The lenses test out on my side to provide very good UV-A and UV-B blocking and the shape of the frame and lenses minimizes edge light for a comfortable and adjustable fit. Some lenses, such as the Polar 3FX polarized lenses come with anti-reflective back coating to reduce the reflection of light on the back of the lenses and the coating does an excellent job of this. The lenses are impact-resistant per several national standards in various countries. Finally, the multi-laser lenses have an appealing look with a sweep of mirrored color depending on the viewing angle, though the multi-laser lenses that I have acquired do not have an anti-reflective back coating.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />Bit of a screw loose...<br /><br />My use of the sunglasses includes for driving and hiking, as well as everyday use. When not worn on my face, the glasses are stored in their micro-fiber bag and that in the hard case to avoid any squashing or other damage. I found it somewhat interesting that after a few days of folding and unfolding the earpieces, the screws at the temple were quickly becoming more and more loose. Within a few weeks, I quickly discovered that it was necessary to re-tighten these screws with pretty much every three wears otherwise they would become looser and looser and eventually come out of the bottom of the hinge piece.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />Lens (lack of) quality...<br /><br />Rudy project has a -HUGE- range of lens options for the Rydon sunglass line. Combined with the &#34;Replacement Lens Guarantee&#34; I read about, I had no qualms (at the time) over purchasing two pairs of frames and lenses. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />The red-mirrored lenses started exhibiting prolific micro-cracks within a week despite being stored only in climate-controlled home rooms and in my pocket while out. With the micro-cracks, when direct sunlight hits the lens at any angle, it reflects off the micro-cracks and creates a splay of reflected light from inside the lens, obstructing vision quite effectively. Not only is this annoying, but it endangered my life at one point when the reflections off the cracks in the lenses obstructed my vision when driving.<br /><br />The other original set was a pair of Polar 3FX polarized lenses with a titanium mirror coating (plain non-colored mirroring). My first discovery with these was that an examination of the polarization revealed it to be inconsistent across the lens. Quick comparison of cross-polarization with a standard test showed that the lens had several &#34;hot spots&#34; where the polarization was not complete. It was not misaligned, it was literally missing in those spots.<br /><br />But that was not the only issue. Within a few weeks' time frame, growing spots of darkness in the mirror coating began to develop. Looking at the front of the glasses, these were non-mirrored dark spots. Looking through the glasses, these resulted in bright spots in the lens where the extra light reduction of the mirroring was not occurring. All of the light that was normally reflected by the mirror surface was going through the lens instead, creating a very inconsistent view of the world besides the glasses looking quite ugly while being worn now with big dark spots on the otherwise mirrored lenses.<br /><br />Washing with mild detergent was ineffective at correcting the issue with the Polar 3FX lenses and so I lived with it for a while while ordering a new set of lenses directly from Rudy Project's site. After all, better to have something than nothing at all while getting replacements, since replacing them requires shipping the prior lenses back.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />Take two... or three, four, and five<br /><br />The cost of lenses on the Rudy Project site directly ranges from about $55 to $90 for non-prescription, non-reader lenses. They have a very large selection of options for look, light transmission, and intended use. Thinking that maybe there had been some kind of issue with the Amazon purchase of these sunglasses, I took the option to purchase three new pairs of lenses from Rudy Project directly. Third, fourth, and fifth time should be fine, right? Take very special care of them and it would be okay?<br /><br />After a short time, a set of mirrored blue, mirrored green, and a new pair of Polar 3FX polarized lenses arrived.  The Polarized lenses and the blue lenses were placed immediately into the frames and the green lenses were inspected and stored in the lens holders provided by the case sent by Rudy Project. The microfiber glasses bags were well-washed and rinsed prior to this and the lens holders were never used before. I know that chemicals are rarely good for anything, so ensuring a pristine start was important to me.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the mirrored green lenses imparted a color tint. Nothing on the original sale process indicated this. It was annoying, but livable, however more bad that nothing told me they would do this.<br /><br />Then after about a week of wearing the mirrored blue lenses outdoors, a stumble on a root in the mountains sent them flying off my face into grass. No problem. Walk over, pick them up. I've had many, many pair of sunglasses fall onto everything from grass to gravel to asphalt before and even had those annoying little dings in some of the cheap ones from rocky falls of substantial height.<br /><br />Odd.  Why did I have a big blue in my right line of vision?<br /><br />A quick inspection of the lenses discovered a millimeter-long gouge in the mirrored surface of the right lens as well as numerous other tiny scratches that caused the mirrored coating to flake off at the edges of the scratches along both lenses. This from a five foot drop into -GRASS-. Not rocks. Not cement or asphalt. No sticks, nothing sharp or hard. Just GRASS. One week and these lenses were destroyed.<br /><br />At home I promptly set them aside and went the rest of the day with the polarized lenses, intending to see about the lens guarantee soon. The end of the day brought the next unpleasant surprise. While I had been wearing them, the same problem with the mirrored surface developed with this pair of lenses. Given that they were on my face, I am at a loss to explain how this occurred. They were fine when they went on, and by the end of a few hours outside in the sun, they had dark spots on the front with no mirroring. So another pair of lenses to probably replace. I'd have to deal with the tinted color of the green lenses. Which I took out of the case specifically made for them to find a bubble under the mirroring on one lens that caused a separation of the mirroring there and a very distinct defective section as a result.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />But they guarantee them!  Or do they?<br /><br />Rudy Project has two guarantees. One is a 90-day money back guarantee. However the lenses must be in perfect condition to take this up and so that would not be honored on damaged lenses.<br /><br />The second guarantee is a bit more sinister. They will replace even damaged lenses if you ship them back with an accurate address and a check for a &#34;small handling fee&#34;. Literally, to quote from their current web site: &#34;Whatever the reason, you can replace your scratched or damaged lenses direct from Rudy Project for a small handling fee.&#34;<br /><br />It was already annoying that FIVE pairs of lenses managed to fail to last more than a month each, so even something like a $4.99 handling fee on top of the cost of shipping the lenses back was annoying to consider. Then I went to their web site and choked on something as I read:<br /><br />&#34;To have your lenses replaced under our replacement lens guarantee, please send your damaged lenses and a check for $24.95...&#34;<br /><br />Right. So the handling is AT LEAST 28% THE COST OF NEW LENSES, and that's only on the very costly ones like Polar 3FX. Apparently &#34;Open package. Look at old lenses to see that they are really real. Process an order for the new ones to the correct address.&#34; is done by celebrities or something, since that 15-minute process apparently is done by somebody paid about $100 an hour.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />Failure, failure, failure, and more failure, on top of expense and failure.<br /><br />In all the time I have purchased things, performed reviews, done evaluations, and given public information to assist in purchase decisions, I have NEVER seen a product that has earned a one-star review. Then Rudy Project came along. Unfortunately, I can't really say that the product alone earns the review. In this case, I have to apply this review to the whole company, since a good chunk of the problem is company-wide.<br /><br />At $25 per lens replacement with five pairs of lenses surviving two weeks on average, and some dying within one day of use, the average cost of these sunglasses is well over $650 per year on getting replacement &#34;guaranteed&#34; lenses. What is their guarantee? Apparently they guarantee that if you send them more money, they will send you more defective and inferior product so that you can send them more money in a few weeks.<br /><br />The $25 lens replacement is the only option at all as well. There is no warranty that I found for defective on arrival or anything similar. This implies clearly that the company does not stand behind their product as a quality, lasting item and may only be out there to wrack in as much money as they can from unsuspecting cads.<br /><br />»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»<br />In the end, nothing good to say<br /><br />A lot of pretty lenses, a lot of fancy material in the frames, but with the frames falling apart and the lenses not lasting more than two weeks without dumping money into replacing them, all that shine is useless. As a whole, I can only emphatically recommend avoiding Rudy Project products as a whole with hopes that they will eventually not be a useless money sink with eggshell-like reliability.<br /><br />As always, this review is my own experiences and knowledgeable information. Two separate sets of Rudy Project products, one from Amazon, one from Rudy Project directly, and the same exact issues with both tends to indicate a wide-sweeping problem. This is also the first review on these products on Amazon, so that is something to consider. The glasses I bought on Amazon were the same Rydon models, but the product page for my specific purchase is now dead. Constantly placing the same products under new ASINs is a strong indication of potential troubles that are trying to be hidden, so we shall see how this comes back."
1.0,I ordered large and I received a small! I have NO instructions on where to send it back.
1.0,The defective item is not worth the money.
1.0,"Purchased because the sunglasses looked like a bargain, but the frame snapped after wearing only a few times. I was careful with them hoping they would last for a while. Disappointed."
1.0,Only came with 3goggles not 4
1.0,It fits like a coffee sack no real fit just sort of bland and material is very thin so you’ll need a long slip!!!
1.0,Sizing of products are not true sizes!
1.0,"Product came in great. Been wearing for about a month. Now looks like the film is coming off. Very disappointing. And it figures I am beyond the 30 days... emailed back and forth with the rep from the company they sent me out replacements for the Blue lens. keeping fingers crossed. red ones have been good now for over 30.... now three months of red lenses and they did the same as the blue... wore to the beach and seems to be the salt air that is the issue, did not swim in just hung out on beach for the day.... for the money you will get a years worth of lenses for the 4 colors"
1.0,"I bought these gloves for warehouse work, handling boxes. The first day, most of the grip on the palms and fingers was worn away, and after 3 days the fingers were worn through to the fabric and the web between thumb and forefinger was torn. I'm very disappointed in these gloves and will not be purchasing another pair"
1.0,"These are not adjustable. The tiotle says ""single bar double bar."" This led me to believe they were single bar on one side and double on the other. But, no. It's a typo. They are single bar on each side, which was useless for my project. I had a limited timeline and I ended up having to bike 6 miles to the store on a day when I did NOT have the time for this to get correct ones for my project."
1.0,This picture looks mint green and it is not!!!
1.0,Beautiful earring but so far I’ve bought it 3 times and the clasps are defective.  They are extremely hard to open or close to the point it’s almost imposible. Save yourself time and don’t purchase.
1.0,How do you spell End Game wrong???!!! I'm so disappointed and will be returning this shirt!!!😡
1.0,Thin material but didn't mind that as much as it did not have elastic around the gathered empire waist
1.0,"It feels like cheap material, I wouldn’t recommend using your money."
1.0,I like the shirt but it does not fit as expected and it cost to return it so I ended up keeping this too little shirt.
1.0,No megusto porque nose que zise es no tiene zise
1.0,Fabric quality was just okay and I don’t know if I got a defective one but a gap formed that I couldn’t get rid of. The sides don’t appear to be identical at all. It was very weird and unfixable. For reference I got a size L and it fit well other than this. I normally wear an 8 or 10 and am 5’4 about 160 lbs.
1.0,"Dont buy it because if you do not get the right size you will not get a full refund.  I wear a large ordered a large and it was the size of a petite person, should have ordered a XXL....not happy at all"
1.0,The mask is poorly made and looks not at all like the picture.<br /><br />Also the shipping took three weeks!
1.0,Wasn’t satisfied for the price
1.0,"Took a very long time to arrive. The stones are beautiful, but the metal parts are crudely finished and ill-fitting."
1.0,Really disappointed. Looks nothing like the picture. Material not as expected either
1.0,Ordered for last minute bridal shower and it didn’t have the wrap around it
1.0,The case and microfiber cloth were nice.  Unfortunately I can’t review the sunglasses because THERE WERE NONE IN THE PACKAGE!
1.0,They are already falling apart
1.0,The ends on this strap are not leather.  I am not a fan of false advertisement. How do I return this item?
1.0,not satisfied at all because I was not feeling appreciated when given me sunglasses absolutely no cans instead of 1 nylon bag not like anyone.
1.0,"Nice quality sweater, although does not fit as pictured, shirt is very short in length. Going to return."
1.0,I where a men's lg hat and this is too small for me.  I could see if I was a xl or xxl but I am not.
1.0,Did not like garbage
1.0,Clasp broke 1st day! Disappointed!
1.0,Broke just a few days after getting it.
1.0,Does not change colors
1.0,"These don’t work. If you want them to attach to shoes, that’s  not gonna happen. Not possible."
1.0,"WTF! Never mind that it's 2 pieces, but no where did it show these white elves or whatever they are.  I couldn't see them from the outside of the package either or I never would have given it to her. Now she loves it.🙄 The skirt is too short too. This was supposed to be a birthday dress. I would have sent it back as soon as I saw it was 2 pieces but I was guilted by the thought of returns going into landfills, but if I can get it away from her, I'm getting my money back.😡"
1.0,"The captive beed is about as captive as captive gets... We are two brains that opted against pursuing beating the entangling of the said beed, since we succeeded not.<br />Do yourself a favor: take ten dollars, throw it out in the trash can, and avoid the frustration of having to figure out the faulty manufacturing of this item.<br />I'd send it back if i didn't think so little of the seller."
1.0,The connection pieces are not very strong and make a lot of noise .. vary bad 👎🏻
1.0,"I read reviews outside of Amazon.com that Vileda are comfortable.  Should I have read the Amazon reviews first?  Probably... Although there are no reviews from the U.S., I translated them and apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks these are too small and overpriced.  No big deal;  I will just return them and pick up a pair at Target. No harm, no foul."
1.0,The print on the mask isn't clear and it is very large the nose will go halfway across your face the mouth will line up at your chin I don't suggest it unless you just need a mass then flipping inside out
1.0,"It's not an actual bleached outskirts with a print on top. It's a cheap polyester and the whole thing is a ""print"" if that makes sense."
1.0,it runs small and shorter than the picture.  It's not really tunic length and can hardly call it &#34;loose&#34;.
1.0,Of I could give this a zero I would! Horrible fabric and screen printing! Sewn crooked didn’t even try in immediate return!!
1.0,The fabric is so rough and itchy. Do not recommend it. I am a small and this shirt is like xl..
1.0,Said it would fit my 42 mm Apple Watch but it was too big. And I thought I got a large band but it was still too tight.
1.0,Can’t say if my friend liked it or not because she never received it. Looks pretty though :(
1.0,Cheap plastic frame was broken before I could even try them on.Did not like the style either.
1.0,family objects to cooking food where i just put my used slippers they heated well and felt great but have no place to reheat them
1.0,Go two sizes higher that what you normally are. Material is extremely see through . Disappointed it didn’t work out . Will be returning item.
1.0,This hat was supposed to come with &#34;sizing tape if too large&#34;. It didn't. Too inexpensive to hassle with return but disappointing nonetheless.
1.0,Very cheap materials and work ..<br />Bad measurements...
1.0,Very cheap looking :(
1.0,Material is so weird and smells — sizing off — avoid
1.0,Apparently these are not US sizes. Orders a 3x and they look like a large.
1.0,I have a short torso and a defined waist yet it still rolled on me. This sucked!!! Wore it twice and lost it.
1.0,These are like baby doll socks
1.0,This watch is horrible it won't allow you to set it stop making speak out loud for my elderly father so is this useless
1.0,These earrings were falling apart while I was putting them on. The pearls are glued and we’re falling out as I put them on. Not a good purchase.
1.0,ordered a 3-pack of all black because the black in the multipack with 2 other colers fit perfect. These are AT LEAST 2-3 inches shorter in length. No consistency what so ever.
1.0,Was not expecting these earrings to be this small all about a 1/2 inch. Looking at the picture you provided it's pretty deceiving. For $18. Something's wrong here
1.0,"This product pictures are terribly altered to fool military into buying this, the pattern is close enough to match but the coloring is too bright and orange toned. Huge waste of time buying this with winter right around the corner."
1.0,Glasses broke from a drop of three feet high. Terrible quality and a complete waste of money. Wish I could post a picture but I forgot and they already took the trash out for the day.
1.0,"I was really excited for this product to arrive, it arrived on time but when I opened the package it was nothing of what I expected. By looking at the price point I knew that this won't be as high quality of course you get what you pay for kinda but this product in picture looks way high quality than in reality. It's very very cheap looking product also not to mention the size of it. It's HUGE! it you are someone who likes big chunky jewelry which basically covers your entire neck than you will enjoy this product more than I did. But for me it was big NO NO."
1.0,Do not like it
1.0,"Super cheap fabric, and one of the seams ripped when trying them on. Returning."
1.0,"Great for cleavage, but it seemed to cut my cup in half. Felt comfortable, but cup size was a bit off. It made me look very odd in and out of my shirts"
1.0,They looked cheap and the fit was sloppy.
1.0,I've had this for a number of weeks and one came broken and have since broken 2 more. The metal is very soft. Not worth the money.
1.0,I never bought this or received it
1.0,"Bought these for my wife, they came today and besides not looking like the photo, as soon as we took them out of the package the entire house instantly stunk like a harsh chemical.  They look poorly made, and they smell from about 15 feet away.  If you're about to add them to your cart, think again."
1.0,Not worth the money I paid.
1.0,"This shirt has really small arms. I ordered 3x, because 2x normally fits. I can not even get the sleeves on."
1.0,"The material was cheap, flimsy,  and see thru ish. The fit was tight, terrible. Save your money. Only positive the color was a nice red. Back it went."
1.0,"Everything was just so tiny , I'M thinking about sending it back . I felt like I was ripped off .....not buying any more bags online"
1.0,Ordered a size 8-10.<br />Size delivered was 6+<br />So thin you can see through the seat.<br />Sad little girl on her birthday.
1.0,Bent and broke a week into using
1.0,Looks like a girl sweater is not even fluffy not worth ur money
1.0,After 1 wash they lost their luster. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,"Wish I could give zero stars. Strap wouldn't come off my watch. Had to break it off, and now my $150 watch is broken. I'm really mad."
1.0,Not what I expected.  Too big.
1.0,Sizing way off- ordered 2 sizes up per teviews and still too small -
1.0,"Should have believed that items run small but I didn't think that small, especially for larger sizes.<br /><br />Read all details."
1.0,Looks and feels like a nightgown.
1.0,"The pair I received was not really the same style as pictured. The jean stayed skinny past the knee and flared below the calves. Awkward... What's worse, the right leg had a lopsided seam. The outer seam twisted toward the front like the pattern was cut wrong. Boo! The length was good. I normally would go for a shorter inseam, but I wanted to wear these with platforms and wedges for a 70's look. Not bellbottomy enough."
1.0,The jacket was way too small and tight it's nice but doesn't fit
1.0,Everything I send my daughter to school with one of the lanyards she comes back with the bead off.  This defeats the purpose of the lanyard.
1.0,Not good. Hoodie was a gift and it was way too small. Too short in the sleeves and the waist.
1.0,This product is horrible. I bought it for my daughter considering the pattern with the ballerina’s on it. The medium is too large for an adults face. It lays horribly. And it is a shame because the pattern is cute and the material is actually nice. But don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,"Product description shows earrings that bend open.  I purchased them for a daith piercing that cannot use traditional captive bead earrings.  The larger sets do open as shown, but the smaller 2 sets do not.  Those were the ones that I wanted to use."
1.0,"The zipper was busted. As soon as I tried it on and zipped it up, the zipper came undone from the middle, leaving a gaping hole in the center with the zipper head at the top and the zipper stuck at the bottom. That was not a fun predicament to try and untangle myself from. I returned the item."
1.0,The legs stretched out but they rode up in back. One pair had holes after one wearing. Had to toss out as useless trash
1.0,Cheap material. Looks like a parachute. I couldn’t put t on. Will be returning
1.0,Do not buy this product.  It's a one size fits all that is made for infants at best. I'm 5' 105 pounds and the thing would not fit to save my life.  Save it for a child.
1.0,This speaker only works whole plugged in. We charged the battery for 24 hours and it won’t work if you unplug it.
1.0,The bracelet is totally cute but it turned my wrist green after 2 hours of wearing. Very disappointed with the quality.
1.0,Sadly I would not purchase this item again.  Not made very well and the elastic stretched after putting it on once or twice on my very small wrist . I was only able to wear this a couple times.
1.0,Very small with no give to the fabric.
1.0,It’s not long like the picture shows- it’s short and one size smaller than it should be- I donated it - lesson learned
1.0,"This dress is a piece of crap! It’s like an old stretched out long T-shirt and it’s paper thin.The line fit right under my chest like a maternity dress. If I could rate it 0 stars I would. The vendor would not refund my money, so DON’T WASTE UR TIME OR MONEY! I’ve seen other dresses like this but they weren’t from this vendor, don’t use this vendor!!"
1.0,"The neck of this t-shirt is unusually wide and after one washing the collar was misshapen.  Also, this might have some bamboo fabric but it is an itchy shirt to wear.  Feels like some sort of polyester is mixed in.  Would return it but my time is more important than $20."
1.0,"I was so excited to find these pants! I've been looking all over for a pair like these when I received them I was extremely sad. First it took over a week, which is almost an eternity in this day and age to receive them. Secondly when I opened the package and pulled them out, a size large bottom looked like it was an XS! They run so small I wished I would have read the reviews because I would not have purchased these. Very disappointed."
1.0,It was to small it said 5x and it barely fit my mom who’s a medium
1.0,Skimpy and thin/see thru material.
1.0,Pinched the inside of my nose to the point that the whole rip of my nose was sore to the touch and if I moved it
1.0,These are cute but realistically they really hurt I could only leave them in for about an hour
1.0,It fell apart very quickly
1.0,"After one wash, this sweatshirt is garbage. It washes up horribly, pilling everywhere, discoloration and the fabric shrunk. 10/10 would not recommend!"
1.0,Hate this dress. Terrible condition and nothing like the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I do not like leaving bad reviews, but I definitely think what happened deserves one: I received the wrong item (two pink bags and two black ones when they should've been all pink) and some of the items were missing (toiletry and shoe bag). Also, I paid for one-day shipping, so hopefully I get it back when I return the item."
1.0,Fell apart in less than 1 hour of wearing it!! Horrible quality.
1.0,"i like the fabric but the block pattern makes your shoulders look weird.<br />also, dealing with the seller regarding returns is not easy as they are out of country."
1.0,This is the worst thing I have ever received from amazon. I am extremely disappointed. It looks nothing like the picture. You can’t even read the words on the front.
1.0,Not true sizing; very cheaply made. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
1.0,"Very poor quality material, and big in the bottom part of the dress.  Looked like Halloween costume material. I returned it.  Fast response and credit from vendor."
1.0,"Adorable but, they fell out several times while I was wearing them. They just slip thru with no backing."
1.0,"Material is thick, not stretchy at all. My 3 year old who is slightly tall for her age barely fit into size 4-6 yr with no breathing room. Can't imagine her dancing in it so we are returning."
1.0,The wolf tooth is nice
1.0,"Unless the models are extremely small the shirt is not as long as it shows in the picture, I am 5'2&#34;. The material is very thin and does not wear well at all. I do not recommend this shirt at all"
1.0,Really small and cheap looking
1.0,There was nothing inside the watch to make it work. It’s only for the look
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter who normally wears a size 12, I bought the 14/16 and it was way too small."
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. Cheap, short, tight...not worth it at all don't waste your time or money!"
1.0,The sizing of these is a joke. I’m 5’9” 200lbs and I literally couldn’t even fit them over my hips.
1.0,"Not very high quality fabric-extremely thin and almost see through. Looks longer in pic, short in real life. Disappointed with quality."
1.0,"I was very disappointed with the charm.  I love the sentiment, but I don't like the looks of it.  It did NOT look like it did in the picture.  It looked like a sticker rather than having it engraved the way the picture looks...the last two words were even smaller than the others.  And the bottom of my charm looked like it was dirty or had dried up glue on it.  I would never order this again."
1.0,Hard to size even after measuring.
1.0,"I really wanted to like these earrings, I really did. Unfortunately, within 3 days of purchasing them, the stones fell out. I also noticed a small imperfection with the soldering on one earring, which is pretty noticeable considering these are not large pieces of jewelry. Overall, very poorly made and I am pretty disappointed in this purchase. Not worth the money at all. I hope you didn't buy these for anyone for Valentine's Day."
1.0,Way to small and I ordered an xl.
1.0,I really loved the way this looked but after a week of having it a thread unraveled that was essentially keeping it together.
1.0,Stopped working the 1st day
1.0,"This is a very cool looking ring, but I could not wear it, which is very disappointing. I tried for several days, but  the points on the sun kept cutting into my skin."
1.0,Picture looks really soft and comfortable but it is not
1.0,I looked like a potato. Very heavy material.
1.0,Size chart is way off. I ordered an XXL for my Father in Law who is a 38. They were way too small. The cost to return is very expensive. Would not recommend this seller.
1.0,They streach and stay streched out to much
1.0,The shoes were fine. What wasn’t fine was the smell. She shoes smelled like they came from an ashtray. It’s nasty. Very disappointed with the shipper of this item. Not good Amazon.
1.0,I am extremely dissatisfied with the purchase of this product....the pieces doesn’t fit together and I can’t connect two of the pieces. It doesn’t work putting all the three pieces as one.
1.0,Very thin fabric. Does not appear to be double layer.
1.0,Once you opens a metal spring was bent
1.0,"Product i received is not what the website and pictures describe, had to return"
1.0,Not true .925 Sterling silver it turns finger green
1.0,This isn't sterling silver i brought it and in a month it lost the silver to expose a cooper color i sent it back
1.0,This is way too small and I am not a large person
1.0,"you have to order 4 times bigger than your size, so I have this item and will not be able where until I lose about 40 pounds with out it, totally defeats the purpose."
1.0,Too cheap looks like cotton material but it is stretchy and shiny.
1.0,It keeps falling off at the edge
1.0,"this bodysuit came on the sides ripped, I don’t recommend buying it"
1.0,Returned...Doesn't look like picture. But great return policy. Customer service was awesome!
1.0,"It literally just now arrived, and as soon as I opened the package I saw it was broken"
1.0,"while i understand these are really incredibly inexpensive, these are the equivalent to the stupid toy-in-the-quarter-machine-at-the-grocery-store.actually, cheaper...the ones in the picture at least make an attempt at looking &#34;fake metal&#34; ... do not look anything at all like the picture .. these are carnvinal plastic. the &#34;stars and flower-things&#34; are not even recognizable the way these are portrayed in the photo... these ar"
1.0,"The material is extremely thin and gives no support to my belly.  Also, the butt part shows every wrinkle and bulge.  I am not happy with my purchase.  You have to cover your butt because any underwear you wear will show through the leggings.  The only good thing about it is they are very soft and stretchy but like I said, there's no support or compression feeling whatsoever.  I'm 5'6"" and 26 weeks pregnant weighing 177 pounds."
1.0,Way too small. Returned
1.0,The material is silky and not sweatsuit material at all. It’s not burgundy it’s red & it looks like something that a older person will wear to church.
1.0,Was missing the two side packs but other than that my daughter loved it
1.0,Received this and it was missing 2 buttons. Can’t seem to find button replacements ether. Sweater is useless now.
1.0,My five-year-old couldn't even get these on they were so tight
1.0,"From the moment I opened the package I knew the lanyard was of poor quality, it didn't last a day."
1.0,I love Kd's but very disappointed in your product.  They broke the 1st week I had them.
1.0,I purchased these wore them and they turned my skin black 3 showers later and my skin is still black. Do not know if this is a toxic dye and the fact that I cannot get it off after 3 showers ad scrubbing is insane<br /><br />Also no way to return….not happy.<br /><br />I need to know how to get dye off and what kind of dye from hell this is<br /><br />DO NOT BUY
1.0,Very disappointing to me as well as to my 5 year old daughter. So excited to try on her new bathing suit that doesn’t fit.  I ordered size 5 and received a size 2.
1.0,cheap not even good for dust rag.
1.0,I can see some marks of makeup on this. Iam going to definitely return it
1.0,"Connection broke where it attached to Fitbit, and almost lost the Fitbit riding motorcycle."
1.0,Horrible product. Zipper broke after 3 months. Most of that time was haning in a closet. Land’s End won’t help because it is Amazon order. Amazon only has 30 day return. Do Not Buy!!!
1.0,"These just aren't warm enough for Alaskan winter activities, even quick ones like taking the outside animals some food and water. The lining is super thin and all my kids have complained that their hands are very cold."
1.0,I ordered this scarf on nov 4th and received it today nov 21 I was expecting a larger scarf and got one the size of a head scarf  very disappointed and does not look like the picture on amazon I would not get another one
1.0,Llega sin la varita no lo compren
1.0,Broke off my dogs collar In 2 days!<br />Other than that I LOVED it
1.0,"Nice package, but CHEAP construction LACK of quality and control, they had drops of the black polarize liquid on the lens. it's like looking thru water. and the legs were loose."
1.0,"With No help, I, me! Was actually Able to set it. On my own!.... UPDATE! I am continually having nothing but problems with this watch. And military time, don't get me started....The Final Straw now is that although it understands that the year is 2020, it is a Day Behind! I spent an entire day thinking it was Saturday, when in actuality, it was Sunday. I've attempted to contact the seller, especially due to their Declaration of such Fabulous Customer Service. Right. Maybe this will get their attention."
1.0,terribly out of shape does not fit a normal person and pocket is way of to the side
1.0,"Didn't fit properly ordered a smaller size,had a different fix and look to the image provided"
1.0,I disliked the fact it does not have a collar and has hook with eye closure. A zipper would be better.
1.0,Not made for big busts.
1.0,The product itself was nice.. however not anywhere close to American sizes.
1.0,They look nothing like the picture and they don’t fit right
1.0,"I did not receive this cuff, I received a cheap imitation of this cuff. Silver was thin and the cuff that hugs the ear was very sharp. I was afraid that it would cut my ear. It was poorly made - grateful that Amazon refunded me my money. Very disappointed"
1.0,Crappy wallet. Ugly markings on the outside. The card slots are impossible to use and cheap.
1.0,Looks so big around the waist.
1.0,"I bought earrings from this same company which I love, but was super disappointed when I got this bracelet. Obviously it's cheap so don't expect it to look like anything else, but costume jewelry...however the color is SO NOT what is in the picture. In the picture it truly looks like a champagne color, but when you get it you should be expecting a much darker brassy color."
1.0,Returned these because they ran way too small. An XL fit closer to a medium than anything else.
1.0,Item was really small.
1.0,"This watch went back immediately. I loved the look, loved the large face, but the band was way too stiff and uncomfortable. I *did* read, in Amazon's description, that the band would loosed up and become less stiff with wear, but I wasn't about to chance it and then not be able to return it. Bottom line, I just didn't like the feel of it on my wrist."
1.0,"It really fooled me, disappointed - looks like sparkles it is just fabric"
1.0,"The style of the boot very appealing & elongated the leg. But I noticed some writing on the toe part like in Sharpy & a price?? Totally took away the ritzy of the high boot. As well as the oreinimental peices on the side of boot, they were they to absolutely serve no purpose yet they weren't even sewn down to the boot to prevent accidents/loose of decor. Very disappointed unfortunately really wanted these but I love how PRIME MAKES ORDERING ONLINE SO FAST, SECURE, FRIENDLY & IF THERE IS A PROBLEM USUALLY THEY WILL HANDEL IT W/O CONSUMOR GETTING HEADACHE!!! THANK YOU"
1.0,I ordered the black and grey as pictured but received a gray and blue one instead.
1.0,"I was so looking forward to this dress! Unfortunately, It’s huge! I could try to get it smaller but I don’t think it’s going to make that big a difference! I definitely recommend you order at least a size smaller than what you normally take! And you’ll probably need a belt with this one. It’s a pretty color and style but it just didn’t work for me."
1.0,Thin material.  Got too small.  Alwsys wear same size.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in this product.  I follow the directions to a T and every single time the bag leaks all over my back.  For the amount of money I spent, you would think it wouldn't leak."
1.0,"Had to return. Socks are on a tight side and slide on a carpet anyway.  Also, my hands slide inside the gloves making the set useless."
1.0,was not as described. completely see through cheap material. DO NOT PURCHASE! way way way too small
1.0,"Clasp is stuck, very cheap looking. Might of just ended up with the lemon."
1.0,"This was exactly what I had been looking for and I was so excited to receive it.  It was great out of the package but after a week it was already showing wear by some of the stitching coming out.  I continued to use and took on a business trip when I noticed the white was rubbing off, as if it had been painted. Needless to say, I was forced to trash it within two months of light use. Definitely not worth the price but it was a great design and I wish the outcome ad been different."
1.0,It was not working so I had to return it
1.0,not compression = gross fabric
1.0,They look good - They are not warm and the XL is like a medium - Not worth it - Stay Away
1.0,"The tallit is made from acrylic, it says imitation wool but it feels cheap and plastic, I was going to give it to my boyfriend but if he embarrassed for him to wear this to shul."
1.0,"My first mistake was NOT reading some of the reviews regarding the sizing. Most “good” reviews are usually from manufacturer. I take a men’s large, ordered & received a 4XL (based on their hat) and it’s so tight it’s pathetic. Don’t buy this pullover, you’ll be disappointed. Why Amazon doesn’t have sizing standards with their vendors is also ridiculous. Now all the wasted time returning goods is also crazy. I WANTED TO GIVE 0 STARS, BUT IT WON’T...👎👎👎👎👎 Five Thumbs Down!"
1.0,Item was too small. I ordered next size up but it was e vfc en smaller.  Sent both back and I'm still waiting on refund.
1.0,"Looks nice, smaller than expected and very weak chain! Broke within 2 days of owning. Not happy"
1.0,"I ordered two headbands as I do a lot of yard work, hoping to help ease the heat, preparing to wear one and have the other on as a backup.  The headband was very thin, and too large to stay put around my forehead.  It did not provide the cooling effect as described."
1.0,Loved fabric! But the largest size was too small.
1.0,Huge! My daughter is 8 years old size 1 is what I order but’s way to big and wide.
1.0,"Purchased to wear with costume, could not wear due to inability to see through the mask."
1.0,Love G shock watches. I have many in different colors. This is an amazing color but you are unable to read the time without hitting the light button WHY
1.0,Bought this for  my niece and the next day the thread came loose and tore.  Poorly<br /> made
1.0,I thought this was bigger. It’s so tiny you can hardly see it on my bracelet. Disappointing
1.0,Horrible.
1.0,Cute but worn for one day and the top snap came off
1.0,The strap broke two months after having it. Wish I could return it.
1.0,runs very small.  Beautiful suit just not for the curvy latin woman
1.0,"Product cost of $36 for 6 bottles.<br />Shipping cost $27.90 for 6 bottles.<br />Big ripoff, as all shipped in 1 box.<br />BEWARE"
1.0,I bought to use as a dressier winter coat and it is very thin and the appearance is very cheap.
1.0,It lifts up when you move your arms which makes it uncompatable and shows stomach
1.0,It reads Women’s but pay attention it also reads Juniors. Guess what! they fit for a really skinny person
1.0,did not hold up. Would not stay up. After 3 washing.  And hung to dry
1.0,"Poor quality glasses.  They fell apart in two places within two months and I am not allowed to return for a replacement or refund, preferring the latter naturally."
1.0,"Don’t waist your money. It doesn’t look like the picture, cheap material, and very unflattering. Overall I was extremely disappointed."
1.0,so small you can't see the charms
1.0,This sports bra ran really really small had to get xl when I wear medium. Gave it to my granddaughter still to small.
1.0,"For the amount of money this cost, it is SO NOT worth it. I have purchased more jewelry from Forever 21 and it was 5x less the amount of money this item costed. Spend money on good useful things."
1.0,This was going to be a late Christmas gift that was supposed to arrive the day after Christmas. It arrived today and I will not be gifting this. It is not flannel or even the fleece in the picture. It is that scratchy crappy ‘velvet’ that they make cheap kids costumes from. Fits horribly and the buttons come off very easily. The wings of freedom is crooked and not the correct color. I am beyond angry with this purchase and it went straight into the garbage. I have been communicating with the seller (they gave me a 30% refund as if that somehow fixes this)  but that does not make up for the terrible item I received. Don’t waste your time getting this.
1.0,"This doesn't even fit my 6 year old cousins head... Who wears these??? Lol<br /><br />Unless you're a new born, these won't fit...."
1.0,Then  Diamond  fell off the second day I wore it !!!  Not Happy at all. !!!
1.0,not advertised size
1.0,Not satisfied. The metal is dark & tarnished.I don't recommend.
1.0,They had a very bad chemical smell that physically made me sick. I almost passed out when I open them I had to wash them with vinegar several times to get the older out. Would not recommend buying them at all.
1.0,I ordered a 2x and am normally an xl maximum and I looked like an overstuffed cannoli
1.0,Would not buy this item poorly made.  Tried to return and our UPS said cancel return and create new label... Did that today and now it's not returnable.  I'm so disappointed as this was purchased for a deaf girl that will not understand.<br /><br />Thanks for the great gift!
1.0,Fabric too limp to hold shape
1.0,Waste of money... broke in half within 5 minutes the first time I wore it.
1.0,It is not a 3x! Does not fit and will cost more than I paid for it just to ship it back! Stay away!
1.0,Came in wrong size
1.0,"While it's a beautiful belt, the size isn't true.  I received a 46.  The overall length is a little short, but the notch holes are more closely to that of a size 44 or even some 42s. In fact, one of my size 44 belts has a longer range of sizing than the Luchengy size 46 that arrived today.  Again though, it is a very beautiful, well made belt that comes in a nice metal gift box.  I just wish it was sized more closely to that of a traditional 46.<br /><br />I am revising my original review which was four stars. I changed it to one star because the belt turned out to be a flimsy piece of garbage after only a few months of wear. The back of it completely broke and failed revealing its ultra-cheap poor quality construction. I highly discourage anyone from buying this low quality thing!"
1.0,Junk! Poor quality!
1.0,Got refunded for this
1.0,"Never had this happen before but they sent me two right feet. Both slippers angle noticeably to the left and neither feels at all comfortable on my left foot. If they were trying to make them ambi-footrous, well that didn't work either. Sorry but they are just not wearable."
1.0,Very cheap! was sad bc it was a gift
1.0,These are very large. My adult husband could wear them. Not kids sizes.
1.0,It’s a nice & comfortable bra for the price.
1.0,I opened the package when it arrived and one of the shoes was broken at the toe connection. Absolute trash!
1.0,Plastic clip broke on the second day of use.  Used on a nylon duty belt for police work and should have worked.  Don't know if it was a fluke or poor workmanship.  Would not suggest for duty belt.
1.0,"Very large...make certain you look at size before buying.  I found someone who liked them, but not for me."
1.0,"This dress is actually made terrible.The fit is the only part about this that was accurate.This is a true to size dress<br />The material is thin and see through.But actually the worst part about this dress is the two wrap ties.When you go to tie it the wrap is not fitted.The only way I could possibly describe it is the way a maternity sling would be.The material doesn't lay fitted.The wrap itself once tied just sticks out from the waist.I tried even twisting the left side of the wrap where the irregularities are to no avail.It is a horrible dress.Not even worth the cheap sale price.Return.The wrap on the bottom of the left side of the dress was clearly seen on possibly,Or just made defective.Clearly would not recommend this dress."
1.0,Way too small. I even sized up one and my daughter still couldn’t get it past her torso.
1.0,Horrible quality and sizing is way off
1.0,"This dress is thin , cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture. So I returned it."
1.0,This is the tiniest joke of a toe ring I have ever seen in my life what a waste of money
1.0,Way too small.  Very tight. I usually wear a large/xlarge. I ordered a 2x and still very tight. Very cute if only it fit.
1.0,"The left thumb hole is sewn closed. I don't know if it's supposed to be this way (like pants pockets come sometimes) but I am afraid to use scissors to cut it open, since the whole thing is a knit fabric and could easily unravel. The gloves feel warm when I put them on. I guess I'll end up sending them back because I don't want to ruin them. I also ordered the matching hat, so I guess I'll send that back too."
1.0,"I ordered based on the sizing chart. First I ordered a medium and it's too small and then ordered a large, and now it's too big. What a waste of time."
1.0,Its not the right size that had been sent to me from the beginning..now I have to find some where to print my label in order to get it back to you when I didn't go through all that or put you through anything in order to obtain the boot...
1.0,IT fell apart the first time that i used it
1.0,It smells like a rotten fish.  I would never carry this in my suitcase or purse.
1.0,paper thin
1.0,"I ordered two different sizes, both horrible quality, didn’t fit, see-through and just really awful. Returned both."
1.0,They suck dont buy them they keep breaking
1.0,This is not what I paid for
1.0,Super cute especially for price. BUT!! comes with sticker stating made with harmful materials may cause infertility... So no.
1.0,The item did not fit on top at all and I am a 32B- it was just awkward and I ordered a large. Instead of returning they issued a 50 percent refund - really did me no good as its sitting in my closet.
1.0,"One of the worst items I have ever bought from Amazon. When I received the item, about 8 out of the 40 actually worked and out of those only about 2 had a strong battery usage left.<br /><br />Basically, I paid $8.00 to order something and immediately throw it away.<br /><br />I got what I paid for I suppose. Perhaps this one is on me."
1.0,"All of the butterflies came off, cheaply made!"
1.0,"The shorts dont look like picture at all, they are completely diferent!"
1.0,IT WAS REALLY WEIRD LOOKING AND THE CUP AREA OF THE BRA WAS TOO WIDE THAT IT EXTENDED OUTWARD
1.0,"Bought this larger than usual, since I'm usually 2XL or 3XL. Man, putting it on was an ordeal and the zipper is like 10-12 inches apart. It does not fit my 15-year old, 5'10"" son!!<br /><br />Just don't bother with this."
1.0,Does not hold shape. Turtleneck looks like it is stretched out after wearing twice.  Very dissatisfied with quality for price !
1.0,First i bought two in this shoe<br />First one came okay one set of glue on the shoe lace.<br />Second one i can't sell it to the person that order it<br />Because the glue for sowlin you can see it all you see is glue on the shoe.<br />And the shoe material not so great the second one looks cheap dont know why<br />Can't use it can't sell it<br />Terrible this shoe is.<br />And the tongue of the shoe shapeless
1.0,Too tight & uncomfortable
1.0,"The product is NOT as pictured. Instead of having stones offset as if in orbit, it's just a straight line of colored stones all the same size. Very disappointing."
1.0,This product is nothing like a jacket and more like a spandex shirt. Then when you return it they expect you to pay for over seas shipping which is as much as I paid for the product. This is NOT A JACKET PEOPLE it’s stretchy cotton and unless your a teenager or a twig it’s not going to fit
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4aed76e676afc2b62f931056837a3a35]] This item is horrible. The color is not as pictured at all. And the fabric is extremely cheap. DO NOT buy this item
1.0,This top reminds me of parachute material it's horrible The arms and the chest area is skin tight I ordered three sizes larger and it's still too small. Don't waste your time or your money
1.0,Arrived in the mail and in the picture it shows the tank on a woman. I was extremely disappointed when I opened and it was a child's size and it took 3-4 weeks just to get here. Never again!
1.0,Horrible!!  End Game horribly misspelled!!
1.0,Qulity of this product is not good
1.0,JUNK NOT WORTH THE MONEY SENT BACK
1.0,The sleeves were very belled.
1.0,dont buy!!<br /><br />Received another jeans&gt; Not this one.<br />It wasnt even ripped btw
1.0,looks and feels so cheap. The color is not pleasing and I don't recommend buying this item. VERY CHEAP
1.0,Turned neck green
1.0,The material is cheaply made and beaks down instantly
1.0,Sizing is off.
1.0,"The product was NOT as advertised.  It was the right length, but half the diameter.  The chain I received has a diameter of  0.75 mm instead of the advertised 1.5 mm.  (I measured it with calipers that can measure down to the 1/1000th of an inch.)"
1.0,Not what I ordered I wanted a belt in the 60-in range this is 71 in which is way too long and not what I wanted and not what I ordered
1.0,This outfit came WORN ALREADY WITH LINT BALLS AND HAIR ALL OVER YUCK!!!!!
1.0,"I loved the print, the color but the sizing chart is not accurate!"
1.0,"I ordered this & went to wear it today, took it out of the packaging, and its full of MOLD !!!! Horrible experience !"
1.0,Pure garbage
1.0,I am a fairly small woman but these MAY have fit me when I was like 10. How are these adult sized?
1.0,"From the moment I put them on I realized these were junk.  My off-the-shelf 2.5 mag, three-pairs for $20 from Dollar General work better.  Could never get these to focus."
1.0,After having this wallet for only a couple of days the zipper busted off. I love mint green but I do not recommend this wallet.
1.0,It fell apart ! CHEAPLY MADE !!
1.0,Two vests have not worked. Would not heat except on the charger. They’ve been returned.
1.0,"This is not a crewneck sweatshirt! It is super thin material. You can see through it! Also, arrived with the tag cut out! Why? Unsure! This was supposed to be a gift…"
1.0,"We got this watch for our child, who thought it looked so cool.  And it does look cool.  Unfortunately, it is junk.  It quit working within 1 year, so we took it to the jeweler to have the battery replaced.  Wasn't the battery, the watch had died & it wasn't worth the cost to fix it.  I would not recommend this watch!"
1.0,"My hands got soggy after a few minutes,make my hands sweat to much, I ordered a different ones same price different company.-"
1.0,Not sticky enough . Did not hold up and began sliding
1.0,Shoe is heavy and hard to keep on. Very disappointing . Probably will not try wolky again.
1.0,"This bag might work for some people but did not work for me.  I returned it immediately.  It had a powerful chemical smell to it, such that not only wouldn't I put my clothes into it but I didn't even want it in my house.  Possibly it might benefit from a long airing out, but the flimsy construction of the plastic-covered cardboard liner that is dropped in (not attached) to the bottom of the bag persuaded me that I should get another bag instead.  Too bad, because the dimensions and design were just what I wanted.  Zippers were beefy, a little bit balky but might become better with use."
1.0,"I wanted a C6, it's a C7. Broke a week later"
1.0,"I purchased this watch a couple of months ago. The battery is already dead. It is bulky, it is more like a watch for men."
1.0,Came with many gems missing. This is not a quality product.
1.0,It’s nothing great about to mention…but the black mask gave me black heads on my nose!!!I was wondering why in an hour suddenly they appeared that too so clear and dark!!then I realized it’s because of the black color of the mask….
1.0,title says it
1.0,Very cheap. The flower was a dull pink and made out of cheap metal that rashed my skin.<br />Very poor and disappointing. Nothing in description about flower being cheap metal. It tarnished after 3 days.<br />I do have an allergy so the exact info did need to be listed. Not happy.
1.0,I thought these were earring pairs....they are not. 7-8 different earrings or ear cuffs or whatever. I was not pleased because I bought these as a gift and they are not suitable for much....unless maybe a guy could use them.
1.0,"Tried hard, in fact.  But the fit on this was just...not good.  It's not that it's not made well, it is.  I just can't imagine who this would work well on."
1.0,The fabric had a musty smell that would not go away with multiple cleanings.  The weave came unraveled during first cleaning.
1.0,Nice watch but the battery was dead
1.0,Way too small. Like a child’s size and was incredibly cheap quality.
1.0,"The product write up on this flannel shirt said it was super soft and the reviews sounded very good, except, I don't think the reviews were for this shirt.  When it came a couple of days ago, I was so disappointed.  It is STIFF AS A BOARD.  Could not believe it after the vendor or whoever wrote it up as being ""Super Soft"".  If is far from that.  I am returning it.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"I loved these glasses! They are huge, but they are the glasses you wear when you don't do your make up or are going to the beach. Sadly, these broke after only about 10 times or less wearing them. I am so bummed, but the frame snapped where the lens is, and you can tell that it is a problem with the glasses. They were sitting on my counter and just snapped. :-( not worth the money!"
1.0,I washed and dried as directed on the label and this shirt shrunk considerably. It is now for small children in my goodwill pile.
1.0,I love the watch the way it is designed and fits well . My problem is you cannot set the date and you cannot set the days of the week on it I tried several times and was not able to
1.0,Total garbage!
1.0,Very thin flimsy plastic. A kitchen garbage bag is is thicker. Not worth it.
1.0,The shoes came rusted and eroded. Appear to be worn and poor quality.
1.0,Runs small. Disappointing. Poor quality.
1.0,"This is a classic you get what you pay for situation. The rose in the center didn't fill the area like in the pic. Glue was also visible. cheaply made and flimsy, I never wore it and I can't imagine anyone would wear what I received."
1.0,"I would order a size up if you want an every day linen pant. The fabric is nothing special, borderline cheap."
1.0,"I bought these in both red and white, and both sets are going back! The size and fit are awkward. I do have a big 5 month old and he usually wears 9-12 months or 12-18 months, with the sleeves and legs cuffed because they are long. I expect his clothes to be long, but compared to how tight the shirt was, these pants were disproportionately long. The hat is also too tight!<br /><br />The fabric isn't as soft as I'd like and I question whether it's 100% cotton, because there was MAJOR pilling after just the first wash. Also, they have a strong chemical odor out of the bag. Because of the smell, I washed the clothes twice each, and separately (because one outfit is red) before putting them on our baby. Anyway, I put the red outfit on him one day and he had a little booboo, so I decided pre-soak the outfit before throwing them in the wash. When I did this, I realized that the dye was still BLEEDING A LOT (even after 2 previous washes). Def not safe for baby...these are going back!!!"
1.0,The chains are too short for a man & woman... It's good for teenagers.
1.0,Totally open wrap not a flared skirt
1.0,too lose and cheap
1.0,"It's a 70s gold color, not the nice bright yellow as in the picture. Also, no fringes as pictured"
1.0,Wasn't soft. Slick nylon with blurred print. Ordered a xxlarge. Still too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,No stars. . . Extremely disappointed.  I did not receive the same dress at all. . . It was navy with lace but sleeveless and quite ugly. . . Not anything like the picture or other reviews or pictures in the reveiws!
1.0,"looks like I'm wearing a sac, had to return"
1.0,The material feels very cheap and the pocket had a hole the required mending.
1.0,I have not bought this one but I just wanted to warn you that you could buy something way cheaper that looks like the exact same it’s a scam it’s not worth the money I bought one for only 12 bucks that was a great quality so don’t bye this it two expensive
1.0,Too much peripheral glare where they don't fit close enough to glasses.
1.0,I would give this no stars if I could. This dress felt like a paper bag. And looked even worse absolutely horrible don’t waste your money .
1.0,The pictures are very misleading showing this hat will fit teenagers and adults.  It might fit a dolls head.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Looks nothing and fits nothing like advertised
1.0,We only got one mitt. Will have to return this and buy another set. This is a Christmas gift so I hope we have time.
1.0,"First. It's too seen through. Second it's different from picture. And I bought shorts for the dress! Now I'll explain. The dress was purchased for swimming. I also liked its color and shape. No idea of how it is in reality. But it cannot be worn for any purpose. Color is definitely not navy blue. The material is very-very thin and seen through. How am I supposed to wear so thin and seen through material under any circumstances? You can see the body and its color. It looks like very chip and very old dress, so old that you don't care to get into water in it. But there are other people at swimming pool. I definitely do not want to be seen in this. One more thing. This material is not going to survive any effort. And I doubt it will survive laundry. By hands or not, it looks like made of very chip and old stuff, I'm guessing, recycled material. I believe that finding old dark clothes to get them on for swimming is not a problem. But I paid for a real dress."
1.0,"This fabric of this skirt is both flimsy and rough to the touch.  The opening at the bottom of the skirt is so narrow, I could barely walk.  The skirt says ""slim fit"" and it is very skinny.  Buy a size up.  I was really disappointed in this skirt."
1.0,Way too small. no return label
1.0,Beware. Smaller than looks.
1.0,"I just got this today, washer in cold, wrong side out on delicate and half the white fuzz came off the stomach. What a waste and we were so looking forward to her wearing this. Such a disappointment."
1.0,Not a good product. This ring started fading within 2weeks
1.0,"broke in 2 days!! cheaply made, not happy at all"
1.0,This just looked cheap.  I sent it back.
1.0,This purse lasted less than a month. Very cheaply made. I'm extremely careful with my purses
1.0,"So, let's start off with the fact that the sleeves are extremely long. Then let's talk about how thin and cheap this material is. Moving on to the terrible sewing and extra thread on every button & seam. The length is perfect, but the terrible top and button layout and collar looks silly on my almost 4 year old. I'm gonna have to work miracles on this one to make this work for Picture Day."
1.0,Really poor quality!! Bought one  and it broke within two hours. Replacement broke within two weeks.
1.0,"This whole ""hoodie"" is so cheaply made. I went two sizes up and it was just wide not long. It fits and looks terribly. The color is way off. The image probably won't last two washes. I regret this purchase and would only get $5 back if I returned it."
1.0,1 star because skirt is pretty but fabric is VERY SHIP  and sheer that's not good . Got and XL and it is A small fit my 15th year old daughter that is 5'6 and weight 125 pound's 😕
1.0,"I ordered a wrong size so tried to cancel the order and placed a new order with right size.<br /> It was not possible to cancel the first order as the products were in transit.<br />I initiated return request, which was approved but i never received the products nor did i get my refund.<br /><br />I did receive my second order with correct size. The pants are of mediocre quality. Fit is weird.<br />As the customer service is terrible, I don't dare return the product.<br /><br />Scam company, terrible service."
1.0,"Received a defective product, the handle has multiple cracks"
1.0,Not worth it. Fit is way off. The material is way too thick.
1.0,Had no shape and was not worth its price at all.
1.0,Not stainless steel. Wore for a week and they peeled. I guess you got many in 1 packages to throw them away every week..
1.0,Buckle is a defective style; the extra loop is unnecessary and obnoxious. Looks very feminine yet it comes up as a male band.<br /><br />Very unsatisfactory!
1.0,After a almost month wait... Highly disappointed..
1.0,The part The is in the front is for the size of a baby’s arm .. rediculous
1.0,The yellow fabric is so thin it's nearly transparent.  Wound up returning due to thin quality.
1.0,Where the opening for volume and power button was partially cover. Leather was stiff and ill fit for cards. Did not close all the way.
1.0,Sizing is way small
1.0,It's just not what it looks like material is lousy!!!
1.0,Not comfortable!!
1.0,This is an extremely misleading product. It says in the description that these are made of heavy grade leather. Total load of BS. The outer edge wrapping seems to be made from some kind of faux leather and the material that make the shape is cardboard.<br /><br />Very misleading.
1.0,The top does not fit like it shows. You will need an undershirt to wear it but even then the material is cheap.
1.0,"Stitching was off..... material was cheap.  But u get what u pay for, 6 bucks!"
1.0,"This toy is nothing but a robbery of $36.89 plus tax, plus return fee.  The parts are fragile, and they don't even fit together.  Does anyone have any duct tape?  You will need the duct tape if you actually plan to play with this toy.  Is this dumpster fire of a toy really sanctioned by Disney?"
1.0,"Do not buy these. I bought them in October for a trip to NY in November. I live in Florida so I didn't use them until then.<br />When I went to use them I realized the inside smelled like dead fish, making my hands smell. Very embarrassing. By then the window had closed to return them.<br />Horrible product"
1.0,Nice looking but recieved with a dead battery. Not happy. So not a good review.
1.0,"I am highly disappointed by this product because no filter can be put inside the mask, so our kids are not protected correctly."
1.0,Too small and badly thin
1.0,This is not cotton .. It's polyester.. It clings and it's not comfortable .. I think they sent the wrong one actually
1.0,Too small for an average size adult. I am giving it to my daughter.
1.0,After reading all these great reviews I bought these leggings immediately. They came to me cropped when It is advertised as full length.
1.0,Very cheep looking quite see through
1.0,"I sized up two sizes and it still ripped when I tried to put it on. I normally wear a size 10/12 and ordered a XXL and its skin tight and the seams are pulling loose just trying it on. And if you are even a little busty, this won't work for you."
1.0,The material gets caught on everything too easily. It looks bad after I wear. The material is nothing like the picture. It's a loosely woven red and white not a solid burgundy as the picture portrays it to be. I was very disappointed when I opened this package.
1.0,Returned it. Poor quality.
1.0,"The flowers were frayed, the band is not adjustable"
1.0,Not worth your time. They don't even look like things...Just some cut steel
1.0,These glasses broke after only very light use. I like the look and lens color but very disappointed in the durability
1.0,This shirt is pretty off center. There is also a weird line from the mid helmet to the bottom. If that wasn’t there it would be pretty awesome.
1.0,"My  10 year granddaughter could wear the 2 XX size. Sizing are off and in children sizes / China measurement. Do not waste your money, not worth the hassle of returning."
1.0,"The pin had most of the flag cut off, of course what was shown in the picture the gray on the top and bottom are almost non existent."
1.0,Aweful the charging cord leaves blisters on feet they can't get wet at all stopped working completely  after exactly one month won't charge no visible damage and no water damage . Horrible product wish I could get my money back plus I had to deal with a very upset 3 year old still and it's been almost 2 weeks !!!!! Very unhappy
1.0,The inside of the lens is reflective and blurs your vision looking out. I have only experienced this once before. I would not recommend these shades.
1.0,The watch was not working once it arrived.
1.0,"You think Oakley, and you think high quality. I wanted frameless glasses, saw several options much cheaper then Oakley, but in the end I thought about quality, and so I decided to invest $200 on these glasses; how wrong was I. Took them to the a lens crafter, as soon as he took them out of the plastic, a pin came off (as you may see in the photo).<br />This is the second time I have a bad experience with Oakley, but I assure you it will be the last, never again will I buy Oakley, nor will I recommend it."
1.0,"Not even real metal of ANY type!! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and it was completely plastic!! Kid's junk... although the turtles are pretty, it's the only plus to this jewelry set!"
1.0,After one week the image wrinkled up it has started peeling off of the band.
1.0,"I suppose expecting a miracle with the 3D technology, I should not be surprised that I would be disappointed in the fit of this t-shirt.  I think the process needs to be worked on... quite a bit.<br /> I ordered loose, longer sleeve and overall length, mid-weight Pima cotton, and lower V neck.  I fit a 22W or 2XL usually, with a few body shape challenges.  My hips are bigger than my (ample 40FF bust), I do have a thicker midsection, big(ish) arms, but I do not have large shoulders.<br /> So, of course, this ""made for me"" was too tight in the hips but almost passable in the midsection, and huge on my shoulders.  The lower V neckline came all the way down past my bra by about 3 inches and the neck was so big I could make the t-shirt off the shoulder without stretching at all.  The pima cotton material was subpar.  I've had softer cotton from Hanes.: nothing to compare to my Lands End or other such manufacturers.<br />On the other hand, the sleeve length hit my elbows perfectly and the overall length was great!<br />Unfortunately the misses are much more than the hits making this an epic fail."
1.0,"I bought a few different ""long"" t-shirts to compare brands. The Duluth shirt shrank so much after the first washing that it barely covered my navel. Before the first wash it was comfortably long. Do not recommend if you're looking for a long shirt."
1.0,I intend to return this watch.  Very pretty but hard to put on and clasp.  Would not recommend it.
1.0,"Horrible.  Might work if you have implants, but for a normal mom chest, terrible.  I am typically a size 4-6 in tops (32dd) and ordered a small - the bottom fit great, but the top was built for maybe a 32J - no support and the sides were way too loose to keep the girls in.  returning."
1.0,I was really excited about these leggings. I got them in black and I wanted t use them for during the day and for wrestling practice in the afternoon for an easy transition. They were so see through. It was like I wasn’t wearing any pants. I wrestle with all boys so it was very uncomfortable to have basically no pants on. Also they ripped in a matter of minutes after a slow jog. I wear an XL. It was too tight. That might be the reason why they were so see through. Certain sections were tighter than others. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,"this gown is a beautiful purple color, but the cups aren't really cups. they're almost flat  triangles. the G-string that came with it wasn't constructed correctly. it has leg straps and one is way bigger than the other. it wasn't constructed correctly.  the bow at the top, is three short strips of fabric.<br />not worth the time and money. I wouldn't order this. i'll probably deconstruct it and redo it with some additional fabric."
1.0,"If you are bigger than a US 10, and have weight around your lower stomach…these pants are not for you. I cannot fit in them. I have never returned anything to Amazon but I’m really trying to think if I would be able to modify these to fit me. Kind of upset after reading the reviews. Not friendly for chubby girls (12-14)."
1.0,My wife says the Metal tarnished after one use and had a weird odor.
1.0,"I bought this in the biggest size because I wanted it to look like the picture. First of all, this sweater was not red like the picture, the picture is more of a deep red, this was bright neon red orange. Also the sizing was way too small. I ordered 2XL so it would be slouchy and it was a small medium, didn’t even fit me. I’m 5’6” 212 pounds. This sweater ain’t it."
1.0,This was a nice idea for a gift for my husband. However the smaller charms fell off within the first week.<br />Then the bigger charm fell off about a week later
1.0,"Very disappointed.<br />I ordered a small and it is extremely over sized.  Granted the description says ""casual loose""  but I found it few sizes too big.<br />I don't understand the ""tie front"" descrition - it would not look right.<br />Not flattering at all.<br />The color pictured was a pretty blue but the description said navy blue.  I was for the picture color but is a navy blue.<br />I would not recommend this- cuter items to be bought."
1.0,"These are huge. Too big to wear. Also, mine arrived damage.The refund is not hassle free like the rest of the stuff on Amazon.It requires packing and printing a receipt so I ended up keeping them"
1.0,"I LOVED this until it stopped working after just one month.  The return date expired just a few days before my beautiful tracker stopped syncing.  A huge waste of more than a 170 dollars. I was furious when I tried to return it and it was 3 days beyond the month allowed for returns. However,  when I called customer service to complain, the customer service rep was able to help me. I was allowed to return it for a full refund. I would not buy the product again but Amazon did the right thing by me so I will remain a loyal customer."
1.0,Wonderful except the stitching around the collar was coming apart before I even put it on the first time.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Took 2 1/2 months to get here. I ordered a 4x. It looks like an xlarge.  It's so small.  I ordered larger size just to make sure it fit.
1.0,"I bought these ""same"" pants from IXIMO in 2019 and LOVE them so much that I wanted another pair. This seller has the same exact picture. Same description. Same color. Same everything..except a $9.00 price difference! But these are NOT the same material AT ALL! The material is paper thin and see through!<br />My advice? Spend the extra $9.<br />Returned immediately!"
1.0,The strap was only attached with one thread. Tried on and broke the strap 🤦🏽‍♀️👎🏽
1.0,Way too small. Came fin China which probably explains it not having an accurate sizing chat. Bought a large and should have ordered XXL to make up for the inaccuracy of the chart.
1.0,"The invicta watch that I purchased was shipped in a invicta box that was meant for a much smaller watch. The box wouldn't close and the watch was just crammed into it. The wrap that comes on a new watch from the factory was just loosely wrapped on the watch and coming off. There was a oily film and ""debis"" in between the bracelet of the watch and full of finger prints UNDER THE PLASTIC FILM! the warranty card and directions were placed on top of the box cause they would not fit into the box with the watch. The watch shipped wrapped in usps bags... No box with padding! I returned the next day. Buyer beware."
1.0,This sweatshirt is tight fitting.  Cute colors - but way too small.....
1.0,I love this shirt but I ordered it two separate times and it had a hole in the armpit area before I even put it on. First time I returned it. Got a replacement and the second time it happened again. Wish it wasn’t like this because this shirt was so cute!
1.0,I ordered this bra in a size 40DDD and it was too small.. after I bought a bra extender I put the bra on and it made my boobs look weird. It was definitely too small! Was disappointed!!
1.0,"Very cheap, not what I was expecting."
1.0,"Too big. Really bad quality, I regret buying it but won't pay for the shipping and handling just to return it."
1.0,"Not worth melting your hair, overheats easily and housed in plastic that melts"
1.0,It was very short and very tight across the shoulders. Fit more like a petite medium rather than a woman large
1.0,"So the pants are well made except for the front pockets.  They use a mesh cloth that in two months of use has already developed a hole in the left pocket.  I carry nothing but the usual things men carry in their pockets: keys, coins, etc.  Nonetheless, these nice looking pants will have to be ""retired"" after two month of occasional wear.  This is a critical fault in the design of the pants which otherwise deserve a much higher rating.  Unless this fault in design is changed you are throwing your money away buying these."
1.0,1 wash and it shrunk so much it's unwearable
1.0,These are not polarized like the picture indicates with a &#34;polarized&#34; sticker.  The sunglasses that arrived were UV blocking but not polarized.
1.0,Arrived with a gash in it that cut almost all the way through!
1.0,Wheel fell off on second use.
1.0,I bought this June 12 and writing thus Aug 12… the band just broke last night - the band itself separated from the clasp in such a way that I cannot repair it… much less that I should have to repair a two month old watch band. :-/<br /><br />It’s garbage - get something else. And frankly it might as well have broken since the elastic was stretched out somehow and I kept hanging to slightly adjust the band length.
1.0,I HAVE ONLY BEEN A WEEK AND ALREADY BROKE ME
1.0,It a bit easier than traditional keys rings but not by much and for what the price point is - well it’s ridiculous - nothing amazing about this product- just a well packaged promo video - don’t waste your money
1.0,I did not like it at all I would not recommend this unless you want a piece of fabric that doesn't keep you warm and have a huge head.
1.0,Save your money. This item is junk
1.0,"CHEAP, CHEAP I took it on a 2 day trip and the chain snapped and then had to carry it under my arm. Never will buy again"
1.0,"This is the second pair of Bunny Eyez that I have purchased. Less than a month and they snapped like toothpicks. At first I thought it was my fault, but after the second pair snapped on the ear arm, I realized that it only takes the least amount of pressure.  While the idea is genius, the glasses are cheaply produced.  I do not recommend."
1.0,First order tool dosent work. Tried to find video. Shows flat tool not round. Replacement item still has round tool. Tied but dosent work. Not worth any more effort. Will return both.
1.0,These shirts are dry clean only.  Who is going to dry clean their work out gear.  Made incredibly small.  Got an extra large and I am 160 lbs. and a D cup.  There were like a belly shirt.  Terrible quality.
1.0,A rip off poor quality
1.0,"band did NOT fit, was coated with some substance which made it brittle...do NOT order this item"
1.0,The fabric was terrible for how much I paid.
1.0,This product did not look like the picture at all. The material was so cheap and thin it felt like a scarf. The tie in the front was not even close to what the picture shows.
1.0,Do not order this. It comes from china and they sizing is way to big!
1.0,We ordered kids masks and got adult one size fits most masks
1.0,"Everything about this was wrong. its made with very cheap fabric. It has no shape. The cardigans that are pictured together with this with lines on it, are made from different fabric and fit much tighter than expected"
1.0,"If you like garbage bag dresses with small neck holes, then you've got a winner."
1.0,"Polyester, not cotton/linen. Yuck!"
1.0,Don't look relatively close to the picture shown. Horrible.
1.0,Very heavy material...not good for people who have small faces
1.0,Did not stick. Did NOT hold anything up worth a damn! Complete waste of money.
1.0,This is terrible quality. It was broken when it arrived. I super glued it back together because my son was so excited about it. But it's crap. Don't waste your money👎
1.0,The back of this dress was a good 3-4 inches shorter in the back than the front...and I dont even have a butt!
1.0,Material is extremely thin. Doesn’t hug the body as it should. Big gap and saggy in the back.
1.0,Love the color and the size but is wearing  badly. Hardly got any use out of is. Very disappointed as I looked for this color for a long time that I could afford.
1.0,Toooo damn smalll
1.0,The gold faded away within 2 weeks.  Bad buy. I guess that's the reason this ring was so cheap! ...
1.0,There’s no distinction between front or back of the pullover. Runs extremely small. I don’t mind the slim fit but if it was about a size up and a tad bit longer it would be perfect.
1.0,Poorly made. Cannot fit.
1.0,Update: tarnished very quickly and for the past week now it's been..well look at the pic. Return now.<br /><br />Love this little ring! Just wish the color chart was a little more accurate for this particular ring.
1.0,Not what I expected !! They only go down to the waist and people sweat like crazy in these  !!
1.0,"Very small, chain is very flimsy unlike the chain pictured. I bought this as a gift and had it wrapped.  You can imagine the look on my face when they opened it. The second picture is the actual charm, not the first. I am happy I bought two gifts so I didn't look like actual complete ass."
1.0,I collect vases and have one that's made of crackled glass. This bracelet reminded me of that and the aqua color that's pictured is gorgeous. This bracelet arrived with three stones so pale in color they didn't look blue. And two of them were in the center so the bracelet didn't look blue. Don't waist your time or money on this bracelet and the seller Admyro!
1.0,I bought it for my husband just wear it for a week and broke.
1.0,Dress is short and cheap looking.
1.0,"**<br />Update 11/3/18: I couldn't take it anymore, something had to change. I shopped around and realized that most other straps do NOT have the shoulders that the included strap has. This was the part that was popping off the protector. I purchased ANOTHER aftermarket strap that doesn't and so far the two have been working great together (see picture).<br /><br />If this review was just for the protector, I would give it four stars, but buying together is a waste, because they are really incompatible.<br /><br />**<br /><br />I bought the protector and strap replacement combo. I love the protector and I love the replacement watch strap, but I HATE the as a pair. I purchased the silver TicWatch Pro, so I liked the idea of having something to protect the chrome and the factory strap seemed to fancy for my day to day. This combo was a perfect fit, or so I thought.<br /><br />The protector fits snug on to the watch in between the body and the strap. Over the course of the day, the band slowly works its way to the bottom side of the protector. When this happens and you take the watch off to lay the watch down (the straps laying flat), the protector then become a projectile.<br /><br />Clearly whoever designed the two items didn't do so with the other in mind. I wish they worked better together because the protector is really a great idea."
1.0,"The product is large, the size does not match the action and does not match the picture"
1.0,Wasn't what I thought
1.0,"Not like the picture at all. Weird ruffles, weird length, and weird chest area. Exchanged for a new size bc I thought my body was the problem.<br />Returned it twice."
1.0,"Didn't know these weren't rechargeable, that's my fault for not reading more, but my complaint is that the wire came out if the heating pad part, and is no longer wearable for what it was intended. Plus the thumb part was completely cut off too, which if u have it opened up as a set of mittens, your thumb still sticks out, looks stupid and still cold."
1.0,They have a very bad magnification to them causing my eyes to hurt really bad.  I do not recommend.
1.0,"The one side of the band comes unhooked from the watch itself at least once a day.  It's fallen off while walking through a store, exercising, and even sitting on the couch.  The other issue I had was that the plastic coating (for lack of a better term) on the band began bubbling up during the short week and a half I wore it.  My original band stayed attached with no issue, but had the bubbling (after a year and a half of use) which is why I chose to replace it in the first place.  Do not order this band. It's not worth the frustration."
1.0,"Too see through and feels ""papery""."
1.0,"So I ordered a large because thats my normal size, however this top is hilariously small, it actually fits my 8 yr old.....the LARGE fits my 45 lb 8 yr old lol.  Luckily she likes the top, but i needed it for me lol. The tag says L and the tag attached says M, not sure what they are doing......or why its like that"
1.0,It’s super cute but when i started to stretch it over my one years olds head it snapped and broke also it came with the jewels off so have a glue gun handy if it doesn’t break on your kids head.
1.0,The stone was nice. The detailing all around it was crooked.. the rope chain was shoddy
1.0,Well I thought they were going to be really good but the problem is every time I take my glasses off it pulls my hair with the glasses so I'm not going to be able to use it I think it would work well for men that doesn't have long hair on their sides
1.0,Poor quality<br />Very bad material<br />Put it in wash and it shrunk and and lost its color
1.0,Very disappointed with the quality. It is so sheer. I purchased this top in 2016 in Neon pink from this company and was very pleased with the thickness of the fabric and quality. I compared this purple one to my pink one and the quality of the fabric cannot compare.This time was sheer disappointment.
1.0,The fabric is rather thin and it has to be hand washed.
1.0,"It was very difficult to set the time, and after I set it up for my wife, it worked for two weeks and then stopped working. For the price, it was easier to take the loss, than trying to have it replaced with another faulty device."
1.0,If you are anything bigger than a size medium just don’t. There is absolutely no stretch to these at all. They are so uncomfortable. The shirt is kind of cropped and I don’t know if I just have big shoulders but it sits weird on me. I ordered a xl. I am usual a true xl. The shorts are just awful. They don’t stretch at all and are oddly long. Just buy a better set. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Chains started falling off . Not well made!
1.0,"You get one very thin strap with hokey plastic ends. I broke a thumbnail trying to get the end to clip, and then when it did it slid right off the end of my daughter's glasses. The glasses have a wider end but not wide enough to make this work. The strap fell off right away. This is one of those times I'm happy for Amazon's free return policy.<br /><br />These might be okay if you have the kind of glasses with a hole in the end, but not others."
1.0,I ordered the black unicorn keychain and received a gold. When it arrived it was all scratched up. Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,"Made very small, couldn’t get my foot in the shoes."
1.0,Got this bracelet and it was way too big for my 13 yr olds wrist. Tried to make the best of it and she wore it anyway. Within 3 hrs the metal clap on the bracelet that holds it together broke completely in half. I would not recommend this product it was very cheaply made and too large for an average teens wrist.
1.0,"If you get interested to buy this watch for real use, look at the photo that shows the strap. Notice there is some sort of metal at the end of the strap. I did not pay proper attention to this detail before buying. I thought this was just a simple leather strap just like my other watches. This detail is different and I spent some time to figure this out. But when I finally figure this out, I really think this is simply one STUPID detail. This made things difficult instead of being simple. It was like the designer of this strap tried to solve something that wasn't a problem. Now this solution became just a problem. You can easily take the watch of your hand. And that when you adjust it to make it easier to put out, now you would have a watch that is simply too loose on your wrist.<br /><br />I just experimented with this purchase, hoping that I would be happy at a seemingly cheaper price against my other choices. Another thing I notice was this watch was making weird noises. I have several automatic watches, like Seiko, but they don't make these noticeable sounds. I was hooked on this product because of artificial sapphire. And I hope the other things should be just OK.  I think the worst in this product was the thing that they make with the strap."
1.0,the top was tied in the front instead of the back; the floral print on the bottom feels too basic to me. i coulda done better.
1.0,The shirt would have been great had it actually said Horror movies and not horror mones
1.0,"I washed this item in cold water on the gentle cycle and it came out of the wash Pink.  I immediately rewashed the item and it came even more Pink.  There was nothing else in the washer for either wash, so it is definitely the shirt.  I want to return the shirt but I threw away the packaging after I tried it on.  What can you do?"
1.0,The color is not the same as the photo showed in the description. It’s definitely a beautiful Christmas RED. Not Burgundy like the photo. And the size was HUGE for an XS I got an XS I weigh 115 and the pants came all the way up past my bellybutton haha. Oh and it is super long I’m 5”5 the pants were dragging on the floor. Super cute just not a good fit for me.
1.0,"Within two days of getting this, the ribbon already fell off. Super cheap product."
1.0,"The quality vs cost appears really good, the packaging was also very impressive. However It's so bulky for a woman's wrist, also very heavy and doesn't match my rosehold Apple Watch. The tools in the box are not easy to use to take out links and there were no instructions so I had to use a YouTube tutorial. Bottom line I am very disappointed and won't be able to use it because it's just too bulky for my wrist. I bought the 38mm (same size as the band that came with my watch), but it is just very masculine in size and style."
1.0,It never worked.
1.0,"Amazon asked me to review these even though I returned them. They were the worst cargo shorts I ever bought, they started falling apart as soon as I tried them on. I've never seen such cheap material in my life, it was like paper. Avoid these."
1.0,after a few months color change. I tried getting a replacement they act like they didn’t know what I was talking about not worth the time or money for this price just go to a Jewelry shop and get what you are paying for
1.0,"The crowns, wands, and jewelry were very poor quality.  Feathers on crown were coming off when I opened the box.  An earring broke the first time we tried to put it on.  Definitely very poor quality and value for money."
1.0,I have reviewed this dress previously and was very disappointed in the sizing. I ordered it three times and found the sizing off each time. Returned all three. Clothing made in China is a problem for me although others seem to have success.
1.0,Too small to be one size fits all!!!!
1.0,I searched so long looking for a hat that would fit my big head only to be sent the wrong size
1.0,mine lasted one days for all of them the redone couldn't shine three feet i just smashed them an kept the batteries
1.0,I bought two of these belts in May 2018 and both buckles have broken in less than 8 months.  the release pin is bad craftsmanship and breaks at the connection point.  Get what you pay for then pay for what you get.
1.0,I didn’t like the dress. It was cheaply made. I feel the dress needs a lining.
1.0,When someone else looks at the sunglasses they see themselves warped in the middle part of the sunglasses. This is a huge design issue and unacceptable. The glass needs to be flat...
1.0,Bought this watch band and love the look of it. I was able to easily size it. Wore it for about an hour and the pin that holds the band onto the connector came out and and my watch face fell on the counter and broke. I am so upset. Cute band but not worth losing your watch over
1.0,"If you are looking for a quality pea coat, go look somewhere else. I ordered this coat and was very disappointed in the quality and weight, not to mention the major flaw in the fabric on the front. So, I returned the coat and asked for a refund. Instead, I received a nasty e mail accusing me of tearing the coat and then washing it to hide the damage! Needless to say I have received no satisfaction to this date, and I am out $65 and the coat.<br /><br />There are plenty of quality coats out there, just not this one."
1.0,Would not recommend.  Fits very loosely & the image is blurry.
1.0,Terrible worst thing I have ever purchased dont waste your money.
1.0,Picture & product not the same.
1.0,Look so so cheap. Awfull..
1.0,"My son loved them, (Christmas present) they just didn’t hold up. Pulling away from sole.  Would love to hear from this company about replacement."
1.0,"Love the look of the shoes and they were very light and easy to walk in, but they were made for someone with very narrow  heels and a larger upper foot area. Had a very odd fit to say the least. So I had to return mine."
1.0,Cheap dont waste your money. All three that I bought broke first wear.
1.0,If I could give these zero stars I would.  I’m a childcare provider.  I bought these for one of my students.  He wore them around 45 minutes and one slipper completely fell apart These are the pieces. As you can see the slipper is brand new
1.0,The clear frame/blue lens combo are just not sunglasses as the lenses are completely transparent. If you need these for a silly costume they’re a good option.
1.0,It should just be labeled small not small-medium
1.0,"Muy pequeño y no cumple con lo que describen,"
1.0,Horrible wrinkled<br />Nylon mess<br />EW not what was in picture at all!
1.0,Broke when I put it on
1.0,Worthless. I threw it away.
1.0,This was not the style as expected what so ever. The material is extremely rough and hard and itchy feeling on your skin and glitter everywhere. It looks white or off white and is very gold
1.0,One side of the velcro ripped off on the 2nd wear. The stitching is poor and veers off the strap.
1.0,Ordered  the  large had to return for the extra large there was really no difference between the two entirely too small
1.0,"Color is not gray, but ashy brown. Cheaply made. Itchy material. I would not work out in these. Not really sure what I could pair it with besides black."
1.0,"Solo dos dias de uso y ya se rompió, no gastes tu dinero en este producto, no sirve"
1.0,Smaller than what I expected and doesn't have good quality
1.0,These are not what I expected.  Maybe good for showing dress gloves for the well dresses man who heading to a wedding.  Very shinny finish and feminine looking.  The gloves I bought before were incredible but they are not available any longer so I bought these :(  -  Deerskin is better I guess...sorry I lost my glove...but I still have one left :)  Try to find them elsewhere.  30.00 down the drain....
1.0,Should cost $5 instead of $20. Someone just slapped this together. No coverage at all either. Maybe will work for someone who has 5% bodyfat
1.0,Only a tone deaf company sells “Blue Lives Matter” pins with Black Lives Matter pins. Absolutely disgusting. Not to mention that the majority of these pins had color bleeding into other colors so they look extremely messy.
1.0,Not satin at all and extremely thin.<br />If you wore these any oils you have in your hair will go straight thru to ur pillowcase so I'd advise to also have a satin pillowcase on your bed if you purchase and keep these.
1.0,It was very poor quality. The charms were constantly falling off.
1.0,"First off, it took over a month to receive. The material is cheap and very thin. Does NOT look like what is displayed on model in the picture. Completely not worth the wait or money. I who recommend skipping on this!"
1.0,Ripped the second day I wore it
1.0,"I bought this glasses thinking it will be great glasses. But as soon as I opened it, I realized it is not what I am looking for. The shape, the material and designs are good. But the multi colors inside the glasses is so distracting. I was looking for same black/gray color both sides of the glasses.<br /><br />So I am returning the product immediately"
1.0,The face broke off the second day ):
1.0,Horrible. Cannot even fit over foot of a child.
1.0,"Runs super small, I ordered a size large n this was not for an adult... also  the zipper from one of the pockets broke"
1.0,"This was far too long, looked cheap, and was just not flattering.  I returned it."
1.0,The cards did not look anything like the picture.
1.0,"First, not sure if this really is 100% linen.  The page says it is, but there is no tag that says it is and it feels completely different than other linen pants and shirts I own.  Either way, they do feel pretty soft, so not a huge deal breaker.  The second thing, and what is a deal breaker is the sizing...WAY OFF.  I went by the size chart and ordered a large.  I normally wear a 38 jeans and 38 or 40 dress pants (depending on the brand).  This thing felt like a small, maybe it will fit someone who wears a 30 or even 32.  According to the size chart, this was supposed to fit up to a 46 waist and 46 hip...not even close.  Will return.  I may buy the XXL and try (overall, the quality and feel seemed okay, not great, but okay), but not sure. I may just buy another similar style from a different brand."
1.0,These don't close well and they look inexpensive. Bend really easy and twist
1.0,This is a piece of junk! The  Picture depicts the same lining as the outside of the best. In truth it's really an ugly one shade/of the light pattern print.
1.0,"I'm giving this one star because I hate this material. I ordered 2 sizes up, so the dress fit, but not @ all like the picture. I also thought it was cotton (my mistake) but it's that cheap nylon-ish type of material that clings to EVERYTHING in a very unflattering way... No bueno"
1.0,Shirt was missing & the tutu was small & seemed cheap. Quality wasn’t good at all.
1.0,Crap. Came all scratched and the outside frame doesnt line up well. Cheaply made.
1.0,Need to return it for refund. The &#34;eye&#34; fell off in one day of wearing
1.0,The back didn't even open so I couldn't wear it
1.0,This is a t-shirt dress.  Definitely not a sweater dress.  it also feels like it runs small.
1.0,Title says enough
1.0,Cute but just not for me
1.0,"It does as advertised. But I should be a little harder take off. I pull this thing off in my sleep every night. I get it as tight as I can without being to uncomfortable and tie a piece of string through it so it won’t come off. Just with the band being tight it broke. The replacement bands are $14.00. For something that was already $160. Edit… had this for a little over a month, and it now no longer zaps you. This was the only thing that could wake me up."
1.0,"The shirt fits very weird. I could not roll up the sleeves. The material was not very breathable and puddled on my chest and back when I sweat outside.  This is a very low-quality shirt I would not recommend anyone buy this product, it does look awesome in the photo but that is pretty much it.  I could've returned this but I didn't want to kill the environment doing so, so I just threw it away.  I'll let a homeless person pick it up and wear it and then let them also throw it away."
1.0,Not good- rusted and discolored- and took long time to recieve- will return
1.0,Didn't work for my larger body type and it was way too small. Had to return :/
1.0,"My son was very happy with his watch when he got it.  He especially liked the different background colors for the light.  But by the third day of normal wear, the face was fogged up.  The condensation got gradually worse until a week later it stopped working all together.  I would not recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Made me hot and sweaty
1.0,"Waist of money!!! Ripped after 2 weeks, very disappointing! Quality is very bad!!!! Will never purchase this again"
1.0,The posts are so flimsy- I'm afraid they will break off completely. Otherwise they are beautiful.
1.0,The balls constantly fall of and don't last long. I wasted my money.
1.0,"Placing a picture inside is a pain. The picture will be damaged in the process. Also, it feels like it will break easily. Don't not buy."
1.0,"Dislcaimer: not a verified purchase because this was a Christmas gift.<br /><br />Overall, a decent watch. But the &#34;water resistant stainless steel&#34; back is rusting after less than a year of wear. Avoid at all costs if you don't like wearing rusty jewelry."
1.0,Size much smaller than listed. Ordered an XL but wouldn't fit someone who wears small.
1.0,Doesnt fit over my nipples
1.0,"When I receive this product, it had eight or so knots in the chain. I don’t even know how the sort of knots that were there could’ve formed just from shipping. I never got to wear it because the chain broke when I was trying to put it on. I’m going to have to get another chain, but the loops attached to the evil eyes are bendy and look easily breakable so hopefully they don’t break off while I’m wearing them."
1.0,We have tried everything to get it to work on pride scooter! You can't get it on to cover the handles and get your hands in it.
1.0,Was broke when arrive very cheaply made
1.0,"About one third did not work at all, and the switch on the working ones is very hard to turn on."
1.0,"The tag shows L, 120, which means only it will fit for girls with height 120cm??"
1.0,"This product was poorly sewn.  It did not last more than a week for me. Total waste of my money. I liked the pictures of it, but sad very disappointed with how thin and cheap it was"
1.0,Bra is not what is represented in ad. Straps are not coreect nor is cup. NOTHING like a Genie bra at ALL!
1.0,"This looks and feels like a piece of those cheap jersey sheets poorly cut into a cardigan.  Take my word for it, keep looking if you are reading this review."
1.0,Way too small.  Better for kids or stick thin women.
1.0,"These bags are smaller than standard plastic grocery bags. You can maybe fit 5 cans of soup in them, although the material is so thin, I imagine they would break. The plastic is thinner than the material for an umbrella.<br /><br />I didn't really expect much for the price yet I was still let down. I figured they would last maybe 6 months, not one trip to the grocery store. Spend a little more and get something that is valuable. I'm trying to cut back on single use plastic and this is certainly no help.<br /><br />AVOID"
1.0,"Took a long time to receive belt.  Came from China.  Belt was not 56&#34; as advertised, but measured out at 44&#34;.  No way  would this item would fit. The cost to send it back to China would cost more than the belt is worth.  Sorry. Amazon, don`t offer this type of junk and expect the customer to be satisfied."
1.0,This ring is not sterling silver. As you see its wearing the silver off. Looks copper or brass underneath. Very dishonest of seller. Would have returned if I would have known. Actually never would have purchased.
1.0,"The item is listed as a zipper hoodie, but there is no zipper. As well as the size information is incorrect. Shipping took way too long and over all I was extremely disappointed."
1.0,"Looks even better than the picture.  This is my favorite purse because it matches everything I wear.  It holds everything I need.  It is a very elegant looking multi colored purse.  I absolutely love it.  However, after giving it a 5 star, I am changing it to a 1 star.  The leather is peeling off and the purse is falling apart.  I am so disappointed.  It wasn't well made at all."
1.0,These colors weren’t like the close-up pictures. They were dull. I sent it back.
1.0,No tiene el color de la foto no me gustó
1.0,I’m 5’10” and it was waaaay too short on me
1.0,When I ordered this item I expected it to be the same as the other ones that I have.. it wasn’t .. it was smaller and all cotton so it was going to shrink .. sent it back
1.0,Had to send back as they arrived broken.
1.0,It said it was supposed to have a zipper on it not  a printed one and it's too small for my child if I would have known it didn't have a real zipper I never would have gotten it.
1.0,Zipper broke in two months. Waste of purchase.
1.0,Lettering peeling off first time wearing!!
1.0,"Holy buckets, this shirt is tiny! I feel like a GIANT!"
1.0,I had great illusions when I bought this. However there was no paperwork whatsoever nor how to use this. I don't even know if there is a button to turn it on and off.  Horrible buy.
1.0,"Okay I'm a bonified M in all clothes, shorts, socks and so on.... but this shirt should have said ""it's a child's medium or it's an Asian size model"", that way I would know to order and XL for an American size model..... lame....."
1.0,there are no crystals!!!!! it is plastick !!!!
1.0,Zipper broke on the first day.
1.0,Hats should be in a appropriate box as the price was great for two.
1.0,"The sole of these sandals is REALLY slippery. It is impossible to walk on hard pavement like tiles, hardwood etc. The sandals itself look nice but it has to have different kind of material for sole. Needless to say its going back. :-( Delivery was very fast."
1.0,"I ordered the XXL size, which in any type of garment usually (and should) fit me with plenty to spare (6'1"", 210).  The hoodie was so small I actually struggled to get it over my head.  Once on it was skin tight around the torso and the bottom hem lined up with my navel.  Are you sure this doesn't belong in the boys' department?"
1.0,Gave my daughter for Christmas. She’s used it just a few times and the pin that holds the strap in broke.
1.0,Cheaply made. Sheer. Unflattering due to poor quality.
1.0,"So I got them in the mail today and one of the prongs was bent so I had to adjust it. You know, that’s just not something you’d expect to do on a brand new pair of earrings. Not to mention they are so much smaller in person."
1.0,I dislike bc I only had it a a week and all the beads fell off
1.0,the towers were sharp and poke into my arm
1.0,I returned the medallion that was sent as an replacement for the first one..it was in even worse shape....not happy..
1.0,Received this bulk order of ear rings and received two ear rings that aren’t same.
1.0,I ordered this sweater based off the size guide provided. It said I needed a 2XL with a chest of 42 inches and waist of 36. Boy was that wrong! This sweater fits like a tent and I returned it. Sad to see there aren’t any smaller sizes available as it is a super cute sweater.
1.0,If you have any belly at all it looks bad.
1.0,I cannot get the wrinkles out
1.0,These were see through and not at all flattering. I returned them.
1.0,This broke relatively quickly
1.0,Cute but very cheaply made. One of the hearts fell off immediately.<br />Had to throw them away!
1.0,Fit and color were completely off. This was such a disappointing purchase.
1.0,broke easily.
1.0,I liked these at first but after a few washes the waist band is big enough to get two of me in them. They are no longer wearable because they fall off. I got rid of them. Waste of money...no pun intended.
1.0,Fabrics scratchy and gross. Fit too small. Cheaply made
1.0,"Item did not look like it appeared on line. Not only did the size run small, it looked pretty aweful/scary on."
1.0,"This extender is so pretty, BUT, IT IS INCREDIBLY SMALL. I ordered a larger size but received THIS. There are no tags on it so who knows what size it is. Have to return it."
1.0,"This is a pretty necklace, but the big pendent fell off and the thing that held it was broke the 2nd time I wore it."
1.0,"The quality was very nice, it does run small and is NOT a dress as advertised. For reference I am 169 pounds and 5 foot 3 inches and it barley if that covers my button. It is more of a sweater than anything. Over all its nice but I am very disappointed in this product, it was not worth the price I paid for it."
1.0,Can only wear these for a few days for they start turning colors
1.0,"Seriously...did i order a knee length dress or a circus tent....I ordered a SMALL, I am 5'3"", and it nearly hit my ankles. Repackaged for return immediately."
1.0,It ripped I had just worn it maybe half hour not good quality for the price I paid
1.0,Like many products of this type it has a fit so loose it's pretty much useless. This one has a metal ban not shown in the photo. The metal prevents it from fitting the ears snugly. Wasted money. I'd send it back if it didn't cost me more money
1.0,"First off, it took OVER A MONTH to ship! I knew this going into it, but my hopes were high it would not take that long. When I finally did get it, it did not fit at all like I thought it would. Way too tight in the chest and the stomach, but loose everywhere else. Top is too low cut (nothing like on the model) and slits on the side are too high. The way it fits the model is completely deceptive. Some parts of the dress hang and other parts of the dress grip. Really disappointed with this dress."
1.0,Just creepy & cheap. Returned right away
1.0,It's very cheaply made and took forever to get here almost gave up hope
1.0,Couldn’t return it-tried to file a claim but couldn’t do that either. Wanted to return for cheap quality and see through.
1.0,Look terrible and cheaply made
1.0,I dislike this dress it did not look fitting on me and it  See through.  The pink dress  It was too big on me I got it a little bit bigger  Cause usually when I order things from Amazon and I get it in my usual size is  Medium  It usually is to small when I order things from online but in this case it was too big.  But I was still not happy with the product.  For clothes I will rather shop at the actual mall. Not online  Because sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not.
1.0,"I ordered one and it was gold in color, not sterling silver.  Requested an exchange and yup, the second one is also gold instead of sterling silver.  Sending it back too.  The chain seemed decent if only it was as described."
1.0,"Not sore why anyone would shrink wrap a sweater, but this 4x sweater came in a shrink wrapped 5”x5” plastic wrap! I had to wash it to get the wrinkles out. But before washing it, it’s 3 X smaller than advertised. The quality feels like see through paper. The colors and the way it was advertised prompted me to order. Since it was stuffed into my mailbox, I wasn’t aware of the delivery. I’ll probably drop at the goodwill. Not happy at all with this sweater!"
1.0,Not what I thought it'll be. Too large & no particular style to it..very ugly to wear
1.0,Very cheap feeling. I returned it
1.0,"Bought to wear under a sheer mesh top.  There is no support at all.  Also the cups fit very oddly.  If you're going for a sexy look, I suggest you look elsewhere.  This was a total waste of money, I didn't return because I kept it too long before I actually wore it and I washed it before wearing it.  Had to order another bra that had some support"
1.0,This is more ment for a xs/s. I am a 32c and it was tiny. I would recommend for someone with a flatter chest. The material is good and it is well made.
1.0,"WHEN YOU TAKE THE INSERT OUT TO PUT THE EARRINGS IN YOU ONLY HAVE A  RUSTY METAL  BOTTOM NO CLOTH TO PROTECT THE BACKING OF YOUR EARRINGS.  PLUS IT LOOKS EXTREMELY CHEAP AND JUNKY TO HAVE A  RUSTY METAL  BOTTOM,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT FOR NICE EARRINGS.  DEFINATELY NOT FOR A GIFT ITEM. WHO WANTS TO PUT NICE EARRINGS IN A BOX WITH A  RUSTY  METAL  BOTTOM  WHERE THE BACKS OF THE EARRINGS ARE GOING TO TOUCH.  YUCK  ALSO IT CAME JUST SHOVED INTO A BOX WITH VITAMIN BOTTLES WAS NOT IN A BAG, BOX OF ITS OWN NOTHING TO PROTECT IT JUST SHOVED IN WITH THE BOTTLES, NOT WHAT I CALL A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY AT ALL, NEVER EVER WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING"
1.0,"The initial turned to a bronze tone 2 days after wearing it. I trashed it after that. Overall, the necklace is a waste of money."
1.0,Color of jean was very dark. Material was poor quality I got a size up and but the shorts were soooo short showing my behind.
1.0,The ends of the sides where it attaches were entirely too long for my newest Apple Watch😑
1.0,"very thin, poor quality, too expensive to sent back to China! can't even give these away!"
1.0,I bought these for a Halloween costume. Now I wasn’t expecting something amazing but I wore these to an event at my neice’s school for 3 hours last week and my ears are STILL raw and red. I do not recommend buying these.
1.0,I got these gloves for my son for Christmas.  He's 5 and smaller than most kids his age.  The gloves are a big hit for his costume and he's having fun with them dispite the fact that when I cut the HUGE tag out of the inside of the glove the seam started to come apart and now has to be sewn. The bigger problem is that the finger slots are SO narrow...that my little 5 year old can barely get his fingers in them AND there's at least an inch that hangs over the end of his finger!! Not really happy with them...
1.0,This kimono looks nothing like the picture and had the material of a pillowcase. Fits horribly!!!
1.0,to dark
1.0,Way too big. Even with trying to fit this correctly to my face it goes into the bottom of my eyes and leaves a huge gap open under my chin. Gonna return these. Cute designs though.
1.0,The ear piece came apart from the material
1.0,It was way too small for the size I ordered.<br />I'm fairly disappointed
1.0,"Not for D, DD, or DDD... Or long torsos!"
1.0,The hat is way too small with no stretch. I dont think this is a hat that could fit an adult.
1.0,"I ordered 3 different versions of these for my mom, sister, and myself. I ordered 1-2 sizes larger for each and they still are a little snug. They aren't cut in a flattering way and from the description, I assumed that it had a zipper, which they did not. Overall, frustrated because it would be way more to send them back."
1.0,"Quality is very very sucks!! Logo is not imprint instead stick by a paper,  Color faded, and dented at side as well. I want a serious refund"
1.0,The metal pieces that holds the band on the watch broke right from the beginning. I was not even able to use it. Waste of money .
1.0,"This picture makes the character face look<br />Bad.  My niece was really unhappy.<br />Attempted return seller no cooperative,  not good experience."
1.0,Watch arrived not working. Emails to the company go unanswered. Looks good but not worth it.
1.0,"Material is cheap, straps are very loose just ugly. Dont waste your money. if you wish to return it YOU have to pay for the return and a &#34;re-stocking&#34; fee 👎🏽"
1.0,Doesnt fit its to wide
1.0,"Horrible, way too big for my daughter and plus when I went to return it, I had to pay an additional $25.00 to ship the return, ridiculous, waiting to hear from the buyer. Just a huge hassle not worth to me."
1.0,"I ordered larger than needed and i think it would fit my grandaughter. I want to return this item, not exchange it."
1.0,The earring wont even fit onto my ear !
1.0,Not long at all.
1.0,Lens doesn’t fit with nose piece. I don’t know how you make a replacement lens without checking the nose piece but this item is useless.
1.0,"This shirt came short, small, and thick! It's not flowy at all. It is definitely not cotton!! Nylon!!!! The v neck is short. It definitely doesn't fit like the picture."
1.0,Very cheaply made and gold layer rubs off very easily.
1.0,They are too big but merchant accepted return promptly. Hope they can make them twice smaller
1.0,Made very cheap. I don't recommend.
1.0,"Junk quality, non wearable!"
1.0,The white top is totally see through.
1.0,I was not very impressed with these. They run size or two small
1.0,These are tiny. and they are just bras they dont cover any stomach at all. very dissappointed and returning.
1.0,"It was short and boxy and in the end, I returned it the same day"
1.0,"I initially really liked these shorts. Good fit, no issues. However here we are not 6 months later and the elastic has gone completely in the leg piece that grips the thigh. I haven’t washed too hot and I haven’t tumble dried. My last pair (different make) I had for 6 years, this is a huge disappointment to have to buy more after not even one season."
1.0,"I have now purchased 2 additional pairs of black ones as the brown is no longer sold, and both have cracked within a week of buying. Totally not worth your money. It’s too bad as they are stylish."
1.0,"This is the thinnest, cheapest material that’s been blurry screen printed on. It’s a flimsy material that, for some reason, doubles over in some areas of the coat that just make it look cheaper and less flattering. Not cute."
1.0,Expensive for quality
1.0,"Well, my son has been using this coat for about two months. It’s not even used daily because it’s been unseasonably warm. The zipper is really impossible. It’s hard to get in, hard to zip, and it catches the fabric. My son end up not shipping his coat at school because he can’t get adult help - - and frankly, he shouldn’t need help zipping his coat. He’s in 4th grade! But it’s really hard to zip. Additionally, equally unacceptable if not more.the thread/stitching is coming out in one of the panels causing one “big” panel in the middle. Awful quality. We bought this exact coat a few years ago and my son lost it on the playground and was heartbroken. I thought I’d make him happy and buy him the exact same coat a size larger to replace the lost one. Very dissatisfied. Do yourself a favor and spend half the money on a higher quality coat. I’m disgusted."
1.0,Sleeves are too short. Cuff at the sleeves look weird. Cheap material. Very unattractive. Last time I buy clothes from Amazon.
1.0,"Returning this item. I ordered according to my bra size, 38DD, from the sizing chart. My breasts were exposed on both sides and also the top, and when I jumped up and down everything jiggled. It does compress, so there's no side-to-side movement, but I didn't like the up and down moment bounce and the exposed breast tissue that was squished to the outside of the bra."
1.0,Doesnt work was a rip off
1.0,Not a good fit for c/d cup boobs. Sent it back
1.0,One of the post broke the first time I tried to wear them.
1.0,Cheap blouse not worth price
1.0,The material is extremely thin.  Would likely wear out after a few months.
1.0,I think every color is a different style ... but this dress is awful. It’s like a slip or something it looks like a box and it’s see through . The pictures shown need to be changed as they are very misleading . They shouldn’t be allowed to post fake pictures
1.0,"Enjoyed these glasses - however only had them a very short time - had time in my truck and the sun hit on them as any other sun glasses I have owed and the sun fried the lenses and crinkled the surface.  If SUNGLASSES cannot hold up to the sun - what is their purpose?  Cannot return since amazon shows it is beyond return date, received them on May 10th 2020.  So much for customer satisfaction - I can't get no ---SATISFACTION."
1.0,"This product is in European sizing so even if you have a closet full of Adidas in your size and know your size, these are sized down. Why not have consistent sizing among your brand ?"
1.0,Not a god sock. Really thin material and they do not stay up so your consistently pulling them up.
1.0,"Ordered an XL and received a medium, don’t even know how you mess that up"
1.0,Muy mala calidad de la tela y pasado de grande de la medida.
1.0,This is clearly very cheap jewelry and it's obvious. The clasp always feels like it's about to break.. not worth returning since I think it came from china and there aren't free returns? Overall not a good purchase it's a very fake looking gold color that doesn't match any of my other gold colored jewelry.
1.0,Dont stick
1.0,Very cheap material. Turned black quickly. Threw it out.
1.0,This dress is very sheer. I would say the material is that of a napkin. And I'm a size medium and ordered an extra large and also did not fit so it's probably three sizes smaller-than-expected. The print was cute but the dress is not wearable I am returning.
1.0,I wore it once to school and right when I got there it broke and fell...
1.0,lost stones on the first day and it is too bright of yellow
1.0,Sleeve of item was damaged and ripped did not notice until I had it on at work it was dirty and sleeves had holes in it.
1.0,This broke within the first few days of wear.
1.0,I would recommend buying it directly from vans. It’s cheaper.
1.0,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers like, and maybe I just got a bad batch, these socks are very cheaply made.  I bought these for my 5 year old, to have long socks to wear with boots.  Washed them as soon as I got them and 2 pair started fraying at the top elastic part (around the calf) and one pair has a hole in the toe area already.  I tried tying the top strings together and will sew the hole but I can't say I recommend these.  They came in packaging that was written only in Chinese, so I'm guessing they were not made in the USA.  NOT a quality product."
1.0,"I liked the price and that's it. Everything g else about these are horrible. When I opened them, one was already beginning to unravel. I used them once and washed them. Now both are unraveling.<br />Absolute trash. Spend a little more money and get a better product."
1.0,"estan muy dificiles para cerrarse,  no las estoy usando por eso.  las voy a devolver"
1.0,"no charge, no lights. Tried several USB cables including the one they sent and no-go. Very disappointed. I'll see if the company makes good on a replacement or I will send back."
1.0,"Not, what I expected"
1.0,I loved the look of it. The lighter wouldn't light without messing with the adjustment screw on the bottom. Needed readjusted with each use. Not wanting to keep a screwdriver with me every time I wanted to use the lighter. The little ball on the hook to put though hole on the belt buckle came off making it unusable. The one I received had a dragon head on each end and was not as pictured. I returned it.
1.0,"These shirts ship from China and take awhile to arrive. I love the look and style of these shirts. They are beautiful! They are also fairly thick so they aren’t see through. They fit just like they should around my waist and shoulders. The reason I bought these shirts was because of the adorable polka dots on the sleeves. My plan was to roll them up and button them. I have reaaaaally tiny wrists and long arms so I wasn’t expecting any complications. But that was impossible. They are way too small (the whites black one is slightly bigger but not by much) If you leave them unbuttoned to reveal the polka dots they flare out really bad. They button up and look/feel fine without revealing the polka dots but that defeated the purpose of why I bought them. I had to return them. Now that’s a ridiculous process. They responded, “return it needs too much time and brings too much inconvenience, in that case, how about we refund you 10 % as compensation? is that ok?” uh no. The shirts cost $41.18. They offered to refund me $4.12. I told them no. They replied, “So sorry to hear that. Are you sure you want to return it back? Because you know, it will take a long time that we receive your parcel again. Which is a big waste of time and effort. In my opinion, how about we refund $8 money to make up your disappointment, and please keep it, ok? What do you think?” Again I said no a FULL refund and that $8 is not reasonable. Yes, I know it takes a while for them to receive the shirts because it took a long time for me to receive them. I do not want to keep these shirts or try to find a person to buy them from me, that requires more wasted time/energy than mailing them back to them. They finally gave me their return information (wow, I needed to mail to California not China and it would arrive in 2 business days) and then offered a final refund of $12 if I changed my mind on returning the shirts.<br />It cost my $9.45 to mail it to California (I’m in NV). They do not pay the shipping cost when you return it."
1.0,"I wouldn't  recommend this to anyone unless they're looking for a nose ring that fits a doll. They were both like miniature versions of what I had intended to order, they would pretty much only fit an infants nose. They would never work for anyone older than 4, it was a waste of money."
1.0,ended up giving it to my 13 y/o granddaughter. waaaayyy smaller than it looks online.
1.0,Very uncomfortable and not made very well
1.0,The strap broke both times i purchased this product
1.0,"This product did not work at all!  I stood up in a wedding that was outdoors, on grass.  I purchased these in an attempt to not have the heels of my shoes sink into the ground and get muddy.  This product worked great for about 5 minutes.  After that, my heels poked through the plastic of the product and sunk right into the ground.  Not only did my heels get muddy (which can be cleaned), the worst part was that the plastic that the product is made up of scratched and ultimately destroyed the heels of my shoes. I wasted my money on the product and had to throw my $100 shoes away because the heels were destroyed."
1.0,I ordered a small and was swimming in this romper. It’s also very very see through and poor material.
1.0,Save your money! These shirts are awful. They distort in shape first time you move fabric to nurse & after laundering them still do not go back into shape. Also the length isn’t any different from large to xlarge. Actually the only difference I noticed from the 2 sizes was the crossover bust pieces in the xl were much bigger but not the fabric on top that covers the uppper torso.<br /> Hate that I spent my $ on these.
1.0,"It’s very cheap made not worth it, very thin and it didn’t fit me. I would be showing my entire behind with this dress. It actually feels more like an undergarment or like a slip that you can wear under a dress. The sticking was poorly handled on the blouse, honestly Not worth it,… I’ll have to post pictures to better describe it."
1.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture provided. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,Toe rings have random sharp parts pointing out and when you walk it continues to stab you
1.0,Not Pokémon copyright.
1.0,These socks are paper thin. My husband likes the thick socks for work and these are not it.
1.0,"When the watch, I quickly realized that the movement was much more bulky than I realized. I  also quickly realized that the time is quite difficult to read when outside during the day as I had to shade the watch so that I could see the lights that tell the time. When I took it out on the water it quickly stopped working even though it had only gotten wet a few times over the course of an hour, so it's definitely not waterproof.  I bought this watch specifically because it said it was waterproof, so that's pretty much a dealbreaker for me."
1.0,Returned because the size listed is not the actual size.  I ordered an XL it was more like a medium.
1.0,After i receive the package whole nightmare start<br />First of all the size its like for a baby not even for toddlers. Second thing is a FABRIC !!! Its synthetic polyester!! And when you want to return the seller giving you hard time by not replying on yours messages and returning your money!!! Its wast of your money !!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Cheap..shrunk when washed
1.0,"See through, you can see straight through these leggings. I tried them on before washing them and you can see my underwear. Useless for the gym. Fine if you wear a long dress. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"I think that it is the fabric blend of the underwear because, despite fitting, they really have a slightly amorphous, shapeless lack of appeal to them.  Because they are mostly cotton, they aren't super fitting, so the ""high waist"" design is kind of lost on these.  A hole also ripped in them on first wear when I looped my thumb into them to pull them down to use the restroom.  I will likely just throw these away and move on."
1.0,"SEE THROUGH. You get what you pay for though with this product, sometimes it’s hit or miss. This is a miss I ordered like 5 styles all came see through and the waist band to me is not ideal. It’s a thin lined waist I like a thicker one. Can’t wear these I’m super curvy so I need a thicker product. Thank you though!"
1.0,Several of the rings broke right away. Disappointing. They are definitely cheap and not really worth it.
1.0,There was no room for my curves. The fit was poor. There was no room for breast or butt!.
1.0,This is made from plastic and very small. Don’t buy this based off the pictures. Do yourself a favor and please buy something else. For $12 you can get a way better keychain.
1.0,"Returned, very flimsy material and I'll fitting."
1.0,"Shoes did not even come close fitting properly -- way too large.  I can't  tell for sure whether or my arches are supported because the shoes fit is so sloppy.  Since this size is so far off from what my shoe size is, i don't even know what size to replace these with.  I knew the internet was a gamble for getting the correct fit.  I should have listened to myself and never placed the order."
1.0,Silver coming off not a good product stay away
1.0,The hoops were not included with the studs as advertised when purchased. Big letdown since that was the main reason for buying.
1.0,It deserves zero stars but that's not an option. I opened the envelope that had clearly come straight from China with all the appropriate international post stamps. This would explain the four week delivery date. I proceeded to put it on and one bead and chain came off. My husband repaired and I made another attemp. This time the clasp came off. You get what you pay for. Don't waste the $9
1.0,"I ordered a bunch of dresses but this one in particular was terrible. The second I opened the bag it REAKED & smelled like sweat/fish. So gross, can totally tell someone wore & returned it… Now I’m stuck with a worn dress because they won’t allow me to return. Terrible"
1.0,Do Not buy this product or from this seller!<br />Product ARRIVE LATE!  BEYOND late!  Seller would NOT respond to my message!<br />Product “finally” arrived being 5X smaller than expected!  NOT ok!  Product looks cheap.<br />Sincerely disappointed :(.
1.0,Didn’t last 2 months. Not very comfortable to wear at the bottom side of the wrist. Color is slowly coming off where the claps latches. Band broke at the piece that attached to the watch and was stuck in the watch face.
1.0,These were so tiny I could not even get them on. I admit that I am not tiny but other pants the same size fit well. I expected more stretch. These have no give
1.0,"Within a month, both earrings no longer had the black stone in them."
1.0,No pockets. Short sleeves. Smh. What a waste.
1.0,No sleeves! Just wide open underneath and will have to wear a tank or tube top under it.  Not a good buy if your big in the breast area because the fold over portion wants to roll up! 🙄
1.0,"If you have hips that are wider than you legs or waist or both - prepare for them to look about the width of a transatlantic barge in this sweater. I have found few sweaters less flattering than this one... and I'm pregnant, so that's saying something."
1.0,I don't liket...sorry
1.0,Horrible stitching and fits to small!!!!
1.0,"My product was received today,and was defected . The gold paint is chipped and the ball has a sharp edge that jabs into my stomach. :( was disappointed."
1.0,"These did not fit, however<br /><br />WSSROGY 20 Pack 25mm x 50mm Large Rectangle Pendant Trays Pendant Blanks Cameo Bezel Settings for Photo Charm, Cabochon and DIY Jewelry Making(Antique Bronze) did."
1.0,Broke immediately.  Horrible cheap plastic.
1.0,This dress is supposed to fit loose but omg I'm 5'8 140lbs. This dress swallowed me. I bought a small needed an xs
1.0,SUPER cheap quality. The off the shoulder top part of the shirt is HUGE. Larger then the bottom part of the shirt.  Awful.
1.0,Improper fit and poor quality fabric
1.0,"Although these were a novel idea for a party gift, in the order of 40 pieces only 15 worked. We returned them for frustrations sake."
1.0,"There are tiny pockets that are placed too high, so your arms would need to be completely bent, you can't rest your hands in the pockets and only half of your hand is going in anyway. The buttons are not lined up with the holes at all. There are four button holes and five buttons. The price is way too high for this item. It's shorter than expected It's above the knee I'm 5'3"" and the fabric is thin not great quality. Sad I waited so long for THIS to come."
1.0,My dislike is that there much thinner than what they look like
1.0,Does not fit my wrist..too big. I thought it was adjustable and would fit. Its a waste now
1.0,I bought these but couldn't wear them. The edges were very sharp and was cutting into my ear.
1.0,"Super super super thin, unwearable"
1.0,Save your money.  It’s not worth it!
1.0,This light dimmed after one use and is pretty much non-functioning now. Save your money and buy elsewhere.
1.0,The watch is so beautiful but it doesn't work!  The second hand moves very slowly if at all.  I've worn it all day and had it set at the correct time to start the day and the watch is an hour behind within 8 hours.It doesn't keep time. I'm so disappointed.
1.0,Top was tiny. I ordered a small and medium and both were way too small. I am a 34DD.
1.0,"This arrived broken. It is very cheap, so not order. Was going to send it back but not worth my time and gas. Threw it in the trash!"
1.0,"Very poor quality this was going g to be a gift but it took forever to arrive. This has a 3rd party vendor and I'm waiting for instructions to return the item. Inexpensive yes, but it looks it."
1.0,Sizing is small. Disappointed!!
1.0,"I'm very disappointed with this company and their service. I purchased the year of boxes for $350. And I only received 3 out of 4 of the boxes. I contacted customer support and they told me they sent me the 4th Box alredy which is not true they also told me that they sent it before the purchase state of my 1st Box which is ludicrous.<br /><br />The cancelation was super weird as well as it had me register for my for what I thought was my 4th Box but then said I had to cancel the day before the Box was due. So it felt shady and in fact it was shady because I never received my 4th Box.<br /><br />With that said the 1st 3 boxes were cool but I had problems with products in each of the boxes.<br /><br />In my Winter Box the purse broke after 2 uses and the earrings broke after traveling with them once.<br /><br />In my summer Box the beach bag they sent broke after one use. Over all the quality of items was very poor and cheaply made over half the items would break after light use.<br /><br />Additionally all the clothing they sent looked cute but was so large it could fit a horse. I'm all for Bohemian style but none of the outfits looked size appropriate for anyone. The green summer cover is massive, the white beach throw could fit 3 of me.<br /><br />Very poor and pricy, would not recommend, I've moved onto Fabfitfun and so far so good."
1.0,The clasp was broken when I received it. I ordered another one and the clasp was also broken.
1.0,"Size is way off... I ordered a black and a brown one in size 7-11 (the largest size) & the belt wouldn't close, won't even reach the buckle. I don't know what kind of shoes they expected those to fit but definitely not riding boots, maybe mocs.<br /><br />I have to admit tho, the leather is really good. Too bad I just wasted a few bucks on this."
1.0,The replacement band arrived but did not contain the pins necessary for attaching it to the watch a very inexpensive item considering the watch band was over $23
1.0,"I bought this a while ago and just had time to try it on, it looks ridiculous on me I felt like I looked very frumpy in this item. If it weren’t too late I would return it but unfortunately my return window has closed. I would not suggest this item"
1.0,It’s not the authentic brand from Nike  !
1.0,Already broke! Not happy. Don’t buy. Literally had it for one week. I want a new one for free!
1.0,Very strange.  The drawstring was white and thick.  Didn't look nice at all
1.0,"Way too small, a few inches too small despite ordering bigger as suggested"
1.0,Has fallen off everytime I wore it..will not wear in public
1.0,Thought it would have been a s lovely as the picture.... it's not as bright as the image.... everything about it is Very dull....
1.0,"This gets one star, because it fits beautifully and looks LOVELY for FIVE MINUTES. Then it starts to pill. It doesn’t even have to rub against anything. Just wearing it, the top began to pill. After two hours, it looked two years old. After half a day, it looked 10 years old. I can only imagine what it will look like after washing!  I would be embarrassed to wear this anywhere now!"
1.0,"The belt while seemingly well made, had an extremely strong and unpleasant odor to it which forced me to return it. I delayed the return for several days, but the odor remained. Hopefully this was a fluke."
1.0,Cheap quality and had a large cut on it when received.
1.0,Didn't work as expected...
1.0,"I am obsessed with all the milkbarn designs, they are super fun and cute. The fabrics are also incredibly soft and wonderful. The sizing is why I am giving this particular one only 1 star. I bought my 7 month old son the size 12-18 months and we own a couple of other designs of this zipper pajama, so I know that this size normally fits him well. But this one shrunk so much, we can’t even get it up his chunky legs. In other brands I usually buy him 9-12 months size as he is a bit of a big boy and I thought I was exaggerating getting him 12-18 months at first but that’s his size in milkbarn products, everything shrunk so much that it fits him perfectly now. Except for this one, which is sad because they are pricey and I won’t even get one wear out of it!"
1.0,"Cute design, but clicker falls out easily."
1.0,paint is peeling off while still in the package.  Cheaply made.  Would not recommend this product
1.0,I would do less stars if possible.
1.0,I’m having trouble keeping the band tight.
1.0,"Material is good, but fitting is not what I expected. Also, the neck area is too wide"
1.0,I wear a large and ordered the extra large to give a little breathing room and I can barely get the pants and shirt over my legs and arms respectively. I am not sure if this is supposed to be a Childress size but there is no way I can wear this.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9b8ebde4ce89e7f5a3f16f204d913dcc]] Pésimo
1.0,Tiny and cheaply made.
1.0,These will only fit glasses with large temple pieces. Since they did not fit my glasses I returned them. Company really should tell people they only work for certain size glasses. Can’t say if they would work or not.
1.0,"I am 5’10” and about 155, I typically wear an 8 or a medium in tops. This shirt says “one size” and implies that it is “one size fits all,” but it actually just means that they only offer it in a single size, and that size is a small. It’s intentionally misleading and very annoying. The shirt has plenty of room around my waist but fits my bust like a sports bra. Also, at this price range I’m not asking for the moon in regards to quality, but the shirt lined in the same thin, patterned fabric so you can easily see the pattern from the lining and it looks weird."
1.0,Everything  was entirely  to big.Wish it would've  mentioned  that.
1.0,"I didn’t expect much, considering the low price, but at least 4 pairs arrived broken. They were also very small, might fit 4-8 year olds. I definitely returned them."
1.0,"It was a beautiful ring , it tarnished after 3-4 days of wearing it , it was so pretty , wish it wouldve lasted a little longer"
1.0,Sequins were all over the floor.. Too tight in the arm area and  poorly stitched...
1.0,"The intention was to wear to a funeral but quality of fabric was extremely poor : fabric  much too thin, would be perfect for a doily or table cloth."
1.0,I bought this for the nose piercing and it doesn’t stay in your nose at alll
1.0,This looked awesome!  But on the one night he needed it Halloween the jacket busted inside and it wasn’t to small.  The arm literally ripped off.
1.0,It is not even close to &#34;one size fit all.&#34;  It might fit a child. I was disappointed by the size and the color appears to be darker pink than it seemed in the photo.
1.0,The locking mechanism on the watch broke the second day when I was about to put it on. I will be returning it.
1.0,Received this shirt in a 3X and it was more like an XL. The sleeves were very very short. Returning it.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7a04251e5e38a5ac4bbffd123ed1a194]] The band does not stay tight on ur wrist so don’t excercise with it bc if u do it gets lose and can fall off also it pinch’s ur wrist so make sure u shave ur arms !
1.0,Child size..but adult
1.0,Smaller than expected... Said one size fits all... I was able to cut the arm hoes bigger to make it a little better but this is for a small framed person.
1.0,great stuff packed bad box came wet
1.0,"This a cheap shiny dress .  I read the reviews, wanted to see if it was usable.  Nope gifting for bag day or giving as a cheesy birthday gift."
1.0,Missing chin strap; one of the reasons I purchased item. Unable to &#34;unwrinkle&#34; the brim and it doesn't lay correctly. I covers up my face and is too large. The brim is  larger than I expected and as pictured. I will be returning this.
1.0,Quite disappointed in the size and look of this watch. Not impressed at all.
1.0,These socks do not stay on for anything
1.0,Would do better as a pair of teenage girl spanks.
1.0,Cute. Until washed. I hung to damp dry and fluffed in dryer. Nope. Shrunk in all directions.
1.0,1st of all the second mask the face on it is HUGE and just looks horrible. The first o e is nice but no matter how loose i make it the elastic cord wears a groove in my nose and hurts after a few hrs .<br />Plus the return info they gave me didnt work
1.0,Terrbile quality. I meant to return this item but now I'm stuck with it... going to GoodWill I guess. Waste of money!
1.0,The fit is really small and tears easily. Not good quality material
1.0,"They were long enough for my daughter but there was so much extra room around the feet and ankle, there is no way she could wear these with ballet shoes. It was even too large for my foot. I purchased another set that had the heel and foot shaping that worked so much better."
1.0,"The design is cute and well executed. But the owl is very small, much smaller than other charms. Also, the design is only on one side..."
1.0,Product too loose & very thin.  Would not buy again
1.0,"Shorts didn't come with belt , and button was missing.  I bought them for the belt as well"
1.0,"This jacket was awful. The picture describes it beautiful but when it came, it was thin plastic.  It looked like it was a one time wear jacket and then dispose of it.  The sewing inside was half way done with lots of fraying. I sent the jacket back.  Don’t waste your money, very poor quality."
1.0,Fit well never used had to returned
1.0,"If you are looking for good quality, not recommended."
1.0,This is a really ugly shirt.  It is going back as soon as I get a chance to send it.  The top part fits nicely but on the bottom of the shirt right over your belly region it has rouching in such a weird area that it makes look like you have a big belly.  The extra material is not flattering and it seems to serve no purpose other than to make a pouch right over an area that most people don't need extra weight.  I don't like this shirt at all.  And too bad too because if they hadn't made the stupid pouch at the bottom of the shirt this would have been a beautiful shirt.
1.0,Didn't fit at all.
1.0,Fell apart the first time worn.
1.0,Thong part ripped out after only wearing a few days plus the black rubbed off onto feet
1.0,I ordered an XL and could barely get it on.  everything about it was awful and I am super disappointed!!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!<br /><br />I decided to splurge and finally buy a &#34;nice&#34; pair of sunglasses after constantly using cheap 10 dollar Rayban style glasses.<br /><br />First time wearing them they felt great!  The second time I put them on, my girlfriend pointed out to me that they were crooked.  After this, they just got worse and worse.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and we began a dialogue where they asked for photos.  By the time I uploaded pictures they requested, they told me the return period had ended.<br /><br />I am now back to using my $10 glasses with $80 down the drain."
1.0,Looks plastic and cheesy
1.0,The stone fell out the second day couldn't  find it. It tarnished really bad in two days poor .
1.0,"I did not like the fact the dress appeared to have been worn! No tags,  very disappointed! Really ruined my day receiving this used dress!! Does not fit!!"
1.0,"Had to remove several links because of my dainty wrists.  I tried for hours with all the tools a multimillionaire, platinum album rapper could afford but no luck. Do not buy."
1.0,"Buyer beware. If I could have given this ZERO stars, I would have.<br />Dispite the decent reviews, this isn't worth the money. Even at such a low price. The fit was a little larger than expected, which isn't terrible. However, the collar did not lie flat like the sample photo. And after one wash, (cold, tumble dry) the shirt shrank so much and in such a strange way, there's no way I'll be wearing it a second time."
1.0,Seriously Toxic
1.0,They look ok but the mounting is glued and I've had to go to my local jewler twice so far to have one of the stones glued back into the mount.
1.0,I wear it all the time. I wish they would come out with the Scat Pack bee with wheels.
1.0,Nice looking and watch. Broken on arrival.<br /><br />I handled the watch for about 5 minutes before attempting to set the time/date. Crown fully came off and cannot be reseated.
1.0,So cute and came in much earlier than expected but not very durable. Already broken and it has been worn for less than a week. Very disappointed it was a waste of money considering it didn't last very long and the seller doesn't seam to respond to any feedback or handle any issues.
1.0,Haven't been able to wear this yet because the chain broke when I was unhooking the clasp.
1.0,"Not only is the outfit sized too small, the material is of a very poor quality. I ordered a 2x as a result of the reviews saying that it ran small. I purchased this as a gift for my adult daughter and the first time she wore it the fabric was pilling on the legs. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Very difficult to adjust. Two lenses on right and two lenses on the left. They move left or right independently when you turn the ""dials"" on each side of the glasses. I would not recommend these glasses."
1.0,smallest nose ring I've ever seen.
1.0,If this is for an adult only the hat and bow tie is suitable. The tutu is a piss poor product and super small. But is good only for a lil child. Plus it’s super thin.
1.0,These are not polarized
1.0,Dudua 20pcs aluminum Heat Sink????<br />Mailed?????
1.0,this was actually terrible im not exactly a tall person (5'1) and this things arm straps were like 3 feet long the slack was laughable and there was no way to adjust the straps.  i could not wear it so i had to return it.
1.0,They need to be made of anodized stainless steel in gold tone so they won't tarnish in just  few days.
1.0,Lens fogs up at first breath.  There is no way to seal against your nose.
1.0,In one & 1/2 days the stud fell out 3 different times. The first 2 times I was lucky enough to find the stud. The 3rd time was not a charm.
1.0,"I liked this because it looked like Luna Moth wings, and I was going to build a costume around it. The item is significantly more blue and purple than pictured, and the shape of the wings is different. The bottom of the ones that came did not have the two little tails, it was just a rounded blob."
1.0,"Too small, and the clip fell out right away I have to hot glue it!! What’s the point?"
1.0,Product was shipped and then returned for damage. What a disappointment for a Christmas gift.
1.0,Run big.  The straps are way too big.  I had to poke holes in them to wear them and they still are big.  I definitely wouldn't recommend these at all
1.0,Broke right when my daughter opened to put it on. very disappointed.
1.0,Bought two pants. One had a broken zipper and the other had a torn pocket.
1.0,"I read all the reviews and went Head and ordered a larger size, 2 sizes bigger to be exact, and this junk is still too short. Whoever is making these outfits must have the shortest legs on the planet. My daughter is not overly short or tall and she looks like she is waiting for a flood in this outfit. So sad about it since I needed it for pictures this week and now have nothing for her to wear!! Dont order this unless your child has stubs for legs, you will end up with a shirt that drowns them and calf high length pants to go with the tent of a shirt!!!!"
1.0,"The neckline and strap was all messed up…definitely an error in factory, would not tie up correctly l I believe it was put on backwards."
1.0,"These shorts ripped down the entire front leg after wearing them for 6 hours, may have got a bad pair, but I cannot recommend."
1.0,This broke 1 day after I got it. Very disappointed!!!! It arrived quickly and packaged nice but none of that matters bc it broke right at the cross connection with the chain. VERY upset..
1.0,They bent out of shape easily and were difficult to put on and a waste of money.
1.0,THIS HAT IS NOT WOOL
1.0,Blaze orange. Looks like Halloween.
1.0,Analog part stopped working after 3 weeks.
1.0,1st it took 3 weeks to get here.  I was shocked when I opened it.  $29.00 is price gouging.  It's just a piece of material.  I will not buy again.<br />Do not buy!!!
1.0,Won't stay clipped to the Govo ID holder/ wallet.  Falls off when sitting down or when getting up from sitting. Returned.
1.0,I liked the material but it was super short. Anyone over like 5’7 it looks like your waiting for the flood.
1.0,Size 2x fit my friend that was a size 4!!
1.0,Material to small
1.0,I bought this for a dear friend for her birthday. She wore it for three hours and it broke. She loved it so much she wants me to order another. I will give this bracelet one more chance. I am beyond embarrassed.
1.0,"The bar is so thin, I cannot get them on."
1.0,Product no way similar or quality of past Greg Norman shorts. Won’t buy these again.
1.0,Doesn’t fit around my neck or wrist. Waste of money don’t buy this
1.0,Absolutely shapeless. Sorry it didn't work.
1.0,Not worth it it runs small and cheaply made. Within second time wearing one the wire popped out and snapped
1.0,"If I had a very small monkey or maybe a chipmunk these would probably fit. But for the average size adult, it is completely inconceivable that they should be used for reading anything. So in essence, save your money and don’t purchase these."
1.0,They broke easily. Very disappointed.
1.0,I hate these shoes. They are a pain to put on & it makes my feet feel gigantic.
1.0,Wasn't as long as the pics made it look. I ordered a size up for the length
1.0,very bad quality and the picture is kinda misleading. U can get a better one with the same $
1.0,"Based off of the size chart, I ordered a size ten. The dress came and looked a little cheaper than it looks in the photos, but was not my biggest concern. It did not have a number size (10) and said ""XL"" on the tag. Okay, I would have bought a large anyway so I thought it might be a little loose. Well, this ""XL"" is a joke, it fits like a small! My arm literally would not fit in the sleeve. So frustrated and irritated I'm not even wasting my time to send it back. So if you're a size 4, order the 10 aka XL."
1.0,This band was really pretty but it broke within 30 days. It fit my wrist comfortably and was so convenient but I am dissatisfied with the quality.
1.0,The quality is very poor. She slippers are shedding a lot and we find fur all over the house. The stitching inside is poorly made and my child expressed that it hurts her toes and heel. She refuses to wear them because it's uncomfortable. The design is very cute but the quality is terrible. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,Don't waste your money.<br /><br />This shirt is shorter and thinner than expected. After just one wash it became see-through in patches (as shown in picture).<br /><br />Terrible quality. NOT recommended!
1.0,Quality was not what I expected on these. I guess for the price I over anticipated. They faded on the second wear. I at least expected to wear them a few times before they turned my fingers black. Very disappointed! They look pretty but you get what you pay for. Not happy!
1.0,Please do not buy from this company. The shirt is hideous. I will throw this away. It is not even close to the picture. It is much shorter and a poor copy of this shirt. It is made cheaply and the color is not even in the same family. It is a gaudy bright pinkish orange. The necklace I didn't care about anyways but it is too gross to even give to the little girls next door. A total rip off.
1.0,Mal producto es decepcionante  muy mal material y pides tu sais y queda muy pequeño aparte que levantas las manos y se sube 🤨
1.0,"Terrible product... Too flimsy, doesn't hold shape, flare is too outward as well"
1.0,Product was too big. It looks cheaply made. The tummy babe definitely don’t work.
1.0,Arrived broken and looked cheap. Almost kind of a plastic look.
1.0,The cups even without the inserts are too small
1.0,Just received mine. THey are black not blue. The color says blue but these are not even a dark navy blue they are definitely black  :(
1.0,"To tight around my head, gives me a headache."
1.0,"Too heavy, doesn't stay on your ear like the photo shows."
1.0,Practically see thru- bad fabric<br />Wish I wouldn’t have gotten it bc I threw it away
1.0,This Ferrari Beanie had a hole in it. Very disappointed. this was a gift. I was very embarrassed.
1.0,the material is cheap.. doesn't look like picture and i immediately returned it
1.0,"Cheep, and not what the picture shows."
1.0,"I am disappointed with this dress. I ordered a small and the top portion of this dress is very long, I am 5'6"" and feel like he dress would fit some one 5'8"" or taller. Also there is way to much material in chest, I am a C cup and don't even come close to filling it out so the material puckers under my boobs and looks horrible. The color of the dress is very pretty and the material feels nice. I am sad the fit is wrong"
1.0,Very cheap material and way too short in waist
1.0,umbrella is hard to open/ I am not recommend to anyone. Its a big waste of money
1.0,It arrived broken - very low quality and cheap looking
1.0,HUGE!!!  Looks like the shoulder pads of the 70s!
1.0,DONT BUY IT
1.0,"Unfortunately I donated this as soon as I received it.<br /><br />I was really hoping to add something casual to my work attire- but this was so wrong. The material was not flattering, the color did not look like the picture, and the material was rough and gaudy."
1.0,Yikes!  My son loved these jammers until I went to his swim practice and could see his whole backside.  Whoa!  Thankfully the front has a liner but the back does not.  They look great until they get wet and you can see *everything* on the back.  Do not buy!!!
1.0,It’s not your standard cup size poorly made itch material
1.0,Glasses came with no no lens. Cannot use
1.0,Not happy I ordered this pair with others and next out this one got all the rest I want a refund or another pair sent but the ones I did get I love super comfortable and stretchy but stay up don't have to keep fixing them
1.0,The product comes with no chain.
1.0,We should of read the other reviews. These hats did stick together and could not get them apart. had to send them back.
1.0,Cheapest thing I ever bought off amazon.
1.0,I thought it was going to be thiner and more sleek. More look for a more dress look
1.0,"My vest barely fits while stationary, but it pulls apart while I run. I'm not a large guy (6'4&#34; @ 210lbs.),<br /><br />My headlamp doesn't work even with new batteries, and only one of my red lights work part of the time.<br /><br />Wrist Straps (Slap Bracelets) are great and neon bag operates well."
1.0,This arrived ripped.
1.0,Way to small for my 6yr.old grandson
1.0,The champagne colour is not as pictured. Very disappointed.
1.0,Wouldn’t recommend I had to replace in a week because the clip broke
1.0,Bust had no support
1.0,This blouse is not as advertised.... the color is totally different and the fabric looks cheap...
1.0,"At first glance I thought I was shipped the wrong item. This is not a swimsuit at all. It is a pair of barely there “bottoms” that are thinner than tissue paper. And the “top” is just a long strip of material that you are supposed to bandage around to make a top. No support, padding or shape of any kind. Might possibly be my worst purchase from Amazon ever. Thank goodness for the option to return."
1.0,Horrible . It took weeks to get here. Horrible quality. The size of a child. Material cheap.
1.0,"Does not fit ""one for all"". Very uncomfortable. Cannot stand to wear them!"
1.0,The boots arrived dusty and looked like they had been worn. Even if they had arrived in good condition I never could have gotten my foot in them. They look much cuter in the picture. In reality they look cheap.
1.0,The buckle kept falling off.
1.0,Cannot set the time. I can set only the hour.
1.0,Zipper was DOA. Broken in 2 spots. Managed to get one use out of this for my daughter. Fabric was fine. Makes less than a great value.
1.0,Should have known it was too good to be true!! My grandson ordered this and didn’t read the reviews and what we received was a sweatshirt that could be sold at a dollar store!!
1.0,Cool looking hat but it instantly started to become discolored from an average amount of sweat. I've tried washing it and using products like oxy-clean to no avail.
1.0,"This product isn't in American sizes.  These ladies shirts would fit my grand daughter and I bought it for my daughter. Very thin, not a sweatshirt and it smells like urine"
1.0,I ordered a rose gold color but it did not match.  It looked like it was gold.
1.0,Made in China. No real tags on it. Shirt is super thin - needs an undershirt. It’s a crappy made t shirt that they added lace too on the arms. I expected a nicer quality shirt from the pictures - extremely disappointed!
1.0,I never recieved the item the product looks nice though.
1.0,"Waay too small, the ring or diameter size. Then what I expected."
1.0,Horrible Quality and returning the item would have cost me more than the actual shirt!! This company seems like a scam!
1.0,"Good size, pretty, but unfortunately came broken in the bag. The loop where the hook connects to was broken and the elephant was loose at the bottom of the plastic bag."
1.0,The magnification was cockeye on glasses. Waste of $. Do not buy!
1.0,Cant remove links to fit the watch. Trash
1.0,"Only good if you have skinny calves. Couldn't get past my ankles and I have 17 inch calves. I liked the design. This is what separates the low cost compression socks from the high end ones- sizing for length, foot size and calf size...not just S, M&#60; L&#60; XL."
1.0,It's like a wrap not an outfit.
1.0,Feel apart after one wash.
1.0,looks like a girls hat and looks like crap..poorly made china crap !
1.0,Broke after one day
1.0,The quality of these shoes is very poor and they only have 6 months of use. The photo speaks for itself. Not to mention the bad smell.<br /><br />I can not understand how Amazon has them on their sales list.
1.0,Didn’t like the length it was and awkward length. Also not a fan of the material.
1.0,If I could give this less than one star I would. Mine came busted and sharp and won't go in my lip without making it bleed. Having a hard time getting this replaced. Less than impressed.
1.0,"CHEAP MATERIAL, TORN OUT THE PACKAGING.."
1.0,Thinner poor quality
1.0,"looked great, stones fell out in just a couple days."
1.0,Not the material I was hoping.The earrings were more like floor linoleum. I was hoping for more of a wood material.
1.0,This product did not have Transition nor Polarized features as advertised
1.0,The product was not straight
1.0,Fit very tight!
1.0,I ordered x-small and x- large came. Was so excited when I saw x-small ok tye package to my surprise it’s an x-Large pants... 😏😏😏😏😔
1.0,The absolute worst product I have ever purchased. Came over a month late and are the worst quality I have ever seen.
1.0,Runs extremely small.<br />I’m 5’8 174 and the XXL was still too tight.
1.0,Threads hanging from pocket belt inside seam!  Bad workmanship. Robert in this condition should never been sold. Don’t want it. Expect to Receive full credit including shipping.
1.0,"I really wanted this band to work, but unfortunately one side of the band I received would not slide into the receiver on the Apple Watch. I tried on the Ultra and the Series 5. Maybe I got a defective band, but I didn’t want to try again with this brand."
1.0,This was a gift. It’s very poor quality and unable to return
1.0,CHEAP. Plain & simple! Fell apart in less than a week!
1.0,Way too big not the right size
1.0,Not sterling silver! Not what was stated in product description! I only buy sterling silver or gold &#34;solid&#34; and never plated. Don't buyDon't buyDon't buyDon't buy
1.0,Item was very light weight and cheap feeling. Not at all what I was hoping for.
1.0,"I couldn’t even fully try this on. If ANY of your height is in your torso, don’t bother. The cups were at my rib cage and I couldn’t pull it all the way up. I am 5’10 and ordered an XL. Such a bummer"
1.0,I don't like it. The picture is beautiful but in person it looks like a 3 year old made it. It was a waste of money for me. Maybe you may like it but I don't
1.0,"Very cheap, you can see your hand through the material"
1.0,Looks old and The plastic burnt
1.0,"Despite measuring my waist and chest to use the size chart, the robe size i selected was S/M and it didn't even go down to my knees. It was way too wide on the shoulders are the arms were too short. I looked like a 5 year old wearing their fathers sports coat."
1.0,I ordered an XL and it was extremely Small fitted like a Medium size my 13 year old could barely fit in it.
1.0,These gloves fit me well and worked fine until the stitching came apart after 2 weeks. I need gloves that will last and these aren't it.
1.0,"I ordered a size up based on reviews, but as soon as I saw the shoe box, I knew these were going to be way too small. They are at least 2 full sizes too small. Even if they had been the correct size, I still would have returned them. They are very cheaply made and look uncomfortable. The sole of the shoe is a velvet material and would be very slippery on tile."
1.0,"Very thin material, not like pictures at all"
1.0,It was too small to fit my 5yr old daughter
1.0,"Cannot even open clasp . Me and husband both tried several times, won't budge!"
1.0,I returned it. The band was too tight and I felt like I was wearing a maternity dress.
1.0,These ARE NOT for adults. Maybe for a toddler to wear.  So tiny you cannot hardly see them.  I returned them the same day they came in.
1.0,"This item looks nothing like the picture, it's very dull and lifeless and comes in a crappy box that had the paper surface on it peeling off.  So disappointed as this looked like it would have been a great gift for Christmas."
1.0,Feels like material for a sack of potatoes and it has absolutely no stretch in the material at all!
1.0,"Really liked that I might have a shoe cover that would be cost-effective, reliable, and compact.  Not entirely the case.  While the shoe cover does the job it said it would, it should come with the caveat that quality of product might not be uniformly up to snuff.  The left shoe cover worked well while the right shoe cover did not.  Velcro stitching on right shoe cover came loose and zipper broke open under little-to-no strain after only 2 rides.  Left shoe? Dry as a bone.  Right shoe? Better luck next time.  If you buy these, maybe both left and right cover won't break. All I know is that I can't take that gamble gain.<br /><br />Update:  Went from 2 stars to 1 star.  Show does not hold up well.  Starting to come apart at the seams.  At this rate, it will not make it to March."
1.0,It wasn't at all the size or quality as the photo might show. Had a plastic smell too. Very poorly made.
1.0,Wayyyy too small! I have no boobs and I couldn’t even get the large over my chest
1.0,Wrong color.
1.0,Mine came dead or without battery. Who can I contact?
1.0,The craftsmanship on the peace that I received is nothing like the one you see in the picture. My mask was concaved in portions of the left side so that it was droopy. The mask straps aren't even secured in the positions that the picture shows them being secured. Ultimately the pictures are great but what I received was not.
1.0,Dress was just not for me.
1.0,"The tights them selves are nice but I did not receive the colors advertised. It was supposed to have pink, purple, gray, white and ivory. I didn’t receive the ivory (the whole reason I bought this pack). I receive two white pairs."
1.0,Hole during first hour of wear On the seam. Very thin and cheaply made
1.0,Nothing like the photo!
1.0,This product is cheap and an example of cultural appropriation.<br />If I could I'd give it -5 Stars I would. Completely inappropriate especially in 2021.
1.0,"I don't know if maybe I got the wrong dress, or they changed the dress, or what, but this was NOTHING like described. First off, the dress isn't cotton, it's rayon, and incredibly see-through. Second, it's hideous. The colors are the same but how they're distributed is totally different. All the color blocks are the same size so the dress just looks ugly! Also, I normally wear a M/L, the large in this fit like a small!"
1.0,Shredded straps in washer
1.0,Way too small and not loose at the shoulders. It was too sheer at the bodice in person.  Overall not worth the price.
1.0,This is how it looks like after six months of being carried in my pocket.
1.0,Umbrella would open inside out everytime.  Returned it.
1.0,The toe blew out in less than one day.
1.0,"As soon as I received these, one of the emeralds fell out.  I never got to wear them."
1.0,NOT TRUE TO SIZE!!!
1.0,"I got this product for my wife and it fits her as expected, but the quality of the product is very poor...very thin and bad quality material ...Dissapointing!"
1.0,This coat is so cute! The perfect weight. The first time wearing it though I was covered in feathers as other reviewers have said. So bummed!! Returning :(
1.0,Sizing not correct. Material not as expected.
1.0,This dress was not at all like the picture.  It was very thin and stiff material very uncomfortable to try on. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
1.0,Was defective.
1.0,These are cute but not convenient.  I was unable to find chains that would fit through the top to wear it and the seller's response was not helpful at at all.  I had to send these back and order some that could be worn as a diffuser necklace.  Don't waste your money!
1.0,They are very cheaply made ripped from the first time it was hanging on the belt the clip ripped off
1.0,Look very  inexpensive.
1.0,"I'm sick of Chinese knock-off clothing- they are poorly made, never fit, the materials are horrible and these pants do not fit at all. Next time I will research the &#34;company&#34; and make sure they are quality."
1.0,"I would live to give this item a good review but I can't. The words on it are wrong. It arrived an uncle is spelled wrong. It is spelled aunt. I ordered it again  and it arrived and nephew is spelled wrong, it's spelled niece. I ordered two and none of them have the correct terms."
1.0,The mask doesn't look like the picture the eye wholes are tiny you can't see out small mask and it's blue and smells very strong
1.0,Very cheap the lenses are not even lenses! They are like the temporary glasses you get from the eye doctor...
1.0,It's not blue as the picture shows. It's like dark blue or black color.
1.0,It broke while wearing it I throw it out
1.0,Poor quality and fit! No reason to keep it so it was returned.
1.0,Too long and terrible quality material is so thin and already my bebe on the side is coming off
1.0,"Looks plastic, not like bamboo.  Mouthpiece fell out almost immediately."
1.0,The white fabric isn't as opaque as the photo suggests. Can't find a way to wear this in public yet.
1.0,These are not 20g or .8 mm.<br />These are definitely an 18g or so. This is one of the rings next to a 20g L bend stud.
1.0,"Although the bracelet is very pretty, and I like it initially, the stone was lost when I wore the bracelet for the 5th time."
1.0,"cheaply made, not happy"
1.0,Much cheaper quality than what it looks like in the picture.
1.0,"Very miss leading.<br />Came in 2 long strands.<br />I expected this to look like the picture, not 2 love strings that do not connect!"
1.0,ran tiny
1.0,"Product runs very small. I’ve ordered 2 times. Tried to return both times and gotten no response from the vendor,  seems like a cozy play suit. Wish I could get the right size for my beagle"
1.0,"The upper band is too small and extremely restrictive.  There is no elasticity to the band of the socks that falls just below the knee.  After wearing the product for a day I was in severe pain after removing the socks. The socks when removed showed signs of choking off the flow of blood.  It was as if a tourniquet had been applied to my legs below the knee.  Until the product is changed individuals like myself will not be able to wear this product.  I am 6'4"" and weigh 254lbs.  Copperfit compression socks need to come under review and the elastic band needs to be made larger for us big guys with large calf muscles.  An eight inch band is not going to stretch enough to accommodate 17inch plus calves."
1.0,Cheap material shirt came in damaged shipper wants me to pay for return shipping not acceptable
1.0,"Really like the glasses, but ALL of my pair of glasses purchased, they're loose on the hinge screws.<br /><br />UPDATE: Both pair of glasses snapped at the same place, simply being in my pocket. As the picture shows, there seems to be a weak spot where it is cracking. The plastic is rather brittle (mechanically speaking ""brittle failure""). I am cleaning the glass with isopropyl alcohol before trying to mend it with Loctite Super Glue.<br /><br />Certainly would not recommend these glasses, though I loved them while they worked (less than an year)."
1.0,**This is my Opinion only**<br /><br />Some on the cheapest worst quality short I’ve EVER purchased. Material starting to come spray after first wear.
1.0,"I requested a one size fits all, not a small, and recieved a small, which is a bit aggravating. There is no way to loosen or tighten straps, and its definitely too small for a girl who is a size D."
1.0,Ordered a large for my husband. He wore it once. Washed it cold and machine dried. It now barely can button closed on him. We really liked the design. Not sure if I want to order a XXL for him as a replacement.
1.0,I ordered Mid Rise and got a High Rise instead...
1.0,"We first bought this at 1 size larger, sent it back and bought 2x larger. After washing the item has gone down to a LARGE SIZE. The fabric is very thin too. Look at something else to purchase"
1.0,They started falling apart and fading after the 1st wash
1.0,"I thought this was a beautiful top, so I went ahead and bought it for myself. I'm really disappointed with this purchase. It came in a vacuum sealed package and is made out of a material that doesn't feel comfortable on my skin. It is also very thin. You can see right through it! I tried it with a tank top underneath but with it being so thin, you can see it... which makes it look weird. Really unhappy with this product."
1.0,This product runs about three sizes smaller than you would expect.  If you are looking for a nice long white dress to wear to a formal event this dress is not for you.  The lace on the shirt of the dress is nice but the white dress itself is definitely is ultra thin and see through.  I was extremely disappointed since I bought this for a formal event but had to send it back.
1.0,Could not get on foot without great difficulty.
1.0,"Would not recommend, unless you need these only for one night. The clamps broke and are not sturdy enough for the weight of these earrings because they are heavy"
1.0,"Trash. The zipper was faulty upon arrival. I don't feel like dealing with return nonsense, so I replaced the zipper myself."
1.0,It was several sizes too small and the graphic faded in the wash.
1.0,Toooooo thin not worth a $1 small
1.0,"I should read the reviews, this thing broke the first day of use, really cheap made!!!"
1.0,The sizing is all wrong. I wear a large. I bought 3 different sizes! Finally I ordered an XXL and it was still too small. The sweater was NOTHING like the picture.
1.0,"Unit is backwards, clipped to gear fit no problem, but wont stay on wrist because little metal piece just falls out.  Not worth money."
1.0,"Ok, look REALLY closely... the frames has a rectangle/square running through the lenses all the way across. It looks like a reflection in this pic but it's not. The glasses look like something a person would wear in a night club to secretly scope people out. Extremely creepy looking! Oh yeah and the color is GOLD. Trust me on this one, don't do it."
1.0,Use it once and it already burst out for the ring holder
1.0,Very cheap quality. Not worth the money I purchase three of them at the same time one for me one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law for Mother’s Day and it’s not worth the money
1.0,Not my style got to retuned it
1.0,Cheaply made and cheap material. It's super thin and you can see through it. Can't contact the seller they charged my card twice and haven't been able to get a straight answer about why or a refund.
1.0,I had so hoped these would be nice because they looked so perfect in the picture but I have to return mine because they are crooked or the glasses are not symmetrical...not like someone sat on them on something but like when they were made in the warehouse something went terrible wrong not a problem you can fix without returning them. To be expected for me based on the price knew it was too good to be true. Maybe mine were just defective
1.0,"Too long for alto sax unless you are a 7 footer...probably works as it should for tenor sax, but doesn't meet our needs"
1.0,"THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED A DAY LATE, DOES NOT WORK AND IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I WANT MY MONY FOR THE PRODUCT, THE POSTAGE I HAVE PAID AND THE POSTAGE I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO SEND THIS BACK."
1.0,Material did not look like what was used in the pic and was not flattering.  It fit tight under the chess where it ties but not in a supportive way. It cut off circulation and hung oddly once wrapped around the neck. There'll be no pic as this top was not cute on me or my daughter.
1.0,Jogging pants are cheaply made.  Cheap white trim sewn half way down the legs of  the pants.  Not what I expected and would not recommend for purchase.
1.0,"Disappointed with sizing recommendation.  I follow guidelines provided and I still feel it was too large.  Also after wearing it once, it pilled every place my purse strap touched the fabric.  Very disappointed"
1.0,Reeaaalllly cheaply made and doesn't even fit around my ankle!
1.0,I wore the ring a few times and the silver began to wear off
1.0,Doesn’t fit on an adults head!
1.0,It is a beautiful ring but the stones on the sides of the ring rubbed my adjacent fingers.  It was very uncomfortable to me.  I wish it would have had just the big stone.  That is what I thought it was when I bought it.
1.0,"I liked the jackets, but the sleeves are cut small in the arms. It’s as if the sleeve sizes got mixed up."
1.0,"Ordered the orange one and got the black one instead. >=(<br />After reading a previous review I'm not going to bother<br />and return it. Don't order this one unless you don't care<br />that it's black. While it gets the job done and fits our<br />grill, I still expected to get what I ordered!"
1.0,The product was marked mens XL. It was a men's Medium at best.
1.0,This item wasn’t nothing like the picture I wish that I can give it a thumbs down disappointed
1.0,This product is see-through so plan on buying a size bigger. If you actually are a extra-large size man it will not fit you.
1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would. It faded after not even ONE full day. Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,This is a terrible product. Claimed to be cashmere (which given the price I did not expect) but it’s just made of some itchy fabric. The area by your finger tips is also awkwardly tight so it’s very uncomfortable. Would not recommend.
1.0,small and short
1.0,Could not get my foot into these boots.  I normally wear a 10 medium but I ordered 11 because it said they run small my gosh it was more like a size 7 I was very disappointed the boots are beautiful but I couldn’t even get the top of my foot down into them; returned them.
1.0,"We opened the package and plugged it in to charge for the first time. No indication of charging, even after 15 minutes. Instructions are simple - plug it in and it should charge. Returned it."
1.0,"After handling the sox, I seem to have painful microscopic needle-like fibers (copper ?) imbedded in my fingers. Very unpleasant."
1.0,Material is plastic-y and cheap.
1.0,There is so much fabric and so many layers it’s suffocating and the fabric keeps getting in my mouth if I try to talk. These are awful
1.0,Fit = Comfortable<br />UV = Great<br />The pics are after 1 use.  Wipe dry after every swim or get the eaten away coating result of leaving a few drops of pool water on them.  Tested my water...all balanced.
1.0,Very cloudy so they were hard to see. Not labeled Venice murano glass.
1.0,"I wear an XS in Lulu. I am 5’7”, 120 lbs.<br />My 10 year old wears a Youth 10 Slim. These fit her. PERFECTLY. They are beautiful. Love these pants. If these come in a 3XL, I may order and see if I can squeeze into them."
1.0,Cool idea but Button batteries fall out easily. Dangerous. Ended up throwing them all away.
1.0,"I loved it, it looked very nice, but it broke the first time I wore it and due to that, I lost it, as it fell off at a New Years Eve party, it was too crowded and it was too dark to look for it."
1.0,I thought this was a bargain. But it came with a whole down the side seam. Not worth the hassle of returning.
1.0,I ordered the seak natural sandals. The picture shows the natural color. I received a snakeskin pattern.
1.0,I loved the color and style but the sizing isn't correct.
1.0,I’ve had this band for less than a month and it already broke. Super disappointing.
1.0,Not a good purchase. Spend the extra money on a shoe that will last and fit comfortably.
1.0,The costume came with a hole in the seam in the back. Cheaply and poorly made.
1.0,Another cheap pair of sun glass holders. The strap is too short and the stitching starting coming out as soon as I attached my sunglasses for the first time.
1.0,Sizing is incorrect. Extremely small. Returned.
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on.
1.0,the green is more of a yellow green than a sage green. Also I know that they used some other photo since the zipper on mine is gold while the photo’s is silver. The color isn’t too bad but it’s false advertising. Good thing I am good at styling outfits so it will be okay.
1.0,"I bought three colors- red, black, and grey. The black and red fit like they should and I love them. The grey is a completely different size! It’s almost twice the size of the other two!"
1.0,"The material is stiff, fit is boxy.  The description says button zip up which is misleading.  It only has a zipper in the front to close it up - no buttons with the zipper.  Seam on left side of the zipper and pocket has frayed after the first wash.  Only one pocket at each side of the bottom.  No pockets at the top chest area."
1.0,"Liked the belt a lot while it lasted, but unfortunately the ratchet pin repeatedly falls out and now I've finally completely lost it making the belt unusable after only a few months of use."
1.0,"Poorly made, good enough to sweat in but that’s about all would NOT recommend, plenty of other choices"
1.0,Not worth the money This item is super small and not the same as the measurements this item is not made with any type of quality and looks pretty cheap for the price that you pay passages looking somewhere else
1.0,Not actually water proof
1.0,[[VIDEOID:486ff88e470c5c269fe40c2402ab47ae]] I bought this a few months ago but because my kids were not in school last year due to covid my son did not use it until September of this year.  So I cannot request a refund because it was may of last year that I purchased this even though they only used it from September 5th of this year 2021. He only used for 4 weeks until both the zippers broke and the backpack does not close at all. The material seems decent but obviously the zippers are cheap and will not hold up.  my son is 6 and only carries papers in his backpack so nothing even heavy. And they still broke. Pretty disappointing.
1.0,TOO SMALL!!
1.0,Came apart at the seams literally on day one. And now its completely fallen apart. Was really disappointed because i got this for a birthday present for my fiance.
1.0,"I got a some damage hat and applied for an exchange twice, but the seller ignored it.<br />I've a third request, but I don't know if seller will send me an exchange product this time.<br />As you can see in the picture I attached, there is orange paint on the hat. Also the rubber band is stretched out.<br />It’s a worth than price, but there's a problem with the seller's attitude, so I don't want to recommend this hat."
1.0,Didn't even get to wear it. Washed on cold and hung to dry. Went to wear it the next day and it had shrunk to the point it wasn't wearable.  Very disappointing
1.0,DONT BUY!!!  What I received is nothing like the picture... it is very flimsy and is all wavy nothing like the pict.
1.0,Please don't waste your money buying this product. Material is the cheapest possible quality and the small fits like an XL.
1.0,Cheaply made & broken.<br />NEVER AGAIN
1.0,Don't buy!  Not worth it.  So cheaply made.
1.0,"Me and my girls (6 and 4) opened the package, discovering the shoes were narrow and a small size. The 4 year old was pleased, but they are really too small for the 6 year old. I could not tell from the pictures, though. Well, ok so far. My girls run away to play dress up, 3 minutes later a huge hullabaloo: Two of the shoes had already lost their bow! After 3 minutes of play - really!??? I calm my girls down and get two additional pairs out of the plastic package and guess what - 5 minutes later another riot breaks lose because a plastic heart on the third pair and another bow on the fourth pair fell off as well! I almost lost my mind, wanting to send back that junk instantly but my little one broke out in tears, wanting to keep the shoes because the colors are so cute... Alright, I fixed everything with stapler and glue and now my girls just line up the shoes for looking at them because they are afraid they might fall apart again when in use. My advice: Do not waste your money on such cheaply made product. It is not worth a dime!"
1.0,"It is just a black T-shirt, it doesn’t look like the one in the picture at all it’s just a plain black ugly T-shirt."
1.0,The band around the edges was loose
1.0,Flat as a pancake.
1.0,Not what picture shows at all. Have to go through the return process now which I hate to go through. Totally not what picture shows
1.0,Too large(or too high) in the crotch area. No patting on the breast area.
1.0,This is one parachute material and only hangs to mid butt
1.0,Very thin and VERY SEE THROUGH! I normally wear a large in leggings so I ordered the large and they are way too big which causes them to fall down. Not worth the money which is sad because the pattern is super cute.
1.0,"Latch broke, lost my watch while trying on clothes in the store. I didn’t notice it was not on my wrist for two hours. Luckily it was turned in to customer service."
1.0,The bracelet has no clasp. It will cost more to return it than is worth.
1.0,This is not a real sweat shirt.  It is a strange feeling slick shirt with no stretch to it.  The top part is big and the waist is small.  Not a good fit or it does not feel good when I wanted to return the shipping was to China and was going to cost more than it was worth.
1.0,I could use it for only a month after that<br />Stopped working it was used maybe?
1.0,This shirt was humongous! The arms were small. Can we have sizes that are comparative to American 1x plz?!😲
1.0,This will stick on to my cantaloupes but won't pull my cantaloupes together. There's just too much cantaloupe and not enough sticky force.
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made. Much smaller than expected.
1.0,"Cheap butterfly closer? Does not feel like steel, it is sharp so it damage your wrist. Leather looks so cheap, I bought it to replace the band of a $200 watch that now looks like $20"
1.0,The fabric on inside by zipper is already pulling apart!! I have only been using it for 2 weeks!!!
1.0,Already review how awfully small this was....I even ordered 3 sizes up and it wouldn't even button
1.0,Giving one star! The top had really small cups despite me ordering a 2X. I wear a 38DDD and top would have fit if not for the underwire. Horrible
1.0,"Feels mostly acrylic, no wool content. Feel mis-led. Returning it."
1.0,"I was able to remove the pin for one watch; second watch, the end of the tool started bending- not good!!"
1.0,Way to small.  Couldn't close it
1.0,I ordered a size 2T.  This is a product from China as all the tags are written in Chinese.  Beware that the cultural difference is evident in the size.  This is no larger than a 9-12 month article.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Way off on the sizing. I ordered it because it came in 2x and was a loose fit cut. The 2x is at best an American large.
1.0,"Don’t mind the glasses. Too big for my liking.<br />Only problem was when I opened the Amazon packaging I was faced with a box that looked like it got drug Accross the Rocky Mountains, chewed on by a pack of wolves before NASA dropped them from the international space station. Other then that lenses are nice."
1.0,"These are very low quality.  I do understand they are grown and variations are expected.  The issue is the two pearls were so different looking and of such low quality, I'm surprised the supplier even let them out the door!  Do yourself a favor and pay a bit more from a different seller."
1.0,"Top tie assured me it would have my order with more than enough time for my event. As time grew near, it was obvious by the order sheet that my order had in a week and a half, not been processed. They never took the time to contact me to let me know. I had to scramble to get the items needed at higher prices than I had anticipated, taking two day trips, having lost two days of work (unpaid vacation) to accomodate my needs that they had assured me of, then failed to come through with merchandise ordered. then, still a week later, still haven't received my refund. This is dispicable. A cummerbund and bow tie."
1.0,The material is very see through and the dress smells really bad. I'm returning it
1.0,THEY WERE BIG AND JUST LOOK CHEAP !!
1.0,Terrible quality.
1.0,This product is ugly and cheap I do not recommend it was a disappointment
1.0,"This is not what I ordered. I ordered the romper with the zipper cut through the chest but the one pictured is what I recieved. The knee holes were way below my knee,,this outfit just wasn't what I expected at all!! I was so upset as it did not fit properly and I had to find something last minute to wear. I will not be ordering from this seller again."
1.0,"Material Trash , Thin Cheap Asf ! Sizing Weird Too . Idk When Ima Wear This Lol"
1.0,sizing totally off.  2 sizes too small
1.0,There are 40 finger lights in an order. Only 26 of the 40 lights work. Disappointing.
1.0,"I bought these March 23rd 2018, they are falling apart now.  They are size 11 which I normally wear.  I have another pair exactly the same, they are still good, just worn."
1.0,does NOT look like the photo
1.0,"This ring isn't 925 silver, it's plated copper. The finish wore off in 3 days. I like costume jewelry, but not when I'm buying silver."
1.0,no mention of the bell bottom cuff...not a cool look for a guy..
1.0,"This tank top is HUGE. I am short, but not small. I normally would get a large but ordered a medium based on reviews. It was enormous, so I exchanged it for a small. It was still too big. I think the cut was intended to have the fabric drape, but the material was a little too thick to properly drape. It just tented out in the least flattering way."
1.0,Didn’t like product at all
1.0,Naehhhh.  Raggedy...expensive ....I have the grey and black one totally different from it ...This hat not what I expected... so to all the u hats lovers out. I don’t recommend this item....I don’t even know how to return this items and get my money back ...
1.0,"They got here earlier than expected , they are cute but like really , really small, they are more for like a 12 year old. I wont buy again."
1.0,Cheap quality and was dirty when taken out of the package.
1.0,Sleeves too long fabric poor.
1.0,One of the rings doesn’t open...
1.0,"The color is not pure. The white is not really white, and the black looks faded black. The worst part is that the plugs are rounded at 1 end. Looks very very weird and ugly. If you like plugs that are flat then these are not for you"
1.0,Chinese garbage charge $11 for something that should be sold for 2. Arrived late and damaged do not buy!!!!
1.0,"I’d give it 0 stars if I could. These things are awful! Because they’re made of silicone, they’re very difficult to get into your shoe eyelets, and 100x worse trying to get them out. They’re also way too small for an adult size foot. Don’t waste your time or money!"
1.0,"This dress is awful. The material feels like burlap. Not soft at all. The color was dingy looking peach, not blush as described. The belt is as stiff as the dress. I returned it the next day."
1.0,"Fit really weird, I returned it."
1.0,"Cheap, pitiful, poor quality...must view watch face at an angle to see the time.<br />The crystal is wavy, the band says leather....wrong...<br />artificial imitation generic black plastic...never again<br />After all the years Ive ordered from amazon, you'd think I would learn."
1.0,It broke and the neck piece did not reach to my neck
1.0,Definitely but a size smaller. I ordered S but the size of it is more like an M.<br />The quality however is superb.
1.0,Very bad product. It just got dark fast.
1.0,"I like these wood watches.  My problem with this one... The face is too big and the glass is slightly domed.  I don't care for a dome glass in fear of it scratching easily.  Honestly I don't mind the big face, the problem is (I will do my best to describe this)... there is a link on each side of the watch attached to the band.  In the photo it appears that the attachment can move but it doesn't.  This is what make the watch seem big because it slightly hangs over each side of my wrist.  The other thing I am not happy with are the links in the band, they are very rigid so there is little movement.  If it kinks up, you cannot just shake it loose, you have to manually press the link back in place.  The concern there?  The link might break.  Over all, I still get complements and I do like the color.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/01/16<br />I was not too happy with the size of the watch face... but, now that I have seen it in the sun I am very disappointed.  I do not wear this watch daily... maybe once a week.  The hard to move links have rubbed off the red dye and now the watch looks cheep.  (Is it really rose wood?)  I have changed my rating from a 3 to a 1.  The other wood watches I have have held up beautifully.  This one has failed.  I would not recommend this to anyone at any price."
1.0,Not for plus size big busted women.i got a 2xl and I can't even get it over my head.
1.0,The picture is way better than the product.  The outside is not very giving. The lining is some sort of coarse fabric that is very stiff. If you had a shirt made of it the shirt would be very itchy.
1.0,"Didn't come with all pieces and does not fit larger sizes, very small. Returned."
1.0,"The lanyard I received was dirty, stained and missing the hook to hold keys and ID badge."
1.0,"This handbag is made of some sort of plastic material.  I tried to send it back, but the mfg told me it costs more to send it back then what it is worth. So I gave it to the thrift store."
1.0,"I thought this was for a set, as pictured. There was no option to select a size. I needed a larger one than the 10mm that was automatically sent."
1.0,"Pendant is very tiny, and the neck lace is thin like a dental floss.  This is the worst purchase you can do."
1.0,I ordered this and waited for it to come and it was a long time coming then when it did come it doesn’t work I had ordered another one at the same time it came early and by the time the other one came was too late to send it back
1.0,I ordered a 38 and it won't even go around me like a normal 38 it is more like a 34 or 36. So I can't even wear them.
1.0,"I got my 8 year old these boots in black, she loved them so much that she didn't tell me they had holes in them EVERYWHERE after a few months of use, because she didn't want me to throw them away.  Needles to say, they were indeed thrown away and I bought her a similar looking pair in a different brand. These are probably fine if they will only be worn lightly and occasionally, but I wouldn't waste my money on these again."
1.0,"garbage, find Rossi brand"
1.0,an extra large hah! it looks like it could fit a 7 year old ! couldn't imagine how small this was going to come inl.
1.0,The item that came did not match the picture. I ordered from the same link as last time and got a different pair... they have a strange thread pattern on them around the distress... will be returning.
1.0,The worse item ever!! This dress is nothing as shown in the picture or in the discription !!! Total waste of money total disappointment
1.0,Bought this backpack for my first trip to Asia. Packed the essentials. By day 2 one of the handles broke! Cant get a hold of manufacturer.
1.0,Very pretty in person. I'm a size 12 ordered an XL. The cup runs very small maybe a B cup would fit in the XL.
1.0,Too big and did not look as good as in the picture.
1.0,This is so very obviously sewn crooked. Which is really sad because it’s a cute cut and cute fabric. Wish it would’ve worked!
1.0,"Beautiful, but it's twice now my skin got red, open painful wounds when in contact with these earring. This suggests that they are not 925 sterling silver. I feel I have been lied to by a foreign company. Beware. No longer able to return."
1.0,Mini socks that roll up in your shoes. Unable to wear.
1.0,He devuelto el producto y no me han dado razón.
1.0,Not great material for the shirt. Runs small
1.0,Not accurate as described.
1.0,The fit is fine but the material is thinner than some lingerie. Defeats the purpose of a sweater.
1.0,"So disappointed. Material, color, print, it's all really bad. Definitely not worth $32. Maybe $10 at most. Don't chance it."
1.0,"My original order only had 30 pieces but should’ve been 60, and less than half were the elf hats. I called Amazon and they provided great customer service and sent a replacement right away. The replacement package stated 60 but only had 30 items. Luckily I only needed 60 and between the two orders I had a total of 60. I think this company is terrible!"
1.0,"... to make like sized pairs.  VERY thin socks. Says ""Hanes"" on the socks, but there is NO WAY these are authentic Hanes. Will NOT buy again. I was going to donate these to a shelter, but I am going to just use them for dust rags. Two hundred and forty dust rags. o well"

1.0,The jumper potion is very cheaply made and thin
1.0,Product dont fir the way it look.
1.0,I’m 5’3” 175. DD and the xl was a decent fit. I usually wear a medium/large top and size 10/ medium bottoms. The length is good. Not quite as long as it appears on the model.  I was however so disappointed the green that arrived is olive. Definitely not the green pictured.
1.0,Not flattering at all.  I'm returning this.
1.0,"I didn't like this hat. The back flap is too short, and has a big seam in it, so it doesn't even protect your neck. The side flaps are too far forward, and just end up being annoying and blocking your vision. There isn't much adjustment you can do with this, and the materials are all really cheap. Spend your money on a better hat."
1.0,"Although the colors were pretty, the band was wider than I had thought and the fabric was very stiff.  It felt uncomfortable when I tried them on so they were returned."
1.0,"My husband is a 30/34 so I originally ordered a M, following the size guide. They were like a XS, skinny waist and stopped mid-shin. So I returned them, was refunded and was told I didn't need to return. I ordered an XL and that's what is shown in the photo. These are for BOYS. Not adult sizes, unless you have short legs. Will be returning these too, and now don't have pants for him to wear for tomorrow. At least the shipping was fast, so they get 2 stars..."
1.0,"This case isn't even close to the same case pictured.  If you are at all concerned about color, do not buy this case!<br />The case that arrived was a faded lifeless lilac color vs. the one pictured as a vibrant purple with animal print.<br />This is the most blatant misrepresentation I have ever experienced on Amazon.<br />I may return it purely out of principle ."
1.0,Does not look like the picture
1.0,"The material is a printed polyester, the kind that costumes are made out of, so the dress looks cheap. If the material was different this would be cute since it seems well made."
1.0,Dress is pretty but very thin material and very cheap I will not buy a dress again..
1.0,Not what I was looking for and cheaply made.  Back it went.
1.0,The middle left and bottom drawer will not open on mine when it is unlocked. I have jewelry inside- any suggestions how to get it open w/o damaging the box?
1.0,Its true the backing does fall off right away

1.0,Hat very thin doesn't stay adjusted for head suze
1.0,It was a bit baggy and the arms were like bells. Its hard to see it in the pic. I did not like that. So I returned it.

1.0,The first shipment the lenses were in backwards. The replacement shipment the lenses were in backwards.  Don't bother with these!!!
1.0,"Don’t buy this. It’s sooo cheap, the fabric is nearly translucent and it took over a month to get to me. In summary: The quality is worse than the cheapest piece of clothing at forever21."
1.0,Be aware that you aren't likely to receive the shoes pictured because there is a glitch in Amazon's system. I have attempted to order these cute crab shoes but instead received brown Dylan Mini Shoez.
1.0,"All and all the cost was NOT worth the jacket. It was very cheep fabric, put together poorly, inaccurate sizeing and not as pictured.<br /><br />This jacket RUNS SMALL! I ordered a 2x because I was using as a Halloween costume, but was going to give to someone else after. I typically wear a medium to large and the 2XL was almost snug on me. The jacket pictured whenI ordered had no writing on it which is what I wanted. It came with ""Pink Ladies"" on it. Again fine for the costume, but not for after. One day wearing this jacket and it is basically destroyed. There are snags all over the jacket from wearing to the office for the day, and a party later that day. Nothing I participated in all day wouldn't have been enough to destroy clothing."
1.0,Wouldnt recomend.
1.0,Cheap metal and really difficult to put on by yourself. It’s has 3 parts for some reason. Not a great buy.

1.0,These broke after only a few months.
1.0,These smell sooooooooo horrible.  Like turpentine.  Tried washing them the smell does not come off.  Going to use them as cupcake toppers but that will not be possible.  I don’t even want to give these as party favors because I’m afraid the parents will be offended at how bad the smell is .

1.0,Too small. This is a little girls coat not a ladies coat.
1.0,"Returned, too small, cheap material and disappointing."
1.0,Before you try to put on your child face try them out because they make everything blurry.  Not only me but my son and all of his friends says that. They ask if it's prescription glasses.

1.0,"The set didn’t have any kind of fit to it, very boxy."
1.0,Terrible quality fake pictures.
1.0,Horrible dress! This thing is a lot of work to get into. It's like a maze with those straps & it was tight between the straps. I know its supposed to be flowy but its just too loose. I am 5'2 106 lbs for ref.

1.0,Not sure if I like it.. it never showed up..
1.0,"This bra does a lot more squishing than supporting. It's not particularly comfortable for extended wear, it fits more like a binder than a sports bra. Just walking down the stairs was uncomfortable let alone trying to run in this."
1.0,Horrible!!!! Wore once and the gold plating completely wore off!!!!
1.0,"Worked well for about a week, no longer keeping time. Great looking watch, my wife loved it till it stopped working."

1.0,"Misleading item description, since they are not Thermal Long Johns, instead should be listed as Nylon-Lycra Men's Leggings. Beware of why you are purchasing these. If you are looking for a warm pair of Long Johns as I was, this is not your product. If you are looking for a pair of leggings with ample package space, then order away!"

1.0,"My first time wearing one of the black pairs (which I mainly bought them for) I noticed a small hole on the seem of the pants on my backside shortly after putting them on. I figured it was a fluke, but within an hour my boyfriend pointed out that there was multiple holes that formed separately from each other. I am so upset and disappointed in the quality of these pants after buying them based on the reviews I read. I would return them if I hadn’t already taken them all out of their individual packaging. In the second picture, I put my hand inside the pants so you could see the holes better."

1.0,I ordered two of these and neither of them fit me... do NOT BUY!! 👎👎👎
1.0,"These Noise Reduction Ear Muffs are very difficult to put on.  To me they are poorly designed for this reason. I have own many others made by other manufacturers, and none of them were difficult to put on.  To put these on, you have to use spend too much time holding them and adjusting them with 2 hands, and they do not adjust easily (the plastic parts do not want to slide easily).  It can often take 10 seconds or longer to put them on."
1.0,"This would be a cute dress, but structured horribly and not true to size."
1.0,No las volvería a comprar... No son como en la foto...
1.0,Head flopped forward; fan not powerful enough.
1.0,The sweater arrived in very poor condition.  It looked like it had sat in the sun and faded on the fold marks.  This must have sat in a warehouse or storage for years.  Terrible quality.  Total mess of a sweater and one of my worst purchases through Amazon.  I returned for a refund.
1.0,doesn’t look anything like that picture.
1.0,Lenses popped out why just trying to wipe off fingerprints. Low quality glass scratches easily. Avoid. Poor craftsman ship.
1.0,This dress is not worth the price. The material is very cheap and poor quality sewing. I want a refund.
1.0,Esta duro del cierre y se me dificulta ponerlo en mi mano por ello
1.0,"These seemed great at first- then after walking in them 1 day I started getting blisters. I tried to use them a few more days, then one of the shoes seemed to fill with air and I could feel it every time I took a step. I had bought these for a trip and ended up leaving them in the trash."
1.0,One earrings was facing backwards.
1.0,Not very strong don’t use on anything you don’t want to lose I tugged lightly on one after screwing it together and cable pulled right out of it
1.0,The blouse looked nothing like it did in the picture. The quality was horrible. The front did not fit right
1.0,"Waaaaaaay expensive for a mask.  It's thick and doesnt fit well, hard to breath in working out or running.  Don't waste your money.  Buy the OR mask kit.  Half the price way nicer."
1.0,This is a piece of material<br />It's terrible super cheap looking
1.0,Mirrored coating wore down after three months and are now unusable. I don't recommend these.
1.0,Pants are not high waist a large fits really small and al the buttons do not snap
1.0,this is nice but even in very cold water it faded..now I cannot wear it
1.0,"Gobi's 1-year warranty is apparently not true. These failed after less than a year, but I could not get support from Gobi because I did not purchase from Gobi's website. Terrible service from Gobi.<br /><br />Also, I'm not happy about a $200 product that fails after a year."
1.0,Broke within a day of getting it
1.0,This product is no where near what I was expecting. I was expecting them to be as big hoops like they appear to be in the picture with the model. These things are tiny and absolutely not worth the $18 that I paid for them. Plus they are super thin.  I’m very disappointed.
1.0,"Metal feels cheap. Worked as intended for a year and after had to fix the time everyday until it was moving only one hour after three have passed... Other than that, great watch for the price :("
1.0,"The arms are not aligned, so the glasses sit crooked, and it's not comfortable.  (I broke my last pair trying to straighten them.)<br /><br />It's a simple test, set the glasses on a table.  If the bottoms of the lenses and the ends of the arms are all on the table everything's good.  If not, you have a problem.  In my case one arm is about 1/2"" in the air."
1.0,I don't like it!
1.0,It’s 80% polyester
1.0,Lasted a week before it broke
1.0,"Runs very small, cheap quality. Don’t waste your money"
1.0,My son wore these shoes one time for about two hours and the Velcro came unraveled so the shoe won’t stay on anymore. How disappointing! I will be returning these
1.0,Got stuck in my ear and I had to break with a pair of pliers. Never again.
1.0,"I have a nice old watch and the last time I had the battery replaced, it did not last very long.  Cost too much and then I had to send it for repair.  Moisture.  Weeks turned into a month or more. I thought this would be a cheap alternative.<br /><br />The dial is hard to read even in good light.  It is hard to program.  It somehow keeps flipping to military time.<br /><br />It does keep basic time and that is all I wanted.  Just hard to read the time and hard to program.  The hourly beep is not too loud and that is okay."
1.0,even though the description stated it would. it isn't even close
1.0,The zipper was broken as soon as I opened the package. I couldn’t even try it on bc the zipper is bent back and snags the material.
1.0,"Just received the sun glasses and so very disappointed.  They are lopsided! Can't straighten them out, made unevenly.  He won't send back because it cost half of what we spent. If he could go less than 1 star he would. It goes to show buy cheap comes cheaply made!"
1.0,"Cute, but I'll never know how it looks to wear. Broke while opening."
1.0,When I opened the package part of the handle fell to the floor. When I examined the handle the other piece fell of in my hand. I sent it back. The color was exactly what I needed.
1.0,Quality of material is questionable.
1.0,This is the replacement. The original ring had three stones fall off within the first 24 hours. After emailing the seller I was able to get a replacement. I put this replacement on less than 5 hours ago and two stones are missing.<br />I understand you get what you pay for. However; I feel like a product should last longer than 24 hours before it starts to deteriorate. Very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,"Came in on time but is too small and way too tight for a xxl-xxxl. My husband and I have had a really hard year, and we go without a lot, including food so our children are taken care of. I finally caught a break & had some extra money to buy him a gift to help lift his spirits and now it's too late to return and buy something else I time for Christmas. I'm really upset with the actual size of this hoodie. All I wanted to do was give my husband a little something because he works so hard out in the cold, and rain for us and we can never get ahead. Not it's a bust."
1.0,Horrible ! I bought XL and they are too small for me!!!
1.0,Not happy returning
1.0,One word “cheap”. Don’t buy!
1.0,Will probably never wear . The slit is too big
1.0,"While the dress itself is beautiful, I do not appreciate receiving a previously worn, pet hair covered,  and apparently returned item in lieu of the new dress I purchased."
1.0,The material is so thin that every sock has a hole in it already.  At most I was able to get 2-3 uses out of each pair.
1.0,"When first using this product, it felt comfortable, then after a few months working with them, they become run down, non water resistant boots"
1.0,The clasp does not stay hooked. Would not recommend this.
1.0,Top came in with a broken strap and the side ties on the bottom weren't laced right. Immediately sent back.
1.0,The color easily faded away after 1 wash
1.0,"This is weirdly binding in the shoulder area. You can't raise your arms, and it's costing $6 to return a shirt that doesn't have a normal fit. Very disappointing, will not order from Haggar again."
1.0,Did not care for quality of material
1.0,The size chart is not accurate.  Have to send it back and order another.  What a hassle.
1.0,Terrible fabric! Very rough and itchy. I will be returning! It’s very cheaply made.
1.0,"I didn't pay much for the 3 chains, and I got what I paid for."
1.0,Short and very cheap looking. Like... A two year old ran into the fabric store and made it himself.
1.0,Wouldn't stay on my nose. Lost it on the first day. Was so excited to receive it- unfortunately it didn't last ling
1.0,"I ordered a size bigger than it said I should and it would barley fit on my dog. If you're petite you may have better luck, but it's too short and too small"
1.0,Nicely constructed. But way too small
1.0,"Theses shoes were a complete waste of money. They were used by my 4yr old fl3x and they frayed almost immediately.The stitching around the fabric and sole of the shoe got a hole first time he worm them to the pool. I gave or another shot, more frayig amd the colors became dull.  Don't waste your money  look elsewhere."
1.0,The one with the white beads broke the first time I wore it. Need to see about replacement.
1.0,Cheap.  They broke after wearing them twice.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Have loved my previous Simply Southern masks, this one had a different type material, fell apart after first washing."
1.0,"SO the overall vibe of the dress is as pictured. However, the pattern is a lot larger than shown and some of the white marks are in the shape of lips... not just a random white marking but LIPS. The fabric is also very thin and the buttons aren't tortoise shell, there white. The shape of the dress is also not as flow as the pictures. It's made from a cheap almost like raincoat fabric that's really stiff and doesn't move like you would want it too. I hope this helps someone because they do charge you shipping to return!"
1.0,cheap material..
1.0,"Very cheap product for the $40.  The sound effects are poor, very limited and the watch barely lights up to make it useful as a time piece."
1.0,Most of the earrings I received came in like this. Really disappointed.
1.0,Poor by comparison to ThinOptics.  Half the price but not worth the savings.
1.0,Shirt is very short!
1.0,The pins that connects the band to the watch was not included  reached  out to seller multiple time with the promise to send them and never got the pins. Cant even use the band for that reason it is a nice looking band otherwise
1.0,I didn't even try on.
1.0,"Terrible sizing. I'm a 34D chest and the size small was huge on me. Their sizing chart is very inaccurate. Very, very thin material and cheaply stitched."
1.0,"The dress was sewn wrong, I’m assuming. The seam runs down the front. :( It’s very noticeable with the polka dot pattern. I recently had surgery and needed something comfortable to lounge around my home so I kept it."
1.0,"Photograph looks much better than the item in real life.  Bottom line, a hot mess!  Cheap polyester, which is the wrong fabric for this design.  Don't waste your time ordering this item."
1.0,The side zipper is NOT a place to keep small things.  Its a detail zipper completely open to under neath of boot with no “pocket” I have messaged the seller for a refund
1.0,Horrible. It blew out one of my ears trying to get it in. Do not buy these ever! So much blood...
1.0,"Bad news...<br />I bought the watch a few months ago. One of the stopwatch related dials started failing to return to zero when reset.<br />I sent the watch back for repair or swap... They have had it longer than I originally did when purchased. They keep telling me to be patient, but enough is enough. I want a refund or new watch. ...I don't even know what time it is, since I don't have a watch."
1.0,Glasses are nice but after only 2 days the lenses started falling out
1.0,Filter circle fall off after first wash. Bad quality.
1.0,This item is useless for my helmet without the t-bar extension. I wish I read the recent reviews before buying. I'm not sure how this is even receiving positive reviews unless these mistakes have become a recent trend. Do not buy unless you're willing to take a chance.
1.0,I've sent it back after trying to set the date and day correctly. No watch is worth that much trouble to me.
1.0,Did not like at all<br />Hood flopped around and fit poorly around the head<br />Fell over eyes or too far back
1.0,"Super cute, but very very cheap!!! Feels like its made out of costume material!!!"
1.0,Not a fan of the material and it looks a little different then the picture.
1.0,Fabric is not super comfy but pattern is nice. Returned because the seam ripped under the arm
1.0,very  small not well made
1.0,"These pajamas seemed very cute in the photos, but they are ill-fitting and really cheap-looking in real life. The fabric has a shine to it and reminds me of a Halloween costume. I wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,These are not made for thick curvy women. I had to give them to my sister. I ordered a 16 btw.
1.0,"Poorly made, color of the pants went on the white lettering after one wash, done as per instructions. The lettering became pink. A hastle to return, thankfully Amazon came to the rescue after I sent them a photo of the product. They covered the return postage."
1.0,"It’s cute, but way too tight for the purpose! I put it on with my blouse and it looked awful!"
1.0,The scrunch is so high its not even in my crack. It just looks like normal leggings at the butt and then ruched at the lower back
1.0,"This watch is not what I expected.  It needs to be wound up and isn't clear how to do it.  I don't have the patience for this kind of watch watch. I need a battery, I returned it."
1.0,They were cute and I wore them once.  But then I put them away in my bag and when I got home they were in several pieces.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter who wears an extra small or small. It did not fit. It was too small in the chest and pulled too tight so that it couldn't button closed at the neck. If it had fit it would have been really flattering on her and I would have purchased a couple more... but alas I will be returning it instead.
1.0,Not worth it.  I donated it shortly after getting it.  It wasn't even worth breaking it down to use the fabric in my sewing stash.
1.0,these looked very thin and cheap i did not love them
1.0,"I bought them for 15 and then the price dropped to 6, because that's what it should be. The production cost is probably just 10 cents. Not cute, they look really tacky, who wants a tacky golden V letter on a shiny pair of glasses, V like Vuitton?!"
1.0,"Can’t clasp the earring. So difficult to get the metal piece to lock. It’s like trying to thread a needle. To much work for me, and I never got them clasped while on my ear. To bad because earing is pretty.  I will be returning these."
1.0,Wrong sizing
1.0,"While the construction is decent, the socks don't stay up - not enough elastic on the top."
1.0,Broke in a week
1.0,"I thought these would be comfortable and have great support, but after walking in them for 2 hours my arches hurt so bad  had to take them off.  My feet hurt for 2 days after. Unwearable, now unreturnable and unhappy. Will not be buying Vionic again"
1.0,The glasses are considerably larger than they appear in the picture. They look quite ridiculous
1.0,I would not order again.  The colored plastic bridge across the nose is very visible to the wearer and distracting--it infringes on what you see.  I have purchased other models of rimless glasses that manage to connect the two lenses without coming into the field of vision.  Poorly designed--should never have been marketed this way.
1.0,You get what you pay for - super cheap looking and feeling
1.0,Fit is great but I washed it once and it looks like it was washed 100 times. Very disappointed.
1.0,Flimsy material - wore one and it fell<br />All ragged when washed
1.0,They broke off and were cheaply made
1.0,"The material feels like plastic, it doesn't stretch, it runs too small. it sucks"
1.0,"Not what I expected, thin, no support."
1.0,The site says only a SMALL or XX-Large size was available.  I ordered a SMALL.  I got the XXXLarge.  I could get 3 of me in this thing.  I like the quality and color.  Too bad about the size.
1.0,"This was basically a large piece of unhemmed, thin fabric in a loop to be a scarf. When I took it out of the package it looked like just a piece of fabric, not a scarf.<br /><br /> I bought to use for an embroidery project and it was way to thin to embroider. It is see through as well.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,Wrong color wrong size All wrong always
1.0,"Well that was $17 wasted!  “One size” apparently means for newborns.  There is no way that anyone old enough to walk can wear this cap. The decoration is an iron-on and will crack if it is stretched. The 9 year old I bought this for will have to put it on one of her dolls!  Also, this took 20 days to arrive. You are not told this until after purchase and you cannot cancel the order. I tried to warn other customers but Amazon would not let me post a review earlier. Probably won’t post this one either."
1.0,"This shirt is see through and came with someone make up smeared on the collar, random hairs from whoever wore its, and stunk like their perfume. Absolutely disgusting."
1.0,"If this is an XL, I'll eat it.  I wear a size 10, but I have a 42DD top, so I ordered an XL.  The bottom would fit a Barbie Doll. The top is a medium, at best."
1.0,"The dress is not good quality. I purchased for a wedding, for my 2 year old and the flowers that are at the waist of the dress are hot glued together and connect to the dress with safety pins. The bow for the back of the dress is also connected with safety pins. Since this dress is for a child the flowers and bow should be sewn to the dress, that way you dont have a child being able to pull them off and poke themselves with a needle.The helm of the dress also has alot of loose threads."
1.0,These run very small. My husband has always worn a large and these did not fit at all.
1.0,These sneakers are so cute which is why I’m so disappointed that the fabric started detaching from the sole the first time she wore them.
1.0,2 of them fit.  The holes in the rest were to small. Could not get them clipped on.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Not pleased with raw edges had to seal wouldn't recommend
1.0,These are so cute but they have almost no stretch at all and would not even fit our 8 year old.
1.0,The zipper was very cheap and split apart at the slightest movement. Very disappointing because the robe fit nicely and was comfy.
1.0,tarnished first day
1.0,What a cheap piece of garbage!
1.0,"This top was the correct size, it just didn't fit well on my body. I bought other shirts this style and they were perfect"
1.0,"Worst purchase ever!  Followed directions to install and fell off within 30 minutes of using, won't stick on the phone.  Shows all fingerprints.  Also can't  put phone case on with the screen protector.  Do not buy!"
1.0,Sucks. Dress shrunk after first wash.
1.0,Wanted a tee shirt this is one of those shiny stretchy not very well made shirts and I ordered a much bigger size and it’s still too small
1.0,Charm fell off the necklace so I had to buy a new chain for the charm. I<br />think the product was overpriced I think I Spent $16 for it and it was really not worth the price I was disappointed in the product
1.0,"First, now sure how to bottom of the shoes look worn, but the rest of the shoe looks new. Next, if you are going to charge $10.94 more than the true price of the shoe, at least have the decency to remove the original price. I paid $27.81 for the shoes, but as you can see in the photo, the original price is $16.87. I know they charge what they’d like, but these may go back."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:49ffa118800d2ff54899f62e8612549e]] Unfortunately I was busy and never returned it so I’m either stuck with it or will trash it —- will definitely NEVER wear it—-
1.0,To small. Def not like the picture
1.0,Sizing not accurate!
1.0,i would have liked it if the snake wasnt sticking up in the air and layed flat on my neck
1.0,The dress fit tight. It seems like it's a youth dress. Beautiful dress but very short
1.0,These run small and are not comfortable at all.
1.0,doesn't suit my style
1.0,"Hmm idk why there is 5 good reviews lol. This is way too high up in the crotch to wear with normal jeans, you have to wear only high waisted things with this. It was hard to snap and when I bent over the zipper ripped. *eyeroll* returning."
1.0,First of all the color is beautiful it’s the coolest shade of blue ever the problem is they not only don’t fit my Holbrook XL They’re too small for my regular Holbrook
1.0,"cute, but the stars fell off pretty easily."
1.0,"This item was cheaply made, light weight material with seams showing on ruffles and I really wanted to like this dress!!! Unfortunately it did not look like the photo advertised!"
1.0,"The shirt was shorter then expected, to loose on the shoulder and not made of good material."
1.0,Too rigid. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,"THESE ARE REAL RABBITS FEET PEOPLE, THIS IS CRUEL AND DISGUSTING!!"
1.0,Cute but bill is half as long as the image
1.0,I was so exited to revive it this but the straps fall down to the point you can’t wear it. I have broad shoulders so I thought it would be fine but I can’t wear it out because you have to constantly pull it up and down.
1.0,No no no please just don't do it. I know I was getting a cheap tie but I didn't know it was a CHEAP tie! Lol shame on me
1.0,They are terrible
1.0,Huge... Definitely not for kids and to big for my face too. Unless you are a large adult male do not buy!
1.0,If youre looking for a halloween costume....look no further... the fur is very thin and sheds all over the place.... the fit is super small... the packages says 14/16 but that is false... i will be returning it asap
1.0,way to small cute though smaller the a dime can probaly use  as a charm for it  the picture show much larger would  be perfect for a charm braclet  my  intendent was  to use on a key chain but that  can not work according to the size of it  nice product otherwise
1.0,Trash. I wore them literally last night to a concert and they tore some easily and the rhinestones fell off one by one all night. So pissed
1.0,"I loved the shine of these, but the way the posts are, I am unable to get them through my ears!  I even had someone try and help me and they were as frustrated as I was.  I would return them, but I lost the packaging.<br />Very disappointed."
1.0,"The cup size MIGHT be a B on this joke of a bra - if you're generous with your descriptions. I didn't expect great quality for the price, but I did expect a ""big cup"" when that's the way it's promoted. The only thing big about this one is the whopper. I'll give it to my daughter. She's tiny. I hope it's big enough for her."
1.0,Ordered a woman's large and when it arrived it looked like a pair of pants sized for a small child.  I double checked the tag information and it indeed said woman's L.  Extremely dissapointed.
1.0,Poor zipper placement. Has NO stretch.<br />Im pretty small and I couldn’t get it over my hips. Imagine having to pee! NO THANK YOU.<br />Returning was going to cost more than it was worth. Unless you have no hips or are willing to size up and be baggy. Do not waste your time!!
1.0,I sent it back...not satisfied...the eyes are not diamonds...mine came with a black onxy type stone...and i didnt read fine print...its not real...18k gold plated..blah blah nlah...SO NAW...IM NOT SATISFIED  WITH IT.
1.0,It's nothing what it looks like In the pic quality very cheap
1.0,"Such a cute idea, only wish it wasn’t so top heavy.  Had to return bc won’t stay upright"
1.0,The idea of a pocket inside of a pair of suspension shorts is awesome. The idea of a pair of suspensions shorts being attached to a pair of gym shorts is just as awesome. Cutting corners on the manufacturing ? Not awesome at all. In fact it’s disappointing because it’s a very simple concept
1.0,"Awful quality, Do not buy. Color was way off and really cheap looking overall"
1.0,"Cheap looking , returning"
1.0,"Online this t-shirt looks so adorable. I liked it so much that I bought one in green and one in pink. However, I was really disappointed in them. The old saying you get what you pay for really came to mind. The material is awful and stiff. I tried washing them with fabric softener but the fabric was still awful. I did try to return them, but unfortunately I ran out of time. A friend of mine is collecting clothes for disabled veterans and I donated both shirts. Perhaps someone else might like them but not for me"
1.0,See through poorly made. I tried to return never heard back from anyone. I was over 30 days because I was so disgusted it was made so cheap!
1.0,I ordered my husband these and I always order at least a half size bigger these came in size 10 and they are way too small I should order a size 12 what a joke in the material feels like crap on them l. Don’t buy them trust me
1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE SHORTS!!! They absolutely suck!! They're not even denim they just made them look like they are!
1.0,Poor quality and very difficult to put on.
1.0,Realmente una estafa no es de plata es de acero no tiene nada que ver con la fotos son unos amorales
1.0,"cheap, thin and not worth it. I revieced it almost four weeks after I purchased it."
1.0,"Product had a strong off-gassing, chemical smell."
1.0,"I bought a similar version of this, which was a cheap plastic leather. I noticed the insignia of that wolf popping up all over the place so I did some digging,  Right away I found out that the insignia isn't &#34;antique&#34; in anyway shape or form... Its from a video game called &#34;Final Fantasy Advent Children&#34; I wonder if the people who are manufacturing this gets in trouble for copyright infringement."
1.0,"you can see through it, it covers nothing"
1.0,Didn't cut glare hardly at all. Waste of money. Sent it back.
1.0,"If I could give it less than a star I would. Do not buy this product!! It's very cute, but not surgical steel...I had a terrible allergic reaction. Would not recommend to anyone!"
1.0,Dress are cute but like 2 size smaller and I am so mad because we are having a photo shot in a few days
1.0,BULLCRAP
1.0,Very shabbily made it was dirty when it arrived and when i wanted to return they were very difficult
1.0,Asked to return and they wanted me to pay shipping.<br />It was way too large for me.
1.0,"The bottoms are not high cut or high waisted like they appear in the image. Strange fit, poor quality. Will be returning."
1.0,Purple color was very faint.  I have the turquoise and it was almost like buying the same dress.  No real color difference.  It was barely dyed purple.
1.0,Really chunky. I dont wear it
1.0,DID NOT FIT.  My 13 year old couldn’t wear these. They were definitely a boys size not men’s
1.0,I received 4 pack of shorts only one did to tear on first wash. The one pair actually fit the others fell apart and were too loose.
1.0,The material is actually really shiny and cheap.
1.0,No filter or even a place to put a filter!  $20 for a piece of cloth. Great customer service from Amazon for a credit.
1.0,I'm usually a large or medium in shirts. I decided to get a large but when I received this shirt it was way too small
1.0,"The material is awful. It's shiny, silky material more appropriate for an evening out than wearing to work. You can't tell this from any of the photos."
1.0,"Very disappointed that this bracelet started fading within a couple of weeks. It's not stainless steel, it never got wet, but didn't hold up. Not a good purchase"
1.0,The dress is lovely if it have not been too snug across the midriff I would have kept it.<br />I returned the dress.
1.0,I know what a 5x is that was not
1.0,"The claws are simply glued on to the finger tips of the gloves. They came off the first time I used them. I tried continually putting the claws back on but they keep popping off and now several of them are buried underneath one of my plants. The gloves are very flimsy too, I was pruning a rose bush and the thorns poke right through as if they weren't even there. Very disappointed in these gloves."
1.0,"Completely useless.  Made of some kind of rubber, soft plastic, with zero stretch I couldnt get it past my fingers, even if I could have, I would not wear it.  It feels like an accessory for baby dolls."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6d6d03367ddaabc0043b15a446639e69]] Looks nothing like the photos. It is flimsy. Cheap. And forget the spider web. It isn’t there. To top it all off-  I HABE TO PAY TO SEND THIS CRAP BACK!  I hope I just saved you money. DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,There were some areas that did not match the picture which made a big difference in the fit. I tried to return and it was sent back to me after I paid to have it sent via UPS because it was not covered by the seller.
1.0,"This ankle bracelet is the worst thing, I ever baught!!!! It was losing, pieces were falling off with-in hours, Never mind a day!! Big waste of money sucks!!!"
1.0,Dress is not true to size this  dress is for a very very slim person if you are a 6 order a 10.
1.0,Wore it less than one day and two of the stones fell out.  Piece of junk.  Don't waste your money
1.0,Its not fit with me... And I'm so sad to waste my money for that...
1.0,Robe was much to large. It needed to be ironed. I gave it to the Salvation Army as a donation
1.0,Total Junk!  Three of the clasps don't open.  Two broke.  The velvet chocker was so twisted that even an iron couldn't straighten it.  Junk.  Absolute dime store junk.
1.0,I DO NOT recommend this dress or this company. The dress was ordered in 2 sizes bigger than I needed and was extremely tight. It had such a horrible chemical smell I had to put it in the garage because it stunk up our bedroom. It clearly states free returns which isn’t the case. The company wants me to pay to return the dress. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. Huge mistake.
1.0,"Returned. Bust was very small, bottom barely covered my bottom and it's didn't fit around the waist at all. So it wasn't pictured well to be able to tell that the sides are bare and even cut in close to  the stomach , I was hoping to cover my stomach . This did seem like decent fabric but didn't fit and wasn't at all flattering in my opinion"
1.0,"I returned this, way to big."
1.0,The Size small was like a large and the material was not as expected and they strongly encourage ny to return which is unfair
1.0,"A bit difficult to use initially, but they did secure the case and made it easy to identify at baggage claim."
1.0,Size is not Accurate
1.0,"Horrible! I threw them out! The inside would come out onto my feet (synthetic material) not comfortable. The price was right but you get what you pay for, right?"
1.0,"Not mauve  as appeared. Flattering fit, but very purple."
1.0,They are stylish but not too comfortable.
1.0,Ear loops are not securely attached AT ALL. Fall apart before you even put them on. DON'T waste your money.
1.0,"Cheap, when i received them one of the rivets was missing completely.  The seam work on both the blue and pink is horrible, and both pairs were scuffed up. not worth the $$ at all"
1.0,The pockets were not sewn closed and the material was to plastic
1.0,"I ordered two of these discs and both are of very poor quality.  The metal is very thin on the patterned part of the discs, and one of the discs arrived so badly bent that it gives that area a rippled look.  The frame around the disc is also bent in one place.  The patterned part of the second disc is also bent in one place.  The chains have lobster claw clasps that are very difficult to use.<br /><br />This is the worst quality I have ever seen in stainless steel jewelry.  Do not waste your money on these."
1.0,Not sewn properly need to return item.
1.0,"I thought I would be smart and wash this before I used it on the trail.  Glad I did.  After the FIRST trip thru the washing machine it frayed BADLY along one entire side.  Very very tacky.  Needless to say, this won't be in MY backpack ever."
1.0,Material reminds me of a moomoo. The cut is not for ladies with boobs. My daughter (7) laughed and said I look like I'm ready for bed. Lol.
1.0,"Last year's tops were fabulous. Cool on hot days washed well, and retained the tunic length, soft against the skin. These were the ""perfect"" summer knit/tunic top. The tops were 95% cotton and 5% spandex.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I put a new top on; the top felt different. It was tighter and had more stretch. However, once outside, the fabric didn't breathe. It was hot. I thought washing the tops would soften and loosen them up. I was wrong. Although the label says the material of both years' tunic is the same, the material is very different. I am so disappointed in the new version. I would appreciate the vendor revisiting the composition of the new tunic. If I had known there was so much more spandex in the material would not have purchased them."
1.0,Don't let the pic fool you. One earring didn't even have a pearl on it when it arrived.
1.0,These must be from China but even my Chinese friends are not this small.  I do not understand how you can label a product sold in the U.S. as a Large when it looks like it is a XXXXS.  I laughed when I took it out of the bag.  Pretty ridiculous.  Thankful for amazon return policy.  Pretty bummed though because the fabric looks comfortable and I bet they would look amazing if they actually fit an adult.
1.0,cheap thin material
1.0,"First time they were worn, the knots that are used to hold them on, fell out!"
1.0,Very pretty and nice quality clothing. However thr sizing is very different than traditional sizes.
1.0,"... and once that happens, it's trashed. Three much nicer, sturdier shoehorns are product-linked below ...<br /><br />(1) [[ASIN:B000POHT2S 27"" Teak Shoe Horn]]<br /><br />(2) [[ASIN:B000KJT1HO 31"" Plastic Tortoise & Wood Shaft Shoe Horn]]<br /><br />(3) [[ASIN:B001AJ3B6A 21"" Rosewood (Stain) Shoe Horn]]<br /><br />I bought this worthless product around town for about 15 smackeroos ... and it sells here on Amaz under about a dozen different ""brand"" names. But the pictures make clear it is the exact same item. The shoehorn itself is physically unbranded, except for a stamp on the thin metal horn that says ""Japan."" (So I am posting this same review under the various brand names ... because I've owned one and they are all ... they are all ... the exact same thing, OK?)<br /><br />Anyway, it's junk, I am telling you not to buy it.<br /><br />Happy hunting."
1.0,the fit is too small It is not true to size
1.0,"Didn't love the fit, it is not fitted and looks cheap."
1.0,This item was not true to size.
1.0,Felt like a bait and switch- what I received was not what they took pictures of for the ad- shame on them for wasting my time
1.0,"Broke the second day they were worn. I realize they were inexpensive, but expected more than a day and a half"
1.0,"Edit- This company has sent me a dozen emails asking me to change my review, and offering free clothes or money in return. Do not trust the good reviews. I am changing my rating from two stars to one.<br /><br />This dress is adorable and lightweight and comfortable, but it is way too short. I am 5’3”, so not at all tall. Yet the bottom button doesn’t even reach my crotch. I am very disappointed because it really is adorable. It just isn’t functional."
1.0,The elastic band has no give or stretch to it and broke as soon as I went to tighten the skirt
1.0,I got this a week or so ago and just got around to putting it on.....the end peace fell off
1.0,Cheap clip
1.0,It was missing a screw so pretty much useless but then again it was a dollar I wouldn't buy again and risk it
1.0,"It does not look anything like the picture, took way too long to be delivered"
1.0,False advertising. These are not Grateful bears! Trying to return
1.0,It looks so great in pictures but it’s just awful when you actually see it
1.0,"way too big for me, giving away"
1.0,"I'm so disappointed:( I bought this because I based it on the first photo that they used to sell this mask.it is not the same as the one in the description.i was hoping for a hard mask not a plastic/rubber type! Considering what it costs,it's not worth it. It also smells like gas fumes.i don't think I can let my child wear this.so it's gonna get returned ASAP!"
1.0,"Incorrect colors with stretchy, flimsy material and poorly constructed.  It took almost 4 weeks to arrive so I will not deal with returning or exchanging."
1.0,Its very cheaply made. We have enough consumer pollution... didn't bother trying it on took back immediately
1.0,terrible socks slips off and did not even include the 6 pairs
1.0,way to big and very cheap looking
1.0,I used this maybe ten times before one of the spokes broke - and it wasn't ever windy.  Cheap
1.0,"Cheap materials, cheap product. Would not recommend."
1.0,Will be returning. Received with 2 kinks in the chain.
1.0,Too thin it's compmetly see through I had to buy a slip to be able to wear it
1.0,It was kind of deformed almost. It didnt fit right. It wasn't comfy and it runs small.
1.0,Pretty but not silver. I bought them last July and a month ago they tarnished and turn cooper color.
1.0,Do not buy
1.0,"This is the most comfortable pair of socks you'll find, BUT it does not last!  I own many pairs of these socks, and within a year, I wore a hole in every pair.  Because it costs so much, I have learned to darn the socks, but gosh for $14 a pair, you'd hope they last longer than that! :("
1.0,too hevy
1.0,I own a few of these live lucky hats. Disappointed these hats run 1/2 size to a full size smaller than other exact lucky live hats ?
1.0,Poor quality amity material.  Pulls easily. Frays easily.
1.0,The worst product I have every gotten from Amazon. These a suppose to be stacked pants but nothing about them is stacked. The literally scrunched up the side of regular poorly made sweat pants. Stacked pants a suppose to be extra long and these pants stop 4 inches above my ankles. I so upset I bought 2 smh .
1.0,"Another reviewer mentioned this but the dress is super small. Even using their size chart the dress didn’t even go below my crotch - I could use it as a tunic or long shirt with leggings. That is, IF I could actually tie it closed -  the strings to tie the wrap weren’t positioned correctly so that it’s not possible to actually tie closed. Finally the material was very, very thin. Will be returning."
1.0,Suction part doesn't work and totally useless. It wont suction on to any surface of my car. Definitely returning.
1.0,Couldn't believe how cheap and flimsy it looked.
1.0,I liked the material and the look and the length of this tunic a lot. But I carefully washed it in cold water (not by hand and with other items) and then hung it to dry and it shrunk. Very disappointed that it did that. It now accentuated my stomach too much to wear. Don't know if it is returnable at this point or not.
1.0,"Receive this product with a dead battery!!! Really, you would think if you pay for a product you would get a product that works. I would assume that's how this consumer thing is suppose to be....what a rip off!!!<br /><br />Part two: After receiving a second watch after the dead battery fiasco we gifted it to a family member. Only this time the whole face comes of the band and next their is knock off brand name under the watch face......Straight GARBAGE!! Do not buy this piece if crap."
1.0,Fits like a medium. Very disappointed
1.0,Way way way too small I wear a size 8/10 and ordered an XL because i have a booty and i couldn't even pull it up.
1.0,It’s loose on the chest and body
1.0,This item is totally described incorrectly. This does not fit a normal adult head. It is cheap rubber-like material and so uncomfortable. Returning immediately.
1.0,These are not clear they are lavender purple and too over priced
1.0,"There was no bowtie, only suspenders."
1.0,"The scale is WAY off, the nose is literally 3"" wide. This looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,"Its the diameter of a large dinner plate. I bought 50 pounds of play sand and it it wouldn't hold half.<br /><br />Update, it also broke. The ring tore free of the cheap fabric holding it in place, nearly put a hole in my ceiling when it did."
1.0,"way to small, but cute!"
1.0,Pretty but wayyyy small for xxl.  I got xxl even though im a large only and not a big girl and cant zip up
1.0,"Sizing is totally off. Top way too small, bottom way too large. Horrible material."
1.0,Rusted  Horrible quality
1.0,Horrible cut color cheep
1.0,"I didn't like these at all. I sized  up based upon some of the reviews, and should have sized down. HUGE"
1.0,"I did not expect these to last several years but only one month (about 20 outings)! They snapped on top near the bridge (right above the nose). Do not waste your money.<br /><br />A shame, I really liked the style and fit."
1.0,Insoles were very thin totally not worth it. Save your money and buy something else.
1.0,terrible
1.0,"It came completely different than the picture.. it was so short it looked like a crop top, only not on purpose. It looked like it had been shrunk 5 times too short. The bottom of the shirt barely made it to my abdomen. $40 for this? I'll take the time and return it. Don't order this item"
1.0,I don’t have it
1.0,They all broke within first use - super poor quality.
1.0,"Muy pequeño, parece xs"
1.0,cheap - broke in less than 5 min.  The closing mechanism did not work right and you had to push so hard to line it up just right to get it to snap closed that the handle broke off after just a few tries.  The metal pole in the middle was the cheapest part I have ever seen on an umbrella.
1.0,Received 2 left foot.
1.0,Tiny.  Would not even fit my neck.  Cheap looking too.
1.0,material is very thin.  I bought it to keep me warm and it certainly will not
1.0,We ordered these for our wedding because some of my groomsmen we helping with the food. We could not even get them on with out ripping them they and super thin and we did not even end up wearing them. Not worth the money stay away...
1.0,"Fabric is nice, but size indicated is not even remotely correct. Body of shirt fit, sleeves were half way up my arm. It looked ridiculous on me. How it ever got quality control is beyond me."
1.0,This skirt is a horrible rendition of what the skirt in the picture looks like. I purchased the original skirt and had a snag in it so when I saw this one I thought wow! And it’s cheaper! Wrong! This skirt is the cheapest and most horrible fabric I’ve ever seen. Do not waste your money
1.0,Horrible quality. Definitely not a “denim” jacket. More like very thin polyester with cheap sleeves sewed on. Complete inaccurate web description with false advertising. The color is NOT tan/brown leopard. It’s PURPLE. Do not buy.
1.0,Lenses pop out
1.0,It's so pretty but it feels so cheaply made and so fragile.
1.0,Nothing like what you see or described! Horrible!!!
1.0,"Poor quality.  One pair had a hole right out of the package, three of the pom poms already fell off and the stitching around the elastic has come halfway undone.  Bought these for my daughter for Xmas it's now the 27th she only wore three pair and each one has had an issue. Don't buy."
1.0,very dissatisfied with these... they look cute in the photo but are not what they appear.... the hinge will not stay closed and the stud that goes thru the ear is certainly not made for earlobe piercings as they are to large to go thru a normal earlobe piercing.... Will NOT order any other products from this company.... THEY ARECHEAP IN PRICE and the PRODUCT IS CHEAPLY MADE!!!!!!! Better products are sold in Dollar General Stores... Amazon should stop carrying these products!
1.0,"Amazon is being overrun with junk products from China, I wish Amazon had a section for US made product."
1.0,I ordered in May and needed it for July. I tried the dress on in July (should have done it sooner). The button broke off of the dress and it’s very thin and see through.
1.0,Shirt was big. Ordered small and was more of a cover up. Still cute but peach was pink
1.0,Top was ok bottoms so small maybe a 2<br />I’m a XL
1.0,I don’t like this meterial and I returned it 4 months ago and still didn’t get my refund back
1.0,"Terrible quality. No seams, just rough cuts, worn for 10 minutes, already busted flowers and completely frayed.  Can't wash or will be a mess in machine. Not worth the time spent hitting ""buy now""."
1.0,To thick and heavy for my needs.
1.0,Wouldn’t buy again. It broke extremely easily.
1.0,"Cheap, poorly made, thin, and awkward shaped, did not fit well. Broke easily."
1.0,This was too big for me & very bulky. I couldn't even get it through my nose which has been pierced for a good while now.
1.0,Within minutes of wearing the crystal pendant broke from the pentagram pendant.
1.0,These started fraying almost immediately on the eyelets of my Vasque boots.  The original laces lasted maybe 100 times longer.  I just laced the second pair of these and now need to order something better before they are done.  The cost savings is not worth the hassle.  At least they are comfortable to the touch when pulling them tight.
1.0,Jewels were put on backwards
1.0,"I was thinking this would fit a bit loose since I ordered a size bigger than my normal size. It was not. Very tight. And the so called cute bow tie down in the bottom front, wasn't like the picture as advertised. Was like flimsy shoe strings that were too long for the bow tie."
1.0,"This is NOT kid sized. It covered my child's entire face. Mom gets this one, I guess."
1.0,Was sub par it was ripped straight from the package and looked nothing like the advertisement
1.0,The color was not as  pictured on the website
1.0,"The strings were so short! They didn't even for on the kids heads! And they were brittle, not flexible , and broke or dug in to their chins of they could get them on. What a disappointing waste of money! These were for my son's 2nd Birthday party. No one could have hats, not pictures in hats. Such a shame."
1.0,Very cheap quality. A few are already broken.
1.0,Too small for grownup
1.0,I had ordered this dress previously and it fit perfect.  So I'm surprised that this one was way too small.
1.0,These earrings are awful! t The picture is pretty but the actual earrings are too big and gaudy. They were sent from China so I don't think<br />returning them is an option.
1.0,Lenses were not actually green. However since the price was cheap i am keeping them.
1.0,"I loved the case and the design of the glasses but they were way too big for me. I put them on and they would instantly start sliding off my face. The overall size of the lens part itself was really big, covered part of my forehead and cheeks. Would've loved them if they were smaller and actually fit."
1.0,"These are absolutely adorable earrings. I love them and gave a great review on them at first because they were girly, dainty, cute, and inexpensive!<br /><br />I've been wearing them for about a day and a half and one just broke. It snapped right where the wire connects to the flower. I was considering buying more, but now I probably won't since other colors seem to be pushing $20 and these didn't last very long. Definitely not durable materials. Completely disappointed. I wouldn't recommend purchasing these."
1.0,This fits like a child's shirt. Does not like vendors who don't like to give a full refund.
1.0,The gems themselves are beautiful. The color the arrangement was gorgeous. The only problem is I wore my bracket once and then the elastic started to fray. You can see pieces of it sticking up between the gems. Overall I love it
1.0,I used it for 2 weeks. i normally use sunglasses in weekend during game. I use it 3 time and it cracked.
1.0,"Pedí talla 4 años a 5 y el que me enviaron fue para una niña de 2 años que decepción el vestido hermoso pero no me gusto la equivocación aún así me lo voy a quedar y a regalar a mi otra sobrina de 2 años y comprare de nuevo, luego de usar el vestido perdida total mi sobrina jugando se le rompió todo el vestido este vestido es para una ocasión no vale la pena comprarlo"
1.0,Leg length Awesome...and that’s it.  Padding is horrible both design and quality.  Whoever design these must have used a mannequin and not an actual male.  The padding is in the WRONG place.  Not worth $15 a pair!
1.0,Terrible fabric.  Sending it back
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in the length of this &#34;long&#34; sweater.  I expected it to be at least 4&#34; longer to cover my backend.  I bought this to wear with leggings and there is not sufficient coverage for me to feel comfortable with that.<br /><br />Much apologies for posting a picture of my backend, but you will see what I mean."
1.0,cut very small ;(
1.0,Very cheap looking. In the package is probably where it will stay.
1.0,The material looked and felt so cheap. Your dresses never look like the picture
1.0,The 2nd bracelet burst as soon as I took it out of the box....not impressed
1.0,"1st of all I would've given these pants minus 4 stars. While the Harley pants came quickly, are very roomy, soft to the touch and to wear. I wore them to bed as one would do with pajama pants and woke up to the backside of both cheeks open, the sides where the crotch is wide open. Now mind you as I said these pants are large and very roomy. All the tears that I've mentioned are all in the  material that the pants are made of, for some reason the material itself just shreds with the slightest pull. Heart broken over the money I wasted, so Save Yourselves Don't Buy these!!! 😭"
1.0,Cheaply made.  The rubber pad that are supposed to protect the ear from the metal is off so it just pinches.  I bought these for my 6 year old and they hurt her ears.  We threw them in the trash.
1.0,"Item was wet, smelled of mildew and mold"
1.0,Couldnt wear.
1.0,"This top was awful! For one thing is is incredibly wide and loose, the hem is uneven and it is extremely short (much shorter than the picture). The under layer barely covers my strapless bra. The fabric and the straps are very thin and cheap feeling. I do not recommend this product to anyone, I feel like it is a crap shoot what kind of fit you are going to get."
1.0,"Bought my daughter the small, size chart said 40 inch bust so I figured it would be oversized by a lot. It's SO TINY AND SHORT! Like child size. Super upset and returning."
1.0,"Very stiff and uncomfortable to wear, it felt very bulky through the shoulders/ sleeves as well. Wouldn’t recommend"
1.0,"Not as pictured. Appears to be maxi, but it came to mid-calf on me and I'm only 5' 2"". Bulky material that doesn't seem to be the same as what is pictured. Overall just not a great product."
1.0,I am returning product as it’s had a  super small fit
1.0,"The handle is broken, cant take it out."
1.0,I have a 28in and it would not zip past the top. it was too small. returned it.
1.0,Didn't work right from the beginning. Adjusted them several times but they kept popping open within minutes.
1.0,This item was returned.  Runs extremely small.
1.0,Ripped the first time i put them on.
1.0,"Don’t waste your time, it’s cheap for a reason"
1.0,Disappointed I thought this was a cute be staggering it just is a simple cheap little stamp of a B looks like something you’d spend two dollars on.
1.0,"Item came quickly, but it was way smaller than was indicated. No return receipt so I could send back the item, so unfortunately I’m stuck with an item I cannot use."
1.0,Broke second time I wore them
1.0,Zipper broke first time it was worn
1.0,My sunglasses came in and my nose pieces were put on crooked so my glasses don’t sit correctly on my face. Highly disappointed especially since I can not exchange the glasses.
1.0,Not a happy camper....picture advertised not like actual product...poor quality
1.0,Disappointed Most of them were broke
1.0,This bag is super small in person. The biggest thing it can fit is a tv remote literally and it smells bad.
1.0,The material was not very good and the sleeves looked weird. I returned it.
1.0,"My wife loved them when she got them but, after two weeks, every single one broke on the left leg and could not be repaired."
1.0,"ugly... don't buy,came broken"
1.0,The chain was broke when it arrived.
1.0,No Compression at all!
1.0,Arrived today and the button is partially broken. See photo.  It will probably split after one cycle in the wash. So I had to return it. Otherwise it looks like it would have been a good one. It was soft and fit my pony tail. Disappointed I had to return it.
1.0,Not the color shown in the picture. I ordered the bright red. I received a copper looking red.
1.0,The colors in the dress are just as displayed. However the material  is very thin and the dress was really short on my 3 year old daughter. Also the entire back of the dress is out. In my personal opinion this dress is too revealing for a toddler.
1.0,they looked way better on the pics<br />bad purchase :(
1.0,"Picture, and description was deceiving. Led me to believe it had a headset that came with it."
1.0,Poor quality shirts. Not what I expected
1.0,Way too big.  Neither my daughter nor I could make them fit.  Waste of money.
1.0,Xl fits like a small
1.0,I only received 3 of the 4 necklaces!!!!!!
1.0,"Do not waste your money, it was cheap and the fastner did not even open... cant even wear it now."
1.0,If you have large breast don’t bother. I could barely get these over my nipples.
1.0,"Not what I expected more like leggings, did not fit right I normally wear a 18-20 or xxl and these were too small"
1.0,The cut of the top of the dress hits very odd. I was disappointed because the other reviews’ dresses looked totally different from what I received.
1.0,"Junk, stay away.<br /><br />Kit is extremely small.  Case measures only 7&#34;x4&#34; and is not leather as it appeared to be, a cheap vinyl.  Polish came in black and a neutral clear, no brown polish present.  Started to polish my first shoe with the neutral and immediately noticed it was a very poor quality polish.  Used the foam brush, and before I could get to my second shoe, the foam had torn and separated from the wood handle.  I then used the horsehair brush (which is not horsehair, but instead is a synthetic bristle) to remove the polish, and due to a cheap polish, left residue all over my shoes.  I threw the kit away, aside from the two small bristle brushes which may come in handy to clean a shoe or other household item, and will reorder another higher quality product.<br /><br />Waste of money and time.  Do it right, buy something of higher quality, like all things in life, you get what you pay for.  Then again, I didn't get even close to what I paid for on this junk.  You have been warned."
1.0,Hey I was so disappointed when I received this top knowing I ordered a large n got a small...... not wat do I do with it? It's way to tight.
1.0,They are very thin i have been wearing the blue one for 2 hours and the seam is already coming apart at the crotch and they do not fit at all tight.
1.0,"Discolored, very cheap."
1.0,"ClASP WILL NOT STAY SHUT, tracker fell out twice, I returned"
1.0,"The biggest dial did not work out of the box, I put all three dials at the same time hoping it would work but what happened was that after some time I realized that the largest one was not working and the other two were both showing a completely different minutes (even though I set all three to the same minute mark)"
1.0,"Nothing to like about this nightgown- material is scratchy and too thin. Seams are especially scratchy and irritating to my skin. The fabric has almost no resemblance to real flannel. This is a cheap, shoddy imitation of a Lanz nightgown. Don't no how they could get away with using the name. I have bought real Lanz nightgowns for many years, so I know that this isn't one.<br /><br />As I said, this is a cheap imitation. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1.0,"Lenses are larger than described and they feel very cheap. One of the arms doesn't open all the way. Returning, don't waste your money."
1.0,"I love watches, but I did not like this at all, missing parts, damaged and broken parts and lasted a long time coming"
1.0,Merrys are way better polarized glasses and sturdier
1.0,Can fast but your feet will get wet and be very cold
1.0,Did not fit. This bathing suit runs very small.
1.0,This is my second pair of these. The first pair was amazing. This one I mistakenly  ordered half size too big. They look like they are old shoes  rather than new. They actually look defective
1.0,fit okay I guess; the dress just seemed cheap & did not flatter my body at all.
1.0,Large is not a large.
1.0,The quality has declined especially with the quality of the fabric. Would not buy again
1.0,Took over a month to get these and I had no tracking number so I had no idea when they were going to come. They are super thin and the sizes are completely different. The haunted house one is huge! The ghost one had an open seam that I’ll have to sew up. The patterns are nice and the price is great but I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,This description and photo show a chiffon top. What I wanted was a chiffon top. What I received was a thick stretchy printed fabric boxy top. NOTHING LIKE DESCRIBED!!
1.0,Too small and stiff
1.0,"I disliked this product because after the first wash it ripped. So, not very happy with product."
1.0,Awful for $ broke within minutes.
1.0,"I did not realize this dress was coming from outside the US. It is a lovely dress but it did not fit. I contacted seller and they said they would refund me my money but needed me to give positive feedback.  I did,  thinking they were trying to do the right thing.  They did NOT. They refuse<br />\to refund my money.  They should not be allowed to sell on AMAZON"
1.0,Definitely was not stretchy at all.
1.0,I order the same size on line and this was way too small.
1.0,It doesn’t fit. Runs very small! Would like to exchange for 2 sizes bigger.
1.0,Straps not durable
1.0,Very cheap looking very cheap made very flimsy don’t like it at all
1.0,False product description. Very unhappy
1.0,These did not even fit over my ears and were worthless to me so I got a refund
1.0,"Edges after one, delicate wash, cold water, frayed and tired apart"
1.0,Way off size-wise. Sent it back.
1.0,"This product is cheap garbage. It looks great, but it’s zippers were so bad I was afraid to zip it back after unzipping it. The material it’s made out of is thinner than the 15$ Kids backpacks you buy at Walmart. I sent it back. On the positive, it came quickly and packaged securely, and the amazon return was quick and painless"
1.0,"Arrived broken, wrong color sent, totally cheap."
1.0,I'll just stick with bullet points:<br /><br />1) Great price - you get what you pay for.<br />2) Requested return upon shortly after delivery ..  felt cheap ... No response<br />3) Finish wears off<br />4) Link broke a few months after purchase ... almost had watch fall off<br /><br />Pretty much everything you need to know
1.0,"Worst product, For L size, near waist its too tight and remaing other places its very loose. No shape, shoulder side very loose."
1.0,love the blouse; however I did not receive it.  please refund to my acct.  thank you.
1.0,"Super hard to breath, rub your face raw, and won't stay up"
1.0,"I was just looking for  a casual seat golf style shirt and thought this would fit the bill.  Didn't come close.  First the fabric did not have much body to it and secondly the fit was nowhere near a medium.  When I tried it on the bottom of the shirt actually came down to my knees, no exaggeration.  It was like wearing a mini skirt.  Needless today I returned it the next day."
1.0,Don’t waste you time or money on this. The print was blurred on the dress.  Cheaply made.
1.0,I was to small don’t recommended want something big Waste of money
1.0,WAS RIPPED
1.0,"Absolutely no stars. I like the style of the hat but the quality is terrible. The seams on the top portion do not center up with the bill of the hat, therefore, makes the hat look crooked. And the Gator logo is not centered. Will not reccomend this product. This doesn’t deserve one star. Very disappointed."
1.0,Inside liner is plastic cloth.  It's quite heavy.
1.0,Pretty necklace but it broke soon after I put it on my daughters neck.
1.0,Runs fairly small
1.0,This dress came with a hole on the backside right where another “hole” goes. Was supposed to wear this in a wedding.
1.0,"The yellow lenses are NOT polarized so these glasses are NOT anti-glare, as claimed.  I got these for driving in rain with low light conditions when regular polarized sunglasses are too dark.  These are misrepresented as polarized in the online product description and also inscribed on the arm piece.  The small test card that's included looks no different with or without the yellow lenses.  With actual polarized sunglasses, the test card looks different (the image of cars appears).  The dark lenses are polarized and will be good for daytime, but I need polarized glasses for rain and night driving.  I bought these as a bundle of 2 pairs (yellow lenses and dark lenses), so I may have to return both pairs."
1.0,The watch does not keep proper time  !  Keeps losing many minutes.
1.0,"They are marketing this shirt to compete or be on par with a couple of those other big name brand shirts that accentuate the arms and chest but be loose around the belly for us dad/bod guys.  In reality this shirt is NOT fitted in that manner, and its a cheaper brand with the tag cut and a new brand name hot iron pressed in the back of the neck.  What a joke."
1.0,"Not my idea of a soft fabric for a kaftan.  Kind of stiff and felt like it had a coating on it.  Also, had a chemical odor."
1.0,I look for youth size and I received aman one way to big on me
1.0,I wear small but ordered the medium size based of other reviews. The shirt is huge! Its like a night gown. An extra small may have fit me better.
1.0,The 3XL fit like a Medium…returning:-(
1.0,Quite disappointed
1.0,Frame cracked in 3 days
1.0,Broke in less than a month of having it.
1.0,"Used once, broke once! Don't buy this!"
1.0,Do not buy it
1.0,I ordered this shoe in a size 6 and it was huge. More like a 7. And glitters everywhere.. Very Disappointing!!<br />The customer care representative I spoke to was not nice or helpful at all. Was more like I was bothering them rather than them trying to be helpful! I wouldn't recommend!
1.0,Material is scratchy and it doesn't have any stretch so it fits weird if it doesn't fit your measurements exactly.
1.0,"Fabric is soft, but not the right fabric for exercising or any activity.<br />Size runs larger than chart says."
1.0,I got the XL and it was like a child's sixe apparently.
1.0,The material is terrible
1.0,The seam was already torn upon arrival. I am normally a medium and the xl was still so tight.
1.0,This mask is unwearable. Bad purchase!
1.0,"I bought this to give to a friend for her birthday, and the chain broke within an hour. I was pretty upset."
1.0,"did not fit as expected. ordered my regular size (too small)returned first dress, ordered next size up, when that came, no tags and no label in dress. second dress was poorly made."
1.0,This is totally NOT wearable.  I put it on my face one time.  Tried to tie the strings around the back of my head to keep it on.  Just the very small amount of pressure from the two strings being tied - cracked it in half down the middle.  This is CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP.<br /><br />You CANNOT wear this - because it's so poorly made.<br /><br />Warning:  This is Cheap Crap (probably from China)
1.0,Runs way small! It costs more to return this bra than it was to buy it. Soooooo not worth it!
1.0,"...but I do in these and the way the fabric falls it highlights it awkwardly.  The fabric is more plasticy than I had anticipated and reminds me of my childhood Disney princess costume. Also, while the fabric and the elastic is true to size, the seam securing the two is not.  Super frustrating to have pants that might fit if you're just willing to let the seam snap and take your chances with how long they'll stay together.  And then when you take that chance, well, see the title."
1.0,This is very see thru and the material makes you sweat returning
1.0,"Product is thin, coarse material. Not soft or warm. Colors do not match original photo, would not have purchased if it was going to be a bright YELLOW"
1.0,wrong size i wanted the 38 mm not 42
1.0,watch would stop and have to tap the crysal to get the second hand to move: the wristband was the only good thing about the watch: very bad DO NOT buy
1.0,I could not even get these on no higher then right above my knees. I ordered an XL/XXL they were definitely a XS/SM. So either I got sent the wrong size or that's just how the sizes run. But it definitely wasn't worth it for me.
1.0,I didn't like that the ring broke before I could wear it.
1.0,To short from the arms
1.0,Terrible!!! Nothing like the description or pictures.
1.0,"Bought an XL that was too small over my arms, if I went a size up it would be too loose around my butt!! That was fine, some things fit and some don't. I saw a review that mentioned the white part under the top and I just shrugged it off but wow!! I am very dark skinned and the white area made it look SUPER unflattering.<br /><br />Obviously returning because it didn't fit but even if it had, that white area was a deal breaker!"
1.0,Sorry I purchased this item. I wasn't aware that it was plastic! The color is a weird rose gold.
1.0,Shipped quickly but were brighter gold then i could use..  Cute though
1.0,Definitely not 925 silver! Already turned finger green.
1.0,Both pockets had holes in it when I received the package
1.0,"YAZILIND Jewelry LTD, I had a lot of problems with them.  They use Tibetan silver which is harmful to humans.  Look it up."
1.0,Falls apart. Bad clasp. Made cheap. Do not buy this.
1.0,The fabric and colors did not match and didnt match the photo provided.
1.0,"Attractive, well-made glasses if you just want plain yellow lenses.  They are advertised as polarized but are not.  They even provided a Polarized tester but the glasses did not illuminate the test image.  Other polarized glasses I own vividly illuminated the image.  I bought these for fishing on cloudy days but w/o polarization they are worthless."
1.0,The polarized sunglasses were not dark enough. You could easily see your eyes.
1.0,I tested these to see how much blue light they block on the online blue blocker glasses tests.  It appears they did not block any bluelight<br /> &#34;blue light blocking glasses test&#34;<br />Google it.
1.0,Arrived broken  made very cheap !
1.0,It's runs really small but it's cute
1.0,"It was too big to be a woman's watch.  Too bright yellowish color and the clasp was so thin,  that applying any lressure on it,  gives you the feeling it might bend.  The face of the watch is heavy,  while the rest of it is hollow and so thin,  it feels uncomfortable.  Placed it in my drawer and we never wear it."
1.0,Horrible fit and fabric
1.0,"It's very thin, the leopard print is barely painted on, it is very poor quality. I bought it because it was made of cotton, but it feels synthetic."
1.0,Cute but hurt my nose. Whatever metal they have that sits in your nose was so uncomfortable. I returned them.
1.0,"Not what I was expecting, its not an actual ear cuff, its an eating. Because it is so heavy it does not stay up on your ear the way it is supposed to, and when it arrived my package was damaged and the stud for the earring was missing. Don't recommend to anybody, you could buy the same thing in a better quality for the same price at places like Claire's and hot topic."
1.0,Hard to put in.
1.0,Poorly constructed and glued together...No quality
1.0,I think this had was designed for Shrek because it's huge. Way too big I just threw it out after opening it. Waste of 5 bucks but oh well I guess.
1.0,Broke as soon as I went to wear them. Trying to get a refund.
1.0,Material is not cotton but a cheap thin stretchy material.
1.0,It broke after literally 3 seconds. I was so excited to give this to my brother for his birthday. Do not purchase this even as a gag gift. Cheaply made.
1.0,"I bought this back at the end of November and had to return it because it broke right out of the bag. After I got my replacement, it broke after a month. Now I can’t even got my money back 😒"
1.0,Eereyuck!!!
1.0,"So...this was cheap, and I didn't bother to pay attention to what it was made out of, but it was almost black when it arrived.  A dip in silver cleaner turned it to a yellowish silver.  Disappointing."
1.0,Bought this for my husband for Xmas.  Didn't even cover half of his ears.  He hates it :(
1.0,I bought a MEDIUM bc past reviews said it was small.  It was enormous and there are not returns so now I am stuck with purchasing a shirt that I can NEVER wear.
1.0,"Only good for ONE wear. I’ve purchased similar bras that lasted through multiple wears, but this one started peeling off within a couple of minutes into the second."
1.0,"5'7, 175 and the XXL was so small I couldnt get them past the knee.<br /><br />These appear to made for children.<br /><br />Also worth note, at least one pair of stockings came with a run, and no two pair appear related to each other.<br /><br />Two pair were brands, but not matching brands, one pair came in a clear plastic bag, and the 4th was in an unlabelled bag.<br /><br />Garter was high quality, metal snaps, etc, but was for MAYBE a 28 inch waste.<br /><br />Returned immediately."
1.0,Dress is cute but way too short! I am a size 12 and 5’3- as ordered an XL and it barely covers my butt!
1.0,"Dissatisfied in the way it feels, looks cheesie.  Not enough pockets"
1.0,"Too small, waste of time to order"
1.0,"Dislike, to small, cheap material"
1.0,Awful. Sleeves WAY too short. Material too thin.
1.0,"Cozy and comfy but the second time my husband wore it, the zipper slider came off the teeth. And the sweater is made well enough that it can’t slide back on at the top seam. So rather disappointed that a nice sweater my husband can wear for work, stay warm, look good in isn’t worth the money we spent."
1.0,Broke in 2 days
1.0,"Extremely SHEER. This coverup fits true to size, but it definitely is NOT the same product pictured- different material and cut."
1.0,"These are very pretty and so wish they worked. I ordered 4.00 strength. When the glasses came, they both had zero magnification. ZERO! I returned them, of course. I wrote to the vendor but heard nothing back. One thing that was really good is that my local Whole Foods takes returns and makes the whole process so easy. So I give that experience 5 stars."
1.0,"Was a gift for my girlfriend  and after three months of use, it had to change all the clock movement parts"
1.0,This shirt runs WAY small.  The fabric is printed.  It looks cute in the picture but up close it's cheap looking
1.0,Not as advertised..... doesn’t look like the pic
1.0,Size was not accurate and they were too small and pretty narrow.
1.0,"Not what I expected. The bottom of slipper has some kind of hard rubber, which makes it painful on my feet. Very disappointed."
1.0,I did not cate for these gloves.  They are poor quality. If i were to spend the money again I would purchase a better glove.  Didn't even wear them and just threw them away.
1.0,This is a cute shirt. What is silly is the fact that the tuxedo is printed on both the front and the back of the shirt so the kids are told continuously that their shirt was on backwards
1.0,"horrible quality, cheap material, poorly made"
1.0,Size was not true to advertise size way to small
1.0,"The logo is already falling off, I’ve worn it for 2 hours. Pretty sure it’s just super glued on there."
1.0,Didn’t use it sent back twice!
1.0,The pattern is  different than advertised and the hem and waist are crooked.
1.0,The leather felt fake. The label on the box had misspelled words.
1.0,Was not the item that was photographed in the picture. The sellers knew this and sent it anyway!
1.0,Cheaply made and bunches up. Dont waste your money.
1.0,Original Product received does not look like the item that is listed in amazon. This particular bandana or scarf was suppose to have been like colored yarn stacked upon each other. More of  a coiled look. Not happy with item will be returning item back soon.
1.0,Disappointing- the body of the jacket and length are true to size but the sleeves are nearly two sizes too small! Looks absolutely ridiculous!
1.0,"Not even close to being as advertised. Looks completely different, not even the same sweater. The color is a bright blue rather than a faded denim color. I was hoping to get that &#34;oversized&#34; look. It's too small to wear comfortably, and way too short, and I'm 5'4&#34;. I feel trapped in this thing. This could fit my 12 year old skinny brother. The sleeves don't even reach my wrists, even when unfolded. The hem barely comes down to the top of my jeans, exposing my belly button when I lift my arms, and I'm very short-waisted. Would never recommend buying this. The material is itchy, and it smells like plastic even after washing. Extremely dissatisfied."
1.0,The sole came off
1.0,"Fabric is not soft, the peplum flares a lot, so this is better for a thin framed girl verses a curvy girl.  I love peplums because they Always make my waist look small, but I look 10lbs heavier in this shirt.... and it came with a hole in it. Don’t buy."
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Material is super super cheap and crunchy. Not made for tall people. It looks like a “moo moo” or an old person nightgown in person.
1.0,Ordered package of 24 glow glasses and received 1 pair of glow glasses in a big box? Very disappointed.
1.0,hate the material and how it fit
1.0,"too small for the male human head, too small for the male human head.  It was made for small children"
1.0,The quality is very poor and the small fits way too large
1.0,I bought the 2XL from the suggested sizes from Amazon and it wouldn’t even meet across my front. More like an XS. Waste of money and the return process is too much of a hassle to deal with. I’ll see if I can find a very small friend for it. Plus fabric is cheap. It looks more like a cheap shower curtain. The pattern is printed on the material. It’s awful.
1.0,Disappointed! Material was a bad quality and the fit was not flattering I returned it
1.0,Cute outfit but over sized it looks like it would fit a 3 year old the pants are. Very long
1.0,Not at all as described or how picture looked.
1.0,"This watch band stretched out right away. It never stayed adjusted. It is not worth paying for it.  If it wasnt for the cost to send it back to get my money back, I'd send it back."
1.0,I received my wedding dress and I opened it and it is the most beautiful dress I'd ever seen except there was no ribbon to use on tieing up the back nor was there any other way to fasten the back up so I was not able to even try it on! 😔
1.0,This was a waste of money the pants came with two holes in them around the elastic band. The quality of the fabric is terrible and I doubt it makes it through but a couple of washes before it’s completely shrunk and torn apart
1.0,Ordered for my daughter for a party and it looked like lingerie it was so thin.
1.0,"Ordered a small light blue. I'm 5'5 & 115 lbs.<br />It's Very boxy lose & long. To long to try to tuck into pants. It over all looks slouchy!<br />The other disappointing area was around the back of neck and shoulders, the fabric sticks up. It doesn't lay on you smoothly.<br />The color is pretty true to picture and came nicely packaged but that does no good if you can't wear it.  If you wear a med normally, maybe try a small."
1.0,Hate them cheap
1.0,I would go up a size if you have large calfs and quads (legs in general). I got a large size (have a 34&#34; waist) and they were too small.
1.0,"Well, the description does say ""Khaki."" Was hoping it would be white or off-white, as shown. (I already have a high-quality tan sun hat.) Reason I can't keep is the quality. It is kind of limp, head (dome) part does fit, but is kind of short; flimsy overall. A chin loop is nice, but this one is cheap. Not worth the money at all."
1.0,Color faded off after 1 wash. Im left with a gray shirt instead of white.
1.0,Small and totally transparent. Returned.
1.0,The “metal” parts on this band is made of the cheapest quality material.  This is a return for me
1.0,Cheap spin-offs!
1.0,Too small!!!  I wear a large & read that it uns small but this was way too small!!
1.0,"I ordered an XL. The plastic package on outside says XL, the attached tag says XL, but the inside tag says M for medium. I'm not dealing with the hassle of a return so I gave them to my daughter."
1.0,I did receive a order but not exactly what I paid for<br />Because it was too light I didn’t want this one I wanted the dark mix with the light just as the picture showed
1.0,"I bought this dress in a small and it looks like a bed sheet. Way too large, not flattering at all, will not look anything like this picture."
1.0,Great purchase if your arms are two separate lengths. The left arm covers my hand but the right is like a 3/4 sleeve. And unless the model is wearing a 3X it's nowhere near that drapey in the front.
1.0,"This products is NOTHING like what is shown. It is polyester and some other fabric.. definitely not cotton. The small (which I normally wear) fit like a large maybe even an XL. Basically, I returned it immediately."
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap fabric.  Returned, not worth the money."
1.0,Don't bother with this one. Cheaply made and poor workmanship.
1.0,Returned. Arched is too high.
1.0,"I ordered a size a half size larger then I usually take. The foot part is fine, but the calf part is much too small."
1.0,Too small! I was surprised and disappointed how small these size 8 were! Had to return them all
1.0,"It should be titanium metal, hard to identify.<br />But the product is honest to mark stainless steal butterfly lock."
1.0,I returned it because the seams were off by several inches send none of the lines matched up.
1.0,I bought one size bigger than I normally wear. Because I like my jackets. Extra big and this one was still two sizes too small.
1.0,Not knee high as described.  Also do not appear to be really shaped as socks.  Not a quality item.  We returned them.
1.0,It looks as though it has been washed again and again.  Very poor quality.
1.0,ii bought just one to see if itll shrink.<br />Boy did it ever.<br />bought XL wash in cold water and dry on low<br />the shirt was perfect before washing but after just ONE wash tumble LOW it shrunk to a large<br />it went from below the belt to above the belt!!!<br />Dont recommend.
1.0,I bought Large and is like xs for kids. Material is nor good either
1.0,Its see through. Waste of money and time!  Very poor quality.
1.0,Literally hideous… look like a kite
1.0,The blue sucker was broken when I unwrapped it and the red light worked for about 3 minutes and then stopped working.<br />These were a bust
1.0,we ordered the flower print and got solid colors.  uncomfy and tight not flattering at all
1.0,Runs VERY small. Unless you super tiny hands do NOT buy these.
1.0,"The arms were too small, the dress looked like a potato sack. Sending it back ASAP."
1.0,"I had a women's summer straw hat with a wide brim that had lost it's stiffness and shape. Unfortunately, this made zero improvement and ended up being a total waste of money. Super disappointed and wish I could get my money back."
1.0,I'm not happy about it because I expect what I saw in the picture would be the same when I received it but I'm totally wrong. Wasting my time because I need to send this back to them.
1.0,"The sandal is not “that” orthopedic.. (weak arch).<br />And, the material used for the cloth portion is loose and gets a little sloppy after I’ve walked around for awhile.."
1.0,"I ordered a size up, it was still 2 sizes too small. The material is so thin that even when it's lying flat, you can see straight through it!!!"
1.0,Runs small and rides up
1.0,Product does not match as pic shown.
1.0,I regret buying it.
1.0,"The clip in the back broke right away, I started loosing it to try it on and SNAP!<br />Couldn’t even put it back together- slightly irritating because I loved the hat"
1.0,ice silk my ice since when is polyester silk of any kind
1.0,To small would fit small child silky made from non stretchy material uncomfortable. I really love dragon ball and wanted to go beast mode wearing this but i guess my new snot rag is cool
1.0,Exactly what we wanted but runs very dmall
1.0,"Broke before I could even get it on, very cute give it 1 star needs to have a much better chain"
1.0,"Totally dislike, still awaiting return label , can not close, missing  art of necklace"
1.0,"Not quit what I expected. No weight, looks extremely cheap (in color) and the material is crap. Will be returning this item (I'm too embarrassed to give it as a gift)."
1.0,Don't look like pizza at all. Look like yellow with red dots. No crusts so no clear picture.  Cheaply made.
1.0,I bought a size Medium and ended up receiving a size large. I ended up returning it. Would not buy again
1.0,I’m 5’11” and the dress fits but it is WAY too short. It comes up to the middle of my calves. The material isn’t very flattering either.
1.0,Very cheap and not soft at all.
1.0,This product shrunk 2 sizes after 1 wash and I had to return all of these for bad quality
1.0,"No, not for anyone other than... well no one... back to the drawing board on this one... I didn't even want to keep it and give it away...."
1.0,Ive had it one a week and its lost 2 gems already.  A waste of money.
1.0,Was not the color I thought but my daughter like<br />It
1.0,Very cheap looking. Wasn’t comfortable enough to keep.
1.0,Way smaller then ordered
1.0,not a truckers hat it is a low profile
1.0,Eyepiece broke off the first time I wore them!
1.0,This belt broke within 5 wears. The buckle snapped in half
1.0,The hat I received was a structured cheaper looking hat with a velcro back. Very disappointed.
1.0,It broke a week later
1.0,I just got these and a screw already fell out. Please send another pair. This is nuts. Other wise I liked them.
1.0,I threw it away.<br />I could have used it if it was shorter or a little longer
1.0,"The fit was strange (too long for me, and I’m 5’9”) and they didn’t fit like the picture.  The material is a shinier material than expected, and was very thin.  Returned."
1.0,"Came broken, in multiple spots.  Even if it was not broken, not even close to what is pictured in design.  VERY cheap material."
1.0,Not at all as pictured. So tiny fits a baby's ears.
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and the dress was still to small.  If you are shaped like a square  this dress may work for you. If you have hips and butt you might want to skip this dress or go up a few sizes
1.0,"L for Waist 40""-43""(Belt Length 50"")<br />Ordered and supposedly received the L size belts.  I could immediately tell they were too small when I tried them on.  I measured the belt length which was supposed to be 50"", but from tip to tip, the entire length of the belts was less than 46"".  I contacted customer service and was issued a refund.  I placed another order and experienced the same problem with the belts being shorter than the 50"" belt length as described on the website, as well as one of the belts not being the color ordered.<br /><br />For the price, the belts are a good buy, but not worth the time and trouble of having to return the belts due to inaccurate sizing."
1.0,"Doesn’t actually have to tie in the front. Ordered a large, usually I can wear a medium or large but like these baggy. I could barely get them over my hips (I have a bigger butt than most) and they are so tight on my thighs. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I was excited when I saw these shorts. The design looked attractive and they have good reviews.  However:<br />- The gel pad was extremely thick at the back with hardly any padding at the front.  I'm assuming these must have been ""designed"" by a man.<br />- The material of the shorts is so slippery you slide all over the seat.  This means you need to steady yourself with your arms so you don't slide off.<br />- Because the gel was so thick at the back it tips your hips forward, putting pressure directly where there is no padding.<br />In my previous pair of shorts I was able to ride 100 miles no problem.  With these shorts, because of their inadequacies, I could only manage half an hour.  When I got off the bike my lady bits were numb.  It's been over an hour now and I'm *still* feeling uncomfortable in that area.<br />I sincerely wish I could return these.  They are wholly inadequate for the job.  Take my advice, look for shorts with a foam pad.  Foam pads provide support and comfort without being so thick and bulky."
1.0,"The tail is extremely short as is the band attached to it, would fit a very small adult or a child. The bow tie band is extremely large and will have to be double banded or tied"
1.0,Does not look like pictures and time doesn't stay in screen
1.0,I bought these for me and my boyfriend. And his broke like 5 weeks after having them and neither of us would take them off one day it untied and broke.
1.0,Got these for my daughter because she complained her feet were hot. She wore them all of 2 days before the tongues ripped clean out of both shoes. VERY cheaply made! Buy something better and don’t waste your money!
1.0,It clearly says Men's watch but the box that it came in says child's watch and it does not fit the person I gifted it too. VERY BAD ADVERTISING!
1.0,I wear a XL but could not fit this. I wear a large but have large breast so ordered a size larger but could not get it over my shoulders.<br />Very tight on my legs. Not TRUE TO SIZE. Have to report.
1.0,Useless after a week.  Glue isn't strong enough.
1.0,My daughter bought this - she normally wears an adult size small but the sleeves on this thing are too short for her. Seller would not provide a refund either.
1.0,"When received my purchase, one item was missing."
1.0,Cute shirt. Wore it once. It shrank after one wash. Disappointing
1.0,Waist band is exposed straps too big.... Wish I would have read all the reviews first. Sigh little to late
1.0,The watch doesn’t work
1.0,Too small ! I ordered a size large ! Received a small !
1.0,"It fits like a plastic bag, and you can't iron the roadmap lines out because it will melt. Don't waste your money"
1.0,not so happy with it
1.0,"The item was delivered broken, I don’t want the same item. I would like to exchange for a different item in the same category."
1.0,"Poor made,poor quality  🖓"
1.0,Center plastic jewel popped off the first time I went to put it on.
1.0,Didn't like fabric so I didn't try on
1.0,Returning...wrong item...plus wrong size.
1.0,Horrible made was not worth buying
1.0,"Be aware that the first line with the material description is not for all the dresses. IT IS NOT COTTON 95%.<br />The chart is not accurate. The dress I had received is way too long, it is 2” lower than my knees. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I have purchased many rashguards and swimwear for both myself and my children from all different brands, but found Coolibar to be a good brand when others failed. (We’re a family of avid water sports participants). Up until this purchase, I was pleased with Coolibar products. Then I purchased this rashguard and was sooo disappointed with the quality. I compared it to one I’ve had for a couple years and this one looked like a cheap knock off. They changed the material, fit and even cheaped out on the gummy material used to hold the rashguard in place so it doesn’t creep up. I was asked by Coolibar to leave a review so I did and they refused to post it because it was negative. Then they said I could return it, but then reneged (after it was mailed). So now, the rashguard I paid for is off in limbo somewhere and the company refuses to help me by either returning the rashguard or issuing a refund.<br /><br />Even if you are a Coolibar fan, I would avoid their products like the plague for their AWFUL customer service alone."
1.0,"I have a whole bunch of these dresses. The solids are great. DO NOT GET THE FLORAL BOTTOM SOLID TOP. The fabric on the bottom is totally different. You can't dry it, it shrinks anyway and it's shorter than all the others I have in this style.<br /><br />I DO LIKE the solids. TTS"
1.0,"Don’t waste money on this Nike headband, buy generic. Swoosh came off with first wash and seller did not accept responsibility."
1.0,"Completely different shirt from pic. Horrible quality, like I don't even want to pay $13 for it. It's pretty damn bad. Plus it fits super poorly."
1.0,I spent a lot of money with this seller and not one piece of jewelry I bought is worth anything! Every piece is actually falling apart! I will never buy from this seller again. Money wasted!
1.0,"Looks so much better in the pictures. Way too wide, my daughter looked like she is wearing a curtain with sleeves. Returned it."
1.0,"This was so cute, but after washing and drying one time, the sweatshirt shrunk. I’ve never had this happen on any sweatsuit I’ve ever owned. I’m so disappointed, because now I can’t wear it anymore."
1.0,Material is strange and not flattering on my frame at all. Looks like a thick polyester sack.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in what I received.  It was not at all like the description, which clearly says 1 piece.  Instead, I received two, with a separate inscription on each.  I will not order from this company again."
1.0,"I bought these to see if they compared to the &#34;L&#34; leggings and sadly, they do not."
1.0,"I had the glasses for a week, since I purchased few other ones.  I put it on 2nd time and they fell apart the arm cracked off so there was not way to fix them........ Do not purchase, unless you want to wear them twice than throw them out."
1.0,"Junk!!! Inner liner wasn’t connected to the fingers! Every time my son took them off, the inner liner would come with it!!"
1.0,Purchased this product. No where does it indicate that it’s a used wallet. It arrived today with someone else’s credit card in it.
1.0,"Extremely see through , very short and poorly finished, went back the same day"
1.0,Don't like the quality. It is so thin and doesn't feel comfortable on my body.
1.0,Very flimsy. Cheap.
1.0,molding bar doesn't work. I've had many experiences with decorative grillz and this one is not worth it.
1.0,It is nothing like the picture and would say it false advertising. I ordered a 3t and received what seems to be the size of a 10 year old. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND BECAUSE IT IS SO CHEAPLY MADE!
1.0,"Compré dos, el negro vino bien, S, pero el lila vino M, le queda grande a mi esposa, como podríamos solucionar"
1.0,"“Red” long sleeve stripe top. Seller suggested ordering a size up. I’m 5‘3“ 135lbs and 34D  I ordered in an extra large instead of a large. The neckline fit very loose and sloppy, the bottom was to snug. The color is off not as pictured. Sleeves went past my fingertips, when hooked up with the strap it felt thick and bunchy. It was awful. Free Shipping and Free Return with my Prime membership was the only positive on this long sleeve top."
1.0,"Prongs sticking through the mailer. when opened the package, one prong completly broken off and the other one loose and bent. will be returning for refund. :("
1.0,This mask is not useable! It does not fit comfortably and presses into your eyes to where you cannot wear it.  Very painful. Do not buy. You will be wasting your money like I did.  Non refundable. Also I wouldn’t give this any stars but it made me put the one.
1.0,One of the stones fell out 1 hour after I put it on
1.0,"This bra is so cheaply made. Cups are fine buy rest of fabric is very cheap, for a plus size bra I need more support at sides and back."
1.0,By the time you get it window is closed for a return. So you are stuck with a tanished necklace.
1.0,the printed photo on it is not with a good quality and it seems like faded picture
1.0,"Ordered from this company and initially received the wrong color. Then, ordered this and is not as desirable in person. Looks cheap."
1.0,The white earrings have multiple what looks to be burn marks on the edges I cannot believe they were sent out to me in that condition
1.0,I will use the coat sweater for  office wear and also church.
1.0,Looks cheap. Fabric is awful and it's a printed on tie dye.
1.0,"looks nothing like the picture, looks like a piece of fabric with a elastic band. Returned!!!!!"
1.0,Do not buy if you are top heavy. There is absolutely no support
1.0,Color was different from the description
1.0,"They did not send the correct color. I ordered the navy blue (like in the photo) & I received powder blue. Its a cute bracelet,  but now I cant wear it with the outfit I purchased it to go with."
1.0,The picture is misleading. The nets are not made for an adult. They are too tight to be worn .
1.0,"Yes I loved it when I got it. Was able to wear it every day. One day at work, something fell to the floor. It was the bracelet. I was so angry! My situation was similar to the lady who stated hers broke too. Boo! Save yourself some grief and chump change. I would not buy it, Thought about ordering another one, Not no, but hell know."
1.0,I so upset I was so excited to get these they looked so pretty but when they came they diamond is just a strip of sticker and it's peeling and they smell like gas not happy at all. I advise you not to buy these they aren't what you think not like picture
1.0,Came in early but the actual charm didnt come just the choker
1.0,I am returning this- it is very flimsy and waaaay too small- I ordered an xx-large & it could fit a 8 year old.
1.0,Not as expected. Material is too thin
1.0,didnt last very long and turned green.
1.0,"Just did not like bra, and am return two bras,<br />Computer cord. The cord is wrong size."
1.0,Run too small<br />I ordered large is like size 16 but children’s
1.0,I ordered twice both time broke at the time I took it out
1.0,I got an entirely different  elephant mask than the one depicted. I wanted the one shown. I don’t like this one.<br />Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap and it broke.
1.0,"Very VERY cheaply made. The color is not bright at all , where it says &#34;forever friend your choice&#34; is rubbing off , the bow is scratched and dull. But ....... for the money I guess it's ok."
1.0,"Just because it's plus size, doesn't mean we all have jumbo sized breast. I should have listened to the other reviews because the straps were WAY too big, and wouldn't stay up.<br />My husband got a good laugh at it, but that's about it. The hat that came with it wouldn't stay up, and was bent.<br />Seriously, don't waste your money."
1.0,Infected my ear ugh
1.0,The shirt was too small and too tight. I made the mistake of choosing wrong size
1.0,Way larger than expected.  Bought this for a Halloween costume but not even suitable for that.
1.0,terrible product.  They are blurry and not clear to read through at all
1.0,"This strap lasted less than a year. It broke where the strap lock gets screwed into, and the guitar dropped when it gave out. Thank God I was able to grab it before it hit the ground. But this strap is pure junk.<br /><br />PS: I do 300+ gigs a year. I do this for a living. Just to say that I’m experienced."
1.0,"These appear to NOT be 3M N95 respirators.  Copies made by another company. They look the same but 3M  respirators have  3M and N95 printed on the front of the respirator.<br /><br />Another warning sign is this company has ""Dust Safety mask"" listed as use.  Get a real 3M N95 mask if you are looking for protection from bacterial and viral particulate matter. I don't know how these mask are allowed to have the 3M name in the description on this site !"
1.0,Runs really small. My suggestion would be to go a size or two up.
1.0,If you have just a little Cellulite IT will Show thru the pants. The material is this super stretchy leggings shiny material it does not keep your legs firm so you need great legs with no Cellulite for them to look good. Wanted to return since it said prime and I had to request it and never heard back from the seller. Way to go to lie about prime services.
1.0,"I have a long torso and it didn't even cover my boobs. I bought a Large and it was so damn tight, I could hardly get it on. The back is so cool but can't figure out how to properly put it on. does not fit"
1.0,"You can’t return these boots and Amazon won’t return them either! They run two sizes two small. Don’t buy from this store vendor, you will be out of 50$! Pretty upset amazon didn’t return these!"
1.0,This Product by VITEROU is not a pure copper Bracelet. Not worth the price.
1.0,These are probably the most unflattering pants I’ve worn. They are not tapered at the bottom like in the photo. They look like flared out pants from MC Hammers music video. These are straight from the 80s style. Very baggy and they look like parachute pants. I wear large so I got large and they fit perfectly on the waist and legs but the actual sewing job and design of the bottom parts make you look like you have the same size thickness of leg all around. It should be smaller at the bottom. Even rolling them up still looks poor. Ugly design and the material is too thick.
1.0,It looks cheap and the chain came very long (like extremely long) and has no clasps on the end so I can’t even wear it. Save your money even if it’s just a $1
1.0,Hole in it first day
1.0,It’s not the belt in the picture. The one I received is brown with a charm on it
1.0,Was a Christmas gift. Opened today and it broke in 5 mins. And now I’m unable to return or exchange cause it’s past the time.
1.0,"The strap broke after less than a month of wear. Very disappointed. Yes, it was a little over $5 but I thought it could make it through the summer. Needless to say, won't return to replace it. Looking elsewhere."
1.0,Almost love  everything about except for the toe post. The plastic is so hard and uncomfortable in between my toes. That hard plastic needs to be replaced by something gentle.
1.0,Child has autism and refuses to use!
1.0,"Dissapointed. My work changed their policy on piercings so I had to find something clear. I'm using this for my lip because I had it pierced with a hoop. I need something curved and flat on top, this shape is perfect . The length is perfect the ONLY ISSUE is that the little piece that goes on it falls off really easy and then my ring falls out and into my mouth making me almost eat it."
1.0,Disappointed in poor workmanship and quality control.<br /><br />The button holes on 5 out of 7 were sewn too small and couldn’t be buttoned. I had to modify the holes so l could use the buttons
1.0,There is NO WAY that this bra is a 38DD. More like a 32B. Very disappointed
1.0,Thumbs down. Not very comfortable. Left a mark on my shin that lasted a week. Wasted money on two pairs. :(
1.0,"This fit perfectly and I loved it but unlike all the other shirts I have ordered through this company this one was 100% cotton, which is great right? Wrong! The material felt not soft like regular cotton but dry? Old? It ripped as easily as material that’s been sitting in the sun for 5 years and dry rotted through. It was the weirdest thing. Of course this was my favorite shirt and I’d like to try ordered it again and return this hopefully fluke of a product but now it it twice the price at $10 dollars so I think it’s going to have to be just a return. I’m going to have to advise against this one. Allegra k seems to do better with their long sleeve shirts for some reason. The grey striped shirt material is soft and stretchy but the black is crunchy and rippy"
1.0,This is NOT an xtra large the sizes are for petite so be careful.
1.0,They were see through and they looked like a diaper.
1.0,WAYY TOO BIG
1.0,They are cute but fell apart in the wash after the first wash.
1.0,There were awful. So uncomfortable and shredded after the first use. I would recommend never buying these.
1.0,This is not as flattering as the pic makes you think. Somethings a bit off with it. It doesn't sit right on the chest to look flattering!
1.0,"I was so excited for this wine floral dress.  It is beautiful, but sadly not for curvy girls.  Too tight in the chest and hips, too loose in the waist, and simply doesn't hang right.  Very unflattering for women with curves."
1.0,"Sending this back,as it doesn't fit properly ontop of the jewelry vault"
1.0,"These broke after only a few days - the elephant broke free from the base. I emailed the company asking for advice on how to fix, and they didn't even acknowledge my problem, just pushed me off onto Amazon. I just want to know how best to fix them."
1.0,It arrives with a hole in it and was difficult to put on. I assumed from the picture it was a sleeve and not a cape.
1.0,Will not purchase again
1.0,It says &#34;men's xl&#34; they must mean &#34;anorexic pygmy xl&#34;
1.0,This is a scam of a shop. It's crap and from China. I ordered an extra large and it came large but Chinese size large which is really a medium. And it is short like a crop top!!
1.0,"the watch was not working, it could be damage during packaging, because when I received and i take out from the box, it's totaly stop and no moves that indicated from the mechines."
1.0,The post is on the rim instead of middle so it droops down.
1.0,"Do not order, size is only 6x4 and the advertised size is 10.6x10.3, such a misrepresentation."
1.0,Ordered 00gauge which I’ve worn since 2006 and they were tiny! I’d size up 1 or 2 so they look right/stay in your ear :(
1.0,This is a super thin bag and fell apart after only a few days. We had only used it to put my daughters birthday present and card in. The items were not heavy as they were crayola wonder markers and a few coloring books.
1.0,I ordered for red. And its not even red when i got it. Its like orange or brown. Like beans. I was expecting it would look like wine at least
1.0,It doesn't stay up on face when used as a mask
1.0,The 4XL does not fit my husband fits me and I am a 2XL
1.0,"Absolutely nothing like the pic! Cheap and small and not comfortable! What a scam. It's awful. I'm returning it, thank god for prime."
1.0,"I just got these today. Pretty packaging and I opened the box and it was BEAUTIFUL!!! I put the necklace on, perfect!!! Tried to put the earrings in and the gauges were too big. So sad. I assumed they would fit ears pierced with guns. I was mistaken. I have to return them :("
1.0,"Brought the same belt in black, same size and its like 3 inches shorter. Doent make sense."
1.0,the material was poor and the toe holes were horribly crafted.  i threw them away after just a few wears.
1.0,Bought and was broken upon receipt. Very cheap metal the other broke when I made it into a bracelet for my granddaughter.
1.0,These do not make any difference in seeing a golf ball.
1.0,"This is the worst swimsuit I have ever purchased! The sizing is so weird, the bottom is too tight and the top is waaaay to loose! My girls fall out from the sides 😐 Do not bother with this!"
1.0,"Poor quality, cheaply made. Very disappointed."
1.0,And it comes from china and takes for ever to get here not worth the money very very thin
1.0,"Cheap cheap and cheap!! Item it's a CHEAP imitation of the picture.. Do not expect to get what's actually in the picture NOT!! But for the price it's good. But then again, not what I order.. Disappointing"
1.0,"Would have rated this a zero,  but it came on time.  Cheap, Cheap."
1.0,Item runs BIG and does NOT look like pic
1.0,They WERE so cute when they arrived… but one was missing the needle for the pin. One fell off the pin while it’s first use. Another one came apart and now the filling is going out. We waited almost 4 weeks and I have no energy to return them!!
1.0,The price was too good to be true. The straps cannot be physically adjusted even though they are meant to be. I also received a used and tarnished one. Returned.
1.0,Is not of good material. Can't be use for handbag. Not the same look as on picture
1.0,"** UPDATED REVIEW: I have many pairs of these pants from 90 Degrees (all ordered from the 90 Degrees store on Amazon) and re-ordered 2 pairs last week (black and maroon). The pants I received were KNOCK OFFS SHIPPED FROM CHINA! (See pictures attached). They came in random Korean packaging, the maroon leggins were bright red, and they had &#34;medium&#34; labels, but were clearly XS-XXS. I turned the back inside out to show that they don't have the &#34;90 Degree by Reflex&#34; logo screen printed on it as well. FAKE FAKE FAKE. I'm so disappointed, I've never had a problem ordering from them until now. 90 Degree by Reflex refused to acknowledge their responsibility, so I had to settle this dispute with Amazon. Disappointed in their customer service.<br /><br />I've tried so many brands of athletic pants, from Ross all the way to Nike, and these have definitely been my favorite in terms of durability, material and price. They're super comfortable, and not see through at all. I have thicker calves than the average girl and have always struggled to find capri pants that won't rise up to my knees once I start moving, and these leggings definitely rest perfectly mid-calf during my workouts. Shipping also was MUCH faster than expected, so that was a big bonus. I'll definitely be re-ordering in as many colors as I can :)"
1.0,Returned.  Item is too expensive to pair with already expensive shoes.  New Golf Shoes shoes are cheaper.
1.0,"Hard to say whether these are good socks. I had to ruin two of the three pair because the plastic anchor-ties were so deeply embedded in the stretch material they could not be removed without damaging the clothing. Total waste of money! And the one undamaged pair is too small. Like child-size small. I wear a size 7 shoe, and these are stupidly tight."
1.0,Did NOT FIT any adult- - too small. I had to cut band and add flower so I could wear to derby party.  Should have<br />Returned it but didn’t order early and needed hat next day...so I cut it.
1.0,"Does not have the true color of amethyst, more white stone."
1.0,"I ordered a mint green animal crossing band. After receiving the incorrect item and sending it back to be replaced, the replacement still was not the correct color. The band isn’t very flexible and I feel like it’s short for being a 38/40 mm band. One of the buckle holes isn’t punched out either."
1.0,This top is poorly made. I tried to return it but can’t get anyone to respond😕
1.0,"Should have listened to the reviews but my daughter is small, A cup, and I got a large because of the reviews, but the top was still too small. The bottom part fit perfect. Was so dissappointed."
1.0,This dress runs small and the material is see thru in a cheap way.
1.0,I have not received the order as of yet however I am disappointed already.One Until I contacted in blue because I hadn't received a tracking no.and Two their response was cavalier and Three I will not get what I ordered for close to 25 days is absolutely ridiculous.unbelievable.
1.0,"I like the design? Colors? But, doesn't fit right!"
1.0,"The neck hole does not stretch and is extremely difficult to fit over your head. Once I forced it on, it ripped around the neck. Unfortunate because once on, the rest of the dress fit well."
1.0,"I don’t know what alien hand they used to create the pattern for these gloves, but they don’t feel like they were made for a human. thunb too short, index and middle fingers too long. Thumb to tight, rest of the fingers too loose. I returned."
1.0,Very cheap material. I returned the item after opening it and trying it on.
1.0,EVERYTHING TO DISLIKE!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! SHOULD GET REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,I couldn’t even get this shirt over my head. Very disappointed- returned for refund.
1.0,"At 5'8&#34; these are too taut for even my longest shirts. They do stretch a long ways, but I would prefer not to stretch out my shirts. The elastic doesn't grab hair, which is nice, but I wouldn't call the material irritation free or &#34;ultra soft.&#34; Also the stitching started coming undone immediately.  I can not recommend these."
1.0,They are beautiful but broke 1 St time
1.0,It left a rash on my neck
1.0,"looks and feels so cheap, not happy."
1.0,This was not quite right the sleeves are too big and it doesn't hang right.
1.0,"Got a broken chain, also quality doesn't justify the price"
1.0,Way smaller then expected :(
1.0,Cute bracelet but the &#34;y&#34; in story is half gone. A little disappointed bc I loved the looks of this bracelet online.
1.0,"Very cheap, shiny material. Doesn't lay at all like pictured. Not flatering at all."
1.0,I have many micro dermal tops. Never usually have a problem with them but after 5 mins of having it screwed in it was gone. I did notice when I got it the threading looked weird. Maybe I just got a defective one. I will be contacting amazon.
1.0,not true to size had to return twice even after ordering another larger size.
1.0,The image is completely skewed. The material is cheap. What an epic waste if money.
1.0,"Much too small, would not even meet to close.  Very disappointed, because it's a beautiful robe."
1.0,"I got this to use as a silent alarm, so I wouldn’t wake my partner when I need to get up. Problem is, it’s not really silent. Even in “zap only” or “vibrate only” modes, it makes a loud, climbing pitch noise until you turn the alarm off. Also, half the features on the app didn’t work, and several of the features on the watch (such as the double tap button to adjust shock intensity) didn’t work. A real let-down."
1.0,Cheap and trash save your money broke the first time I used it
1.0,Dress is incredibly long. I am 5'5 and unable to wear it due to length. Size is closer to a 2 X than a 4X but fabric does give.
1.0,It broke off
1.0,Tiniest pair of earrings
1.0,I can't imagine an adult size 12-14 fitting into these.  I'm a 10 and could barely get them on.
1.0,Not as described. Item is not 22G and ringstuds are much much bigger then pictured. I can’t use these. L hook is too long and is visible inside nostril when worn.
1.0,The shirt looks horrible and super thin.
1.0,"The price is cheap, yes.<br />The size runs small, but follows the posted size chart pretty closely.<br />But if it doesn't look like the picture, what's the point?<br />It's a dull green like looks like it's already been washed a dozen times. The pleats show in the picture are so deceiving, there's not at all the volume that shows, just a straight A-line. Don't waste your time or money on this one..."
1.0,"These leggings are for a tiny, slim, petite person. I ordered a large. The waist stretches to 28 inches and the legs, below the knee stretch to a tight 8 inches. I did not try on, it is evident that the item would not stretch to fit. I am donating rather than returning."
1.0,It broke after two weeks of having it. Paint fades very fast.
1.0,I ordered a 2x bc I like a looser waistband. The waist band on these was the same size as my size 28 jeans. When I tried to return them they got lost and there's nothing they can do.
1.0,One of the earrings was broken the hoop part in the back of the earring was broken it attached the door knocker part.<br />For 6.99 wasn’t worth returning.  Got a couple of good earring backs for other earring.  Wanted you to be aware.
1.0,It was not true to the size it didn't fit in fact my 13yr old who's a size 7 couldn't where it waste of money
1.0,"Product is very thin and feels cheap. I realize the price is low, but from previous comments i expected better quality."
1.0,"Item was received broken, the pearl was out from bracelets. I had order 2 and both arrived broken. I returned them about 2 months ago and my redound for 1 is still pending. 😒"
1.0,Not even close to dress pictures has button on front and ruffle sleeves very disappointed
1.0,It broke as soon as I opened it! So much for this birthday present.
1.0,The Nose Gaurd Broke Of
1.0,too small for a small
1.0,"These fell apart after my daughter wore them for a week. Not only did one sole break off completely, but the other sole was coming loose. Glitter was also missing all over. They were so bad they could not be repaired and I had to throw them away."
1.0,Fell off the first hour i wore them lost a very expenive earing from my decesed grandma . I am heartbroken !
1.0,They don't really look like the picture.
1.0,Glasses were small they were more like a child’s size
1.0,Made for children
1.0,Way to short/small and I bought a size above.
1.0,It claims you can fit an iPad you can’t even fit an iPad mini in it
1.0,Material was very sheer
1.0,"The description says size may vary which is to be expected with any natural type stone, but the size was way off, and not in proportion to the silver accents, and the stone was very poor quality.  Do not recommend."
1.0,You can’t tell it’s dolly unless you focus
1.0,Color drained in one season.
1.0,"I have ordered this shirt FOUR times in a Small. The shirt arrives with a ""Small"" label on the package, but the shirt is labeled ""Medium,""  and is sized as a medium. No amount of feedback makes any difference. Do not order this product if you expect to get the actual size you order."
1.0,Not good too short
1.0,Made in China junk
1.0,"Well this broke within a month and I’d only won’t it once... what a waste of money. And it was exactly the thin thing that goes into your ear that broke off, so impossible to fix. Don’t bother"
1.0,"No, order size 1xl  package said XL  in fact it was a size 4 to 6 ."
1.0,This generally a good product and a fair value but not if I can’t use them.
1.0,Not worth a penny!
1.0,"Picture is not accurate. Expected pro-America colors. Got Chargers blue with a pro-diversity red. I'm not afraid of a color, but this won't go with 4th of July or USA stuff. Lame."
1.0,These are so cheaply made. They literally rip so quickly. I have to put two pairs on and even if I put two pairs on they will rip.
1.0,Disappointed in the material quality.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, unable to even read the wording on the socks. Very disappointed!"
1.0,The hat was packaged in a bag and shipping in a soft mailer. When it arrived it was wrinkled and creased. If it weren’t in this condition I would have still returned it. The hat was of poor quality. The red cord above the bill on the front of the hat was hot glued on with the glue showing and it was crooked at that. The lettering on the hat was also starting to peel off. One of the worst hats that I have ever seen.
1.0,Yes.. The buckle is the color of a brass. It looks like my grandmother's old belt. Ugh... I returned it asap. I gave it a star because of the pretty blue pleather. Nothing else.
1.0,complete crap - fell apart just taking it out of the package. everything became unglued and the two headbands were glued together
1.0,The fabric of this dress is scratchy and it is extremely loose. It looks like medical scrubs. Would not recommend.
1.0,Completely see through!! Returned.
1.0,I WEAR PERSCRIPTION EYEGLASSES.  THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT THESE OVERGLASSES. THESE ARE SMALLER THAN ANY OF THE GLASSES I HAVE EVER WORN.
1.0,Shirt will not stand up to washing/drying. Dry clean only T shirt? Better options out there
1.0,I bought these in February. It is now beginning of may they are falling apart. Inside soles came out within a month and now the stretch laces are broken. They frayed and popped. Won’t be buying these again. I was hoping they would last just till summer break but no they did not.
1.0,It broke within 2 days. Not Recommended to buy
1.0,Color is gold and not yellow
1.0,"Way way small and very very short in torso.  The leg cuts actually come up wayyy above hips.  If I were to wear this with jean shorts, the leg cuts would be above waist band of shorts.  I can't even wear this"
1.0,Every once in a while you buy something that's just not worth it......
1.0,Too big so they were annoying.
1.0,Terrible quality and look!

1.0,Very stiff and no way to pull them on
1.0,I wore The necklace and within 3 hours the necklace broke :(

1.0,They always slide down.  I do not recommend
1.0,The fabric on the dressed I received is a low level polyester. It looks and feels gross and cheap.
1.0,Doesn't stay on head at all.
1.0,Do not order these shoes!  These shoes are so cheap and poorly made. What a disappointment!  They run a size small!
1.0,Waaaayyyy to small.. Not true to size😞
1.0,I wanted to love this bathing suit but the sizing is not true to size. I ordered a Medium and the top was cute but the bottom was absolutely dreadful. The rouched fabric looked terrible and bulky and it was HUGE on me and I am bottom heavy. Just received it and already initiated a rerurn.
1.0,Runs very small. Couldn’t wear it at all
1.0,"Like them, would have been nice if they got to our house"
1.0,"hated the dress, the top was huge while the bottom fit."
1.0,They break so easily!! I got them yesterday and two of them broke already
1.0,"This is poorly designed.  the neck opening is tight on my normal sized neck and the pillow is so fully stuffed as to not adjust to pressure, making it uncomfortable in any position for any use.  I am returning it and do not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:88d57eab25b402da1de60239684b026c]] It fits well but the seam ripped first day while adjusting it....
1.0,The necklace was not what was shown or advertised. The discoloration was horrible and not mentioned.
1.0,A themed party
1.0,Not cute
1.0,Dissapointed in this piece. O ring not soldered to bead. Lost initial. Luckly my sister found it in the carpet. It probably would have been vacuumed up. Don't know if I will order any more from this company. Now it will cost me extra to have the O ring soldered.
1.0,Torn material when received and was stained. Hair and was bent and wadded up where we could not use it. Very disappointed
1.0,the zipper on the one i received did not work -- Amazon did readily refund upon return within one week
1.0,"Some of the rings are cute but most were poorly made, gems glued on crooked etc. Some don't fit at all. Worth it for the price however."
1.0,Did not like the feel or the fabric. Too rough<br />Too stiff
1.0,Hated the cheap material.
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Soles of the slippers started to fall off within 2 days.  Very disappointed in the quality of them because they were comfortable.
1.0,"The belt is made of two layers of leather glued together. But the two layers started to separate from each other after a few months, and several more months later, two layers are almost totally separated.  Other than that, I liked everything else about this belt."
1.0,It was to small for my wife so I sent it back
1.0,Size does not fit US sizes!!  At least two sizes too small!!
1.0,"I loved this dress at first! Well, I washed it, hung dry it and it shrunk inches. Now I am very disappointed because I can't wear it anymore and I can't get my money back. Don't buy one!"
1.0,"There is just a tiny patch that heats and gets too hot right on back of hand.  Rest of glove is unheated, just a normal fingerless glove."
1.0,Its not good quality. After one use it was pretty much over for the skirt.
1.0,"We ordered these for the soccer, cupcake, basketball, peace signs and puppies, and received NONE of those.  We got the most common repeats, suns, multicolored flowers and butterflies.  My daughter is making silicone bracelets with charms and needed some for kiddos with different interests, and the picture fits the bill, but it was a wasted $10."
1.0,Dress was nothing as described and ran way small.  Was very unhappy with this
1.0,This band does not fit watch well. Doesn't have enough lip to stay in place. Watch fell off in mud water...threw the band away!
1.0,Don't like it all.
1.0,"cheap, very cheaply made.  I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,LOW Quality - looks great - breaks down after 1 month !!!
1.0,It broke right after I unzipped it. Not good quality.
1.0,This one is pretty and seems better made than its silver counter-part but it arrived with its post so badly bent I can't wear it and don't dare try to straighten it
1.0,Stone looks like a dirty piece of glass NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE
1.0,Didn’t care for the fit straps too long
1.0,It looks like picture quite beautiful...but it was broken when I received it.  I contacted seller...no response.  Dont let this deter you as I said its lovely...mine being broke could have been a fluke.
1.0,Cute BUT SUPER TINY!
1.0,This jacket is not waterproof. It can't withstand light rain. Only gave it one star because no stars was not an option.
1.0,"They are VERY HARD and hurt my feet, also very tight. NOT true to size, you'll need a size up IF you're willing to deal with stepping on legos practically."
1.0,They were super small on my face. Ended up returning product
1.0,This item does not work at all  i tried to put 15 dollars  in it and the money slide out  do not buy this item you will regret it
1.0,Didn’t like it at all!
1.0,"I dropped this item off for return at the UPS store on 4/30 and have the receipt, but my account does not show that. Please track this and credit me for the return. Thank you.<br /><br />BTW, I am returning this bag because the  clasps are too tight and I cannot open the bag."
1.0,These shorts started ripping at the seams two months after I bought them. Today I realized I was walking down the streets of a major city with my bottom sticking out of a giant rip in the backside. My recommendation is that this company be liquidated and the proceeds be given to charity.
1.0,Trying to find the perfect size according to the chart was impossible. Cute suit just not a cute fit.
1.0,cheap google one lay face foam
1.0,Definitely not genuine leather.  Not what it appears.  The item I received had a white thread top stitch and not red as shown in the picture.  I will be definitely returning this item.  I will just save up or set up a gofundme account for the real hermes band.
1.0,broked. day one.
1.0,If you have 3 keys or less than this will work for you.  This came in a 2 pack and the extension screws did not fit for either set.  They only screwed half way in and crooked.  The rest of the key chain looks nice but the screws are poor quality.
1.0,Very thin material and poor fit for someone with hips.
1.0,Bad quality as cheap as price.
1.0,Dress will turn pilly after a wash or two. Super cheap and not worth the frugal price. I wanted to return after I saw how it got but the Amazon return window was closed.
1.0,They rip the second day I waste my money
1.0,"Definitely not what I was expecting.  Loose fitting, not attractive.  But the materials are nice and I appreciate Amazon trying to deliver a custom product at a mass price.  unfortunately the algorithm or what ever they use to manufacture these shirts is not ready for prime time."
1.0,"Heavy material, brim too shallow to do much, cheaply made"
1.0,Junk don’t waste money
1.0,Material is lousy runs really big.. returned it. You gotta iron this . Washing a nightmare I bet
1.0,I am unsure of how it fit. I did not even take it out of the package. The color was all wrong. As soon as I opened the package I new it was a return. I am sure the material was decent. However the dusky blue color was not flattering. I should have ordered the white
1.0,"These are most definitely for children. They are tiny! I just got them today, and will be sending them right back on Monday."
1.0,The sizes are not as advertised. They are extremely small and honestly meant only for petite skinny people. I bought an XL size and what I received instead was a costume small enough to fit a very small size frame.
1.0,Very pretty dress put it on and it was sewn cheaply it tore. Had to send back.
1.0,Only one shoe worked.  Now i have to go to ups or find post office to return and Exchange it and wait longer
1.0,Horrible ! Just horrible !
1.0,"It honestly feels like a heavier costume material. Not for an everyday use, unless that itchy material is what you like. I wouldnt recommend unless it Halloween or you got a thing for the Cape look."
1.0,Disappointed. The beads are so tiny (and feel like plastic) that they are almost impossible to use. Would not recommend getting these. Look for something better.
1.0,This is not how it looks in photos and I have a very similar body type too.
1.0,"Pretty sure the “new” one I received was used which was evident by an arm hair trapped in the clasp. The watch doesn’t nearly track steps accurately, and the strap keeper is horrible; just lets the band flop out. I returned because it didn’t work and it was used when advertised as new and $70 above the retail of $150."
1.0,Very cute but it broke after the first day.
1.0,"I wore my new badge to work for the first time, as soon as I tried clocking in, the whole thing came apart in 4 different pieces and now it's completely unusable"
1.0,They are  pretty however the chain is very thin and it broke on the very first time I used it.
1.0,Opened Product  a it was broken
1.0,"Larger than expected and it’s not beige... it’s peach and has white fur not grey like in the photo...  also came very wrinkled and is shorted that described... and I am already pretty short,"
1.0,"If buying this as a stocking stuffer for a child, it is perfect. Otherwise, don't waste the shipping, as it is made of cheap plastic."
1.0,Barely fits my 9 year old sister. Im so upset because the design is cute.
1.0,Terrible material y llego roto se mira muy bonito pero  no vale la pena tuve que tirarlo  aunk es económico..
1.0,"Doesn't stay on, fits so that the little tag always sticks out, slides around no matter what. I thought shelling out decent money for a band of fabric would at least get me good fabric!<br /><br />Do dice. Sorry, guys."
1.0,Money didn’t stay in clip.  Lost $50.  Disappointed.
1.0,The Velcro strip tore lose from glove after wearing only twice.
1.0,"Terrible quality.  First, the sizing is WAY off.  My husband is a size medium and even the XTRA LARGE in this jacket was too small.  The button holes are poorly done and very difficult to button; they are too small for the size of the buttons.  The zipper doesn't go all the way up... whaaaa??  Just all around a big DUD and definitely not worth the money.  Very cheaply made.  Pass on this one; you'll thank me."
1.0,this looked nothing like the picture. it was like a thin halloween costume without the pleats. Very disappointed.
1.0,The material is not normal legging material
1.0,"Don't buy this watch.  It never worked right, certainly couldn't keep time"
1.0,It fits okay BUT IT IS THE UGLIEST DRESS EVER it is not the blue in the picture there are wierd ruffles not shown in picture it looks horrendous do not buy
1.0,Cheap looking cheap quality 🙁
1.0,The quality was very nice but it ran very small. I ordered my regular size a large and couldn't even try it on it was so tight on my arms.
1.0,Shirt is to short. Made for Asian physique.
1.0,Cracked after first use.
1.0,"After many complaints received on AMAZON about these girls shoes being too small,  why do customers pay and still get smaller sizes?  If I know my daughter wears size 8, why is seller sending me a 7?  Shoes have bad smell as of chemicals so wouldn’t want these on my child’s feet."
1.0,This dress looks nothing like the picture and runs small. Cheap Quality. The customer service is horrible and they kept trying to persuade me to keep the dress and give it as a gift in lieu of a full refund.
1.0,"This review is more for the state the dress arrived in, than for the dress itself. As soon as I opened the bag, I could smell the stench of BO. This dress had obviously been worn previously and returned. The odor in the armpit areas was bad. Shame on people who do this!<br />The dress itself was ok; the material a little thin and flimsy - but for the price, adequate."
1.0,"I  received 2 left earings. Instead of them curling with my ears natural shape, one curves up and the other curves down. No, you can't just turn it over.  Very disappointed. Do not recommend."
1.0,The first time I wore these sandals they broke.  The strap between the toes came apart.  I was very disappointed and of course I had to walk around bare foot back to the car to go home!!!!  Very unhappy!!!!!
1.0,"These shoes are horrible, the shoes fit different and are inconsistently made. Cheap labor allows them to make this type of product"
1.0,My grandson loved it But it got a hole in the knee the very first day he wore it.  He didn't have it on for 3 hours so to me it's made poorly
1.0,"WAY TOO SMALL!!!! I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!!! BUTTON HOLE IS SEWN SHUT, LEGS OPENINGS ARE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL AND THE SIZE IS COMPLETELY WRONG!!! WHAT A WASTE OF 34 BUCKS!!!  NEVER EVER AGAIN!!! RETURNING IS WAY TOO MUCH OF A HASSEL....I AM SO DISSATISFIED!"
1.0,"Horrible, barely glows and the clasp broke the instant I put the necklace on my child, super cheap!"
1.0,"Horrible ! .<br />Empezando de la tela, no es elástica,<br />El largo es demasiado corto! .<br />Nada favorecedor para traseros ."
1.0,All the flowers fell off as soon as I took out the package...
1.0,"The long side of the band doesn't lock in place.  I threw packaging away before I tried this, it's a watch band, kind of expected it to be fine.  I would not recommend this band."
1.0,Didn’t like.... look/feel cheap....material is awful
1.0,This runs very large I wear a size 10 and ordered a size 10 it was at least a size larger than needed. And just hope you don't have to return this product because the seller requires you pay for shipping and from Michigan it was $30 which is more than what the shoe cost. Horrible customer service in my opinion.
1.0,"I literally just got this less than an hour ago I opened it up, took it out and the bow is in 2 pieces!"
1.0,"The only reason I bought this case is bc it advertises as waterproof. I put the case on my watch, took a shower, after I got out of the shower I had to take the case off bc of all of the water trapped inside the case. First time I used this ‘water proof’ case and there was more water on the inside of the case than the outside! It’s crazy to me some of the trash people sell."
1.0,These dresses shrink after cleaning. I sent them to my dry cleaners because of the label recommendation.
1.0,wayyy to small
1.0,"Ordered a medium. Inside manufacturer label said 16-18. A printed sticker was put on the inside fabric just below the manufacturer sticker, but the printed sticker said MEDIUM. The nightshirt was HUGE and would have properly been translated Extra Large. Certainly nowhere near a medium.<br /><br />Luckily it did fit a large friend, so I gifted it to her. Unfortunately I am afraid to re-order for fear it will be sized incorrectly. Too bad because I would have loved it."
1.0,"Terribly uncomfortable. Returned. Too large to wear around the back of my head but too small to wear over my head, even with adjusting it. Very hard plastic makes up the circular part and pressed into the tops of my ears."
1.0,Very cheaply made terrible fit.
1.0,My chain broke the next day lmao
1.0,These came and were huge. I get XL for comfort but these wouldn’t even stay up and were for a woman about 6’4” tall. They were just huge.
1.0,received in broken condition- no power- sounds like there is a broken part rattling around in case.  reordering now
1.0,Totally see through! Just sits in my closet because I missed the mark with returning it. So disappointed. Do not waste your money
1.0,When I received the item it was broken in several pieces and the stones were falling
1.0,"The small/medium is BIG --  Way too big for me.  I wear a women's 7.5 shoe.  Also, I tried a pair & am TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.  My feet were cold in these, even with boots.  Because they are so large, I cannot see how I could use them as a &#34;sock liner.&#34;  Would love to return, but not sure it's worth paying the shipping.  UGH!"
1.0,"They all broke within a week of wearing them,  the whole stud broke off."
1.0,Just received it to take to On a trip in November. I am disappointed in color. Picture shown background to be  more on white side. This background is more cream/yellow. I probably should send back.
1.0,I was so excited to receive this only to end up disappointed because it came broken.
1.0,Vest was damaged in the mail. Had a hole in it. Had to return.
1.0,Don’t waste your money with this product.
1.0,"This looked nothing like the picture. In fact, it looked like something a beginning seamstress tried to pass off as a cute shirt. It's poorly cut, the stitching across what's supposed to be cute scallops is black stitching and visible. It's doesn't fit me anywhere up top and the bottom is very baggy and missapen."
1.0,The studs are fine but they do NOT have a ball on the end.
1.0,It is so cheap polyester thattvi am embarrassed to put it on.  It was trashed already
1.0,"They are the same for each side, so they look uneven in the ear. They should be designed so that they appear even when worn. Pretty otherwise, but disappointing."
1.0,I would have loved it if it would fit over more than just one boob it was Tiny would fit a toddler absolutely insane they should really specify that large is in China are Smalls in USA
1.0,Broke same day i got em.
1.0,I didnt like this item for the price i paid . looks kinda cheap and dosent even hold on to your ear.
1.0,"I did like the earrings. I never buy myself jewelry, and my ears are sensitive, so I bought these as a gift to myself. I never had non-metal backs before. The rubber (or whatever it is) backs loosened, and I lost one on day one. Just my luck. I suggest if you buy these, use different backs. It will be a while before I can buy myself another gift. That's why I give it just 1 star. I wasted my money. Bummer."
1.0,Almost cut my fingers circulation off
1.0,Fell apart after 3 washings
1.0,"Do not buy this watch! I've only had this for a couple months and something is wrong with the mechanics inside the watch. It randomly stops working even when the knob is clicked in place and you have to push on the knob hard to get it to start working again. This watch is pointless, you have to reset it all the time."
1.0,It was too big I returned the product and didn’t have back my refund
1.0,Horrible! One fell apart as I tried to put it on. Definitely cheap. Not worth it.
1.0,Description says anti fog. They fog up immediately. What a piece of crap.
1.0,We ordered this shirt for my 8th grader and it said to order a size up because it runs small. He normally wears a child's medium(he is a small guy) so we ordered child Large. The shirt that we received said it was the brand Gildon size L. Now I have bought Gildon shirts before and that is not what their Large shirts look like. The shirt I received could fit my 4 year old niece AND it is 100% cotton so if I gave it to her it would fit her once and then it would shrink in the wash.
1.0,Bought 3 for Christmas and 1 didn't even turn on 😑😑😑😑 ruined my twins christmas now i have to wait for a new one to get replaced to give it to them i hope the new one that i get actually works 😡 overall tbe other two looked ok
1.0,Wasn’t clear that it couldn’t be worn with sleeves. I’m very disappointed & I’m thinking about returning it.
1.0,The spikes have extra metal on the points that almost cut my lip on. Way smaller than my other ones even though it's supposed to be the same gagues size.
1.0,"These panties were Ill fitting, not comfortable, and sized super small. I returned them."
1.0,Button fell off within 30 9 minutes.
1.0,This is a very poor quality product.  The boots came folded in half in a mailing envelope.  They have a very bad smell to them which is intoxicating.  Do not recommend purchasing.  Cheap but that is the quality you get.
1.0,"I tried on the dress out of the box and I loved it. I washed it to wear it soon, it came out of the wash in pieces."
1.0,"Sizing was large. Usually XS fits me in most clothing, however seemed to have run larger than most."
1.0,Ridiculously small.
1.0,Material is Cheap
1.0,Please change the sizing chart of this product.<br />I'm US 9.5 but the shoes are toooo small.<br />So It doesn't fit!!<br />The shoes are beautifuI but I can't use them and I'm living in Mexico and the returning fee is usd 100!
1.0,"I ordered this in hopes a large would fit my 5'7 163lb frame like the top in the pic.<br /><br />Not the case at all, the sleeves are way too short - and look like mc hammer pants on my arms.<br /><br />The large was bulky and too tight, so I would have to order an XL, thunking of exchanging or returning."
1.0,The pattern look better on The picture on Amazon i was very suprise and disappointed
1.0,not good doesn’t work
1.0,Broke IMMEDIATELY.  Never worn. Save your money.
1.0,Fit runs ridiculously small. Couldn't even get over my head. Had to return. Product quality is also very poor.
1.0,The pants were made for men without a figure
1.0,Mala calidad el cierre mágico
1.0,They're cheap cost and cheaper made.
1.0,Okay. I would probably suggest buying a different kind. I should have chosen the other one that was able to hook onto my socks. This product kept bothering me over and over again. I had to readjust numerous times. I won't be buying this again.
1.0,"It's not real 925 silver, the little stones come off the more you wear it. I tried to cancel my order a total of six to eight times maybe more but it wasn't going through and that was a bit weird"
1.0,Was sent what seemed to be a fake watch.
1.0,It wasn’t the color I expected. Totally disappointed
1.0,It’s not a romper!!!!!!!! It’s literally a pair of freakin’ pants!!!! It don’t deserve no stars!!! I needed this for my college daughter to wear to a all white dinner party😡
1.0,Zipper broke immediately after opening package.
1.0,"Really nice looking, but didn’t work when I received it. Hopefully a replacement will."
1.0,"1- Sweep second hand does not stop for timing.<br />2-This watch uses 3 small dials to interpret the measured time which are difficult to read ( 20/20 vision ) and the sweep second hand stops when it should not; thus disturbing the watch time.<br />3-When you adjust the date for 30 or 31 day months, time setting is disturbed. When you push in the crown the time setting is disturbed. I want to return this watch."
1.0,The print is backwards? If that wasn’t done wrong it would have been perfect
1.0,"Be aware this dress is a cheap  fabric material size is too small i went up to one more size and it still too small , now i have to pay the shipping return fee. very dissapointed of this seller and company and amazon too , Amazon is not a very good place to shop for dresses."
1.0,"These are WAY small.  Chinese sizing.  Im normally a large but I read a review that said they went up a size and it was fine...well, it wasnt fine for me.  Their XL is a small.  The picture I included is of a true XL vs. the XL I just received.  So take that into account when purchasing."
1.0,More difficult to see with them on than not
1.0,"Cute dress but very poor quality, zipper broke the first day!"
1.0,Very let down
1.0,"I had to return these shoes…Too narrow.  Do these shoes come in x-wide widths?  If so, I’d like to order them again.  The M widths we’re just too narrow."
1.0,This looks like the boy in the striped pajamas meets prison uniform. Least flattering thing I've ever put on my body and it feels like a burlap sack - so scratchy against the skin. Will definitely be returning
1.0,Advertised as linen. They are thick cotton. Not even linen-like. The elastic waist is big and bunchy and makes you look like you have a large waist.
1.0,I only received 1 pair of glasses when there was supposed to be a set of 6.  The one I received was broken in several places and completely unusable.
1.0,Don't like the jeans at all...the pic that's displayed on amazon is nothing like what I received..
1.0,"SHOULD HAVE READ REVIEWS BEFORE I ORDERED THIS. I AGREE WITH ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND THEN SOME.  I AM SURE IF THEIR CUSOMER SERVICE MATCHES THEIR PRODUCTS, I AM SCREWED.  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER THIS JUNK"
1.0,Poor quality. Way too big!
1.0,"Bought for 6 year old son and even after ensuring proper wear, the glove gets wet on the inside and his hands were freezing after just short time of play with snow. Not recommended."
1.0,Not the same as the pic
1.0,Did not receive this. I received an eat bud holder. VERY disappointed. This was to be a Christmas gift.
1.0,"Fabric flimsy, front seam was very uncomfortable and designed poorly for female’s anatomy."
1.0,"I didn't get the pattern I ordered and it fits  small. In the picture there is no seam because the pattern is continuous but the dress has a seam at the waist, which cheapens the look. I would be more satisfied with the purchase if I could get answers as to how I could exchange it for the print I did order and in a size larger. However, I have yet to get any answers as to where I can send it. There was no packing slip with any instructions for exchange or return. I'm disappointed and will probably just give it away and take it as a learning lesson."
1.0,The material didn't even last 60 days! Huge hole formed. Super cheap quality and thin material. Skip it!
1.0,"The hat arrived in a flat envelope, wrapped in a plastic bag. It has no rigidity in the crown of the hat, has wrinkles and creases in the crown, and has a cheap iron on logo. No patch, no embroidery, just a cheap iron on.  Extremely disappointed!"
1.0,Cheap thin and ugly
1.0,I ordered a large and it fit like it was a small. The material wasn’t stretchy at all it was really tight but I like how they look and the fact that it had a pocket but I for sure won’t be using them.. will be giving them to my younger sibling
1.0,"I was hopeful for these earrings because they are really cute, but sadly I've been disappointed. I've had it for less than a month and it tarnished and turned bronze / copper and then slowly has began to turn green. There is constantly grey smudging rubbing off on my ear. My ear (and I do NOT have sensitive ears actually) swelled and became irritated despite trying to keep the earrings clean and not letting it get pulled. Probably because the polish is rubbing off inside of the piercings (which have been fully healed for a long time). I feel like it can't possibly be stainless steel, that just seems like a blatant lie?<br /><br />Also, I have pretty small ears (normal industrials are always too long for me) and these were still difficult to get it because they were so short. I can't imagine how difficult it would be with someone with normal sized ears. You can barely cram them in there because they just don't even reach, and the immovable turtle makes it impossible to push it through one side at a time."
1.0,"I have to return this item. The material is similar to tent fabric. It looked like a trash sack, had not shape to it what so ever. Read the reviews before you buy!"
1.0,I’ve only had this jacket for 3 months and it stop working very upset because it just started getting cold to use it and it’s not working
1.0,Returned due to weird feel of material and awful fit. The material had a filmy residue over it that made it feel clammy and....oily?
1.0,"It's well made, but the dimensions shown on the website are no where near accurate. It is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than stated. Will not fit my wrist at all. I will be returning it. It's a shame too, because I really liked it."
1.0,"Although these are cute, their size is totally off from any other shoes we have for my son...I even ordered them a size bigger.  Also the shoe box they came in was so damaged it fell apart when I removed it from the shipping bag.  Luckily I was able to return them.  I don't think I'll be ordering again since the size was so far off that it was more of a hassle than it needed to be."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I am a size 14/16, and ordered a 2xl.  It's crazy small. My size 6/8 teen daughter can wear it. Sad."
1.0,The chain and clasp break super easy. They are cute but need better clasp attachments.
1.0,"Looks fancy but not good for wearing, especially if you need to resize the band.  It cannot be resized to fit everyone by professionals"
1.0,"It’s polyester so not a cotton hoodie, which I missed when I ordered it. And horrible fake pockets. Why do those even exist? Surely only to frustrate me- I do love the collar, and cute wooden buttons on the hoodies drawstring. Gunna send it back!"
1.0,CHANGED COLORS REAL FAST IT TURNED BLACK WOULDNT RECOMMEND
1.0,The stones were falling off upon arrival. Not secure at all.
1.0,"My friend spent so much time looking for the perfect watch and this was it- I was hesitant to buy it because of some reviews stating it stopped working, but I figured I would give it a shot anyway. The watch itself is a beautiful design and simple enough to adjust.<br />I purchased it Nov 12th, and gave it to my friend on Dec 16th. After a little less than two weeks of wearing it, the second hand would momentarily &#34;freeze up&#34; and tick back an forth rapidly in one spot then continue. The next day the second hand was permanently stuck between two second marks and would no longer work.<br /> I called the Amazon watch warranty in hopes they would fix it- but they said that repairs were not covered for this watch so I had to settle for a refund. I am extremely disappointed (ps tried a new battery and that did not help)."
1.0,"Ripped right in the middle right after my Amazon return period was up! Loved the bag, but quality is not there!"
1.0,Got this as a gift for Christmas and less than a month later I have lost 2 rhinestones.  It catches on all my clothes and snags them.
1.0,Horrible. They sent something completely different. It was so big it looked like a bear blimp had swallowed me.
1.0,Bought this for my son senior photo shoot this shirt is cheap and rough steer clear.
1.0,It wasn’t terrible-definitely cheap quality-I returned because it fit odd and the bottom of the legs were not straight/sewn weird.
1.0,Stone fall off all time.
1.0,Beautiful watch but quit working as soon as I programed the time!
1.0,"Horrible material, and they run super big"
1.0,The product is not what they said it was. And it doesn't have a loop.
1.0,Prenda en mal estado
1.0,Cpscrewdriver could not remove screws.  Last time I ordered this it worked.
1.0,This is made out of the same material used in medical gowns.
1.0,"Look really, really cheap and posts are very thick for tiny ears but too short for screw to go on all the way.  Will return."
1.0,The zipper was broken on these when I went to use them so they are completely useless to me now.
1.0,"I can't even. This sweater was so cute, until I put it on and then..<br /> BAM!! My pom poms were nipples. I thought,  maybe it's just me,  so my daughter put it on... still all you see are nipples. I said ""you'd have to have NO chest at all to wear this!"" So my son put it on and said.. 'you're right!' It's hysterical, especially in the light brown color.  Check it out in the picture.  Funny?! Yep. Can you wear it? Nope."
1.0,"The headband comes untied so you have to tie the now yourself and it looks stupid. The shorts come up way too high and my 3 month old was swimming in the onesie. Overall, not impressed."
1.0,Was not impressed. Not thick and warm like look in pictures. Thin and not great quality.
1.0,They were bought as a gift but they are to large and of poor quality. Not worth the money to return because I would have to take transportation to return.
1.0,"When I saw the image, It has a lots of beautiful pieces but when I got it, it has ugly pieces and same styles 😡"
1.0,The bands magnetic strip would not even slide into the watch and were very long. Not worth the buy.
1.0,"I ordered the black version of this dress, and I loved it so much that I re-ordered the beige one. The color is nice, but the fit and fabric and cut are extremely different. The beige one is paper thin, it is not an oversized top, it only has one button for the entire top, which means there’s like 6 inch gap. You cannot wear it this way… Terrible quality all the way around."
1.0,"I am very disappointed that after I received the earrings and saw the color of them.... those are Brown instead of PURPLE color...<br />Also, the hooks are not smooth, both edges are rough"
1.0,Colors were not at all as pictured.
1.0,"Fabric was nice but cut wrong and fitted poorly. It was sized off by 2 sizes and fitted poorly for anyone but a twiggy, short figure."
1.0,These pants tore apart after washing 1 time. Not at all like picture
1.0,Ordered green and received black. There is no black option. Fit is extremely large.
1.0,"I had thought this could be used as a mask. The fabric seemed light weight but the item itself was too large, it would not stay in place on my face.  I am not an unusually small framed person."
1.0,"This was a waste of money. Thought my grandson would enjoy a challenge, but it didn't amount to much. The bubbles popped quickly before he could even do anything with them. Would not recommend you wasting your money on this."
1.0,"Perhaps the item I received is defective,, but this was really itchy, tight and super uncomfortable. Not at all what I expected. Coolibar is a very well respected brand, so I assume it's defective.<br />Am returning and Amazon instructions didn't indicate had to be unworn, but Seller instructions had that requirement which seems nuts - how do I know it doesn't work without wearing it??"
1.0,Color was way off. I order dark grey and it looked more like grey and light blue. Return item
1.0,Piece of Crap!!!! I wore it one time and it broke. Garbage!!!
1.0,"Website says size 14 is large so I ordered a xlarge. No way, it is more like a medium. Please don’t say “fits as usual” when it does not. Very unhappy. In the donated pile. Not driving an hour to Kohls. Not after a stroke. No thank you."
1.0,Really cute but not made well. After 1 week of wearing all the charms have broken and are missing.
1.0,never purchase it! I waited for about a month to get this and it came with the broken zipper.
1.0,Garbage....just pure garbage.  I've had better rings from a bubble gum machine.
1.0,"top is regular size small  but bottom is way too small,"
1.0,This material is legitimately plastic. I pulled it out of the package and it feels like a kids Halloween costume from Walmart in the 80’s. I can’t believe anyone keeps this dress. Don’t bother.
1.0,I disliked the fact that it wasn't white & it was too small. I ordered an XL and that was too small.
1.0,They break really easy even if you keep them safe...waste of money
1.0,Sprayers don’t work.
1.0,I couldn't use them at my wedding and neither could my bridal party. They wouldn't fit over our heels. By the way...we all had different shoes on. I don't recommend.
1.0,This product is exactly as pictured but is very small!! I usually Wear a large/x large and this outfit did not even go past my thighs!!
1.0,"Cheaply made, hard to tighten and untighten, DO not WASTE Your Money on this cheaply made junk. returned asap but seller didn't want to accept. The product has major defects."
1.0,Doesn't look like pic at all don't recommend
1.0,Love the look but it broke after one day of use.
1.0,This is an inferior product. The plastic film separates from the surface. The width is too narrow for 155 lb. man.  Packaging hinders ease of access.  ...not worth the money.
1.0,Incredibly tight and I have tiny wrists!  This is the length of a child’s bracelet.
1.0,I ordered correct size and these were extremely small couldn’t even get his foot in them
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1f66131b585c64904f398bffacf2786b]] Fue muchísimo más lo que demoró en llegar que lo que se descascaró. Malisima calidad. No lo compren. Van a perder el dinero. Mi nieta solo lo ha usado unos pocos dias y ya no sirve. Se demoró al punto de ya no quererlo.
1.0,One sleeve is almost 3 inches shorter than the other!
1.0,This shirt is nothing like the picture where it is loose and flowing at the bottom. Runs extremely small. Not pleased with product at all
1.0,"I purchased these for a piercing I have had for 15 years, a piercing that has NEVER given me any problems whatsoever. Within a day of wearing one of these, the piercing was red and irritated. The problem went away within a few hours of removing one of these and installing better quality jewelry (316L stainless steel).  There is NO WAY these are surgical stainless steel. Avoid."
1.0,This product was a gift for my niece and it gave her a really bad rash. She ended up having to be taken to the doctor due to the bad rash effects. I don’t believe this is silver. She is not allergic to silver.
1.0,The stripes did not line up anywhere on the outfit
1.0,This bag IS NOT WATERPROOF as stated
1.0,"These are so dumb. I wish they would just sell the belt in the correct size vs expecting you to cut the end off and put in extra holes, which will look terrible. If you wear a small size belt I wouldn’t buy these. They are very long. They are sitting in the back of my closet, was too busy to return them in time. Will go buy real belts from a store vs buying this knock off junk on Amazon."
1.0,Cutee. But wayyyy to small
1.0,Material is cheep and not attractive to look at. Tried to return but it cost the same to return it as it was to purchase it.
1.0,Womens small is like a kids medium
1.0,This shirt looks very little like the one on the model. It's stiff and not flattering at all. I am donating it.
1.0,"it didn't work for me, my dishes were not getting clean with it."
1.0,"The bands are hard to put on.  The bands don't stay closed.  One band broke while I was sleeping.  They are made cheaply.  Not worth the price.  I would like a full refund, but waited too long to contact Amazon.  Do not waste your money!!"
1.0,I don't like it at all. It's not what is described. Very cheaply made and not any kind of leather. I'd say cheap plastic at best
1.0,"Recibí el producto vino en una talla más grande, pedí XL y me llego XXL ver el producto anunciado dice talla XL y no fue así . Muy mal servicio"
1.0,NOT IMPRESSIVE...
1.0,"This was maybe the worst quality item I’ve ever received from Amazon. The stitching along the neckline was halfway done, and then half of the front was just loops of loose thread hanging down. Also, this item is NOT a sweatshirt! The material is so thin, it’s thinner than a regular t shirt, yet somehow not soft at all. It is entirely see through and entirely trash. I have already started the return process."
1.0,Will never purchase again
1.0,This does not cover anything. The around the neck chain and around the body is so long. It’s made pretty bad
1.0,I ordered this coat a size 7 but it is really small . The coat fits my five year old and it’s extremely small on my 7 yr old
1.0,"The links are unreasonably big, not the color they appear to be in any or all photos. Not to mention, these were not well made as one was broken right out of the bag. Haven't even worn them. Not good at all."
1.0,Chain came apart right away.
1.0,too hard not at all comfortable
1.0,"I read previous reviews for this. I'm usually size XL and ordered an XXL.. It didn't fit in the slightest. Could even button it up. The blouse itself is really cute and looks well made. Flowy silky material.. But the suzi ing on this is literally 2-3 sizes too small. Looking at the shirt, I'd say it's closer to a M.<br />If you have a smaller frame, this may work for you."
1.0,Cheap. Broke before I ever got to wear it
1.0,I bought a size which is smaller that supone  to be.
1.0,Terrible! Bottom black does not match top and is a totally different material all together
1.0,"I was pretty excited to wear these socks.  I bought them for a wedding. The groomsmen were to wear thier favorite team. After the one use, during the wedding... they ripped at the toes. The fabric is thin, and tore, while I wore them."
1.0,The batteries all died within a week of each other and the pin is really cheap.
1.0,Very bad quality I would not recommend
1.0,didn't concentrate on which buyer I got previous awesome ones last time
1.0,"Looks really cheap - i can understand the low price. Much buyer's regret, considering all the charges i had to pay."
1.0,The sizing is too far off. The 4X wouldn't fit a person that wears a size large. The body of the shirt is short also. I returned it within an hour. It's just not worth the money.
1.0,"The material is very thin. I've only worn it a couple of times, yesterday I noticed the sleeves have two small holes. Because I sew I can fix them but they appear to be worn holes.  I wouldn't buy this again."
1.0,"I wore pants one time both pockets were completely ripped and inside leg area immediately started losing stitching. Extremely cheap material, would not buy again!"
1.0,Came a week late and the straight part that goes in the ear was bent in two places. I requested a refund.
1.0,"The leather ripped at the end with the buckle, within weeks. I maybe wore it 6-8 times.<br />And yes, it was a bit stuff"
1.0,It came broken. Did not like the quality.
1.0,"Not a good fit the top part fits so strange and it’s short and looks cheap, I do not recommend."
1.0,I am really sad about this product! I really like the Material in quality of these pants. But this is my second time trying to place an order for a small and getting an extra large sent to me. I don't fit in the extra large and so this is been very disappointing having to send two pairs back. After not getting the size I ordered. :(
1.0,Material is okay and color is lovely. Too bad it's ridiculously small.
1.0,"I bought this thinking it's a great deal. However, although the tights are true to length, they are extremely tight and don't fit my 4.5 year old who is thin and very tall. I cannot imagine they can fit an average child at all. We used one of the tights once and my kid couldn't wait to take them off after a 50 minute dance class. I couldn''t convince her to wear them again. She says they are scratchy and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we were sick for a month with multiple bugs and I missed the return window and wasted my money."
1.0,"See through and does not fit, runs very small at waste. Idk how they show a pregnant woman wearing this bc I am not pregnant and def did not fit my around my waste."
1.0,Before ordering this I emailed you this company asking if this would fit a 9 inch wrist.. and I received back that it would fit my wrist. I received it today and it will not fit my wrist nor even come Close to going over my hand. I really wanted this bracelet. Is there away to get one that is bigger and has more beads so it can fit on my wrist because it’s outstanding quality. Or another one so I can combine the two. I’m super sad because I was excited for this because the company told me it would fit a 9 inch wrist and it won’t :( need help.
1.0,This is basically dyed fabric. I bet it would fade in one wash. Would be cute if better fabric.
1.0,"I did not like the quality of the jacket, and especially disliked the zipper."
1.0,The glasses are really big so if you're not a bigger person I wouldn't recommend them
1.0,The 2X fits like an XL. Not loose like pictured.
1.0,Doesn't have pins to replace my old watch's strap which was disappointing.
1.0,Muy frajil
1.0,I dislike the fact when I first purchased them they were  3.00 a pair now 2nd time around they are now 12.00
1.0,"The pocket had 2 holes in it.  The back of the jacket was faded so it looked like there was 2 stripes going from top to bottom.  The jacket runs very small.  Size Med looks like an XS adult.  My daughter is 12 years old.  5'5"". Thin, tall & athletic.  Wears an adult small.  This jacket was to small for her.  I specifically bought this jacket because it was thin and the pockets had zippers.  This jacket would be easy for my daughter to tie around her waist and put stuff in the pockets and zipper the pockets.  Due to COVID the kids have NO lockers in school & eat a lot of sack lunches- that are not great (thank you COVID).  I wanted the zipper pockets to put fruit snacks or something in her pockets and then zipper the pockets shut. This jacket would be thin enough to carry around all day during school, shove in her backpack or to tie around her waist - & that is exactly what I wanted along with the zipper pockets.  Honestly the jacket didn't even fit my 8 year old son.  I will be returning.  I will probably order a larger size due to the fact it is everything I am looking for & I live in MN so finding a light weight jacket this time of year isn't going to happen.  Hopefully by winter they can have lockers because I have no idea what she is going to do with her winter gear."
1.0,"They were awesome. Unfortunately after wearing only like 3x, all of the seams started falling apart. This is after I carefully washed and hung to dry."
1.0,Items fit right. Not the same color as the skirt that’s pictured! And if they didn’t have the one that’s pictured they should’ve just refunded me my money! I don’t know who put this crap together but burgundy navy blue beige & light pink Skirt does not go with a gray shirt ! Planning on returning item!
1.0,This is the farthest thing from a beach towel or any other kind of towel. I'm very disappointed. I can only describe it as a sarong. It's almost see through. It's a very cute print and that's all I can say for it.
1.0,Dislike.  To slim  no shape to it.  Not happy with it. Look like I pay 1.00 at good wheel
1.0,This item was shipped to me with two stains that I didn’t notice until I put on the shirt (after I threw away the packaging UGH). Now I can’t get my money back. I’m so upset! DO NOT BUY! You will get a stained shirt in return. Smells disgusting as well. Thought I was buying a brand new shirt.
1.0,"This is a low quality shirt, looks sloppy on and the collar is not made right."
1.0,I was really looking forward to these earrings. They look so vibrant and pretty. But upon receipt the color received was completely different than photos. The one I received was light blue and pink beads. No orange or royal blue color as shown. Also they were much shorter than it looks on mannequin. It was 3 inches long at best. Sadly returned because I didn't want light blue and pink. I wanted the colors shown. Already returned otherwise I would post a picture.
1.0,"After 3 day one shoe stopped working and will not charge, bad product"
1.0,These socks shrunk a few sizes after only single wash :(
1.0,nope dont get it
1.0,"I need to say I truly liked the watch itself (as in the chronometer), but the watch ""band"" is fragile and either faulty or low quality and renders the watch useless.  After just 4 months, the ""rubberish"" watch band broke when it snagged on the sleeve of my suit jacket.  It's not like I fell off a cliff and snagged the band on a tree branch on the way down but rather just caught it in a sleeve of a wool suit.  The suit survived just fine but the watch band broke.  (Side note:  The Amazon vendor who sold the watch is fine and this review does not reflect on them whatsoever.)<br /><br />When I contacted Casio customer support they refer you to a 3rd party customer service company who then refused to replace watch band stating they are told by Casio that watch bands are NOT covered by the 1 year warranty regardless of the situation (hmm - sounds like this watch band is problematic); however, amazingly you can purchase a replacement crappy watch band for just $80 plus shipping and tax.<br /><br />I then contacted ""Casio"" customer support again and explained the entire scenario and was told again to contact the same service center and that this was ""out of their hands"".  Out of their hands?  Who manufactured the watch and received payment for it - the NJ watch service center or Casio?  Very disappointed in Casio - they do not stand behind their warranty, they hide behind a 3rd party, and now I have a 4 month old, $400 ""outdoor"" watch with no band because it came in contact with its nemesis (the wool sports jacket)."
1.0,Q no fue entregado y quisiera ablar con un representante para solucionar mi problema
1.0,The spaceships are facing the wrong way....I'm going to have to take the earrings apart and reassemble so they will hang correctly.
1.0,I received the order but it was broke
1.0,Disliked the entire purchase. They're not velvet. They have ripped seams straight out of the packaging. This is a full on disappointment.
1.0,"I do not like the fact that these are baby earrings and I gad to wait forever to find out, yet they’re beautiful just tiny as ever!"
1.0,"Very poor packaging. Not as advertised. It didn't come with a case as advertised, it came with fake leather pouch that will only protect it from scratch and there's even no cleaning cloth. False advertising is not a good practice!"
1.0,Pants were perfect and once I washed them the length shrunk about 2inches. Now they are way too short.  :(
1.0,Nice gloves but they do not work on my touch screens. I tried with my phone and iPad they don't work. Don't waste yor money.
1.0,Broke the second day I wore it.
1.0,Do not buy!!!<br />They only send one outfit- the romper is missing!!- and the I received runs too big! Smh
1.0,I thought it was a 3 pack with 3 different colors ...why would I need 3 of the same color?
1.0,Turned my finger green 1 day after wear. You can find way better quality for the same price elsewhere.
1.0,I am a petite girl with an hourglass figure and this corset made me look like a box.
1.0,Don’t
1.0,The fit was terrible. Too big at top and too short. I ordered a large. I can only imagine how short a medium would be.
1.0,Fell apart and so i wont be buying that product again
1.0,Smaller than the ones from the hospital and a much more uncomfortable fabric. Not comfortable on a badly swollen foot post surgery
1.0,Should have known better as I'm 5'10 and have issues with waistlines on dresses. This hit above my waistline creating an awkward fit for me. Returning this for sure!
1.0,gave away
1.0,The one earring didnt come with a cuff piece and just hangs straight down.
1.0,Poorly made product.  I received one bent cross and one chipped glass cabochon.  Seller needs to inspect products before shipping.
1.0,"It took me a good 20 mins of fiddling to get the end off in order to find out that this didn't fit my watch. So frustrating. Not 42mm at all, it's more like 42.5...."
1.0,Once it dries the fabric is horrifically hard
1.0,it broke and fell off first day I wore it and there is no return policy
1.0,Fell apart 1st time I wore it. But it was cute.
1.0,I went through the question answer thing and there is no way to close the wrap dress. Someone mentioned there was a hole along the seam...THERE IS NONE! Ziltch. I wanted to love this dress but for the price I paid only to have no way to close off wrap dress this gets a one star. I usually never rate my purchases so low but this has got to be the first one ever.
1.0,"Very disappointed.  The clip was half on, they wouldn't stay on a shoe, they flopped around and fell off.  They didn't match.  One skull was way off centered, and the flowers were smushed.  I returned."
1.0,It was very cheap looking and out of shape
1.0,Magnets aren't even strong enough to hold them in my nose
1.0,US shipping however this is made in China.
1.0,Not attractive
1.0,"I really liked the softness and color. However, after the first wash there are huge loose pieces of yarn from top to bottom. There are so many it would take days to try and pull them back through."
1.0,This is marketed as a women’s costume but is child sized. I normally wear a medium or large and ordered large to be safe. The skirt was about the width of one of my legs. I also waited forever to get it. I do not recommend this set at all.
1.0,"The fabric is cheap, and the decoration horrible."
1.0,"These are more like spandex, not what I thought I was buying for my son."
1.0,Not true to the size that you order will not be ordering again
1.0,Una porquería no es mascara no sirve
1.0,What a waste. Color chipped away immediately. Don't buy.
1.0,Ugh! I have been searching Dar and wide for cure cheap fake septum piercings since I can't get mine done. These (and all others I've found on this site) suck! They are way too big and don't even bend so you can actually clip it to your nose. Very disappointed.
1.0,Nunca recibí el pedido
1.0,"They are cute and a great size but definitely look silver, not gold!"
1.0,"Absolutely one of the ugliest handbags I have ever purchased. It is NOT leather. If it is its, I don't know, raccoon leather. Lol. Sent it back."
1.0,"These bibs are horrible, they are too thin and seperate.  Unfortunately, I opened them the day before I needed them for a crab feast and I couldn't return them.  This item is overpriced."
1.0,Not applicable
1.0,"Did not like this bra. Thin material, uncomfortable and not enough support for my 36Ds."
1.0,Only a small nickel sized area in lower inner edge of glasses is magnified
1.0,"I purchased the short sleeve top. I'm 5'3, D cup. I ordered xl. I didn't like it at all. The mesh material looks cheap. The picture looks like the shirt would be pass the hip but is not, it's almost like a crop top. The shirt that they sent me is nothing like the picture, I'm not sure that they even send me the right top that's how different it looks. The top fit loose and short. Also it came damaged."
1.0,"No nose-tab to keep a close fit around the bridge of the nose, poor pleat design, and uncomfortable elastic straps."
1.0,Cute but the ear pieces are so short they barely go to the ear Won't be buying them again
1.0,Not at all as described or as the sellers photo shows. Smaller. This is not for a Pandora bracelet. Only a cheap jump ring. Don’t bother purchasing. $5 item.
1.0,"The material is very very flimsy, the straps broke after 4 washes."
1.0,Bad bad bad..... I saw these and thought I have to have em. To keep it super simple the are tiny super tiny like made for infants ears and when I finally got them the little pearly stones had called out. The post on one of the earrings was bent. You get what you pay for I guess. I have had many good buys from costume jewelry and I think I should stick to the company that I normally buy from here on Amazon
1.0,Had to send back to the shipper because the pants were way to small ordered a size 32/30 and it came in as a 24/30
1.0,Material looked like a slip. Not enough fringe and it was only on the front. I should return it.
1.0,Worst purchase ever...cheaply made...poor quality.
1.0,Wash it and dried it now it's too small.
1.0,"Do not waste your money.  Glasses  get misty, rather than foggy.  Expensive glass cleaner."
1.0,These completely fell apart within a day!
1.0,"We have had this bag for two weeks. I use it every day like a diaper bag-it is awful! I loved initially! It's big abd has awesome pockets. However, all of the lining has ripped and is peeling off. I'm very disappointed in this."
1.0,It’s very small like for kids.
1.0,"This is the shittiest piece of metal I have ever put in my body, the description was not what I received. There is no small ball at the end of this nose ring to stop it from sliding out, so in short I have a lot of very useless pieces of metal that I can’t use for actual jewelry because it won’t stay in."
1.0,The chain broke after a few hours of me wearing it. It was also extremely difficult to put on.
1.0,there were no spring bars included! my old one's broke. If the metal spring bars were included it would have been better. I had to buy them separately at a watch store. If they had been included it would have been excellent.
1.0,Size was smaller than expected.  Return was going to cost $55 to send to seller.  Giving it to Goodwill.
1.0,The description says 3.5&#34;. It's 1 inch at best.
1.0,Terrible item ...... Looks cheap ..... Don't fit right and there Is a hole at the seam on front at left breast. Not worth $25 maybe $5
1.0,"I'm trying to understand why some people say that they like the slippers so much. They feel like very thin cheaply made flip-flops that are covered with fuzz. Sadly, a good part of the fuzz was gone the in the toe area after the first week, and most of it was gone by week two. They are very uncomfortable, and feel thinner than Walmart's $.97 flip-flops.<br />I really hate to bash a product so bad, but these flip-flops aren't worth $.97.  I rely largely on reviews to help me purchase products on the Amazon, and I often receive products at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive a discount on these flip-flops. I trusted the reviews that others left stating that these flip-flops for really great. To be fair, my feet are used to being treated to really great house shoes. I usually purchase Ugg slippers. I wasn't expecting slippers of that quality, but I was expecting some that would last more than a week."
1.0,I ordered two dresses just different colors and the black one is made out of a completely different material.  Not soft or stretchy like the tie dye one.  Very disappointed!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:74577cc4a14cc990fd8c48c45797e0fb]] The straps on the chest are way too loose and do not lay flat like in the item photos, which makes the shirt awkwardly unusable as is. The shirt material is very soft, the lace sleeves are cute, but the straps are ridiculous."
1.0,This watch is &#34;Titanium&#34;?  It scratches very easily with normal wear.  I've had it for less than a month and it looks like its old already.  The seller will not take it back.  Clearly not worth the money.  DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!!
1.0,"Way too small, but tag said right size"
1.0,"The description reads ""3 pack"". The package only had 1 in it. Be advised, this is NOT a pack of 3."
1.0,I actuslly will be returning the shoes.  They are super cute but smell strong of gasoline or chemicals.  I know there is sometimes a new shoe smell but this is worse.  Just worrord me too much to put them on my 18 month old.
1.0,the shoes came in totally different design than it looks like. Be aware!!
1.0,Too big for large
1.0,do not like the feel of the fabric at all. its kind of crape paper look and feel and itchy.
1.0,I wear a size 3X consistently but the reviews said this ran small so I ordered the largest size which is a 5X and I couldn't even fit it over my head because the arms were so small. Definitely will not buy from this seller again.
1.0,"La talla es grande pida la talla que pida, no se puede regresar el producto,  porque cobran como $200 dólares por regresar.<br />Puse una estrella pero si pudiera pongo cero. No sirve"
1.0,"This must be interested for toddlers as it is extremely small, the headband will give you a terrible headache"
1.0,"Worse shirt to buy for all my military folks wearing the uniform. Too thick of material, the neck collar is the worse, didn’t fit as expected either."
1.0,"The original pop beads were made with good material, however this product was cheaply made, many beads a misfit!"
1.0,"Color is too pale, even for me, and I'm about as white as casper."
1.0,I hate it it's so small I expected them to come way larger and for that amount of money like✋
1.0,Very unhappy with the finish of the lace. I ordered champagne color but it looks peach. Would not buy from this company again
1.0,"It's white and obviously I knew it not cashmere, but was expecting something that looks like one, like in the picture. It doesn't."
1.0,Completely fake ring. Not a real stone or metal. All plastic. Greatly disappointed
1.0,"Smaller than they look, no I didn't wear them."
1.0,I waisted my money they don't fit unless you are a 2 year old then they might fit
1.0,"Not what I expected, quality is a joke at best. Don't waste your money. Ripped both of them just putting them on"
1.0,Weird fit<br />I’m gonna return this dress
1.0,Masks were limp and would not stand straight.  Ribbons were poorly attached to the masks (some came off immediately) and were a poor option for attaching the masks to the head.  Would not stay in place.
1.0,I liked the look. However the clasp didn't close. I'll need to replace it before wearing it. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"They look super cute, but when I got them it’s more like there a costume material and I wasn’t a big fan. I wish they were regular legging material"
1.0,"Poor fit, terrible hemming, visible edges. This is literally one single piece of fabric trying to pass for a dress"
1.0,"The title clearly says wool. There's even a little sticker on the package that I received that says wool. But the actual packaging lists all of the materials, and not a single one of the components used is wool. Completely false advertising. I was specifically shopping for wool socks because I happen to live in a place where there is winter."
1.0,"2 pair are backward. You have to put back thru then screw front on. Yeah, my kids are gonna do that after gym class. Yeah right. And it was first and second choice by all 3 girls.  Dissatisfied."
1.0,"Ordered the large too big, ordered medium, same size too big. Fabric is far too heavy towards the bottom, the entire sweatshirt is pulled down looking like a blanket. Does not fit like the images even though I am the same build. Assuming it’s a different sweater than what is being shipped to customer, bait and switch. Wouldn’t expect anything else from them."
1.0,The shirt was adorable but the shorts were ill fitting and WAY too big
1.0,Ridiculously ugly. It’s possibly fun as a joke but it won’t fool anyone. The photo is unrealistically large (about 20% too big) and the angles don’t work. I thought it’d be a fun thing to wear to get reactions out of colleagues but the joke is on me!
1.0,it is so confusing how to figure out the right size to get. the quality is good this is the second time I purchased rose lady since I like the quality of the first one even it is too tight and bites. I tried to ordered again and made sure to get size bigger. unfortunately it was too big this time trying to follow the chart. just a waste of money
1.0,Never was received. So I can't rate ii's quality. No feedback from Amazon or company. Not worth the trouble buying again.
1.0,Does not look or fit like photo. I expected it to run small and accounted for that when I ordered. The fit was ok but this is a polyester shirt. It says poly-Cotton but it fits like pure poly and looks cheap. The sequin sleeves don’t even look like the pic. I’m returning it. Nothing like the pic.
1.0,"Looks like a pretty good shoe. Bought for playing Racquetball.  Put in custom orthotics, seemed to fit okay, but after 45mins of play, had to take off and return to previous shoes.  Toe box too small, push large toes too much, causing intense pain.<br /><br />The rest of the shoe felt a little big loose, go going up a size wouldn’t work for me.  I’ll probably just throw them away."
1.0,Very weak!
1.0,Impossible to get on. The fabric does not stretch enough to get the sock started.<br /><br />False advertising.
1.0,"Runs short and narrow.  Velcro dude closure is very secure, hard to open."
1.0,Brittle couldn’t even get on before it snapped in half
1.0,"It is really very unfortunate how terrible this bag is, because it's such a great concept. The thing is this: It doesn't look or work a thing like they say it does.<br /><br />You'll notice that in the product pictures here on Amazon and on the company's website, the bag is always standing proudly at attention. But just wait until you get the thing in your home. There are no rigid materials used, so the bag tends to collapse downwards and lists to one side. It does this even when loaded, though not as badly. Employing rigid materials would solve this problem. It makes it terribly difficult to load anything into the bag. I have a photo backpack which is far more rigid and this problem doesn't exist with that bag. Surely these guys could do something similar.<br /><br />Next, the shelves are a total joke. Again: GREAT concept, HORRIBLY implemented. First off, the second, or lower shelf C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T-L-Y unsnaps from the bag. Both shelves are held in place by four snaps. And while the snaps on the upper shelf seemed to stay put, the second shelf unsnapped literally every time I used the bag. Second issue: THE SHELVES WARP!!! Yep, you read that correctly. When you get the bag, the shelves are nice and flat, providing a nice flat surface for a shelf. But literally within about two days of use, placing a pair of sweats, a tee-shirt, a pair of socks, a pair of underwear and a belt (not exactly heavy stuff here!) on the upper shelf, it began to bow and become misshapen. When I returned it, I removed the shelf and it looked more like a &#34;U&#34; than a flat shelf. The lower shelf did the same thing, but not to the same degree.<br /><br />Save the hassle. Look elsewhere."
1.0,"After less than 24 hours of wear it turned my finger green! I returned the ring and will not order again. I do not recommend, unless you do not mind a green ring around your finger."
1.0,Product did not work. Would not heat up. I returned them.
1.0,It is a photo of a sparkling fabric not sparkling at all it’s too think and cheap! I want my money back but didn’t pay that much so I’m done with it !
1.0,"Very cheap, came waded up in a ball.Didn't use it, ended up throwing it away."
1.0,Feels just like wearing a cardboard diaper.
1.0,Broke before I opened it
1.0,Way too small. Ordered sized large and I’m a 12. This was stretchy but still way too tight.
1.0,"Unfortunately, it was a very bad quality. Not recommend."
1.0,They broke within 3 rides from the frame. Cheap and very uncomfortable to wear. The ends were also very sharp.
1.0,Bought for grandson' s gift. Very disappointed. Cheap material. Pocket tore first time worn. Waste of money!
1.0,"I will never ever order from them again!!!! My item arrived late and when I did get it the earring was broken. I let them know and sent pictures like they asked me to and all they said was can you fix it yourself which really made me upset. I bought this item and it was sent to me broken and they wouldn't do anything about it I can't ever wear it, so again I will never ever purchase anything from them again!!!!!"
1.0,This drags the floor and is WAY too long. I would have to find a way to hem it to make it usable.
1.0,Cheap and trying to put them on killed the mood
1.0,Okay masks . Not the best quality. Returned them.
1.0,Way too small for ADULTS!!!
1.0,"I often have to order bigger sizes to accommodate my large bust and this dress was no exception. Unfortunately, the bust was still tight and the body was HUGE and unflattering so I had to send it back."
1.0,"Awful material, feels nothing like the way it looks. The material is more of a plastic bag or parachute material, also it’s very short and I’m only 5’2 will be returning."
1.0,I received only 7 charms and not 10.
1.0,The Hearts Are Lovely. but The Necklace came With The Chain Twisted All Through The Heart And The Earrings Were Missing the Hoop That Goes Through The ear. This Was a Christmas gift so I did not realize everything was messed up until my granddaughter opened The Box. Very Embarrassing.
1.0,All the sparkles fell off after 1 wear.
1.0,You can see straight through it. I returned it.
1.0,They are only glued to the skull and they both came apart half way through the first day I had them
1.0,I should have ordered permanent press clothing.
1.0,not anything like the pic!!! do not order!!!
1.0,Material is fluffy and nice but the shoes themselves are so flat and stiff they're uncomfortable. Wore for 5 mins and never again.
1.0,"Was not told in description that it wasn't 3 dimensional. In the photo it is misleading. Piece was almost black when it came in, went to polish it with a cloth and the bail broke off, the piece is hollow and had a crack in the back near the base that appeared to be soldered. If I would've bent it slightly, the bottom would've broken off. I understand it wasn't an expensive piece but it held no sense of quality for being pewter. I manage a jewelry store and understand stones and metals and this wasn't anything is recommend."
1.0,"At first I really like them, bought them for a 4 day trip to the beach. They cracked a bit which I didn’t expect, but thought oh well it’s a minor crack, can still wear them later on.<br />I put them away till the next vacation and when I looked at them I saw that they were kind of curled. When I tried to straighten them, they just cracked in half pretty much. Never had flip flops so that in my life. They are now trash after wearing for a few days in april."
1.0,Very cheap flimsy not good condition
1.0,This was a joke and another disappointing clothing purchase from Amazon. Not at all as described! Look at the neck! It also was shorted than it looked.
1.0,I wore these one day only and the post broke off.  Luckily I was able to find all three pieces to return for refund.
1.0,Very disappointed. Broke while putting it on the first time. Band came off.
1.0,"These are terrible. Very small, sized for a child or very petite teen. They are very poor quality. Not very stretchy and break easily. Total waste of money."
1.0,Completely synthetic cotton does not exist and makes it sweat even in winter unsorted
1.0,"The dress was pretty, however I sent two dresses back.  The three hooks in the back of the dress was missing the connecting hooks. There was no connecting hook at the zipper, and no hooks at the top of the dress to hold the dress together at the top."
1.0,"I bought a larger as a gift for someone. I was worried that it wouldn't arrive on time. It did but it's soooooo small. maybe a child can wear it. It's very thin, I live in Colorado, we need heavy jackets. This is more like a light sweater, but not a jacket at all. It's not made of any type of wool material. It's polyester and spandex. dry clean only"
1.0,The watch looked great. I bought this for a father's day gift for my husband but when he tried it the clasps on the watch was broken. I was sooo disappointed I had to return it.
1.0,Turns green around the neck  first time you wear it
1.0,Found out it wasn't real when I went for an MRI. It twisted so tight under the magnet I almost lost my hand!
1.0,These are cheap looking and ugly.
1.0,"Arrived stuffed into a tiny plastic bag approximately 8 X 6. It would have been okay, because of the fabric, BUT the beading is ALL cheap sequins. Even at the waistline where it looks like faux jewels, it is simply huge (GAUDY) sequins. The overall fit is just slightly ""too big"". It was a huge disappointment, this could have been a lovely dress, I loved the actual style, but the execution was poor."
1.0,Pattern was different from what was advertised.
1.0,"This watch did not hold up to life with my 14 year old son for even 1 whole week. Yes, it was a fun long weekend where we spent time in a manmade lake and rafting on a river, but it was supposed to be water resistant to 50m... Not cool!"
1.0,"Way too small. At least 4 inches smaller. I am regularly an 18/20 and that's the size I bought. I couldn't get it on. I gave it to my friend who is a size 12 and it fit her perfectly. I didn't return it because she is going to keep it, but it wasn't even close to correct sizing for me."
1.0,One ply tissue paper is thicker than this cardigan. Not impressed
1.0,"Great idea, just way overpriced."
1.0,Cute but wayyyyyy to small.
1.0,"so scratchy and itchy and stiff. not ""fluffy"" at all. I was looking for something soft similar to a patagonia retool snap t as a loungewear type sweatshirt - this is not it at all"
1.0,"Very disappointed after immediately seeing this locket. To begin with, it says this locket should be over 12 ounces.<br />LOL it was more like 2 ounces at most! And then I look on the back of the locket and it had smears and marks all over it.<br />Am I expected to re-polish and clean this locket after receiving it? It was immediately returned.<br />Complete disappointment."
1.0,This is horrible!!!! I am beyond disappointed. I bought this as a gift and I'm too embarrassed to give it. You can even see the chain. Seriously I have NEVER EVER seen a chain this small and thin and the pendant is very small too. Trust me when I say Do not waste your money
1.0,The fabric of this shirt is horrible.  I should have returned it right away but I liked the color so removed the tags. I have other shirts by the same company none are made of this material.
1.0,This bag split it's seams ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT! Piece of junk. I bought 2. Both failed without over filling within 1 hour of packing. A big waste of money.
1.0,"Cute and comfy, but both if the ties came undone and out of the moccasin within less than a month and now I can't get it back in the holes.<br /><br />Update- down to 1 star. The stitching has started to unravel. I don't think I use these an abnormal amount. I have had these a little over a month now. I've had other pairs last me for years and not do this."
1.0,Put in the washer with other clothes prior to wearing. Hood strings came out of 2/3 oh them. Not super awesome. Probably sending back.
1.0,"This was a “Return” item for me, it’s a very cheap product"
1.0,Bottoms way to big top fits just right
1.0,Product is very very cheap. Doesn't work at all
1.0,"These are not as pictured. Terrible quality. I'm sad too, the picture looks so cute"
1.0,"Ever try on an outfit and it makes you look like a baked potato? Well this is one of those. It was so awkward fitting I couldn't stop laughing. To be fair, maybe I'm just shaped like a russet but I kind of doubt it."
1.0,It did not stick.. at all
1.0,Very cheap. Buckle broke on both belts within two uses. Terrible!!
1.0,Total failure!! It was damaged 😡 It will be returned for sure.
1.0,Its nice material I would have kept it but it’s not fitted at all. Its a men’s cut..the shoulders are wide the back flows out making you look bulky and odd
1.0,Cheap polyester garbage
1.0,Terrible terrible quality. It was almost like a sheer curtain. Really sad because it was actually cute if quality was up to par.
1.0,The worst kids belt ever<br />It may cut your child fingers sharp edges
1.0,I usually love all my amazon orders.  Not this one.  Tiny tiny -- like for a small child...maybe that is what they are for and I didn't notice.  Tried to open to slide on ear and broke immediately.  Just tossed them out as didn't want to go through returning
1.0,Item was broken when delivered. Too small for my 8yr old son also.
1.0,The material was TERRIBLE.  It felt like a paint smock for preschoolers. I do no recommend this product. I am returning it.
1.0,I gave it to my husband is to big and style looks more manly
1.0,"The dress for great, was looking cute. In one night the seam in the back of the skirt of the dress came apart and the shoulder strap broke. Bad sew job, complete crap."
1.0,"First off, the necklace is VERY LONG. If you are short you may want to look at a different necklace. Second, after my third time of wearing the necklace it broke like a raw noodle!!"
1.0,I love the design on the bag but my bag broke out of nowhere ... do not buy this bag!!!
1.0,It was to tight around the chest! I gave it away😉
1.0,Bad quality. Not even close to what they have shown in the images
1.0,Bought 3x Shirt extremely too tight
1.0,I only received the pajama bottoms😡It was a Christmas gift
1.0,Can't even pull up legs.  I am aware it should be tight but this sizing is way off. Waist is 38-40 and it says 39-41.  It would fit someone who was a 32 waist maybe.
1.0,The band would not stay clasped together and now the hardware is broken and will no longer attach to the watch. I've only had this for 5 months!
1.0,"I searched amazon for wool-free winter socks. These said they contained cotton, spandex, and it never once mentioned containing wool. I do NOT buy or wear wool since I know how it is typically made (sheep are abused. Surprise. Now stop buying it). I called and reported it, hopefully they've fixed the product description. And I learned if you're looking for warm, wool-free socks, just look up ""fuzzy socks"" instead."
1.0,it's not real silver
1.0,I returned this shirt because it was very tight. It did not fit in the arms of the chest. It is cropped. I do recommend sizing up.
1.0,I have normal size wrists and this was WAY TOO SMALL. It cut off my circulation as soon as I put it on. Looks like it would maybe fit a newborn baby.
1.0,"Arrived from another country, size and cut to small for america shape."
1.0,Color seems faded and not puffy like the pic plus too wrinkled to fix design.
1.0,"Loved the dress and enjoyed wearing it once. Washed it per the directions, and the colors bled all over the white part of the dress. Had to throw it in the trash."
1.0,"It’s really cute, but the chain broke and the charms fell off within two days of using it. Cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,As soon as I opened it all fell apart.  This was not worth my money. keep your money and just splurge on ones that are a little bit more expensive.
1.0,"The quality of this dress is very cheap.  The material it's made of reminds me of the cheap material used for Halloween costumes.  I would use this maybe as a swimsuit cover, but not for an actual evening out.  The tie around the waist is very awkward.  I bought both medium and large since it was hard to figure out what size to get based on comments.  I'm 5ft tall, 138 lbs, and a size 4-6.  The large was too big and medium fit just right.  The material is too thin for undergarments.  I was disappointed when I received this dress as it had many great ratings and talk of 'amazing' quality when it is anything but that."
1.0,"The material on the outside is more like brushed sweatpants material or jogger material, nothing like any athletic leggings I have ever tried on. They have zero tummy control even though they are advertised for it. And they fit incredibly loose and look awful. I will not be able to wear these as pants on my vacation like I planned. Instead I will have to wear them as thermals underneath other clothes. Very disappointed."
1.0,It was way to small in the chest and in the arms. Was very uncomfortable to try to put on. I had bought a 3xl and fit like a large.
1.0,VERY VERY THIN CHEAP MADE
1.0,this is junk it was not worth what was paid for this costume prop not a toy
1.0,"It was way too small for my septum, daith or cartridge. Doesn’t close securely either."
1.0,Too filmsy for me.<br /><br />Returned
1.0,This isnt long enough to tie around the back of your neck without making the scarf part very short. I ordered the pink one and whilst the face mask was pink the rest of it was orange and green. It looked crazy. I returned mine and will be sticking to my homemade masks.
1.0,"Been wearing regular flip flops and thought this type might be more comfortable. Not so - my heels hang partially off of the inside of the back of the sandals. In other words, the sandals don't line up with my feet."
1.0,Very disappointed that the sizing was WAY OFF! I wear a 3x in almost everything and I couldn’t even get this over my shoulders. 😩
1.0,Kept Falling off my glasses!
1.0,"Do not recommend, for the price I should have seen this coming, the hook is plastic and broke after a day of my dog wearing it."
1.0,Cape was cheap !!! And was not like the description of picture
1.0,smells horrible like mildew or toxic chemicals
1.0,They look nice but they hurt my ears. They burn so bad and and feel so uncomfortable. I wish I could wear these but it’s impossible for me to. :(<br /><br />UPDATE: Over 12 hours later and my ear piercing holes are beyond sore and swollen.
1.0,Didn't like it. Cheap looking.
1.0,Not what i expected fit like a cap.
1.0,Doesn’t lay right in your belly button
1.0,"Screw came out of lens, and one lens was not clear"
1.0,Horrible sweater not what it displayed! Material is horrible and too much of a price for what you get! Returning immediately!!
1.0,"It was so pretty! I was so excited to get this dress & try it on.. but no,  the arms were tiny. The dress fit every other way except for the sleeves, they were so small tht my 9 year old daughter couldn't comfortably wear it."
1.0,"This heart looks nothing like the picture on Amazon!,"
1.0,Fast shipping but didn't get any thing that is in picture only the leopard an plain pink was in mine an three that said ruthless NONE of the roses or butterflies. Everything about shipment timing packaging was fine<br />But very upset about what it says your going to get an what I got! An yes I know it's random but I want variety NOT 85% all pink<br />Very disappointed
1.0,"It’s a boxy cut, rope type of dress. Not nice"
1.0,"This piece is ok.  Especially for the price,  thing is, it looks like how much it cost me, if that makes any sense.  I wouldn't buy it again."
1.0,This is missing the remote and they do not work at all! Scam!
1.0,Quality was poor. It was broken when I got it.
1.0,Unfortunately it broke after a few days
1.0,"The old saying goes, you get what you pay for. Boy does that apply here. Total, complete piece of junk, from the flimsy clasp to the end links that are too big for a 20mm watch, which terribly scratched my lugs. Absolutely horrible quality control. AVOID."
1.0,Strap broke the first time I carried it...looks good  but not worth it
1.0,Was way to small.. waste of money
1.0,"Skirt material makes you look like you have a weird shape and makes you look like you are bigger from the hip area pockets might be the reason that adds to the problem  , fits very loose and it’s super see through. Very disappointed with the material and this skirt"
1.0,"This looks NOTHING like the image. I actually don't even think it's worth 1 star. The fabric is so thin it's almost see-through and the fit/cut is just terrible. Makes me look about 10 lbs. heavier. Just keeping it to sleep in, but I wouldn't have even spent $5 on it had I known."
1.0,Waste of money!. Backings did not fit. Post to soft to put a backing on. All I can say good customer service.
1.0,I bought two and on both the handle  keeps falling off.
1.0,Didn’t like it<br />Wouldn’t cover my chest. Way too small up top
1.0,Didn't come one time. Only got one when the order did show (over a week later then the max delivery date) and was so full of starch it was practically unmoldable. Not adult size or even teenager size. The fabric is really nice though it did look like it was well put together I did not get to test it...
1.0,"Fit was nice, but the leggings are see through despite what the description said. I’ll be sending these back for a refund."
1.0,"The jacket was low quality, not worth $30 and the strings fell apart after washing once on cold and gentle cycle."
1.0,Pedí el 38 y enviaron el 41. Decepcionada
1.0,This necklace & earrings are cheaply made and cheap looking. I bought the set to wear to a Christmas party and ended up not wearing any of it. I am sorely disappointed.
1.0,Falling apart just after a month. Cant return them now. wont buy them again
1.0,I could not keep mask over my nose when talking. It constantly works down.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY too big for ID205L<br />false advertizing, waste of time, disappointed"
1.0,"The material is fancy not soft , more like a wedding dress and the hip area is huge . It would be a great dress for maternity photos."
1.0,VERY BAD POOR PRODUCT
1.0,they were a big disappointment. So thin you could almost see through them. Not worth it.
1.0,This was not durable at all. 2nd time using both wheels fell off shell completely cracked I can not use at all again. very disappointed.
1.0,Wanted to wear it for Mother’s Day but will have to return it.
1.0,Bad fit hurt my feet only used them in the kitchen and then dug out my old ones
1.0,This rolls up considerably and gets a bit bunched.
1.0,"One of the silver balls, that sits against your earlobe, fell off before I even put it in my ear."
1.0,"We bought this to go to the NFR in Vegas, it did not fit in the Southwest Airlines overhead bin or under the seat. Had to remove the top to fit any where."
1.0,"My husband didn't like how the button area was so shallow, like they skimped on material."
1.0,"Broken also, information above."
1.0,Cheesy thin ugly
1.0,The flag shows all the way through and makes looking out of them horrible
1.0,Cute but runs small. No room for anything(s).
1.0,Low quality arrived ripped at shoulder
1.0,This arrived today with a big glue spot on the shoulder. I will be returning. I haven't even tried it on. The fabric feels crinkly and cheap.
1.0,Does not look like the one in photo!
1.0,"This bra did not fit anywhere near true size. It would cost me more to return it than keep it, so I am gifting it. It is pretty, but I think it would have been better two sizes larger."
1.0,I was not impressed with the quality of this luggage.  I returned this luggage when I found there was no indication of a guarantee of even a manufacturer....just a marketer.
1.0,Total trash. They don't know how to size things properly.
1.0,Too small and too tight had to return
1.0,fit too tight!!  No slot to add the carbon insert K my ńo
1.0,I don't know what or how they base their sizing but I ordered this in a 3X and it would fit my 3 year old niece or my small dog....
1.0,"Sorry, but the build of the dress looks stiff on the bottom.  The top fits okay.  Itdoes not ""sit"" on the bottom so I cut the excess fabric,but still do not like how it came out."
1.0,"I purchases this to keep important documents in I case it ever floods (again) and I have to evacuate through the flood. This is not in any way, shape, form, or fashion waterproof, as stated in the title. There are huge holes by the zipper on both ends and would immediately fill with water if submerged. The outside appears to be vinyl and would protect documents from rain or light weather, but I wouldn't trust it beyond that.<br /><br />The construction seems to be quality but it is totally misrepresented as to what it is."
1.0,Ordered palazzo pants and received harem pants. Not even close. The pants i received have elastic at the foot. Not even close
1.0,Not great quality and overpriced
1.0,Cheap material.  Thin and see through.  Pockets create weird look that could have been avoided if it hadbeen lined.  It looks like a vhild's dress up doctor smock.<br />Returning.  Too ugly to wear.
1.0,Broke the FIRST TIME I WORE THEM
1.0,I chose XL but it's way too small
1.0,The ring is pretty but where the stars are theres black missing like it was scraped off. I didnt pay much but i still expected better quality than this. I bought one like this years ago from a catalog and it was perfect.
1.0,Only two rings fit. The others I had to give to my 8 yr old niece.
1.0,"Color nowhere near the same. Not worth returning, decided to use it as a night gown."
1.0,This item shrank to the size of a toddler shirt when I washed it.
1.0,"Literally how is this supposed to be a dress? I was anticipating it being to small but this? This is a crop top. Not a dress, not an oversized sweater, but a crop top. Im so disappointed and will be returning ASAP"
1.0,"Look really cheap, it’s a shiny plastic look."
1.0,Fits the face weird and kinda gets in your eyes
1.0,This pashmina is not blue grey as advertised. It is decidedly grey. I didn't even open the package. It looks nice if light grey is the color you are looking for.
1.0,"This necklace looked cute online and when it arrived. However, after wearing it twice the necklace clasp started to darken. I gave one as a gift and after the person wore it about 10 times the whole necklace darkened as you can see in the picture. It was embarrassing giving this as a gift! Its too late to return to Amazon...I hope the seller ill make good on this product!!!"
1.0,My daughter used this backpack in less than a month one strap tore and a zipper tore
1.0,wanted to return this dress to get a smaller size but didnt know how since it came directly from China. The quality is fair. It’s sitting in my closet with all the other dresses ordered from China. Amazon should sample the clothes from China before selling to their customers. Most of these dresses are laughable and unwearable. The material is the same as material used for children’s Halloween costumes. What a joke. Real garbage and a waste of money.
1.0,Thin and cheaply made not what I expected
1.0,It a beautiful dress but it way to small. THE SIZE IS OF by 2 to 3 dress sizes
1.0,Color was dull/ugly
1.0,Not as it appears online...looks very cheap & the white stitching doesn't help!
1.0,"Poor quality , the seller wouldn’t make a refund and send me return label!<br /><br />I AM STUCK WITH A DRESS I DON’T WANT!"
1.0,Cheap made chain very small
1.0,They wear already turning copper when I receive them!! Not real 925 silver!!
1.0,Loved the pattern. Didn’t realize it was wrap-a-round.
1.0,"I thought the lace would be super cute but it looks cheap instead.  They fit weird,  not that they run large or small but that they were made for another mammal other than human.  Super disappointed."
1.0,These are very narrow shoes.
1.0,"This looks, feels, & is a cheap imitation of Tiff-Co.  Not sure how it popped up on my search of the real thing but it did.  I don't return thing so I am stuck."
1.0,"I'll first go by saying that I am 5'4"" and 135 lbs, with most of my weight in my thunder thighs and big booty, and I typically wear size small or medium top.  So I ordered a medium, based on other reviews.  Listed below is why I threw this POS in the garbage.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* WRONG SIZE.  I ordered a medium.  I got an XL.<br /><br />* TOO SMALL.  Funny how I received the product two sizes too big yet it is ridiculously small. If that thing I have is a supposed XL them what the heck does a medium look like?  Or a XS? Whoever would fit in the XL does NOT need to be wearing one of these in the first place!  Maybe they meant XL for children!<br /><br />* NAUSEATING STALE CIGARETTE SMOKE STENCH.  Should have known not to buy a fabric-y thing from China, because every fabric-y thing that I've purchased from there smells like it was made in a cigar smoking factory hot box.  Which it probably was.  Nasty. I even washed it to see if the smell would disappear. NOPE.  See my review on the Bluecell Black/Blue/Pink Earphone in-ear Hard Case/Bag Pack of 3: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0AZWPJDFDXU/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EVVMMA&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />* SHIPPING TWICE AS LONG AS OTHER CHINA ORDERS. Took almost 6 weeks to get to me, arrived a couple of day after the delivery estimate.  I knew it was coming from China, but 6 WEEKS?! I have ordered from China a multitude of times and it usually takes half as long.  I wish it just never came so I could get my money back.<br /><br />PROS: NONE.  I hate this thing."
1.0,it runs small and it is transparent the pink one
1.0,"These are an alternative to traditional face masks. I ordered a variety pack ... oops ...nothing like the pictures ... shame on you. Most were dark and creepy (skulls, monster, etc), totally not what a 65+ year old would wear! Only two were light colored.  Oh, well, they'll be set out as freebies for masks/face coverings during the current pandemic"
1.0,very creepy made
1.0,"i only received 1 box, not 3 as advertised."
1.0,The socks are absolutely not the socks they show in the picture. They don’t even look like socks here in America. I don’t know where the socks come from. But every pair of socks are just weirdly made. Spend more money and get something else these are awful
1.0,I received the item and the print is not good. Contacted the seller hoping to hear back
1.0,"Omg this is the most awful shoe. Within about an hour, the ball of my foot and all the way through my arch felt like stabbing explosive pain on the INSIDE of my foot, like within the bones and cartilage, which I’ve never experienced before. I could not walk without almost crying. Yes the shoes have zero arch support (incidentally, most of my shoes don’t have arch support and they feel fine) and are hard and the soles hurt, nothing a gal can’t live with.. but it’s not just because there is no cushioning of any kind that these were so painful, I’m actually not sure the phenomenon here. In addition to being super hard soles and uncomfortable, the pain inside my foot, I assume from a very narrow toe box crushing my metatarsals, was an additional gift from Bandolino House of Pain. It would feel better to walk on concrete than in these shoes. I hobbled to my car and changed into the spare shoes I bring along while breaking in a new pair. Definitely returning."
1.0,I bought this swim wear based on sizing chart and customers review....my bust size is a 36D/DD and it was too big for me.....I wish I had bought a medium....Now I must get it amended at my local dressmaker.
1.0,Pins are too short and can't be switched out. Should have read all the reviews.
1.0,The bag is only 12 inches in height not 15. 3 more inches would have been better. The bag is small and not at all like it looks in the picture. Cheaply made. Doesn’t seem sturdy at all.
1.0,Pants Were way too small for my 7 year old who wears size 7 and is 52lbs
1.0,"Very cheap looking when out on.  And the rod is flimsy, bents easily."
1.0,The stockings were too long for me--modified them & fit better--didn't like the extra thread around circles on inner side but does give good support.
1.0,The letters are already falling off. My son loved this jersey until now. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Love the hat, but the velcro is CHEAP!  Already unusable!"
1.0,"This dress is cheaply made. The button holes weren't big enough to put the button through. If you're patient enough to cut the holes yourself, it may be worth it. But, I feel like that's kind of the manufacturers job. The dress itself is cute, just cheap."
1.0,"Horrible tiny earrings. They arrived late and were broken in the package. Look cheap prob cuz they are cheap. You get what you pay for. These earrings are ridiculously tiny, maybe a little bigger than an ant."
1.0,"The tassel snapped off before I even stepped out of the house. It's amazing, so I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"This product I ordered on March 2, 2022 obviously is a returned one from a buyer because the tag of the product is missing and the product comparing the with wine color which I ordered yesterday March 6, 2022 and delivered to me today March 7, 2022 that very obviously was washed and caused shrink . Today I also order another one with color rose. Actually, I have ordered the product four times in total. I returned the first order which I ordered on October 22, 2021 because the color is not right for my skin.  Please don't cheat to customer."
1.0,This is so thin and so itchy and small it's ridiculous! Worst thing ever
1.0,I couldn’t get them to stick to my Oakly sunglasses long enough to see if the magnification worked.
1.0,I had to return these they would not zip up over my calfs too small. They were prompt and easy to return.
1.0,I never got to wear it.  I bought this with my outfit and put it on and fought with it for almost an hour.  There is a rod on the inside and it expands out with the bracelet but then it gets caught and pops out.  It was just horrible.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!
1.0,Item isn’t sweatshirt material
1.0,Cheap looking. Poorly made. Not at all  the color it was in the pictures
1.0,"It’s pretty but all pieces fell apart when I opened it. They sent a new one and AGAIN, it fell apart immediately!!"
1.0,"Ripped the second I put them on and they’re not even too tight, they’re too big. So why would they rip? Don’t buy these. They feel comfortable but they’re crap."
1.0,Mal fafricado
1.0,"Super cute case, poorly made and unable to use at all. Broke with in an hour and never fit properly."
1.0,No thanks.
1.0,"It was great for the first two or three weeks, then it got thinner and thinner and eventually every pair we bought ripped in the crotch area. Waste of money, I will not be buying these underwear again."
1.0,The style pant I received is completely different than what is pictured.
1.0,I like the design hate that there's no pouch room and rolls up thighs.
1.0,Runs so small.
1.0,"At first, I was very excited about these shoes. But the second time I wore them, the velcro strap no longer held. Now, the strap lets go after two steps. They shoes are a good fit and feel like slippers to wear, so I really want them to work. But I could never recommend them because the strap doesn't stay on. Very disappointed."
1.0,I don't like them.  I think they are to big. They look cheap and ugly.  They look way different in the picture. Sorry.
1.0,I cannot even try this on since I am allergic to polyester. It says 100% rayon - BEWARE LIE ON FABRIC!!!
1.0,Couldn’t get the above me shin. Much to tight on my leg.
1.0,Liked it but it broke while fastening band. Ordered another
1.0,Highly disappointed! I ordered a size bigger based off of other reviews and it was still way too small. It was a Christmas present that I was unable to give because it was so small.
1.0,Ridiculously small<br />Will be sending back
1.0,Pretty bad quality
1.0,Stones missing when it came in
1.0,Broken upon opening
1.0,"When it arrived in the mail, it was completely bent and broken."
1.0,"The shorts fit great and looked very good! I would have loved them if they’d last more than four wears. First time I wore them the stitching in the back right pocket came out, rendering the pocket useless. By the third time, stitching had come out of the right cargo pocket as well.<br />The fourth time the fabric completely separated down the rear. I contacted the seller to see if I couldn’t exchange them for a pair that wasn’t defective as I really enjoyed the look. But I never heard from the seller.<br />Don’t buy these. Spend an extra $5 and get a quality set. These are essentially disposable."
1.0,Broke after less than a week of buying it. Returning it and never buying chains off of amazon again.
1.0,Provided absolutely no benefit for night time glare. Worthless.
1.0,"I purchased shirt.  These shirts are seconds.  Sleeves reached to my knees, tail to my waist."
1.0,They are nice looking and have enhanced viewing - for a couple months. 3rd one in the past year that broke under normal wear and tear conditions.
1.0,Ordered a size medium and they fit like an extra small
1.0,"I got a size too small, which was my mistake, but they expect me to take pictures of the item, packaging, measure it, etc before allowing me to return & replace with a larger size. I don’t have the packaging anymore, I don’t have the patience or time to take pictures & measure before I can get a replacement."
1.0,We bought this for my husbands king of hearts costume. It made him look like a circus ringleader. To top it off it’s cheaply made and feels like a plastic material. 10/10 would not recommend and will be returning.
1.0,Lo dejaron en otra casa he escrito y ni enviaron nuevamente ni me devolvieron el dinero
1.0,Got hosed on this one. Deceptive discription and pictures
1.0,"The picture online makes this top look nice but upon receiving my order , one black and one pink, the material is so thin almost paper thin, so thin that washing it might tear it apart. Hand wash for sure!!  and the fit was extremely smaller than normal. I were a large in tops usually so I ordered an xlarge to be safe. It was still almost too small.  Too bad because the style is perfect for hot weather. I am returning my order!"
1.0,Arms are too big and the body part is way too small. I would not buy this again in any size. Very cheap material.
1.0,The bow is not large like the picture.  It is extremely small.
1.0,"very cheep material it was ripped from the zipper when i got it and ripped from the arm area right away when trying it on  , don’t recommend it"
1.0,Was extremely dissapointed when we got the necklace looks way better in the picture!
1.0,Way to big on the bottom.
1.0,Two stones fell out in the first week! Before returning I e-mailed the company and they offered 50% the purchase of the same ring! SCUMBAGS!
1.0,"Wish I could give 0 stars not only was the ankle broken, but it also was I ordered."
1.0,"Out of all the clothing I have ordered from Amazon, this dress is a 0 out of 10... do not recommend. It looks like a first time sewer crafted it and the fit is terrible even for a unfitted garment. Returning."
1.0,"I wasn't expecting a ritzy watch for the price.  It LOOKS fantastic and sleek.  However, after one wearing the band came ""unglued"" from the watch head (The band folded to make a loop and the loop came unglued) and it wasn't worth the effort to return.  Too bad.  Watch looks great, but the quality of the band was not."
1.0,This shirt is horrible. The print is not even close to being centered on the shirt. The word Woodstock begins in the middle of my chest. People look elsewhere for shirts.
1.0,"Pure Trash, would have expected it if it were kenneth cole. Will try Chinese knock offs in the future."
1.0,This dress is dirty and has a few hole in it. Definitely sending it back.
1.0,Not very good quality.. Thin and cheaply made
1.0,"Cute shoes but terrible quality… After one use one of the rhinestones had fallen off. After several uses, the sole started separating from the toebed and the fabric started looking worn, shaggy and sad… The sparkles are quickly fading. It’s really too bad because this fit well and my daughter loves these shoes, but there are definitely better values out there for the money!"
1.0,"Too small, not accurate sizing"
1.0,Different from picture
1.0,Then material is no good
1.0,"The quality of the material is fine, and I ordered my actual size I wear which is medium and that's fine, but they are short Once you put them on the shirt fell just below my chest.  WHAT! Who would wear a running shirt that falls just below your chest?  Not me!  They got returned as quick as they came in"
1.0,Doesn't stay stuck on. Makes you feel really uncomfortable all day. too bad!
1.0,I had high hopes from this . But it came with stains on it . I would have given it more stars if it wasn’t for the stains. If I can be further helped with the product I’d change my review for it.
1.0,I ordered these and got high tops instead of regular shoes like in the picture. They also are about an inch to large
1.0,I didn't even get all of them. Pretty sad.
1.0,"I ordered these in a size 34-inch waist, which is what I wear. I ordered one blue pair, and one khaki pair. I own numerous pairs of UB shorts, ...all of which are a 34-inch waist. All of my current UB shorts with 34-inch waist tags, are also tagged as; Made in Vietnam.  These UB shorts however are tagged as; Made in China.  I used my wife's fabric measuring tape to verify my suspicions. Measuring the entire waistline of the blue shorts comes out to 31-inches (EVEN THOUGH THE TAG READS 34!).  And measuring the entire waistline of the khaki shorts comes out to 37-inches (EVEN THOUGH THE TAG READS 34!).This must be why these shorts are being liquidated at $12 a pair. Based on the reviews, I am not the only one receiving sizes that are inconsistent. Thank you Amazon for the return for a FULL REFUND. For future buyers, ...BE WARNED. One can only logically conclude at this point that the low price is to liquidate manufacturer defects."
1.0,"When I put the mask strings behind my ears, I heard a snap. The thread broke and the mask came apart. The size is for a child’s face, not an adult."
1.0,Weird material has a plastic feel to it. Sizing is Chinese so super snug and the pocket stitching came undone
1.0,"The shoes are hard to walk in they don't grip the floor they slide around and they are not comfy, they really don't feel good on your feet might as well have socks on"
1.0,I returned this ring 💍 it was not the quality that was pictured.  I was very disappointed when I opened it. Sent it back the next day.
1.0,"I have 3 issues with this ring, listed from least to most important. (Although #3 is all you really need to know... besides DONT BUY IT!)<br /><br />1. Looks Cheap:<br />Looks and feels like the jewelry that you get out of the plastic eggs in the 25 cent grocery store gumball machines.<br /><br /> 2. Poor fit:<br />The shape was poorly cast- not symmetrical & off-round- causes poor fit even with the right size. (Too big in some places, too small in others.)<br /><br />***  3. Uncomfortable/ PAINFULL:  ***<br />While very thin from the top view, it is very thick from the side. It holds your fingers apart with your hand relaxed. And if you try to close your fingers/ squeeze them back together, the ring cuts into them like the blade of a dull knife. Potentially painfull with as little as a firm handshake. BUT DEFINATELY PAINFUL no matter what  from the texturing on the band- it starts to rub your skin raw after wearing it for just a few minutes doing nothing more than using your phone."
1.0,"These just don't look very good, they're really bulky and don't really stay upright because they're heavy. I just can't really wear them."
1.0,This is not a belt. It's a necklace.
1.0,tiny little things... way too small
1.0,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He was unpacking them from the box, and the clip broke. Seems to be cheap. Move on to another product."
1.0,These are a lot smaller than they seem in the photo.  More suited for s child
1.0,The chain faded in to weeks not real sliver poor quality
1.0,"Where can I begin with complaints about this product and seller...this dress is not polyester and spandex, it’s practically sandpaper. The quality is awful and the fit is like a garbage bag. At least a garbage bag would probably be comfortable, and more worth your money. When I contacted the seller for a return/refund they told me they could give me 30% if I ship it back. Really? Terrible return policy that is NOT as advertised where it says the item is returnable. Hopefully filing a claim with Amazon will yield better results, because this is a total scam."
1.0,The pugs were sooooo pink. Very Disappointed :(
1.0,I can't figure out how to return them.  And trying to talk to someone has been impossible.
1.0,"Bought 2 different croc designs, same size. This one too small, the other too big."
1.0,"KNOCK OFF. this should be much thicker textile,<br />Also the stitched design print shouldn't only be on ONE side of the shemagh.<br /><br />Fool me once, fool me twice.. COME ON PEOPLE!!!!<br />This is utter bulls***. It's so hard to find a legit one of these.<br /><br />The textile is see through. if i hold it up i can clearly see whats on the other side.<br />Why? WHYYYYYYY?"
1.0,Badly made
1.0,[[ASIN:B01LX2KW6T Carrie Hughes Steampunk Retro Bronze Mechanical Skeleton Hand-wind pocket watch with chain Gift Box CHPW07]]<br /><br />This pocket watch does not keep accurate time. It will run for a while then it stops. I returned it for credit.
1.0,"Way too tight around the hips, but the top was huge. Maybe better if you are shaped like Barbie, but not for pear shaped athletes"
1.0,In photo it shows zipper in the middle of the tummy.  It is actually on the right side of the stomach and extremely uncomfortable when on.  It's difficult to clasp and the zipper is very hard so it pushed into the skin and leaves ugly marks.
1.0,No good regret buying it no good
1.0,The tree pieces popped off but I should be able to glue them back on.
1.0,Doesn't look like pic
1.0,Broke the very first time I attempted to put these on.
1.0,This mask is no more than a cheap thin plastic Halloween mask that was priced for something that would be more like a ceramic mask that would be an excellent wall decoration. Don't waste your money on this.
1.0,"Super thin plastic,it broke after only one day of having. The plastic is really thin."
1.0,"Was very excited for this vest. However, I opened up the package to try it on and was overwhelmed with a horrible chemical smell. I was disappointed as I purchased to wear for my weekend birthday celebration. But there was no way I was going to put that fabric and smell anywhere near my skin. Definitely plan on returning"
1.0,"Did not look like real fur, poor quality and I returned."
1.0,Have to exchange for a medium because the large is tent-like
1.0,Wasn't what we expected to be like
1.0,"Too cute, I rocked it, however, the Pineapple came off the same day!  I wore a gauze (no type of weight to this) dress, the hem grazed the pineapple, and whoop, off went the pineapple... LIKE WHHHHAAAAA??!! WILL be returning.  2 days in box 2 minutes on, and crack, flip goes the pineapple!"
1.0,"Product is not as seen on the photos. On the bottom stripe, in bold print is ""Made inChina."" There is no way to hide this so beware."
1.0,Freshly trimmed toenail and both socks had holes in the toes within an hour of putting them on. Thin material. Such a waste of money
1.0,This was to be light weight but was heavy on my feet
1.0,Do not buy. Knock off with super small graphics.
1.0,Fabric is thin and feels odd. It’s cheap material. I returned it.
1.0,Very cheap. Pin not very secure. Sent them back as soon as I received them
1.0,I don't care for the way it looks or the way it fits. Material is cheap
1.0,These pants are completely see through.
1.0,The fit was the worst
1.0,Zipper broke off while trying on
1.0,Returned this
1.0,"Aweful dont bother, the sizing is Not EVEN CLOSE. 4X would be lucky to fit a size Medium. So if u really like this shirt go 4 sizes up. Or better yet find something else.."
1.0,Doesn't work or fit my surge
1.0,Low quality dress overall.  The sleeves are barely attached to the dress.  Very unflattering dress.  The front slit stays pretty much closed unless you happen to be walking down a runway or there is a sudden gust of wind.  The overall look is frumpy.  I can't really think of anything positive to say about this dress and I immediately returned it.
1.0,I can’t even wear it because one of the straps is sewn in crooked. I would like to return it for one that is sewn correctly.
1.0,I wanted thinner slides and didn't really mean to get these but have figured a way to use them. Wonder how to fine thinner ones?
1.0,Sash could wrap around waist multiple times.  Did not fit hips..too tight even though I picked bigger size.  Could see all body flaws.  Horrible.  Would not buy from this designer again.
1.0,Didn’t like the fabric. Too small
1.0,"Thin is a understatement, way to small, like the style, but cheap all around.<br />about one size to small. large needs a extra large.<br /><br />If your buffed and want to show off still get a larger size then what you normally wear.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend because of material so thin, and price for the product.<br /><br />Thought I was getting quality ? CHEAP"
1.0,The thigh openings won’t stretch as much as the rest of the panties so they won’t fit  I tried ordering another size up and still the same problem. They would be great if this was fixed
1.0,The printing is crooked and printed on a very sub-par t shirt. You can actually see right through it. I will never buy anything from this company again!!
1.0,"The item is not down.  Very cheap quality.<br />Pockets ill placed. Size was medium not an 8 so the fit was bad, very disappointed."
1.0,"Fits okay, little big in the bottom area and tight in the armpits"
1.0,2 days out of the package the product oxidized
1.0,"Looks cheap. If you only wear silver /white gold, this is not for you. Would prefer to return it, even if it's as cheap as it looks."
1.0,"I was very disappointed that the color ""midnight"" turned out to be dark navy and not black as it appears in the picture on Amazon. Surprisingly there is no black! Otherwise, the trousers would have been perfect."
1.0,I have ordered these 3 times now! The first pair was correct but one post was bent and it came with 2 different backs. The 2nd one came fine but the wrong color. The 3rd one was again the wrong color! More than annoyed now.
1.0,I received totally different glasses
1.0,I ordered a 3X and when I received it they were marked with a 4X and I couldn’t get them up past my knees.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:385861d0d9c8a3d00be0a0a7854427bb]] This is nothing like what they have on the description, what a rip off !!!!"
1.0,Different than the pic. Didn't like it at all
1.0,"Cheap, thin, sleeves are too short and tight at the ends. It is NOT fuzzy on the inside. Very disappointed, especially for the price. Returned."
1.0,"they had spelled hang correctly. You just can't ""hany"" with your dog - which is what the socks say. I am sure the girl won't mind and will wear them anyway. It is unbelievable that they have a spelling error like this on a product that is meant to be worn."
1.0,IT DOES NOT GLITTER! It’s just a piece of material! So disappointed! Don’t buy it.
1.0,"I loved the style and color of this watch! The material felt great, and it looked fantastic for what I paid. Unfortunately, it began to peel within HOURS of use. I couldn't believe it happened so quickly."
1.0,"I'm not going to look up how to make a special knot that makes this work.  That should come with it.  If i get a decent answer and its not a horrible hack this review may change its rating.  Until then this is an unusable product as it will pretty much be for everyone who doesn't want to tie a knot every time they pick up the controller.<br /><br />Where the latch normally is, there is just a plastic rectangle..."
1.0,The dress came missing a strap. Highly disappointed in the quality of this dress.
1.0,the size runs way too small a large would fit a 12 yr old
1.0,"This is the cheapest least quality item you can get.. It was going to be a Christmas present, but I'd be embarrassed to give this to anybody."
1.0,Nice bars but absolutely not 18g. These are standard 16g.
1.0,The sizing is way off. I ordered a XL and they fit like a medium. Also they are pure spandex. Im not happy at all.
1.0,Cheap and poorly made.
1.0,I ordered it October 28th it got here November 25 just under a month to get here. I got it this morning and it's legitimately a black hat with a sticker on it. the decal peeled right off the top of the hat seconds after messing with it. The inside seam is sown with such little material that the thread is about to come out. Keep in mind that I got it 20 minutes ago.
1.0,"I bought the pack of six. Out of the four I have worn, three got runs in them like nylons. All these runs stated in the crotch and went up the front and two went up the rear side. No way of saving them. And I won't even try the last two, I will save my self the embarrassment"
1.0,I really like this dress it fits great everywhere else on the body except in the waist area I have an hourglass figure. I bought and ordered two different dresses and found that they both had the same issue that the waist was way too small for the size secleted (large) I had my 12 year old daughter  try it on  she is a size zero and it could barely zip on her frame. So it's my opion the the garment was not made accurately according to the proper size guidelines.  After all the fuss I finally gave up on the dress or paying to return it a second time.
1.0,"The belts look cheap and plasticky, rather than metallic."
1.0,"These leggings were fabulous when I received them. I got three pairs for Christmas. Each of the three pairs ripped out in the crotch within the first two wears. I'm a size 8, so I'm not over-stretching them by any means. I think it's just very poor quality. If I could return all three pairs and get my gifters their money back I would. But it's now two months later so I'm just warning future buyers"
1.0,Two hours of sledding in these and our fingers were soaked to the bone. These are VERY warm until they get a little moisture on them.  They are NOT waterproof
1.0,3x is more like a smedium (small & medium)...shirt is way to small for musclarification dudes over 220lbs
1.0,"One of the four clips would not hold onto my shirt. Straps are better quality than the cheaper ones, but not the clips"
1.0,My bottoms were actually two front sides sewn together. A little too cheeky for me.
1.0,For the price im not impressed. They ripped within an hour of wearing them for the first time. Keep in kind i ordered them 2 sizes larger then i would if they were american sizes
1.0,Not down filled as advertised
1.0,Nothing the product hasn't even been used tarnished and it is supposed to 18k gold plated thank God I have a second choice for what I was supposed to use it for
1.0,Sure it looks cool in the picture but it is a soft rubber mask and the cord and battery pack come out of the side of the mask. VERY noticeable and uncomfortable. Very slim field of view through a small hole.
1.0,"It is unattractive and small and flimsy in appearance, it does not reflects the price"
1.0,Ordered XL (16/18) and my 13 year old of average build could barely even get one on.
1.0,"Was disappointed in the bracelet.  When I ordered thought I was getting only the charm and thought the charm was in color (red, white, blue)  What I got was a whole bracelet and charm and all was gold."
1.0,Too much padding and very awkwardly shaped. Returning.
1.0,This was very cheaply made. The Mexico flag is a tiny sticker and the metal is flimsy.
1.0,No me agrado ni la calidad ni el tamaño
1.0,Shirt Was not true to size
1.0,Junk! I bought three watches that did not work.
1.0,Very disappointed this hat was meant for a adult but it's even to small for a child . This is a shame to sell a product without knowing whom it would fit a child or adult . This is false advertisement at its best . I'm also dissapointed with Amazon as well I purchase a lot a lot of products from Amazon and this is the first time I was this upset and unhappy with a item . This was a Christmas gift and I'm not spending any more money to correct this issue 😡 it really deserves a half star if at all.
1.0,"I really wanted these jeans to work out- I love the butterflies!! I have tried 2 sizes of this item. Both pairs had the same problems-the cut is just wrong. The zipper is very noticeably off center when zipped. The waist to crotch length is too short. It REALLY cuts into the crotch area. Everywhere else is a bit baggy-thighs, butt, ect. The fitment problems were just to much, so both pairs were returned."
1.0,Not worth the price. I felt it was not very well made.  Your better off going to TJ maxx or Marshalls to get better quality item.
1.0,"The embellishment under the breast came off 15 mins after i put the dress on for the wedding i was in! The dress fits very big, so i suggest ordering 2 sizes smaller then what you normally wear! I was very very upset two of the loops for the corset were missing and the dress had a horrible smell upon receiving!"
1.0,The item does not look like what on the picture on the website it look inferior
1.0,Back pocket ripped badly already exposing my underwear...  I missed the return window by one day.
1.0,Size chart is like for little girl. Very stiff material too looks like it was made with cardboard paper because it’s stiff and doesn’t flow
1.0,"REALLY wide and about a whole size too long.  It is a shame, because they are adorable looking shoes."
1.0,Did I really....I can't believe what drinking can do to you
1.0,I had the bracelet less than a day and it fell apart. It happened when I was standing in the grass in the dark and we could never even find the pieces to fix ir return it. I was so mad!!
1.0,Necklace came in broke and it's not returnable.  So I paid for a broken necklace I can not wear.
1.0,"The material was very stiff and cheap feeling. It did not sit the way it looked like it would. When it was on, it looked more like a queen of hearts costume."
1.0,"El reloj que llego a mi casa la correa no corresponde , si observa la imagen del pedido es diferente al que llego. Javier Rosas (cliente Amazon)"
1.0,The clip broke immediately with a spring coming out.  I tried to get a refund but never received a reply.  Don't buy this product.
1.0,My regular size is XL And this XL shirt is huge ! Don’t recommend it !
1.0,"The price tempts you to buy them, but the quality is just too low"
1.0,"Expensive and very thin, i thought they would keep my 3 months old grandson feet warm but have to put another pair of socks underneath"
1.0,I can't believe these are night vision lenses. If they are polarized then it is the poorest process. All it does is change white light to yellow. I still get glare from the oncoming headlights. The only thing they might help with is the reflection of light you get from your side view mirrors. These glasses do come from China so the delivery is at least 3 weeks. Coming from China also explains the poor polarized process (if any). Stay away from this product.
1.0,"A little too small for size. Also, the tulle was very itchy, and felt very cheap."
1.0,The band has stitching on the inside that becomes very scratchy after only a few minutes. At least for me personally.
1.0,This product is an extremely poor quality fabric and sewing. It is not a gaiter or even a large scarf but a ridiculously thin face mask (2 layers of thin polyester fabric) with a scratchy polyester hanging from it.  Look at the other's photos- it's not large enough to tie behind your head to look like a scarf.  I'm returning.
1.0,I don't know where these were manufactured but they are no where need a 3xl. If they are even a large I would never surprised.
1.0,"First, the good:<br /><br />1.  They arrived very quickly (although I'm sure that has something to do with the fact that they shipped from LA and I live in California).<br />2.  They look good.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Now, let's talk about the bad:<br /><br />1.  The very first thing I do when I get any new pair of boots or shoes is to remove and inspect the insole.  In this case, calling it an insole is an exaggeration.  At the heel, there is all of about 2mm worth of padding, while the rest is little more than a super-thin layer just barely enough to hold a shape.  The padding at the heel was poorly attached to the rest of it, so that it was misaligned.  And there is absolutely zero arch support.<br />2.  They are way too small.  I have slightly wide feet, so I generally prefer to order boots and shoes in an E or wider width when possible.  That is not possible with these boots, so in such cases, I normally order one full size larger.  Reviews elsewhere suggested these might be a bit on the small side, so I ordered 2 full sizes larger this time.  I normally remove insoles in order to replace them with superior arch supports, and I have a high instep, so I need extra room at the instep for a good fit.  These boots, at 2 full sizes too big, would fit fine if I didn't have wide feet and used absolutely no insole at all, but as soon as I put in an insole with anything resembling actual arch support, they were way too tight at the instep, and they were always too narrow at the metatarsal heads (the balls of my feet).<br />3.  Because of the narrow gusset at the side zipper, combined with the fact that the gusset goes all the way to the top, even with bungee laces these are difficult to put on without loosening the laces, which rather defeats the purpose of having a side zipper.<br />4.  The side zipper has no mechanism to lock it into place in the zipped position, so that over time the zipper works its way open all on its own, just from normal walking, at a rate of about 1 inch per 5 minutes (so that they are fully unzipped within about 40-45 minutes).<br />5.  The way the gussets of the tongue are put together puts them in direct contact with the boot laces, so that over time I fully expect the laces would abrade straight through the gussets, thus almost certainly reducing the overall durability of the boots (this is untested by me, as I'm sending them back right away).<br /><br />...<br /><br />Needless to say, these boots are being returned for a refund."
1.0,There was a hole in the armpit area . Very cheaply made
1.0,"I purchase this dress based on the reviews, and that was a bad decision. I wear a medium so base on the reviews I decided to go with a small. one word WOW!!!! and I don't mean that in a good way. The small could have fit myself and my three siblings. the material is garbage, cheap, and looks like old piece of drape they took from a window, put together, and called it a dress. I am no model, nor do I have a model shape but I have curves and this did absolutely NOTHING for my body.....So I GLADLY return."
1.0,These earrings were supposed to be red hearts and they came in a reddish brown color and both posts were completely flat they could not be worn and were very low quality I did return them
1.0,"The ""u clip"" on these earrings breaks very easily, they did not last me two years and the vendor felt that this was acceptable. I don't think 14k jewelry should break in two years."
1.0,"Dress was ill fitting (although it DID have pockets) - torso was super short but not quite an empire waist so it landed funny on stomach - neckline had a 1"" interior hem not stitched down, so it kept popping out - material was scratchy. Product met requirement of a ""one wear"" item for a fun/silly holiday event. If you are purchasing as a nice dress - save your money."
1.0,"Runs very, very large."
1.0,These pajama bottoms had holes in the crotch before they were even worn! Very disappointed!
1.0,"This is definitely not a small.  Even though the tag in the vest states small, it is the exact same size as a medium that I was trying to replace. Now I have two vests that are too big."
1.0,Ordered this dress for my daughter's first pageant. The dress came today and looks nothing like the picture. There is literally only 1 layer of tulle and no poofyness to the dress whatsoever. Tried to fluff out to see what it would look like with a petticoat underneath...the front is cut too short....it sticks straight out. Seems like the skirt in the front starts too high on my daughter's torso. If I could give ZERO stars I would!
1.0,made in china
1.0,The levers on these broke once I got them.  I never even wore them.
1.0,the size guide is wrong. it fits too tight. i threw away the packaging and can't return it. wasted $40+.
1.0,"Do not buy these pants they are a joke. The material very thin and light, not durable at all, stitching has lose ends everywhere. They are no more durable than a pair of scrubs. Sizes are not very close to what you would expect from a quality pair of pants."
1.0,"For the money, it’s what I expect...cheap fabric. But it’s cute. Now only if I could wear it! It came with 2 left breast ties!!!"
1.0,"Too small, I ended up giving them to my daughter who is 10 sizes smaller than me."
1.0,I ordered this dress in Large and it was extreme small.
1.0,"don't waste your money, this does not protect your eyes from the sun."
1.0,it broke 2 hours later
1.0,"Okay do not expect what you see picture at all. The top and bottoms do not match. The prints are completely different, which is VERY irritating. I ordered a Medium assuming since it came from China that it would still probably be a little tight.... low and behold the top is HUGE (I wear 32B). Its not worth sending back and trying to deal with returning it at this point, but buyer beware. The bottoms do fit well, but I am a bit more bottom heavy than the average female."
1.0,"Be sure to read the description. These are tiny. Worst of all, they are supposed to be real malachite stones, but you can see where the PLASTIC pour runs up over and covers the edge of the silver. The picture shows a very deep green stone. Hard and highly polished. What I recived was a milky green plastic that could not be highly polished and so has a dull sheen. They would have been cute and classy, but just look cheap. Very disappointed."
1.0,The jewel in the top ball came off when I screwed the ball on for the first time. I am really upset because I think it is adorable. I guess I got what I paid for.
1.0,"I was really excited for these pants however I am never going to buy sweatpants off of amazon again this scarred me!! They're built like clothes from SHEIN that are way less expensive than these. I am very disappointed, if I could get my money back I would. Do NOT waste your time on these!!"
1.0,The stone on the flower petals are missing. It came more than a month later
1.0,The lenses popped out right away. Explains why they are so cheap.
1.0,"This is more a review on the seller than the pants. The pants may be great! I received these today on Christmas Eve, a gift for my son. I opened a large box with a pair of khaki snow pants that were stuffed inside a plastic zip bag that was too small so they were extremely wrinkled with the legs cuffed up approx. 8-10 inches. Not a big deal but just another questionable thing leading to the kicker. There weren't any tags attached on the pants which made me wonder what the heck...... The worst part of this order is that there are TWO STAINS in the crotch area, plain as day. Evidently the seller thought it would be okay to send me a $70.00 pair of used pants. These will be going back and I will order from a different seller!"
1.0,This definitely could not have been a 3x in women’s. It was a medium at best.
1.0,i recieved this and it looked absolutely nothing like the picture. also it didnt fit and broke within the first day.
1.0,The sparkling part of the band is falling apart after 2 weeks of wearing it
1.0,The nose piece is not on the top part of the mask it is more so in the middle making the mask unusable. To make the nose wire work you block part of your vision from the mask being so high up.
1.0,Poor Material and fit!
1.0,"Came with an obvious crack at the thinnest part of the band, snapped in half almost immediately. Returned that one, got a replacement. Wore the replacement a couple days before it developed a crack in the same spot. Returned it and bought something else."
1.0,Buy the more expensive one. It's garbage. Bad color. Bad smell. They literally sent 2 trying to get it right and didn't ask for them back. I donated them.
1.0,Sizing way off. This is made for 12 year old body. Definitely not a curvy one. Also cheap material and see through.
1.0,This item was supposed to be a 5x but would be surprised ifit was an xlg. Way too small for me.
1.0,"Shirt was cute and fit nice, however after only 2 washes the bottom hem is coming unraveled. Not worth the $ even tho it was already low priced."
1.0,not happy with it speaker wont stay in place has small Velcro dot that keeps coming off
1.0,Shoe chains are cute but they have to be put together.
1.0,"I found no arch support at all.  The insole is absolutely flat, and has not a bit of flexibility anywhere.  They made my feet hurt, and I couldn't walk in them for any length of time.  I was terribly disappointed and I am returning them."
1.0,"Estamos muy decepcionados por la compra de este reloj, vino con las agujas paradas y no se puede configurar la hora, intente devolverlo y al final mi esposo dijo que lo iba mandar a reparar porque la ilusión de mi hijo era recibirlo este día domingo 15 de marzo."
1.0,I didn’t even get all my piercings jewelry
1.0,Pilling terribly.  I can’t wear in public— the pilling is awful. Never again. Surely would lik a refund.
1.0,poor quality stitching. The item came with a random stitch joining the crotch with the knee. I tried to pull the stitch and it left a hole in both places.
1.0,I wasn't enthused with this product. The bottoms are oddly shaped. They fit loose and I went a size down. The top however fit my breast perfectly.
1.0,No resivi mi paquete lo entregaron en una dirección incorrecta
1.0,The clasp broke within 3 weeks
1.0,This bracelet is a piece of crap..I wore it once and it fell completely apart!! A total waste of money!!<br />If you're thinking about purchasing this bracelet..DON'T DO IT !!!
1.0,"I am not obese but I’m also not tiny. I’m a weightlifter with B cups and a little pudge on my belly. I ordered a large and apparently the designers think that means large boobs and tiny every thing else???? It’s tight on my stomach and hips and way too big on the chest. Not attractive. Not even comfortable.  Unless you are small everywhere but your boobs, don’t bother."
1.0,Gloves are beautiful and appear to be made of good material as the stitching is still in place after 1 week of use.<br />The padding on the other hand is too thin for me. I think these gloves could go a lot farther with thicker gel padding.
1.0,Completely different color and overall look.
1.0,"as someone that's never really had a reaction to body jewelry before, these absolutely destroyed my nose. I cleaned them before inserting and after about an hour the whole side of my nose felt tender and got red. taking it out was a nightmare since the skin around the piercing was already irritated enough.<br /><br />I've had my nose pierced for over 10 years at this point and oof this was a let down."
1.0,Poorly made ripped when first put them on and they were not too small.
1.0,"Too small !!! The size estimation is based on very tiny people ( liliput's type,maybe). I ordered a XXXL its about 3 sizes too small, I am 240 pounds, 6.1 tall.<br />Do not make the same mistake I did. Over all the jersey its self is very nice, good  materiel and pretty nice design. too bad."
1.0,"Poor quality, looks misshapen, like a bag. Not at all what’s in the photo."
1.0,Poor quality. Don't bother.
1.0,Looks nice but buckle broke on the first day.
1.0,I have 42 in waist in the belt supposed to be 48 in and it's too small either mark wrong or defective item!!
1.0,"The image does not match the product that arrived. The hat I received was a much darker royal blue and darker yellow-gold. The image displays a lighter blue and yellow, but that is not what you will receive. False advertising"
1.0,These are terrible. They feel like kids sunglasses. Save your $$$
1.0,Very cheap and plastic-y
1.0,"I wear an XS in leggings, joggers, most all clothing. Was recommended to buy an XS in this product but I wanted a baggier fit so I opted for a S. They’re skin tight, like exactly the same fit as leggings.<br />Poor sizing aside, the material is strange and has weird restricting seams on the waistband.<br />Pick another brand"
1.0,Really poor quality material. I ended up returning it.
1.0,Fell apart in 1 week.
1.0,"Received a “genuine” leather belt not the full grain leather that was advertised. Genuine leather is leather dust glued together, not quality leather and not what I ordered"
1.0,Product not well made. Stitching does not hold up. Wish I would have known and could have at least returned.
1.0,These socks felt and looked great before wearing. These pictures are from my son wearing them for a few hours. They are now covered in fuzz and look terrible. Very poor quality
1.0,"These look like nice socks that would compliment my kid’s outfits quite well.  However, I bought them largely due to the supposed inclusion of nonslip features.  There aren’t any!!  If you have hardwood floors, look for different socks."
1.0,"Let me just say, I have a bit in the gut dept. I am usually a 2XL guy. I love tanks in the summer and went with a 3XL to have a little play. The shoulder cut was I was looking for. This tank was so tight I could not believe this was a 3XL. It fit more like a regular 1XL. They must be on the Abercrombie curve. Not a bad shirt, cotton as what I wanted. Any bigger guy out there looking for a summer tank this is not it!!! Trust me on this. Thank you Kohls for the return policy arrangement with Amazon for returns. To big imshape guys, may work well. Guys with a little something in the waistline stay away like the plague lol"
1.0,"Not as expected, very thin, cheaply made"
1.0,"So I should of known, I measured myself twice bc china never gets the product size right. And ordered the size closest to my measurments, they were slightly over what I am, well they are way too big and way too short. I figured I could take them in but the inseam is way to short. Only 22 - 24 inches, cant lenghten pants. But thats because I have a 36 inch inseam. So if you are short this is the product for you. One day theyll make things like this for big and tall girls. Or maybe ill be better at sewing."
1.0,The only thing you can see are oncoming lights.  I almost missed a stop sign.  A complete waste of money.
1.0,I Oder a xl and was too too small
1.0,"Ordered these, came broken, ordered a replacement, broken again... they're beautiful, but do I want to keep trying!?! Packaging is a very flimsy box, no wonder they'll all broken."
1.0,Not well made - weird material.  Lacy was all tore up.  Don’t buy - you have to ship back yourself out of country!!! Ridiculous-
1.0,"Beautiful summer tops but way too small, I bought a medium, my normal size but this fits my daughter who wears a XXSML."
1.0,Very disappointed with this dress. It looked better online on other’s pictures than it did when I put it on base on the size suggested by website. The chest area was too tight and neckline was choking my neck when I did manage to close it off.
1.0,"Not true to size, way too larger than shown on the pictures. Too big and no tags to determine front from back"
1.0,Same length as a regular dress shirt. Definitely not’untucked’
1.0,I was so happy when I received my daughter's adorable sneakers because they looked exactly as advertised. The only problem is the Velcro never stays attached. I put the sneaker on my daughter and they come right off because they won't stay secured. She wore them outside so I didn't feel comfortable returning them after she wore them.
1.0,"These are awful, they don't work as underwear worn against the skin.  The ridges on the padding dig into the delicate tissue.  Ouch."
1.0,The one star is for the only honest part of the listing... an unheated opal would technically be... a rock.<br />THIS IS NOT AN OPAL. ITS A ROCK.
1.0,Don't buy this mask.  It is as thin as a pair of panty hose.  No protection at all!
1.0,Too small. I need a 3 x
1.0,This belt does not fit a size 14 or over unless you want extreme muffin tops.
1.0,"Avoid. First, the one of the velcro pieces was only sewn on one side, I fixed it. However the pads quality is so bad that after 4 weeks of use they are hairy and don't hold anymore. Looks like this pans are especially made for wardrobe malfunction. The fabric pills like there is no tomorrow. After first wash looks like decade old. One of the zipper loops is not holding anymore, I had to fix the tab by bending it twice.<br />Pros: quite comfortable, although narrower than expected."
1.0,The Material was way too thin see-through super cheap and did not look as expected.
1.0,Cute bathing suit … size is not true… would need 2x more than the size you do wear
1.0,Seriously whoever designed and sewed this should quit this profession. These shirts can't be worn because the front and back are identical. So you'll always look stuffed in the front and totally misplaced in the back.
1.0,"One of the pockets was sewn in backwards and the upper half of the outfit isn’t proportional to the length of my trunk so it pulls down around the neck and shoulder area. The fabric feels cheap and is thin. Not a good fit or a good look, very disappointed."
1.0,The inside zipper was broke when my daughter opened the wallet yesterday on her birthday.. the pull part is completely missing.. not happy
1.0,"Unfortunately, the negative reviews on this one are accurate. Immediately upon putting these on, you can see what appears to be holes in the finger webbing. The stitching is not well done. Additionally, they did not work well on a smartphone. I was having to tap 2, 3, 4 times for my phone to register a touch. I had to press unnaturally hard to actually type anything. I've owned other touchscreen compatible gloves and don't recall experiencing this problem. These are poor quality gloves. I returned them."
1.0,"I followed the size chart and ordered a 7XL (my normal size is 2XL). It fits perfectly at first, but after one summer of swimming, it became so long that it looked like a shin length skirt. The color faded significantly, from a black and white pattern to a light gray. Very unbecoming! I've never a a swimming suit that changed shape and faded as such. Now I must shop for a new one after only a couple of months."
1.0,"Packaging was awful and 3 of them were stained. I am trying to wash them, as we really need them, but seriously, not a good impression. Dont waste your money."
1.0,"The bracket does not fit any mask, I’ve tried them with the medical disposable masks and with the cloth masks. Very disappointed."
1.0,The jacket style and quality were fine but fit is very small!  I ordered larger than I wear and it was still too small.
1.0,"Super cute but only 2 pairs kind of stay up. It’s annoying. I’d send back, but I’ve wore the pair with the bow and it’s not worth it tonsend it back. They just slip and roll down. Highly disappointed."
1.0,Seam torn after one wash and not even one time wearing.
1.0,"This watch is not waterproof. This watch is not  water resistant.  After almost 2 months of light, casual use water seeped into the watch and destroyed it.  Amazon needs to review their policy of only allowing a 30 day return window,  especially  when a product is defective and does not work as advertised.  Amazon needs to have a minimum of 90 day return window, matching brick and mortar stores, to allow a defective misadvertised item to be returned."
1.0,Had to return.  Ordered my normal size large and this shirt was too tight.  Also laundering instructions are very tedious.
1.0,I liked the color and the  feel of the strap but unfortunately I had to return the product due to the band being too long.  It is the length of the large strap and for those of us with smaller size wrists the small fits better. Wish it gave the option for small or large
1.0,"I should have sent this back, but I didn't.  It is so cheap.  I doubt I ever wear it."
1.0,Useless for a reading glass. I have to raise my head at 45 degree to read anything.  May be good for some safety glass usage.
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture. It’s just a tank top
1.0,Would not recommend. Terrible quality materials used and if that doesn’t point you away make sure to size up like 2 or 3 sizes so it fits.
1.0,It was not made very well it been the first day I put it on not happy
1.0,First off this shirt was all polyester I know it says cotton blend if there’s any cotton in it it might be like 5% cotton and 95% polyester it does not hang off your shoulder I wear a large in women’s they sent me a 2X large and it was almost too small that was the first time I’ve ever bought clothes off of the Internet and I promise you I’ll never buy no more clothes off the Internet unless I know for sure for a fact they’re what they say they are!
1.0,SO disappointed! These are cute...but I was looking forward to them being linen pants. No label. Feel like polyester.
1.0,I’ve worn it for 2 days now and the B Initial has broken off and the links are changing color not even good costume jewelry
1.0,"Dress was very low quality material, only resembles pictured item. Cheap course cotton material that is stiff as a board and doesn't flow at all. Picture makes you think it sits well and flows, but that is not that case at all. Returned immediately."
1.0,"It can't hold a charge and can't recharge only after a couple weeks of use. Defective product, don't recommend"
1.0,The socks came dirty (green/neon color on white!) and with black human hair inside a sealed box! It’s terrible and to go through the hassle to return it .. disappointed really
1.0,They looked fine until my daughter put them on and there were steaks all over them! Horrible quality. Had to go to Target to pick some up.
1.0,0 stars it came with a big hole
1.0,"I was looking forward but came to find out that it’s too small, I was soooo bummed out!"
1.0,"My wife really wanted to love this suit but the bottoms are too small, the top is too big and the material is well put together. Will be sending back tomorrow."
1.0,"I was so excited for my new toe socks. They're so big the heel goes up past my ankle. My last 2 small toes barely fit in them as they have so much space. Huge disappointment. I have very wide feet as well as long. Not to mention they're advertised as ""no show"". Thumbs down. These are no good"
1.0,Omg this was half the size of my pinky. Just crazy
1.0,Poor workmanship. I bought this for my wife and we were disappointed on receiving it. Stitching of the top is really poor. Could see threads popping out of stitching at many areas of top including buttons. In all a poor quality with low quality material used. Giving one star as fitting was as per the size chart mentioned with item description.
1.0,"it said it was Swiss Brand! I assumed it was a Swiss made watch!!<br />When I opened it, it said made in China! I sent it right back because I wanted a Swiss made watch! Not more crap from China!"
1.0,Shirt wa ripped.
1.0,The quality wasn't what I expected.  Very small
1.0,My 8 month yellow lab ripped this apart in a week. Don’t buy if your dog chews through everything. Won’t last
1.0,It was small in some areas and big in others. It was a horrible buy.
1.0,"I've had these reading glasses for a few months, and they broke. I'm going to contact the seller for a replacement or refund. We'll see what happens next!"
1.0,"After only 3 trips, weight not exceeding 45 lbs, this's how your front wheels are gonna look like. The main problem isn't wheels, but that now the suitcase is open because cheaply made plastic felt off from the suitcase with a wheel. Pure garbage."
1.0,Although this item fit (more or less) the loops on the suit are too large and the hooks on the straps don't stay on!  The bottom isn't hemmed--just cut...or hacked.  I'm returning this item.
1.0,"They are cute, small and flimsy.  I had to throughout the day readjust them to my lobe."
1.0,The buckled lock can't be closed properly... The material looks almost like nylon!!! Low quality even for the low price... Very disappointed 😕
1.0,It arrived broken at the base.  Cracked off
1.0,"Doesn’t look like photo, weird material and the sleeves are awkward."
1.0,"This is just a plain beanie.  No lining, no layers, just a plain beanie.  I’m calling Amazon to complain.  I should have read the reviews first.  Do Not Buy!"
1.0,Cheap n broke apart same day and I couldn’t get a refund beyond pissed
1.0,No good!
1.0,Nothing like the picture... The material was so cheap and light that it felt like clothes from a doll. It literally feels like wearing a bag with elastic at the top. Very unflattering!!
1.0,"I loved the jewelry. Unfortunately, the wires that suspend the birds is too thick to go through a normal-sized pierced ear. I never wore them.  Sad Purchase."
1.0,It fits very long. Past my butt. I’m 5’10. Cheaply made as well.
1.0,I should have listened to the previous  reviewers ... not just small but TINY. The XXL is what I think of as Medium to Small. Disappointed!
1.0,"I’ve purchased many pairs of elastic shoelaces, however this was my first time purchasing from this brand. I was very displeased with the style and shape of the T-ends, as they were extremely thick and difficult to work with. They did not easily fit into the eyelets of a standard pair of Reebok running shoes. After i finally got one end in, i decided there was no way they would work with the rest of the eyelets and tried to remove it. It was even harder to remove from the shoe, and i almost damaged my shoe in the process.<br />I am extremely disappointed with this product and would urge other buyers to consider a different design from another brand. Highly disappointed."
1.0,"Gloves kept me warm. That was never the issue. But if you need any dexterity with your fingers, these are not the gloves. If you mean to ride with these gloves, my recommendation is that you don’t."
1.0,Asian sizes and very poorly made.
1.0,"I ordered a size up as most suggested, the top is barely adjustable... As in when adjustments are fully slid down it fizes maybe a half inch... And even when hair tied snug the black material loks nothing like photo's. Will be returning..."
1.0,As soon as I took the earring out of the packaging the gem fell out and I lost it... because it's so tiny... waste of money. Wish I never purchased this.
1.0,This thing is so tight. There was no way I could use it. And I got an xl and I'm really not that big. I thought I was going to have to use scissors to cut it off.
1.0,Broke the first time he wore it
1.0,"Super cheap, odd shape and just bad."
1.0,"This is horribly made, super cheap, see through and the clasps on the top don’t even stay together, so as soon as you try to wear it it just falls off.<br />It does look like the photo but mine did not come with a belt, really wanted to like this but it’s really bad quality. So I will be returning it ASAP!"
1.0,Not supportive or tight enough. Non-refundable item.
1.0,"Why is it so hard to make a decent tank, that holds it shape and doesn't shrink like the devil???"
1.0,Does not look like the picture it’s a very very flat cost I’m thinking of sending it back
1.0,washed horrible
1.0,"Ordered XXL, it like a small.  I'm greatly disappointed.  Amazon has really fallen in the past year."
1.0,I ordered a large and it fit like a medium They had no option for XL …
1.0,Way to small for a xxl
1.0,Not durable. She's had these less than a month and they're falling apart. Literally
1.0,They were junk. Wouldn't open enough to put in your ear without breaking. Threw them in trash within 10 min of opening them
1.0,"nice piece but too yellow in color, and fades quickly"
1.0,fell a part and rusted
1.0,Bad fabric.
1.0,Not as supportive as I thought
1.0,my mom is unsure about how to put them on. she said she didn't like them.
1.0,The crown does not work you can’t even adjust the time. Waste of money
1.0,I am super disappointed in this product. What I received did not look like the picture at all and one of the backs to the pin doesn’t lock so it fell off as soon as I put it on and won’t stay. I would not buy this again.
1.0,The fabric is thin like linen and see through. Definitely not what’s depicted in the pictures.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Way too big.
1.0,The robes are too small. How do I send them back and to what address
1.0,"Broke within 3 days of receiving. Super comfy and loved the product but it broke so fast only got to wear it a few days. The little screws fell out and black band that connects to watch itself broke … not sure why! Super sad, not worth it."
1.0,Took way to long to get product.<br />Was not make good .<br />Cheap looking
1.0,No way they can stay on your nose.  Totally useless.  Sent them back
1.0,This should be for your 4 or 5 year old.  It's tiny...I'm in my 30's and thought it was a nice chunky necklace...I can't even fit it around my neck and the beads are 1/4 the size I thought they were.
1.0,had to give it to my friend because it was too small
1.0,"Rips way too easily, won't stay up on the thigh for a long time. Kept having to pull up."
1.0,"Colors are tackier than expected and a Stone was already missing, not even loose in the bag."
1.0,"a Christmas gift for my mother, was highly disappointed in the quality, strings/threads everywhere. The sewing on the hems were shabby. I had to cut and trim all the excess threads off the robe... would not recommend this item."
1.0,I was so excited to receive this dress and it arrived with a rip in the seam down the back.
1.0,"No quality, garbage bag<br />Come with no sticker usa flag and NO<br />Thick shoulder pad design also come with<br /> a blue stain.. THIS IS A FRAUD"
1.0,"Carefull, these pants run very small. I’m a size 29-30 and I sized up just in case (I bought LARGE) and they were way too tight and almost Capri length. They also were practically a jegging fabric and I was worried about the zipper and button closure not lasting."
1.0,"This lighter gets one star for concept. In concept it is sleek, innovative and just cool. It will make a nice decorative accent on my bookshelf for that is all it is good for. I received this lighter a year ago after much anticipated excitement. Boy was I disappointed. It lights one in 15 clicks, the flame is so small it wouldn't warm an ant, which makes it pretty much worthless. Do yourself a favor and buy a box of matches..."
1.0,These were a total miss on me.  I put them right into the donate bin.  The crotch is sooooo long it came to my knees.  I would have had to pull these over my breasts to make them look normal at the waist.  The fabric was ok. Not see threw and on the softer side.<br /><br />I am 5'5 and 155lbs for reference.  Normal size torso and legs.
1.0,The fabric is cheap and costumey. It's not a flattering cut or fabric so it hangs awkwardly.
1.0,Way more yellow than it appears in the picture which was a downer for me since I was looking for more of a soft gold color.
1.0,Good luck squeezing into this if you’re over 100 lbs and have breasts.
1.0,One clasp was broken and they are way too big for ankle bracelets. I hooked into the shortest I could make it and it still fell down into my shoe.
1.0,Item came on time but item had scratches on side very poor sales ethics
1.0,"**update; the watch lasted about a month before the internal parts malfunctioned<br /> This was a nice watch. It is as described in the add and keeps time well. It is a little fast, maybe a minute or two over a week. It is built quite well and all the visible components are attractive, to include the band. The color of the bezel does not match the face. The bezel is a solid color and the face is glossy metallic. I switched to a NATO band only because the micro adjustment is very difficult. With patience and some good reading glasses you can adjust it to the millimeter but it will challenge your skills and patience. The band clasp has very sharp corners that can be sanded for a few dollars at your local jeweler. Overall very nice and attractive with solid well built components. I would buy this again."
1.0,"Do NOT order!!! No way is this the same as the picture. The pic shows: small armholes, more coverage on the back, wider shoulder straps.  What I received: NOT the pic."
1.0,"So, after reading the reviews, I took a chance on getting an undamaged pendant. I knew from the photos I would be replacing the chain and I was ok with that. Instead I am returning the necklace because the picture under the dome is slightly different from what is shown in the description (smaller, blurry, no shield) and the filigree crescent is bent and wonky. Best of luck to you if you decide to gamble on this item. You may get a keeper."
1.0,Extremely unflattering.
1.0,This is a horrible product.  Followed the instructions to size and the rope/band will not go back into the clasp.  Now that it's been cut cannot return so just out the money.  This shouldn't even been allowed to be sold on Amazon.
1.0,"The color is not orange, more of a neon red/orange. The material feels somewhat similar to the napkins that you get at a fancy steakhouse. The buttons are a weird cream color. The straps are not adjustable and gave no support."
1.0,"Lens don't fit right in frame. They have too much play. Glasses are too light weight so they move too much when active. Would not purchase again, even for the low price."
1.0,Not the same tank as pictured.<br />Not a true tank. Neck line is way different.
1.0,"Neckline is messed up, threads sticking out all over it."
1.0,This shoehorn is way too heavy!
1.0,"flimsy, small, no nose bender"
1.0,Had to return.  Very small.
1.0,Did not like at all material is cheap
1.0,I needed to return these pants didn’t love the color however the company will only give a shipping label I have to pay for then they will reimburse you to send it back to china or they will give you 50% of your cost and you keep the item
1.0,"A large is a small , could not fit in it to savre my soul."
1.0,"6,3... XX-l was too small"
1.0,"I always carry a pair of clip on sunglasses in my purse for my husband in case he forgets his prescription sunglasses.  His current pair is scratched, so, I ordered to pair of eyekeepers.  They measure the same size as my husband's old pair of clip ons (that we bought in a drug store), but the spring mechanism does not work well and they do not stay on the glasses!  Very disappointing."
1.0,"I bought this for my wife, shes only worn it twice and its already coming apart at the seems, she can no longer wear it and im unable to return it.  I recommend you stay away from this item."
1.0,The watch stopped working after two days. The digital display showed partial time/digits. Very dissatisfied and waste of money.
1.0,The sound quality is barely Audible and extremely too small. Plus the seller ignores messages and or correspondence. Dont buy from these people
1.0,I was expecting bright rainbow colors like in their pictures. I got an ugly color. Not worth gifting.
1.0,They're not loose fit at all. They're tight. And get tighter after washing them.
1.0,I'm extremely disappointed in this product. The material is not supportive at all. You can't waist train with this!
1.0,After one washing all of the stitches around the neckline started coming undone. It’s unwearable.
1.0,After an exhange I sent it back for a refund. Bad quality and cheap.
1.0,"DO NOT ORDER! This is a cheap knockoff and came from overseas. It is basically a piece of decorative paper glued inside a cheap, clear case.  The worst part is, the paper doesn't even run to the edge of the case. What a waste of money!"
1.0,These would not even close when I got them.  Nothing like throwing money away but it's not worth it to return it.
1.0,This is a cheap band- color comes off if you sweat or get band wet.  Totally useless- don’t waste your money!
1.0,"Said ""cute glitter heart"" but NO GLITTER!! Very disappointed."
1.0,I will be returning tank top is very short and  shiny not very impressed
1.0,I ordered an XXL because I have large breasts. The material in front is so small. I had muffin boob. Not enough coverage at all.  Disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered pink looks more peachy, material is thinner than expected and no side slits."
1.0,Should have read the reviews. The large is like a child's large. This should be classified as a girl's skirt.
1.0,"TOO SMALL, THIN, AND BAD QUALITY"
1.0,Nothing like the picture. They’re not even real jeans. Super disappointed
1.0,Been having this set about a month.*TurnGREEN* You get what you pay for. This set looked very simply and great. Give it a month. You'll be telling your self. You pay what you get.
1.0,"It was beautiful on receipt but within a week 1/3rd the bracelet turned a darker color almost a copper color, it is unwearable. I was so pleased on receipt I was going to order a second one as a backup. Maybe it was a bad batch or something but it did not last. Send me another one at no charge and if it lasts as advertised and looks as good as it did when it came I would continue to wear it and will order a second"
1.0,Low quality.  Not flattering. Hem rolls up.
1.0,These are horribly thin and rip no matter how gentle you try and put them on.
1.0,FINALLY! a bone style nose ring with a ball at the end big enough that it doesn't fall out! So worth it I am absolutely going to order more!<br /><br />UPDATE— I orders more and the ball at the end is like half the size :( now they fall out they’re not the same as they were before. You can’t return them. Upset.
1.0,"The color was darker than expected. The seams made the dress feel uncomfortable. I did like the material, but I returned the dress."
1.0,Broke immediately and I lost my key.
1.0,My husband really likes it on me so  that good
1.0,Rubbish - the bag arrived with a broken zip
1.0,"Product fabric is fine, however I got mine with a burned mark. No need a replacement... Already ordered a different brand."
1.0,The material is very cheap and sizes run small.
1.0,"I loved the watch, but after only 4 months the small hand fell off and it quit working<br />for really no apparent reason.  I cannot find a way to get a warranty replacement.<br />The page to sell it says it has a 1 year warranty, but no way to go about replacing it."
1.0,i bought these pair of socks and i receive color pack different than what i ordered.<br /><br />Photo image and color description doesnt macht.
1.0,Very upset it's an clean & im a medium & its arms are very short. I'm upset because otherwise it's lovely color & style but not wearable
1.0,Ugly.  Gaudy in size.  Look cheap.
1.0,don't buy
1.0,"I was still on time to return them, the quality is very low."
1.0,There were 2 loose screws placed in the inside of one of the shoes that I hit my foot on when trying the shoes on. I don’t understand why 2 random screws  were in the shoe but I could’ve really hurt my foot
1.0,"These are supposed to fit a baby yet are sized for an adult, such a bummer!!"
1.0,"Absolute crap. There is absolutely no way this is pure stainless steel. I looks and feels like plastic. The &#34;diamonds&#34; don't sparkle at all.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a fossil for a nicer watch that is half the price. Holey moley. If you want to know more about this company, visit their website. The only thing it's missing is the flying toaster wallpaper."
1.0,"I got the gold dress and it didn't look like it did in the pictures. I got the XL & it was too short, too tight in the arms, loose in different areas... it looked cheap - mind you it was only $33, the material was really cheap & felt like it... I had to return it."
1.0,Bought for my costume but not as described and looks nothing like the image shown. I used it as a prop and got something else.
1.0,Look cheap!!
1.0,I really wanted this to be great. I am a server and it ripped on my first shift.
1.0,Novelty socks.  Did not hold up more than one wash.  Disappointed as there was a hole in one sock second time on.
1.0,"Cheaply made, and low quality. I have smaller calves, and I was unable to zip these boots up."
1.0,not like the photo at all! the string in the middle was as thin as thread :/
1.0,"Very difficult to close and open, I can't close it by myself."
1.0,"The neck strap was thick and good quality. Even the button latch was solid. BUT the most important part is the thin string that the phone hangs on, it is a thin piece of plastic wrapped in string, not a cord. It didn't last 1 day with my Samsung Galaxy 10, I made it to noon. My phone went flying and crashed onto hard tile floor.<br />The sticky pad that is on your phone is still firmly attached as well, it's just that plastic piece."
1.0,"The neck was too big and kept sliding down in the back which made me pull it forward constantly. The pockets were more toward the center than the sides so were awkward to use. For me, this just wasn't comfortable. Sent it back."
1.0,Sizes are off
1.0,To get this watch
1.0,"The bottom of this dress is unacceptable and doesn't look like the product shown on Amazon.  I'm past my return period so I guess it will be donated , unusable."
1.0,Snapped as soon as I put it on
1.0,Love the look but very poor quality fabric
1.0,Wanted to like it but it just doesn’t lay well on a smaller frame.
1.0,"Broke easy, fits a little tight. It feels like a odd texture. Definitely don't recommend"
1.0,"Nice but not as breathable as cotton. Fabric sucks into nose and mouth, with air. The paper masks are easiest to breathe."
1.0,it fell apart the second day i had it
1.0,"Notice in the picture it comes down around her shins. I'm 5'4"" and it literally drags on the ground. I have to hold it up just to walk and that's very inconvenient."
1.0,The material os this scarf looks like panty hose.  Terrible!
1.0,"I am an American 2xl. Don’t know which country this 2xl comes from, but it’s no where near.<br /><br />Disappointed, will be sending back."
1.0,"Awful. Don't buy it, you won't receive what you believe you are. I returned mine 5 minutes after opening the package."
1.0,"Don’t buy, The eye shields appear ton have been opened, have fingerprints and possibly used.  The strings are various conditions, some knotted on ends, some tied in a loop. I would never consider using this item to protect my eye following cataract surgery, possibly contaminated."
1.0,These run SUPER SMALL I ordered an XL and my mom who is a size 5 in womens fits in them perfectly. Definitely not as described.
1.0,"This was horrible in my opinion , the slit was rounded....really odd fit."
1.0,Broke super fast lost stones ..
1.0,This was a poorly constructed jacket and I returned it immediately.
1.0,"Incredibly oversized -- I bought size S and it goes down to my knees, practically. The material is as thick as a sweatshirt, which means it's very hot to wear, and most people wear tank tops to stay cool. Too big to hug my body. It's like wearing a sweatshirt someone cut the sleeves off of. Won't buy this brand again. They will not fit your body anything like the photos."
1.0,I ordered an xl.  It fit my 11 year old.  The material is itchy feeling as well.  Do not recommend.
1.0,Stone fell out the first day it was worn. Stay away.
1.0,"My son has only used Bobux shoes and they have proven to be sturdy, ergonomic and very durable. Though they are quite expensive, I compensate it by having just a pair of shoes and a pair of sandals for every size my son gets. Thus, each shoe is used by my son from Monday to Friday  for around four to five months. The shoes get battered but they remain nice and comfortable the whole time. This model was the exception. The first week of using them, they were all peeled in the front. After just two months of using them, both shoes had holes on the front! Awful!"
1.0,They fell apart as soon as I took them out of the bag.  Do not buy!!!
1.0,"It was meant to be a fun Christmas present, yet the poor quality of the product and the fact that the company cancelled our return request, made it a bad experience."
1.0,Washed this product inside out before wearing and the image came off completely.
1.0,There too heavy and the hair is off really easy :(
1.0,Does not look like that picture.  It's on a chain that is very flimsy.  Disappointed! !!
1.0,Don't buy this knockoff
1.0,I ordered this for my wife and it broke right away.<br /><br />I hope the replacement last longer.........<br />🤬
1.0,"It was love at first sight and when I saw the price $19.99 I went ahead and ordered. Came back fast but sadly the sizing was way off. Is going back, I just reordered it two sizes larger in the hope that will fit if it fit then I will give it 5 stars for the style, the feel and the price."
1.0,"Leo looked great. Then my daughter wore it. There was a hole in the side seam. She had worn it so I just sewed the hole. The second time she wore it the zipper broke. So disappointed. I tried to ask about an exchange since this one seemed defective, but the seller said I was over the time period. I won’t order from this seller again."
1.0,"The fit was fine and so was the color, however, there was some kind of stand on the right side of the leg.  I was surprised to see that and try to wash it out however it still seems to be there.  I really don’t have time to return orders so I will just have to except what I got."
1.0,"it was not the color posted, it is more wine color than purple"
1.0,"Tiny, cheaply made dress. I ordered an xl expecting it would run a bit small. My friend who actually is an xs fit in this perfectly."
1.0,"It was too tight to use. Could not get it to stay over my head, and the hair cap that comes with it would make it slide too easily."
1.0,This is a cute novelty hat but don't expect to actually wear it. It was too small for my husband even on the last notch. It also came in an envelope instead of a box which means it was completely smashed.
1.0,Didn’t fit right; I returned it!
1.0,"I buy plus size leggings all the time! Currently I'm 5'8 250lbs. I never have trouble with them fitting, but these leggings run VERY small...wouldn't even fit past my thighs! I probably could have got them on eventually with a lot of work and feeling like a stuffed sausage! I guess plus size means your a size 2 with this company, because my 9 year old daughter fits in these!! Don't buy!!"
1.0,Refunded! The necklace did not need a warranty it wasent that nice!
1.0,These bags are very small!
1.0,Looked like a maternity dress.
1.0,This does not work if you are 43 and nursed 7 children.  I won’t even post a photo to spare your eyes from melting 🤦🏻‍♀️
1.0,It's beautuful but the gem fell out before I even got to wear it.
1.0,"Ordered XXL got a small, don't buy"
1.0,"The boots are cute. However, they arrived in two slightly different sizes. Ordered a woman’s size 9 which is what I typically wear in any type of shoe or boot. The left boot was slightly small, but might have considered making it work if the right boot had not been about 1/2” shorter than the left. Another disappointing factor is that the faux fur inside the boot sheds horribly! Needless to say, these have been returned."
1.0,"I ordered the 3 large tumble smoky Quartz that were suppose to be between 1 and 1 1/2 inches.  I only received two.  One was less than 1 inch and the other was barely 1 inch.  There was a third rock in the envelope was  tiny and black (not a smokey quartz) and it was just over 1 CENTIMETER big! I complained, they sent me a reimbursement stone along with a Kleenex as if to say &#34;Cry about it some more.&#34;  Very rude and disrespectful considering they were the ones that messed up the order to begin with.  I will not be ordering from them again due to the small size and poor customer service."
1.0,Completely disappointed and mislead.  2 pieces of metal and a rubber band.  Worst purchase I've made on Amazon
1.0,did  not like fabric or fit
1.0,"Poorly made, too long, to large"
1.0,Pants are really small for the size that you picked.  Also the fabric is too thin very light . and the pants is not adjustable for the inside.  Totally disappointed .  I have to return it back. '
1.0,"well made frames, durable. it is like looking through a fish bowl though"
1.0,Seams came undone on my very first ski trip with these. Not well made
1.0,"Band was comfortable and i liked it, but just a couple weeks in, it ripped at the clasp, and it's not worth shipping back."
1.0,I was going to give it to my daughter but I didn’t like it.
1.0,"I feel mixed about this post because I love this dress and how it looks on me. A lot. But after wearing it 3 times, the back portion of the dress split between the white and blue bands, so it is not on a seam and it is not repairable. Maybe I just got a poorly manufactured one and I love it so much I am considering buying it again, but I hesitate in case the quality is the same."
1.0,"I purchased two masks.  The first one was fine, if a bit over-sized, but the second was a joke.  The metal that goes around your nose was in the bottom of the mask, not the top.  The pocket for the filter was too small for the filters that WERE SHIPPED WITH THE MASK.  Completely unusable.<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,At least say it's the queensryche logo come on.
1.0,Not the same tear drop shape pictured in photo or that I purchased before.  And this cut isn’t symmetrical at all.
1.0,"These were a huge let down. In the package and off they are SUPER cute, but they are so dense in fabric that there is almost ZERO stretch which makes them incredibly hard to put on, and they don’t even pull up all the way so it’s like the crotch gusset doesn’t even sit where it is supposed to. And, the fabric is SUPER see through. I didn’t even need to squat to check to see if they were see through, it was that bad."
1.0,"The only reason I gave it one star is only because of how nice the colors are and the fabric. Other than that it's way too small, the customer service was awful and they did not solve my return problem due to some 2 week long Chinese holiday."
1.0,BIG FAT LIE!!!!!! This is not leather!!! It’s PU leather.....plastic!!! How do these companies get away with this? Just flat lying???????
1.0,Medium and small were. It’s too big
1.0,"I read the reviews beforehand, maybe I received a bad pair. I have other brands of long  compression socks and these are the only ones that don't come to my knees which I found annoying and painful. There's something about the compression not making it to the knee and everything pooling there that hurts.  Also, the toe area was disproportionately loose/large and caused uncomfortable bunching in my shoes. I won't wear them again."
1.0,This was poor quality and looked nothing like photos. It was too expensive to return. It would have been more expensive to return than the purchase price!
1.0,"Way too big.  Because sides flare out, purse is much larger than dimensions.  It's on the pile to Good Will. My last time buying a purse online."
1.0,"Both gloves tore and ripped from next to nothing use, put them in a drawer for 2 months and got them out and put them on and the seems started to rip apart faat. Absolute traah"
1.0,This bra was ridiculous!! Had no support and was nothing like it says as far as comfort and support.
1.0,The size was xxxl but fir like small.
1.0,Way too small. Cute little shoes though..
1.0,I cancelled order less than 24 hours after placing order- they would not cancel - it HAD NOT SHIPPED but they still would not cancel - not happy -size NOT accurate
1.0,My earrings were broke when I received them. Will you replace them?
1.0,Too small.. I was expecting large oversized earrings but they were small
1.0,"I've been a bit skeptical about these for years but I've always wanted one. I finally ordered and I've been let down, it might just be this specific one, but definitely looking to return."
1.0,Very very small. Like a thong
1.0,"Don't waste your money, this stuff garbage!!! Only 10 of them worked.."
1.0,I followed the reviews and got the size everyone stated.  WOW was that wrong wayyyyy too big  sending back
1.0,Size smaller than expected.  Can't really wear them as they are too tight.
1.0,"I ordered a large for the shirts, and ended up with the label that says large, but the shirt is small. I'm really not that fat."
1.0,They were way small my 11 year old couldn’t even get them on
1.0,"This black and white shirt is very thin and see through. The shirt is thin and that would be okay, but the way it is sewn there is a large piece of fabric that is hanging down underneath around the collar and even with a camisole underneath it, it is very obvious. When this shirt arrived there was a spot on the seam where it was not sewn properly and there was a hole in the seam. The hole was right in the front and even after repairing it, it looked obvious that it had been fixed. The shirt is overall poor quality and cheaply made.<br />I ordered this shirt in a US 4-6 (M). I am about 5’6.5” tall and 135 pounds. This shirt was really flowy and not at all fitted looking like the picture. The sleeves also just hang sadly and do not look pretty like the picture. This shirt was a disappoint me.<br /><br />I bought this product full price for my own use…. And got a refund for the issues with the hole in it."
1.0,"Wouldn't recommend it ,the material is not good for this style it look like cotton on the site which i think it would be a better material for this style,when it arrive i was disappointed"
1.0,Very disappointed! Was valentine present to myself! Size was all wrong! Color was disgustingly dirty. Wanted this ring for a long time. Wont recommend!
1.0,"I thought this had drawstrings to adjust length on the sides but it’s literally just ties on the sides for decoration. It just looks weird having ties for no reason. Not even worth the cheap price, I bought a similar dress on here that actually lets you adjust length for only $5 more. I bought a large and I’m 5’7” and 165 lbs, I thought it was a little small but I could wear it."
1.0,Not happy!  It’s way to short
1.0,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this,  as I wore it the first time, the clasp broke off and when I tried returning it, they claimed I broke it!"
1.0,The inside was broken and tilted and so was the glass I sent it back very disappointed.
1.0,Not what it looks like material different
1.0,Thin material and sized at least 2 sizes to small. If you wear a larger then order a 2xl
1.0,Bought this watch for my Mom and it quit working within 3 months.
1.0,"I rarely write reviews but I must for this watch. It is the most complicated digital watch that I have ever used. Touch screen aside, (which is new for me) I found it to be really difficult to use and I think that it is pretty touch sensitive because it could never keep the time/date that I set it to."
1.0,"If you are looking for a COMPRESSION tank, DO NOT BUY THIS.  I purchased it and it fits like a normal tank top, no compression at all.<br /><br />I'm a medium size and I purchased a small, fits somewhat loose.  Again, this DOES NOT COMPRESS."
1.0,You get what you pay for... Cheaply made amd smell awful.
1.0,"I bought this for a Harry Potter party I was going to because this link popped up when I put in Hermione Granger costume. DO NOT BUY IT. From the picture, it looks black on the outside and purple on the inside, which is as close as you can come without spending an arm and a leg on a cape for a costume. This is all purple and it's scratchy. I was so disappointed. I had to hurry and change my costume, last minute,  because I didn't have time to order another one."
1.0,"I'm returning it,  not what I expected."
1.0,Calves too large
1.0,"Wouldn't fit on my watch after trying for an hour. After reading some of the other reviews, it looks like I may have been able to get it on by bending the bars, but there's no reason I should need to do that. I'll just get a watch band that is made correctly."
1.0,Would not recommend at all! This was nothing like what the description was for this shirt. Terrible quality and fit.
1.0,Is this actually Childrens or Womens? Because I normally wear a size medium but I read in the reviews that the sizes are inaccurate (run small) so i got an XL to be safe.. NOPE. It literally looks like I ordered an XS but when i looked at the tag and it read XL.<br /><br />Literally huge waste of time wow.<br /><br />I thought I was going crazy so I tried them on and the shorts would not fit past my knees. I am returning it and never buying from this seller again. I would recommend no one buys these either.
1.0,Broke just 2 days after getting it. Poorly made.
1.0,"It would randomly stop working and holding time. I used it maybe 1 week before I noticed this defect or faulty battery. However, another morning I woke up and it was fast by 30 minutes. So it’s hard to blame it solely on the battery."
1.0,"Low quality. When these arrived, they had been sent ain pouch and one of the posts was bent to an extreme angle. Post metal was too soft. Did not look durable at all. Arrived with scratch on earring surface. Returned product."
1.0,The 3xl wouldn't even fit my size xs step daughter.
1.0,This coat is very thin.  The “fur” trimming is held on by buttons placed at odd intervals along the edge. I am not pleased at all with this item.
1.0,Very small and there is a dragon eye in the middle and they do not know where the product is at I got the product in a total different day then when they said I will get it.
1.0,Didnt like these. Way heavy and they dont look like the photo at all defently wasnt worth the 4 week wait to be delivered
1.0,"We bought the mask for my daughter, she wore it one time for a few hours and the lights wouldn't come back on. It was not the batteries.  Thankfully another place was open to buy another for the whole purpose it was bought for."
1.0,"Thin fabric, looks cheep."
1.0,"Even if the mirror finish wasn't scratched off on the pair I received, it still wouldn't be worth this price. Spots of clear coat cracked along the bottom. The bag it comes in for storage is better quality. I'd expect to see these glasses at a dollar store."
1.0,Paper thin awful quality. Gave it to Good Will
1.0,The dress was way too big on me! It looked like pajamas for sure. Had to return it! Think I bought a xl and that’s my normal size!
1.0,Super cheap. Broke in 3 days.
1.0,They sent me the wrong size. I love the looked of the dress but never got to put it on so never got to see how it really look
1.0,"I never would have bought if I was informed that these men's pajama have NO FLY. I would have returned, but they were washed before I tried them on."
1.0,Don't order the wine red.  It's a ketchup red.  And the size runs large.  The picture is not the correct color.  Totally disappointed
1.0,I don't write reviews I order from Amazon every week and when I research a product I'm usually good to go.THIS CHAIN LOOKS VERY WELL MADE BROKE IN LESS THAN A WEEK NOT HAPPY AT ALL SPENT TOP DOLLAR Disappointed.
1.0,The cut for this is way too small. Also has no give to it.
1.0,"The picture of the shark on the back shows it going down approx. 1/2 way down the back, which is what I wanted. What I received was a pic of a shark that covered almost the whole back that went almost to the ass end of the shirt and looks gross."
1.0,I ordered size medium but received size small...had to return it.
1.0,"This is a horrible product. It looks terrible in anyone who’s tried it on. The top doesn’t fit well, the bottoms are either too small or too large (is purchased both a small and medium). They’re cheap looking and badly sewn. I can’t recommend them at all."
1.0,"I thought this was going to be a thumb stone, small like the picture… but it isn’t.<br />It is pretty and shiny and all the things, but just not what I wanted or the size that’s pictured.<br />And there’s a chip on the smooth part!"
1.0,I had them for 4 days and they broke right at the nose piece. They were super cute just poorly made.
1.0,"Not pearls but little micro mini white plastic dots.  Arrived missing ""pearls"" on the mask and broken inside package."
1.0,"Horrible quality! I ordered size 10/11 and they came in a size 6, the boots are deformed and very thin material with creases and indents all over the top and sides. The decorative straps around the ankle are not attached to the boot at all, I attempted to return the boots and the seller was only willing to refund me $13 ! I paid $32.99 plus $13 shipping! This has to be a scam. Do NOT buy from this seller."
1.0,They are too large and spin around the watch face.
1.0,I love the quality. Very pretty. But didn't fit. I always buy a 2x and this shirt was way too small. 😒
1.0,Purchased 2 of the same pair a couple weeks ago. Wore them 3 times on one pair and 5 with the other. Both lasted roughly a week.<br />I had a similar pair that I purchased from Pro Acme in 2017 that I still wear. They changed the plastics up which was detrimental to their quality.
1.0,Tiny chintzy piece of crap! Not accurately depicted online. I was completely disappointed. I felt like this was a misleading sale.
1.0,"I’m just as bummed as everyone else leaving bad reviews for a dress that had the potential to be so lovely. I’m 5’8”, 135 lbs, 34dd and ordered an XL based on the reviews to size up. I’ve been so excited to get this dress for a wedding in France, but was disappointed as soon as I opened the bag. The material is not soft as many claimed but extremely scratchy. The bodice comes just below my breasts (empire waist)and is sewn incorrectly so the neckline and waist sticks out in places. It make me look like I’m pregnant and it’s frumpy frumpy frumpy. Mine came with a nude liner, which is also poorly sewn and frumpy. I tried to wear a black one piece bodice underneath it and even my seven year old said “that’s ugly, mommy.”  Hope I can send it back."
1.0,Unsewn already after an hour wear
1.0,"I have been wearing compression hose for years. These are among the very hardest to get on and off I've ever had. And I bought them because the selling point is that they are easy on and off. Misleading advertising! The person in the TV commercial who slips these socks on effortlessly is surely putting on a pair of socks other than these. If those are available, let me know. In the meanwhile, these go back where they came from."
1.0,Shows as a set but only received the top!!
1.0,Crap material
1.0,Should have read the reviews.  Ordered a large and got a size 6. Size chart says large 10.
1.0,"I love the “glow in the dark feature.  That being said, I have ordered 3 of this item. Not 1 stayed in tact after less than a week!  The glow in the dark feature falls off within days. I am left with what looks like a common house fly!!  I have thrown away the package and have no way of rety. 🤬"
1.0,Literally have washed the sweatshirt two or three times and there’s spots on it. They have faded like bleach spots but it definitely hasn’t been bleached and the fabric pills up very fast so it’s not a good quality sweatshirt..
1.0,"Came in folded, thought that after I took it out of the box it would pop up and take its shape but it didn’t, I returned it, I was very disappointed"
1.0,"Picture is misleading. They do not look like picture. Also, they got the button part right....but there is no hole to button them. 🤔"
1.0,"I wanted to be excited about these earrings, but both pairs the earrings broke. The rose gold pair I didn’t even get to wear once, as the back clasp fell right off, and the silver pair I lost one as it fell out and I didn’t feel it. Pretty earrings but too flimsy"
1.0,my falt
1.0,Didn't work that great and ran small in size
1.0,Not actually surgical steel
1.0,This says it's a 2 pack.  It's not.  Only one mask came.
1.0,Not flattering. Too big. Not what the picture shows at all.
1.0,This shirt hugs everything! Only buy if you are a medium or smaller and order up!
1.0,Lasted for a couple weeks
1.0,I didn’t care for these tops because they were hot!  The outside is soft but the inside was too scratchy
1.0,I received this dress to go to a wedding..let's just say i had to buy another dress. The dress is not what rhe picture showed. It was not a shiny looking fabric shown in the picture. The dress was ugly!
1.0,This shirt is garbage. It's cut is very weird. I can see the neck hole is a larger on but it was practically an off the shoulder shirt. The sides went up so high it went past the top of my jeans and I threw it away when I saw the bat wing arm pit. The sleeves fit but the shirt was so wide it made a bat wing. Don't buy!
1.0,I didn't receive my earrings instead I got a cosmetic brush very disappointed
1.0,This product doesn’t work. It’s comfortable and nice sized but the piece that holds it in place constantly falls off. I wore mine for about 2 days and lost the bottom piece several times. I don’t recommend this product at all!
1.0,Quality just isn’t there. I ordered 4 bags until I finally found the perfect sling bag. This one was the worst out of the 4.
1.0,Flipped position is right smack inmiddle of field of vision for distance viewing. Doh!
1.0,These earrings look NOTHING like the pictures on Amazon!  They look extremely cheep.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Sole is coming off after just one wear. Very disappointed.
1.0,Too short and it feels like fake top as the fabric is too rough.
1.0,It's pretty to look at but the dragonfly is suitable more for a necklace.  The dragonfly is too big for an ankle bracelet & it would be uncomfortable on the ankle bone
1.0,"Doesn’t even look like same product. Bought a large and it was tiny like an xtra small. Probably will never buy lingerie online ever again, less stress just going to the store."
1.0,"Meh, had to return due to one clasp breaking immediately after opening.  Didn't even attach to any piece of clothing, just opened and it sprang off.  Attempted to put back together, but kept breaking.  Will keep looking, worth it to pay more for a better quality product."
1.0,I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  This dress does not fit with a overhang of the top; rather it is taught to the waist.  I even had my six 6 daughter try it on with the same results.
1.0,This was a 3x. Fit my sz 12 daughter. I wear a sz 16. Dissapointed!
1.0,It is junk.  Mine fell apart the first day.
1.0,It ripped as soon as my husband put it on his arm.  Horrible quality!
1.0,CHeap quality...ripped at the finger tips first time I wore them!
1.0,they broke the first day i used them
1.0,The quality of the product was different from what I received. I requested a refund and sent it back.
1.0,Not a plus size!
1.0,Ugly... not flattering at all! It fits like a garbage bag. I am a size 2 and it made me look like a size 8. I am 5’5 and the flair at the bottom was at a very awkward spot and looked frumpy.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
1.0,Why would anyone buy SC stuff until SC gets rid of the FB head coach!
1.0,Beautiful design but the chain is round and catches the hair. Very uncomfortable
1.0,"The pockets in this dress are thick and weird. It make your hips look HUGE! DON'T buy, it will only disappoint - Not sleek like the pics."
1.0,The stone looks very cheap and not flattering.
1.0,"I'm 6&#34;2'....235 lbs. Using the fit guide, I ordered the Large 34-36 waist. Also, while you may think it's &#34;too much information&#34;, I really have &#34;no junk in my trunk&#34;. Have little to no butt.<br />Even at that, I had a &#34;plumbers crack&#34; while standing! Can't tell you if the waist size is accurate (though I believe so) because I couldn't get them pulled up anywhere near my waist.<br />Very disappointed. Returned product."
1.0,Child wore for about a week and pin broke out of strap.  2nd watch bought. Child lost 1st one because of this issue the 1st time. Child is 12.
1.0,Terrible fit and cheap fabric. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Improper fit
1.0,This is not your ordinary romper.  The diaper area does not snap. What a waste of $!
1.0,"I ordered this item to match the earrings also offerred. Again, this product was such a disappointment! I love Swarovski crystal, so I expected the same quality one would expect, given the reputation. However, it looks like a very poor imitation. It is so ugly that I could not even give it away without embarassment!!"
1.0,If you are a plus size then order the dress 2 sizes up...was very disappointed bought to wear at my sisters funeral had go out last minute and find something else. Does not stretch or fit close to your size
1.0,This item fits very small to size. I even went a size up and it was still too small.
1.0,Too jeans inseam too short for the style.
1.0,post are super long.. not for everyday wear
1.0,Fell apart right away
1.0,"Socks fit very snug, uncomfortable."
1.0,I’ve been seeing people get this on TikTok and decided to buy the pj’s idk if this is supposed to fit a child but for this being an XL this is small and I’ve order Asian size XL before also the bottoms look nothing like the picture just some booty shorts basically. If there’s the legit version of this you might as well spend the money and buy that one.
1.0,It was a little too large and the pant legs weren’t tapered even a little so it needs to be tailored. I’m 5”6 and it was too long to wear with flats. It also was folded she it was delivered and gets majorly creased
1.0,ABOVE.
1.0,I hate to leave poor reviews. These unzip with body movement which to embarrassing and unhandy! I fixed the problem by putting a safety pin in after the bra was on. But...
1.0,"Advertised as having crystal and zirconia- neither of which are in the ring.  It is blue enamel with crushed shell pieces.  I get it’s an inexpensive piece, but false advertising is false advertising."
1.0,Nothing like it looks. Very cheap looking purple back ground .Just not flattering at all
1.0,Item when received did not look the same.  Material is really thin.  Shirt looks as if it has a trim on model but it does not.  Edges are unfinished.
1.0,"I love the bag. But unfortunately the closure on the outside was broken. Returned it today. However, I have another one arriving soon.,"
1.0,At 1st I was in love with this belt. I am kinda picky and wanted a certain thickness plus I wanted a soft leather not a real stiff leather feel and this belt is those things. But after about a month of having this belt it is about to split in half. I actually bought 2 of these belts and the 1st one was a size to big so I haven't worn it but it seems to be the same quality. I don't expect a belt to last 10 years but 1 year would be reasonable I think.
1.0,Look very cheap.  A gift I never gave.
1.0,The lights didn’t work.
1.0,"The chain looks nice and appeared to be durable.  However, the first time my daughter wore it, it broke in half."
1.0,"Honestly for this price point it’s not worth it at all. My child who just turned 6 thinks it’s boring and could care less about it after about 5 mins of excitement (simply because it was an LOL smart watch like moms) The games are super cheesy and not fun. I think they just threw together something LOL related to make $. I’d try your luck with another. These should sell for like $15 maybe, as far as worth."
1.0,It broke without me even needing to use much force. Would not recommend
1.0,"Still waiting on communication about returning the item. First, the printing on the ""sweatshirt"" is awful. Every single white panel has red bleeding onto it, enough to make it look pink. Second, I'm pretty sure it was meant to be worn by a child because at a minimum it's 3-4 sizes too small, and that's not an exaggeration. My wife was home when it was delivered and she decided to try it on because I wasn't home and she thought it looked awful small (I ordered the 3x just to be on the safe side because I know orders shipping from China are typically smaller and though the tag says 3x it fits at best like a Large) and it wouldn't fit her. When I finally saw it in person I couldn't even get my arm completely down the sleeve, much less even attempt to try this thing on. Last is the actual material the sweatshirt is made from...I'm not even sure what it is, but I've never had anything made out of whatever it is. The material is very slick and shiny, not anything that you would expect a sweatshirt to be made from. Not appealing at all. Thanks to all of this I'm now waiting for communication back from the seller and hoping I'm able to recoup my money. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,I would not order again
1.0,"The boot openings are way too small for average sized calves. I couldn't even get my feet down into the boots. I tried to pull them all the way up anyway, and the thighs are also too small, the torso is too short- with the top barely coming over my belly button. Also, the straps barely hook. I'm a 5'3 female, weigh 195, and wear a size 18 Jean and Xl shirt. Hope that helps!"
1.0,These are not Tiffany blue color and the description is misleading.  The glasses are actually green.
1.0,the snowman bag is not what is shown or described. It's a  cream color bag with a tan handle
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these masks. One was too large, one was extra small. Poor quality, seams pulled apart, NO nose holder. They were cute, just just not wearable."
1.0,"What the heck,  I have size 11 1/2 feet. These are suppose to fit 10-13, I can't even get these on. What kind of foot did they use.<br /> Don't buy these. If you wear a size 10 they may fit you."
1.0,"Did not fit watch as described, will be returning."
1.0,The pearl fell off after 2 hours of normal wear.
1.0,This 1X tee fits like a large...
1.0,Least durable belt I have ever owned.  Wore it four times and it cracked and is not longer usable.
1.0,Even on low heat they shrink.  Suggest not purchasing.
1.0,Its cheaply made it looks cheap
1.0,Does not look like pictures online. Poor quality
1.0,Haven't had them 24 hours. Wasn't even able to put them in yet & they are broke.
1.0,"Box label is correct, however once I opened the box, well bad news..wrong item..<br />Really needed today...plus ensure merchandise is actually viewed & correct before attempting to send me the correct one please.<br />Truly disappointing!<br />Andrea Bow<br />111 Bramwell Drive<br />Summerville,  SC 29485"
1.0,"I ordered a size 4t, but received a size 3/4, in my opinion it would fit a small size 3, maybe a size 2"
1.0,"Bad fit, especially the bust area. Material is stiff and not flowy which does not give it a good shape near the sleeves. Returning it."
1.0,It consistently looses time over the day.  Not a good watch.
1.0,"I was amazed by the pictures and ordered this blouse. just a letter ""L"" sticker on the plastic bag! I opened it and it had a spot on it! guess it was a return item and may be in size XS! cause it was too small to even try it on."
1.0,"Cheaply made. When it arrived, two of the clips were already broken and another broke as soon as I put a purse on it. Also the two straps are different sizes. One fit over my door perfectly and the other one was such a stretch."
1.0,"Fabric is stretchy t-shirt type of fabric, no shaping or support whatsoever.  Piecework makes no sense and produces weird bulges at knees and inner hips.  Shorter inseam than stated."
1.0,Runs much larger than anticipated
1.0,Not made for work purposes. Very flimsy
1.0,"Ordered in black. Shirt arrived with deodorant stains on them. It made me want to gag when I saw this right out of the plastic ziplocked package. Also the material is very stiff, compared to the same exact shirt in pink I’ve bought before. Will be returning."
1.0,"The shoes are very nice.  They become extremely slippery in the shower, you can actually slip out of the shoes because there is no grip once wet..  They are fine to wear around the house.  Please don't use in shower...."
1.0,"Came with slits cut out of the flares. Didn't hold shape, and weren't true size. Go with a different brand, I did and the others are great."
1.0,"I bought 3 of these, all Nike Dryfit, the only difference, the color.  They look like they came from different manufacturers.  Two of them shrank so much they are unwearable, the 3rd one fits perfectly.  I would not buy this product again.  I suspect counterfeit branding."
1.0,This dress is pretty but came with a hole right by the zipper.
1.0,"I bought 2 coat. One S and it’s was to big. Ordered another XS - too small. Returned first np but meet that I have to pay for return with second coat, what ? Why ? Horrible! Is that what I paying for  prime ?<br />Ps. Btw Quality is good. But size are strange."
1.0,This product's sizing is wrong. It is too tight. XXL size should actually be a Small. I usually wear XXL and I could not fit into this. It is actually should be made for kids not men
1.0,"Honestly if I could give this a negative I would. Poor quality, warped metal frame the material is wrapped around and the red ribbon is right where your face is suppose to be. Can't even use this. DO NOT get this junk."
1.0,I was very disappointed in the sweater. It fit snug even though I ordered a 2X. I thought the material of the sweater would be different. I just wasn't pleased.
1.0,"I love the style of these glasses, but the quality lack.  The screw attaching the right came out within just a few hours of normal use.  I did my best to screw it back in.  Then then the other side came out too.  Not good.<br />I contacted the seller (past the refund date) to see if they would replace them.  I got no answer.<br />Overall, not worth the price due to quality control and questionable customer service."
1.0,"La malla en la primera lavada se descosió totalmente. La calidad de las costuras es deficiente, La Lycra  es de buena calidad y queda a la medida. Lamentablemente perdimos la ventana de devoluciones y nos hemos quedado con el producto defectuoso después de dos usos."
1.0,Not for use on small dainty necklaces. The holes are to thick for anything to fit.
1.0,Does not fit they are not true to size
1.0,not correct sizing or fit
1.0,"Arm hinges barely move, lenses are loose, glasses are heavy and poorly constructed, uncomfortable and did zero to help prevent eyestrain and migraines. Returning product."
1.0,The product was not strong. not a sport watch band delicate for sure!
1.0,"I loved these glasses but they are very cheaply made, they broke in a week<br />Of use."
1.0,"Read the whole description, kept saying Czech meteorite. But go to materials is says replicated Czech meteorite. I bought for the spiritual reasons . Makes me sad."
1.0,Don't even accept it as a free present
1.0,The umbrella arrived broken and it would not stay open.
1.0,"I am disappointed in this purchase though the material feels good. The Neck is too wide, slipping all the way from shoulder to my arm and It is way toooo short I am just 5.6ft, instead of the excess to the arms why not add some lenght?<br />In conclusion, I think you should have this in various sizes"
1.0,The shirt is made of cheap material.  The shirt is longer than expected!!
1.0,Never got it. Ordered it last year on Thanksgiving and now it’s Back to School time and I still haven’t got it. Was gonna give it to my granddaughter after getting out of her heart surgery but now what can I do?
1.0,"I can't leave less than one star. I'm a size 10-12 so I ordered the regular and the plus size/<br /><br />Regular size great! Plus sized literally ripped open on the ass part within twenty minutes. Good thing I was on a cross country flight? No, it wasn't. By the time I landed on the west coast the hole was Huuuge. V poor quality/ feel like I'm buying from LLR. Oh well, get what you pay for with these :("
1.0,Recieved this as a gift. Immediately when I tried it on the back of the watch fell off. I was not able to get it to stay on so I returned it. Watch looked very cheap.
1.0,"So I ordered this in a 3xl... When I attempted to try it on, it would barely come up over my knee. I was expecting it to be a little tight in the thigh area but for it not to come up at all is disappointing for me. The bra area of the shaper fits very well no issues or complaints there. The waist measurements are pretty accurate maybe off an inch but not too bad. I feel the leg opening measurements need to be added. Had I known that the leg area was this small I would have known not to order. It is well made over all."
1.0,Poorly made & too small
1.0,First pair were great. Ordered a second and it came moldy. Seller will not refund or replace.
1.0,The quality was not as expected. The letters were not white at all! more like a odd pink.
1.0,"Large does not fit a 28” hard cover piece of luggage. Very difficult to get it to fit over luggage and zipper. In fact on its third time of being checked in at the airport, when at baggage claim it  appeared to have come  off and has not been found. I recommend getting one that also has a strap to connect prior to zippering."
1.0,Way too big! My watch won’t even stay unlocked because the band is so loose.
1.0,Cute at first but Shrunk 3 sizes on first wash. My son couldn’t wear for Xmas morning. 👎🏻
1.0,Broken with first wear.
1.0,"this dress comes extremely longer than pictured, comes down to my shins"
1.0,"Horrible socks! They do not stretch at all to pull comfortably on baby’s legs!<br />Also if you somehow manage to put these on, they will skid out when the baby crawls"
1.0,"Los 5 pares de mangas camufladas se ajustan al anuncio, los 5 pares negras no sirven porque son muy pequeñas y prácticamente uno es estafado con este producto."
1.0,"did not fit like others, I guess run small. sitting in my drawer"
1.0,"I wanted to return the dress i got, as it was just not flattering AT ALL , the top way to big and stiff, the shoulders didnt fall as i anticipated. etc. I went to return the package, the seller never sent me a return label. Just the bar code to add inside my returned box, I went to USPS with there free box, they offer, it was going to cost close $40 but with the address they provided , there was no country listed. They said if i purchase the bag it may cost more. I just decided to say forget it. Too much of a hassle. However, i know now not to purchase from this seller again."
1.0,Way to small for the size i chose
1.0,Broke pretty much as soon as I opened the package
1.0,T shirt material soft.  Poor shapeless fit.  Top is long and I have a fairly long torso.
1.0,Bought three times. Each time i would go up a size but it remained too tiny and I gave up. Don’t buy!
1.0,Fake. Not sterling. Mildly magnetic. Very disappointed as I'm highly allergic to anything not silver or gold.
1.0,Hate this product horrible quality fauna big. Cheap!!!! Nothing like the photo online..
1.0,Bought these for me and my bestfriend. My charm broke the same day
1.0,way to small for my wife
1.0,Ordered a Xtra large and its something a small child could fit
1.0,This is more like a solid color flannel. Not a warm flannel either. It’s too short for my 5’2 son..
1.0,I bought an XXL and it more like a Medium.<br />It has a slip under it but still very thin material and see through.  Not happy at all.
1.0,"Fits fine, but the link that holds the strap is cheap and bent within 5 minutes. Don't buy this shoe"
1.0,"I returned this without even taking it out of the package. Very poor quality and not at all as expected:<br /><br />1. fabric is a cheaply shiny fabric, not cotton, that looks like it will fall apart on first wash<br /><br />2. Pattern is not as cute as shown. It’s fuzzy and much darker in color.<br /><br />3. Style and size is not as expected - it’s a surgical style pleated mask with flimsy strings and it’s huge and baggy looking. Not fitted at all.<br /><br />4. Nose plate is so flimsy it could be made from folded aluminum foil.<br /><br />Not at all recommended…"
1.0,Not an xl size by American standards
1.0,This dress is NOT pase the knee and it's very tight. I'm very curve but very small waist and flat stomach and this dress was horrible. Any other dress I'd wear a large or med. This one will never order again .
1.0,One of the worst things I’ve ever purchased on Amazon. It looks like a worn out hand-me-down nightgown. It has no shape to it and exposes the entire outline of your bra
1.0,Slow shipping and I have to reset it everyday because it does not keep up with the correct time. Just going throw it in the trash. Wasted $25.
1.0,"I ordered both this brand and the Mumetaz brand and the quality, material, and color of the Mumetaz brand is much better."
1.0,"La caja vino en malas condiciones. No se si el artículo esta usado, ppr eso lo estoy regresando."
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THESE! I ordered an XXL and they won't even fit my daughter that is 10 years old and wears kid sizes!
1.0,Should have returned them and didn’t<br />They are undersized and if you at over 6’ they seem<br />Pretty short in the inseam
1.0,"I'm going to assume it was too small. I didn't bother trying it on. The description is not what arrived. The material of what arrived is a super cheap, sheer, polyester."
1.0,"Nunca me llegó, se perdió y nunca Me lo repusieron."
1.0,Does not stay clipped to the watch. Comes apart putting the watch on and from doing daily activities.
1.0,I bought two of these and They fit my kids great but both stopped charging within the first two uses. Loved the idea but doesn’t last 😕
1.0,"Decent quality cycling knickers in terms of flat seams, fabric density, etc. but I'm absolutely BAFFLED by the chamois placement. It appears to be sewn in about 3 or 4 inches too far back/toward my booty. So the front part of the chamois, which should be seated under and slightly in front of my lady bits, ends right in the middle of everything. The tip of the chamois ends, umm...kind of right behind the babymaker part, not the pee making part. The front half of my bits & bobs isn't on the chamois at all. The stitching on the shorts looks right from the outside, you can see where the chamois is supposed to be seated within the knickers, but the actual chamois isn't seated in that area. Really irritating purchase."
1.0,ITS NOT WORTH THE STRUGGLE . You spend way too much time trying to attach the band. I never even got mines to connect . It's the worst .
1.0,My son wore this for like 3 days and the material near the toes wore out. These were nice to look at until they got used. Disappointed at wasting my money
1.0,I bought these for my daughter.  They didn't make it through one day and the heal broke.
1.0,"I'm glad I noticed the misspelling of ""Italian"" on the shirt before I bought it for my son."
1.0,My girl isn't happy because the shirt isnt the same color as the shorts which is shown the same in the picture but it's not
1.0,"I wish I had retuned this when I received it. The material is awful. The fit was huge, and I have a large chest, the length was way too long for me (5'2&#34;). If I weren't in the middle of moving when I received it I would have sent it back. Have never gotten a chance to wear it."
1.0,Was very small did not go ar all plus came all squished in like a 4x4 bag
1.0,Today is June 11th. I got these May 9th. After just a few days I felt irritation but i continues to wear because they’re supposed to be 925. I couldn’t take it anymore. I got blisters between my toes. I’m very allergic to nickel. These are clearly just plated over SUPER cheap metal.
1.0,"I ordered this exact dress previously, it's comfortable in warm weather, so wanted another. As you can see, the new dress is way shorter, and the fabric is not as nice. Especially if you are tall, this dress is not for you. They are clearly cutting costs!"
1.0,i am not satisfied at all
1.0,Heavy material. More like a cheap men’s basketball short. I am returning.
1.0,"Is not the correct size, the image shows a little girl using it and the size is for adults"
1.0,item turned colors after on wear.
1.0,"If you try to put anything in the back pocket, it makes it difficult to get credit cards out of the slots.  I tore my fingers up.  Returned."
1.0,This is a terrible product . Within a month the soles fell off completely.. waste of money!
1.0,Not what I expected !
1.0,The quality of this is so poor looks cheap and runs small very disappointed!
1.0,Misleading product said it was faux leather turned out to be real leather. Very disappointed..
1.0,"This skirt is way to small and poorly made. I wear a size small in skirts and tops. When I initially ordered it I thought it might be a bit too big from previous experiences with one size fits. This seems like an xxsmall. This stitching near the zipper was sewn incorrectly, you can barely open and close the zipper. There is leftover thread hanging all over the skirt where it was sewn. The colors are beautiful but unfortunately the product is severely flawed!"
1.0,They don't work very well and feel cheap.
1.0,"I would give it lower rating if I could.  The problem  is the the button hole was incorrectly sized.  The top button was approx 1/2 inch (12mm) and the button hole was 1/4 inch (6mm).  I lost any and all respect for this.  Adding insult to frustration, the cloth used for these shorts was poplin, 65% cotton and 45% poly.  I have the unpleasant experience of my old USMC cammies falling apart quickly from that useless poplin material.  Poplin is garbage, avoid it."
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt. It's see through and has bad stitching.
1.0,Beautiful earrings too heavy and not stable.
1.0,"There's always words written behind some people's words. Make<br /> sure you read between LINES!!!  Also Mother told me ""BUY CHEAP GET CHEAP"""
1.0,If you want to only wear it once go for it.
1.0,Broke as soon as they where in
1.0,"Does not cover at all, to small, not a good product but a good idea"
1.0,Displeased! The description says silver it came 8 rows silver an the rest dull black! Not what I asked for!
1.0,Super shiny silky like material that looks just like Grandma's nightgown it did not look like that in the picture The neck is so wrong I bought a medium and should have gotten an extra small because they must be oversized again the picture didn't look like that very disappointed in this shirt.
1.0,Poor craftsmenship.  The pink pair tore up the seam the first time I put them on.  I hope the seller will replace.  But I have not heard back.  :-(
1.0,Too big and the quality for the money is not worth.
1.0,Poor quaility
1.0,"I would leave zero stars if I could.  They do not accept returns, and they should note that in the description.  Their smallest size (4) is obviously way too large.  It's like a large rather than xs."
1.0,Good color and comfortable band but sad thing is that the metal peace came a part in less then one month🙁
1.0,the wood on the inside came unglued immediately.
1.0,Touch screen did not work with this screen protector.
1.0,Flimsy. straps too long without a way to adjust.
1.0,Described as &#34;2pcs&#34; but only 1 in package!!
1.0,Wore it for Halloween and ripped within 2 hours. Horrible buy.
1.0,"This ring is cute but when you put it on, the butterflies cut into your skin. Very uncomfortable."
1.0,It is pretty but didn’t look good with the watch face as well as it’s so thin it makes the face of the watch look pushed out. I did return for a refund.
1.0,I got these as a gift and the person asked to return them because the material was bad. Its too bad because the design is super cute.
1.0,I didn't remove any of the dirt on my boots I had to order another type of cleaning
1.0,"If you wear them, DON'T EVER WASH THEM!!  JUNK!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Arrived promptly heavier than expected gems fell off after wearing twice very upset about that.plus they were attached on crooked.
1.0,The dress was very poorly made! That is actually being nice. Then the picture made it look like a regular cotton material and it ended up being a wool type material. There was strings all over they didn't cut off and places where it was buckled up because they didn't see it correctly. I will never buy from this company again.
1.0,How is any human supposed to see out of this?
1.0,"I was really excited about this dress from how the material looked from the photo. I was going to dress it up with nice accessories and killer heels. Unfortunately, in person, it looked like I was getting ready to go do a praise dance. All I was missing was some ribbon and a tambourine. The material was not anything like the photo and extremely bouncy. Not at all the look I was going for."
1.0,These gloves do not function as touchscreen capable gloves.
1.0,"It is incredible how Amazon disguises knockoffs to make them look legitimate. This bottle never loses the toxic plastic taste, and is definitely not the real deal"
1.0,"Very cheap , seller refuse to take it back!"
1.0,Unfortunately it’s not true to size.
1.0,Product completely different from the image on amazon.
1.0,nice quality. I ordered a l/xl...it's more like an extra small! not gonna fit me!
1.0,No support at all and didn’t stick well
1.0,The color is not the same and the shirt has these two pieces stitched where the knot is supposed to be. It's so different than pictured and it's not as advertised. Cheap and ugly! Really big and unnatractive
1.0,"No, just no. They're not cut correctly and there's not way an actual human could wear these."
1.0,"I like the glasses themselves. Decent material and the lenses are lightly blue tented...however, they failed all of the tests I found online to see if they are truly filtering blue light. If you're getting them just for fashion, have at it. But they don't actually work."
1.0,I don't like it. It had a bad oder when it arrived. It was or is too small. I needs a solid bottom because it callapses in my purse. I take something out I have hold it open to put it back. I regret the purchase. No option for no stars.<br />Thanks for asking.
1.0,"Very small and can barely fit a single notebook,  not suitable for school.  Very disappointed"
1.0,"Wish I could give it zero star. Arrived broken. Even if it was not, I would have trash them."
1.0,Broke off in only a few wearings.  And now I'm past the return date.  Stick with the real stuff.
1.0,"I'm not even exaggerating when I say about the 10th time I used this piece of crap, the actual horn part broke off. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1.0,Way too small.  Like child size verses adult size.
1.0,They are terrible the fit bit not a long enough torso. The straps are short and the pants are made funny.
1.0,"Did not come with spring bars, so I couldn't attach it to my wristwatch. Stupid! As for how it works, I won't know until I get my shipment of spring bars."
1.0,"I actually ordered the next size up. When I received I tried them on and they fit. The label does say to hand wash and not dry in dryer … they’re not kidding. Washed on cold, hand wash cycle and hung to dry but they were kinda wrinkled. Threw them in the dryer on low for 10 minutes. Tried them on and they shrunk!  :(  can’t even get them over my hips."
1.0,when was tried on it was totaly see through...nothing said about it being see through when advertised
1.0,"I got these earrings for only the cost of shipping.  Should have been my first clue.  They are beautiful and they really sparkle. The shipping was amazingly fast.  Based on appearance and delivery they are 5 stars.  The main reason I wanted these was for the screw post.  With most screw post earrings, the screw back pushes on, but screws off.  Once the screw back is pushed into place, it does not move unless you push it tighter.  After removing these earrings once from my ears, that was the end of the screw off capability.  The back slides like greased lightning.  The earrings look great when the back is pushed to my ear, but within seconds the back slides and the earring droops and is ready to fall off."
1.0,"It's not that it was to small, I think it's the material it shows every single lump and bump. The sleeve length was great, so if you order....size up definitely"
1.0,"The description of this product clearly states 16 pieces but you only get four bracelets.  I am not sure what they define as a ""piece.""  The description is completely misleading.  I would not order from this seller again."
1.0,The dress is too thin and the neck piece is slack
1.0,"Picture must better than actual bracelet.  It is easy to open, close and adjust.  I’m so sad that it is so cheaply made."
1.0,Not what I expected coming from Amazon. Small and flimsy.
1.0,"At first I absolutely loved this blouse! It was so cute, fit perfectly, and was comfortable! I have a hard time finding blouses that fit all three criteria. I washed it on a gentle cycle hoping to wear it for the first time the following day. When I went to hang it up I noticed the seems connecting the sleeves to the body were fraying! On both sides! I am so disappointed. I’ve bought other Merokeety products and had great luck so I figured this would be the same. Hopefully this was just a fluke and won’t happen with other blouses."
1.0,Great product.it’s about $1.03 a mask. I couldn’t find a better price and feel well protected at the same time…. Don’t look for anything less costly… Being cheap is expensive. Especially in regards to your health
1.0,The other two are perfect but the Art Attack Silvertone Horses Make My Life Whole Horseback Cowgirl Lucky Horseshoe Animal Pet Pendant Necklace WAS going to be a graduation gift but the chain is broken very dissatisfied...
1.0,The top was three sizes too small and the pants are so big that they won’t stay up!
1.0,"The description of this item is completely inaccurate. Yes, it looks like the suit, but, it’s not stretchy or soft and the sizing is way way off. I am 5’6, 36C, 28 waist and 34 hips. I’m a personal trainer with a lean athletic build and from all accounts a medium should have fit me. It does not. Maybe I could have gotten away with a large. Maybe. But the material is scratchy with no stretch. The top barely covers my nipples. I’ll give it away to my small petite friend. If you must have it, I’d highly suggest ordering a size or even two up. So disappointed!"
1.0,Very very very very very very very very very very very small. Size is waaaay off!
1.0,Ordered this three different times because it was too small. I got the 38 and it's not even the same thing.
1.0,"It was huge, and it hit well above my ankles. I am slightly taller than average height (5'6-5'7), but this would have been on a 5'3 person. Don't waste time or money on this cheaply made, awful product."
1.0,"I received the Real Love 3-Pack of Girls T's today.  The two white t-shirts have black and blue ink stains all over them.  I have ordered a replacement pack and hope the new pack will be without stains.<br /><br />As far as shirt quality, I am very pleased with the material and thickness of these t-shirts.  It is hard to find good quality material for children's plain t-shirts.<br /><br />I would also agree with other reviewers who said these t-shirts run small.  I ordered one size up for my slender 11 year old.  She normally wears a 10/12 in t-shirts.  I ordered the 14/16 in these and they fit her well.<br /><br />My advice is to have quality control better check these t-shirts for flaws more effectively."
1.0,I would not buy these again. Within 3 months the thin plastic wrap is coming off all of the cups making them all white. Not real sturdy. Next time I will spend more money on a more durable cup that has printing on it and not a plastic sleeve.
1.0,I was super disappointed when I received this. It was missing a rhinestone. Cheap.
1.0,"They broke as soon as I put them in my ears. The back of it came off. I am not paying to have these returned. If I received a damaged item. I was very pleased with their decision, so I just figured I’d suck up the money for it cause I’m not paying to send them back."
1.0,The two metal rings that for the band that wrap around your leg are always folding causing discomfort. Only wore them once.
1.0,Band was not great quality or even close to the color pictured. Already working on returning it as it is not going to be an item that is easily wearable or usable.
1.0,"Was easy to connect, looked great, but didn't last 12 hours before the pin at the base of the buckle ripped out of the strap."
1.0,Within first few weeks the side seam came undone so my wife stitched that back...and now the elastic is nearly broken near where it attaches to the mask.
1.0,This dress is not fitted. I ordered a Medium and it fit like and XLarge. I would recommend going down a size or two unless don't want to have any shape when wearing it.
1.0,"The device the adjust the length of the belts hurts when in use.  You can be sitting down,  sloughing or lying down,  and this device hurts against your skin,  even if there is clothes in between."
1.0,"These glasses were extremely cheap. The kind that your hair gets stuck in the hinge and feels like they should have cost a two dollars at the dollar store.  On top of that I returned them, got refunded as they had been given to the UPS store, they don't refund until they receive UPS notice and they claim they have not received them so are charging me again. DO NOT BUY THESE GLASSES."
1.0,The description says that the larger umbrella is 23.5 inches in diameter but when it arrived i measured it to be only 21 inches in diameter. Because of this I will be returning them.
1.0,It fell apart less then a week after I got it. But it was cute while I had it.
1.0,"Horrible! Muy mala calidad, parece plastico. Ademas quedo enorme, los tamaños no se corresponden con lo publicado. No la pude usar."
1.0,Doesn't fit and not at all flattering
1.0,Waiting 3 weeks for this band to come and it doesnt even fit the watch 🙄
1.0,Came in defective the lights do not work
1.0,"This item is VERY CHEAPLY made. I expected as much considering the price. However, I had hoped it would make it through at least one wear.<br /><br />I purchased this to wear for my Halloween costume. So, for the first time I opened the package today and began my test run for tomorrow night. The fake turquoise just popped right off! This item would be fun if it didn't break the first use.<br /><br />Furthermore, the cuff is ridiculously large. I am 5'10"" and even my wrists are too dainty to support it.<br /><br />My advice: Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. And don't get your hopes up if you do."
1.0,item fits a childs head!! NOt an adult- Seller needs to list this important fact so that buyers are not disappointed!
1.0,This shirt was way too small and the part of the fabric that was supposed to be printed on felt like a different material than the rest of the shirt like a thick floppy cheap rubber.  Eww.
1.0,way way way to small does not fit what  is shown way to small
1.0,"fit like regular cotton leggings you can buy at target or kohls, not good for running unless you like to jiggle"
1.0,Not as cute at all
1.0,Looks cheap. Not flattering.
1.0,"Left my wallet at first, was the perfect size. Fit multitude of cards plus cash. But one of the zippers broke and got stuck under the leather tab at the bottom after only 2 weeks use. Had to cut the bottom open to get my zipper and credit cards out. Not happy."
1.0,Batteries did not last very long!

1.0,"Terrible product, does not fit comfortably"
1.0,"Ok so I ordered three pairs of these shorts. The pink ones, purple and grey ones. Each one was wildly different sizes but all labeled an XL. Girl I’m a large at old navy. These  XL bottoms were not able to fit over my calves.<br />Sad day man ):"
1.0,Feels like a damn Halloween costume horrible material!!! Cheap! Do not buy!
1.0,"This top was disappointing. Poor quality materiel , Threads hanging. But it was a cheap price, so .... whatever.  I would not repurchase."
1.0,Too small need an XL
1.0,Glasses arrived quickly. No problem there. Bought them for my husband who has been complaining his night vision. Was hoping these glasses would make a difference. We both tried them and neither one of us could tell a difference. Would send them back but tossed the packaging.
1.0,This bag is sturdy from outside but the inside lining is too bad. The stitches are ripped off after a few times and the threads are all coming out from the inside lining. Wanted to return it but don't see the option.
1.0,Arrived broken and I waited too long to send back.  :/
1.0,Quality is cheap.
1.0,I give it one star because I actually received it .<br />It is not the color I ordered or the quality expected  it's not even the shape or length.<br />Actual item does not look like the pictured item what so ever .
1.0,"I am so bummed right now! I was loving how beautiful this was, but after only a few days this has broke! And not only that, but I see from the image online that I received a defective keychain that came with only half the rhinestones. I can see that someone used hot glue to reattach the half of rhinestones that I did receive. I will not order from this company again."
1.0,"Covered what it needed to on my size Gs, and adhesive was very strong, but not strong enough for any kind of lift."
1.0,Shoes didn't have the leather lining
1.0,This ring is not what I expected. Hollow inside ring which grabs the finger sliding on and off. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,VERY awkward weird unflattering fit and cheap looking. Basically a waste of my money
1.0,"It's not a free range of motion, soft sweatshirt. It's restricting through the shoulder blades."
1.0,It' s bad.
1.0,Broke right away. Don't recommend.
1.0,Complete Trash! It was supposed to go in a Christmas stocking but I would be embarrassed to give anyone this junk!
1.0,the necklace as you can see is rusted. i will have to return it for a refund. was forced to give it a star.
1.0,I am 5'3&#34; 135lb. Purchased a large. Was too short in the arms. Also extremely thin with very shiny silver zippers. Returned immediately.
1.0,Wore it 3 times and it starts to turn brown
1.0,Its like a pair of boxers. It's too thin.
1.0,These break very easily.  I tried to use one to add to my zipper pull and it fell apart right away.
1.0,Mine came with a hole right in front in the top. Will definitely be returning it...
1.0,"I had to throw these in the trash after wearing them once. These shorts left a raised red circle around both of my thighs where the elastic tape gripped to prevent from rolling. They weren't too tight. And while I was wearing them, all I noticed was a vague chafing feeling. (I was sitting at a desk for most of the day in an air-conditioned office.) The welts really hurt and lasted FIVE (5) DAYS! I'm allergic to nothing but penicillin--so... Will think twice before purchasing more Spanx products."
1.0,"Arrives wrinkled from packaging and then impossible to get wrinkles out.  After numerous tries and various methods the wrinkles are permanent.<br />Also, the color (red) also rubs off on everything."
1.0,The swivel hook became detacked from the key fob within a week of receiving it. Luckily it fell off just as I was entering the house otherwise I would have ever known. I put some superglue on the screw and reattached it. Why didn't I send it  back you might ask. Well orange is my favorite color and it is a pretty shade of orange.
1.0,Broke easily and cheap
1.0,Pom Pom fell off immediately upon taking hat out of the plastic. Material felt cheap. So returned product.
1.0,"The posts and backs were black. I was hoping it was just silver tarnishing but when I tried to polish them, they stayed black. The picture is after polishing."
1.0,"Well, I bought these to wear at out martial arts winter retreat.  I was thinking, nice, loose fitting pants to wear around the retreat center.  Comfortable enough to sit through lectures, and loose enough to do physical classes.  Well, the reality is, of all the pants I bought, only one survived being washed, and the others ripped from gentle use.  I thought at first it was just one pair, and the others would turn out fine.  Nope, happened with them all."
1.0,"This product have bad quality<br />I bought a large, the top was like an extra large with the pants as a small."
1.0,I couldn't even get my foot inside the boot and I ordered my thu l right size.

1.0,I received this item broken.
1.0,it's nice but it came broken. Can u change it ?
1.0,It was a cheap really poorly advertised toy that I was disappointed with. My grandson was really disappointed. Don’t buy this
1.0,Stopped working 2 weeks after purchase
1.0,"They came broke. It had one nose piece, the other one was not in the box."
1.0,"Bathing suit is not as pictured. Fringe are not as long as pictured, very disappointed!!"
1.0,"it is ugly and looks nothing like the photo in person. Loose, too thin, and very low cut"
1.0,I used it once it stopped working it also gets Sylvia inside were the battery goes
1.0,Very poor quality.  Sewing is poorly done.  Material is very cheap cotton and sizing is off.
1.0,Pants are almost see through and the material does not move with your movement. They recommend ordering a size up. Just don't order them if you are larger than a size (US) 5.
1.0,This runs REALLY big and very very long(I'm 5'8) and doesn't give you much of a shape. The arms are super tight though. Seems to be way out of proportion. Returned it.
1.0,zipper does not stay up
1.0,I’m really upset with the order I received. The picture showed a space pattern but this is what I got....solid bright colors which is very different. Would not buy from them.
1.0,"Too tight and the clips don’t stay closed. I returned it,"
1.0,The watch is not waterproof only resistant.
1.0,All the fuzz is coming out and elastic sucks.
1.0,"I was hoping the badly photoshopped picture wasn't a clue but I was wrong. This is at least 2 sizes to small, even with the stretchy fabric. The arms, however,  are super long. Sorry. This didn't work out."
1.0,Too big. I wasn't expected this big size. I need to return it.
1.0,Does not fit adult.  Ad does not say for children.  Seller was cool & refunded me.
1.0,"The gloves are very thin, and easy to tear. They are not as advertised. Very disappointed they are not worth the price."
1.0,"Very cheap material and poorly made. One of the straps broke the first time I put it on.  Had I not waited to long to try it on, I would have returned it"
1.0,Too heavy the point downward
1.0,"Go to Joann fabric and pick out any fabric you like, sew a seam up the side and I will be better than this even if you have never sewed a day in your life."
1.0,Over priced for how poor the quality of the shoe
1.0,"the circles are not consistant, the shapes are off, i would not recommend this very cheap looking, do not waste your time and money"
1.0,They are NOT one size fits all
1.0,"This laptop booted up fine out of the box.  I transferred several of my files from my old Dell laptop, then it requested a needed update due to out dated software.  I initiated the update and the laptop never worked after that - black screen.  I went to the ASUS support website and initiated a chat session for assistance.  The actions they directed were unsuccessful.  I initiated a maintenance service request and was informed I would receive an email with further instructions, but have not received the email after a week.  I was surprised and disappointed that the laptop could not be started in a safe mode and the system restored.  The update was obviously the problem."
1.0,Completely see through. Short. Looks like a nightgown.
1.0,This band broke my wrist out in a nasty rash which now has left behind scars.
1.0,I threw them away.  They turned black and turned my ears black!
1.0,"Very cheaply made, pictures are misleading..."
1.0,I was really excited for this dress to come and then it arrived and I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the light seafoam green in the picture and it came bright turquoise. nothing at all like the picture. It also runs extremely small and was way off on sizing.
1.0,Doesn't fit my neck. Too large and unadjustable.
1.0,"Pretty much fits..... minus it being sewn on what seems like two tree trunks. Huge legs and oddly low/high(?) extremely small waist. Belt too skinny, length too short."
1.0,"the pants look great from a far, but they are not good to work out. they continue to slip down while working out, one has to continuously pull them up. It is very unconfortable."
1.0,"In the pictures of the women holding the bag it is clearly oversized, but the product I received is very small. Sent it back immediately. so disappointed, you would think Amazon would make sure the descriptions were accurate!"
1.0,"Is this one size fits all? I really wanted to get this costume, but there are not any size options listed. This costume is listed by several other sellers and none of them have sizing options listed."
1.0,Delivered broken and there is no return policy
1.0,"This item looks nothing like advertised, I ordered an extra large so it was be loose and comfy dress style and Im not a big person and its extremely small. also this image portrays that it will have pockets and it does not. Awful item will never purchase from this company again. And would recommend not to."
1.0,Completely wrong size! Ordered infant 3!
1.0,The sequence on the dress caught on others…..so I can only imagine what would happen if I put it on. 😞
1.0,It’s not 925 sterling silver. It’s a Big FAT lie
1.0,The dress received is short and does not look like the one in the picture.
1.0,"I ordered this dress based on reviews that it was very loose fitting. However this particular dress was very form fitting and a terrible, cheap fabric. I had to write the company 2 times for a return and the return label they provided me was almost the whole cost of the dress! It was not even worth the money to return and they would not allow anything different for an exchange in another size. I will not order from this company again"
1.0,2 out of the 3 I ordered BROKE!!!
1.0,Too small.  I didn't like
1.0,"Sizing is way off, extremely disappointed in this shirt. I wanted it so badly, and loved the look of it in the picture. But it does not lay like the picture and it is very short. I am an average person wearing a regular med to large. This will not work and does not fit. Just so upset over this."
1.0,"Again, I did not recieve this... I only recieved a very short lace wrist bracelet with a ring! It (in no way) was a sleeve... Does not look like the picture.<br />I had to give it one star in order to rate this, otherwise I wouldn't give it one star!"
1.0,Too large poorly made
1.0,"I thought these would be small but they made me look like a bull. And the rings are way to thick, i couldn’t get them through my piercing comfortably.<br /><br />I also only got 6, not 9."
1.0,Shoes are falling apart and look cheap. I’ve returned these to Kohls Amazon return counter. Seller said I didn’t need to return but to gift them. I chose to return. Now seller won’t acknowledge my return!
1.0,"They sent the wrong length, full length not cropped. Way to big!"
1.0,I wonder what the inner metal is. They are awfully heavy. I do not like them.
1.0,"I don’t know HOW you can make underwear this ugly, unflattering AND uncomfortable! The leg openings are disturbingly small! I looked like a person made of strung-together marshmallows, or someone who had their legs cut off and poorly re-attached. The ONLY positive I can come up with is these will prepare you for wearing adult diapers later in life. And the horrible cliwn colors and pattern!!! Good lort, no one over 12 wants polka dot underwear!!!"
1.0,"I know nothing about this belt because I couldn't wrap it around my body.  I bought the 44 inch belt and it is 44 inches INCLUDING the buckle.  And of course the holes don't start until at least 2 inches from the end, the my 44 inch belt is effectively a 40 inch belt, best case scenario."
1.0,"Doesn't work. I think we received someone else's reject - tags were torn and not attached, ears don't flip up at all. Too bad - cute hat and concept, but it's going back."
1.0,These flip flops are cute; but they are at least 2 inches too large. I ordered a size 9 women's; these for my husband who wears a men's 11.
1.0,"Thought these looked cute for my daughter and ordered a pair. Washed on normal before first time wear and noticed that before moving them to the dryer the strings had unraveled on the draw strings causing them to immediately fray. Looking closer, the strings are coming out of other draw strjng too so these will fray even further. See picture for more details. I'm disappointed because she hasn't even tried these on yet and after a single wash they are already deteriorating. I will not purchase these again."
1.0,"Not sure if I ordered the wrong size or what but these pants don't stay up. I am constantly pulling them up while working out, not cool. I'm normally a medium so that's what I ordered. They fit but don't stay up once I start moving."
1.0,Soooo hard to close
1.0,"wrinkle city and way to small, hated it, sorry"
1.0,I think I would love this jacket but it arrived damaged.  The process of returning it is going to be a giant pain and I hope I get a refund.
1.0,Loved the top. But it was way to small a medium would fit  a litter girl . Plus  recommended dry cleaning. So I gave it to the little girl next-door .
1.0,The black ones were way too small (was labeled L but more like a M). The blue ones had a faulty stitching in the seam at the butt crack. Thank goodness I wasn't in public when I figured that out. The maroon ones are ok.
1.0,Not as shown.....got 3 black....3 gray....maybe next time I should  read the reviews...from the looks of them no one else get the ones shown
1.0,This didn’t fit my MK Bradshaw smart watch
1.0,Craftsmanship sucks
1.0,Poor description. Did not fit.
1.0,These are misshapen and as thin as cheesecloth.
1.0,Outfit not as pictured. Cheaply made and the whole outfit is see through. The gold looks like fake gold.
1.0,Too small . Tiny!  Need to return.
1.0,They're the most cheapest masks I've ever seen paper thin I don't think they'd last once to be washed for it over $20 does for 5 I would never buy the make and a ripoff
1.0,"Watch looked beautiful but seemingly impossible to adjust the size. When we attempted to take out the metal pins to take out the links, the wood broke with both attempts. :( It seems the wood is too fragile to be adjusted. :("
1.0,I am 5'5&#34; and I weigh about 140..I am trying to lose 20 lbs..I think I ordered a medium on this...but..I can't even get it up passed my butt...and I don't have a giant bottom...I don't know...it is just too small...and don't know what to do with it.
1.0,"Way, way too small. Wouldn't even go over my heal. Very disappointed as I love these type so pattern socks."
1.0,Pretty earrings but very disappointed with missing bead. Can’t bother with the hassle of returning
1.0,Broke same day no good 😪
1.0,"I ordered a Large, the blouse was marked XL inside the collar, but it must have been a Small.  I put it on, and it was a 6&#34; space between the buttons and the buttonholes.  It's a beautiful blouse, though.  I am sending it back."
1.0,For something which is built for goalkeepers they got a hole right in the area where you land when you throw yourself.
1.0,"One of them was ripped upon arrival and a couple others came apart at the seams after their first wash. Despite being labeled as the same size, they all fit me very differently. One star is given for the softness of the material."
1.0,Nice looking earrings but the clip does not hold on to the ear well at all. I tried putting body glue to hold it in place and it still falls off my ear.
1.0,"It's not a tight fit.....falls off easily,  not well made"
1.0,The shirt I had received is not the one in the picture.  It is a pink shirt without the cuffs or anything like it.
1.0,Don't like the fabric it's like a shower curtain It's to bad because the style is nice
1.0,Very thin..
1.0,Nothing like the pictures.
1.0,No sale igual como seve enla foto
1.0,Cheaply made! Not worth $31
1.0,"I bought these gloves for my winter commute on my motorcycle; however, these are pretty bad gloves.<br /><br />First off, they are very slippery when it comes to gripping the handlebars as they have almost no gripping friction on the inside of the palm. This is a deal breaker since this is the most important part of riding a motorcycle, having proper grip on the handles.<br /><br />I tried to use these on one commute and never used them again due to the aforementioned reason. They might be good for anything else other than wearing them while riding a motorcycle."
1.0,My daughter said it doesn’t stay in her crocs. Constantly falling out while she’s walking.
1.0,Its very cheaply made it looked like something out of a quarter machine I wouldn't spend that much for cheap looking jewlrey
1.0,Very disappointed in these earrings...THEY ARE TINY! especially for $13 ... They are very dainty You can lose them quite easily. these look like they are made for a newborn that's how small they are.
1.0,Awful. It keeps falling down and there is some piece of plastic in the middle that bothers  me
1.0,"Unfortunately, this dress only looks good if you have B cups or less."
1.0,Cheaply made and did not work. Very disappointed!!
1.0,The dress is loose for the size and the zipper was broken when delivered. Would be returning.
1.0,"This material was the worst. Too baggy, felt like I was wearing a poncho. Very cheaply made. Returned."
1.0,Really chinzy
1.0,Ordered a 2xl to fit my Xl 260 lbs muscular male body and received the 2xl size on the tag of the product but in reality it fits a Large small woman’s frame body . The material is also very thin so not a item I would request anyone purchase to fend off any cold weather .  The graphics look great but all in all I won’t be purchasing another or returning the one I got since my girlfriend confiscated it as her own now . Well played and lesson learned won’t buy another falsely marked item as this ever again .
1.0,"Omg. Nothing is what the description states!  Its TINY, definitely not a tote, badly made and thin.  The zippers in front are just decorative.  The color is way off.  It isn't a cheap price tag but it's a cheap bag.  So disappointed!  Just got it today and going straight back."
1.0,"Way too big, the top would be good for anyone with A large chest but the rest of us there was waaaay to much fabric."
1.0,"Poor fabric quality, scarf sheds over everything and have not washed it yet. Would not recommend."
1.0,"So, My package arrived 20 minutes ago. I immediately tore into it and chose my sizes and cleaned them with alcohol. The first one I tried to open snapped in half...the second one I tried to open snapped in half...the third one I tried to open, opened- but when I tried to snap it shut, it refused to line up and bent...<br />I now have gone through 3 pair out of the set and they are all broken. Want them back because they are literally in pieces! Do not buy these... very cheaply made. Big loss of my money on my part."
1.0,"poor quality, the second time I use it and it breaks, 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
1.0,Horrible don’t buy
1.0,"I like the ones I received and the packaging Case well done very well, but I’m two containers short of what I ordered. I don’t want to return I like the ones I received, but where’s the rest of them????"
1.0,"The shirt was slashed both on the front and back, it would cost too much to return as I have left US, so a waste of money, they need to check more before shipping"
1.0,"I thought this would be a great band for Apple Watch series 3 but I got a rash on my wrist from the material of the watch band,after two days of use. And to top it off I got rusted .I’m very disappointed! Just terrible and customer support has not made one attempt to contact me..."
1.0,Broke as soon as I took them out of the package. Cheap
1.0,Very poorly made. There’s even a “10” written on one of the shoes that I have tried to wipe off with no luck. It’s incredibly big as you can see compared to a true size 10. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,It is very pretty but it is hard to fashion because it is too short to thread the band though the opening.
1.0,I bought the small for size 4-6. I am 5”10 and weight 220lbs and it’s almost too large for me. Don’t buy this for child’s costume or you will be very disappointed
1.0,I got this to help reduce the appearance of my post baby belly and thighs. Instead it lifted my rear a little more than it already was. It didn't do a thing for my belly and thighs other than smooth it out (very little.) For all of the work it takes to put this thing on it didn't really do much. *I ordered the right size according to the companies guidelines for fitting.
1.0,"I purchased two of these dresses in different colors.  The fabric is awful and cheap.  Won’t wear it outside my home.  I think they had the right idea, but ruined everything with the chosen fabric.  They are just ugly. Returning stuff is a hassle so I guess I’ll donate them."
1.0,Horrible horrible horrible product! ! It broke the second it came out of the package! Beyond pissed off and my daughter was heartbroken . Christmas present ruined!
1.0,I look like I am pregnant with this dress. The problem is I am not pregnant.
1.0,"Open the bag, the swimwear are dirty  ，dirty is ok the worst thing is missing one chest cup very disappointed"
1.0,What the hec missing Removable crush-proof AC-adaptor garage. Send it out!!!
1.0,"These pants run small, and are very thin to the point of being sheer in places."
1.0,"The material and fit were okay BUT They forgot to sew the front and back together! See pictures attached, if I tried to wear this it would just fall off since it’s not properly made! Not as pictured! Super disappointed! Do not order this product it is defective! I will be returning it!"
1.0,"Was super beautiful but latch would not close right and fell out after a few days, just wasted my money for nothing because I don't have it anymore."
1.0,Too tight. Not enough give in the adjustment straps. Plastic isn't comfortable around waist. Wish I never purchased. Not made for a plus size person.
1.0,Did fit as expected
1.0,They came as studs with no ball. I ended up bending them for L shaped nose rings.
1.0,"Lasted a week! My son fell and the pins came out, band came off. I thought I fixed it, but next day he came home from school without the watch. He didn't know where it fell off. $40 later  I don't even have a watch to return.<br /><br />It was the most awesome watch in the week we had it. My son can't remember to go potty at school. It was so severe, we were contemplating pulling him out or sending him to the nurse at recess. This watch solved it!! He loved it. We set the alarms based on his schedule. And it was working!!!!! For a week. I can't buy a new watch every week. 👎"
1.0,Trash
1.0,its like they are selling the skeleton of a jogger. I wouldn't recommend
1.0,Came with one of the straps broken
1.0,This scarf looks pretty enough in the pictures but what you don't see is the other side of the scarf. I ordered a green Christmas scarf. The back side is white! So cheap looking that i am returning it immediately! it is not a true scarf fabric but more like a curtain panel. Definitely not worth the money. Buyer beware!
1.0,Absolute joke. Flimsy. Cheap. No battery pack. (sold separately?)
1.0,Poor construction.  Didn't last more than 4 months and it just lived in my pocket for the majority of the time.  Credit card compartment was only partially attached and only at the top at two small anchor points.  Glue leaking from the seams and very very poor stitching.  Will be needing another wallet because this one is pretty much disintegrating.
1.0,This item is not at all like pictured.  It had to be made of thinnest material made. It doesn't even fall like the model shows. Colors are even off.
1.0,"Product runs very small, I purchased an X large and it fitted as a shirt not as a dress. Very dissapointed =("
1.0,"If you are even a somewhat serious cyclist, you deserve better than this. Spring for a more expensive pair. They are also huge, but sit so high up that they would do little to prevent wind in the eyes from the lower end while cycling."
1.0,"When you put it in your nose you can't get the skull piece in, it's really hard to slide in. a waste of money."
1.0,Cute in the photos but not in person. The material is shiny and cheap. I sent it back the next day.
1.0,"I love the style of this dress, but the fabric print is too busy and not flattering! Please make this in some solid dark colors like black & navy!!"
1.0,The letters and pictures on the hoodie rubbed off the first week that she got it
1.0,Garbage.dont waste your money.
1.0,"I ordered this for a 210 lb 5'5&#34; woman to wear as a cover up.  The sides are open; it feels like a hospital gown.  And it was too big anyway, in addition to being hideous."
1.0,Poor fitting
1.0,Missing the bow 😔
1.0,"It's sub-par work, at best. Short, stumpy black tee with what looks like a close up of swiss cheese ( middle tree) and 2 of the most screwed up "" flannel"" trees beside it... LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. My kid can do better on the cricut ( she's 3).  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1.0,Why have this if you can't wear it anywhere near water
1.0,I ordered my usual size and it was way too small
1.0,"What does this say, I was excited for this to arrive as I forgot I even ordered it (so long shipping time)<br />Product seem sturdy, however I can not use it as I don’t know how to read this language.<br /><br />Seller refunded a small amount and I can keep the product"
1.0,These are so cute in person but rubbed sores on my daughters ears since they were too tight.
1.0,zipper ripped after 2 wears
1.0,Will return
1.0,The seems we're too thick and they melted the open end so there was a hard time next to my ear. I ordered the small and they where too big. Then when I tried to return them the seller made me jump through hoops and it cost almost $4 to send back. Just terrible.
1.0,I didn’t even get my anklet
1.0,This crap waste my money!!!!
1.0,These pants are way toooo small. I ordered a large and couldn’t get it pass my tights I am 5’7 175 lbs
1.0,Looks used and the screen protector came broken.
1.0,"Purchased two and not worth it, one arrived broken would not even open.  The second umbrella was stiff and flimsy really doubt it will do anything.  I will just go buy one from Target.  Returning and will not buy again.  Disappointing."
1.0,I am a 36-B and it squashed me into uniboob. Its not seamless either. I was so happy to get home to take it off!
1.0,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! All had holes within a few months!
1.0,Has a hole
1.0,Had a horrible smell.
1.0,not the same
1.0,Very unhappy with this purchase.<br />As soon as I took the belt out of the package the gems fell off as they were just barley hot glued on.<br />The fabric is cheap and comfortable. Runs very small. I even sized up and it was still too small. Don’t recommend at all.
1.0,"Cute, but took 3 months to get here.  Also, I can't even use it.  Said it would fit my exact watch and does not.  What a waste of money."
1.0,I purchased the umbrella to cover two pool side lounges at the same time. the size is great and the color but quality is not. The post broke and now it leans. I always put the umbrella down each day so it was never exposed to high winds .  I believe the weight of the canopy is just to heavy for the design or I go the bad one.  I tried to contact the seller but yes you guessed it no reply. I you purchase this umbrella good luck.
1.0,This material is of that of car cleaning cloth. It's horrible.
1.0,The dress is of excellent quality however it fits my daughter a little bit too big and the alterations would cost more than the dress itself so I want to return the dress and was told by dressy lady that I would only get 30% of my money back and they suggested I tried to sell the dress myself so I am now in the midst of trying to figure out what to do because nowhere listed anywhere on this website that you only get 30% of your money if you need to return the dress they've basically try to have you not return the dress to not refund you your full money.
1.0,No way to put a chain on this wallet.
1.0,"Looked like a pretty cool product from the pictures and description, but started to fail within the first week.  It hasn't been dropped or anything.  The phone in the case was put underwater to take a video, and there was water inside the case.  The case had popped open in one corner, up on further investigation noticed that there was a crack on the corner.  The front is a soft rubber, the back is a cheap plastic."
1.0,My package was opened and nothing was inside it
1.0,"watch is very cheaply made, it's plastic and mine came with the whole faceplate cracked"
1.0,did not fit had to be given to a friend and the material was inferior
1.0,The outfit is too small and I ordered a large.
1.0,"Ordered an xxl, more like a small."
1.0,"The straps on this are very long and not adjustable, wont stay up. The tank itself is not really a sports bra if you are smaller it comes to my mid waist and the ""bra"" portion is way below my bust even with a small size. With such an odd fit I would say pass for sure is you are a smaller person"
1.0,Chain lasted two months. No matter how I clean it it looks dirty and dark gray
1.0,"I bought this same sock from a different vendor. It is terrible. Sized as 12+, it is way too tight on 13 feet. The sock is not well designed, either for support or compression as advertised. Its just flat and universally tight. Similar socks from Dickies are perfectly comfortable. The material is scratchy and threads (weave) are already unravelling. I can't recommend this manufacturer.  Normally I would have no use for such an uncomfortable sock, but in this case I need disposable socks for a demolition project. Unless you need disposable clothing for a hazmat project, I can not recommend these socks or manufacturer."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:e9349bfdcb1815a6138d0009968f78de]] The quality is horrible, it don’t cover the entire midsection and start sliding down immediately."
1.0,I'm only giving this tie 1 star because it looks good..  However you all should know that they are advertising this as 100% silk AND IT IS NOT!!  This tie is 100% polyester!!  (See attached photos) I would not have bought it if I'd know that... But it's not really worth my time to send it back..  Disappointed!
1.0,I was extremely disappointed with this shirt. On the back of it there is a huge spot that is darker than the shirt. It is really noticeable as well. I really wish it hadn't been defected when I recieved it.
1.0,Horrible chemical smell!
1.0,This coverup is just a piece of flimsy stretchy net.  It’s smelled really musty upon arrival and is basically useless.
1.0,"This shirt was HUGE and made of very, very thin material.  Very poor quality.  The necklace arrived broken and with paint chipping off.  I attempted to return the shirt but the shipping to do so was $22 so instead, I threw it in the trash.  Buy with caution, friends."
1.0,Sizing too big…don’t care for material.
1.0,it came without the suction piece.
1.0,Dress looks like a moo moo not a dress<br />Way way to big.
1.0,"Do not buy it, very poor quality"
1.0,"The clip damaged my glasses lens because the rubber didn’t really cover the iron clip and left scratches on my lens! Big scratches! Who’s gonna pay for the repairing fee? So dispointed.<br /><br />Updates: it’s been four days since I left comments here, however, no one responds. I guess they just don’t care."
1.0,"For little kids, its way too thick."
1.0,nothing like the picture. disappointing
1.0,"I washed it once, and it shrunk two sizes. It was a piece of junk."
1.0,Zero!!!!
1.0,It was so thin that you can not handle it no good
1.0,Sizing is awful .Size Med looks like 00 when you try it .
1.0,Material is so so thin and there so tight.  I ordered 2 sizes bigger because of reviews and there still snug.  More like leggings than jeans but they rip easy.  I will NEVER buy this brand again EVER. Also seams were badly sewn.
1.0,Did not glow in the dark - not even a little bit!
1.0,Cute bathing suit but way too small! My 9 yr old is small for her age and the 10-12 fit like a 6.
1.0,"Please don’t waste your money. They’re horrible quality, super flimsy, and don’t stay on. When I first received them, upon taking them out of packaging I had to bend them to shape because they were all bent up. Once I did that and put them on they just keep falling off. I ordered a new pair from a different vendor the next day and they were way better quality, stronger, and stay in place."
1.0,Very thin and smell bad
1.0,only have 3 monts i sent to warranty and wnet the give me againt have the same problem syop alone
1.0,"The Wallet was cute and I was excited to receive it, but in within 24 hours, I had problems with the zipper.  I had read about the zipper in the reviews and thought it was just a one item issue, it's not.  This product has faulty zippers."
1.0,"I wear a size 12 which is a 32.  So I ordered a 32; HUGH mistake, they were more like a 28.  There was no paperwork to send them back, just a message on the outside of the package to send them back in the original bag.  I donated them to the Salvation Army & went to LL Bean & found the perfect pair!"
1.0,Look at the silver bar and details of the shoe and compare to an actual product of Nike. These are knock-off’s so buyer beware.
1.0,Excited to wear these when I opened the bag they were huge. The plan was to give the other half to my best friend and one of the hoops were missing. I returned them the same day I got it delivered.
1.0,I do not like the material the shorts are made of. Very cheap material.
1.0,Really bad shinny leather looking purse. Looks very playful. Not good at all....unless thats what you are looking for. I adoore the style and wanted it to arrive sooo baddly. But did not like it at all.
1.0,Looked used. Really cheap and poorly made
1.0,Unbearably see thru
1.0,"The suit fit in the body area, but the ruffled sleeves area was way too large that it drooped down and just looked funny. I tried putting it up over my shoulders, even though that's not how you wear it, and it just didn't work. Too bad since it's a cute bathing suit."
1.0,messy look. not attractive.
1.0,They were very easy to install.  The quality did not match the quality of the original lenses from Oakley. When you looked at the ground the lenses made it feel like the ground was warped and wavy.
1.0,"Seller states this St. Christopher medal is 3/4 inch in size, not, the one I received is 5/8 inches.  Don’t tell me something then send something else, worst kind of business.  The chain is very thin vs the pictures depicting something larger.  Also the medal doesn’t say it is a St. Christopher medal with no writing of any kind except “France” on the back.  Looks more like a woman’s medal and definitely not 3/4 of an inch.  Shipping was fast."
1.0,I would if liked for sterling to be a better quality bracelet.  I was very disappointed. I did like the card in the box and the packaging. I only kept it for that reason
1.0,"Order 2 sizes biggervthan what you usually wear. Top is very long!! Comes to the top of my knees.  Im 5'2""."
1.0,Too small and was a crop top on me. Not at all complimentary
1.0,Too small. Very thin material
1.0,I didn’t even make it out the door before it broke :(
1.0,I am usually a small but after reading some reviews I ordered up and got a medium. It is too big. Also the black is so sheer. The material is very thin. I am disappointed. Would maybe work with a slip underneath.
1.0,These are huge! Not little girl earrings like expected and also one came extremely bent!
1.0,My 8 yr. old daughter loves these bows and has plenty. I refuse to buy anymore- they are so cheaply made and for the price???!!!  The center ribbon almost always comes undone. I have to glue it back together on several of her bows!
1.0,These boots are NOT waterproof as stated!!! The first day my son wore them out in the snow his feet were soaking wet.  He told me they were broken and that he needed new boots because his feet were wet :(<br />So very disappointed.
1.0,Not a comfortable when wearing them .. i'm not satisfied
1.0,"I consider these socks to be more expensive than what I usually pay for socks. I wore them once, washed them and they have already begun having holes in them. My feet are an average size 8 and i didnt do anything abnormal in wearing them. This is very disappointing"
1.0,"Returned item, it made me look like a tourist. Easy game for a pick pocket."
1.0,For the price you are better off buying Smiths or Oakley.  The technology is nice but so disappointed that Dillon Optics doesn't stand behind their product.  Purchased a fantastic pair of glasses less than a year ago. Only worn intermittently and babied the entire time.  The coating has begun to degrade. Admitted that they know the coating can wear off sometimes but that is not covered by warranty.  Better to spend your money with a company that stands behind their products.
1.0,Broke at the site where it connects to the watch
1.0,"Not as described: much larger (12.7mm actual, not 9mm); no box.  Arrived damaged since not packaged in box for shipment (even though a gift box is part of description); instead was shipped in folded paper in flimsy plastic bag.  No 925 markings present to indicate it is sterling silver. Arrived very late even with Prime shipping."
1.0,Did not like the material. Doesn’t fall right on legs.
1.0,"This item was like wearing a black garbage bag. It looks nor fit anything like the picture. The legs were not tapered at all, it was as if I was wearing a onesy that someone cut the feet out of."
1.0,"Purchased this as a bridal shower gift and was shipped me the wrong item. It came with two items that said “bride”, and unfortunately the tote said “bride squad”.<br /><br />Because of this error, I was unable to give the gift to the bride at her shower. I will be returning this item. Would not recommend."
1.0,not as appears in picture
1.0,"For the price, I knew this wasn’t going to be a precious thing but when the description says “glass”, don’t give me uber-cheap plastic!"
1.0,Love the shoes.  Too bad I got both for the left foot.  Ordered them again.  Really like them
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:35bc6285847f5859820c075a0cd8239]] The watch doesn’t work the hands do not move, this was going to be my wife’s Christmas present!"
1.0,This product must have come from overseas. I purchase a 2XL and it was two small for my grandson.
1.0,Not somewhat small.  Sizes off and not anywhere the size as stated.
1.0,"The lining is tight and the outer layer is puffy, so it looked terrible on me. It doesn’t look like the pic in person at all, the cut it different."
1.0,"I bought the umbrella because of the pretty color and the fact that its semi-see through but it broke within a very short time. I didn't have to use it right away but after about the second use the inside frame broke in 2 places, the ends were coming off, the handle was scratched after the first use and it was too late for me to return it. Not a very high-quality product for the price you are paying."
1.0,I ordered the +1.25 &amp; recieved +2.75. Sent back &amp; reorderd from another seller. Dissapointed as I absolutely love the style of these reading glasses.
1.0,I purchased this for my wife and she was so happy that not only did I get her a very nice looking clutch but functional as well. Well it was just that looks good but after verily using it for less than 2 months the zipper gave out in the middle of a transaction and she lost not only the contents but now the clutch will not zipp up completely as it was dislodge from its original state- Not very happy.
1.0,"I ordered xx large,  too big. I wear large, get x large."
1.0,NOT REAL
1.0,Way too small . Sizing is off. Doesn't fit big busted women
1.0,The sleeves of this shirt are very small!  The shirt fit well everywhere else.  Can’t wear it though because the sleeves look ridiculous!
1.0,poor quality material and poor workmanship. I returned but did not get a full refund even though the shirt was in its original wrapping. Do NOT order
1.0,"Came in much smaller size, not even near closing, I ordered for a 34&#34; waist, it came at 30&#34;, 10&#34; from closing at the bottom of abdomen"
1.0,Came with two beads off
1.0,Broke taking the backing off Christmas morning before my granddaughter even got a chance to wear them. So disappointing! She loved them.
1.0,It didn't work and it shocked my tongue when I put it in would not recommend
1.0,Not at all sexy comfy like what’s in the pic.<br />As usual you get this boxey ugly material!
1.0,Didn't work long wouldn't buy again
1.0,"Terrible quality. They are not all cut the same size. Some are much tighter than others. Thin and scratchy material. Terrible customer service, they completely ignored my 2 emails. Would NOT recommend these to anyone."
1.0,"Arrived broken and honestly NOT worth your money. Saw these at a store in pismo and bought them here, nope total regret. Zero stars really."
1.0,The picture shown is a full sleeve jacket... I email and invoice says &#34;elbow sleeve length&#34;!?! That is NOT what is pictured!  This item will be returned !
1.0,I bought 6 sets and only received 4 so now I can’t use them because 2 of my bridesmaids wouldn’t get one.
1.0,"Sticker placed right on the product. It wouldn’t come off, trying to get it off is causing pulls and stretching out in one spot. Otherwise great product"
1.0,It was to small and did not came on time
1.0,Ive only used this bag for a month and its fallen apart. The top near the zipper has ripped near the seams. Not really enough storage space.
1.0,This product does not fit the Samsung mm42 even though the description says it does. Tried to send back but haven't heard anything in 3 days!
1.0,Terrible quality haven’t even had it for a month and it’s falling apart.
1.0,The hanging toiletry bag is SO much smaller than it appears in the picture it’s as tall as a tube of toothpaste! Items had a smell of “old basement” when arrived. Not happy with purchase. Used once and zippers have broken on 3 of the bags
1.0,Seriously so cheap and messy. I cant imagine this would work for ANYONE.
1.0,This is cheap plastic. Cute cheap plastic.
1.0,Multiple words are misspelled. This is a terrible bracelet! I even thought it was just a typo and asked for a replacement detailing how the words should be spelled. I was sent a duplicate with the same grammatical errors.
1.0,"Very poor quality. It was too large. It did not work and I returned it. Only one of the winders functioned. Very complicated programming with no information specific to a given watch. If the watch is good enough to protect in this way, get a decent winder from a jewelry store."
1.0,Didn't  stay on
1.0,"There was a scratch across the front, and it smelled so strongly of chemicals."
1.0,Cheap and way too small. The price matches the suit  CHEAP!!!
1.0,"I was so excited about this sweater order, exactly what I had been looking for.  NOTHING like what is pictured.  Also, the smell was a cross between barnyard animals and the worst body odor imaginable.  I wrote the seller because it smelled toxic.  Was told that all new items have a ""peculiar"" smell and need to be soaked in detergent for 30 minutes before washing them.  No, this was a toxic smell.  RETURNING."
1.0,The chart lies. I bought the largest size and it didn't even fit my three-year-old nephew properly.
1.0,Biggest piece of crap I've ever purchased; Do not purchase this! Not like picture shows!!
1.0,Poor craftsmanship<br />Pay more for the real thing.
1.0,"It looked good for the most part, a little bit confusing but ok."
1.0,I'm disappointed with the color.  It's actually a prism blue.  The colors are radiating from dark purple to neon green to light yellow then dark blue.  It feels thin compared to the original lenses.  I already found a spec of scratch on the left lens (see picture) not even 5 minutes from opening the package.  Don't buy this product.  I think these lenses will NOT last long.
1.0,These are horrible to get on and cut off the circulation to your feet
1.0,It’s not giving me options for size<br /><br />Hats and Gloves<br /><br />Size chart provided<br />But no option to pick
1.0,Chain broke the second time worn
1.0,"instead of looking like the union jack,  it just  looked like a big red cross"
1.0,Bought 3 sizes for my 2 girls because I was unsure which my oldest would fit into. They were all the same style but different color yellows.
1.0,"Sorry Humble Chic, but these are nothing like pictures. Way too big. The Druzy center looks like it is about to fall off and they are obviously plastic. I really wanted to like your stuff, but I will not spend another dollar on this crap"
1.0,It broke right when I put it on. The lock in two pieces  nice yet broke :( thank you very much
1.0,Horrible fabric. Pilled during first wear. Problematic of both dresses of this design.  I purchased 2 from seller. They were both awful. Terrible quality. Looked great out of the box but then developed 1000’s tiny balls all over.
1.0,This shirt is very ill fitting.  The torso fits but the sleeves are way too long.  Just very awkward!!!!
1.0,I was going through my previously bought orders and this did not fit my ear at all and now it’s roaming around somewhere. Sad it was a waste of money :-/ tried it on my friend and it also wouldn’t fit her ear.
1.0,"They are very comfortable, but the inside thigh Seam ripped the first time wearing"
1.0,Tiny. I bought for a 4 year old. And will have to gift to a 2 year old. Small and made cheap. But have a high cost
1.0,"First off, I loved these earrings. They are as described by seller and are absolutely adorable. However I only gave 1 star for a couple reasons. The smallest pair has one earring that I can't even wear because it doesn't close. Then the middle pair has one earring that I have a very hard time opening because it's so tight/hard to open and I'm afraid it'll break. Soooo here is a 3 pack of earring set and I can only wear ONE SET. I'm very disappointed cause I initially loved them...until I went to wear them. I could return them but it's a pain in the butt to go through the process over 12 bucks so I guess I'm gonna have to be stuck with ONE working PAIR and the other 2 sets not wear. So bummed over this."
1.0,Picture very is very  deceiving.  Cross is Smaller than a dime.  Very disappointed
1.0,"Even though it was supposed to be flowy, it was not."
1.0,Changed review.  Bought last may and only wore for good.  I have had three pairs- still was wearing 2nd pair for every day. Lasted well- last order on zephyr- lasted only a year! The coating on lenses is cracked and peeling off! Lenses cracked at nose piece in center.  Cant use them- obscures vision. What a piece of garbage.
1.0,I never write reviews on products but felt like I needed on this one. I've owned a few pairs of cut resistant gloves for the work I do and these gotta be the worst fitting gloves I've ever worn. The fingers are short and tight but the palm fits way looser than it should've been. These are going from the packaging straight into the garbage as it's not really worth my time to go to the trouble of returning them.
1.0,"Waste of money, the plastic part that comes with the set melted. Could not use it at all."
1.0,These shoes are NOT for wide feet I orders a size 9 and it didn't fit. Soles are a bit hard might be softer once they are broken in but if you have wide feet these are NOT the shoes for you!
1.0,Paper thin. As cheap as they come.
1.0,Bought three sizes all to small
1.0,Cheaply made. Fabric needs a liner!
1.0,It is very small and doesn't fit an adult.
1.0,Did not like the color. I ordered Wine and got this instead. Will not re order. I didnt like the feel of the sweater and it's cut kind of weird.
1.0,Bought for a cruise.  Runs way big and I ordered a size 4.
1.0,So small not that I wanted… and I ordered an XL! Gave it to my boyfriends 14 year old daughter and it fit her!
1.0,"Very, very disappointed. Elastic feels like it is already worn out, fabric is thin and the sizing is way too big.  The front panel is sewn shut where others have it open with a button.  The drawstring is cheap and worthless. I have purchased similar from Target for less money for many years.  They are no longer available so I figured I would try these.  Back to the drawing board :-("
1.0,There are numbers and lines cut into the leather on the brown side.  When the belt is reversed they show.
1.0,Absolutely too thin and wouldn’t last a day on the average person! Sent it back!
1.0,This dress is so poorly made. Seams began shredding on day one. My daughter is paralyzed and bed bound. It was not wear of use. It was the very small on her. She wears a size 10 and it fit her like 4t.
1.0,The manufacturer can’t get the size right on this ring!
1.0,Very Small.  The Picture 's Deceptive In My Opinion.
1.0,Not As described!! Not Sweatpants!!!
1.0,It gets one star because it is probably very warm but It was incredibly heavy. The neck hole was either way too small or the hood was so heavy it felt like it was choking me. Needless to say I sent it back.
1.0,"Worn this maybe 20-25 times and it is falling apart already.  Would not recommend to purchase, poor quality. Should have spent a little more on better quality."
1.0,I’ve bought several similar shirts and all were2X. This 2X was about 2-3 sizes to small in all directions. Looked cute in picture but a disappointment in real time.
1.0,The material was very thin and cheap.
1.0,Very disappointed looked nothing like the picture
1.0,"these are NOT women's underwear, more like very small teenagers."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f465bf5d1a5f638930037ebffc998680]] Looks good but clearly used, only came in some plastic wraps smh 4 the money I paid kmt"
1.0,The material was cheap didn't really like it but didn't feel like sending it back so I kept the material has now gotten the balls on it after one wash
1.0,"It was not what I ordered, doesn’t even look like the picture.  Seriously tooooo Small, arms tooo<br />tight, and extremely tooo long."
1.0,"It says it's adult size but it's anything but. It completely sized foea child's face, it's tiny."
1.0,"Cheap looking ,, I realize it was a cheap bracelet, did not realize it was being shipped rom China.. Braide plastic actually stretches from bod heat.  Flimsy chain, lobster clasp very hard to operate."
1.0,"After a week, the gems came out and scratched the hell out of the roof of my mouth"
1.0,bought a smartwatch made it display the same countdown only much more accurate as it runs on a normal calendar
1.0,Worst product  i've ever had to deal with… Smells fishy which is so disgusting… I've used for breeze glade… Lysol and the other spray you can think of nothing gets rid of the fishy smell… Don't waste your money… Just buy a real name brand item
1.0,Hope it comes back.  It is pitiful.  If it’s heavy rooted it’s not giving any evidence of it from the top side.
1.0,I returned it . Said white but was more vanilla shade of white.
1.0,The straps are way too short and it overall is a weird fit. The fabric is very thin and cheap.
1.0,"Ordered a D cup and it looks more like an A cup, definitely too small and because it didn't digits right it didn't lift them up at all. Maybe in the right size it would lift them but this did nothing for me"
1.0,"1st pair came broken, second pair lasted a couple of weeks and broke again. I cannot return them because the return window closed yesterday. Big bummer"
1.0,"Dead as a doornail after seven weeks! I bought this watch in the middle of April, and by the first week of July it had stopped working. I can't say I was surprised, given the price. I just decided to take a chance on it because it was inexpensive. I guess you get what you pay for and even less! Waste of money!"
1.0,"The logo in the picture/advertisement is 100 times more clear, and legible than what you get. I bought three, and reluctantly keeping 2, and sending back 1 for sure. It is so blurry and unrecognizable, it looks like a very out of focus I don't know what. May as well not have the Triple Horn on there because you can not tell what it is.<br /><br />Update...Returning all 3. The logo on the bracelet faded and darkened to a blob. Just driving 3 hours ro the airport. Not rubbing on anything.<br />Horrible quality, and again, looks nothing like the picture. One was a present for my son...bummer."
1.0,"Poor quality, which includes fabric, packaging of products, colors, and false advertising.  I ordered three large and three medium, and received four large and two medium.  I ordered crew neck only and received a hodge podge of crew neck and v neck all folded together without packaging.  Avoid this seller."
1.0,"easy to use, size is accurate quality sucks! cracks, splits, and scratches in less than a week! peels and frays apart especially at edges! Every belt I ever had split eventually, I've had so many different kinds, but this is one of the worst. Most other kinds last several months before they show wear and tear, and begin to fall apart. This one, like so many must be fake leather, even if it says full grain, or genuine. horrible quality! this is retarded. defective product. It must be poorly spray painted black, to make it look nice at first in china. Its a scam! they shouldn't be able to sell this, and it should be recalled. doesn't even deserve half a star. very sad. I wish I could find a belt that looks like this and lasts forever"
1.0,Arrived broken. Looks very cheap.never worn..too expensive to ship back
1.0,Very disappointed. Wore it once and it changed colour.  So wonder what was meant by it will not fade it will keep its colour. Not fair at all.
1.0,"This is not a Casio product.  No instructions provided.  Poor fit, I do not recommend. DOES NOT FIT G-SHOCK GWM5610-1 or similar GW models.  At $9.99 you might justify taking a chance, at $24.99 steer clear."
1.0,"I couldn’t believe it when I got it, look like hunk of metal. Looked nothing like picture, couldn’t even tell was a butterfly!! I returned it and got a refund.."
1.0,Very floppy would not stay up
1.0,Awful  color.. and smelled like it came from an indian store . as soon as i open it the incence smelled was so strong i got sick to my stomach
1.0,After reading reviews I ordered one size bigger and they are way to big
1.0,They wouldn't stretch enough for me to get them over my feet. Looked good but didn't work for me.
1.0,Not soft or made well. Not XL to 3XL. Offered return at my own expense and only with their label I could not print.
1.0,Got a couple that wasn't working...
1.0,Warning!!!!Don’t buy this item!!!!! Not as pictured!!!! I am still waiting for my money back after shipping the item back for return.
1.0,Way too big! I'm a size 6. This is more like a 10. They're charging me $5 to return. Not worth it!
1.0,Old
1.0,"I bought these as a gift for my Fiancé and after a little over a month of use they're falling apart, the bottom has partially detached on one and the top is ripping off from one side, very displeased by the quality"
1.0,They feel to be good gloves as they are but the electric heat barely makes a difference on or off.. I'm a skier .. so for the price.. which was not extravagant  as true winter gloves can cost. I went back to a pair of Gordinis** with a hand warmer pack with much better results<br />(**Gordinis are not sub zero type garments either but they dont pretend to be something they're not. Add a hand warmer pack either glove will provide comfort into single didgt temperatures )<br />1 star due to my dissapointment in performance with the heat system.
1.0,The fit horribly. Very stiff and uncomfortable. No cushion.
1.0,BROKE IN THREE DAYS AFTER THE SPRING ACTION STOPPED WORKING FIRST
1.0,"Way,way too small!! Was very disappointed!"
1.0,It was delivered broke with no cash strap.
1.0,Cheaply made and falling apart.....a waste of money!#
1.0,Threw them away. Lens fell out after 3 days. Complete junk.
1.0,"I ordered an XL.  This shirt seemed nice, but was definitely NOT a men's size.  It didn't even fit me, and I usually swim in a men's XL.  It may have fit a boy.  I returned it."
1.0,"I guess you get what you payed for, the descriptions seemed like it would be ok for light walks, and getting my Dog used to wearing a pack. WRONG! I put a small book in each side, both together not a pound, the chest strap ripped completely away, tearing the canvas. It's such a pain to return it, I live in a very rural area, that it's not even worth it. I'm just going to eat the $10 bucks. I should have known for 10 bucks I was getting garbage, but the reviews seemed ok. Thought it was a good starter pack. I was wrong. One time out and in the trash it goes!"
1.0,These pads overhang the Freestyle 2 wrist rests; they don't fit correctly. They're also so thick that my wrists are bent when typing.
1.0,"The bag is cute, opened it, placed items in it, stepped out and within 1 hour the entire ""V"" shaped gold piece on the front of the bag fell off. I was not going to carry around this gold plastic all night in my formal wear so I trashed that piece. I noticed a very small screw on one of the ends so maybe they need better screws?"
1.0,Ripped very easily. Very thin.
1.0,"I have the black one and love it so much. Was excited to get silver and gold to dress things up a bit, but they look so cheap and the material feels super weak. I missed the window to return and am so frustrated because there's no way I can wear these. Not good at all!"
1.0,"Terrible tela, se ve todo para adentro. Bad fabric quality, I could it just buy nothing and go showing my breast, that blouse is see through."
1.0,This item would be a maxi dress for people who are under 5ft.
1.0,"All I can do is laugh! I bought an XL, fit like a small."
1.0,"Fit horrible. And when u attempt to return them, you are told they will instead offer u 50% off, as shipping is very expensive back to China. Do not buy this product :("
1.0,Empty box.  No jewelry delivered.  To return would cost me additional shipping.  Total loss.
1.0,I was unable to wear this because I sized it and my wrist was too small. It slid around then unclipped.
1.0,It’s very see through. Very tight. And very unforgiving. Thin fabric. Squeezes my back fat for a nice second pair of breasts.
1.0,"narrow, poorly crafted<br /><br />cheap"
1.0,Cheap garbage.  Broke first time I used it.
1.0,These did not work well with non-pierced ears.  One broke and snapped.  Kind of disappointed considering they were $9.99
1.0,Do not buy this. It is absolute excrement. Not as advertised and there's no way a grown man can fit into it. This is for a 10 year old body. Only giving one star because I have to give something.
1.0,Used for 1 week on vacation and the tan side has all pulls on it very disappointing
1.0,Don't buy this it's crap .it came with holes in them very poor quality
1.0,"Tried sewing the front higher but that didn't work, now it looks terrible. I will keep it and wear it home."
1.0,"These were so hard to zip i had to use pliers to pull the zipper, which broke thepull and now there junk.<br />I used grease and wd40 to lube the zipper. Nothing made it better."
1.0,"Cheaply made, egregiously overpriced, and the seller makes you pay for return shipping."
1.0,"The product is fine, I was getting it for my daughters birthday 6/4. The original delivery date was prior to 6/4, however it did not arrive until several days past her birthday!"
1.0,"Very cheap materials.  On arrival, one of the jewels had fallen out.  Disappointed."
1.0,"The production of the product is very cheap, and the letters have come out after 2 months of wearing it. I wouldn't recommend buying it!"
1.0,Hate it.
1.0,"This shoe looks amazing when new. After wearing it for at least 3 Sundays for the month for 2 hours each Sunday, there are cracks on the top front of the shoe. I definitely won't recommend this to anyone. Waste of money. No durability. If you're buying it for a one time usage, only then you might be pleased."
1.0,bad quality!
1.0,Too small for me. Doesn't stretch. I gave it to my niece
1.0,color is change<br />It rusted.
1.0,This shirt runs really small
1.0,Shoe runs small.
1.0,Beautiful watch. Wore it three times. The fourth time it couldn't keep the proper time--the second hand keeps getting stuck.
1.0,I love the fit and material for this dress but the buttons are sewn on so poorly that every single one is hanging off and looks like it's about to fall. I'm going to take it to the tailor to have the buttons tightened up but don't buy it if you don't want to be bothered with that or unless you can see buttons well and feel like doing a lot of them.
1.0,I bought these gloves twice. The first pair was a medium (my usual size) and they were tight. So I ordered a large and they were even smaller than the mediums and some of the fingers were so tight I could not get them on. I notice the seller dropped the price from $6.99 to $4.99. So they must be taking complaints. Save your money and buy a name brand.
1.0,Pretty much stopped working after 2 months. Not as bright as the first month. I use this to walk my dog and I can’t see anything. I charge this every 2-3days and all of sudden it decided not to be as bright.
1.0,Poor quality already paid $25 and sent back<br />Everything
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:13f97f4d4425a6a9437d6f215972a28]] Its a beautiful glove. I was excited to receive it. The “touch screen”  just doesn’t work.  I don’t know why people spend time selling false promises about things.  Just put the $ in to improve your product. Now, it costs the maker, it costs Amazon( which I am not worried about), and it costs me. The aggravation is so frustrating."
1.0,Do not buy this it won’t fit anyone but a child way too small
1.0,Horrible! Everyone of these lanyards broke. One got tangled in my daughters hair.
1.0,Every time you put a pair on they rip. Very poor quality
1.0,"My son really loves this. However, I cannot seem to get an odd &#34;bleach&#34; smell out of it. I wash it, but the smell is back by the next morning."
1.0,Stupid
1.0,"I went by the sizing chart and they were still too sma I like the quality but the sizing was too small ,I wear them under Clothing"
1.0,Ordered up one size for my wife based on other reviews and it was still too tight in the waist.
1.0,Too long. Could not zip up looked like a sack on me very hot and uncomfortable
1.0,I bought these for a halloween costume and the mold did not work and the top grill was way too big. It didn't look very good.
1.0,Not wool. I still wear it.
1.0,Very flimsy chiffon and nude color. Not as I expected. Never worn.
1.0,Way too big for a normal sized face. So disappointed. Would only fit a giant. I got the sugar skull cat with the red rose on top. This would only fit someone with a huge face. So  very  disappointed. I was really looking forward to wearing it.
1.0,Fits very small have them to my grand daughter she loved them
1.0,Just too small...doesn tlook great.  SOrry
1.0,Wore it once then threw it away. Cheap quality and not as funny as the picture when the product is 'grey' not black.
1.0,Fell apart after 2 weeks of wearing them
1.0,I don't understand how these are nose rings. Didn't fit or work in my nose.  I used them as earrings instead. They make pretty cool looking earrings at least.
1.0,I received 12 birthday hats and not 32 as advertised.
1.0,Broke a week after having it
1.0,The printed is not as show. This is not a jean or demin material. I returned it.
1.0,This was dollar store junk! Not even 1 star worthy. Save ur $$
1.0,Broke the first time i wore it :(
1.0,"I didn't love it,<br />Every time it curls around snaps so hard end up hurting my fingers. Very hard to use it. Wish I can send it back it was almos 6 dollars and 5 dollars and change shipping cost. Not worth it."
1.0,Very bad never buy again
1.0,"It is like a dry fast synthetic material, not cotton  wrong color. Looks cheap. You can see my black cotton mix shirt next to it in the photo."
1.0,I was sent two DIFFERENT sized socks. One was like thigh high pantyhose and the other was under the knee. By the time I tried them on it was outside the return or exchange window. They are very much a challenge to  put on. Even ordering the largest size and when following the instructions included.
1.0,"My niece abslutely loved them for Christmas, she put them on immediately! But within a few hours both slippers had already split at different seams!!!! We were able to sew them back together, but my niece went from extatic to sad in just a few hours."
1.0,They looked decent but when I tried to put one on the gain immediately fell off. Now way of putting it back on. Complete waste of time and money
1.0,"The feel and look of the pants were great, but they fit way too small."
1.0,This fits like a potato sack. There’s no definition of body curves it’s just a heavy mumu
1.0,This shirt came torn from the seam in the back.
1.0,Jacket runs small in arms and shoulders and looks cheap with logo being a sticker and not stitched.
1.0,Nice looking but the design is fatally flawed. Received it on 6/27. It's 8/4 and it's already broken and unusable.
1.0,really flimsy
1.0,"Way too small.  No way to return this, as it is international and would cost $80 to send back!!!!"
1.0,Got these for my girls crocs and the charms literally just fall off. Absolutely a waste of money
1.0,You get what you pay for. The waist came up to my underarms practically. I was going to return them but return shipping was more than the pants cost.
1.0,Looking nothing like description.
1.0,Did not like it and had to be returned strap broke!
1.0,I can't wear it. The top cuts too soon in the sides
1.0,Very bad cuality
1.0,looks nothing like in the picture.. total garbage
1.0,"It is a rain coat, but I was soaked to the bone. Also it doesn't quite look like the picture.  It is not lined as I had read it to be. The picture looks like it is thicker material. I had not used it until the return date was expired, so I guess I am stuck with a plain windbreaker."
1.0,The picture is of pants as well as the description yet I received shorts. Disappointed
1.0,Poor quality fabric an just didnt fit right at all
1.0,Screen print is nice but wow... cheap material. I don't think they could have found worse material...
1.0,"Most of these were definitely not real stone, returned immediately. Received many cheap plastic imitations. The lapis lazuli and tiger's eye were dead giveaways."
1.0,The shirt itself was very nice and ended up fitting my grand daughter!!
1.0,Item was not as pictured. Picture shows “Mini Mermaid” actual product says “daddy’s little mermaid”. Not what I wanted. Headband is very poorly made.
1.0,I only got one piece the picture said two piece it showed the red one in the black one I only got the red .. in the description says two piece I only got one
1.0,VERY disappointed elmno is NOT visible at all and mask is quite LARGE.
1.0,"After a few weeks, the bands keep popping off the watch. Can happen just when I’m moving my arm a bit. Very annoying, and I’m worried about losing my watch. In the garbage they go."
1.0,"La calidad del producto es muy mala, estan mintiendo, dicen que es 100% algodon y no es así, es un engaño."
1.0,Runs super small. A 3x was like a large
1.0,After waiting nearly 2 months for the scarf to arrive it had an ODOR!!
1.0,Product came bent. Want a full refund.
1.0,Very disappointed the lenses are not as dark or mirror as advertised
1.0,Worked well before it fell of my nose not even 24 hours after I received it. Wish I didn't waste my money on it
1.0,"Poor quality. As I was putting them on my hands for the first time the beads part was glued so bad , it came off completely. I tried to glue it back myself but did not work . Threw away the whole thing ,"
1.0,"If Amazon let me do '0' star I would have done that, It does not deserve any starts at all! The buttons are completely different than the picture. I never expected such a bad product. All the buyers please be aware before buying it."
1.0,I dont think the shoes  are genuine leather
1.0,"I’m 5’3” and usually wear a small. I ordered this in a medium. The fit was long and boxy on me, but not in a cute way... more like a “historical re-enactment” way. Also, the fabric is quite thin and sheer. Sending it back."
1.0,It looked beautiful on website. In person cheap quality
1.0,"It doesn't fit well around my head; the strap keeps sliding down. It came in pieces and was a pain to put together, the plastic pieces on the front kept sliding out of the holes when I needed to put the back piece on to keep it in place. The worst part is that the mask is EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. It is actually painful to wear this mask. The filter feels like it is cutting into my nose."
1.0,Just was not appealing
1.0,There is a nonsensical misspelling in the pants/hat pattern. I didn't notice when I bought it and now it's all I can see.
1.0,I am 6ft and I ordered a large shirt but it is too short. I have never had to buy from a big and tall category before. The shirt is also made like it should be a pull over with only 3 buttons instead of buttons all the way down. I do not like this shirt.
1.0,"I initially loved the item when I got it and ordered one for a friend as a gift. I am NOT PLEASED, I purchased this item the end of June and already it's beginning to tarnish..."
1.0,"very, very inexpensive polyester fabric. must be very easily damaged if they come out of the pouch damaged. also an irritation that i must print a label and drive to return something so flimsy. it doesn’t work out cost wise to buy this item."
1.0,"Did not work for me. Cheap stuff all around, not comfortable, no sense of style."
1.0,"I literally bought another one of these because he first one broke, and that time I felt it was because I pulled on it too hard. My second one arrived today I opened the package and pull that plastic off and go to tear the packaging holding the necklace and while I'm doing a chain just breaks and the necklace is broken...."
1.0,Ordered normal size. Way too small. Returned.
1.0,It's not my favorite shirt.
1.0,"It does not look like the picture or flare out.  The material is thin, I will not wear this"
1.0,Purchased these for my husband less than 2 months ago and they have already fallen apart. First a seam on the side came apart then one of the bottoms came unglued and fell off.
1.0,Extremely cheaply made
1.0,Made of a single layer of poor quality polyester.  Poor fit.  Threw it in the trash.
1.0,Fits small and not soft flannel
1.0,Glass cracked the first day i put it on.
1.0,"Unless your boobs are right under your neck or you have some magic bra to lift them there, I don't know how this could fit."
1.0,"Looks cheap, pockets uneven"
1.0,tiny... cant return cause you have to pay the return shipping back to china.... Wasted of $$$$
1.0,Not chiffon material like the picture and not very long to for a tall person who is 5’7. I immediately returned this item and got a full refund within 3-5 days
1.0,I ordered a 3xl and there is no way this is true to size.
1.0,sorry I had to return it too small. will be good for teenagers face.
1.0,"8/16/18 I ordered a gold band.  When I received it, it was indeed gold colored.  After 2 days of wearing the watch, the band turned mottled black and was ugly.  You get what you pay for.<br />11/19/18 This week I've had trouble with the watch stopping.  The switch at the end of travel of the stem is hit or miss.  Power is not reliably supplied to the watch and it stops running.  This has been a big waste of money.  I need to find a reliable watch to use with the very nice gold color band I bought to replace the mess supplied with the watch."
1.0,NO CARE INSTRUCTIONS. NO FABRIC CONTENT LABEL. Added bonus: XL is about a men's size 8. This is XL only if you had your feet bound as a child!
1.0,"So cheap, don’t bother"
1.0,"Not only was this too small, but it was nothing like the pictures. The fabric is a clingy cotton material that attracts every piece of hair and dandruff it can find. The neck was not off the shoulder, more like a scoop neck. Overall, this was a waste of my money."
1.0,I Specifically ordered these lanyards because they were the colors that my daughter would like. I get something pink with animal print which was NOT in the picture.
1.0,they are cheap and looks nothing like the picture
1.0,Es de muy poca calidad
1.0,Product is probably 3 sizes off.. Way to small
1.0,"The came with one pocket sewn shut and one hem un-sewn. When I started to fill out the return  form and saw that I needed a printer, I figured I'd take care of it myself. Unfortunately I ended up ripping the pants when trying to unsew the the pocket. So, stupid me is now stuck with ripped faulty bad quality pants.Thank god they didn't cost much. But I would not order them again."
1.0,Way too small and not enough stretch
1.0,Item came missing a whole section with no option to return
1.0,"DO NOT BUY HERE!  First, pants are NOT Linen.  5% poly, 95% cotton.  I usually wear an 10-12.  Second, I ordered a Large and an Extra-Large thinking I'd return the one that didn't fit.  Received and the material is NOT LINEN and even the Extra Large is snug.  Started process to return both and the postage is more than purchase!  AND it says restocking fees on returns.  I always check if returns allowed, but didn't read this fine print.  I will certainly verify free returns on ANY future purchases.  What a ripoff.  Learned a new life lesson and Adding directly to my donation bag."
1.0,These are crap. I think they lasted like two weeks.
1.0,Rip Offs and Scammers!  Beware!
1.0,If you are flat chested then buy! Other wise buyer be ware
1.0,No zipper only buttons in the crotch also sizing is way off. And then to return it you get stuck with paying to return. Definitely would not purchase again don't waste your time and money
1.0,Fit much smaller than any other XXL I have ever ordered
1.0,Too clunky. I liked how it looks different. But it’s too big for 120 lbs.
1.0,I bought this for a Halloween costume thinking ntheyd look much nicer than a clip on. They looked great but did not last. The first time trying them on the magnet came undone from one of the earrings. Not only that they were not strong enough to even stay on my ears.
1.0,"I’m so angry at myself for not looking at the necklaces sooner because I thought they were fine. However, the day before graduation when I looked at them to wrap them for my students, I noticed that one has a typo!!! Now it’s too late to exchange it and I will scramble between school today and graduation tonight to figure something else out. Other than that, they are beautiful."
1.0,"I guess I thought they'd be round....weird huh?!<br />I'm not sure why they came vacume packed, but they did. And they don't puff up. Who's the clown now....I guess me!"
1.0,The littered earing was broke in the package when it arrived. The tear drop earings were bent and the top of one did not have the holes punched even so it folded over too much and the leather holes were really stretched out. They were made with really cheap materials. The three tier earings looked nice but the earing hooks were so flimsy that when you put the rubber back on they would bend and move. Very disappointed was going to give as gifts but I would not give these to anyone!
1.0,The size is for a kid and its like 12 inches deep. The colors are no where near multicam and it is shiny. Paper thin. Waste of money.
1.0,Terrible product!!!! Wore socks once and holes in them already!!  I wish I could give them zero stars.  Holes....really.....wore once?!!!!!  Lame!
1.0,"This watch was really unique, loved the look, unfortunately the battery did not work therefore neither did the watch. Very disappointed. Sent watch back."
1.0,The watch is too small
1.0,It looked nice but then one of the fingers broke. It broke within 5 minutes
1.0,"I have worn these shoes maybe 6 times, and the stitching is ripping apart. I noticed it at the hospital after surgery yesterday 6/9/2023. The day I noticed it was the last day they were eligible for a return or replacement which I was not aware of. This morning when I attempted to start the return process I was informed yesterday was the deadline to return them. Now I'm stuck with them. My warning is never buy this brand of shoes. They are not worth the price, and the quality is garbage."
1.0,Too thin to wear. Waste of money
1.0,Very very very short. I put these on my small-for-her-age baby and the suit barely came to her waist- let alone cover her top! It fit light a high waisted swimsuit bottom for a baby.
1.0,"Very disappointed. The watch was delivered in a box but the watch it's self was very dusty. The watch band is very small, strange since the watch is billed as large."
1.0,"The product description says that the glasses are pink lenses with a gold frame, but the lenses are yellow.  Disappointed."
1.0,"Cheap, small and see-through. Do not buy. I bought xl for my brother who usually wears large and he received a size small with an xl label."
1.0,"DISAPPOINTED IN MATERIAL AND FIT, PAID TOO MUCH TO SHIP AN NOW JUST AS MUCH TO RETURN, ILL THROW IN GARBAGE"
1.0,"I bought these reasonably-priced, waterproof gloves for my 8-year-old daughter.  They worked very well for her until the lining turned inside out.  We've tried everything, and can not get the lining back into the fingers of the gloves.  My daughter has only been wearing them for about a week, and can't wear them anymore.  Waste of money...."
1.0,"poor quality, threw it in the garbage!"
1.0,Well I wish I could tell you how I liked it but I never got the item so never mind
1.0,Too large and the colors were muddy.
1.0,… and very much see-through!
1.0,Was adorable but so small I could tell when I opened it that it wasn't going to fit. I ordered an XXL. Sent it back.
1.0,"I received these slippers on July 20th. By August 30th one of the soles was almost completely hanging off and the stitching attached to it was practically non-existent. I know what you're thinking, did I run a marathon in them? Nope. Did I climb Mount Everest in them? Nope. Was I swimming in the ocean with them and was it bitten by a shark? Nope. Was I walking around the house with them on a few hours a day? Yes. Flimsy and unreliable. There are far better slippers out there to buy, probably cheaper too. For $24.99 I would expect them to last longer than 1 month and 10 days."
1.0,Should have sold for $10. Poor quality. Cheap materials.
1.0,Material is so cheap and so thin that when attempting to try for the first time it ripped apart in half.
1.0,"first pair lasted a day FOR  touchscreen capabilities(XMAS GIFT). Stopped working so I  informed the seller. They sent me a second pair nice gesture. Strange seller did not request 1 pair to be returned now i see why.Unfortunately  the gloves still didn't work for a touchscreen glove 2nd set. My husbands $10.00 work gloves that have lots of wear and tear and not designed to be touchscreen gloves worked much better on our smartphone and touchscreen gadgets. That is pretty sad. Stay clear ladies and men researching these gloves. They are warm but defective and misleading. I tried them on two iPad,Samsung 5,note 4, ,3  5, Nexus 7 and  a touchscreen Lenovo  laptop."
1.0,The product is much to small for calves even though I got extra large. I am 5.9 and 180 lbs . They fit my 50lb granddaughter
1.0,There are no glitters : ordinary cheap fabric : such a deceit
1.0,"The strap was broken but I tried it on anyways. This dress looks like a garbage bag. Seems very cheaply made :(<br />I'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs. A medium was baggy and awkwardly long"
1.0,I will not be wearing this. It is way too small and ordered an XL. Looks like it could fit a child!!
1.0,"The umbrella, on the first windy day, flipped up in the shape of a U.  Very disappointed and would not recommend you purchase this if you are looking for a windproof umbrella."
1.0,"I loved these for the first few runs. Sadly, they died rather quickly and left me with no music..... the horror!!!"
1.0,This is the worst thing I have ever purchased. I washed it before wearing and it shrunk so much that I couldn't even get it on my body
1.0,Cheap price=cheap dress. This is almost like a Halloween costume material and the sleeves are itchy. I am returning it!
1.0,"Rip off. One ply, raw edges, one seam. LOL. Don’t waste your money!!!!"
1.0,I bought several of these shifts. I found that one of them had different sizing but all were to small.
1.0,"Returned it bc it showed too much butt cheeks and though good quality material, it’s too warm to wear in the heat."
1.0,"Didn’t even try this own because the material was completely not what I expected. It’s definitely synthetic, if I had to describe it, something like umbrella material? The title of the item says cotton, so this is misleading to say the least. Definitely returning this."
1.0,"The size of the shoe it perfect but they slip off every 5 seconds, wouldn’t buy them again. Didn’t even last 5 minutes on."
1.0,"This was WAY too small. And the material felt very cheap. It was poorly made, with threads already loose when I got it."
1.0,The heel is completely different<br />The shoe looks super cheap in person! Runs way way to small.
1.0,This is an item that shatters the rule of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; Cheap plastic toy glasses for $30. No thanks. Optics were terrible. Set a new record for returning time.
1.0,Very disappointed this item did not come as indicated as embroidery it was just plain material!!!!
1.0,"Poor quality, not as described"
1.0,These bows break within one use!
1.0,"Maybe I should have read the description in more detail.  Buried at the bottom is a fabric description.  It is NOT silk as the title suggests, but a cheap rayon/spandex blend.  Still, it’s a pretty fabric for the price.  However, I am both tall and busty and it’s just not long enough.  It barely comes to my belly button.  These might work for someone with a shorter torso or smaller chest, but I’m sending them back.  Mostly I’m turned off by the misleading title, which is too bad.  I would have bought them without “silk” in the title and been less disappointed."
1.0,"I thought these were 3D, but they’re flat snd not as cute as the picture. I returned them."
1.0,I doubt the fiber contents are as described. This hat is super itchy and leaves a rash where it contacts my skin.  It is attractive but unwearable.
1.0,"Returned, didnt fit, scratchy, and itchy."
1.0,"It does not catch hair.  Its more like a huge frisbee than a catch basin for hair.  The hair just stays off your shoulders, but hits the floor anyway."
1.0,Returned it and went back to the stock band after trying it for about a half hour.  The metal is cheap feeling and it kinda clatters as you move around.
1.0,An extra large is about an actual men's medium.  Sleeves are very short.
1.0,"I sized up to a xl and it came looking like it was an  Xs. I would post a pic of myself in it but I looked like a rolled sausage. I am a size 12, 180lbs. Not worth the money. The fabric was nice though."
1.0,The received watch either has a dead batter or one was not installed at the factory.
1.0,It is such a cute outfit.  However it did not come with buttons to close.  Instead of returning I sewed it.  Could only use once for her photos.
1.0,Threw in garb as garbage. Ordered black and it had red stitches all over it where it was sown. Cheaply made and looked horrible
1.0,Don't waste your money on this one.  They don't stay in place and didn't work for my sizing needs.  A safer bet would be to have sizing beads placed in your ring if you can't have it resized for whatever reason (antique ring or metal that can't be resized).
1.0,Does not fit!!!!
1.0,To thin and no compression
1.0,It broke in a day . I am going to return it.
1.0,Really blurry. Driving seemed unsafe with these things on.
1.0,The decorations on the long earrings are on backwards.  I contacted the seller and have received no response.
1.0,It broke while I was trying to get it on the watch. The magnet doesn't seem very strong or secure. I wouldn't purchase this type of band again.
1.0,"Odd fit, odd design and not that comfortable!! Not at all what I thought it would look like or feel like. It's warm but the line across the chest is restricting."
1.0,"Sleeves are too short for a long sleeve top. They cut off above the wrist and make the shirt appear too small. I should have returned but didn't.<br /><br />I genuinely like the top, just didn't fit the way I hoped."
1.0,We were disappointed with the appearance of the masks. We intentionally shopped for something with that was solid colored (no white outline) with purple strings that matched. These were purchased to give away to HS students. We did not get the masks advertised for the product. We could have bought masks elsewhere. Sell what you present in the picture or change the picture.
1.0,So cute and wanted to love them but the sole is suuuper uncomfortable and they broke after one wear
1.0,It's too difficult to braid hair with this device. Save your money and choose anything else. I'll buy something else
1.0,This coat was really cute when it arrived. But before my daughter could wear it the zipper tags fail off and after two days the zipper needs to be replaced. So upsat because I wanted to order another one for my youngest daughter.
1.0,This should have been the second of the same hat. First 1 has a stutched logo. Advertised as a stitched logo. Got an iron on logo that will come off easily. I know for a fact this a switch since I purchased this as a buy again from my list. As far as im concerned amazon should refund me for the garbage I was sent
1.0,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of the earrings. I conducted research and scanned the reviews before the purchase. There did not seem to be any poor reviews. Bottom line is that this product is very, very poor quality. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"
1.0,"It would’ve been so cute-had it been made with any kind of quality control in place. The sweater itself is soft, and it’s beyond adorable. However, it is made so cheaply, it’s clear this thing is going to fall apart in one wear-it basically came to me brand new falling apart. I’m sad because I wanted to keep it, but for almost $40 there’s no way."
1.0,"I did not like this dress. In fact, after getting it and trying it on, I returned it. It is made out of material that is so like grandma’s old nylon nightgown. It is pretty in the picture, but not so much in person. The color wasn’t really red but more like orange-ish red. It was not flattering at all. My only thought was how fast can I send this back..."
1.0,Broke after wearing it for a week
1.0,"It’s damn tight , would work for girls better !!"
1.0,Hubby couldn't put them on as the ankle width was way too small. We returned them.
1.0,Wanted to  love  it..
1.0,"Garbage, terrible material. Unwearable"
1.0,No pude utilizar es demasiado pequeño no se espanten en los estrenos para ajustar la distancia por eso lo devolví y no e recibido aún mi devolución
1.0,"These shoes were a complete joke. They have a flipping USB charging port near the top of where my little girl's foot would be. Are you kidding me, what kind of preschooler would be comfortable with something like that in their shoe? And if they remove the soul, which just lift right up, they have access to the light source incomplete right out. Absolutely the most ridiculous design I've ever seen."
1.0,These are not stainless steel
1.0,Didn't fit as expected so gave to brother for lounge wear.
1.0,Men’s large looked to be a youth large
1.0,It looks like nylon thrown together it doesn’t stay up has no grip on edges to stay in place
1.0,The sizing is seriously wrong. Way to small.
1.0,"I have other ""quick dry"" articles of clothing and none of them felt like this.  Stiff and made noise when you put it on.  Weird.  Returned."
1.0,Way too small and not great quality. It’s just spandex. Definitely returning it.
1.0,The dress looked very cheap. The hem was uneven. I will be returning it. I would be embarrassed to wear it. It did arrive on a timely manner.
1.0,"Bag arrived defective, handle is incomplete, only left side of handle can be attached"
1.0,Watch would not keep time.
1.0,Very disappointed with order/outfit! Ordered a 3T and shipped to a friend for a present and they received a 6-9month size. They don't have the means to ship back and now they're stuck with a really small size. ANNOYED
1.0,There was no turtleneck!  I will be returning.
1.0,Cindy lou cut off at bottom. Not readable
1.0,Terrible quality. I don't think it could actually fit a normal persons face. Don't waste your time.
1.0,"Bot one  clasp broke , bought another the clasp broke again....not happy"
1.0,"Not a good product, very hazy"
1.0,It says for septum but it’s too small for my nose and too big for my ears
1.0,Very low quality made in China material doesn’t look anything like the picture
1.0,"I had high hopes for these pants and was very disappointed when I tried them on.  The design makes for an odd and uncomfortable fit through the crotch and the material is so thin, they are see through.  While I desired spandex/polyester like usual yoga pants, I wanted white and was aware these had cotton material, but I wasn't prepared for them to be so opaque.  These quickly made it to the pajama drawer of my dresser and I won't be purchasing more."
1.0,"Chest was too large, waist too small, and sleeves were just off."
1.0,These glasses are to small for middle age kids<br />My kids are 6and 11 both struggle to put them on
1.0,Not what was expected...not worth 10 bucks more like $2
1.0,"I've only had the watch for a few months and it stopped telling time, I've had watches bought from supermarkets that lasted longer if this was a fashionable for jewelry only it should be mentioned."
1.0,this earring is to small its the size of a piece of sugar dont buy this. If you want real gauges get a 16g or bigger
1.0,Do not buy this. It will break in no time flat.<br />The earring back fell off almost immediately and had to repair it and more and more stuffjust
1.0,"This was one of the worst buys I’ve ever gotten on amazon. Probably the worst. Not only did take almost 2 months to get, the earrings are so small, SO SMALL. As you can see in the picture I posted. And they didn’t come with any back. I guess I got what I paid for, but I could have gone to Claire’s and gotten something better for the same price with a backing.  I’m not happy at all. This seller shouldn’t be on amazon."
1.0,"Super narrow, my husband couldn't fit his foot in and he always wears the size we ordered. These will be returned."
1.0,My daughter wore a hole in the right shoe after only 4 DAYS of dance class! That’s ridiculous!!
1.0,"Plastic, broke."
1.0,This mask had the strongest chemical/rubber/plastic smell.  Could hardly wear it.  Other than the smell the mask looks great!
1.0,Glasses broke the same day I got them!!!! Very cheap!!!
1.0,Way too small legs were too small not extra large sizing and expensive
1.0,Not linen as advertised and do not appreciate the deception in this regard. Great blouse all the same.
1.0,"found the purse to be ok I PUT TOO MUCH IN IT AND THE STRAPS RIPPED,  I  gave the other two away"
1.0,After washing this happens… the quality of fabric is so cheap that after one wash it resulted with so much fluff… not worth it…
1.0,Broke within two weeks made poorly made.
1.0,It's not for me!
1.0,Kind of cheap quality & the sizing definitely runs small. Several of the seams were frayed & not very symmetrical. Returning
1.0,The shirts are too itchy...i don’t know what it is but they are uncomfortable:( not going to use them.
1.0,"I got this ear cuff going based on the picture and other's reviews. I was really excited to get it, however when I got it it was NOTHING like they show or say. The metal was cheap, the leaves didn't look like leaves and it didn't even stick to my ear. I was very disappointed. I never wrote a review because the price was cheap and I didn't care at the moment, but I realized that I can help some of you by not recommending this ear cuff."
1.0,The band is way too big! The elastic was bad and does not even stretch. After only one day of wear the pattern is starting to fade off of the fabric. Definitely not worth it. Pay the extra for a better band that you can actually use.
1.0,"This necklace broke before I could even try it on. No force, chain just separated. Bummed"
1.0,Not what I expected at all! I thought it would be more of a cotton fabric but it’s more of a scuba fabric?.. very disappointed
1.0,Way too small and short. Poor quality. I returned it.
1.0,I ordered the apricot colored band and the color is way off. It's got this cheap look. Returning it.
1.0,Broke the day I wore it. Guess that's what happens when you pick the cheapest option. Buy at your own risk.
1.0,"Arrived with a dead battery. Replaced the battery, doesn't keep time. Gained 2 hrs 53 min over a 24 hour time span.<br />Again.... THREE HOURS FAST!<br />POS, worthless piece of junk."
1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE PANTS! I have worn them 3 times and they already have a hole in the waistband. For spending over $100 that is unacceptable! Terrible quality. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,Don't recommend.
1.0,"I don't like to write bad reviews.  I usually like to give high marks, but in this case I did not receive what was promised.  The glasses were just regular readers.  The box said computer readers but no ombre just clear.  Sorry but very disappointing as they will just sit in my drawer.  They were also suppose to be 1.25 power and they were the wrong power."
1.0,Very cheap. Seams frayed and pulled open right away. Ended up tossing them and replacing them with a $5 pair from WalMart that is holding up very well. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Super cute sunglasses but they are extremely cheap and easy to break!!
1.0,Looks cheap and made cheap not at all like pucture
1.0,"Updated: this watch doesn't work. Even after replacing the new battery, it starts and stops and doesn't keep time. I am returning it. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Pretty, petite, quality appearance, comfortable. It's hard to find a watch with a small case these days but this one is small enough but still looks really nice. I bought it for my mom and she loves it."
1.0,This had arrived in horrible shape. It is flat and does NOT hold a shape even close to the posted picture DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,The package did not include all of the parts. The front of the phone sticker was not included in my package.
1.0,Horrible sizing. It was a waste of money. So upset.
1.0,Didn’t like them at all! Obviously cheap sunglasses
1.0,"It felt cheaply made. The stitching seemed  fragile  like it would just rip out. And the gray was more of a light purple color. Not impressed, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,Item is not as shown in pictures.
1.0,"Thin quality, worst of the worst, even Walmart sweat pants are made more durable an comfortable."
1.0,This was suppose to be a large but my 10 year granddaughter could hardly get on!
1.0,"Walmart sells these for a fraction of the price!!! They're great flip flops with the nylon thing that goes between toes, so comfy for toddler, but don't waste your money buying them from amazon!"
1.0,Did not fit on my head at all and I had taken measurements!
1.0,Decent enough pattern and material but the waistband wasn’t sewn in great so it wasn’t worth keeping or replacing.
1.0,The mountains look like blobs and are not detailed as the description picture shows.  The spinning ring is misaligned and catches on stuff.
1.0,Sent it back. Flimsy product
1.0,"Very poor quality.  The jumper did not fit well.  And the worse part of this is that I had to pay to return it.<br />Be ware, do not order from this company unless you have a great view of the material it is made of.<br />Disappointed."
1.0,Not a real size 14 and the material is thick and very stiff. Will  be sending it back.
1.0,"**update below as of 9/6/19.<br /><br />The helmet came in a bubble mailer, crushing and distorting the head band. The headband is made of a harder, flexible plastic that once creased almost refuses to take a different shape. For the photo above, I forced the band over a foam head and attached the horns. As you can see, the horn unit was cast terribly. The horns are wonky and go in opposite directions. They also do not sit flush in the housing. You'll need to permanently adhere the to keep them from falling out.<br /><br />I have requested a new item replacement on the off chance that this was just a bad reproduction. I am happy to change the rating if the new item is in a better state.<br /><br />** The replacement was just as bad. It's a terrible design with a warped mold. Do not waste your money."
1.0,Toooo Big
1.0,Was so excited to finally find a hot pink band. But the band will not stay on it pulls right out of the watch each time I put it on.
1.0,came broken...pretty cheap.
1.0,"I bought these shorts for my wife who rides her mountain bike to school. The trip is 30 minutes each day. After ONE day, the area where the shorts rub the seat is rubbed through and ripping. And even before she put them on, we could see they were made very cheaply - the padding was put in misaligned and the shorts weren't very comfortable -- but note that this problem with the padding is completely separate from the material ripping.  One star, wasted money - too bad. I wish I could exchange them."
1.0,The connection for the keychain portion isn't very sturdy....a 2 year old was able to break it. It's a shame as I really loved this tail keychain!
1.0,Very puffy and stiff<br />Still waiting for refund
1.0,The wrong size was delivered and due to my schedule I didn’t have time to go through the hassle of returning it.
1.0,"Nylon thread makes this cute lightweight shirt a nightmare. The thin fishing line type thread breaks easily, leaving the tiny stiff ends that make my skin itch. The photos also show how much lint the fabric picks up!"
1.0,shirt is nice but run small
1.0,It was a different material than in description and therefore had a completely different look.  Returned.
1.0,Plain ones are good  the print ones are somewhat smaller and my nails catch on the loose fabric on the inside. Fabric twisted around one of my toes and I didn't know it until I removed my shoe. Ouch😟
1.0,dark colored cheap steel.
1.0,Way too wide. Fits like a short Moo Moo. Just no.
1.0,"Cheapest “cardigan” I have ever seen. The print is terrible,  it is thin and cheaply made. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY."
1.0,"Not comfortable and extremely small, either has to sit at the tip of my nose to allow my mouth to move freely or rests right below my bottom lip making it difficult to speak clearly which is no better than wearing the mask alone."
1.0,Nothing at all like I thought it would be.  Seems like its more for wearing around your neck or something.
1.0,I really wish a stone wouldn't had fallen out . don't buy !!!!!!!!!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8ff9fdd2c5eca0fb983327acc215483e]] This is a disappointment at best. The shirt colors are dull and not bright like shown. The sleeves do not match the pattern of the shirt because they are plain with no pattern as shown. The interior of the hood and shirt are white not the same color as the shirt as shown. The size runs small as well. It took a little time to arrive but not to bad. The material itself is not to bad. Wish it was as shown.
1.0,very good production
1.0,"After literally ONE day of wearing this belt, the grommets started falling apart. My fiancé is very handy and tried fixing it and putting it back together, just for it to start falling apart in a different area. We were both so disappointed because he said the belt itself was really quite comfy."
1.0,They don't fit Polynesian legs
1.0,Don't buy. Not worth it
1.0,One stone was missing
1.0,TOO NARROW to be effective. In the illustrations on Amazon it seemed to be a full face mask to cover from the nose area to just under the chin. In REALITY if you use it over your nose the bottom of the mask ends up in between your lips. I even doubt that these would be wide enough to cover a child's face. I am very disappointed & going to see if Amazon will issue me a refund so I can mail them back. Do not throw your money away buying these masks!
1.0,"This is a gorgeous dress, but the sizing is way off. I would say their US size estimate is about 4 sizes off."
1.0,"Super cute but broke the first time I put it on, I didnt even get to wear it."
1.0,I’m so disappointed! When I opened the package up it was not the dress I ordered. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Will be returning immediately. Dress did not have the same neckline and had ruffles??? So much for wearing this to a wedding on Saturday. ORDER A DIFFERENT DRESS. TOTAL RIP OFF AND WASTE OF MY TIME
1.0,Cheap and that's what quality you get.
1.0,Photo is deceiving. Pendent is very small and chain very thin. I wouldn’t have bought this item had the scale of it been better represented. Live and learn.
1.0,"I was disappointed the charge was used up so fast. No usable for me with this issue.  Also, fits a dog about 40-45lbs."
1.0,The pj's are too big. The size was not made clear before purchase.
1.0,"The product was falsely advertised it’s not silk, and the elastic on the falls apart after 1 month, not worth the money"
1.0,Absolute junk. Dropped these glasses about 4 feet and the ear piece came flying off. Save your money buy some oakleys
1.0,"When I put this dress on to wear for only the 3rd time, the elastic around the top completely snapped, turning the dress into drapes."
1.0,I wore these three times and then they broke!
1.0,"Is this vendor a thief? I gotta ask, because not only this item barely looks like the picture IRL, it also broke the first day I wore it 🤷‍♀️<br />If you’re looking for a unique chunky ethnic necklace that will last, DO NOT waste your time and money here!  The picture is misguiding at best… This literally might win 1st prize in the cheapest and flimsiest necklace I ever bought category!"
1.0,"This stopped working within 2 days of owning.  Not a battery issue.<br /><br />Additionally,  the four on the clock face is not correct.  It shows it as llll not lV."
1.0,This is a poor fit and and very cheaply made.
1.0,I don't know who this was made for but if you're over 5' tall then it might be too short. Mine didn't even hit my waist. Sadly returning.
1.0,"[[ASIN:B01F1TXB3C Copi Women's Simple Design Fashion Backpacks College bags Wine]]<br />I really like it, but the product I received was poorly made. I will be returning the product. I expected better due to price."
1.0,"The breast cups are awful. Makes the dress unwearable if you are anything below a D cup. Too bad, I was really hoping it would work for me"
1.0,Cheapest quality I've ever seen. How dose amazon even allow this to be sold on the site. This should be sold on a 99 cent store.
1.0,I actually need to return these as they are way too small and I ordered a 2x based on other reviews.
1.0,Nice but mine came apart at the clasp part had to put it back together myself
1.0,"The wand was broken and the butterfly smashed when we opened the package. The jewelry broke before we even put them on, the skirt smells like rotten fish. Definitely don't recommend."
1.0,"This hoodie is not soft, It is made of what feels like swim suit material and it's itchy.  I bought three of them and the one with a kitten on it was thicker and soft. But the other two yuck,"
1.0,The adage that you get what you pay for is true with these cases. Loose and misaligned hinges combined with fairly weak case walls mean you can easily press one half of the case into the other half--bad luck if your glasses are in there. Try a different option.
1.0,"Poorly made.  The foam lining is very thin.  My wife said they were fogging up off and on.  So, I let her use mine.  I agreed.  They were annoying.  The fogging was off and on.  Not a well made product."
1.0,Bought the hat for a vacation in Greece. After the first day of wearing the hat the top started to separate itself from the rest of the hat. On day 3 when the entire top was hanging by a string I cut the section off  to be able to wear it for sun protection. This hat was not expensive but I expected it to last at least the week of my vacation.
1.0,"These don't stay on without some velcro or something. I bought these because I work 15 hour days and by the end of it my bra is digging into my shoulders. Why would I want to have to add some scratchy velcro to an already sensitive area (my shoulders). Anyway, I lost one on day #1 of wearing these. I'll have to find another brand."
1.0,Don’t came with the liner.
1.0,WAY TO SMALL Cheesey  :(
1.0,"bought for my 12 year old, sizing is WAY off... maybe would fit a very lean, tall 3 year old. Don't waste your money or time."
1.0,"No me agrado, la tela y el color es totalmente diferente. Nada que ver con la foto!!"
1.0,The blue part of the earring was practically clear. Really no blue color could be seen. On the website the blue part looked opague.
1.0,Product runs very small. Material is paper thin. The bottoms of the pants weren't even hemmed and finished.
1.0,"I ordered these slippers for my son. He liked them a lot for because of were very comfortable and warm, but, unfortunately, they didn't last long. They lasted for about five months and then the sole of one slipper came completely off."
1.0,They were to big for my ears
1.0,"The heart shape cut of the fabric is not as pictured. The top of the heart goes straight across and when wearing the pants it does not resemble a heart, and just looks like an awkward grey patch on your behind."
1.0,Tiny and dirty.
1.0,I love the dress but I never received it.
1.0,Watch does not keep accurate time. Falls behind atfter running some hours.  You are better off buying a watch wth a battery or solar. Would not recommend.
1.0,"The positive reviews are misleading. There are many reviews claiming quality control issues. On the ones I received It looks like the clear cover was either heat damaged and or not quality checked for fit. The clear area is all wavy, buckled, and stippled. Both that I ordered had this problem. Will return."
1.0,"Epic catastrophic failire of the blu tooth pairing on the very first night nearly caused me to be late to work. I set the device to go off in conjunction with my alarm clocks to ensure I woke up after after a single snooze. The blu tooth pairing, even though tested swveral times before bed, failed and the device never worked in the the morning. Upon arriving to work ever so bsrely on time I attempted to figure out what happened via the app only to discover it had unpaired and would not pair again. I am returning for full money back."
1.0,I went to pull them up and the seam ripped...I ordered  Super dissatisfied. I am 5'9'' and 180lbs and the large wouldn't even go past my knees...I wear a medium/large in all other leggings.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:487dfafb4609bfe31065c04eb429b3c7]] Finally took the dress out of the package to have tiny red spots on my dress. The dress actually fits great but was unable to wear out due to blemishes in the fabric. I have no idea what it is and it's up along the middle part of of dress. What a shame and waste of money. I'm sure this dress would have looked HOT on me too.
1.0,As soon as I place on the back came off. Pretty but a disaster.
1.0,The clasp was broken!
1.0,The dress is not made correctly. The slip sewn into it is too big for the actual dress and it's not attached to the dress in the important areas. I'm a small B cup and this dress makes me look like a DDD and not in a good way
1.0,ordered XL. It would not fit a 10 year old in my opinion
1.0,I ordered the medium the first time and they were too large. I reordered the small and they are too small. I don't think the pants are made according to the proper waist size. I am returning the small as well and will not reorder.
1.0,Seem split open on first use. Save your money. Dreadful bag.
1.0,"Stickiness is there....coverage is not! You cannot wear these if you have large or heavy/dense breasts. It's pretty basic gravity issue. With no other means of support, no matter how ""sticky"" the tape or silicone is, these things will not hold you in place, let alone PUSH UP anything!"
1.0,The sizes from china are so off. No thanks.
1.0,"I wanted to try them as soon as they came. The cup was small and I ordered the largest this retailer had. I'm thinking there are bigger rabbit ear bras out there. Anyway, cups felt fine, although small. The rabbit ear part is not sticky enough and keeps peeling back. When you do get them to stick, they slide down, without you hardly noticing that. Then you have no lift. Made my boobs look square. They are pretty much just nipple covers. Sorry! Wish I could have given a better review."
1.0,"This is my first 1 Star Review ever. The dress was looser than expected, but workable. I ordered a small and my measurements are 38-26-37. The bust fit with the rest fitting loosely but not horribly so. I always wash before wear and this garment, I decided to hand wash. The red and the black immediately started bleeding so I pulled it out of the water but the white was pink already and there were even a few black streaks on the white as well. Less than 2 hours of ownership and it’s garbage. Expected way more from this dress. Will never purchase this brand again. Waste of money and not worth the risk. I would give zero stars if an option."
1.0,They are nice bandanas...if you get them all. I ordered 6 and received 2. The invoice even said 6 pack.  Will change review once this order is complete.
1.0,"However it came with one strap broken, off of where it was sown into the back. It didn't go over my ladies and it was SO TIGHT. LOL but if you get bigger in size it would be perfect. I wasn't able to send it back to get refunded though. Otherwise I'd post a better review"
1.0,Low quality and fades
1.0,Did not work for my  smart phone. I complained and they returned my money but have not told me where to return it.
1.0,Purchase this item for my wife in her size and it’s too loose
1.0,Went to wrap as Xmas gift to see that the letters are peeling off of the jersey. Hoping they exchange it after Xmas. It is too late to get a replacement before the 25th
1.0,"I really like the look and design but the quality is not the best. My this is my second one because my first one was ripping (I thought it was just a bad patch). I got a second one and just within 3 months, the edges stated to come apart and the seam of the card holder is coming apart. Bad quality product."
1.0,No no es buena
1.0,They fell apart while putting them on
1.0,"Only one costume arrived, not adult and kids as advertised."
1.0,"I did like the look and feel of these glasses and the 400 uv rating but after wearing them for 2 hours every other day for 2 months (during my bicycle ride), the frame broke at the bottom of the left lens. There was no stress on it, it just snapped. And the return period which must only be about a month was over. I would not recommend these glasses."
1.0,"I've had these for approximately 2 months now and wear them no less than 40 hours a week. They are randomly slipping and not doing their job. I do not have them super tight. They are just tight enough to keep the shirt tucked in, but not so tight that I can't sit or bend without issue. There is no reason for them to slip off the shirt. Would not buy again."
1.0,"This product was poorly made and it looks used, I paid $63 on what I could have made this shirt 👚 myself, it’s not at all what I expected"
1.0,Wrong item. Not worth my time to send back. What I did get was very cheap looking not a steampunk moon and compass but a half moon with cheap picture of books stuck to a small metal circle. UG!
1.0,"Suppose to be a XL but,<br />Fits more like a  USA medium"
1.0,Did not like the quality or the material it look really cheap!!
1.0,"This was purchased off my wishlist.  It is so thin that it is practically transparent.  The material is cheap & if you have anything larger than a C cup, purchase a larger size...money wasted..."
1.0,"I wore this watch for two days and the strap broke.  I'm not hard on watches either, have had some straps last as much as a decade.  If you want a watch you can use more than 48 htd, don't bother with this one."
1.0,"Disappointed. Received my item today hoping my 2yr will be able to wear it this weekend but way too big, could fit a 3yr old, and the imitation denim is a dark wash, not light as shown in the image. Submitted return request immediately!"
1.0,"Absolutely beautiful and fits perfect, but ripped just like in another review. So disappointed!"
1.0,Is not a pant is like a short.
1.0,"I no longer have the sweater and I did not take a picture but the picture would not show it's poor quality material. The sweater was baggy in the arms and felt as if it were made of actual plastic. The design was also ugly because it did not take up the whole sweater. I was going to give it to my grandfather for Christmas, but I ended up find a better version at half the price at Walmart."
1.0,"These would fit a narrow ski better than a human foot. Talk about cheese graters on the toes. Tried to cover with multiple bandaids, tape, ANYTHING and they were miserable and the clips are something I’ve never seen. We all wore these as bridesmaid shoes and no one could keep them on because of the clips, let alone the fact that they literally ate our feet raw."
1.0,"After wearing these gloves for the first time, there were three ripped seams in the fingers.  This is a very cheaply made product - don't waste your money."
1.0,It does not slim anything. Trying to get it on was nearly impossible it was so small. I ordered a large and it looked like it was made for an 8 year old girl. The tags ripped off in the process so I can't return it. It rolls down at the top with every move. I doesn't hold anything in.
1.0,Material was very odd and uncomfortable-colors different than how it appeared in the picture. Returned
1.0,This item looked like a table cloth....Terrible product...
1.0,Fit was way too small. This is a child sized gag gift.
1.0,The bracelet was huge and didn’t fit an average sized wrist. The leather felt very plasticy and I’m returning it
1.0,"The ""leather"" is thin and doesn't look like it will last long. It didn't conform to my foot, and there was no way to adjust it. I'm sending them back and keeping a similar sandal sold here on Amazon by Viakix."
1.0,they are completely see through these and the fabric is very bad
1.0,The neck is choking but nicely fitting on the body besides this.
1.0,Completely garbage shredded in the washer. The head band is just a cut off shirt slave not even finished just cut sloppily. The onesie is like a 12 month size not 0 to 3 months not even close. The onesie and head band feel apart in the washer
1.0,Super cheaply made the pink pair and the black ones broke as soon as I took them out of the package
1.0,"I went back and reviewed the photos and the description after I received my order.  I can't find anywhere that it says the plaid is gold, metallic threads...not white or cream as it appears.  I've requested a change in the description.  Pretty skirt but not what I wanted or expected."
1.0,For a child.
1.0,Kinda cute but several cup sizes too small!<br />Also it just fits weird. Not like any bra in the US.
1.0,"I was pretty disappointed in this dress. The material is really cheap. It feels a lot like cheap kid's bedsheets. The stitching on it also was unsightly. There were very visible (and poorly done) white stitches down the center of the bust, where the ruching is. In some spots the stitching even branched off a little. The armholes were also rather small/tight, so that it cut into my arms when I lifted them a little.<br /><br />Outside of that, the fit of the dress was fine. I'm 5'3"" and 140 lbs. I ordered a Medium."
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. The color is very drab, the quality is extremely poor. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Not only did it take OVER A MONTH to arrive, it’s wayyyy to large! On top of that, they CHARGE YOU to return. I’ll never buy again."
1.0,I'm sorry to write a bad review the pants are way way way to large even at the size I ordered will not buy again.
1.0,Ridiculous seems like a quarter toy machine ring. Do not recommend. 0 stars if I could not even rate it.
1.0,"No quality control!  I paid $27 for a hat I am embarrassed to wear.  The photo does not represent the cap received.  The top of the 2 crosses do not connect with the bottoms.  No one checked the work of the person who sewed this cross design on.  These caps used to have a bill made of cardboard, which is now made of plastic, which is hard to curve.  I purchased this hat in the past and loved it.  I am disappointed in the lack of quality.  There was no receipt to return the hat with, so I am stuck.  I was fleeced by this company.  DO NOT WASTE Your MONEY!"
1.0,"I was really happy with it at first but the key hooks are already breaking one-by-one after less than a month of normal use so far. Two have gone so far so I can only hold 6 keys now, and I'm not optimistic about the rest. Enough said I think."
1.0,"Very small and broke while I was putting in. Cheaply made, I do not recommend."
1.0,Too small I wear medium and Xl is still too small.
1.0,The watch is not well made. The band is not bendable. Its difficult to put on because of the band. Not a good product.
1.0,Even though the earrings were beautiful they were too tiny.
1.0,"Bought as a gift for my husband for Christmas, he wore it 1 time and the pearl snap buttons fell off."
1.0,"When I would breath in,  id suck the mask in my mouth!  Made my  Claustrophobia go into high gear.<br />Beautiful mask , horrible to wear"
1.0,"My friend got similar ones so I ordered some thinking they were the same but these are super stretched out. I have a pretty normal sized face lol but they don’t just drop below my nose when I wear them, they drop completely below my mouth to my chin. If I could return I would."
1.0,Ugly as sin and doesn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,"This blouse, I just did not fit in, properly. And was probably my fault in not noticing where the waist line came. Just hit me wrong. It's pretty; but was just not for me. maybe someone else. Not me."
1.0,Jacket made ok sized very small and took a long time to get
1.0,"Battery was bad, waste of money, couldn’t return"
1.0,"I bought this to replace one I had bought for a lot more money. This is an example of you get what you pay for. It was about $5 but is almost never works. You have to tap the face of the watch two times for it to display the time. This is the problem, I can almost never get it to work. I would return it but, as I said, it was only a few dollars and not worth the effort."
1.0,item was defective
1.0,"Similar, but not exact model as pictured in the advertising.  Very little polarization."
1.0,This broke after about 2 weeks.
1.0,"It is a beautiful dress indeed but IT  DOES NOT RUN LARGE. I don't know why people say that and look, I am not small. I am 5'7&#34; and weight 145. I normally wear size 6 and if is to small , size 8. After read so many comments saying that runs small, to order at least 2 sizes bigger, I ended up ordering 1x. The dress is HUGE one me. I contact the vendor and he said that he could not make the exchange. I am pissed as hell. Now I will have to pay to get my dress fixed to wear."
1.0,Too small can’t use it for anything
1.0,Came folded up. Large. Should have returned it
1.0,Trash
1.0,Broke on day 2. Band is massive and very easy to break. Do not buy
1.0,I bought a size up thinking I better be safe than sorry. This shirt was so large it's like wearing a tent. It is beautiful but just way too big.
1.0,"The light worked OK but there were only two settings. It's all on, or flashing. The last Lights that I had had five different settings one light to light three light for like five light and then flashing. These suck!"
1.0,Not photochromic... now I have to deal with a return.... thanks for wasting my time...
1.0,Nice design but way too small. It is built for a child. Super small neck opening. Fabric is nice including colors and design. Not recommended for adults.
1.0,It cost more for shipping and returning then it was worth. Never again. Badly sewn
1.0,Very bad fitting very much disappointed
1.0,Muy anchas y se ven de calidad muy mala. Parecen descartables.
1.0,I won't order shirts like this on here anymore. I found a store that has shirts like this and like many of the others that are cute and it's called Rainbow. I love Amazon so very much But it's the ppl selling that are lying. You need to call Amazon and say something cause the pictures are from catalogs like Venus and Bellami Hair and they cut the heads off of the pictures so you don't recognize the pictures but I recognize the clothing and when you're ordering they make the clothing as they go in some cases. It's happening on Facebook ECT...... I've been watching this stuff for a few years and they all are hurting so many ppl.  I hope this helps in some??
1.0,The product was OK but returning it was not easy and cost me half the price of the product .
1.0,Looks cheap. Feels cheap. Clasp is nearly impossible to use to remove the bracelet.
1.0,Terrible quality. you can see the pattern on the back through the front.
1.0,It changed color the next day and also broke i was very disapointed
1.0,"This was ordered by mistake but thought I would check it out before sending back. Would have definitely sent back!  Really stiff, way small and cheap. The front vertical zippers do not have pockets, just a zipper sewn into the front. The handles not attached well. The inside material cheep, the top zipper cheep. Total waste of money. Do not buy."
1.0,The bracelet had a terrible smell. It was a very strong 💪 smell. I actually had to wash 🧽 my hands. In the trash can 🗑 the bracelet went.
1.0,Not in line with the Message of the Harry Potter books at all.
1.0,"The material is awful and scratchy. This doesn't boatneck like the images show, and all edges (neckline and waist line don't hold a flattering shape at all. The edges bow out from the lines themselves making this look old, and worn out and I haven't even worn it once. I'm really disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,Feel like I'm wearing kids underwear. Way too small and tight.
1.0,I ordered a size bigger and it still was to small :(
1.0,"Most Amazon reviews tend to happen in the first week of purchase. But if you read reviews from people that have had them for awhile, they almost all break. Mine only lasted a month, and I only wore them maybe 5-10 times. I've worn glasses for years without a single break. These are just very low quality.<br /><br />Also the lenses are a cheap blurry material. My vision was worse when putting them on. This highly makes me doubt they are UV protected. Because if you're making them cheap everywhere else, they likely would there too.<br /><br />The worst part is, they do not allow returns after 30 days, which almost exactly how long it took mine to break. Clever scam. Do yourself a favor and don't buy something superior."
1.0,Felt like plastic
1.0,Irregular sizing
1.0,Too small order another pair
1.0,"NOT sizes 6-12. My 10.5 feet barely got in; once on, they ripped in multiple places within the first 10 minutes of walking."
1.0,"The stones were more white than blue, the ""gold"" appeared black. I was very disappointed. I will return these even though they were just for my 12 year old daughter."
1.0,Like the shirt it's a jersey type fabric and I was thinking it was a little more sleek than it is. Fits like a long sleeve tshirt. The zipper is cute in back and have no issues zipping and unzipping it to where I want it.<br /><br />Update 1/31/17- zipper broke the second time I wore this shirt.
1.0,It was the size of a kid.
1.0,"Unfortunately, this is not a compression shirt. It fit tightly against the body but does not ‘push in’ or ‘slim’ the body in any way. 1 star as the product cannot be used as advertised."
1.0,"Been waiting on refund for 20 days. As soon as I got it, tried in didn’t like and returned via UPS. Longest ever I’ve had to wait for a refund. No response from seller also."
1.0,I can see my tattoo through these don't waste your money.
1.0,"Very slick item and looks very nice. If it was quieter, it would get 5 stars....but now it stopped working, 5 years later."
1.0,Maybe want to wash it before wearing I got it out the bag put it on and was itching for a week it's in the bag in my closet
1.0,"Same as a previous review...the red strip is at the bottom hemline. The previous review showed the white shirt; I ordered the tan colored one hoping that it would not have the same issue, but it does. This kind of business practice is really bad."
1.0,Sizing was off. No way a medium. And the material was really cheap and the material felt weird
1.0,Cheap and bad design
1.0,Ring came broke the stone was not connected to the band. Why someone wouldn't notice this before shipping is beyond me. Piece of trash
1.0,"I really don't know how they fit, I cant get the stink washed out of them. they smell like some one drenched them in diesel. and it does not come out, I hung them out in the rain to air out, I have washed them 4 times used everthing I can think of including baking soda and vinegar, nothing will take out the smell!1!!!!"
1.0,"Hopefully this is just a defective one.  The glue was coming off and the hat itself is sewn crooked with a big crease in the front of the hat.:(<br />I ordered another one for my son so I'll see how that one comes in.  Not the right size for an adult though either, even though it says for a small adult or youth.<br /><br />Update...the second hat came from a different vendor and the same problem. so dissapointed:("
1.0,Too small and very thin planning to return
1.0,"If you want something for short term use, buy this product. After taking them on and off my glasses a few times the spring mechanism flew off and into the bushes. Total waste of money and I bought them in advance of my vacation so now I am past the point a refund. Ten bucks down the drain and now I have a useless plastic case and useless sunglasses that are supposed to work."
1.0,"Within minute of wearing this necklace, it fell right from my neck onto the floor. The chain was beyond weak. Complete junk."
1.0,Cute boots look just like the photo but my daughter had fallen 3 times wearing them !!! The heel is oddly placed under the foot and very narrow then slippery as well. I won’t be ordering these again.
1.0,Las plumas se cayeron casi todas en la primera postura
1.0,It broke too soon poor quality
1.0,This dress was nothing like the picture
1.0,"So... They look good, they feel good, and they fit well. But.... WHY do my hands smell like old fish after wearing them for about 20 minutes???? Seriously. What chemical, or fabric, or dye could cause this? Really disgusting, and it's not just me. People close to me could smell it after I took them off.  DONT y'all, just DONT. Seriously."
1.0,Fell apart .didnt hold up for even a month
1.0,Very disappointing.  Fell apart in minutes!!
1.0,Returned because too small. Buy a size up
1.0,"The first set I received broke, I ask for a replacement and still broke after 2 days of wearing it."
1.0,"Cute design, cheaply made. The stitching wasn't lined up and it looked like it was about to fall apart. I'm 5'7&#34; 123lbs and ordered a medium. The cuts are just all wrong. I wear a b cup an the top barley covers me. The bottom was super saggy between my butt cheeks. I has to return it."
1.0,"I’m 5’4” and I weigh about 125. I have a large chest for my frame, but I ordered a small. This fit well when I tried it on. Then I washed it. I feel like it came up about two inches in the hem. Very disappointing. The picture has the bottom of the dress at the bottom of the model’s knee. It’s probably about 2” above my knee, which isn’t a problem when I’m standing still. But if I sit or bend over to take care of one of my children I feel like my whole backside is exposed because of the short length of the dress and the flowy nature of the dress."
1.0,This product is not quality. The band came off and I almost lost my I watch.
1.0,This is 100% a waste of money it neve works because it’s always saying needs to reconnect and when it is connected it don’t receive or send messages to the other bracket so disappointed all the way around
1.0,"Loved the look, super cute and got a lot of compliments, but it turned my wrist green in a week. So disappointed"
1.0,Almost useless. The cord is way too big for the notches that secure the cord. An easy tug on anything being held by the Web Dominators unhooks them and drops your gear. Way too small and the cord is way too thick. Maxpedition Gear WDB4 Dominator are ten times better. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Zipper is a big weak point , they work well fit well but need to be pinned in place to stay effective ."
1.0,6 pack and only one mask came! So disappointed!
1.0,Extremely low rise. Not good for kids and or winter.
1.0,"I would have loved this shirt, unfortunately the left seam was not sewn up, and I was left with a completely unwearable shirt.  Very disappointing!!!"
1.0,Not at all what the picture shows
1.0,"The measurements should be reversed. Its about four feet wide, but barely long enough to cover your midriff area, let alone a swimsuit. Not like the photo. Looks very weird on. No way I can keep it or pass it to someone else. I was really looking forward to wearing this because the photo is great."
1.0,"I waited a long time for this ring. I ordered it on April 30th and received it June 8th. The way they made it sound it was being especially hand made. I expected more from this product than I received. It looks cheap and plastic, especially the roses. I will wear it but not as happy as would like to have been about it."
1.0,Disimilar item received.It’s a more fuschia color than light pastel pink depicted on it’s page. The pom poms are smaller.And I bought 2(1 for me 1 for my dayghter)  .I kept them because we needed hats& I did not want to go through the hassel of returning.
1.0,"Weird long length, more matronly than it appears in the photos. Cheap fabric. Return!"
1.0,Color was not khaki but an ugly mustard yellow.  Size too small to be comfortable
1.0,The lense fell out in about 4 days and could not be placed back in without bending the frame.
1.0,"Very disappointed, reordered it to the next size up and still was not fitting. Where it fit in length and bairly around the ribs, then the chest was to big.  Returned both dresses.  I'm sorry but will NOT delete my review"
1.0,Received but with NO tie belt. I was hoping to wear this weekend.
1.0,It is not a dress it is a beach coverup<br />Extremely disappointed<br />Also came from China put in mailbox 3 days after it said it was delivered
1.0,"I orederd a XL, I could not get into the pants because the waist was too small!"
1.0,very low-quality product
1.0,"This was shockingly small.<br /><br />Also, the material is very cheap and not at all like you would expect an apron to be like. It reminds me of the plastic play aprons you can buy for kids.<br /><br />I do not recommend."
1.0,It arrived and it was so cute and perfect. But I wash everything before it’s worn and it shrunk a full size and my baby boy never got to wear it. Really disappointed because it’s so cute but you need to be able to throw baby clothes in a dryer.
1.0,I don’t think we receive a real mood ring. It doesn’t change color. We’ve let 4 different ppl try it on and it stayed the same color. Hmmmm? Also the ring is extremely lighter compared to our other ones. And I paid a lot more for this one. My 10 year older was disappointed.
1.0,sent it back and herd nothing need size 24 but u don't have This one . what do I do with this we sent it back?
1.0,Only one apron in pack; it was sold as a pack of two.
1.0,"Very disappointed. This is a $3 lei, if that. Just as cheap looking as the bulk leis."
1.0,"The sticker says two pieces, the order says two pieces but I only  received one piece. I wish there was a way to get the other piece without doing a full return Bc I like what I got but didn’t get what I ordered and paid for."
1.0,It took way to long to get to me and there was no tag in dress to tell if it was small med or large but I ordered a medium and this was huge unable to ware may turn it into a skirt or something
1.0,Don't recommend . Nice packaging for a set of clothes pins basically is what you're getting
1.0,"Right out the box this resistors don't work on my 97 4runner,"
1.0,Light up when they want too. Remote don’t really control them but u get what u pay for
1.0,"I wear a size 16, ordered a 3x since I wanted to add leggings or another skirt, could barely get it on. and harder time getting it off without help. sending back."
1.0,"These are super cute earrings, but they broke while putting them on for the first time.  Very cheaply made"
1.0,The picture makes you think it is a long cover up...I am only 5'5 and it only came right below the knee.  The pattern pictured was not that same either.
1.0,"no stars , the worst fabric ever not soft just a mess like pillow case material"
1.0,"The picture shows yellow lens for blue blocking. I didn't notice the fine print saying clear lenses. Even worse, when I tested their blue blocking ability, they have ZERO. This company is stealing your money! Do fall for it! The glasses do NOT work."
1.0,I have worn and washed twice and they are still getting black dye on everything! They ruined my white fitbit band my phone case and a shirt and now the stitching is coming loose
1.0,"They cover my whole face, they folded them weird, the pocket gets too bulky. Should I keep going? I ordered some replacements since it looks too freaky big when my smile doesn't match up with what's on the mask. ReSewed them smaller hoping it would work but alas. It's only better. Not a perfect fit."
1.0,"Horrible, you can see right thru this material"
1.0,"It was heavy, hard to put on and the neck hole was too small. Uncomfortable and it was hard to move around while wearing it. I returned it. That is one of the best features of Amazon. Easy returnability."
1.0,My outfit came with the threads out in both pieces. Basically coming apart. Very poor quality.
1.0,"Terrible product. Took long to be delivered. Extremely thick, not breathable at all. Does not work for someone who wears glasses. When I tried to return the product, I was told it will cost over 100$ because it will need to be shipped back to China. Do not purchase, you can find much better products elsewhere."
1.0,Would no buy
1.0,"this product is way too tight.  get barely get over the head, and does not stretch easily to put around the face and nose.  materiel does not breath either.  very disapointed with this purchase."
1.0,Cut is large and sleeves extremely long.  I have to roll the sleeves up 4 rolls.  I wear only around the house.  Would not wear out.
1.0,"This thing felt crazy cheap, I mean I know it is cheap but I've had other styled watch bands that felt way better than this one did. Another negative is it seems to me they use the same band for each size of the Apple watch so when you wear it with the 44mm (which is the one I have), it's way too slim and makes it look funny. Returned it the same day. I probably would've kept it if it wasn't so slim."
1.0,Made for a 6 yr old not for women
1.0,Didn’t come the selected color. Not at all what is pictured. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Not the quality it claims to be, in the process of turning the chain around to take it off it popped and I’ve only had it going on it’s second month. Disappointed and shall not be ordering again."
1.0,Not satisfied with the product
1.0,"Earring broke within a few hours of wearing it. Bracelets come undone very easy. The look is pretty, just very low quality."
1.0,These socks are so thin. I wore them once and there is a hold already. Do not recommend.
1.0,Doesn’t snap in
1.0,i recieved a fake watch not as the picture .no name brand on the watch '''geneva&#34; and no manufaturer country also . a watch with no brand ???? false one not from geneva !!!
1.0,Nothing about this bag is good. Flimsy fake thin material. Doesn't hold its shape at all. Paper think leather type material. I feel cheap even trying to use it. Returning item. Never purchasing from them again.
1.0,"We knew it was a cheaply made ring obviously, but it has sharp edges which made it uncomfortable for my child."
1.0,"Cheap materials, netting started to snag after only a few uses.  It wont stay closed & stuff falls out."
1.0,Didn't like anything about this shirt but the price.
1.0,Terrible quality. See through and very cheap.
1.0,Tried the product and tested the results. Demagnitized a crew driver and pocket knife using the subject instrument by powering from ac outlet and pressing the red button with items on top.  Tested the items.  Still magnetized. No operating instruction was provided with the device.  Merchandise returned.
1.0,I wouldn’t purchase or recommend!!! They fall apart after a few machine washes!
1.0,Material is too thin and stretchy. I should have bought a small.
1.0,Se nota todo es orrible
1.0,Nothing like as advertised
1.0,Size was way to small and orange color was a plastic like material
1.0,Chain broke within 10 minutes
1.0,This was nothing like the photo. It did not have a large enough neck to hang off shoulder. It looked really boxy. I am returning it.
1.0,"Am I the only one sick of the bait and switch where the seller shows a picture of an original product, but sends you a cheap knockoff?  I know I'm not. Do not buy this dress. The material is the cheapest polyester you have ever see and it's virtually see through.  The fit is terrible, the white line falls in the wrong spot and throws off the proportions of the body. Don't waste your money. I bought this dress and after waiting three weeks for it, was excited to open it.  What a disappointment.  I immediately petitioned for a refund and will be returning it."
1.0,I purchase the underwear based on the size chart. When they arrived I tried them on and they fit. However after I wash them they shrunk and now I will have to give them to my daughter. Guess I'll keep looking for the best boyshorts.
1.0,It was NOT worth it! I couldn’t return it fast enough.
1.0,‘This product is a trash and they did not fill with boric powder for carrom board fame. Please don’t buy waste of money
1.0,Way to small and bad fabric
1.0,Sizing is WAY off with this apparel. I normally wear 5XL and this supposed 5xl would not even make it past my thighs.
1.0,Not the gloves I ordered. Too small. Not the same style at all. No white stitching. No wrist band. These are totally different gloves than what I ordered.
1.0,"My wife loved the look of these shoes, but they started cracking after she wore them for 10 hours."
1.0,These r way too big! He wears a size 8 and they fit about 2 sizes too big. Very disappointed!
1.0,"For the price , ridiculous cheapest thing I've ever bought , looks like something out of candy coin machine"
1.0,Worked at first but now it gives a rash. Did a nickel test and it tested positive. Don’t purchase.
1.0,This not authentic merchandise don't waste your money
1.0,I returned both dresses and expect a full refund.
1.0,"Not as adverrised!! First of all, it's not a ""real"" dress, it's a wrap dress, which is not depicted in any image. But it's also made wrong. For a wrap dress to work, the ties need to match up in such a way that it can wrap around and close at the side. Mine, the ties are both directly on the front and meet in the middle...wrapping is not possible, so its basically a hospital gown...with the same texture and everything. I'll be returning mine."
1.0,Had these for only 5 months and the color started to peal off after they got rained on. These are suppose to be anti saltwater lenses so why are they pealing? Called amazon and the rep that answered basically told me that 5 months is a long time so it’s possible they could be pealing already. We will be returning these right away..
1.0,The shirt was HUGE for a 7 year old. It didn’t say the sizes and age/ weight/ or give measurements.
1.0,"The shirt is huge as in way too big. It is also has no cotton in it. It's 95% poly, 5% spandex, and that's what it looks/feels like. R if you want a shirt with cotton in it but something else."
1.0,"La verdad no es lo que esperaba, el material se nota de muy baja calidad es como plástico, no estoy nada conforme con la compra!!!"
1.0,Zipper broke after one hour. So embarassing
1.0,I wanted to order a rack. This is not a rack.
1.0,"I'd like to give this ZERO stars!<br />It's humungous! It's about double the size of my actual arm,  and you cannot bend it to shape & adjust it. Total waste of money!<br />No wonder why they didnt have any pictures with it worn by a model."
1.0,The metal components in the set I received are gold so it is not as pictured or described.
1.0,I loved my blinged out band at first. Very pretty and the sparkly purple was adorable. But after just a week of wearing the band it started tearing. My heart broke.  I do not recommend buying this band at all.
1.0,"Cheap, wrinkled, ugly and too small in the bust. Typical cheap Chinese crap."
1.0,"Size is small and strange. Daughter just made 18mos, wears 12-18 mo clothing so I ordered the 18-24 size. The length is so short that it didn't come up high enough to cover her chest area. I tightened the (very long) straps as much as I could but there just wasn't enough material to cover her chest which is why I'm not posting a picture.  She's 2'7"" and 22lbs"
1.0,"Do not go by picture. It's extremely thin, almost see-through. I got XL and does not wrap around me or even close. It just covers the back. Hood is small too. The length is the only thing nice."
1.0,"The band feels cheap and the watch does not keep accurate time at all. Its a beautiful face but the band is horrible quality. I wore this maybe only three times before the fell apart completely. Would not recommend, not worth the price"
1.0,cute but did not like the top is too short  looks weird
1.0,"I gifted this product to my Mom.  She is in a nursing home, so I just found out yesterday that she received a felt blanket instead.  I am unable to return because of the retired date.  This is the first time I have run into the retired return date, but I am extremely disappointed."
1.0,Open the package to scan the product and found crack or broke part from the frame.
1.0,Bad material. Not cute.
1.0,Every necklace broke after being worn for 2 days...
1.0,The wrong color
1.0,"Do not waste your time! Does not look like the picture, cheap and bad quality. It looks like I ordered from wish."
1.0,This is the second pair I have ordered. The ear pieces have broken off on each pair and can't be repaired.
1.0,These are a men's large - they do not fit women's hands
1.0,swim suit material
1.0,"17mm broke on a drain bolt. I returned them. It wasn't the gearing,but the steel was weak near the head and snapped."
1.0,Shirt is perfect other than runs small.
1.0,"I didn't even get to wear it, it broke less than a minute after putting it on.. must have gotten caught in my hair or something."
1.0,"Does not look out fit anything like what the pictures elude to. Not a slim fit. Very short. I am 6' 1"" and ordered a large. Sleeves were still too short and an XL would have been way too wide and bulky looking."
1.0,"This is not water resistant at all! Very cheap material, horrible quality!"
1.0,Fabric was very poor and thin.
1.0,I received the loki helmet. it was a joke the horns didnt fit and kept comming off the helmet. The helmet /band that fits around the head was so out of shape it took me hrs to try to get it back to a wearable shape. i would not recommend this product i want my money back . no pride in making their product
1.0,It is not a sweat shirt.. Sucks.. And it small!
1.0,"Thought a 5X might fit a 1x/2x woman but these must be child sizes. The top part is super cheap, thin, raw edge material! Such a disappointment."
1.0,These were a terrible fit!
1.0,It's spandex and distorts the flowers. I literally donated it. Doesn't look like picture at all.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e4592a3efb4d5fe3c1728d3e5cb0af84]] their photo looks like it is good for a casual outfit but it looks like something you’ll be wearing in a costume party and only once.
1.0,"It’s acute bag, I wish the top was flat instead of angled when you close it but that’s a minor preference, what’s major is the chain breaking on you while your out… slightly embarrassing but the chain is definitely cheap… be prepared to rock it clutch style."
1.0,Flimsy and clasp won't stay closed.  Easily lose-able.
1.0,Worth the whole $ 2 I paid for it. WAY to delicate!  Broke almost immediately!  Won't buy anymore of these for myself. Maybe a cheap door prize.
1.0,"this watch is not a binary watch , you can read the time digitally , is not binary at all and the instructions are imposible I had to figured out by my self , and get this worst the quality is really bad the botton for the light got stuck and now is not working because if the blue light gone then you cannot see the hour so this watch only got working a month it is garbage"
1.0,"The top was a cute top it was the appropriate size which is the only reason I gave it a one star. The pants was uneven. One side was super short than the other. Had it been a little short to pull it off I would have kept it for my niece, but totally noticeable which is why i’m upset. This was a waste of my time."
1.0,"This bra is too small, material seems itchy and sizing is way off!  Will be returning."
1.0,Broke within one use! Very disappointed. Does not look like the picture and looks very cheap.
1.0,My boyfriend bought these and one fell off in a day. Don’t buy.
1.0,I ordered the orange and I regretted it immediately.. I look like a prison inmate with the bright orange lol! Fits great though lol!! I will be returning.
1.0,Garbage!!! Like worse than dollar store glasses. Already stretched out.
1.0,Received only one pair and it came with no backings. They feel really thin!
1.0,Not thick like I expected.  Returned
1.0,Chain didn't last long and I got an Ankh instead of a Leviathan cross... glad it didn't cost much!
1.0,"this was like an odd dress. there were bra cups that floated in the bodice, and it was down past my knees.  what kind of cover up is this for? so bad"
1.0,Fatal. Esa tela es de baja calidad.
1.0,"this shirt is very long, you can hardly tell that it has cats on the front because the print is so poor and faded"
1.0,Does not work. The buttons do not charge any settings. I can occasionally get the winders to rotate one at a time but not on a schedule. The very sparse instruction card it's virtually useless. A waste of $300.
1.0,"Don't buy the tan one, its way too thin and your nipples will be shown."
1.0,I got this item for Christmas on 12/25 and its 12/27 and my right shoe is already coming apart.
1.0,"Two of the Rings were tarnished already, very poor design."
1.0,Nice watch but the knob busted off on the second day. Now I can't change the time.
1.0,"The dress is empire. It does not hit at the natural waist, which creates an odd pouched bubble. The material is very thin and unforgiving."
1.0,Bottoms were WAY too small! I had to purchase separate bottoms because I really like the top. I would not buy again.
1.0,A gem fell out right when I pulled them out of the package
1.0,"The rings look nice and are easy to adjust size, but the color coating just slides off. So, garbage. Even a cheap toy should last a day of wear."
1.0,"You get what you pay for. I had holes in the inside seam of the thigh after one wear. They work fine as at home lounge wear but I wouldnt try to work out in them. They are also VERY long. I am 5'4"" and I have a good 6"" to spare at the bottom of the 2x. If you need GOOD yoga pants, keep looking!"
1.0,"OK Dokotoo - you lose. I bought this sweater THREE times. The first sweater I got was wonderful! it fit perfect and I loved it. Until I saw that one of the sleeves had missed a stitch and was already starting to unravel less than a week after I got it for Christmas. So I returned it and bought the second one, super excited because I loved it!. I also got a purple one that fits awesome. I posted a picture of how the purple one fits in this review.Then when I tried on the green replacement sweater, it was like somehow the sleeve length shrunk by 4 inches and it did not fit like the original one and is SUPER SHORT!! Like they sent me a size small instead of a 2XL!. I thought it must be a mistake, this cant be right. SO I retuned that one and ordered my THIRD sweater. Also to find that it is more like a medium length sleeved sweater and not the same length as the first one I had or the purple one I still own. Super frustrating, because when I find something I like that fits well, I will buy a lot of them in multiple colors. I will take a picture of how the purple one fits so you can see a side by side comparison, but unfortunately, I cant wear this too small in the sleeve sweater. I should have just kept the first one and repaired it as best I could (even though I shouldn't have to!) if I had only known the sleeve length would be drastically reduced. If someone from this store would get back to me and TELL ME they will make sure to send me the right size, I would order it again. Until then, I am not wasting my time."
1.0,"Seller uncommunicative, shirt ships from China.. poor quality graphics and printing."
1.0,I returned I am in the same day I receive that the material was kind of awkward quite thick do not get for summer too long
1.0,No good for heavy work...!
1.0,The size was not the size I wanted. Too small!
1.0,"The PU leather ripped shortly after I purchased the bag. I absolutely love the look of the bag as I'm a huge fan of Doodle Dogs and Doodle Cats. And the large size of the bag is terrific. But the ""closures"" on the bag are simple velcro strips and I think they might have caused the bag to rip. I applied tape to the rip and removed some of the velcro, hoping I could still use the bag. But the damage is very severe. I have requested a return and a refund and got it.  But I repurchased the bag and again it ripped where the flap folds.  Very disappointing!  Sad!"
1.0,"I bought this for my son in the Army, he said it is too small and will give it to his younger brother.  So buy a size up.  Large is too small for a person who regularly wears large.  My son is 170 lb. 5 ' 11&#34;."
1.0,"Low comfort, low value. I would say that it provides good warmth for its thickness, but there is no inner lining so it's extremely uncomfortable. For the high cost, I would think they could at least line the interior with something comfortable."
1.0,Neclklace arrived broken! In the process of returning it!
1.0,"As soon as I held one in my hands, I knew I made a mistake purchasing these &#34;Military boots&#34;<br />The bottom of the boots have practically no grip.<br />They say it has rubber soles but it feels like plastic.<br />Wasn't very comfortable either, Size down a full size if you really want these...<br /><br />Cool looking boots, but that's literally as far as it goes."
1.0,"The item was almost empty when it arrived, box and cloth were soaked. I was able to use it once and seems like it will work fine but very disappointed."
1.0,Nothing lije picture 👎👎
1.0,Very cheaply made. The plastic band seems like it will break within a few days of wearing
1.0,"Too cheap, fell apart"
1.0,"It was  very misleading, I only received 1 mask. I thought it should be 2 according to the description."
1.0,This photo does not match with the other photos.  You can find the different photos from a different seller: SuperGirl hats.  Ababalaya apparently had hijacked (photo-jacked) their photos to add to this site.
1.0,I bought as burping bid but the fabric is so thin that it soaked right through. It’s not worth of the money. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Ordered an XS, received a tag size 29 (which is listed as a Medium on their size chart).<br />*Very* disappointed.<br />Will update if resolved."
1.0,They’re pretty but smaller than they appear on the picture. And they’re not made from a single wire. One earring broke— the wire that goes through the ear separated from the decorative part— while i was trying to put the stopper on.
1.0,"These were sold as plastic post earrings,  after I got them in the mail I discovered they are metal posts, this is false advertising and I am very disappointed,  I am allergic to all metal besides gold in piercings and I only ordered them since they were suppose to be plastic posts, now I have a bunch of earrings I cannot wear, what a wadte of money"
1.0,"Funky material, can't see how this is 90% cotton"
1.0,I have no idea how sound or bluetooth work since they wont hold a charge. Very disappointed as were the family member I gave it to as gifts. Buyer Beware ....
1.0,Poorly made. Cheap materials.Dont waste your money
1.0,they all broke
1.0,They are so thin I have no idea how they think these will keep anyone's hands warm in the winter! Very unhappy
1.0,"These are definitely not toddler size, they fit me comfortably, so needless to say they did not work for the intended toddler."
1.0,"I ordered a small and got a medium instead, additionally the stitching on one side was totally out.  What a waste!"
1.0,Item was damaged
1.0,I bought this necklace for the cute best friend card and message that came with it for my best friends birthday....and it came with a basic cardboard backing. Cute necklace but I’ll be returning it because it’s not what it is advertised as and not what I wanted.
1.0,"I bought this for my sister & it broke almost immediately. She did love it. If I new how to contact company I’m quite hopeful they would send a replacement and then my review could be different. If a company stands behind their craftsmanship I would certainly give them another try, but not until then."
1.0,Looking through the lens it was super clear. I couldn’t wait to try it out until I did. When I stuck arc it about blinded me. I made sure nothing was in the way of the sensors. Tried it again and had the same outcome.
1.0,A surprisingly sloppy fit. Needed a belt.
1.0,"The first picture is my skirt, the second is the scarf that I purchased. The third photo is what the website says it looks like. Now you tell me they are the same.  I need something to match my skirt."
1.0,Definitely costume only glasses. Gave to my 10 year old because I couldn't use them. Not what I expected.
1.0,I just did not like the dress.
1.0,fit weird. sleeves were too short. the shirt was ill fitting and a little baggy.
1.0,Necklace does not have enough length for an individual with a thick neck.
1.0,"So thin they just fall out, and my earring holes are not stretched at all. Had to return them."
1.0,"Wrist part is not real it is made of plastic, the watch facing is real it works, but I don't recommend more for a child watch than adult."
1.0,Pero realmente no me gustó como el estilo yo quería uno que fuera más moderno pero eso es muy feo no me gustó quisiera devolverlo pero ya no sé cómo devolver
1.0,"Useless, it doesn't stay on ear. Crappy item. Never buy this. It's cheap but you pay more for shipping. First time purchased a crappy item."
1.0,Adorable little sandals but the back broke after wearing them for 2 hours on one of them.
1.0,This looks nothing like it does in the picture. the sweater looked like a potato sack had no shape to it at all
1.0,"Has no shape, cheaply made. Belt was peeled."
1.0,"They claim that you would get eight, I got six.  The scarfs came in a ziplock bag.  So sorry I got them because they are not even worth that price for the lies."
1.0,My son and his friend had to wear it sideways or over their head bcoz they couldn’t see the path they were walking on. My son fell two times. Not a great product.
1.0,Arrived broken.  It happens but the Broken Dreams collection isn't popular either.
1.0,🚨🚨 DO NOT BUY 🚨🚨 GARBAGE!!!My kid wore thus for 30 min and the entire side ripped! Now my child doesn't have a Halloween costume 😡
1.0,Item is cheaply made and the flower was busted off of the metal when it arrived.
1.0,Very poor quality. Cheap looking. Looked nothing like the pictures. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Poor quality.  First time I ever return an item to Amazon,  and questioning ever buying clothes from here again."
1.0,It was WAY too small. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
1.0,Only lasted 3 months and the leather strap broke.  Not good quality.
1.0,"Sizing is off-not even close to correct sizing. Too small. Sleeves are so short, undershirt sleeves hangs out of them."
1.0,Lose them same day. Not good at all
1.0,Love it! Definitely one of my new favorites.
1.0,I did not realize this was one of those sweatershirts with a half body. My daughter refuses to wear it. So buyer beware.
1.0,So as much as I liked the look of the lens and the ease of installing them they do not hold up to salt water. I have had the lenses only a month and the coating is already coming off the lenses.<br />They were always rinsed in fresh water and always cleaned using a microfiber lens cloth so I am rather disappointed. I was hoping this was going to be a low cost way to keep my Raybans going.
1.0,It looks very cheap and bad quality
1.0,I bought this925 Sterling Silver Peace LoveSign Round bracelet for my granddaughter because she and I share the Peace. It arrived and what a piece of junk! It bends like carnival jewelry. That much money I expected quality at least a little. It bent and it didn't take any pressure. I knew I wouldn't get anything better so I threw it away. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and this was the worst piece of jewelry. I have bought other jewelry by Chuuuuvora and it's always been good but not this time!
1.0,"Received a Headgirl instead of Headboy.....I mean seriously? Returning this close to Christmas, hope I get a new and RIGHT one, in time...."
1.0,I bought because I thought it was beautiful and wouldn’t change color but totally wrong.. After wearing it for couple of weeks my nose started to hurt so I took the Earring out and saw that it turned green and made my nose have a sore. Don’t buy it will turn
1.0,It broke when I took it out of the package
1.0,This is not wool. It is very very skinny too.
1.0,"I was happy with these at the beginning, but they tore after a few washes on delicate cycle."
1.0,"Style only good for teens/kids, the ear covers are loose don’t stay on adults ears."
1.0,It was a present for my granddaughter.
1.0,"The shirt is too small, and your 30% reshelving fee is utterly ridiculous for a simple shirt.m... good grief! I will never order from you guys ever again."
1.0,"Completely demolished brand new Apple Watch 5.  Destroyed both buttons and offered limited protection from elements.  If you’re looking for a protective band that protects, forget this one.  Will be filing a claim for repair costs to my watch!"
1.0,It was not a hard shell and didn't fit well on my daughter. She returned it.
1.0,"Disappointed! The print was just not the same or as pretty as the picture.  The fabric is cheap. Well, I probably shouldn’t expect a nice fabric cause price was cheap."
1.0,"It looks cool, but I was constantly reattaching it because it would not stay in place. I only wore it once."
1.0,"One feather comes broken, and after a week the other one broke as well."
1.0,Broken upon delivery
1.0,"This dress is very cheaply made.  It came damaged with rips at the seam and it had white marks on it like someone had tried it on before and left deodorant marks.  It also did not come with the belt as described.  ""PRETTYGARDEN Women's Casual Wrap V Neck Short Sleeves Polka Dot Printed Boho Beach Midi Dress with Belt""  Very disappointed."
1.0,Given as a gift. No feed back.
1.0,"Looks like a nice piece of clothing from photo, but is literally a lined garbage bag."
1.0,Ordered th 12 mm. They arrived but they are probably 1.2 mm.  See my photo below. Picture is of 12 mm earrings and the ones I'm returning next to a dime
1.0,Ripped up. Little holes up and down the legs and across the front. The seams were ripping.
1.0,"fell apart, not a strong necklace either"
1.0,"Loved the dress, but WAY TOO small! Ordered a 6, and it was closer to a 3."
1.0,"Disappointed. I like how they look but one of the side screws keeps coming out, the most recent time it was lost. I would return them if it wasn't too late"
1.0,The jean pockets are beautiful. However the jeans<br />was to small. I ordered size 12. I couldn't get them<br />up over my thighs. I returned the jeans them without any problems.
1.0,This dress was not what I expected it to be for a wedding. I would not recommend it.
1.0,The print came off separate from the  band in a week
1.0,Wayyy too small. I am 5’11” and this was like a shirt on me. It was also too small across my back. Had to return.
1.0,Th material does not allow any air through making the mask and filter useless. All the air ends up going out around your face instead of through the mask material.
1.0,"I gues this earrings are nice only, because the design is only one side of the each earring, so they send me 2 left earrings, I had to change the hook to the other side so I can wear 1 earring in the right side... that’s why are so cheap..."
1.0,"Was not true to size, fitted poorly."
1.0,Supposed to be 100 percent leather. All I got was something that is super greasy. When I trimmed to length it cut like paper with a pair of mustache scissors. Ended up buying 100 percent full grain cowhide leather belts somewhere else.
1.0,I liked the design.  However the charm is no longer silver.  It has turned a rusty brown color
1.0,Very breakable unless you just keep in the container..2nd pair NO MORE
1.0,Very tight! Not a comfy fabric!! Can't even use it! NOT happy
1.0,"Basically, this is super cheap, stretchy spandex-like material on a boxy, shapeless silhouette. Can't possibly be the same item as on the model besides the print. I returned it."
1.0,Threads are lose and falling out. Too small. Wrinkles easy. Shrunk when I washed it.the tag says dry clean and 35%cotton and 65% polyester like every other product from here.
1.0,Did not like this at all. The fabric was heavy and had zero stretch. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,"Way to small! Hips, hinnee, thick thighs! Usually wear a large in most leggings, these couldn’t even get them over my calves. Ordered a XL yet still way to small"
1.0,Weird cut. Not flattering and I returned it the day I got it
1.0,I ordered this and followed size chart and it was completely wrong. I ordered a XL and it looks more like a 2x or 3x.
1.0,"I purchased this as it originally fit a look that I was trying to achieve based on what was advertised in the photo. I gave this one star because:<br />- Horrible sleeves. I actually seem-ripped and removed them to make the dress look better.<br />- Horrible wrinkles and, with the pattern, the dress shows up very disheveled in photos. It took me a long time to photoshop out the mess made of this dress that I ironed before leaving the home.<br />- Did not last ONE regular wash. ... and this was the nail in the coffin. After one wash, the dress resembled a washcloth some people use to wipe their floors and other amenities with.<br /><br />I wish I had returned it before I decided to make alterations to it as I regret wearing and photographing in it. Definitely not worth the money and time spent on it."
1.0,To think rips easy
1.0,The material isn't great and it's a little longer than expected.
1.0,Ugly trim ruins the design
1.0,"Received broken. Even though it the watch case is big, the dial was pretty small and hard to read...sent back"
1.0,These shoes lasted my son 2 months. Shoes should last longer than that.
1.0,False advertising. The inside is not a heart. It is just spots. Lies.<br />I will say the ribcage design is beautiful and the item is much lighter than expected.<br />BUT it is NOT a heart design as advertised and described.<br /><br />But--- the shipping was fast.
1.0,"I ordered a size D , which has always been my size and I took measurements before ordering, and when I got the product, it is way too small. Plus, the outer edge of the bra shows through my shirt.  The image that amazon provides is very miss leading , I know my size and its still  too small. It took a long time for it to come in and I can't wear certain dresses or tops without an adhesive bra.  Don't order this product!"
1.0,"The disrespect is real, I will be finding out how to report this"
1.0,"I bought this watch for work as a night shift nurse to replace a previous one I had by the same manufacturer. While they are both &#34;Geneva&#34;, the writing of the brand names appear different, so they are probably knock-off's made by different people. That would not bother me as this is a pretty inexpensive watch. I did however buy this only due to the fact it was supposed to glow in the dark. Mine does not glow at all! Even when exposed to light prior to going into a room. Not as advertised!"
1.0,"These are okay if you don't mind multiple pulls in the thread, holes, and extremely scratchy and see-through fabric."
1.0,"Shape if the ring is misrepresented. It was cheap though, so it's like whatever. I wasn't expecting much. You get what you pay for here."
1.0,They couldn’t pay me to keep this jacket
1.0,Finish peeled off on the glasses with sunscreen
1.0,Product not what I was expecting.
1.0,I couldn’t even get the sleeves on
1.0,Strap broke within first 5 minutes of wearing it the first time. Although it’s cute I need functionality more. Gave it 1 star because 0 stars is not an option.
1.0,The color is extremely faded.  It is supposed to be black and the color appears sun faded.
1.0,Very bendy. Vending machine quality.
1.0,Chain was missing. I only received earrings and pendant. Looks like I won’t be able to wear the necklace.
1.0,"I tried to cancel order one day after ordering and was refused. They are charging me $5.00 to return. The top came in and is huge, shiny cheap ugly material, looks nothing like picture and I’m out $5.00. DO NOT BUY!!"
1.0,A lot smaller than shown..
1.0,"UPDATE: the company contacted me and offered a refund or replacement. I liked the hat so decided to give it another try. It's winter now so I won't have info on durability for a while, but I appreciate the customer service!<br /><br />The second time I used it the brim separated complete from the rest of the hat - irreparable. Too bad because it was otherwise a nice hat- just what I was looking for."
1.0,"I have no where to put this! At first, I expected to be able to place this over the dashboard of my car, but it does not come with any back straps that can be used to hang it from anywhere. It's just a flat panel in the back and only useful inside of a bag. I may just be ignorant on where else I can use this other than the inside of a bag, but, as it stands, it's pointless without having the ability to hang it onto something so it can face forward."
1.0,"The cut of the skirt is nice. However, the material is cheap looking and the size is much smaller than expected."
1.0,"Extremely short in the front, and I am short, at 5ft 4 inches! I never wear it.<br />Weird material. Not a fan<br />."
1.0,Not a true L size .. The size not same<br />I ordered in my size are very tight like biking shorts. They also have a small hole in the left-hand pocket that was there when I received them. I am disappointed in these shorts and won't be ordering from them again.<br />These gym shorts were well made but too tight on me.
1.0,"Wasn't expecting much, but this is such poor quality I was surprised."
1.0,Not normal fit and missed return deadline.<br />Will not try to buy from here again
1.0,Awful shapeless
1.0,Very disappointed. NOT FOR JUNIORS OR YOUNG WOMEN. Didn't fit or look like the image at all. You would have to be a non mature girl in pre-teens to fit in this like the image. XXL must be a youth XXL size.
1.0,The tank tops are extremely tight and the size seemed to just determine how long they were.
1.0,"Extremely too small and material is junk, dont buy this unless it's going on a baby doll. Also took approximately 1.5 months to com."
1.0,Fell apart when washed
1.0,"sizing is way off,sent back with tags still on and never received my refund."
1.0,Cheap is an understatement. They hardly hold the glass frames. Shouldn't be on Amazon. Garbage.
1.0,"Did not like the feel, but very pretty putter!"
1.0,The material was really cheap. I would not recommend purchase.
1.0,"Tl;dr: ripped irreparably in multiple places while I sat at a desk at work due to poor quality, do not buy.<br /><br />I loved this shirt at first - it looked very good and professional. The quality was cheap, and I expected a bit better given the cost, but oh well, I liked the look. I wore it once with no issues and washed it delicately in a delicates bag, also with no issues. Today while I was wearing it at work (where I sit at a desk all day) it became irreparably ripped in multiple places, which was extremely embarrassing. I am appalled at the utterly terrible quality and will be throwing out the second shirt I got from this seller in the fear that it may also rip horribly while I am wearing it at work."
1.0,Headbands always slip off my head and these are no different I guess they work for some people but not for everyone.
1.0,"Love the leather- very soft . But...unlike the picture and description, there is no place for bills. Had to return."
1.0,"I went by the size chart and I can't even get the dress over my rear. I am not overweight by any means. I can't see in any way how to request a larger size and return the smaller size. Please have someone contact me from your company. I love the dress, but can't wear it! I would like to get a larger size, if possible."
1.0,One of stone fell out having only worn once.
1.0,Does not look at all like picture.  Really cheap construction and threads hanging off hem.  Ugh
1.0,The color was not the same as the picture.<br />The waistband was sewn incorrectly.
1.0,"Upon receiving this nightgown, I had to immediately wash it because there was a horrific chemical odor. I washed it in warm water with a very mild laundry detergent; then placed in dryer on low heat. It came through fine; or so I thought. I worn it briefly before the material separated across the breast. The nightgown was not tight fitting.<br />I grew up with a seamstress, so I have to assume it was an error in the  weave of the material.<br />It saddens me because the nightgown really looked nice."
1.0,"This bra was almost a pastie on me. I wear 42 D and it is maybe a 36-C in my opinion. I could get it on but definitely not wear it. I saw one more of this brand that I will try and purchase in hopes it fits better but if not, than Coobie definitely not for plus size women."
1.0,Very cheap and flimsy looking. The headband was u even and the hears were too close together. I had to return them. Sorry
1.0,This dress was huge in some areas and small in others. It fit around the bust and arm area but had so much extra fabric and room around the waist. It was very short and very thin. When you walk around it rides up in an awkward way even though it’s too big and baggy in the middle. I don’t think sizing down would have even helped.
1.0,The  fitting chart provide when ordering was completely deceptive and useless. I don't feel that I can trust conversion size charts.
1.0,"I was so excited to get this bag, but as soon as I opened it, I noticed strings hanging off it.  With further inspection, realized that the stitches were coming undone and that around the bag, the stitch was all off. If I pay full price for a loungefly bag, I want loungefly quality. This seemed like product seconds or something!"
1.0,Very thin material. Broke the first day of use.
1.0,Brokes the same day just folding it back
1.0,It was to tight on the leg with the strip
1.0,Very cheap... they were all exactly alike.
1.0,I sent this dress back for a refund.I ordered a medium and it was too small.There was no button at the waist and it gaped open.Was just poor quality.
1.0,"Soft and fit perfectly but no staying power on the backside. They cause a ride-up or wedge issue (if you catch my meaning). It’s a shame, you’ve almost got it!"
1.0,"The description of these socks state that they are cushioned; however, when I received them the packaging specifically stated ""lightweight"" no show socks which are very thin.  This would be fine if that is what I wanted, but I specifically ordered these because the description stated cushioned.  This is false advertising and now interestingly they are no longer in stock."
1.0,They do have a seam. They aren’t stay up. Save your $
1.0,It broke the first time my daughter wore it
1.0,"Cheaply made,broke the 1st day wearing it"
1.0,They look awful on. Do not like them at all.
1.0,You send me a product that doesn’t match the description… the belts doesn’t fit my MK watch… please refund immediately!
1.0,This particular product runs very big for its size.  Get one size down if you have to get this model.
1.0,"Ring was much larger than i expected making it appear  &#34;unreal&#34;, and the stones fell out almost instantly, very poorly made."
1.0,"It looked fine and worked well for 3 days.  On day 4 the pin with the crystal on the end popped out of the primer pocket, and the crystal fell off shortly after.  I'll probably de-activate an unfired primer and then seat it in the pocket after soldering the pin in place.  I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"Description misleading, these are NOT fleece.  just regular leggings!"
1.0,I doubt this is 18k and the stone is huge. The whole thing looks cheap and it’s very poorly made.
1.0,names are too small
1.0,Received today and excited to gift to my niece but highly disappointed as it has both a horrible smell and the screen print is printed poorly and smudged. I could not recommend based on this poor quality.
1.0,Will not buy this brand again. I bought a XL shirt and it was actually maybe a small. I gave it to my daughter who wears a size 2 / extra small and it was tight on her. The arm holes were made for a two year old. After reading all the reviews the sizes are either too big or too small the company needs to use an appropriate sizing chart and do quality checks on their clothes.
1.0,"They are to hard, stiff and there is nothing on bottom to be comfortable.  They are horrible but I like the fluffiness and color but to thin on cushion.  I really need to send back for refund."
1.0,"I did not get the glasses I ordered. I ordered blue, got black & totally different style. No paw prints on lenses. Very disappointed."
1.0,Product received with no straps and torn apart in the inside! Stitching coming apart daughter was very disappointed bc she was excited about a new purse! Would have given half a star if I could!!!
1.0,Absolutely worst ever😡😡😡😡
1.0,"100% polyester so it's not silk or satin, doesn't work for me to help protect my curls, also smelled like chemicals when first removed from package, and very very tight fitting (I have a small head and it still have me a headache to wear)."
1.0,"Shoes are cute but opening for foot is too small/not wide enough.  I can't fit them on my 18 month old, so I can't use them."
1.0,The mask has white spots all over it . I am not happy about that
1.0,AWFUL
1.0,"I don’t know what I was expecting.  You get what you pay for.  Fit is good,  fabric is very cheap and thin,  color is off.  I ordered this in the beginning of June and it arrived yesterday 8-19- came from China"
1.0,Sweatshirt was to small for the size that was offered
1.0,I did not get the color I ordered! Not even close ! I got red and black ! How did that happen ? The scarf quality is very nice ! I needed the color I ordered
1.0,super loose.  Looks like a cutout from leggings and stitched at the edges.  Elephant design in the picture and when actually worn is completely different.
1.0,I ordered this as a gift & ordered a 4x....<br />It was more like a 2x...<br />It had a horrible chemical smell as well
1.0,Broke first time I used them and they didn't even fit in the case properly tried to return them and was shrugged off
1.0,"It’s ok, a little short"
1.0,I give it no star. It broke after 2 days. Made cheap. :(
1.0,This is for my mom and this is how the necklace came. I sure hope I can get this untangled or she’s not getting it. Waste of money!
1.0,"I'M 5'9"" AND THE SHIRT WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO WEAR AS A DRESS"
1.0,"Really long. I have a higher septum piercing but it's still really long. Also is poorly made. The clicker was loose as soon as it was opened and the ""arm"" swings loose and to either side of the ring making it nearly impossible to put in."
1.0,"Just like service ribbons available online. Complete bs.<br /><br />I was in the Corps, but did not go to sniper school. Just an 0331, and wouldn't wear one of these. Same as stolen valr. Instead, I bought a full .45 acp round I wear."
1.0,"The robe tie is the color of the pic, the actual robe is a dull plum looking color. No thanks, threw it away."
1.0,"Very disappointed in this watch, I received this watch, the second hand works,  the minute and hour hands do not, the winding piece does not allow you to wind it,  each time I push it in to wind it, the hands move, very disappointed."
1.0,"Colors are orange and brown, which is strange for a Christmas outfit. The sleeves are extra long but the “dress” is very short; it’s more of a shirt than a dress. It’s very cheaply made."
1.0,"Too big at the top and small at the waist. I'm usually medium but ordered large, based on the reviews.<br />Maybe for women with a large bust and a small waist, definitely slim because the bottom tends to make you look with big hips!"
1.0,Tried it on and strap broke !  I am so annoyed.  Eve they offer free shipping back it’s a pain in the rear .. can’t you guys do the basic thing and make sure you stitch it correctly.  This is the second dress in a month thar had the same issue.
1.0,Big s*** for me!
1.0,"The fabric of the forró of the pockets, is blue with white balls .... totally wrong !!!"
1.0,So the butt area has all this cinching that makes you look like you have a Shar-Pei butt
1.0,I wore the slippers 2 weeks around the house and got a big hole in the heel. I sent them back for a refund.
1.0,I sleep in these and there is a ring in the strap that is uncomfortable. And the elastic in the bra doesn’t work very well
1.0,Got one wear out of them. Shrunk after washing.
1.0,i dont recomment this product to anyone.. the material really sucks! i guess you get what you paid for right.. dont buy. worst material ever!!!
1.0,This is not the listed product. this is a ridiculous flimsy cheap mask with a couple eye holes . My son will not be able to use for Halloween. I want my money back!!!!
1.0,I received the necklace and the latch was already broken.
1.0,Bought these for a neighborhood an event and many broke as soon as they came out of the package.
1.0,I like them but the rods aren't plastic they are metal which is very miss leading
1.0,I got these boots but was not happy with them
1.0,Cleaned them with a micro cloth and spray and they ruined
1.0,Half of the anklets didn't fit and the one I wore yesterday broke half way through the day.
1.0,Liked nothing they look really big stiff and fake!
1.0,Ordered an XL pair of black tassle shorts and received what looked like an XS . Very disappointed with the size.
1.0,It would open but not close.  I returned it.
1.0,"My son is a big kid. He usually wears 5t, and I bought him a 4t shirt. And this shirt is huge. Is like a size 8 or 10<br />I’m upset that he is not going to be able to wear it for Christmas"
1.0,These gloves are horrible. Nothing like the picture. They are not completely stitched. The fingers along the seams have many holes. The material is thin and see through. The gloves I received in the mail look nothing like the gloves pictured.
1.0,Don’t believe it would fit a toddler. Very disappointed. Never buy from distributors again.
1.0,Not cotton!
1.0,"Dress is thin and color is not as vibrant as picture.  Delivery took 12 days. I didn’t expect a lot for $10 and it’s definitely a 10$ dress.<br />I am  usually a size 2, ordered a medium. It’s a little big but I think the small would be tight on chest"
1.0,Just a sad item  Does not fit well at all. Material is bad
1.0,"I thought these were a great compression fabric at first, but immediately found out the fabric runs at the seems with ANY movement, it happened the moment I put them on.  I am returning these, they only look good if you hold still and I intended to workout in mine. I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 123, I'm muscular and didn't even stretch the size small much at all but as soon as I bent down and squated they were done. Competely useless."
1.0,The pants said come ans Olay and the other leg wild at narkt!!!! What the hell is that? The outfit itself is cute but the spelling is completely off!!!! They should have double checked the spelling before shipping it!!!!!
1.0,They are HUGE and hang so far down it stabs me in the chest. I can not wear them without injury.
1.0,Read the reviews before I bought this to decide what size to buy. Ended up with an xxl however looks like a medium. Disappointed
1.0,Way too big and no option to return. Worthless to me.
1.0,These socks seem to be too large. I am 7.5 and  they are still too long. They are also too high on the ankles and looks more like regular socks on me.  I guess they will fit size 8-8.5. I wouldn’t recommend this product for anyone with small feet.
1.0,I just got these today. Washed/dried and put them on. After only wearing them for a couple of hours one of the eyelet holes (where drawstring goes) has already ripped! Not acceptable!
1.0,"Material is soft, but ridiculously thin. Seriously ladies, wear something under it if you don't want to be arrested.<br /><br />The print is weak, thin and the material is puckered and folded under it....<br /><br />I didn't even want to write a review. I've had this thing for months.<br /><br />The only thing it has going for it is that it's soft and fairly long and I can use it as an undershirt for some of my shorter t-shirts for work. Where I work solo for 12 hr shifts in a lab. Where no one cares what I look like.<br /><br />Seriously, I was really looking forward to this one."
1.0,I didn't even bother to try on this dress. The fabric was awful. It was like plastic coated polyester. Sending it back.
1.0,"THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED DAMAGE. One of the layer was broken, the top layer to be exact."
1.0,The item was not of any quality. Spent 50 bucks for a 10 dollar umbrella. Refund was only for 2.39. Some nonsense about 38 restocking fee. Completely unacceptable!!!! Avoid this company!
1.0,there is not similarity to real ones
1.0,Great for holding glasses on your head don't fall in water though if so kiss your glasses goodbye as you watch them sink
1.0,I bought the purple one for my mother she had it on for hour and washed her hands and three of the diamonds around the heart fell out. So I guess you get what you paid for.
1.0,Zipper broke after one use
1.0,Originally I gave these five stars because I really liked them but I’ve only been wearing them for a few days and the paint is starting to chip off they actually make my ears really itchy and smelly which I hate and I don’t really feel like they are the exact size they say because they fall right out if they get bumped
1.0,Bigger than expeced.
1.0,"I know real fur when I see it and touch it and this is not faux but real rabbit.  I hate real animal fur, can't stand the touch of it, so I am returning."
1.0,Tried on and size didn’t match other clothes.
1.0,"The legs of this pant were not wide, bell-like or palazzo like, which is how I read the picture to be. I am rather disappointed."
1.0,"I ordered tow of them, one form my wife and myself. Both were very small. Had to return them."
1.0,It was supposed to be two bows and there was only one in the package.
1.0,"I hate when I think I'm buying something, and receive something completely different. The crystal fireball is nothing like the picture, and the little heart at the chain extension does not exist. Amazon needs to watch this seller."
1.0,Coming apart in many places out of the bag.. too bad it's pretty. Beading is missing in several parts all around the top. Now we are under a time crunch to find a dress..
1.0,"Very disappointed,  the metal part of earing arrived all rusted"
1.0,"So I got these as a gift and after wearing them for the first time I noticed a few things. First, it is OBVIOUS that it is NOT the material listed. It is plastic acrylic type things. The carvings where terrible and how extremely sharp points all around each earring. Both earrings left a black residue on my earlobes so I washed them with soap and water only to reveal that the black paint came off.<br /><br />Buyer beware this is not worth the money and I am glad this was a gift from a family member. They feel bad that they got me terrible earrings but it happens. Hopefully, the vendor will see the errors and fix them. I would love to have these as they are listed and not some cheap earrings. This a fraudulently listed as natural material."
1.0,Fit small!
1.0,"After one wash, you’ll have strings everywhere. Not a good workout material either."
1.0,Not what I was expecting. I sized up and still it was too small. Would not buy again
1.0,"very poor quality, came with one of the ends about to be cut. It is not possible to be used."
1.0,This shirt like everything else was not cotton but a slick cheap polyester.  Would not waste your time and money!
1.0,"For years, I've worn Shock Absorber sports bras for HIIT and running, because at 38E/F, I needed some major duty bras.  In the last year, I lost a fair amount of weight (including 4+"" from my bust), so it's time to replace them. That brand is expensive, though, and since a recent bra fitting put me down into a D cup, I asked other running friends what they wore. SYROKAN bras were popular with other D/DD runners, so I thought I'd give them a try. I'm really disappointed.<br /><br />First, I think this bra runs really small -- even though it was a DD cup size, I'd put it closer to a generous C.  Yes, it squashes things down (expected with a good running bra), but there is some serious side-boob spillage going on. I have to lift up the cup edges and tuck the outside quarter of each breast in. The problem is once the sides are in, the top is in danger of spillover. When I wore it to do yoga and bent into a forward fold and thought I'd pop right out the top. (Yikes!!) Second, despite flattening my breasts down into my chest, there is almost no lateral or vertical motion suppression. Jogging in place for a HIIT warm-up, I had to put my hands up to hold things still. I'm going to donate this one (I'm sure there's a lady out there who it will work for), but I'm not even going to bother with a different size and just suck it up and spend the money on what I know works for me."
1.0,Broke after two uses... lenses fell out.
1.0,"Wow people could see my undies if I wore it out, good thing I tried it on and saw it was way too short. Im a size small but whoa! It was like above my panty line"
1.0,"after 6 month, it turned too lose"
1.0,Looked fabulous when I tried them on. Wore them once for Valentine’s Day and they tore at seam. I was walking around with a hole in the most noticeable location. Horrible quality.
1.0,"The zipper is of cheap quality, I gets stuck at  the top or get stuck in the middle and you can’t get out of it because your neck stuck in it. I don’t even try to use the zipper anymore. Worst Coat I I’ve ever ever gotten ‼️‼️"
1.0,"Eventhough it was marked xl, it sure wasn’t.<br />I order XL on pants made in USA and no problem.<br />But these were probably a size 12 in USA sizes.<br />Disappointed"
1.0,Looks cooler in th picture. It feels and is very flimsy. Bulky on the wrist and armband is very thin stiff nylon. Watch face extremely easy to scratch. Totally not worth the price. I pressed the sunken in button on one side to reset the time and the screen's internal liquid cracked in to glass/plastic.
1.0,Cheap plastic and way too big for average person.
1.0,Wrong size?
1.0,"This item does not have any green whatsoever.  It is complete black, Horrible.  Do not buy"
1.0,My kiddo was able to use this suit 2 times before the stitching came apart.
1.0,"This was really cute, perfect fit and would have worked perfectly however, I didn’t even make it out of my dressing room when the string broke and beads went everywhere. I’m am processing for return."
1.0,These arrived with two different chains and dangling gems on each cuff respectively! Avoid this one; it's not even worth the couple bucks.
1.0,Items are not sterling silver. Started flaking and changing color after wearing. The end piece also broke extremely easy while taking the necklace off
1.0,"I just received this product not to long ago and I would like to send it back but I feel like its going to be nothing but a pain to try to get it returned. The shirt is nice the material is decent, however I thought that the shirt wouldn't look so uniformed which is one of the main reasons I got this shirt. I usually wear a large and I got it a size large due to it being amazon and I figured it was coming from china which there sizes of course run small but. This shirt more than likely will go to someone who can fit it because it's not worth the time or hassel to try to send it back."
1.0,The designs on these clothes are infringing Intellectual Property. They belong to Colleen Doran. Please don't buy these clothes.
1.0,"I was very disappointed with the earrings.  They are so SMALL you can hardly see the stone.  Actually un-wearable.  They are not as displayed in the picture at all.  I think the picture is very misleading.  I would like to send them back but don't know how.  Can you tell me how to do this.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Carolee Kirk"
1.0,"These hoops are extremely hard to open and close, and the posts are flat, not round, so they’re very uncomfortable once they are in."
1.0,"Didn’t hold up. (No punn intended)<br />Where the buckle stem goes through the hole, the belt begins to crack after just a few uses. The belt loop that keeps the belt end close to your waist didn’t last. I really cannot endorse this product."
1.0,The spinner did not flow freely and the spinner ring kept coming off the main ring.  Plus the gold platting did not hold up.
1.0,I was very excited to receive this product but when I received it all that excitement died very quickly mask is very flimsy does not fit your head and the jaw is so loose you cannot connect it to your chin where you can actually make the mouth move do not buy this product
1.0,Ordered exactly by the size chart. Not even close. The forgot the people have backs and shoulders bigger than their waste.... I tried clearing this up with the vendor directly and was sent a self serving email.....
1.0,"The two bracelets were attached by a tiny piece of plastic like those that normally hold a price tag to a piece of clothing.  I grabbed the two bracelets and gave them a tug and instead of the plastic breaking, the bracelet did.  Poor quality..."
1.0,Too small and see through.
1.0,"These face covers met my expectations as far as material. However, two of the six masks differentiated in color from the ones advertised. I bought this pack because I liked the navy blue and gray masks, but the navy blue came out to be more like purple and the gray is very off as well. If you don’t mind the color, this works but if you buy this because you had the navy blue or gray In mind like me, you’ll probably end up not wearing them and end up with 4 masks instead of 6."
1.0,It was supposed to be a gift for Valentine's day but it didnt go well.
1.0,This doesn’t fit at all like the pictures. It’s wide and not long and the sleeves are short and wide. I’m disappointed.
1.0,This product was phony quality<br />It had NO rick rack sole it was flat sole<br />It really big around my foot n fabric  poor  quality<br />But the toe support was fine<br />No happy quality ...<br />It’s not the true shoe..<br />I need the Rick rack wedge sole n tighter around foot<br />No I do not recommend this n wish amazon would stop allowing poor quality as a choice<br />To much time returning products hmmmmm!
1.0,I wouldn’t order. Much smaller than described. I have already opened it and tried it on or would have returned.
1.0,Item was too large and did not fit as expected. Looked nicer on the model than in actuality. No zipper for easy use.
1.0,"Came corroded, I had to return. Looks nothing like picture"
1.0,"When I received this locket, I was very disappointed. It doesn't close correctly, and has light scratches all over it as though it had been rattling around someone's desk drawer for a year."
1.0,Rough material and moderately uncomfortable.
1.0,I had to send it back they look totally different when you get them as the picture they're way too big and I just didn't like him.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and if you want to return you have to pay. Don’t order any of these products.
1.0,Way too small. Like for a child
1.0,Sz 8. Way too small for sizing .
1.0,Purse is way to small.  Though color is perfect  Not big enough for my needs.  Will have to keep searching for new bag.
1.0,"This watch was a great disappointment.  Could have purchased a Seiko for same or less money and get a far superior product.  This watch is really terrible, it arrived not working with a screw loose in the automatic mechanism.  I had it repaired at the H&G watch company in Trinidad.  The watch is cheaply dipped and looks inferior, like I purchased from the drones of hustlers between traffic in third world countries selling knock off items. Sorry Amazon does not offer a zero or a minus star category, as for sure they would have been serious contenders for the position of terrible. The trouble with Amazon or online purchasing is that you buy on the net at your own peril. I believe people will still rely on the good old store since you can select what merchandise you want, feel it and use it and the issue of sending back is always an excellent choice, but cumbersome and a long process.  I certainly do not recommend this watch."
1.0,This came all wrinkled up with a funny smell to it. Tried washing it but it never had a good shape after that. Never wore it at all. Save your money and buy a different product.
1.0,"very disappointed...was sized like it was made for a child. Gave it away to a young, skinny girl."
1.0,"The boning in this shaper are too soft, so if you bend over ir hunch a slightly bit, they will pinch your ribs terribly. It's also long and will flatten half of your bottom if you have a short torso and hourglass shape. I would not recommend this product unless you plan to stand up completely straight and have a very long torso."
1.0,Fits super small. Size chart is way off and no labels or gift receipts inside.
1.0,"Came a totally different dress that I order. Impossible to use it or modify. I order the dress in the picture and came a one shoulder blue drapped dress, and too big."
1.0,The dog fell off the ring and was lost almost immediately.
1.0,Broke soon after I received it
1.0,The heating elements are held with weak glue/tape stuff.  The came out very easily.  These are the kind of gloves you'd find at the dollar store. The It was cumbersome to use. I wasted my money.
1.0,The color was lovely but show was longer than expected and it was quite hard and not soft to walk in.
1.0,"Ordered size 6 for my kiddo. Shirt was way too big, it hangs off her. The pants BARELY fit. They ripped when we tried them on. Outfit looks cute, but sizing is an absolute mess!"
1.0,Absolutely horrible material
1.0,"After one week of use (even it was just after a couple of days) both shoes are damaged. Yes, my kid is very active. But it is the only pair that has this issue. Never happened with other brands. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,Quality is very bad. It left black strikes on our wooden floor! It was thrown into trash!
1.0,"I hate how it fits, not for me...."
1.0,A total waste of money! the frames were bent where the arms attach so bad that one ear piece would only open to about a 45 degree angle.
1.0,Love turquoise but when I received bracelet it is very cheap looking. The lobster claps was also broken.
1.0,It was suppose to be a Christmas gift but the zipper in the cost was horrible.
1.0,After one wear the gloves were not usable.  The liner came out all tangled.  We could not insert it back.  Very disapointed.
1.0,"Super cheap sunglasses, I normally get a pair like these for trips if I misplace them, then I'm only out a few bucks compared to my Rayban. These shades attach all kinds of oils and dust so keep a lens cleaner handy, you wouldn't believe how much time it takes to clean, more so than wearing and they fall off the hinges too easily. Save your money and pass on this brand."
1.0,"Cheap junk. Similar outfits on Amazon have an embroidered ghost, while this one has a giant ugly screen print. Also, this was much too small with inaccurate sizing. Returned immediately."
1.0,I ordered the black version and they didn't have the skulls on them. pretty disappointing.
1.0,Worn it twice; a hole near the heel. I can’t believe it.
1.0,Update! Had the big purse about 6 months.. the strap broke. The little one broke within the first month. Don’t waste your money. It’s not worth it.<br /><br />I'm actually very disappointed with this purse. It is not as big as the pictures make it out to be. There's no way a full size iPad would fit in this purse. The material is not even the same as what's shown.  The inside has minimal space. I bought this thinking based on the pics it would fit my tablet and stuff while I travel but it won't. And it didn't even come with the cute feather charms which is what drew me to the bag.
1.0,Way too shiny super tight and they strings were thick shoe lace type....... returned the same day it was delivered
1.0,The pockets on the side of this dress make you look extra large.
1.0,I liked them but I wore them once and they broke the hook came right off and I can't find it so I'm very sad
1.0,HAVENT RECEVIED DDRESS
1.0,I wish I could give negative stars. I ordered a 2X and it fit like a medium or even bigger size small. would not even cover me! very bummed and will not buy ever again
1.0,This is possibly the most ill fitting item I ever purchased online
1.0,These were easy to small and wouldn't even go up my husband's legs
1.0,Distorted view under water
1.0,Run EXTREMELY small. I’m not a big person by any means. I ordered a large. I had to give it to my 13 year old daughter.
1.0,Was printed crooked
1.0,Had to return because it had holes all in the outfit
1.0,This item is certainly not worth the money. It's not a toy a child can play with. It's very small -- more like a party favor that gets broken very quickly!
1.0,Didn’t like at all wish I could return
1.0,I had only worn this for one day and its started turning brown
1.0,Quality is like an old uses up shirt that you have washed 20 times. It looks worn out before you even wear it!
1.0,Nice watch band but oddly sized. Strap with buckle on it is considerably too short.
1.0,"I was really excited to get this, but when I received it the front pocket was ripped at the bottom and part of the clip was broke. Why mail customers products that are broken and in bad condition?"
1.0,These would be really cute but they arrived broken. The hook part was detached and warped on one of the earrings making it unwearable when I opened it.
1.0,"The shirt runs big and long and the skirt tight. The shirt is blue and red, not pink. The skirt is purple not blue."
1.0,The band would not slide into my watch
1.0,Wanted to love this but does not hold it's shape after one washing.  Basically a disposable garment.
1.0,Came with a dead battery
1.0,"I got the XXXL hoping it would be large enough for my 38G's....not even close! The black sides of the top do not add any more coverage. I was hanging out every side of the top! Unfortunately the bottom didn't fit well enough either...right size, but the bottom band sat low and awkward; it left a strange gap."
1.0,Too tight and the elastic is restrictive so hard to breathe.  Not comfortable yet I ordered correct size
1.0,"Pros:  Very nice looking watch-looks even better in person. Has a real nice heft to it, the band was solid and attractive. To size the band, you have to remove screws instead of the normal pins. That's a nice touch and for watch of this price point I think it's pretty amazing.<br /><br />Cons: the flip over latch on the band has  (in my opinion) a flawed design in that the retaining pin/hinge pin does not go all the through. Latch fell off while I was setting time, I fixed it and thought it was a fluke. Unfortunately pin and latch fell out again the next day and were lost. Second, the GMT function did not work. I set it for UTC, which for me is +5 hours this feature failed to work properly. Sadly I reached out to LIGE customer service and heard nothing back. Maybe it was a one time quality error. I don't know. if the company won't answer questions in the first few days, I am doubtful that they would guarantee their products. Beware."
1.0,Fit perfect but the zipper was on the side wouldn’t zip correctly. Also the fabric is cheap & the print does not look as nice as the picture.
1.0,I'm 5&#34;6 165 it fit like a baby onesie it was awful!!!
1.0,It was a very poor choice. The color is so faded. Organization was ok but the overall quality  of the purse is a 0. Trying to return it is a flippen nightmare. So it hangs in my closet. Returning it is a nightmare. Will never order anything else.
1.0,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, AWFUL,AWFUL, AWFUL. Don't buy from this company, it's not knitted, its nylon and short. They have no customer service or support and aren't helping at all. Don't waste your money"
1.0,"It doesn't look like the picture at all!!! The seams weren't sewn right, the straps were falling apart, the shirt was huge but the straps couldn't even fit. Everything about this order was not good. Save your money! I was really disappointed it looked so cute in the photo! The bottoms were WAY to big :("
1.0,Was supposed to be grey which was needed for an event but what was sent was more green than grey.
1.0,"Poor quilts, material used nothing like you see on the computer,very disapointed,how cheaply it was made."
1.0,Really not satisfy with this.
1.0,I ordered a M and a L. I got an XL and 2XL. Whatever. Don’t bother with this supplier. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Bought for my Disney pins and they just fall apart.  They do not stay on and do not tighten.  Very cheaply made also.  I would not recommend getting this product.
1.0,"Rubies look scuffed and dull, chipped in places. Pearls also look scuffed. Ruby color comes off when rubies are cleaned with gem cleaner. Packaging is overwhelmingly beautiful. Silk lined fabric envelope in sturdy jewelry box, unwrapping the necklace is an anticipatory act. Scuffs, chips, and dullness make the moment anti climatic."
1.0,cheaply made<br />not waterproof<br />poor quality<br />if i did not wear them i would have returned them<br /><br />VERY MISLEADING
1.0,the picture is clearly showing a purple pair of glasses.<br />I received BLUE.<br />adhering to AMAZON standards - this isn't what I ordered<br />and describing the product?<br />it was blue.  and small.<br />no returns !<br />returns not authorized nor is AMAZON A-Z claim allowed.<br />please check the seller first.<br />I can only imagine that the PURPLE is beautiful.<br />very familiar with this brand - I have many.<br />but very disappointed.
1.0,"they were no easy on easy off, never got past the foot area"
1.0,The necklace arrived broken and the birds were more like blobs of paint than birds.
1.0,I don't like the hat
1.0,BAAAD SIZING. Not as advertised. We gave the supposed size 16 away to a girl who wears a size 2 and they fit her pretty well. This is why I hesitate to buy clothing online. And I'm too lazy to return things.
1.0,The leather hang fell off. Well I could deal with that. Next the thing I know the cover on the front latch fell off today and it too late to return by 15 days. Really would like to return
1.0,Didn’t fit awful not worth it
1.0,"This was a horrible impulse buy.<br />It frayed the 2nd time I adjusted it (note: never actually wore aside from standing infront of the mirror).<br />It has no loop to hold while you cinch.<br />It is only 4.25 inches wide, despite what the ad days.<br />Due to the width issue, you have to overlap the wrap, almost 1/2 way covering each section - resulting in a much shorter than necessary product.<br />After many ""wtf"" moments, I gave up. I'd rather look like a flabby girl, than a blown out and shredded tire.<br />Thanks for nothing, including your complete lack of customer support."
1.0,Not that color. It’s safety pink. Not fuchsia at all
1.0,I bought these thinking they were the same as the ones I had bought at our grocery store but these are different (same brand and name) but the lid just pops off and the toddlers pull them off and make messes. These are counteractive to my goal of reducing waste as they are now in the trash.
1.0,"Nothing to do with the wallet I had previously bought, they are totally different, the leather, size and model are different, very disappointed!!!"
1.0,The quality is so cheap. 🙄
1.0,The first time I wore it the steel came out I'm totally upset
1.0,"Buyers beware!  So far I have not received a refund on this dress and it was returned within a timely manner.<br />These dresses run very small and come from China.  If I do not receive my refund soon, I will have to contact Amazon to see what I need to do to get my money back.  If all orders and returns were like this one, I would be very leery of ordering from Amazon."
1.0,Lights went out after 1 week on both shoes. My son ia very disappointed to say the least
1.0,"If I could give this a no star, I would. It was disappointing to find a hole in the armpit. And the material was cheap & too faded. I have one in khaki from another seller & it doesn't feel like this material."
1.0,very cheap construction. Broke when I took them out of the box and tried to put them on.
1.0,"Fabric is very thin. Pictures as gray and pink, but they are most definitely black, red and white."
1.0,This fit  horribly
1.0,Stones fell out within a few months
1.0,Boot looked a li
1.0,Watch stopped working after 10 months! Junk
1.0,At least 4 sizes too small. Get out the suspenders because this belt won't hold your pants up. I should have realized it was a Chinese product meant for people with little waists. Roger
1.0,"These are absolutely useless. Instead of bright white lights, th see just make them bright yellow. They don’t ease the brightness at all. Oncoming lights are still blinding."
1.0,Runs small. Beware when ordering. Seller will only refund 40% of cost. Not an expensive item but shame on me for not clicking on the return policy. I just assumed it would be refunded at 100% when ordering. I was wrong. I'll donate it to someone who will enjoy it.
1.0,"Would give 0 stars if I could!!! Sweater was not as pictured.  Thin material, falling apart, nothing like the description."
1.0,This is a stolen design! You will get a knockoff costume of terrible quality!!
1.0,"Love sweater fit and style.  But, material catches, unravels and snags badly with everything it comes in contact with. Disappointed"
1.0,Item is cheaply made. I would expect to pay less than 20 dollars for something of this quality.
1.0,"Was very depressed that this top did not fit. Because I didn't know how to return this item, which was sad, I have already given it away. Wish the return policy had been in the delivery!"
1.0,I normally wear L or 14. After reading the reviews I went with XL just to be safe. But I believe the XL fits a Small person not even Medium. The material is kind of like yoga pants but slightly thicker. It's too tight and everything pops out everywhere if you're curvy. I don't recommend this to people of my size.
1.0,"This is definitely, by no stretch of the imagination, a tshirt. It’s neither a sweatshirt, nor off the shoulder. It’s a long sleeved tshirt."
1.0,Not as pictured. Received plain black sunglasses
1.0,Very cheap material not what I thought it was going to look like. I have never worn this product because I was unhappy with the quality.
1.0,I bought a pair of these in January 2019 and they did not even last a year. The soles fell apart and cracked and big chunks of rubber or whatever it is made of is the worst. Do not waste your money on these.
1.0,Fit my 3 year old granddaughter. Very unhappy.
1.0,"The seam was open at the bottom when it arrived. I had to hand sew it closed,  then after a sink wash the whole seam separated from the fabric. Too bad, I loved the color. Amazon was great to accept return"
1.0,Muy pegado al cuerpo
1.0,I purchased the shorts to feel comfortable in dresses on hot days. These shorts are very uncomfortable. The fabric feels like it is made with brillo pads.
1.0,Was not off the shoulder
1.0,Picture of dress and what you get are very different and disappointing
1.0,"Really liked the fit and comfort, but the metal bracket that connects to fitbit randomly broke and the Fitbit fell off my wrist. I was sitting calmly when it happened. I'd been using it for three weeks and it had not taken any sort of damage, just seems defective."
1.0,Very thin not made for winter up northeast.
1.0,The frames are overall &#34;small&#34;. Lightweight in a way that  feel cheap. Returning.
1.0,"It is smaller than the size of a pinky finger nail. It would work if you are going to put it on earrings but nothing else.<br /><br />Also, to put a picture into here would be difficult because of the size. You might just be able to fit a person's eye in there but not much else.<br /><br />P.s. - No chain either."
1.0,Screw on<br />And would not work
1.0,"I'm 6-3 and the strap was too short, pockets too shoot to really carry anything. I just gave it to a girl that works at restaurant I frequent."
1.0,"I am so bummed out with this. I had been wanting one of these sweatshirts for a long time and finally got one. I was excited that it fit and I really loved. BUT unfortunately, literally within hours of wearing it, just sitting at work, two of the snaps fell off :( The only positive thing to say, is at least they had an easy return policy. Still so sad and disappointed about this."
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. I cannot imagine anyone buying this and keeping it. Fabric was literally falling apart and see through... just not good at all
1.0,I ordered and received these for my two sons. They did not hold together. I do not recommend for anyone!
1.0,Broke a day or two after we got it
1.0,It broke after a year! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,"Not happy with this purchase at all. The saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; could not be more true. Looks so cheap, was tangled when i took it out, definately will not be wearing this."
1.0,Bought these because they were lightweight and different colors but each one I used broke!  They are poorly made and do not hold up.  After the 4th one broke I tried to return them but my 30 days were up and now I am stuck with these useless eyeglass neck-straps.
1.0,"I bought a 3X and couldn’t get it over my head. My 12 year old, skinny granddaughter barely got it on. And it doesn’t even look like the picture. Nor is it the same material. It’s cut straight on all sides. I’ll never buy anything from China again. And Amazon needs to stop selling disappointing products. And it took forever to get here. What a waste of money. I’m so pissed."
1.0,"This review is for the sanitary issue of the product. The shirt itself is very cute, but the first one we ordered has yellow stains all over the back side. We returned it and order a different size thinking maybe we are just unlucky and got a return item. The second shipment came. We can't believe our eyes. A yellow stain right on the center of the back side that makes you wonder where these clothes have been. It feels really gross, but we decided to keep it. Luckily, some oxy clean took care of it. Refund was prompt for the first order which is another plus."
1.0,fell apart after one day of wearing it
1.0,This earring arrived smashed
1.0,Love the style but quality is poor & see through
1.0,This is a piece of crap not worth 10 dollars do not buy from here cheapskates
1.0,The sizing on these products is very misleading- I'm a size 12 and while I could get this on- I could not move in it.
1.0,"Not What I Expected, Cheaply Made!<br />Looks NOTHING Like The Picture.<br />😝"
1.0,"Mine came defective and damaged, and I was extremely disappointed.<br />The black color was beautiful and the fur was extremely soft - this was the only good thing<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that it was lopsided. No matter how hard I tried to reshape it, it was lopsided.<br />It was not shaped like a ball.<br />Second thing was the keychain was horrific. It was sticky and completely not in good shape (look at pic)<br />Finally, I told myself to just take it off the key chain, try to reshape the fur ball, and place it on one of my other keychains.<br />But then I noticed the rip. Maybe that's why it's lopsided. But you can see the stuffing on the inside.<br />There was no way I could make this work.<br /><br />Also, I order quite a few of a fur ball key chains for my purses (spent 1-2$ on each), and sometimes they come from china, but still in perfect condition. I assumed that since I could use prime that it would come in perfect condition, but I was wrong. I typically use reviews to avoid getting damaged products especially for these, but unfortunately I got one.<br /><br />So, no I do NOT think this is worth 9.99, yes you can get prime shipping, but I've gotten better quality for 2$ coming from china with shipping that takes forever (3 weeks).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br />Update: Amazon let me return the product since it was unusable."
1.0,"Sweater is beautiful, the perfect color purple That I needed for my event. Once I took the sweater out of the package it looked like someone had already wore it! There were food remnants on the front… Looked like smashed crackers and cheese.  And then the left sleeve was completely ripped from elbow to wrist! There were fuzzies all over it along with some sort of animal hair..... WTH???"
1.0,The product is too large
1.0,"Update: This mask is TERRIBLE!!! It's like wearing a thick, window CURTAIN on your face. Plus, the ""stitching"" & sewing is OFF. The mask itself is sewn in the wrong places & you can't make out the picture image too well because of how it's stitched.<br />I gave the mask to a friend."
1.0,"They looked ok, semi-stylish, although a tad wide. When I first was using them, I was getting dizzy, but that's because the polarized lenses were at different angles. Apparently not aligned at the factory. Once I spun the glass a half turn or so, the polarization lined up and it was good. Three weeks later, the weld to the side of the temple just fell off, so I'd say the build quality isn't there. I may have used these 3 times."
1.0,Great dress just didn’t fit my figure
1.0,Bad quality. It broke on the second day. The plastic is very roasted.
1.0,The top cuts into your leg. I got other brands that are the same size. Go2 was the only one that did that
1.0,terrible quality feels like paper
1.0,How do I exchange for a larger size?
1.0,Material loses its quality after 2-3 washes and becomes sticky. Not worth buying
1.0,The instructions in the box do not match the watch. I have emailed the company with no response. In order to get instructions downloaded you have to submit a credit card to an independent site. They finally sent me a link for a video. I will give it one more try before I give up & return the watch.
1.0,Not good for driving
1.0,If you're tall this is NOT for you !
1.0,I ordered survival  but it's  not survival no sticker nothing. bad quality  it's copy  but quality  is poor I know  that  company  I have other  pants
1.0,"Nice sweater, very cute.  Not made well.  Arm seam is stretched out at seam and thread from sweater unraveled first day I wore.  Has nothing to do with sizing.  True to fit.  Will not purchase again."
1.0,"Tried it on and never wore it again. Sleeves don’t fit right like in the picture, some are right some are loose. Doesn’t look good. Kinda small."
1.0,Bottle came practically empty still a good product just disappointed with the lack of care with the shipping
1.0,The worst quality I’ve seen on Amazon yet! Do not buy this. It basically fell apart and is made from a raincoat material.
1.0,"What out there sizes are no way correct, I am a USA gal and a 2X here is almost to big, and the 2X from China is WAY TO SMALL"
1.0,This is not a henley this is a sleeveless very thin top. I returned.
1.0,"or really any of the things you look for in a slipper, other than coverin' ur feet."
1.0,didn't fit in the chest/no support
1.0,The large talls I ordered were just large .... clearly labeled differently than the drop down box that indicated tall.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that you DO NOT ORDER these as the sizes ordered will be WRONG.
1.0,The the stud was fine the back was flat would not even go on the stem like a smashed pc of metal
1.0,Do not buy this watch. I bought one and it came in a very bent up casing. The watch stopped working in two weeks and I am left without my money.
1.0,"Whatever metal is being used isn’t good quality. Caused a reaction soon as I put it on my neck. Plus, I ordered 3 sets and only received the necklaces. There were no bracelets in any of the little bags. I do not recommend"
1.0,"cheap, cheap, does NOT LOOK anything like the photo. Too embarrassed to give as a gift to a 10 year old. I'll have to donate it to good will."
1.0,Came dirty. Cup pads are ridiculous. Would not have been able to wear the bra with the cups attached. Without the cups there is no support and very thin almost see through.
1.0,"The description says ""no wiring"" but there are wired bands on the sides, underneath the armpits. The wired bands are bulky, stiff and uncomfortable. Also, the bra runs small. Returning immediately."
1.0,The shorts have no tummy control at all. The material is very flimsy and see through. They’re just way too flimsy for yoga shorts!
1.0,Llego el producto dañado. El resorte no funciona y lamentablemente me di cuenta tarde.
1.0,Very hard to close and cheap feeling. Almost look fake
1.0,Very cute bracelet but very cheaply made. My daughter (age 9) only wore it once before it fell apart.
1.0,"The two zippers have so much material around them that they inevitably get stuck. It's impossible to move them without ruining the case. Very poor design. I would not recommend this product. If only they had moved the material away from the zippers, the product would work."
1.0,Very small at the hip area
1.0,turned my finger green it’s pretty but it will turn u green
1.0,Terrible.  Fell apart in less than a month.  Very uncomfortable and rough surface so it hurt to walk towards the end of my 10 hour shift.  Do not buy if you regularly walk more than 10000 steps a day.
1.0,"Fabric is soft and comfortable.  Waist sized to fit as other shorts I have and is fine.  Other dimensions in the thighs and seat are tight and uncomfortable.  If I never sit down while wearing these shorts they look and feel fine, but no one wants that except maybe a male model with only a required standing pose.  I guess the manufacturer chose a unique percentile man on the human factors chart to justify their less-than-roomy design and cut costs on fabric.  I plan to use the shorts as a car wash cloth, since wearing them as pajama shorts is out-of-the-question."
1.0,not for me want to return.
1.0,Very uncomfortable! Do not buy !
1.0,Muy pequeño ami niña no le quedo😞😞😞
1.0,Highly upset. Everything was perfect & wanted to love it but it SMELLED LIKE FISH. I had it air out next to the window for 24 hours thinking it would go away & it didn't
1.0,Masks are all different sizes it does not have the internal fabric items missing not even close to item descriptions
1.0,This belt broke on the first day I wore it.  The spring came out and the buckle latch came off.  Very disappointed with the quality.
1.0,"Bad quality, lights no longer works, last for 2 days only"
1.0,So I ordered the black hat an the one that came is navy blue.  My biggest pet peeve is ordering something an getting the wrong color (cuz I'm already unsure how the hat is going to fit me so the last thing I need to worry about is the color... however it fit me kinda nice even though I have dreads so that's a plus but one star because I really wanted the black one NOT NAVY BLUE
1.0,They don't wrap like they do in the picture. Made of steel.
1.0,"Originally, my wife and I really liked Ravean products. Over the past two years, we have each owned their jackets, gloves, and hand warmers. However, all of these products have proven to be faulty, and we end up having to have them replaced under warranty. The problem is, they keep failing the same way, and now the warranties are expiring so we have no recourse. We've spent a LOT of money on these things, only to end up with broken items that Ravean does NOT repair (they do not have a repair facility at all). So, all-in-all, a total waste of money."
1.0,Received a wish item for this purchase.
1.0,I bought this primarily for the nose piece.  unfortunately these did not fit my M frames.  I have the original frame and lens sets and the nose piece was to narrow for the lenses.
1.0,Too small for the large size ordered
1.0,Thais jacket runs much too small!
1.0,"Terrible quality, feels like paper."
1.0,"So the face mask itself is actually not a bad face mask. I like the dual layers of it that provide a little extra protection. The mask is nicely sewn and really well made. I like that the ear loops can be adjusted to provide a proper fit.<br /><br />You have a little clip in the nose to make the mask fit even better yet. I also like that around the cheeks and under the eyes the mask lowers and prevents the mask therefor from constantly riding up into your eyes like most other masks do. They have some really cute designs which is also nice. I got a size L which fits me perfectly.<br /><br />What I do have a a serious problem with however, is when I order a black bandana and they send me the green cameo design. I will not wear that one at all so now this is a useless mask to me. WHY did they decide to send me a mask design that I did not request? Seriously? How can they just substitute what the customer requested? Well for that I will give them the stars that I am since for actions there are consequences."
1.0,Mask is cute. It is too big and you can't breathe through the material
1.0,No thanks!
1.0,The hat was shipped in a plastic bag and all smashed up and wrinkled. Haven’t tried steaming it but I shouldn’t have to reshape a hat when it was bought brand new.
1.0,I dont like the fact that I received my item damage
1.0,Cheap I get it was not a lot of money but it was of poor quality all the way around!  And every one had this cheap hat!
1.0,Ear warmers are very thin. But will work in a pinch.
1.0,Ok so I sized up 2 sizes to XL and it’s way too small. I couldn’t even get it on never mind have it fit loos like the picture. Then I washed it just to see what would happen and it shrunk. It literally fits a small 4 year old. It also took forever to arrive. Other than that though it would have been cute. UPDATED: I ordered 2 more sizes up now at an XXXL. It fits like a normal fitted shirt and is not baggy at all like the picture.
1.0,I thought the would be good socks but they are not. The coloring on the darks colors fade after the first wash. The white does not get completely white after washing I do not care how much bleach you use. I still have the socks but I do not use them and  I have not purchased this item again. Oh and they do not stay up they fall down very easily.
1.0,the material is terrible.  Feel like little balls on the inside even after washing .
1.0,"It keeps breaking, the two purple tassels has come off and the clasp has come off the chain, I keep have to constantly fix it. Very disappointed in this one."
1.0,"My daughter bought this with her Christmas money and was so excited to get it. After a month or so it finally came and the chain broke as we took it out of the package, I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,NOT Cotton.
1.0,"Only worked for a month and a half. Charged two times. On the third charge, wires got really hot and I unplugged them right away. One shoe no longer works. Of course,  too late to return.  Don't buy. She only wore them maybe ten times. Ripoff!"
1.0,They small looks like for kids only and look cheap
1.0,Nice colors but the material is not as pictures or described. Returned.
1.0,"We wonder what all the raving reviews were about.  The strap cannot be fastened tightly and when you dive into the water it comes right off, and water gets into our child’s eyes, defeating the purposes of wearing goggles.  We are returning ours."
1.0,"I didn't expect much from a pair of sunglasses that were 7.99, but I at least expected the SECOND PAIR to not arrive broken. I let the first pair slide, and didn't place a negative review, but this is ridiculous. The last pair was missing a screw, so the lens just flopped around, and now this pair the screw was too tight so cracked the lens. I guess third times a charm? We will see. I have sensitive eyes and have to wear sunglasses at all times during daylight so maybe the next pair will be up to par."
1.0,"The bracelet is pretty, but unfortunately it broke right away. The area next to each side of the bows is thin and breaks easily. Also, the little stones on the ends fall off."
1.0,"misleading , the  picture clearly shows a adult apron and a child apron . There is also size dimensions for both aprons also BUT I only received the child’s apron ."
1.0,IT'S NOT LEATHER....it is my fault for buying this wallet. I should have known that a leather wallet would have been more expensive!
1.0,Very thin and not true to size. I returned.
1.0,MAde in China
1.0,"I ordered this dress in royal blue and the material is so incredibly thin that the entire dress is see through. The particular dress I received had white deodorant marks on it so I’m assuming it was already returned at least once. Would not recommend, will be returning!"
1.0,Cheap fabric and poorly made.
1.0,"They were very cheap. 2 of the chains broke in the first 2 days, then the wiring around the pendants is thin and loose. A pendant fell out of the wiring on the second day as well. I am returning these and trying to buy some from a different company. Not worth the price for a necklace that doesn't even last a day..."
1.0,Demasiado pequeño y no brindan comodidad
1.0,No era lo que pedimos el material del vestido es de mala calidad
1.0,"I bought the white lace one in XL. The edges of the lace aren't even hemmed and the pieces of fabric don't line up and are about half an inch off. The arm holes and space between the arms on the back are extremely small, it's tight and wouldn't fit like it does in the picture unless you are a US size small and order the XL. Definitely the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon."
1.0,"2 out of 3 broke within a week,"
1.0,Weird stretchy material.
1.0,Dress was too small. Dress material looked and felt cheap.
1.0,The screw falls out all the time and I have gone through all of them in less then a week. Wouldnt recomend them.
1.0,This dress was soild and I sent it back. I didnt like is at all.
1.0,"They looked so cute on but the first time I wore them, one of the jewels fell off within the first 20 minutes. They are just stuck on with some sticky substance that doesn’t work. Very sad, I thought they would work"
1.0,Looked very cheesy nothing like the picture 👎🏽
1.0,"This mask is HUGE. If othet masks are massively too small for you, this is your mask. I was so disappointed."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this luggage but after my first trip, I was so let down. Several of the zippers split right away and my suitcase wasn't stuffed by any means. It is also heavy. I have a larger piece than the one in this set, can stuff it full as possible, and it still isn't over the weight limit for the airlines...I didn't have this one full at all and it was overweight so I had to pay $75! Lastly, one of the straps inside the small suitcase ripped right off, like it was barely sewn in to begin with. I would return this set if I was able to, but it has been used once, so no luck on my part ugh!"
1.0,Small fit... extra stiff material with a very odd cut going up...
1.0,It has now been 4 months in the sun and it is almost WHITE.  I have written a review before but it does not show up.  I trust Amazon What happen with my views on this product?  I would tell everyone not to buy this product.
1.0,"it sucked , didnt fit , and cheap as hell !!!!  DO NOT BUY !!!1"
1.0,"These earrings are cheap looking and they look silver in picture, not gold..sorta pretty and then not..don't like em.."
1.0,I almost lost my Apple Watch because this band broke. My watch fell off of me while I was at the airport and I spent the next 20 minutes frantically looking for it. Worst purchase ever!!!!!!
1.0,Glasses arrived in a damaged state
1.0,"This was a big disappointment. It is “slick” so my foot slides around and the back of my shoe folds down. It does not stay on my heel, thus isn’t helpful at all.<br />I have rheumatoid arthritis and getting my shoes on every morning with stiff painful hands and feet is a challenge.<br />Don’t waste your time on this one."
1.0,"The zipper was broke on mine, but got it on eventually. There is no support at all. Not for foot arch, or the ankle. Take a flip flop bottom, and with one row or string tie it around the arch of your foot. Take another single row of string around the back heel of the flip flop around the front of your ankle/top of foot. Both strings ties loosely. You now have the same support as these shoes"
1.0,"Not a fan. I returned this item due to it being too small. NOT ""true to size"", and when I went to reorder a larger size, the price went up $10+. No thanks."
1.0,"Bad cut , too small"
1.0,Poor quality too
1.0,"Could not believe how small and tight and did not like material. Sorry but not my style, not for me.  Would never buy again. They must be made for very small thin women."
1.0,"I cannot begin to describe how livid I am! The picture above is after 3 days of wear! I have always bought $15 shoes and they last about 4 months. So I thought that if I spent more money on shoes (with outstanding reviews) that they would be off better quality and last longer. I have a 4 year old that is rough on his shoes and plays hard, but seriously?!?! We got them on Sunday and he started wearing them on Monday, today is Wednesday. So now I'm out $30 on shoes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I would rate this a 0, because 1 is much too high."
1.0,"Updated 9/14/2018.<br />When these arrived they looked good but I noticed they only had design on one side and within 3 washes have lost alot of their print. .  The big drawback is that the design is printed on, it feels really cheap as if there is a thin layer of plastic where the print is and by the 3rd wash 40% of the design, which is only on one side, wore off.  See picture of this bandanna which is the navy blue one on the left, verses a quality bandanna, the black one which is on the right.  The black one has the design dyed in or something so it carries through to both sides and can never wash off.  All that said, the size is good.  I wear 7 & 1/4  hats and so the normal size bandannas do not fit my head these larger 27&#34; size bandannas fit perfectly around my big grape  with room to spare"
1.0,Nothing like the pic.
1.0,So short! Very disappointed!
1.0,Product was great when received. But by the end of the week the design was flaking off the original white band. The color was faded and no design is left.
1.0,i bought this to go with my prom dress so when it came in i went straight to my piercer. come to find out the bar is too small and wouldn't even go all the way through my cartilage
1.0,These run VERY small.
1.0,"The hinge is very difficult to open, and the ring is much smaller than what the images suggested. Too snug of a fit, and extremely difficult to close the hinge once it’s in your nose. Won’t buy these products again"
1.0,"This jewelry set is extremely crappy and cheap. I wore it to a wedding and it turned my neck green. Also, when I received it, the earring backs were bent in, and I had to straighten them with pliers."
1.0,"came scratched and basically falling apart, the material inside was pealing from the leather"
1.0,"Looks nice but the minute my son put it on,it broke.The pin holding the bracelet strap snapped off.I brought it to be fixed and was told not to bother replacing the pin.This watch looks nice but is extremely poorly made."
1.0,"The pockets came up to my waist, not hip level and you can’t comfortably put your hands in the pockets. ALSO. This dress felt like newspaper. You truly get what you pay for at $10."
1.0,"It is cheaply made and an ugly white underneath. So, it would only work with a white bag since that is mainly what shows. Not worth $2, much less $14!"
1.0,Just junk - but what did I expect for the price?
1.0,Awful! Ripped on the second day!
1.0,Comes in to big
1.0,Chain came with tight knot in it. Afraid to wear it may lose my Fitbit. Not worth it😠
1.0,"Crotch is way low, can't kick above mid thigh level. Washed them hoping shrinkage would take care of issue, but no. Past return window, have no use for these."
1.0,Fits way too small on an adult. Actual necklace size looks nothing like what’s pictured
1.0,It is much to large can't use it Waste of money
1.0,The circular rhinestone part came right off of the ring. I don’t know if it wasn’t welded on good enough but not worth the money!!
1.0,they didn’t look real and i can’t wear the top one bc it don’t fit.
1.0,"wanted soft silicone, these are hard plastic, one broke right off the bat. never used them . dont waste your money. Doc"
1.0,I absolutely loved this band but now 2 days outside the return time my wrist is green! i will not wear it ever agaiin. i am so disappointed!
1.0,That was fine
1.0,The material it too thin! You can see your bra through it and it's BIG. It doesn't quite look like the sales photo the dimensions are wrong. Very unflattering.
1.0,This item does not mold to the body.  The bottoms are exactly the same size in the front as in the back. Looks baggy and dumpy in the The front and too small in the back. The silky fabric doesn't even have a hope of staying over a bottom.  There is no way the model in this picture is wearing this suit.
1.0,Not happy with this product at all. It should have been big on my daughter.  But it doesn't come close to fitting.
1.0,Ordered the XXL that fits like a large. Not happy.
1.0,"These are NOT linen!! They are some sort of plastic(think outdoor picnick table,table cloth) it arrived with small burn holes in them and looks like they were haf sewn half GLUED together! I know this because they were badly glued on those arts and coming undone!This was a serious scam of selling goods I have ever seen!BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,"This is NOT the same as the picture. The material is different, there are no drawstrings, and it’s flat out cheap looking and feeling. Do not order this. You’ll wait two months only to be disappointed."
1.0,Dis not grip??
1.0,Duró mucho tiempo en llegar y cuando me llegó no me quedo ....
1.0,"Not even a little waterproof. Water soaks right through.<br /><br />Look elsewhere if you're looking for a ""rain jacket""."
1.0,"Smelled funny, very cheap fabric. Returned this."
1.0,"These are adorable and fit true to size but are not genuine leather. PU leather=fake leather. It is made by taking leftover bits of fibrous cowhide and sticking them together with a polyurethane adhesive.  Yeah, there's leather in it, but it's NOT the real deal and will crack and peel with use.  Buyer beware.<br />I received these as a gift from hubby,  who was deceived by the &#34;P U LEATHER&#34; claim. They are cute boots, true to size, and will work as a costume or for occasional wear. Not recommended if you hope to wear these for many seadons. I sent these back. You can definitely find cute boots in genuine leather elsewhere at this price!"
1.0,the pants are just a few yards of fabric.  The dress is un sewn along the arms and sides of the dress and the neck is also unstitched.  The arms are sooooo thin it isn't even worth sewing up the sides at the point.  the armhole and arms are extremely thin that an average persons arms would not fit in them.  if you purchase this to make it a sleeveless dress and can sew up the pants yourself from scratch then this is a good value
1.0,When I opened the box last night. The box was full of roaches. 👺👺👺👺👺👺I am so angry.  I opened the box on my bed and roaches ran every where.
1.0,Not as nice as is pictured. Floppy latex mask that looked like beast got hit in the face with a shovel. Ill fitting and could not see out of the eye holes. Returned it.
1.0,"This is a horrible watch. The leather is stiff. It is so stiff that it is difficult to put on. Needless to say, I returned it. I would not recommend this watch fo anyone!!!"
1.0,Missing oarts
1.0,Cheaply made Asian knockoff. Threads coming undone. Much too tight. Ordered one size up and it was still child’s size.
1.0,Frames bend easily. Lenses pop out when cleaning. Rubber grips on frame fall off. And now the screws keep falling out. Barely 3 months old. Would not recommend.
1.0,It damaged just after couple laundry.
1.0,Poor quality!! I’m a size medium and I need one asap and the only available size available was the XL. When I got it it was to small and it ripped on day two. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,I ordered a XXL but received large which I couldn't wear. I was very disappointed.
1.0,"I have had this belt for less than a year and is already falling apart. Spend a little more money on something that will last, this is a very poor quality belt."
1.0,Dont look goid on anything very dissapointed
1.0,NOT linen. 100% polyester. Way too small. I ordered an XL and gave them to a friend that weighs 102 pounds. They fit her.  The seller tried to rip me off by not offering a refund. Then they offered 20% refund.. when I refused and demanded 100% refund for the ‘linen’ pants they came back with a 30% then an 80% offer.
1.0,Immediately Broke. Very dissapointed with this product. Didn't even get to use it for a full night!
1.0,"This robe looked great in Christmas morning when my daughter opened it. She didn't actually put it on and wear it until a few days ago. I went to give her a hug and felt hard patches on the robe where areas of the robe seem fused together creating hard, lumpy patches all over it."
1.0,"Too tight, stiff & scratchy"
1.0,Odd Seam half way down the shirt
1.0,I double checked to make sure before I purchased this dress because it needs to be long as seen on model. Model is 5'10 according to advertisement but I'm only 5'8 and it was just below my knees. HORRIBLE.... I will be returning!! Thank God I had a backup plan!!!
1.0,I did not liked the material
1.0,Yuck! Bad dress! Poorly constructed and design is awful and fabric is not so hot either. This is a bad dress.
1.0,Ordered a large it looks and feel like an xs  I had to send it back
1.0,The collar was not sewn in like it looks.  Only tacked on if a few places.  Had to make sure the whole collar was tucked inside the sweatshirt when putting it on.
1.0,The quality and material of this pants sucks.  Dont buy this.
1.0,Just don't buy it you will thank me later
1.0,"Too big. Cheap, shiny fabric, can’t see the pattern bc 1. The colors are too close, not enough contrast. And 2. The shine of the fabric is so reflective you can’t tell it has a pattern. This dress was so cheap looking and without being able to see the Dinos- it’s not worth the money, so I returned it."
1.0,Did not like the quality of the material. Not worth the money.
1.0,It's very poor quality and flimsy. Obviously I knew the hat would be smashed during shipping but due to how much it was smashed and the flimsyness of it there is no way to form it to shape. I don't recommend this product at all.
1.0,"The necklaces arrived within the stated timeframe. Packaging was less than ideal and the necklaces were intertwined. Both the chain and the charm appear cheaply made and I do not foresee either lasting long. The phrase &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; is applicable. If you're looking for a cheap (kid-like) necklace then great. If you're wanting a necklace that will last, I strongly recommend putting your money toward another. The size of the charm is also larger than I expected, although I didn't review the dimensions prior to ordering so that is my fault. All in all, it's a cheap necklace that my daughter and I can wear until the nicer, slightly more costly one arrives."
1.0,The stitching comes apart
1.0,It's too yellow  and very smaller than pic it look chunky on picture now in person don't like it need my money back
1.0,I like the outside look of the purse but the inside is cheaply made and tore easily. I would not buy this product again
1.0,Money clip broke right away
1.0,Material and quality are low end... I should have known because of the low price. Came from China
1.0,Looks good but the long strap for over the shoulder broke on the first day!!  The handle is too short to carry  over the shoulder so I would not recommend this purse.
1.0,The plate was smaller than expected. The chain was too small. The plate had scratches on it when I received it.
1.0,"Size is not right, small for the size listed"
1.0,"Cute,  but screws got loose and fell out.  I bought a 2nd pair,  but same thing."
1.0,Received a black one not silver.  And it was too close to my daughters wedding to exchange
1.0,This product looked good at first. But after about two months the black has started to come off. I do not work with any kind of heavy machinery or tools. It is simply from rubbing up against things like door handles or other everyday metal that everyone comes into contact with. Unfortunately I waited just too long to try and return it. $100 down the drain. I do not recommend buying this product. I wouldn’t have bought it for $20 if I had knew that it would get this bad this quick.
1.0,Received the product. Already broken into pieces.
1.0,I ordered the wine colored dress. It was not the same as the pic. Way to big in the breast area. And super super long.
1.0,these fit very strangely--- i ordered the smallest size--- one of the shoulder pads seemed to fit correctly.. the other one seemed to be mis-shapen (perhaps even slightly larger?). it's annoying to attach to your bra and it doesn't stay in place the way i expected it to. i've never worn these out of the house.
1.0,looks like a long t shirt
1.0,Does not stay up. Inferior product.<br />Purchase the stockings  sold here for $19.99<br />Worth the price.
1.0,Unless you are a size 6 or smaller don't waste your money. Not worth returning since it came from China
1.0,This dress was s lil ti buljy and stiff to my liking. I did not like the shape of it.  It looks really cheap.
1.0,Very cheap! The inside ripped as soon as I tried to put a credit card in it!
1.0,"It's supposed to be comfortable, but it feels to be just the opposite. The trunks I got from Walmart 5 years ago are still more comfortable than these brand new ones. Not to mention, I understand there will be a size difference, but these felt like a large when they were labeled as a XXXL. Also, it is clear that they were designed for a 38&#34; slim waist, not a 38&#34; husky waist. so unless you are a tall twig, don't get these trunks."
1.0,"Very cheap material, returned this right away."
1.0,I had to exchange this for a larger size as it was smaller than I expected. The Montana on the arm was printed incorrectly with the a by the shoulder and m down at the wrist. I would not purchase it again.
1.0,"Dear Amazon...I did start a return but then later realized the cathartic value of this item...I joyfully ate the $25.00 and smashed it against a corner of my desk...it was worth waaaay more than the worthless so called watch...the item itself could not  wind, it would just sit their dead on a wrist...but as a target dummy it was worth every penny...the glass exploded and powdered, just like a POS should...I don not encourage buying this product, and I do encourage shuttering the grabage brand...but it provided about 2.5 seconds of joy...true cathartic joy."
1.0,"This rhing was wrong from the moment I opened the packaging. I ordered pink, I received RED. Not maybe pink, true RED... ill-fitting, awkwardly short, extremely tight in the bust. Gave  it to a friend, a short, flat-chested friend..."
1.0,"The description said it was leather wrapped, it was but with cheap painted leather. The leather was really stiff and didn't bent much and was really hard, I would have liked to see a quality peice of leather attached, then maybe I would have kept it. Overall it was just poor quality."
1.0,"This purse is not at all like the picture.  It has a brown strap, brown piping and a beige bow.  And the top stitching on the pink is in squares, not hearts.  The one I wanted has black piping and a black bow.  I am returning it.  I hope I get back the extra shipping I paid to get it in one day.  Very disappointing."
1.0,The charms are very light like aluminum foil. I've purchased other charms and they didn't feel like this.  Will most likely not purchase again. And as you can see in the pictures I received only two #7 but I got 18 #6. I ordered 100 numbers and 0-4 were disbursed okay but the greater numbers not so much.  Oh and one #5 came broken.
1.0,This a stretching material this dress gives a box shape not flattering at all and too short to be a dress ...arms of dress are irregular also..
1.0,Very ugly and size doesnt fit at all . Comes from china so not worth returning.. and took for ever to arrive
1.0,love the material. ordered a XL but it sits more like a small.
1.0,The shoes received was of poor quality...loose threads were all over the shoes as if it was not finished.....very very disappointed because although the shoes fits the finished product looks tacky and doesnt look like something I wud let my son wear....
1.0,Fit very funny. The cups were too close together so I was popping out of the sides
1.0,"Very poorly made, looks nothing like the pictures!  I was super excited for these and when I put them on the stitching to attach each color is a huge flappy section and is irritating and feels horrible rubbing against my skin."
1.0,The bust measurements in the product description do not seem to be correct. Are these measurements in inches?
1.0,"This chain felt cheap and the weld looked odd, so I ordered a second to compare. Both were the same so for the price I kept both in case one broke. 3 weeks later the first broke. Then another 2 weeks later the second one broke. Believe it or not it wasn’t even the weld that failed it was the chain itself. It is not sterling silver as stated! It’s some cheap nonsense… as the price compared to other would indicate. As we all know but hold out hope… if something seems too good to be true it probably is… spend the extra money and save a headache!"
1.0,I went to open the clasp just to try the necklace on and I wasn’t even able to try it on because it broke as soon as I opened up the clasp it just fell apart. Cute necklaces but poorly made.
1.0,"I ordered an x-large because I heard it runs small, it looks like it is for a child, not an adult.  Plus it took forever to get, over a month! Now I will be returning it."
1.0,"Só e already came broken.. the rest gave me a strange pinching sensation when I wore them. I don't know what materials they use, but my skin didn't like it. Had to return ."
1.0,The metal piece came loose from the Rubber Holder and I lost my Go-tcha. Do not recommend purchasing this item.
1.0,"This isn't as flexible as the original. It will NOT fit correctly,it leaves a gap even though it has been screwed in and put together correctly. Completely a waste of money.I only have a one star because it made me choose one. Fyi,i never leave a bad review unless my purchase was absolutely horrible."
1.0,Unless you're a very small 12 year old girl don't waste your money.
1.0,The material was very thin and it runs small
1.0,bad product i don't recommend
1.0,i did not care for the fabric
1.0,I like the belt but it was way to big.  order same size as my other belts and this one was 6 inches to long.  Could even use the last hole in the belt. and cant return it now.
1.0,"Don't go here.  Looks like a nice watch but broken within a month, both the buckle and the second hand no longer turns.  My 8 year old worse rarely.  No out of window for return."
1.0,I normally don't leave reviews but feel obligated to warn people of the product they are receiving. I am attending a tie dye themed party so I ordered the tie dye dress. It is not a dress and yes I ordered it in my size. I may be able to wear it as a shirt but it is awkward as such so I doubt it. I will most likely order something else and hope it makes it in on time. The colors are nice but they are not as represented in the pictures. It is less traditional tie dye and more like the way the back is represented in the above photos. I don't suggest this product at all and am very disappointed in what received.
1.0,The material is cheap and sheds. The sizing is about 2sizes smaller than the listed sizing. I would definitely not order again.
1.0,"Lace is pretty, but too delicate to use for footliners. Didn't last 20 minutes. Needs solid sole and reinforcement in toes."
1.0,"These are dyed stones. The dye comes off on your hand when you hold them. Not only are the dyed, they're poorly dyed. 🙄"
1.0,Not even close to the photo shown. Careful what you order
1.0,"Ordered two shirts , money was deducted from my card but y'all never shipped my shirts. This is my favorite band too"
1.0,These came with scuffs/scratches on them.  I looked at them close the next day and there were significant cracks in the frame. They look cool but are of very low quality.
1.0,"I placed a very small light weight medallion about the size of a dime on the necklace and withing ten minutes of wearing it, the medallion went flying across the room. Not worth the effort to return which I suspect the company counts on."
1.0,"Turned colors after a week. My expectation wasn't too high given what it was for the quality and price, but I was expecting to wear it a little longer until I bought the real gold necklace that I wanted."
1.0,"This dress size medium (blk) did not fit my daughter who is a size 10 upper chest. The sleves were tight & the left side seemed to be totally dispaportioned ?. But the bottom of the dress fit and looked perfect. I'm afraid the large would be too big on her. So dont be discouraged because everyone is shaped different. So nice Price, Good fabric, just not for us."
1.0,Horrible what's so small could fit right through the ear
1.0,I took one size bigger that my daughter's actual size and it is too small. She wears a size 11 and I took a size 12 and it does not fit.
1.0,"They did not stay in place and did not cover me well. I am a larger woman, they may fit a small woman better. The material is too thin to keep a big girl like me covered."
1.0,The large chain immediately broke but my husband rigged it to clasp again. Then it broke again. It’s too heavy for the chintzy clasp and tiny fastening chain.
1.0,"this is a scam. the sweater looks like the thneed, from the lorax, except for no one needs this."
1.0,The head on this cleaners parts keep coming apart.  Bough this in June requested a replacement of refund  and no one seems to respond
1.0,Awful. Clips to connect to mask are too small and very poor quality. One broke immediately. Another broke after three uses.
1.0,"It is a beautiful watch at a very<br />low price.  When I got it I put<br />it on and it ran for less than 15<br />minutes and that was it...dead.<br />I did not follow up, feeling that<br />the time involved in the follow up<br />was not worth it."
1.0,"When I contacted the seller, photos were requested.  How do you photograph the missing rubber inside of an earring back encased in the cats back and legs.  I understand that people sometimes post poor reviews to get free items or the money back, this was not the case.  The item was defective and I was unhappy to wait 3 weeks for something that I could not use.  Maybe they should check items before they are sent."
1.0,"The hat itself is very cute and I was excited when it arrived.  However, the way the hat is made, there is no depth inside to fit over a baby's head. The circumference was perfect, but the depth of the hat (maybe an inch or so) prevented it from staying on.  It merely laid flat on top of my son's head like a pancake and kept falling off with no way to keep it in place.  It was a complete waste of money."
1.0,They did not stay on the hens at all.  Cute but will not do the job.
1.0,See through material and itchy . Very uncomfortable
1.0,This bra is a nursing bra.
1.0,"Dress has a terrible shape and awkward fit.<br />The cinched part was barely below my chest. It is also extremely short, would have to wear leggings with it. I am returning."
1.0,I'm very disappointed with this product as it has its advertisement wrong. When you see the title of the product it says three-piece when I got home to find my package in the mail it came with one piece had I realized that it was one piece for the amount of money I would not have brought it.
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl, these were maybe infant sized 2xl?"
1.0,Washed under the sink with a sponge and all the reflective shield peeled off. Wouldn’t buy these
1.0,Doesn't fit a human face. What a useless piece of trash. I am so disappointed.
1.0,These look nothing like advertised! They are HUGE and gaudy the colors are wild like neon orange and purple. These are so tacky.
1.0,I ordered 300 silver pcs as advertised. The color and amount was not what I paid for. The quality is fine so I give a star for that but I’m disappointed
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,I love Birkenstock but the rivet apart on the first and cut my toes. Had to return them
1.0,Got two pairs. One broke immediately and the other pair broke after 1 week. Would not recommend.
1.0,"This was a nice cover up, size as expected however, once I washed it, it shrunk so short I couldn’t even wear it as a shirt!"
1.0,"CHEAP, & turned after a couple of wears"
1.0,Tarnished and cheaply made. Not worth buying it
1.0,"I am a big guy, I wear a 3xl.  I ordered a 4xl because I was afraid of an all too common undersized cut.  The shirt was a good fit for my wife who wears large/extra large.  The quality of the shirt was very nice"
1.0,I love the pants however they are not bamboo they are 65% polyester and 35% rayon. Yet they are costing what a better quality fabric will cost. Great pants but not what I ordered.
1.0,I guess for the price I can't complain but it looks cheap!
1.0,"Looks so cute in the picture.  In person, they were mismatched on size, cheap thin material, and child sized."
1.0,The quality is not good
1.0,Worst thing I ever ordered. Don't do it. The shirt was huge. Plus ugley. Didn't look like picture
1.0,"The box says xl. But I should have known better. They were cheaper and the reviews good. Aint NO WAY IN THE WORLD are those gloves xl. I think they meant to spell “xSmall” for children. I don’t know what they making these gloves out of. I do know for certain that these companies are robbing us. I’ve tried a few, I’m just exhausted from calling to complain. Amazon doesn’t make things better. They want you to send the ultra thin gloves. Asking and borderline interrogating you about how many you’ve use already. And why you didn’t contact them sooner. (Insert blank stare).  Meanwhile you need them , so you put on three 3 THREE pairs. Because you trying desperately to make it work. All the gloves rips and tears in different places ."
1.0,To big world be good for travel
1.0,Hated it right out of the bag and even more when I tried it on.
1.0,Product had a chemical smell and not comfortable at all
1.0,They keychain is super cute and I loved it but the tassel came untied within less than a week. I’m not really rough with my keys so I don’t understand what happened. I enjoy it without the tassel but it’s not as fun.
1.0,"This bracelet broke after one month of having it. The rings that attach the charm have come loose. So the charm has fallen off. I wear this bracelet since I’m diabetic, and should anything happen people would know. But now that the charm has fallen off Its pretty much useless. I would not recommend buying this bracelet."
1.0,I knew it was cheap but I thought I could wear it...well i can't...you can see the glue and the flower is not white it is YELLOW. It is cheap and wack all around but I figured for the price so I'm not mad.
1.0,VERY SMALL. Ordered a size up after reading reviews but still did not fit! May need to order 2-3 sizes up.
1.0,"My worst purchase ever. I bought these for my daughter's award ceremony, she only put them on for that day and by noon they looked like this. Horrible quality!!!"
1.0,Nowhere near fitting. Ordered a size up as well..
1.0,First before I begin. My package was delivered with nothing to protect the sunglasses. No cardboard. No foam. Not even plastic baggies to protect the sunglasses from being crushed.<br />These feel super cheap! But dont look too bad. The eyeglass feel loose and the rims also feel like they might break after a few open and collapse. Honestly there are a few sunglasses that are about the same price as these. Get those instead.
1.0,Don't bother buying this. The gold faded on the first wear. Should have known from the price anyway...
1.0,Dress very beautiful in person than in the picture.  Unfortunately  it runs small. I order an XL and is more like a medium.
1.0,Cheap material. Fits awkward. Color in pic was blue and white. When I got it it was black and white. Too small.
1.0,Se me arruinó rápido
1.0,"Coarse and stiff. Doesn’t stay on head, keeps riding off."
1.0,"Worn this for two hours now, and a gem is already missing.<br />I’ve just been sitting here, watching TV. No water, no activity.<br />The ring also makes a sound when you shake it, as if gems are going to fly off."
1.0,The noses came smashed into a tiny box and unsurprisingly they are now completely misshapen. Left them out overnight hoping they’d shape properly but it didn’t happen.
1.0,The chain keeps breaking after having it for a week. Super disappointing. Was my favorite necklace now I can never wear it.
1.0,I am somewhat heavy in the chest so I went buy the size chart and decided that the large would be ok for my bust size not to big but not to tight. When I got the dress there is absolutely no way I could wear this  in public it was so tight in the bust it was crazy. They may be true to size is you have no bust.
1.0,Wrong size and not what I expected will never order again
1.0,They are more like plastic then leather. No arch support as advertised. Left was too small right was too big both size 8<br />Very disappointed
1.0,This shirt is made of the cheapest material! Looks awful and was way too big. Not to mention the awful chemical smell! I think it might be from the fabric it is made of or the warehouse it was made in. Immediate return for me.
1.0,"This was supposed to be a gift for my daughter, but I'll be returning it. Poor quality. Poor sizing."
1.0,NO COTTON AS WAS ADVERTISED. False advertising.
1.0,Makes my feet hurt ! Disappointing for a vionic sandal.
1.0,Love the vest unfortunately it did not fit  under the sizes I would be a 3X and there are none in this product.  I am a 2xl  in almost any brand and there are some in which I can wear a 1xl.  Unfortunately for me the vest did not run true to the size.  The best look great unfortunately I can't wear it because of the size.
1.0,"You get what you pay for...or in this case, almost...I got 3 of them and it would cost more to send them back than they're worth :("
1.0,I'm 5'9'' 165 lbs and I'm SWIMMING in a LG.  Also came without the belt. Not impressed.
1.0,Waste of money!! The top part is loose. It doesn't hold you tight. The upper part makes you look Extremely bulky. All the fat rolls up to your breast. You absolutely look crazy. Refund please
1.0,"It was very cheap, not as shown in picture!"
1.0,Did not do anything to help vision
1.0,The large is smaller than a normal small t shirt. It is not a soft stretchy material either.
1.0,The metal in the bra stabs you. Not well made
1.0,"I really liked the picture of this hat. The reason I say this is because it's not what you're going to get. Read the fine print in the description section. They say you might get this one, but in reality, they don't have this black leather w/ cream color fleece."
1.0,Band clasp broke almost immediately
1.0,"I'm 5'3 120 lbs.... I got a small....This product, doesn't look like the pic....and the top...the edge of the dress don't look like the pic....and it's falling off..... I have either hem it to fit or send back."
1.0,Looks cheap. Print is faded.
1.0,"I'm a fly fishing instructor/ guide and been testing many products for last few years and this one can be good one if they redesign the size because the material on this waders are very good. I bought a med (5'9 155 and from the waist to knee is baggy so the rub by knees when walking. Thinking about returning it...<br />Update: As you can see the waders gave out and leaking, don't know how this company will take care this issue, wait and see."
1.0,Shipping was quick but that is the only positive thing I can say about this shirt. It is very cheaply made and shrunk tremendously after one wash. Not worth the price in my opinion.
1.0,"This wig looked great at first.  But, a few weeks before a con, I took it out of the bag and it was all tangled.  I washed and conditioned it, and doused it in detangling oil.  I could not brush or comb it without huge clumps of hair coming out with every pass.  I will not be buying from this company again!"
1.0,I bought it by mistake and am returning it tomorrow
1.0,H O R R I B L E.  2 guys tore through a dozen pairs doing landscape gardening in about 3 days.  Previous dozen pairs from a different company lasted an entire month.  Very poor quality.
1.0,"This product was a waste of my money.  The spray did not make any changes to my boot, the spray made the boot look wet and stayed this way"
1.0,"My husband bought this for me for Valentine's Day.  I did not know it was going to be such a pain to wear!  Took it to 2 jewelers to have links taken out of band.  They are ceramic links, and not everyone works on them.  Second jeweler told me they could send it off to have it done.  All of the going around to different jewelers, leaving it with them, and getting it back, then finally sending it off to someone in Oklahoma took about 3 months.  I put it on, turned my wrist over to fasten clasp (it is also tricky), turned wrist back over to see it, and you can tell from picture that the little blue month dial is detached and floating in the face.  You can even see in the lower right of the face the bare circle where it was glued? attached?  The return window is closed, but buyer beware."
1.0,Very boxy and much smaller than expected. It looked like it could be a festival crop top. I ordered a medium.
1.0,"Not as described 3D, had to return it"
1.0,"Just don't like it, at all"
1.0,I purchased these to affix to my grand daughter's clogs.  There is no way to attach them to the shoes. The rear of each piece is smooth. Not sure what to do with  item. Very disappointed.
1.0,Too small. I sent it back
1.0,dead battery
1.0,Had to return my jumpsuit I even order a size up. No deal I returned it
1.0,The band is very stiff and could not even put around wrist. The mickey images were very fuzzy/not clear. Disappointing
1.0,Black shirt had bright white buttons and white thread. All the seems are coming apart and extra thread that wasn’t properly cut off. Quite disappointing.
1.0,"These are made like they aren’t made to be worn. I chose a medium based on sizing and it fit my boobs, but wouldn’t cover my nipples. I thought ok, maybe it’s too big if it’s not covering my nipples, so I got a small. Tighter on my boobs, still doesn’t cover nipples almost exactly the way the mediums did. The angle at which it is cut, cuts too low and never covers the damn nipple. So, leaking happens because the nipples aren’t covered. It’s a weird design. Therefore, not going to do what it was designed for. Unless your nipples are close to your ribcage. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
1.0,"The crotch part goes really high on the legs in the front,  no thanks."
1.0,Very poor quality.  Completely see thru
1.0,"Ordered a medium, received a small. Was in the process of sending it back, but gave it to my daughter-in-law. Reordered a medium, but again received a small. I ended up keeping it, but it doesn’t fit the way I like. Somebody needs to learn how to read."
1.0,It was a faded black color not black black the dressed fitted well just the color
1.0,"Le di una valoración de 1 ya que de los dos shorts uno llegó con un agujero, y es muy frustrante que pase eso y no despierte de lo decepción del niño de toda forma se puso el otro y le quedó un poco largo pero eso lo esperaba aunque tiene 9 años le pedí un 14/16 ya que es de contextura fuerte......pero muy triste por el que está dañado...."
1.0,"Seemed nice at first, but broke within the first month:("
1.0,Burst
1.0,These masks are NOT good for a pandemic but they are fine for any other purpose. I expected a little more fabric than this...
1.0,Stone is not very secure therefore it slides around a bit. Size runs a little small.
1.0,Poor quality broke the first time wearing<br />Very sad it was a gift --
1.0,"This thing is a total scam! Fell off in minutes and my boobs just fell out under the bra. Did not hold me at all! I wear a size 38D, maybe a B cup size breast would be ok but I doubt it."
1.0,Disappointed that frames were twisted/bent
1.0,"I tried to return it, but shipping back is more than 1/2 the cost of the item!<br /><br />Be aware that the color is not even close to what is pictured!"
1.0,I need to return this bad quality item.  Please send me the free return label.
1.0,Order a size up.  Unsure if this will help or they will only make it wider. Poorly made. Looks used.  The buttons on the sleeves give it more of a cheap look.  T
1.0,I got this item for my daughter. The necklace was broke she has not had a chance to wear it.
1.0,Didn't like the fabric.
1.0,No wet grip. Don’t use in construction
1.0,"I had bought these to give to our future son-in-law on his wedding day. Thankfully I noticed it didn’t say married, but marred. I gave them later and we laughed about it after the fact."
1.0,Pure junk. About half as thick as the original lenses. Didn't seat right due to this. They are also not polarized. Feels like cheap knockoffs.
1.0,"The material was hard and itchy. I would have returned this. However, I’m bed bound due to cancer treatment. Wouldn’t recommend at all."
1.0,This was super cheap looking like something out of a quarter machine.. no thanks.
1.0,The band started peeling horrible 1st day in the park!
1.0,"My review star is on the listing, not on the shirt quality itself.<br /><br />This was my second order of this shirt. My first one was the 1 Pink. The pink has a cold shoulder. This time I ordered the 2 Yellow and it does not have the one cold shoulder. Both shoulders are solid. I've looked through the listing and nowhere does it mention there are two different style tops. In the photo the models hair covers the one shoulder, so you cannot see the full top of the shirt. In looking at the options in color, there seems to be a ""1 Color"" and a ""2 Color."" Maybe the ""2 color"" option is full sleeve tops? I do not know, but looking at the pictures, the colors with a 2 in front seem to show the model with hair covering the one shoulder.<br /><br />Review of the actual shirt: 4 star-Gorgeous color, but not the heathered yellow in the photo, it's more of a brighter bumble bee yellow. Very pretty! The bottom is looser/wider than the 1 Pink I got. Very soft fabric, not see through. I like the shirt, but it was not what I wanted nor what I ordered per the listing."
1.0,"Otherwise it's nice, necklace was really nice. It's very thin though."
1.0,Ordered a 2xl based on the size chart. It fits more like a size 12 than a size 20/22. The print is gorgeous but the fabric is very thin and the dress smelled very strongly of chemicals and a cigarette smoke smell.
1.0,Waste of money since they’re already breaking
1.0,"I received this scapular in a small envelope. When opened, the cord was cut and the end holding on side of the scapular was torn. There was no way to wear it or repair it.  I ended up destroying it per church guidelines in case it is blessed."
1.0,These socks were too short.  They fell short of the knee by about 2 inches.  They also broke down easily where my shoe rubbed on them from just one wear.  I would not buy this brand again.
1.0,Bent when I received
1.0,I don’t like it at all! Too small and looks very cheap.... Looks nothing like the photo.<br />Very disappointed
1.0,Broke within days of having it
1.0,The socks didn't fit.  Way too small.  I wear a size 10.
1.0,Broke really easily
1.0,Hated them! Size of the shoe inconsistent with the size indicated and the workmanship was very shoddy. Never buy this brand again and returned the shoes.
1.0,"Very Cheap material.  Faded, see thru, and several sizes smaller than true size."
1.0,Ridiculously small. Good for an 8 year old. Now sitting in my drawer and the hassle of returning it is simply not worth it.
1.0,this was broken when package arrived not worth the money !!
1.0,They were more like a wrist band not what I expected.
1.0,bent post and ear clip. rolling around in box with heavier item.
1.0,Had to return as it ran very small in size which was disappointing as I really did like the dress
1.0,I sent it back. Does not look as cute as the picture and kinda frumpy.
1.0,Nice color very thin material and a run extremely small. I did have to return it because I ordered a 2X and unfortunately a 2X is really X-small🙄.
1.0,"It does not look like the photo at all🙄in the photo, it looks like some gorgeous linen blend tank. It is a cheap cotton tank that has zero fashion flair to it. Zero. I believe they have better tanks at Walmart<br />I just threw it away. I thought it had a sexy vibe in the photo. It looked nothing like the photo."
1.0,Broke soooo easily!
1.0,They dont look nothing like the advertisement
1.0,"I can usually wear any size 10 or 12 comfortably so I ordered a large. It was too small everywhere but the waist and too short for someone 5'5""."
1.0,Broke in my pocket with one click after I placed my hand in.
1.0,unimpressed. breast region could have fit 2 small dogs while the bottom half for me great. fabric feels cheap and came crazily wrinkled. not worth having to return
1.0,"I washed this per the instructions, on cold, and laid flat to dry. After washing it was misshapen & shrunk up. Terrible quality."
1.0,"Actually no... In the reviews it said is just one layer down so I purchase the L size because I normally wears M,  to my surprise it's not one but two meaning the shirst were S and I'm not even able to use it and waste my money for them."
1.0,Ok dress
1.0,"I'm not sure why exactly this romper doesn't work for my body, but it sure doesn't! There is so much extra fabric sitting at my lower back and the chest area hangs too low...even with the straps adjusted as tight as they can go. I may deconstruct the straps and resew to see if I can fix, because the romper in the ad is super cute."
1.0,Broke the second it came out of the packaging
1.0,Shoes looked as if they had already been worn. I was very disappointed.<br />I did return them immediately.<br />I will just order from a regular shoe store in the future
1.0,I ordered the flowery ripped style and according to the chart I needed a size 2 (I'm normally a 3/4) and these shorts were HUGE! I think even a size 0 would've been too big. Also the description says free returns and that's not accurate because having UPS pick it up cost $6. I can't drive because of a disability so the cost of a taxi or uber to the nearest UPS drop off would've been a lot more. So no shorts and I'm out $6 on top of that. Not happy right now.
1.0,Useless. Nothing special.
1.0,Perfect thickness for snowy weather under a jacket.  Fit perfect! And loved the color!
1.0,Cheap an had holes in both pockets!!!
1.0,Terrible quality. Bought 2 different brands.  One higher priced and neither could be compared to masks I had previously purchased.  I do believe that they were 1 layer and advertised as 3 layers.  One was to have white lining and did not.<br />I am ashamed of Amazon for carrying such disgraceful merchandise..
1.0,I’m an XS and this is huge! Material huge! So much to it material wise. Looks cute in the picture but I looked like a hot air balloon. Not sure if this would work for everyday fashion. Cute concept but I am 5’6” 110 pounds. It weighs more than me. Maybe would work for someone with more height/weight but certainly not for the petite. Too bad as it is very nice quality and beautifully made. They could have just made 4 skirts out of one.
1.0,I liked this wallet up until I just pulled it out of my purse and it's literally falling apart. The seam from the outside pocket completely split. It's cheap fake leather and cheaply made. Not worth it.
1.0,Horrible material made with poor design
1.0,They keep falling out of my ear.  Move too much.
1.0,"The material is very cheap, stretches out very easy not spandex at all..not something I could workout with at all<br />Terrible purchase"
1.0,"Terrible product !  Only lasted 3 months ... normal use, no abuse !"
1.0,"You get what you pay for!  Cheap material, poor stitching, low height so the mosquito netting drags on the ground by 3 inches. I would love to return it but box is no good. Don't waste your hard earned money on this.<br />forgot to mention crank is hard to turn and looks like it won't last long."
1.0,"Way too small. My daughter wears a size medium in clothes and this belt was way to small for her. It'd work great for someone who wears a size 0-4, but if your much bigger than that it will be too tight and the elastic will wear out from being overstretched."
1.0,Passed on this one. Didn't like the material texture at all. Looks cheap.
1.0,Terrible looked cheap and were to small. I wouldn't even give them a star but I have to!
1.0,This broke in the first 2 hours of wear it. Very disappointed that I just tossed it.
1.0,50$ for this shirt? You have got to be kidding! That’s ridiculous.
1.0,sale como entregado pero jamas lo entregaron
1.0,"The box came damaged and one of the pillows is missing, very disapointed"
1.0,"Looks like a black garbage bag. Very cheaply made and the seams on the sides are sown wrong, look like the sides are scrunched. Definitely not as pictured or advertised."
1.0,"Its see through, and rather big. I ordered a small and its huge and flowy."
1.0,"Completely see through, so, a bit disappointed with this one. Will keep it to wear over a unitard at some point but cannot be worn alone."
1.0,"Cheap material. Looks terrible in person, NOT like the picture"
1.0,Watch out. Very deceived by the fact that there's only one not a pair. I thought I was ordering 2 pairs. I had bought a pair from another seller and they work great that's why I wanted to buy two more. I will return these and buy from different seller
1.0,"low quality products, wrong size"
1.0,Super smalllll a 3X is probably a large.
1.0,"The size is cute, put the color is like a p00p greenish mint. I painted over it and it looks much better."
1.0,These earrings are crap. Two sets came with the posts broken off. One set came with no backing. 5 of the other sets have post that are bent and probably wont last long. VERY disappointed. Box was properly packed and not damaged so it is obvious that they came from the manufacturer this way.
1.0,the product I received was poorly made with very cheap material. The jacket was cut short like a mid- drift and  the size ratio to US is not accurate at all. The retailer responded very quickly and sent a second item which was worse than the first and refunded my money without question.
1.0,Padding is very bulky and slips around to the back after you wash it.
1.0,"Horrible. Looks nothing like the photo. It feels like cheap stretchy material. The green is like a Kelly green, definitely not what I had expected. The &#34;drawstring&#34; is fake...it just kind of hangs there and does nothing and the weird stitching in front leaves a huge gap in the front."
1.0,Nothing like the picture. The one that came in was so short it just passed the hips and stopped. My fiancé was disappointed. I ended up returning it and ordering from a different vendor.
1.0,"highly disappointed<br />I bought this as a surprise gift for my nephew’s 10th birthday.Completely different item was sent by seller.In item description it says table is foldable,but it is not.As air flow is very slow,puck is not even moving.Poor birthday boy was very disappointed.It was a gift so  I can not ask them to repack it and send it back."
1.0,"Pretty choker but even on the tightest clasp, it isn't considered a &#34;choker.&#34; It still hangs somewhat and gem doesn't stay forward facing often. I was expecting a necklace with one clasp, not multiple since it is a choker. Other than that, it's a simple, dainty, elegant necklace. Tarnished already!"
1.0,This shirt is very oddly shaped and not flattering.  I sent it back.
1.0,"Poor quality, it warped , can't stay under the sun"
1.0,Bought 2 and they both broke within a week
1.0,I only received one set of twelve on this order.
1.0,"Wrong item, wrong size. It was cheap and thin material"
1.0,I had to return it. It looks like it was made for little kids. I wanted to love it. Also sizing was off. I ordered it for baptism and was really bummed.
1.0,Linkage broke at the head after first use.
1.0,These claim to be toddler socks but here is my daughter and I each wearing one. I have very large size 9 adult feet.
1.0,No directions come with this pair of shoelaces and 4 metal pieces
1.0,"Lovely, but the size 16s which should have been roomy fit like a size 12, in other words not at all!"
1.0,Too big. Won’t stay on standard nose pads.
1.0,Hated the whole thing. Donated it to homeless shelter.
1.0,This was not what I had expected at all. They look very cheap in person and not at all like the picture and are so saggy when they are on. I DO NOT recommend this product AT ALL!
1.0,"This product in the light peach/coral us NOTHING like the length in the photo. I'm about 5'3"" and it's approximately mid calf. 8-10"" off the floor! Disappointed as I planned to wear it the weekend I ordered it. Returning a.s.a.p. The black color was as pictured. It is floor length.  I don't understand why this huge discrepancy in length."
1.0,"Couldn't use, the arch was way to pronounced and gave me pain. Could not even use once"
1.0,Terrible quality will not stay together
1.0,I love the design aspect with tiny holes that helps with perspiration while working out and this was the unique feature to make me buy this however it has ruined all the surfaces I came in contact with while wearing it for the first time including my white Apple Watch. Very unhappy and disappointed. Why does it stain?
1.0,I bought this dress and got something that looked similar to the dress but was not the same. I did not receive a belt and the seam around the waist was crooked. To sum it all up this dress simply looked cheap and I will not be purchasing a new one.
1.0,Not well made- very awkward. No lining in bust.
1.0,The top of the hat is top heavy
1.0,"These were so tiny, they wouldn’t fit in my nose. I am disappointed because they look cute."
1.0,I'm 5'6'' 140 lbs. I ordered a S and I received what was labeled a S but looked like an XL. There were loops for a belt but no belt was included. Pretty much just hung on me like a garbage bag.
1.0,As soon as I took these out of the package I was disgusted. The feel and touch to my hands grossed me out. I would never ever recommend these!
1.0,"Do not waste your money! These have a horrible chemical smell, so bad that you can not wear them."
1.0,"This would be a beautiful bracelet, but, it cannot be fastened. Clasp is to big to fit in rings"
1.0,"Keychain itself is nice and elegant. The leather strap was lost because it was held by 2 screws which have mysteriously disappeared due to what I am assuming, is normal wear and tear. 1 star because it lasted only 1 month. Mehr lets make sure we use thread lock on these screws."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Awful and very cheap. Sleeves were too short.
1.0,Dont order!
1.0,"Looks cheap, and not a flattering cut"
1.0,This shirt was better suited to fit a child. Bought for a friend and she wears it as more of a crop top and she is a size 4
1.0,"First of all, the hat came in a soft plastic envelope and was crushed.  the strap cannot be removed and the sized cannot be adjusted as advertised.  I strongly recommend you do not buy this product."
1.0,I have another pair of these socks that are developing holes in them. This is the second pair that I have had the problem with. Very disappointed with the durability of these socks. The company sent me a replacement pair of socks to replace the first pair that had the holes. Please advise on how you will be able to make this problem correct for me. See pictures above. Look forward to a favorable resolution to the problem.<br />Thank you!
1.0,It wasn't what I thought I ordered. I was very disappointed with the product.
1.0,Just received this in the mail today and it was ripped at the seam . Horribly disappointed!  I would  say very cheaply made!!
1.0,VERY small.
1.0,No support in bra area tops pushes your bra area down. Not flattering at all<br />Top way to blousy<br />Would not buy again
1.0,This luggage was a priced well. Unfiurtunetly it does not last. On my first trip with it the zipper ripped off the bag. The wheels got hard to roll and make a lot of noise. Will never by again.
1.0,"I really loved the glasses, the frame and color, however, I have been having trouble seeing clearly through them. I finally compared them to my other glasses that have a strength of 2.5.<br />I then looked at the glasses themselves, and the strength is not noted on them anywhere. Again, I took them off and put on another pair, I was able to see a lot better through the other pair. I put these back on, and unfortunately they sent me the wrong strength or something is wrong with the lenses. I was not able to see as clearly out of them than my old 2.5.<br />I am very disappointed."
1.0,"Don’t purchase they don’t look anything like  the photo cheaply made, right away went to the donate pile."
1.0,The part between the eyes on both masks ripped the first time I put them on.. might aswell have gotten a balaclava because that's what they look like now anyways
1.0,I wanted to love this dress. I like taking unexpected pieces and diva them up. This disappointed. The top was huge and waist too tight. My measurements are 38-30-42. Tried several sizes but cut for top heavy only women.
1.0,Nice warm coat for my son but the main zipper is plastic and broke within the first couple times of him wearing it.
1.0,"The black sleeves were great. Stretchy and soft, have enough material to be up to the shoulder and have plenty of room in the sleeve that it stayed up.<br /><br />The camo ones on the other hand are a different story. They are stiff, not stretchy at all. They don't even go to the shoulder comfortably. The stitching up by the hand and up the arm started popping and the material is retreating from the stitching at the hand after only one hour of use. They don't feel like the same material as the black ones.<br />Avoid this version and just get all black ones. Very disappointed as I look forward to using the camo designed ones with my work shirts. Already started the return and looking for another solution."
1.0,Too tight around the crotch area couldn't spread my legs
1.0,One earring was smashed & the other was broken completely with no stud or backing<br />SUPER CHEAP LOOKING
1.0,Ordered a small and it looks like a large
1.0,"This is not a key ring, I was badly deceived, too small, like a joke!!  Already requested refund. Badly disappointed!!"
1.0,Very hard to install and we’re not tight enough.  Couldn’t take out without destroying them.  Do not recommend.
1.0,Too small and very short
1.0,I returned this item - it arrived too late and indeed looked like a bathrobe- it is not as classy looking as the photo
1.0,I bought these 2pairs of compression socks around the middle of January. Toda is the first of April. I have 12 pairs of compression socks in total and change my socks every day. That is about 73 days. I could not have possibly worn them more than 6 times and one of the socks has a horizontal tear. I will not buy their products again.
1.0,Nice but it is very small.
1.0,Cheep cheep cheep... broke during first wear!!
1.0,Lost its stickiness after just a couple uses
1.0,Extremely cheap product.  I only had for 1 month and the minute hand broke. Would not recommend
1.0,"Not the fabric that is shown in the picture, not impressed at all"
1.0,From the outside it's cool... the bag is junk
1.0,Wayyy Smaller than average sizes
1.0,Not happy with this dress... Im 5 feet and 4 inches tall around 175 lbs I am very voluptuous 38D and I wear a size 13 bottoms. The fit was so horrible. the leotard was so small that it did not curve to my body and you see all of my bra hanging out on side. The leotard was made from cheap cotton... The overall construction was bad
1.0,Was excited to get the pink shown in the listing. What I received is nowhere close.
1.0,Turned yellow within a month
1.0,"I wish it had looked like the picture. Way too small in the waist, I chose my size accordingly but as usual the product sizing was off. Poor quality fabric and much shorter than pictures, very disappointed as I was looking forward to wearing."
1.0,The box was empty!! I'd like to have my bracelet please!!!
1.0,Does not have a hood and material is very bad.
1.0,Weak don't work for cleaning
1.0,"As now I look at the reviews I see all of them say this jacket is small.<br />I ordered a XXL, it was a medium although the tag on inside of the collar is XXL.<br />Amazon should not let this happen!!<br />Waste of my time!!"
1.0,"This is the most horrid excuse for a dress I have ever seen in my life. The waistline lands in a crazy place halfway on top of the bust and halfway under it. The buttons are so cheap and twice as big and the buttonhole. There were uncut threads hanging from the top and bottom of the seams and from the sleeve hems and the skirt hem.. I swear I did a better job of sewing my first dress at age 9 in the 4-H Club. I'm sure they would fall apart after being worn 10 minutes, because not one of the seams was closed at the beginning or the end. What a nightmare!!! The fabric has pretty colors, and that is the ONLY nice thing that can be said. But this is by far the cheapest quality I have ever seen. How embarrassing it would be, for someone to see you wearing this piece of crap. It's just sad..... really, really sad. Try to pull up some cute puppy picture to recover from the trauma and then go on with your life. Never come back to ZAN STYLE ... EVER EVER EVER again!!!"
1.0,Does not sound like a train whistle.
1.0,It fell apart the first day. Not happy at all with the product
1.0,All stones fall out after first month! I really like it but it goes in the garbage because there is no stones now! Not worth the money at all!
1.0,I ordered this two piece to wear out of town it came fast. I didn't try it on just threw it in my bag get out of town and the two piece had been worn the bottom of the pants was dirty like it had been dragged I'm so mad
1.0,"The Dark Arts socks are supposed to be 80% cotton and they're ALL polyester. They arrived the day of the party so I had no choice but to give them anyway. I paid $6 a pair for cheap synthetic socks, I'll never buy from this seller again."
1.0,Fits terribly. The cloth is so thin it's transparent. The seams are jagged and misaligned. It's just the worst thing by far I've ever purchased on Amazon. Beyond disappointed.😔
1.0,Was uneven
1.0,"Very disappointed, this sweater Does Not hang off one shoulder at all."
1.0,"The stones have fallen out of both, I've gotten no response.  So I decided to fix them, under magnification I see the stones are not moonstones but glass with something attached to the bottom to make them look iridescent."
1.0,The bag did not bring the adjustable strap. Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered this band despite reviews because I have had very good luck with the one I ordered from this company in Feb 2017. Unfortunately this is not the same quality and the item will not snap into Gear Fit2. Returning.
1.0,It is nothing like the picture shown.
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes up and still too small.... not very supportive either.
1.0,"This wallet was too stiff...kinda like woody cardboard or tough cardstock.  if you're wanting this one, way about 4 months to &#34;soften&#34; up"
1.0,color not represented well at all has large bright red stripes down the sides. fit was weird really baggy around the middlw
1.0,Does not fit like the measurements say.
1.0,"The cut was extremely awkward and way too big and ill fitting. I didn't even wear it one time. I was so disappointed because I was excited about it. I think if you were really chubby and really short it might look good, but I doubt it! 😑"
1.0,It's just two aluminum pieces the size of a credit card wrapped with a rubber band. And it's hell trying to get your cards in or out of it.
1.0,"It was so small, I immediately returned it and bought something else"
1.0,Loved these for three weeks. Then the black connector that joins the shoe and strap broke. There is no way to fix it.
1.0,It doesn't cost much however This product is very cheaply made. Not comfortable on your wrist
1.0,Broke after one wear. Wore for the 4th of July. Between sweat and pool water the wood warped and cracked and the glasses broke. They aren't expensive but I did expect them to last longer than one day. Love supporting small U.S. businesses but maybe the wood sides was a miss.
1.0,Not actually tights. They're leggings. Not what I wanted or expected
1.0,The fabric shines and feels slick and the green color is not a pretty green.  It is very dark.  I am returning this product.
1.0,Not slim fit as it says in the subscription.  Tag clearly says regular fit. Original price tag is cut like it is being resold. You're allowing this Amazon?
1.0,It never worked and contacting the seller was useless.
1.0,TURNED BLACK AFTER WEARING A SHORT TIME
1.0,Made in China. Very flimsy. Took weeks to arrive. I ordered xl and they are so small. 26 inch elastic waist is not stated. I’m glad that I am able to gift them to a teen.
1.0,This was a bday present but so disappointed that I will probably not give. There is no infinity scarf as stated in description and the unicorn on the shirt is ironed on and not sewn on. Looks cheap. Tutu is very wrinkly. Ive ordered tutus off amazon before and they were no where as wrinkly. Very disappointed!
1.0,Runs small and not the best quality
1.0,bad stitching around the waist. My wife did not like it at all. too thin and too long.
1.0,the collar is frayed after 2 washings
1.0,"Fabric it's not soft, it's itchy and not breathable at all"
1.0,got this in. it looked great except it had add your name across it. didnt give me option to put a name. figured it wouldve been blank then.
1.0,Worst ever item I came across on Amazon in 13 years. It can see through and this is not even worth 50 cents. I would put it on an outdoor scarecrow or something. Please don't buy from this business. Appalling to even have this ridiculous price. Like it is made from 50 year old material. I would be embarrassed if worked for this company.
1.0,The size of the bangle is too small compared to the image given.
1.0,Looks like it was cheaply made
1.0,Was supposed to receive 5 but only 4 in package
1.0,"NOT WORTH BUYING,,,,LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO.....YOU WILL GET BETTER QUALITY BUYING AT A FIVE AND DIME STORE."
1.0,"This fabric is so bad.  It is 100% scratchy polyester and super thin, you can see right through it when you hold it up as you can see in my first pic.  It's the kind of material that catches on any piece of dry skin it hangnail you might have.  Ugh.  Mine also came with these weird seams in the back.  No where in the pics for the item does it show any seams in the back.  I can't attest to the fit of it as I'm not going to bother trying on.  Sending back.  I think the only accurate thing is the color."
1.0,The top of the shoe is so thin that it tore a hole from bumping into a leg of a chair.
1.0,Absolutely horrible quality!! Decal was completely ruined after one wash.
1.0,Thin and just not wearable.
1.0,It does not have a nose bridge like the model and is dull looking.  Very unfortunate no returns
1.0,Threw this product out right after taking it out of the bag. It’s a terrible product. Do not waste your money on this junk.
1.0,"I would love to support these woman, however my money needs to matter too. They came on time. But that is the only good thing I can say. One is broke. The colors are beyond horrible, nothing I would ever wear or own, and the size of the bracelet.....TINY! I had even asked them to try to pick some that were a tich longer so I could stack multiples. Even with a positive response to my request, not one &#34;longer&#34; one was sent!  These would not fit any woman I know. Thankfully I had ordered a set off of Etsy. They are bright, beautiful and we'll made and they fit! I can stack all of them from Etsy if I want to. I could not be more unhappy with this purchase if I wanted to be. Should have been a feel good purchase from woman to woman and I am left with ugly bracelets and the pain of having to create a return.<br />UPDATE.....I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE COMPANY! I AM FILING A CLAIM WITH AMAZON OVER THIS SELLER. FAIR WARNING<br />...DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER."
1.0,"I do not like this shirt, I should have gotten something else. it fits poorly. and took too long to arrive."
1.0,Listen to reviews on this cheaply made and costly  product  is way too much.
1.0,"Only gave 1 star bc it wouldn't let me just make a comment. This hat sucks. I could have made a hat that looks better than this one. I didn't read the reviews before ordering so it's my fault I know, but dont waste ur money on this. I went to Logang website and ordered my son real items for his bday."
1.0,Was sent a child sized dress.
1.0,Shipped a watch with a dead battery in it. Never again.
1.0,My son liked the mask but was disappointed that the LED light even with batteries being changed did not work at all he said he was able to breathe and see out of the mask fine I thought it was an actual helmet not a mask type of material
1.0,"I ordered a smaller size per the other reviews and this was huge on me! And the fabric was itchy, even after washing. What a waste!"
1.0,The rubber ends stretch after about one week of use and they are useless after that
1.0,"I am allergic to polyester but this scarf was described as a ""Cotton Scarf"" but when I received it and took it out of the package, it was full of static that only non-cotton material would have. I inquired about it to the merchant and they wrote back stating that it was 100% Polyester! Why did the merchant write in the title of this item that it was a Cotton scarf knowing that it was made of 100% Polyester? It's falsely advertised! Returning it for a full refund!"
1.0,My GF gave me a Navy Ralph Lauren sweatpants for Christmas I love in them and I saw this bought it what a great deal. I wanted a different color absolutely not the same Ralph Lauren sweatpants the quality feel and look.
1.0,I purchase items only when/if returnable. Only fair if I don’t like it. Item is small. Does not fit eyes appropriately. Perhaps more for a child’s face.
1.0,This is a cute blouse but not one I would recommend. The material is very thin. And it seems to be for flat chested girls. I am not pleased with this at all. The blouse in the package looked like a hanky.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4d3a0c7fe62606728ef464a0936329af]] 925? More like cheap steel or something else... less than a week of wear and it's fading and looks like it's rusting.
1.0,I bought the army green shirt and the color looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,What a waste of money
1.0,"This swimsuit is unlined and the holes in the crochet pattern are big enough to see everything through! It is absolutely unwearable in public, which is a shame because it is very cute."
1.0,"When I got the shirt it looked like it was drug on the floor, it had dirt on it in a few places. When I tried it on it was a joke. All my shirts with 22 necks are always a little loose on me. This one the front of the shirt lacked 4 inches from even be able to button up.  Well that is my first and last time I will ever try this brand. Buyer Beware!"
1.0,"These earrings are cute, but they are too bendy. You can't snap them in their slit, it bends. The whole earring moves and misshapes. They are made with silver beads on a heart shaped wire. These are not sturdy enough."
1.0,"These look NOTHING like the picture! They are brown, have fringe all around the foot opening. I am beyond frustrated with how strikingly different they are from what I was expecting."
1.0,"This fit, but it fit weird. I didn't want ot be bothered with the hassle of returning so it will be donated"
1.0,These chains are flimsy and mine broke the first day I had it.
1.0,Extremely small... for a child possibly..
1.0,Shirt looks nothing like what I ordered. It has slits down the sides of the arms & bunched. Picture shows lose fitting tee with peek aboo holes. Very disappointed!!!!
1.0,The mental snapped after 3 weeks. Don’t waste the money.
1.0,Literally so thin it sucks so much you can literally buy a better shirt at Ross.
1.0,"Awful.. these were a replacement from the first pair I bought that came bent , not what I ordered at all"
1.0,"I am I am about 5’1 and I ended up getting a size small because that my size for skirts, well this was so large on me it felt like a large on, however I did get a small but didn’t fit right at all!!!"
1.0,"We ordered mediums which ended up too small. So we went ahead and ordered 2 XLs. They are the same exact measurements as the mediums were, still too small."
1.0,"Frames were bent when they arrived and wouldn't  adjust back to normal. Also, style was not cute :("
1.0,"Just say no....not sure what the fabric actually is since there are no tags.  Uncomfortable see through non-breathable fabric with clear, plastic buttons.  My 38” bust did not fit in the XXL sized for a 46” + bust measurement."
1.0,Lost charm day one charms are loose
1.0,"The material ofshirtis very cheap, my hanes shirts material ar a better quality what a rip off. I t feels asif I am wearing a holter top."
1.0,constantly falls off aweful
1.0,Ordered an adult large and it’s so small it could be a woman’s or child’s size. I asked for a return and they’re only refunding $7.70 of the $24.95 purchase price. Unsatisfactory!
1.0,I was very disappointed that I wore these twice and already have holes in them. I paid good money for them and not happy that they have holes.
1.0,It's an ok purse. My clasp part of the purse was put on crooked lol. You get what you pay for. My strap broke while on my shoulder so I just carried it on my hand. It is cheaply made but I made it work. I'll still be carrying it until the threads fall out lol.
1.0,"First of all let me start by that the shoes are adorable and fit true to size. However, the shoes I got were preowned ( now based on the description I ordered new shoes) but that’s not what I received they were scuffed and dirty and there was something rattling in one of the heels. I ordered these to wear to a work event in two days and now I definitely can’t wear them I am returning them ASAP and now I don’t know what I will do for shoes. Thanks Amazon"
1.0,"I ordered the blue scarf and when it finally arrived it isn't a scarf at all it's literally a small piece of fabric. It's way way too small to even wear as a scarf.  It is NOTHING like the picture they have advertising the product. You get what you pay for I guess, so disappointed. Will be sending it back since it's not even wearable."
1.0,These were not good quality. Not easy to wear and thin.
1.0,"Internal parts detached and rattle when moved after 6 months of use. Runs too hot to touch. For safety reasons, cut the cord and recycled the plastic and electronics."
1.0,Broke after a month or so. Came apart after light use & after one month of use.
1.0,"Super cheap, ugly material. It looked like a plastic brick so we returned them."
1.0,The box is literally empty. And now my son... who has been waiting “forever” for “Tafiti’s Heart from Moana” .... is crying and I have to listen to it....
1.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this hat given my passion for Lagavulin....however, I was amazed at how cheap and unreadable the logo on it was.  Very strange.  I've seen other hats and shirts from single malt whisky distileries, and this just seems like an afterthought.  At the least it should be embroidered.  It's a great logo, just too bad it looks so cheap and barely readable."
1.0,Way too big.  These socks are not Newborn socks as the title claims.  They are actually size 6-12 months.  I see in the description below that they are actually 6-12 months.  Disappointed because the socks are thick and would be warm for older babies.
1.0,It just kept breaking on her. I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Not good size  is too small ..<br />Not worth the price at all<br />I do not recommend to any one..<br />It looks a cheap in real
1.0,These are huge! They look like you are wearing feather dusters as earrings. The quality of them is disappointing. They look cheap and tacky.
1.0,We bought these shoes for our son to walk in rainy weather during the autumn season. But they are not waterproof even remotely. Water will easily get through. Misleading marketing.
1.0,Right slipper broke the second time I wore it
1.0,The material feels very cheap. They have absolutely no stretch anywhere but the elastic waste and run very small. I wear a size 32 and bought an XL and it was snug on my legs. I did a squat after trying them on and herd some seams giving. Could see these falling apart fairly quick.
1.0,Wayyyy too small! Was excited to wear them but they look big enough for a child!
1.0,Whoever manufactured this cut the size tag out and hoped that I wouldn't notice that it was too small. Rotten way to do business.
1.0,The zipper on the back of both pair of gloves broke the first time they were used.  Very poorly made.  Would not recommend these.
1.0,I wear a Medium across a range of different clothing lines. The Medium in this dress was absolutely enormous to the point of literally falling off my shoulders. The fabric is also extremely thin and completely transparent.
1.0,"This dress is not a cotton blend. It is not stretchy. It is pure polyester and has a zipper and wouldn't fit a young child in the top. It's also completely see-through. I hate this and am sad I bought it. Doesn't come with a free gift, either. Piece of junk."
1.0,"Within a couple months sun damage changed the shape. Support would not help me. Now, the strap is broken along the seam. I do like them, but lack of support and quality doesn't make me rush to rebuy them"
1.0,It fits fine every where but at the bottom.  For a tunic it should fit all the way down.  I would send it back but I don't have any tags for it.  Stupid me took it on a trip without trying it on assuming it would be fine
1.0,"Huge!! I wear a size medium and this wrap is huge on me. The back side hangs below my rear end, the front fails to cover MY front and then hem is half way down my calf. I would look foolish walking around in this cover up. Thankfully I have some sewing skills and may be able to alter it, but I shouldn't have to! From reading other reviews, it sounds like they make them in various sizes but don't give the buyer a size option. They just send one and how it fits."
1.0,"This hat is TINY, I ended up giving this to my 6yo to put the size in perspective.<br /><br />The adjustable strap is very difficult to work as well - does not seem the design of the loop accounted for the extra thickness of the reflective patter on the strap."
1.0,"I bought it because of a Formal event and my dress required it but the adhesive did not fit... The minute I began to sweat it started peeling, also it was kinda itchy at times"
1.0,Broke after wearing one time
1.0,If I could give this less than one star I would. Both chains broke the day the girls wore them. These are NOT toddlers. 12 year-old twins wore them.  What an absolute waste of money
1.0,this was super ugly in person.
1.0,Nothing. Its crooked sewing
1.0,I sent it back right after trying on. It runs super small.
1.0,Had two pairs of these glasses and I take them off with two hand like you should with all glasses and they keep breaking in the same spot. High disappointed
1.0,The rubber band is incredibly short. No way could it an adult.  Threw them out.  Had to purchase similar item at a brick and mortar shop since I had cataract surgery and no luxury of time doing an exchange.
1.0,"The other reviewers are right. If you want them to fit well, order the next size up. These will be a great pair of pants...for someone else."
1.0,Don't like this piece at all looks very cheap
1.0,"Not true to size, I ordered a full-figured women’s size skirt, not a 1x size skirt."
1.0,Tooo big doesn't stay on my head
1.0,Cute but too small. No a plus size dress.
1.0,It doesnt look like picture and fabric is itchy. I wwoulnot reccomend it
1.0,"The size was not accurate, if you purchase this item get it a size bigger"
1.0,Would have been a 5 star review but my Zipper broke about 6 days after the return window closed and there is no way to contact the seller.
1.0,Did not fit and was tarnished before I even got to wear them
1.0,"This was 2+ sizes too small. I wear a XXXL regularly, my brother wears an XL regularly and it was super duper tight on him (I ordered XXXL)."
1.0,Just doesn’t work at all.  Doesn’t fit correctly and way to small in the pouch area
1.0,This skirt took over a month to arrive and it runs small. The 2X looks more like a medium.
1.0,"One time use, already broken"
1.0,The logo off front must be just some cheap tape and is already coming off right out of the package.  Big disappointment and I still have to give this as an Xmas gift.  Do not buy cheaply made.
1.0,Cheap is the word.
1.0,Nothing but a piece of junk. Got for costume for Halloween. Never used it because it broke while I was putting it on. Don't buy. Should be in a dollar store but not even worth $1.
1.0,These are poor quality. Cheap. Tossing them in the trash.
1.0,nice but size on pkg says (on the back) ages 3-12 (big span).  size on front says age 3-6.  Well which is it folks?  my grandkids have not tried them yet.  there is big diff in kids between ages 6 and 12.  one is 8 and the other 6. so we'll see. if they don't fit i'll find someone to give them to .. not worth a return but i wish it had been more specific about the age/fit and not have both age ranges on the package.
1.0,I ended up returning this. It was super flimsy.
1.0,Sent back - runs really small
1.0,"Disappointed as I looked them at first, but holes ripped in them within a few weeks.  Very thin."
1.0,"These are made in China, not Korea. Lots of typos on the package- they even put “fk94” on the package so they’re likely not real approved kf94 masks."
1.0,The picture made the dress look so cute but when it arrived I hated it. The material was uncomfortable wrinkled and the laced part was rough. I returned it weeks ago and still have not seen the credit on my card.
1.0,Shirt broke in less than a week
1.0,To small could not get on foot. I'm only a size 10/12 shoe.
1.0,I am5ft 7 and the sleeves were too short in an xl
1.0,Shoulder strap snap/clip broke after 2nd use.  Will never buy another of this brand!!!!
1.0,"Horrible, the material is awful it’s like paper! Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Dislike 👎 no stars ⭐️
1.0,Zero stretch. Absolutely terrible fit. I have no idea why these are described as stretchy
1.0,Fits horrible. Don’t buy
1.0,[[VIDEOID:57353872d60f8b95a52276d15cf92b27]] I recieved two empty boxes out of three !! Very bad service
1.0,Cheaply made and not a good grade of material
1.0,"I normally wear an 8/10 so I ordered a medium and this is way too big. I'm 5'5"" and it's at least 5 inches too long as well. Also, the slit is all the way on the side so the only way this looks remotely like the listing picture is if you twist the dress and pose... Definitely not happy with this one."
1.0,"Got this for my daughters 7th birthday as she asked for it a thousand times. Worked great for the day until you power it off, then it doesn’t turn back on! Spoke with amazon and they sent me a new one guess what? Same thing! So if you do buy the watch DON’T power it off or it will never turn on again! Waste of 30 bucks and sending both back"
1.0,The 7-8 is too wide and long for my foot.  I normally wear a 7.5 size shoe. I
1.0,These glasses have a nice finish and feel quality.  They come with a nice hard case and extras and have a nice mirror to them.<br /><br />Now the bad. They gave a very odd shape with a very aggressive V shape in the middle which makes them look very odd. However with a helmet on they look okay.  The nose piece is too narrow for even my small nose and on a short ten mile ride they became very irritating.  They distort my view too much for my liking.  I will be sending them back for these reasons.
1.0,Not 22 mm or even close
1.0,These are so small that they won't stay on.  The ear loops pop off so you have to keep messing with it.  Defeats the purpose.  Made for child.  And I do not have a large head!  Waste of money
1.0,"I ordered a large & was waiting at the door for it to come . I was so excited , however opened it & it was a 2X! So disappointed !!! We are going to the beach & couldnt wait to get it!"
1.0,"Too soft, doesn't hold it's shape...top part sticks up too much..."
1.0,"After one wear at the pool, the bottom is completely pilled.  Other bottoms I have still look new after a full season.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Seemed like good T shirts but did not survive the first washing.  My wife washed them in cold water then threw them in the dryer and they shrunk up like a wool sweater in the hot wash!  So tight now they feel like I'm putting on a body condom.  Brand new shop rags now.  Total bummer.
1.0,Runs very small! 2x fit like a medium! Definitely will be returning.
1.0,"It’s very cute, but once I got in the water, it’s started to loose it’s shape and get stretchy. Dosent hold you in like regular swimwear. I wouldn’t recommend"
1.0,Horrible bootie.  Color not as shown.  Terrible fit.  I returned them.  Carole Altendorf
1.0,Giving it away
1.0,Don’t know yet because it’s a gift
1.0,Bought these a few weeks ago for my hubby. They looked nice but a lot smaller then I thought they would be. Hubby was not a fan as it made him feel sticky and uncomfortable. Not breathable material either. I do not recommend.
1.0,I didn’t care for the material in this dress. It was see thru on the top so you would need to wear a slip. It fit as expected but I didn’t feel comfortable in this dress and returned it. The color was a very nice dark green.
1.0,"This never arrived - I ordered it as a Christmas present for someone and it didn't arrive. I didn't pursue it as it was a relatively cheap product and after Christmas was over, what was the point?<br /><br />It did teach me a lesson -  I will not buy from this vendor again."
1.0,Flensy
1.0,clasp is cheap - i returned
1.0,Super cheap looking. The color of the brown is just &#34;off&#34; which makes it look even worse. Waste.
1.0,Super cheap and bends very easy
1.0,The bow tie was child size certainly not for an adult. The pocket square was also small. Great if needed for a child!!
1.0,"The hats are too big overall, and the shape isn't flattering because there is too much extra fabric in the caps."
1.0,Awful. Pieces around the stand already broke & I only bought it mid September. Can I still get a refund?? 😢😢😢
1.0,This outfit isn’t stretchy. Also the material feels like a kite. Not comfortable at all!!!!
1.0,I didn’t like the quality. The look of it is very cheap. Way different than the quality that I’m used to and I wouldn’t recommend. The price is attractive but I would rather pay the price that I was used to paying. Very disappointed with my purchase
1.0,Too big and no elastic band stretch
1.0,"These earrings were so small the only person that could possibly wear them would be a baby.. Couldn't believe it.. Not even worth the little bit of money. So sorry, but they were tiny."
1.0,Small and cheap looking but needed it for stage oerfy
1.0,Not chiffon- polyester blend horrible do t buy
1.0,"Had a hard time opening the snap lock. Once I got it open to remove packing material & examine the wallet, the outer cover tore in 3 places like delicate thin paper. Shame really, because I loved the multiple pockets for all your items."
1.0,Absolutely the cheapest piece of crap socks I ever bought. Horrible! Don't get these they are cheap thin and completely garbage
1.0,So cheap and poorly made wouldn’t let my  hold wear
1.0,"Very pretty BUT,  the slots are too small to get get your cards in and out easily.  I would have sent it back but I didn't feel it was worth the postage.<br />Very disappointed."
1.0,Too small. Very heavy
1.0,I really wanted these boots. Something about<br />the color and the distressed look that caught my eyes. They arrived looking like they had been worn. I was going to replace them with the same boot. I decided not to.
1.0,"The fabric is cheap! Same type a fabric you find in a Halloween costume. I guess I got what I paid for. Next time I will just go with Z-Supply brand and pay the extra money for the quality I am looking for. Only positive side to it is it did have a nice fit to it, I bought a size small."
1.0,"I am so disappointed. I bought 4 sets for my family (myself, my husband and 2 daughters) for our Christmas family pictures and to be used thereafter. The design is adorable but they are ruined after you wash them. I will say that they fit true to size, which is why I gave one star. Right out of the package or directly off the rack, most clothing feels a little stiff and has that package/store smell. I wanted to soften the PJs and rid them of that ""new"" smell, so I read the product care label and the instructions say ""wash separately, professional dry cleaning recommended"".  First off, maybe I am alone, but I have NEVER sent my PJs to the dry cleaner and found it strange this recommendation was on the label. Second, dry cleaning was only a recommendation and not listed as the only method for cleaning. I washed the pants separately (as stated on the label), in cold water and hung them up to dry.T They turned out fine. I followed the same procedure for the shirts. RUINED!  The shirts are now splotchy with residue from the die that was used for the black sleeves.  What a disappointment and waste of money."
1.0,Received this shirt with aa white bleached stain on the back..
1.0,"The left eye of the mask was peeling off!!! Used it for my son's birthday party, had to manage it and fix it myself."
1.0,Jacket looks cute but is really cheap feeling. Fits like a slightly stylish but very cheaply made track jacket. Not lined and not structured.
1.0,Cheaply made. Polyester. Sizing tag was upside down.
1.0,"Not worth the price. Very, very cheap material, and the size runs small. Have to pay for return shipping, which is ridiculous. Don't waste your time with these shirts or brand."
1.0,dress is cute but no ribbons on the front to lace up and even tho I lost weight AND ordered a size up it was massively too small. I will have to return it
1.0,"Feels cheap, like a $10 watch. I quit wearing it after a week when the dye from the watch band started wearing off on my wrist. If I had bought it from Amazon I would send it back."
1.0,Very disappointed chain is broken part is missing😖😡
1.0,The shoe size was mislabeled<br />It was 2 sizes too big<br />My granddaughter was so disappointed that they didn't fit
1.0,"After 2 weeks, the rocks fall off"
1.0,Complete junk. Sells on wish for $1. Don't waste your money. You can find better quality at dollar store.
1.0,It says it was a large us and xl in Id didn’t realize two different sizes and it’s like a medium us be sure to look at the sizes before you order
1.0,"This does not look like the photo at all.  I ordered the black lace in XXL and the sleeves are much narrower and it's MUCH shorter in overall length than the photo.  Like, a whole foot shorter.  What a joke.  I'm so tired of these false advertising photos.  At least Amazon Prime makes returns a breeze."
1.0,"My body is too big for these, and my legs too long as well. Please buy three sizes bigger than what you wear."
1.0,Don't ever buy this it is the tiniest piece of rock I've ever seen. I am SOOOOO angry DO NOT BUY FROM THIS ROCK PARADISE EVR!!! IT IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF AND SCAM! THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!
1.0,"I don't know what it is about this shirt, but, it adds pound to anyone that its it on.  Even my smaller friends look bigger in it."
1.0,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! FEEL LIKE I WAS WEARING RAIN PROOF GEAR, WILL NEVER WEAR THIS DRESS OUT"
1.0,"Will turn your fingers green after a few hours of wear. As usual, photo looks appealing, but the actual product is quite the opposite."
1.0,I took a chance despite the reviews and bought an xlarge. I am 5 ft. 125 lbs and it was still too small. I had the worst camel toe wearing this.  This is not made like a Brazilian bottom at all. Take everyones reviews seriously and don't buy this.
1.0,"Snap came off immediately.  Also, clip set too low for pocket."
1.0,Very cheap material like a dollar store quality really light weight almost like sprayed on plastic chain
1.0,Only a 4 stitch hat with cheap fishing line for thread. Save your money. Should have picked up an 8 stitch hat.
1.0,My son is a size 12 and i got him a 12.5 just in case ... they’re VERY small. They’re so tight. Which stinks bc he really likes them. The lights also don’t work. ... the wheels work well and the show is thick. Wish it was better because it really is a cool looking shoe
1.0,"Super cute and fit well, the one time she got to wear them. I thought maybe it was one color, but it was every single one. Bummer. Waste of money and shipping."
1.0,There was a piece of clear plastic tape that was nearly impossible to remove. When I did it left a track in the favric. The robe pilled up in jusy one wash. I would NOT recommend this product. It’s poor quality for the price.
1.0,Clasp is worthless.....would loose this in 10 min :(
1.0,When they finally came most of them were broken.
1.0,the chains were irregular length and did not drape like the picture
1.0,"I purchased the two package black racerback tees last year [2015] in May.  The original pair were made in Cambodia.  The pattern was a good fit for me.  The dye was of such good quality dark blue tint black that even wash after wash and constant wear both articles still look new.  The material is of medium weight [nice ribbing] and is still in perfect shape.  It's lost none of it's elasticity and the stitching is still in tact.  These were of very good quality.  The product you sent me this year [March 14, 2016] was made in China.  The dye has a brownish tinge and is of very poor quality [barely a black at all].  The pattern is cut completely different.  The material is thinner, the stitching deplorable, altogether a very inferior product. And yet you charge me the same amount and hope I'm satisfied with your decision to cut corners and make a cheaper product in a country known for it's inhuman work conditions and questionable chemical uses."
1.0,The sizing is WAY off!!!  And the shoe itself doesn't have a good fit after finally getting the right size via guessing on 3 different orders.  the &#34;tongue&#34; of the shoe is so lose that they won't stay on my sons feet.
1.0,Can't wear with anything semi low cut. Shows through  shirts. I would not recommend
1.0,Absolutely not like the picture. The mask is 2d with eye cut outs. Made in felt and is bent.
1.0,"This shirt fits terribly. I'm big chested, showed no curves and made me look pregnant. It's tight in the top area and too loose in the bottom. The sleeves are belled so it looks like bell bottoms on your arms. So ugly that I returned."
1.0,From reviews and pictures i thought this would be a mini dress but it was down below my knees and it was large like a potatoe bag.<br />And the pink is not bright at all like on the pictures so returning it!:(
1.0,Good material but very cheap. The strap broke immediately and the dress is super short. I ordered a small and It fit my body but was extremely short. I’m 5’6 and the dress came right under my butt so if I even moved my butt would show. It’s a shame because the dress is cute.
1.0,Way to lose. Not true to size. Feels more like a 4x
1.0,"If there was an option to rate less than one star I would.. I bought two of these one for my girlfriend who is a nursing student and one for her best friend who is also a nursing student.. These seem to be exactly what they needed, it has military time and an indigo Both watches have completely quit working within two months of the purchase.. At first they would periodically stop and you could get it to start again by resetting the time. But now they will not work at all.  I took my girlfriends to a watch repair man to see if it just needed new batteries.. But the repair man told me all THREE yes THREE batteries were good. He said he wasn't for sure what was wrong with it but advised me that it would probably cost more to fix it then what I had paid for it.. So now I/we have bought her a new watch and we are stuck with this one that is useless.. Her friend's is in the exact same condition I am very disappointed I've never in the 6 years I've been making purchases from Amazon bought a product that I was so disappointed in.. I just want everyone else out there to be aware of this issue and please do not waste your money.. This is just a piece of junk you would be better off to buy a watch from Wal-Mart .."
1.0,Material is very flimsy.
1.0,Doesn’t wash well
1.0,Poor quality feathers are coming out don’t spend your money on this jacket
1.0,The top i got is orange. Looks NOTHING like this. I don’t like doing online returns because i don’t have time or energy to do all that but I’m really disappointed this isn’t what it was advertised as. Thank goodness I hadn’t bought shoes based off that picture. The material even looks different.
1.0,Almost threw up when took a bite!  Didn't even taste like cola.  It tasted like bubble gum.
1.0,"I just could not wear these. Too heavy and cheap looking. I know they're inexpensive, I just thought that they would look different."
1.0,"It was a little on the small side, and did a terrible job wicking the water off."
1.0,This this is not a Japan import!!!!!!!!  The last numbers or DR  not JF get your info right Le Watcherie. I like the watch but it would have been nice to get a Japan import
1.0,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this blouse. It looks so so so bad because the stripes do not line up. They didn’t even try to line them up. Also, it runs large. I normally wear a medium and I definitely needed a small. I hope I learned a lesson to read the reviews."
1.0,Didn’t work for me. Gave me a bad rash I’m still having to deal with.
1.0,Wow... it showed up completely ripped at the neck line....<br />where is the quality control ?!
1.0,"The plastic end that the belt weaves through has just one plastic bar, so the belt weaves through loosely and is impossible to tighten around your waist, which makes the bucket worthless on any sort of pack."
1.0,Disappointed with this top. I returned it. It was so cheaply made & see through. Do not recommend!
1.0,These were totally worthless to me. They do not stay on my glasses at all!
1.0,"Fit weirs, but most of all this shirt was U.G.L.Y!!!!  I swear the picture just doesn't match, I mean this thing is like your grandmothers moo moo, but in shirt form."
1.0,Does not help with night vision
1.0,"Do not buy, the pin snapped it's head off. JUNK."
1.0,"Way way way too small. I ordered a XL and it fit like a legitimate XS. Its extremely irritating, so unless you are tiny, i dont recomend this product at all."
1.0,"If you want these, go to the dollar store. Flimsy and cheap."
1.0,The board was huge but unfortunately there was a lot of wasted space. I've bought smaller boards in the past that were much easier to see and stickers seemed bigger. I would never buy this item again.
1.0,XL is barely a kids size 8-10
1.0,They are not clear lenses very difficult to see through
1.0,The tree just fell off the second day wearing it :(  Disappointed.  Not sure we can fix it.  This was not while putting it on or taking it off-- It just fell off.
1.0,The clasp doesn't stay closed. I already lost my heart charm not realizing it was open.
1.0,It was too small and uncomfortable
1.0,The worse cheap material.... quality is bad... just got it out the bag without tags looks is been used and doesn’t have a size/ tag in the back of neck as usually see it with all the clothing....
1.0,This stress wasn't anything like the picture.<br />It comes in the shape of a tent. The belt or robe tie is so skinny it does not hold shape to the garnment.  Is not flattering on any body.
1.0,"This item made me so mad!  I bought these for my 3 yr old for when we headed to Monster Jam.  I didn't really have any other use for them so when the day came, I expected them to work.  Granted, my son was taking them on and off the whole show but they only lasted for 2 rounds and one of the ear pieces fell off and wouldn't stay attached back (just kept falling off).  Of course I didn't have a backup pair so I gave him mine but they were big on him so he couldn't get comfortable with them on so we left the show early.  Very disappointing"
1.0,"I  ordered according to the size chart provided for the xompnay. It still needs to be a size larger. Also,It is very thin and already the threads are unraveling."
1.0,Cheap piece of crap. DO NOT BUY. Very little pressure will break these. Not worth a quarter.
1.0,Liked style. Prefer wrinkle free cotton fabric
1.0,It's too large and hurting my son's feet thanks.
1.0,Did not hold shape during shipping. Looks nothing like picture.
1.0,"Packed  it back up and returned it as soon as I looked at it. Pictured is a rectangular bag, with a matte finish. What showed up was a square shiny bag with what looked like a design hot glued to it."
1.0,It is too small and never would fit the model in the picture. It is also made out of very cheap material. Not really worth the $.
1.0,The product had the screen print reversed and was unwearable
1.0,"I only got three and it was too small. Tried to return but seller states I need to keep it because its to expensive to return and I'm stuck with it. Ended with ""Have a happy life"". Huh??? Sketchy"
1.0,"I really  loved this shoe ..very cool designs and  variety of changing led lights ..reviews were overall  pretty solid so i decided to give them a try .. and they were a hit ..my son loved them and insisted on wearing them same day even though they seemed a bit too big on him ..he didn't care..unfortunetly not even after couple of hours of wearing,  the left shoe completely stopped working ..one of the tiny cables came off and i wasn't able to fix it .. ..they have been in the closet for past couple of months since  i didn't think i can return them after he already wore them out  ..so my advice is ..save yourself a headache or at least know what u r getting yourself into ..a moment of your kids happiness  then just to be overshadowed with  a complete disappointment ..oh and the monetery loss on top of it all ..not wort it"
1.0,One end does not fit into the watch. Will be returning it. Other than that I actually liked the band a lot.
1.0,Very cheap and didn't fit at all.  Doesn't look like the model.  Returned.
1.0,Dice que el producto fue entregado y no es así
1.0,It didn’t say it was just one earring not the pair
1.0,Too small. Not good quality
1.0,Way to big and cheaply made.
1.0,It shrunk after washing it
1.0,Very hard to release...
1.0,"Absolutely terrible quality. So cheesy. Made in China and you can tell! Even for the price, I'd rather spend the extra money and buy a good purse! I have found a purse 10x better than this one at WALMART for 7$. Thats saying something. The inside feels like paper rather than cloth and the outside had stains all over it upon opening the package. Trust me don't waste your money."
1.0,This broke after I wore it twice. The three strands keep getting caught in each other and knotting while you wear it. It's a cheap necklace but it broke before I got to wear it much.
1.0,The mini had several chips on it should have been listed as bad not good!
1.0,Doesn’t look like picture. The slip fabric is super cheap but The worst part is that it didn’t looked like a night gown. In the picture it shows that it gets tight under the chest and it definitely doesn’t. I will be returning.
1.0,It was not the shorts described! I have them to good will!  They were high rise  and made of a material that was not the denim I am used too!  Guess you get what you pay for but even that was too much!
1.0,"This bra comes down too low in the front. I spent my entire workout adjusting it. It seems like it was made to be cute and sporty, when I’m just looking for functional while working out."
1.0,Bad quality. 'Stick' arrived broken. Back side is flat. 'Sticks' are VERY thin. Would not recommend. Product pictures are very deceiving.
1.0,The material is made from cheap fibers. They pill/ lint balls in minutes of wear.
1.0,"Terrible, my son wore it once on a playground for maybe an hour max and the strap already broke off.  Will be wanting a refund.  Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"The red high waist area is way too tight with no stretch at all. There is a zipper on the side, but that is totally ineffective because it's just too small. I ordered a size up to 2XL just in case, so I was surprised it didn't fit well! The rest of the fabric seemed nice enough."
1.0,Don’t waste your time or money. They are not true to size. I ordered and XS and they literally came three sizes to big. I gave them to my sister and she is a large and she said they felt like a medium. Sizing is seriously off. Definitely not a product worth buying. I literally never write reviews but I was so frustrated when I received them and don’t want this to happen to anyone else.
1.0,I ordered these for my fiance who works at the local animal shelter as I knew she would love them and wearing them to work would be cute. The box arrived and it was EMPTY just a little empty box with a label that claimed it had cat earrings in it.
1.0,Quality is not good. The material is thin and very cheapy.
1.0,"Clasp broke in first few weeks of ownership. This was embarrassing as it was a gift for a friend, and I trusted the other reviews, as they were promising a solid product."
1.0,not worth it! very cheap!
1.0,Some con fusion here. I did not order any sweat bands
1.0,"I ordered this top after reading the reviews and looking at the photos underneath of seemingly normal sized people wearing this top and looking really cute. I am a size 6 and am 5 foot 10 and I ordered a LARGE and it still does not fit at all.It is tight and short. It is way way too small and doesn't even look like the top in this photo. I know it was only 15 dollars and cheaply made, but, I really liked the top on the model and I am very disappointed with this top. I will be sending it back."
1.0,I ordered a medium and tried on the bathing suit top as soon as the package arrived. While trying it on the bathing suit IMMEDIATELY broke right in the middle. I never even got a chance to see how it looked. I couldnt imagine if I had brought it on vacation with me without trying it on. I have fairly small frame so it was not a sizing issue just CHEAPLY and POORLY made. Very disappointed in this product DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Wasn't a real blazer, it's a jersey jacket."
1.0,"I ordered a in my size, but they were too small and split all the way down the leg the first time I wore them! Not worth it!"
1.0,The material is thin and see through. The shoulder detail is stiff. Seller is crazy and I had to make a claim to actually get my money back. Waste of time and money. Lesson learned...dont buy cheap clothes on amazon
1.0,"If I could rate this product with negative stars...it would be -10 stars!!<br />Product showed up inside out, with cat (or dog) hair all over it. Totally disgusting! Not to mention the holes in parts of the seams and the oder.<br />I definitely RETURNED!!"
1.0,if I could give it zero stars I would. It was too tight in the bust but loose everywhere else. The fabric is so heavy it stretches out the top. Very cheap-looking material. Way too expensive for the quality you're getting.
1.0,I even ordered up 2 sizes and it doesn't fit around my cheat. I already washed so I can't return.
1.0,So I was excited to get this and see how it'd fit but it's awful. It's cute and all but it doesn't look like the pics or fit well either. I'd go with something else other than this top.
1.0,Poor quality. Money clip very stiff. Tried to widen it but it would hold money. I would recommend
1.0,This item was supposed to be a plus-size item and fit like a xsmall.
1.0,The zipper is cheap and there's a hole. It's made cheap and looks cheap. Don't waste your money
1.0,Nice looking belt but very flimsy. You get what you pay for... belt was very inexpensive and the product reflects just that... Cheap... The front side is nice and looks like leather but the back side is definitely some kinda plastic or rubber.  This belt may not last long at all...
1.0,Went straight back.. the triangles on large could fit American girl doll
1.0,"VERY SHEER!! bought white, you can see through, and there is a ""lining"" that looks like you have a pair of shorts underneath ! very, very sheer! terrible!!! sent back.  Also, NOT linen.... silky material, almost like a slip"
1.0,The size is not accurate at all!! Way smaller than what they should be!!
1.0,"Never ordering anything again very disappointed, I should have known better it looks nothing like the photo two different items 😡😡😡😡"
1.0,So uncomfortable I had to return them
1.0,Zipper broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,very unhappy
1.0,I bought the gray one and the jacket I received was much lighter than advertised. The cut of the jacket I received is nowhere near as flattering as advertised.
1.0,Doesn’t look like the picture. Very cheaply crafted.V ery cheap unflattering look quite embarrassing to wear!
1.0,"Nothing like what is shown, weird shape, odd fitted arm holes, awful stitching and just overall AWFUL"
1.0,looks like something you'd get at the dollar store.
1.0,I need a size 9.5 but because am a woman. I am only able to buy either a size 9 or 10. Not one that fits my foot.
1.0,The shoulder strap ripped off with a piece of bag material after a few uses.
1.0,Sizes are Chinese sizes. If you want the correct is order 3 sizes bigger! Ordered xxxl and they don't even fit my son who wears Large
1.0,Didn’t like the flat style so gave away to my niece. Looks cheap
1.0,"The earings are not 'tear shaped', they look like chewed gum."
1.0,"I was SO excited to get this jacket, the picture is gorgeous! The jacket is pictured with all silver color hardware. The jacket I received would be PERFECT with all silver color hardware. Instead, it has *gunmetal grey zipper pulls* attached to *brown brass zippers* with *black studs*. It all looks very odd. I love the jacket but need one that has silver hardware like what was pictured. I NEVER would have wasted my time and tied up my $$$ on a black leather jacket with brown zippers, even if they were all the same color. The worst part is that they couldn't even settle on a single color hardware, but put THREE DIFFERENT COLORS on the same item. It looks plain awful. I included several pictures of the actual item I received to help anybody decide if they would want to order such a thing, at any price...I wouldn't pay $10 for this with all the different color hardware on it. The leather jacket itself is wonderful, but the mismatched hardware ruin the look of the jacket entirely."
1.0,Some of the stones were the wrong color
1.0,"I didn’t have high expectations for the price.  The mask was flimsy plastic and the left side was cracked.  We didn’t use it and had to make a last minute change and find an alternative costume.  We managed to find something better, but this mask was tossed out. They only get 1 star because of the fast shipping and cheap price."
1.0,Trash
1.0,Belt is not even close to the correct size!
1.0,Horrible buy and cheap material
1.0,Not the material I was specting
1.0,The material was very nice and the size was accurate but the color was not as shown in the picture. It was very frustrating cause I ordered this color for work and it wasn't even close to being the dark shade as shown above.
1.0,Shorts fit but shirt was too small
1.0,Solo 1 personaje al azar es y no 4 como muestra la imagen.
1.0,"I should have listened to the reviews. The quality of this shirt is AWFUL! There is loose and uneven stitching all over. The fit is nothing like the picture. I am approximately the same size as the woman in the image and it fits so goofy. It's not as long (definitely not long enough to wear with leggings), the neck is way too wide, the torso is super wide and baggy, and the sleeves are too short. It's seriously the weirdest fitting shirt. For the record, I'm 5'8&#34; and 135 pounds, and I got a large."
1.0,Unfortunately they were bigger and heavier than I wanted.  I will most likely return them.
1.0,I was so disappointed in the irregular sizing from one pair to the next in the same package. Plus the stitching pulled apart after first wash. We held up one pair to my daughters size smalls and my xxl's were the same size. Ridiculous.
1.0,IT CAME IN A TINY BOX ALL FOLDED UP WITH CREASES EVERWHERE<br />I tried to iron it but it was too much work I just returned it.
1.0,"The color was definitely more brown than olive.  The words did not stand out as well as in the picture.  Very loose.  I am thin and have no curves, but generally like muscle tanks.  However, this felt like I was wearing a sack."
1.0,I love this romper! However I purchased my normal size because other reviews said it was true to size and it was sooooo small. Almost like an extra small. A little disappointed but don’t let this stop you from purchasing it! Maybe size up!
1.0,I bought and August and just pulled out the final pair from my pack and there’s a huge rip. Of course it’s the pair I wanted the most.
1.0,I wear 14 pants so I ordered the XXL.  The bottoms are elastic and look like a size 4 in the waist!!!  They do fit but not<br />a comfortable sleep in fit....the cami and robe fit.
1.0,"Looks decent, Feels cheap. Tools included was convenient."
1.0,"I received this ring today, and it is not like what is shown in the advertisement. Do not waste your time."
1.0,These are falling apart after 10 days of use at work. All of the “gripping” material is ripped or falling off.
1.0,"I always thought that Sorel was a quality brand. That is why I purchased these boots. When I took them out of the box and looked them over. My first disappointment was that they were made in China. My mistake. I kept them because I needed boots right away. In less than 2 years time the rubber was dry rotted and rendered the boots useless around water. Go with L.L.Bean Boot, made in Maine since 1912."
1.0,"See through material and fairly ugly color. One of about a half dozen dresses that I'm returning because of flimsy, see through material."
1.0,Bottoms are too small. Top fits. Have to return it.
1.0,They are NOT BiFocals!!!!
1.0,"This item is a poor ripoff made with stolen art, please do not buy it"
1.0,Broke after 2 howers of waring around the house
1.0,When product arrived pump was open and didn’t work.
1.0,This sweater is flimsy and bleeds badly.  Do not buy!
1.0,Finish cracked after one week of normal wear
1.0,I really liked the look of this band for my watch but the magnets have not held up at all. Would not recommend this and I have already bought a different band for my Apple Watch.
1.0,Looks very and feels  cheap
1.0,Wayy tooo big
1.0,Cultural appropriation needs to stop!!!
1.0,Slippers become especially slippery when they meet water.
1.0,These shoes were advertised as women shoes. They are not. They are much to large and extremely wide. I gave them away.
1.0,very cute looking but not practical. runs way to wide. perfect if you had a fat foot though...
1.0,Opened it and put it on and it broke apart. Terrible and was not offered a refund and return
1.0,Gave as a gift and was surprised to see the ruby fell out of the earring.
1.0,"I typically don’t review much of anything but this was worth a review. You’re wasting your money if you order this, it’s nothing but pure junk. It doesn’t suction well at all and if you try to suck the air out, as it states, you’ll almost suck it down your throat. I’m going to try and return it."
1.0,"Not for my big face. Looked silly and was cheap looking. Not sturdy, frames felt flimsy. Returned."
1.0,"I really liked the heavyness of the material. Several other products I have bought are made out of a sort of silky material so it was nice to have more of a canvas like fabric that felt durable. Unfortunately, after washing the 1st time the black fabric faded pretty significantly to a very worn gray color. It looks like it has been well used after the 1st wash."
1.0,"Should have read through reviews rather than looking at star rating. Company is obviously doing something shifty as reviews for this SANTA SUIT i bought talk about sleeping bag liners, scarves, and other random non-santa related items. SO... if you're thinking of  buying this Santa suit for something OTHER than a bar crawl or reenacting Jonathan Taylor Thomas' &#34;I'll be home for Christmas&#34; (it looks cheap and dirty like His did after being stranded in the desert)... DONT. The jacket runs small, the pants run HUGE... LIke really HUGE, the hat is tiny- may fit a child tiny. The beard is not at all what is advertised it's pathetic and there is no wig but you couldn't fit a cheap wig under the tiny pathetic hat. I realize I bought a cheap Santa suit, but the pictures and what you get do not match at all! So beware what you're getting."
1.0,I purchased these for my boyfriend for his work uniform and the bottom clip slips and popped him in the nuts!
1.0,"This didn't look anything like the picture, it's light grey, cheap and not form fitting."
1.0,They were missing the nose pieces! Had to send them back! Not sure how that was missed but very disappointing.
1.0,I couldn’t even wear more than 2/3 times it broke
1.0,I returned this item because it was not sized correctly.  Its XL was more like a small.
1.0,they’re good rings beside the fact that they turn your fingers green after a while
1.0,"The colors are vibrant but the material is not very good, The size was more like a 1X not a 3X.  The threading on the elastic top breaks real easy."
1.0,Material is cheap and wearing out after just a couple of times wearing.
1.0,Sent it back.  Ran small
1.0,On of the slippers ripped about thirty minutes after my 9 year old put them on.
1.0,"Mask is too large, odd shape, doesn't look like voldemort.  Photo is misleading."
1.0,I thought this was a bigger toy
1.0,"These feel too tight and constricting on my normal width feet. Also thinner than I thought they’d be, but that could be my mistake not reading description enough. My husband has some nice Darn Tough socks and I was looking for the women’s version. These are not it."
1.0,"The description said blue, but they were really purple."
1.0,"Product says it darkens in the sun. Bull ,set them in direct sunlight for an hour never even got a little darker. Waste of money!"
1.0,Horrible. Fits to big and has nothinh to do with the pictured one
1.0,All zippers broke on first use
1.0,Thin scratchy material. Feels very cheap.
1.0,Material is cheap not what it appear to be on the picture.one was and it came apart .looks like it came from China
1.0,"Fits great, but doesn't block out the sun,  and you see different color,  cars changing colors from purple to red black yellow and other colors"
1.0,"Opened the package and packed it back up immediately for return. Fabric is very thin and poor quality. The body of the shirt is way too short for the length of the sleeves. Cannot recommend at all. On the positive side, the seller provides a return label for the return shipment."
1.0,"Very small, cheap material  and poorly made"
1.0,Too tight on my wife's wrist
1.0,"the description states ""Gloves for Men"" - I ordered 2XL for a man and they are a size med/large for a woman.<br />they do seem like nice gloves if you need them for an average size woman."
1.0,I don’t feel like this looks like the picture at all. You can’t call those royal blue that’s just blue
1.0,This is a really cute ring but it is so hard to open I had to use pliers. It was just as hard to close. The size is perfect for a smaller septum ring but being that small I can't exactly stick pliers in my nose to get it on and off. Definitely disappointed I can't use it.
1.0,This broke the second time worn.
1.0,poor material. im around 5'5 to 5'6 and cup size c. this DEFINITELY DOESNT FIT IF YOU'RE BUSTY
1.0,Incredibly ugly and cheap looking. Photo does not represent how ugly this thing is. I'm saving it for holloween next year.
1.0,The package and website shows removable pads. There are not removable pads or a place to put them. Returning!
1.0,funny boobs and not comfortable
1.0,En una semana pierden el dorado y se ponen feos la foto es una cosa y la realidad otra.
1.0,Poor quality & arrived bent/damaged
1.0,"Thought I was getting a ‘normal’ t shirt & mehhhh. The cut is unflattering to me, it’s not as short as a crop top but for a mother of 4 😅 It’s wide & short."
1.0,The rings are very ruff
1.0,This watch sucked and not only died in the week I first bought. It would not take any new batteries. It  also fell the hell apart for no reason at all CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!
1.0,"I received my kit almost a month ago, and finally had a chance to open it and found that the items I needed the most for an upcoming event were missing but too late to replace in time for my event. This is very inconvenient since this kit is pretty pricey, but now does not save me any money because I still have to buy the remaining items that I did not receive. There is a note in the description that this kit was updated for 2020, but if this was part of the changes, it should of stated so in the list of items as I would not have purchased based on comparing the prices of buying individually.<br /><br />MISSING/INCORRECT:<br />-2 Skid Out deodorant, makeup, and drool remover sponges<br />-4 pieces Sticky Bottoms<br />-4 Chick Magnets<br />-10 pieces Garment Guard 6 beige & 4 black (I received 10 beige, but no black)<br /><br />REPLACED WITH:<br />-Heel Seals sole savers<br />-Strap Trap bra clips<br />-Sole Glow clean & shine sponge for leather/shoes (this is very oily/greasy even though in a zip lock bag)"
1.0,"I really wanted to like this but it didn't fit right on my long torso (I'm 5'9""). Even if it had fit right, the cutouts on the side show your bra which isn't cute. Sent it back."
1.0,Basically 2 pieces of plastic and an elastic not worth the price at all
1.0,I saw a review that said they ran small so I ordered a size 11 which were too big. I then ordered a10 which were too small. I wore thev11with two pairs of thick hiking socks
1.0,"Not wide enough , want say in place"
1.0,after being worn 3 times they completely split but of course the return window  closed. Not worth the price paid!
1.0,Band were to small try getting new one but did not get any responses...
1.0,"This was WAYYYYY too small.  Like I couldn’t even move my arms in it.  I couldn’t get the two sides to cover 1-2 thirds of my chest.  I ordered an XL and it felt like a 4.  It’s really a shame cause it looked like it would have been really cute too.  I almost think I was sent the wrong thing.  I admit I’m like a 12-14 in a shirt, and part of me felt that it might be a little snug, but this was just bizarre - comical, even!  The one thing I can say was done objectively well about this top was how strong the seams were.  Then again, they’d have to be, I suppose, in order to survive a lifetime of confused customers yanking the hell out of it, wondering why it won’t even make it around their body.  Would probably make an excellent straight jacket... then again, I’ve seen people with more mobility in one of those than this button down shirt."
1.0,Waste of money the silver ones changes color.
1.0,Left them outside after the pool and they SHRANK
1.0,"Basically a bag with the hsnd symbol of the KKK. If you're a white nationalist, thisnis the bag for you!"
1.0,The inside is not made properly and I felted the bottom coming apart when I was trying them on. I am very disappointed that the return is not the normal amazon procedure. I have to print return label and also pay for return. Not worth the price
1.0,Awful. Poor poor quality. Button in the back was missing completely new out of the package. Front pocket sewn on inside out. Covered in pulls within first 5 minutes of wearing and doing literally nothing. Extremely unbreathable. Felt like I was sleeping wrapped in a trash bag. These are going back ASAP.
1.0,The product is MUCH smaller than advertised
1.0,"These leggings do not fit plus size gals. I bought the recommended size and it was not correct. These are not high rise either. If you need inexpensive leggings in a pinch these may work if you size up but I wouldnt reccomend it. These are in no way shapping either and they are thin and see through. I should have followed my instincts and stayed away from a product that says ""fat"" in the discription. Do not buy if you are a plus size gal."
1.0,Very bad  terrible
1.0,I purchased two sets and on both sets the stitching came undone . Very disappointed with this product both were only used once. I wish I could return them and get my money back.
1.0,"Very cheap looking denim, nothing like the picture. Weird stretchy fabric. The pants are too short if you’re taller than 5’3. Returned."
1.0,"Had to send back, actual size was much smaller than chart.  You need to order a size up from your actual size"
1.0,"The mannequin head used to model this hat is very small, leading one to think that this hat is larger than it actually is. The cap part barely fits onto my head, and the hat will not provide screening as expected. The bill has been folded over for shipment and now it wont straighten and is pointed at the top. Cheaply made with flimsy fabric."
1.0,This was a piece of plastic garbage
1.0,"I ordered size 9, as that's my usual size, and this slipper was too short.<br />When you stood up on them they had tiny little points that came up under feet,<br />I suppose for circulation, but they hurt my feet. They are a nice looking shoe,<br />but not for me. I wanted to use the as a house slipper. I need the support."
1.0,Although they were nice they would not stay up ! Had to constantly pull them up !
1.0,Nunca los recibí
1.0,i always trusted wigwam for comfortable socks. These sock have a large ball of material atthe toe. I cant wear them no one seems able or willing to make one decent sock
1.0,It was a funny concept but it didn't work on me.  Don't know if it was to big for my face or the material to flimsy.  But this did not work at all.
1.0,"I gave it one star because I wanted my opinion posted.<br />WARNING:  Be careful.  It says &#34;One Size Fits All&#34; but that is not the case, more like &#34;One Size May Fit Your Second Grader&#34;. Granted, i am tall. 5' 9&#34; and 175. Also, it came tattered and pilly, as if someone took scissors to ALL the edges and wanted it to look as beat up as possible.  Strange.  It twas returned."
1.0,"The material feels very cheap.  The stitching on the inside is amateur.  The red is not as pictures.  Instead of being a maroon, this is a bright red.  Returned - you can get much better quality for your money."
1.0,IT DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE PICTURES. I mean NOTHING! Read the reviews! They don’t lie!
1.0,Almost impossible to wear the top and it didn’t stay in place so I had to unfortunately return
1.0,"This is a terrible hat. Top stands too tall, terrible stitching on top.<br />Save your money."
1.0,I returned. WAY TOO SMALL! size up. And the fabric felt very cheap like a cape costume material.
1.0,The bottom of the leg is wide and night right on the leg making it look like a boutique bottom
1.0,Looks cheap and not well made. Seams poorly finished.
1.0,Too small for my bust
1.0,Didn't fit the measurements at all
1.0,"This umbrell a was a Easter gift for my daughter who is 6.  It did not survive the day.  It looked as though the top rivets were not even connected, so once you unfolded and refolded it, you had all these loose wires going every which way.  Total garbage.  I could not repair it although &#34;repair&#34; is a stretch, more like I could not assemble-what-was-never-properly-assembled-to-begin-with....."
1.0,To small. Got refund
1.0,This base metal necklace set turned black during my first time wearing it.  I tried to wear this with some real gold jewelry but it looked cheap and fake from the get go.  Save your money and buy vermeil or 10k gold if you want an inexpensive piece of jewelry.
1.0,This shirt doesn’t look anything like the picture. I bought A small and it’s huge
1.0,I ordered a large but the sleeves were way too long. I returned it.
1.0,Looks and feels cheap. Bought 2 by mistake...should have been just 1. Gave my daughter one and I kept one. The display is not as  brilliant as in the photos and the time no longer is properly or clearly displayed. I am dubious of the waterproof claim. My older Casio watches are crisper than this watch and does not feel as cheap.
1.0,Just got this pack of lights and nearly half of the 40 were not functional.  Very poor quality control.
1.0,"Flimsy and cheap, too big"
1.0,"Broke after a week, junk do not buy."
1.0,No support whatsoever! Only one thin layer of rubber reels like your barefoot! I honestly hope they make a better version of this boot in the future with a better outsole and insole.
1.0,Cheesy bracelet. Not adjustable enough. Clasp didn’t hold.
1.0,This broke the 1st week of normal wear
1.0,Not even 2 months since I got and is already broke just for using it every day.
1.0,Item was broke
1.0,"The were too, too long."
1.0,Arrived broken :(
1.0,"Nice, but lense is scratched already, and I've been very careful to consistently put in soft cover.<br />Update, they broke after 1 month of wearing them. Out of frustration I threw them away.  Consequently,  I was unable to receive refund."
1.0,This was a complete waste of money!  There is no support fits awkward not as pictures at all.
1.0,Did not reduce night vision. Did not work like claimed to work ...
1.0,Its a woman's watch.  The ad did not say that it was a woman's watch.  I returned the item.
1.0,The sizes are way off ordered a XL it still couldn't fix.
1.0,And i could not return it and it still sits in the bag in my closet
1.0,CHEAP... INACCURATE DESCRIPTION
1.0,They did not make any difference in his eyesite. didn't adjust as much as we thought.
1.0,Ordered a large. Doesn't even fit my 102 lb daughter
1.0,"This mask isn't even white like the picture shows, it's a baby blue color. Horrible. I returned."
1.0,"About 2 sizes to small, don’t waste your money"
1.0,Received incorrect item 😣
1.0,Heavy faded nothing like the picture. What a disappointment. fitted 2 sizes bigger. tacky.
1.0,They move! I wanted to return but I missed the window . The metal ones are better
1.0,I absolutely loved the way that these sunglasses look but I’ve only been wearing them for a bit over a month and the color on the lenses is already coming off. Very disappointing. Unwearable at this point.
1.0,I wear a size 12-14 in pants so just to be safe I ordered a XXL and when I tried putting them on they wouldn’t even go past my thighs.<br /><br />I’m really disappointed they didn’t fit since the material is nice and feels expensive. I will be returning this product
1.0,The stick on lense on one side wasn’t correctly applied retuned item for refund
1.0,I wear a large with all my shirts and sweaters. You may need to buy a size up. Super tight in shoulders
1.0,"The strap was more like a bra strap, my 2 year old did not like it at all, it’s very  uncomfortable."
1.0,"These masks weren’t great. When you stretch the sides to put over ears, they don’t have enough elasticity to come back, so they just end up being too big. They are not durable as all of them have broken after just a few washes. The designs are cute but would not last the school year. Other brands are much better."
1.0,"I’m a fan of cubic zirconia - why pay top dollar when you can have a variety of pieces for a fraction of the cost? Almost no one can tell the difference.<br /><br />Sadly, I was very disappointed in these. I can overlook the silver plating, but the CZs were exceptionally small and lacked any kind of sparkle at all. They just looked cheap and I’ll never wear them.<br /><br />I can only recommend them as “starter earrings” for young girls, IF they are in a situation where no one is going to grab at their hoops."
1.0,fits weird the holes are super weird too and and placed at weird places the texture feels like a loose spandex or a rash guard for swimming it's just overalll not a cute shirt
1.0,"There's a big awkward seem right off center and it's killing me. Besides that, it's thin, it's uncomfortable, the fabric feels like something you should be using for a tent. If I could give negative stars I would. Take my advice."
1.0,Very Very Tiny...1 broke while &#34;trying&#34; to put in my granddaughters ear [4 yrs old]. Won't be able to use!
1.0,Too small--very tight and uncomfortable
1.0,Zipper is located on the left side which is opposite all the other men's coats I've ever worn.  The size runs very small.  I usually wear XL coats and sweatshirts and this XXL raincoat I could barely get it started zipping.
1.0,It didn't meet my expectation at all. It's too tight around the waist. I usually fit in large but I guess this one is made in China and clothes tend to be tailored smaller.
1.0,Quality is terrible for the price. Arrives from china a month and a half later. Terrible quality - looks like a robe.
1.0,I rebought it  be cause my mom loved it ...but the latch won't open..
1.0,"Too short and material is too thick.<br />I am 5' 9"" and these pants are too short by about 8 inches. And the material is like winter clothing."
1.0,XXL in china size which is a XS
1.0,"Very disappointed! I really wanted to like this dress! I’m a small/medium size. I bought a large to be safe.  When I tried it on , it wouldn’t zip and felt very tight. If you purchase make sure you go at least 2 sizes up."
1.0,Horrible. When I got the rings they were broken and the gems had fallen out before I had a chance to wear them for a good day.
1.0,Didn't say in description this was nothing more than a clip on.
1.0,After wearing only once it tore next to the pocket while putting it on.
1.0,"Doesn’t fit, valves broken."
1.0,broken when I received it...=(
1.0,"I was very excited about the shirt because it's hilarious, but it isn't even wearable. It's way too short and wide. The material was soft and the saying is great, but turned out to be a waste of money."
1.0,Writing this review within 2 months of buying this. My son goes swimming once a week so effectively he has worn this max 8-10 times. The color is already fading and the material is seeming to tear off. Unfortunately we are having to look for another swim suit already.
1.0,The sizing was way off. Disappointed!
1.0,"This item was not as show in the picture, the zipper came off immediately. This item was not as show in the picture"
1.0,I just receive my blouse and I agree with other comments. It doesn't look like the picture.
1.0,"The fit was as expected, having said that, there is hardly any cushioning to what is referred to as Memory Foam cushion to the innersoles."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture very small and very dissapointed!
1.0,Post is as thick as a toothpick!
1.0,The skirt was not true to size. I'm a 8-10 and the skirt fit like a 4-6. It was too long also. So disappointed.
1.0,"Do not buy.<br />Terrible fit, cheap quality, and just looks bad.<br />You are better off just buying a dress shirt at Walmart or goodwill. You’ll get better quality…"
1.0,They never warmed up not even a bit  was the worst day of work he has ever had.
1.0,At least 2 sizes too 2
1.0,Product didn’t look like the picture. It had pumpkin orange rhinestones and the Brown wasn’t dark brown.
1.0,"Don't do it. Looks nothing like the picture, cheap quality,  horrible sizing, ordered xl for a friend, so dam tiny might fit young child, style sucks"
1.0,"Very cheaply made, thin material and looks cheap. For almost $30 I would've expected something with thicker material. My daughter loves it so I guess that's all that matters."
1.0,Nothing ! Changed next day after going outside.
1.0,The mask is very thin and flimsy. It's just a soft lace mask. No hard part underneath. Pretty but not what I wanted or thought they were going to be
1.0,Gloves are packed in zip lock. There is no real way to insure that the gloves have not already been open. No actually security. Also they don't go all the way down to the wrist. Super cheap gloves. Sad to see people taking advantage of the covid scare.
1.0,The straps close with Velcro that is very weak and doesn’t stay together while standing or walking. Do not buy these shoes
1.0,I am a size small in everything but this came in and the top was too big and the shorts were way to small! Be careful if your ordering in the us because they will not be able to offer you a full refund. Disappointed in the fit and quality.
1.0,"Was disappointed, felt the picture was misleading as to the actual size of the chain, it's very tiny and lightweight"
1.0,Missing rhinestones and they weren't in the tiny bag meaning they sent it this way. Looked awful!<br />Also ring was not a circle more like an oddly shaped oval.<br />Messaged seller will update response
1.0,"Poor quality overall, poor craftsmanship, strange fit, cheap fabric. Returned item."
1.0,Arrived after Halloween. Plus they were for children
1.0,Poor Quality will return
1.0,I am disappointed . The size of the heart is good but the chain is ripped up it is not possible to wear.
1.0,This product arrived with a nonfunctioning back compartment (the zipper pull was completely detached). It was promptly returned.
1.0,I am not happy with this purchase. The watch stopped working after having it for only 26 days.
1.0,Broke after a few months of having it. I wouldn't buy this again.
1.0,they don't stay on they keep slipping back. Super soft though
1.0,One of the elbow patches was on the front side of the arm. Don’t buy clothes from Amazon.
1.0,Some came in the package broken and then when I put them on they was just falling off.
1.0,"I got these for my daughter for Christmas. She is a huge Harley Quinn fan and in color guard in her high school marching band. When she went to put these on, they were see through. She had to wear another pair of shorts underneath. Then, in the middle of practice, they ripped. So unless you want everyone knowing what color your underwear is, don't buy these expecting to actually use them as active wear."
1.0,The color not as the description. I got a green one.
1.0,Sooooo small
1.0,cheap top
1.0,The material is flimsy and tears easily. I had to order a second one because the first arrived torn. The second dress tore within 2 wears.<br />Definitely do not recommend.
1.0,Wish I can give it -5 starts it's super small wouldn't recommend I got the biggest size don't order it! 😡😡😡
1.0,Item was too small and I expected this so I ordered it in a size twice as large as i usually get and the item was still small.
1.0,I would recommend ordering these a size or two larger than what your true size is.  These jeans ran very small.  I returned them but never received a refund.
1.0,I also received only 4 pairs despite the listing saying 12 pairs.
1.0,This is the worst product ever DO NOT BUY THIS... 1st it’s cheap as hell 2nd it’s smells like hell 3rd YOU CANT BREATH when wearing it.  When you attempt to do a return it’s not eligible for a return.  Now my poor 9year old is out 25$ and can’t even play with the mask he was excited to play with.
1.0,Frustrating to be given the choice of styles only to receive the wrong selection twice.
1.0,Received different dress. No wrist cuffs. No balloon sleeves. No waist-to-leg ruffle. Made in China SCAM.
1.0,Chain is cheap with huge loops. Nothing like it seems in the pictures.
1.0,"I thought these would have a 7 inch inseam they do not, they have about a 9 inch inseam<br />which makes them drop down to right above my knee cap, not good.<br />They fabric is very comfortable and substantial.<br />The inner shorts are very comfortable,  not too tight or too thick.<br />Pockets are very handy to put keys or other small item.<br />I will put these shorts to good use, just wish they would have been shorter."
1.0,They would not stay on and the seller would not refund. Took them to a jeweler and for $125 more had screw backs put on.
1.0,Had to return the fit was too large despite ordering the size as shown.
1.0,It was broken after 3 days!!!!!!!!
1.0,"there is no operating instruction with this item, the item might be ok but I can not tell with no instruction"
1.0,"I ordered one of every size because this was such a great idea. They don’t work. I have an iPhone X and used it (with no case) and the garter kept sliding down from the weight of the phone (which is not heavy at all). No way a phone in a case would be held.<br />Neat concept, needs work."
1.0,"This was a really cute idea; my daughter wanted it so bad. So I bought it for her, and the day after it arrived, the collar clip fell apart. My husband fixed it, and two days later, it fell apart again. The same day, the chain on the necklace literally disintegrated. Crumbled into pieces. Don’t waste your money. It’s really cute. But really just junk. So disappointed."
1.0,Clearly the dress is pink not maroon
1.0,Very poor quality fabric and construction- could not bring myself to leave the house in it let alone wear to a special event.
1.0,Returned-appeared very cheap.
1.0,"These are way too difficult to take apart.  And when you do get one apart from the others, the one you took apart is ruined."
1.0,Sorry these things are a disaster. I bought them to go in my heels I was wearing to a wedding. I initially had doubts after feeling how sticky the adhesive was but pressed ahead anyway. I was driving to the church and could already feel something was wrong. When I arrived I saw one had managed to slide almost completely out of my shoe up the side. I stuck it back in place thinking maybe I hadn't pressed it down hard enough to begin with (I did my shoes the night before so I wouldn't be in a rush on the day.) Sadly it didn't work and now both were loose on the way to the reception I pulled over and tossed them in the trash and put up with rubbing heels and resultant blisters.
1.0,These were not good fell apart. However Revolia did fully refund my purchase and I didnt even ask them but they seem to care
1.0,"I bought an entire cup and band size larger because the reviews suggested it ran small. I was swimming in it. So definitely don’t get a bigger size. Also, not at all sexy. I was hoping for more of a plunge Demi bra, but this completely covers the boobs."
1.0,Minus 5 stars....The metal has turned black....what a disappointment.
1.0,These are ridiculous. The waist was freakishly small and the material was obviously cheap. Returned.
1.0,"No ruffle, not as seen on picture. Not cute. Not happy."
1.0,"Ive bought this item over and over at least 3 times, breaks every time!! 😞"
1.0,Looked good on skinny model...not so much on thick real woman.
1.0,lenses are great..  frame broke in about 10 days..  Ive had 6-8 pair of cheaper glasses purchased on here do the same..  thought stepping up a little in quality would produce better product.....annnd no
1.0,"This might have been the most expensive piece of clothing I've ever bought, so I expected it quite exited, but when the package arrived and I got my hands on it, I felt weirdly dissapointed. It didn't seem luxorious as I had imagined, more like any cheap satin robe. Checked the label since I thought maybe they had accidentaly sent me a polyester version like the other customer told in reviews had happened, but it said 100% silk alright, although not any more specifically. I tried it on and it fit alright, but didn't feel warm on the skin, which was one of my major reasons for choosing a silk fabric instead of cheaper robe options. My suspicions grew so I tried several tests I found, like trying to pull the fabric through a ring or rubbing it between fingers, and it didn't pass any of them. Finally when I noticed a loose thread coming out from the fabric, I pulled it out and tried the burn test. It didn't really burn like silk does, more like melted into a plastic clump. Feeling very disappointed now and not sure if I ever want to buy clothes through mail again."
1.0,"Not only do I have a big head, but I also have a lot of hair. After my favorite (and only) sun hat was destroyed, I was extremely excited and hopeful when I read in the reviews that this hat is pretty large and can fit big heads. I immediately ordered it and sat waiting by the window for the amazon man to arrive.<br /><br />That being said, I can’t begin to describe the disappointment when I ripped open the package, unfolded the hat (um yess this will be great to travel with), only to find out BOOM. It is WAY too damn small. So small that I didn’t even notice a difference between the hats I tried on the other day and this one, and this is supposed to be a large!!<br /><br />The interior lining is also super rough, wasn’t clean, and had a few of the plastic wiring sticking out. Alas, the search for a hat big enough for my giant head continues.<br /><br />If you have a big head and think this is it, it’s not. That, or you don’t have a big head."
1.0,not at all what I expected
1.0,so cheaply made
1.0,This what I received...not cool.at all for the price
1.0,The cats are not what is on the description.
1.0,Wasn’t what i thought it would be i personally did not like the material
1.0,"Advertised as 23 to 24 inches in length, but is only 17 inches."
1.0,The chain was in a knot right out of the box. Took us an hour to untangle it. Poor quality product for the money.
1.0,"If you have the original watch band, this will most likely disappoint you. The feel and look is cheap. I have purchased other bands and this is definitely the lowest quality of them all. It also doesn't fit securely in the groove of the watch. The ends both hang out just a little but it's enough to annoy me and is noticeable. I rarely give anything 1 star but this definitely is 1 star."
1.0,I have received another model sunglasses different from this one !!! i'm very disappointed
1.0,The screw driver is useless. It couldn't unscrew the screws.. The glasses are okay.
1.0,It's too big! In the picture is different.
1.0,"The fabric is not as pictured, it is black speckled and looks dirty. The material is think but the top smelled and the material was unflattering and cheap."
1.0,Too small!!!<br />Muy pequeño!!!!
1.0,Staining pillow cases blue
1.0,Not what I thought they would look like. The pearl on the heal was not attractive at all!
1.0,Made for a child or someone with an extremely small head.
1.0,"Cute but not made well. The pair I received was poorly constructed and coming apart the day they arrived. My girl would have loved them had they been in good shape, but I had to return them. I liked the price, but I'll probably stick with the croc brand."
1.0,"So small! I ordered a size large and my daughter who wears a small couldn't squeeze into this top! It looks very nice in pictures, but no way will this top fit."
1.0,This bra has zero support for anyone with boobs.  If you lean over they fall out the bottom as there is no elastic or band at the bottom. I wouldn't recommend this product at all.
1.0,"Yeah these aren't what's pictured. The nose of the skull is as big as my entire face. The materials very thin and the hims are sloppy and falling apart. They're useless. Complete waste of money,  neither practical nor aesthetically pleasing."
1.0,"Gave it to a friend since the return was $9, waste of money"
1.0,"This was to small ,it more for a kid and not adult. Way to small I would not tell anybody about this .it gets no star from me"
1.0,Hate this dress
1.0,I thought I got a winner but will return due to bad stitch & a hole. You get what you paid for.
1.0,lasted 1 month before it broke
1.0,Stones were off-set and earrings do not hang properly since hoop is on back at top rather than centered. Hey it’s just cheap costume jewelry so I wasn’t surprised. Was hoping it would be better as I’ve seen better costume jewelry at Walmart. It is as it is.
1.0,Odd material and poor fit
1.0,It broke two days after I got it
1.0,"Too small (ordered large after reading reviews... still too small). Poor quality. Plastic zipper and buttons. Very thin material, like a thick t-shirt, not a sweatshirt. Just an overall waste of my time and money."
1.0,"I bought a size down than my normal.  My current ones are Pearl Izumi (Red, Orange & Blue Padding} and LG. When I first opened the package I looked at the size, because they were LARGER than any others I had.  When I put them on, the waist was too big and the legs fit a little snug.  The material does NOT stretch or give.  The padding was not as thick as most of the ones I have.  Since I got them for such a deal, I will give them away, but it will deter me from buying any others of this brand."
1.0,"Under water, prepare to see DOUBLE images, for some reason!  Bizarre!  I wore them once; never again!"
1.0,NO ME LLEGA
1.0,Fell apart after two wearings and one washing
1.0,"Horrible fit, not at all flattering for a plus size woman, style is way too short and ill fitting. I normally wear an XL, ordered this in the 2X according to size chart. It fits but is a terrible design. The front of the shirt barely came to my waist."
1.0,"Thought would be a nice casual dress<br />The dress does not lay nice,the material quality is not there very cheap dress<br />Wanted to return had it alk set up,but cancel<br />You have to pay for shipping,got two dresses and it will cost me one dress to send back"
1.0,Way too phony!
1.0,"The stash had such a disgusting fishy smell couldn’t wear it  , waste of money"
1.0,I have to send these back because there were no backs on the stud earrings!
1.0,Easy to oxidize
1.0,The teal strap broke as soon as I put it on. Thr metal loop at the end that the other piece has to go through broke off.
1.0,"I purchased this excited to use it but received it without the shoulder strap, part of the seem coming loose, and with the inside zipper missing. Now I have to return it and get a refund and wait longer to purchase a different bag. I'm not sure whose fault it is but it's unfortunate that they would ship a product missing an important part like the shoulder strap. Other than that I can't really comment on how durable this item was as I was unable to use it."
1.0,"not as advertised, is not the same sweater. WASTE OF MONEY&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;"
1.0,"I ordered a 3X after ordering other products from other vendors out of the U.S and this is more like a U.S medium.  I ordered this as part of a Halloween costume but it will not suffice as that either since it doesn't close on me.  I wear a U.S. size 14/16 and wanted it very large on me so figured 3X would work, nope."
1.0,"This is such a disappointment. The fabric is awful. The label says 95% cotton, but it appears to be some sort of cheap synthetic. It also doesn't look like the picture. I am not happy with this one at all."
1.0,These are so slim they can only be pulled up the leg of my 5 year old daughter.  Everyone tried them on these were supposed to he adult socks.
1.0,"This top is not as shown. Very thin fabric. I wear several items from China, This is not acceptable. No."
1.0,"The sunglasses was a little rough around the bottom of the lens which kept scratching my son's cheek. Therefore, he's doesn't wear them."
1.0,Ordered 2 and both broke within a day. Got them fixed and then they broke some more. Didn't even get pictures put in before we had to throw them away
1.0,Not satisfied! Let’s are so small you can’t even read the necklace & the necklace itself came dangled & damaged
1.0,Lights were very poor quality— one light did not work right out of the box.
1.0,Bought some for myself and friends and family. They broke after a few wears
1.0,"If you wear these, you will soon be in the OBGYN office! There is no cotton crotch lining."
1.0,"My first unit arrived with the second hand unattached, I returned it for a replacement and had the second unit also defective. These are supposed to be nurse's watches but they do not keep time and the worksmanship is poor. Do not waste your money."
1.0,"I once bought them at 2015, I loved them at first however the battery doesn't last the long it die on me. When I ask for the battery replacement for a refund they didn't provide for me. This is a SCAM!! I will never trust this company every again. Hope you damn enjoy my money.."
1.0,Didn't get items
1.0,They are cheap and broke. Never buy again. I want a credit. Only had 3 months.
1.0,Sadness.
1.0,The clip snapped off.
1.0,They do t work a advertise.  They make no difference in my night vision.  I am returning them.
1.0,As other reviews the price to looks like a blurry copy and I did not see where it said for girls or petite women. So I have to return it. I am 5'3 and it's almost to shirt on me and I have a large chest that almost couldn't dress on and once I did they were smashed
1.0,"Glasses that I received were not the same style as advertised, I was not happy with the purchase"
1.0,"Overall product looked nice. Production is just cheap glued together pieces. No pins or hooks hold the jade to the gold. Item arrived in pieces in a nice undamaged package. Possible heat issue causes glue to soften and just fall apart. I would not recommend to anyone. Bad gift option as it will fall apart shortly after owning, if not come that way.<br /><br />It appeared to have nice looking jade pieces. Gold looked good. Quality and craftsmanship are a major issue. One section was also completely missing the gold Asian symbol on arrival. All segments were supposed to have symbols. Items in plastic bag were in pieces, of which the missing symbol did not exist."
1.0,"The top didn't fit her at all. We got a size 2T. It did end up fitting her 1-year old cousin, so happy ending. I'd say they're both of average size for their age, if not a bit on the small size. The pants were long enough, but a little tight around the waist. I guess order a size up or so if you get this. I think it's really cute otherwise."
1.0,I wore this belt 2 times and it came apart. it literally split apart front from back. threw it away. Don't buy.
1.0,"It looks lined, but it's not. The fit is small"
1.0,Looks like a good band to wide for my watch returned.
1.0,"So disappointed... Know it wasn't expensive,  but did not expect it to be failing apart so soon.  Stitching is already coming apart and he has work it less than 10 times.  Do not recommend."
1.0,"ILL IRRITATE SKIN, GILD IS FADED INTO COOPER"
1.0,It fit perfectly but at  first laundry wash lost color
1.0,it was damage
1.0,The size is not accurate and the material is poor
1.0,"Beyond disappointed. Received with large hole in dress. Wasn't even a tear, the stitches were never lined up and was sewn above where the two pieces of fabric should meet. Very cheaply made"
1.0,Looked like a pad.
1.0,Material was very cheap looking and front is very lose in front especially for flat chested gals
1.0,"Face collapsed, ugly"
1.0,Floral pattern is in the foot and ankle but disappears in calf.  First time wearing 3 pairs now and first day they fall down to the ankles.  Do not buy if you want knee highs.  Band is thin without much elastic.
1.0,Was not aware the watch cannot be read in dark conditions.
1.0,The size is not as written. The size is very large. The detail is very bad. The sleeves are small from the beginning and very large in the end. It is very bad. I want to get my money back
1.0,"Short torso, very high cut, minimal butt coverage"
1.0,DID NOT FIT AT ALL
1.0,Turns your finger green.
1.0,Sizing was way too small. We ordered the next to largest size and it didn’t fit our 4.5 year old (typically wears a size 6). Returned for a refund.
1.0,They smell old and moldy
1.0,This watch is a joke. After arrival the first hour it lost little more than a minutes. Great!
1.0,Broke trying to get it out of package
1.0,Had the necklace for one day and it already broke. p
1.0,"Please do not waste your time or money the shoe's are way to small I bought my size that I normally wear which are a 10 and the sandal fit like a size 9 I even try to Vaseline my foot to see if that would help, IT DID NOT, so they went back to the seller what a waste....."
1.0,Very disappointed! This was not what the picture looks like!
1.0,Not just a little small but 2 sizes small.
1.0,Poor quality material. Looks more like a Halloween costume than a nice shirt.
1.0,Came with Mark.  Tried to wash on delicate & seams popped.  Don't waste your money!
1.0,The model is not as shown in the photo. It seems very simple and of low quality. I had other expectations with the glasses.
1.0,"I have two other ratchet belts that I use all of the time. Ratchet belts are awesome. This one is so poorly manufactured, they are just jumping on the bandwagon with their junk.<br /><br />Don't buy this one. It fell apart immediately. I think a part is missing so it cannot be reassembled."
1.0,It peeled within a week
1.0,I didnt have the chance to use it cause the bottle was broken. :-(
1.0,There isn't a big difference in the color variation between the face and the numbers and the hands
1.0,Speakers are nice and loud but are only velcroed in the beanie. I bought two of these and have the same problem where the speaker would come off the velcro and work its way up to the top of your head
1.0,Very small and stiff fabric
1.0,"I like comfy and loose fitting clothes, but this dress was way too much material - made me feel I was wearing a tent."
1.0,"Thin, cheap, and nowhere near the quality of genuine Oakley lenses. They will snap into place, but rattle and will come out without depressing the release because they aren’t made to the tolerances of the real thing. The Oakley lenses are thick, rigid, and rounded at the edges. These were thin, flimsy, and had sharp edges. I want my money back..."
1.0,They are a waste of money and are NOT eligible for return...
1.0,They dont like the images. There is alot of broken pieces and just pieces  that looks like scrape metal not alot of earring hooks. Super disappointed
1.0,"Don't be fooled by pictures, every stitching to this shirt was not hidden ,they all hang out and u can't cut them t they will mk holes. Sucks"
1.0,Cheep. Small for an average adult face. No slot for a filter.
1.0,Not happy.  Runs extremely small!
1.0,I didn't like The dress it was very poor cualidy it look better in the picture that's why  I give one star...
1.0,The fit was terrible and not as it looked in the pictures at all. It looked like an oversized cardigan and the item. I received had arms that were two inches to short and it was very small. I ordered a medium based of the reviews and size recommendations but was very disappointed.
1.0,Bought these to replace a silver pair I lost.  These looked very cheap. I didn't like the white 'glue' that surround the crystals.  Returned the same day.
1.0,Picture is very  deceiving. It only comes with and  anklet not all the jewelry that completely covers your foot. Was also heavy. So again you only get the top part.
1.0,"When you choose the size, it doesn't appear if it's EU or US, but once you get the product you see that the US size is smaller than the EU one. Consequently, when I wear it in L (US), which means XL in EU size, it looks like I'm wearing my granma's nightgown!"
1.0,"The material is very stiff, the arms are extremely tight, and I would not recommend this."
1.0,"Thin, cheap,great for headbands and head bows. Snags very easily. But lots of variety for hair scarves."
1.0,It is super cheap and did not even last :/ i was so disappointed. I might as well just buy the real thing
1.0,When I slipped on the shoe the tab in back that you use to help get on snapped. Someone wrote fake and I laughed but after see such low quality which I have never seen from New Balance and the foam was not soft like my other New Balance shoes they might be right.
1.0,"I ordered this dress for my birthday this Saturday and what a disaster !!! The dress looks beautiful on the outside, but the lining on the inside was sewn with the front of the lining to the back! I don't understand how this dress was even shipped without someone looking at that or noticing it! Completely unhappy with this purchase. Very disappointed! Please check your clothing before you send them out."
1.0,This costume is very poorly made and seems to run on the small side. I'm also disppointed because it seems the skirt was sewn on backwards since it is awful long in the front and shorter in the back. I would return it but my daughter had her heart set on being Sailor Moon for Halloween. I do not recommend this product at all!
1.0,Too big for kids face.
1.0,Item was returned . Size. Chart is off
1.0,Actually only 8 inches. Not even close to fitting
1.0,pretty but turned in just a few days. waste of money
1.0,"I purchased these for my 7y/o old son. They didn't fit! I mean he's not any bigger than the average 7y/o and they were ridiculously tight. He spent his own money on them, and he really wanted them so we tried to make them fit, but after about 3 mins they were so uncomfortable he couldnt wait to get out of them. DO NOT BUY! NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!!"
1.0,Very cute but broke the next day
1.0,I am very disappointed with this gown.  The sizing is way off.  I normally wear a Large and had to order a 2XX and that is still skimpy.  The workmanship is very shoddy.  I should have realized you get what you pay for.  Would return it but I have washed it.  My loss.
1.0,me cobraron el producto pero no me llegó
1.0,"Very see through, very long, wasn’t happy."
1.0,This is not worth the purchase price. Material is cheap. It is barely big enough....doesn't adjust any larger.
1.0,"too big , too long, hood did not detach"
1.0,"Take forever to deliver. Ship from China so I expected the fabric will be nice. Turn out the color is faded, fabric is so rough and thick, didn't look good to wear with any kind of clothes. The zipper doesn't go very smoothly. I got another canvas bag on Amazon with the same price and it was way better than this one.<br />Edit: The seller is very nice. Even the product is not as described on the website, they still refunded my money and let me keep the bag as a gift. I was very surprised that they would do that. My impressions about KISS GOLD has improved immensely :) Thank you!"
1.0,"It was cut oddly, very flimsy material so the sleeves are bell like. I sent back the outfit."
1.0,In no way is this 18g . It's 20g or smaller. I will not order this again. Waste of money.
1.0,I buy pattyboutik all the time and this definitely does not wash well. All stretched out
1.0,"Came with a hole in one sock. I tried to send an email to the seller, but never heard back.<br />The socks themselves are very warm and comfortable, and though I can't speak to their durability, I would have purchased more in a heartbeat if the seller had made it right. I just don't want to reward poor business practices with more business."
1.0,"Upon arrival today, I tried the mask on.  This is a TERRIBLE consumer item.  Save your money.  I received the item today and have started Amazon's return process.  My review:<br /><br />1) Being a full head mask, it had inadequate holes for airflow and heat dissipation (tiny slits for eyes, a very narrow slit for the mouth)<br />2) The eye slits (if you can call them that) dangerously restricts one's field of vision (horizontally and vertically.  Unless one is acting as a still prop on a brightly lit stage or photo shoot, it would be extremely unsafe to go trick or treating or a party venue wearing this since you are like 90% blind and you would be tripping over stuff/bumping into people and objects.<br />3) The ""adult"" version of this mask did not fit me and per my wife, my chin was exposed - being a rubber latex mask, I probably could stretch over my chin, but it was already uncomfortable and I do not want to wear something that feels like many stretched rubber bands around my face...  It did not fit very well my 9 year old son either,<br />4) Being 100% latex rubber, it had an unpleasant rubber band box odor (this may eventually dissipate... but I am  not going to wait to find out).<br /><br />The only sensible use of this ""Adult"" mask is to use it as a prop on a manikin. But it is not advertised as such through Amazon.  So I strongly suggest that PopCap (Part of Electronics Arts Inc.) creator of Plants vs Zombies should seriously review their agreements with REV in Mexico before someone gets into a serious accident."
1.0,The picture that advertised the bag made it seem as if the material was strong and would stand up straight.  But it is soft and flimsy.  It has no stiff bottom to keep my items from being damaged. I wish I Could get my money back.
1.0,Fits as expected but not very flattering and cheaply made. One week of wear and it was starting to have obvious wear and tear.
1.0,Despite the listed size the item fits too large.
1.0,"The small is actually TINY. I can usually fit into a small at least... this in a small was like for someone who weighs 80 pounds. I weigh 125 and came no where close to getting into these. I don't think the medium would fit me either. And they are completely see-through. I expected some see-through-ness, because they are white obviously, but this was a little much. I am very disappointed with this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1.0,Fell apart after a couple days.
1.0,"These shoes must have been knock-offs from the real Chinese Laundry brand. The box smelled like a tire factory when I opened it, the straps to the shoes were extremely flimsy, and the fit was completely off. There is no way these shoes are truly a product of CL. Buyer beware!"
1.0,i bought size 33 and runs like size 30 i wish my money back
1.0,Sure is nice but order it 2 sizes up. I wear a M and ordered a L and it was still too small.
1.0,These boots do not last they deteriate fast<br />My feet were sweaty not because they were warm but these boots don't breath.
1.0,"You might get what you see on the display picture and as the reviews or you might get granny panties that make you look like an idiot , the bottoms did not have the band around the waist that I saw all the other reviews have and I'm pretty disappointed because I bought one for me and on for my friend , I absolutely hate this swimsuit never trust this company. UGLY AFFFFF"
1.0,I bought 9 total for my girlfriends. 7 out of 9 of my friends told me the anklets broke within one week of wearing them! I was so embarrassed!
1.0,"My husband wears a XXL, so I figured a XXXL would do the trick. Nope it fits like an XL."
1.0,it's a deception. You don't get the product from the image. It's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. Don't vote your money too bad
1.0,I did not get this skirt that's pictured. I ordered two...  a blue and a black. The blue is what is shown but the black is just a plain black non rouched skirt.  The blue was way too big.
1.0,Product in no way is as its described.
1.0,To big and don't stay together very well
1.0,This product works but had a terrible odor that even transferred to my clothing.
1.0,"They fit with the exception of my feet sliding way forward too much so that my toes touch the floor so, the slides are too loose to keep your feet from sliding forward. Not a good buy."
1.0,I got this because they said it would be perfect for and aizawa cosplay and it's too short it's very thin in it is already wearing out and I haven't worn it very much. Kind of disappointed to be honest
1.0,Wow i ordered 0-3 months and got 6-12.<br />This wont fit my girl till next year.
1.0,About 5 sizes too big... after readying review after review I THOUGHT I had the right size narrowed down but I was way off. And I’m a big girl lol. Definitely returning. Especially for the price. $30 is a lot for such a cheap product. Super disappointed. I was going to wear this in Cancun next month.
1.0,The material was very thin and the dress smelled awful when I took it out of the bag.
1.0,It wasn't complete so I returned it!
1.0,Breaks apart while in use...
1.0,Cut tight across chest if you have larger breast. Material started coming apart as soon as I tried it on. Horribly made.
1.0,"These sunglasses look good until you put them on. The optics are terrible, it’s very cloudy lens. I found my self squinting and getting headaches because of the poor quality of lens. I will never buy these again."
1.0,"The description said it would be silver, but what came to me was gold. You can't even see it in my blond hair."
1.0,"I waited for over A MONTH for this coat to arrive! And when it finally did arrive, it was nothing like what I hoped it would be. I ordered a medium (which I wear in everything) and I could barely get my arms in the sleeves, much less button it. And most importantly... THIS IS NOT A COAT!!! It is so light weight and thin that at best it's a jacket. I have cheap zip up hoodies that would provide more warmth than this."
1.0,xl fits like xsmall
1.0,Thin and cheap. Save yourself
1.0,Took a chance and shouldn’t have. Poorly made. The slip had several tears in it. Also looks like blood stain was on the dress too.
1.0,because the ring is narrow and flexible it's making holes in my pockets and catching on the dangling pocket threads..
1.0,It didn't fit.....way to big!!
1.0,This necklace and bracelet set isn't sterling silver. 😩 it broke out my neck and wrist just after one wear 🙄
1.0,The clasps on this wallet are stiff and hard to use. A day after I could no longer return it one clasp completely broke. Now one entire side of the wallet is useless. Would not buy this again!
1.0,"I wear 10/12 in shorts and pants, I could barely pull these up. If you are over a size 4 dont bother!"
1.0,It is a very nicely designed bra but way too small in the cups.
1.0,Top was too small and wouldn't stay up
1.0,"It runs extremely small. I'm not very big I usually wear mediums and large and I ordered a large and it was still way too small, it fit my ten year old sister better. I couldn't really get it over my arms and the apron couldn't fit over my boobs and I'm only a 36C so I can't imagine how it'd fit anyone who isn't petite."
1.0,This dress looks nothing like the description on the website
1.0,All sizes should have a disclaimer for petite as a standard. I feel like I bought a shirt meant for a toddler.
1.0,Fell apart after first use.
1.0,Didn't work for me. They all slipped off of my fingers :/
1.0,Shoulder strap does not sit naturally on your shoulder as it is pictured.
1.0,These shoes cut into the top of your feet. I had to find some different water shoes.
1.0,Ordered a Small size and it was huge.  Doubtful that an Extra Small would even be right.
1.0,If you like jewelry that looks like you got it for free when you bought a box of cracker Jack's then this is the place to get your jewelry
1.0,"These came brand new, frame already bent and uneven. They sat completely crooked on my face due to the frame already being unaligned"
1.0,Misleading<br />this is not a pretty slightly metalic rose gold it appears but an ugly pale pink
1.0,Oversized. Material is thin and shiny not as comfortable as expecting.
1.0,"Too small, but money was refunded."
1.0,"I wanted to love this because of a YouTube video I saw that promoted it. It is nice/ok but for half the price though! Did not fit well at different places, uneven alignment of lace and dress underneath. Nice color though."
1.0,Cheaply made. Very flimsy. Super cheap. Avoid.
1.0,This item already changed color
1.0,So very sheer.<br />Bought for a funeral and had to switch to an old worn out dress ive had since dirt was invented.
1.0,They looked horrible by the time we got them. Most of them had started tarnishing already. Many of them had excess metal around the edges. The pink color looked nothing like the pictures. They were useless for us.
1.0,Used it only for a week and already there is a tear on the shoes!
1.0,"These would be great, if the patterns weren't UPSIDE DOWN!!  Ibought these for my son to wear to school....I love that they have a loop, so when not being worn on the face, they can hang around the neck, but when worn properly, the patterns are upside down & look ridiculous!  Waste of time & $!"
1.0,Wouldn't stay on my head. If you have somewhat thick hair it'll just slide right off. Do not recommend for anyone with hair longer then your ears.
1.0,I didn't get to pick a size. It would not fit anyone. The ring was very pretty.
1.0,"Cheap quality, extremely thin and the stitches and edges are super thin and weird looking."
1.0,It’s very cheap fabric.
1.0,Does not fit true to size at all.
1.0,Cute costume but it didn’t fit. I ordered a medium and it was too small. I also didn’t like the fit of the mask.
1.0,I wear size XL or 14.<br />Ordered XL. Had to slid  each side on the waist area.
1.0,"Out of the package it was great! That aside, the leather is incredibly cheap.  I have worn it maybe for a week and has been worn with me on a couple runs.  It has warped, color has changed, and looks nothing like day one.  What did the seller/creator expect?  For it not to get wet?  Put a disclaimer on your package that asks you to not wash hands, to not workout with on, and to not perspire at all.  BETTER YET!  Just leave it off."
1.0,"Every piece is different material, different colors, and the print is different sizes. It seems like they bought items from different companies and threw them together to sell a set. So disappointing. Definitely returning. If it were sold separately, I would keep the earrings and bracelet."
1.0,The price was good but the product is made of really poor quality materials. It looks cheap and it is.
1.0,"Opening and retrieving your cards is a difficult process. It takes an extra few seconds, which is fine when you don't have a line of people behind you. Very tough and rugged but the break in time is about a month. Highly disappointed."
1.0,I need to chance this product I don't know what is XL  for this company it look medium
1.0,Zipper does not stay! Not worth the purchase!
1.0,Didn't work as expected.  Even the bigger ones are too tight.
1.0,"La tela de muy mala calidad, parece bata de dormir"
1.0,I wore it two times and when I needed to go to the bathroom the buckle failed. NERVER BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1.0,I got this last week and have worn it for maybe 3 days and a screw fell out rendering it useless. Was so cute otherwise! Bummer
1.0,Very disappointed in very flimsy quality of hat. Expected much more from a Disney product.
1.0,Disappointed. Material was not what I expected. Not worth the price. You could probably find one similar to it at a dollar store.
1.0,Only received one lip ring when it was supposed to be two
1.0,this dress runs way too small.
1.0,I bought this ring and at first it was beautiful but after 2 or 3 months the stone started falling out!! Very disappointed!! Don't buy this ring it is not worth the money!!!
1.0,Looks more for a male as far as the big band<br />Watch part too pretty for a guy.
1.0,2nd time reordered both times the words Embrace on the front are cut off and sewn into the zipper looks terrible.Very dissatisfied !
1.0,Was really excited to get this then opened up DEFINITELY NOT TRUE to size ordered a 3x and it looked more like an extra large literally asked 4 people to guess the size everyone guessed an extra large so disappointed.
1.0,Ended up returning it (and was charges to do so). It seemed like the print was sprayed on and there were a couple white lines where a string must have been on the shirt while it was being sprayed. Horrible quality.
1.0,Had to be returned! Planned for Oktoberfest but was clearly not white definitely more yellow & beige. Nice quality but unsuitable
1.0,The fabric they use for this is see through and super rough. I do not suggest this unless you want everyone to see your undergarments.
1.0,hard to get it and felt really tight
1.0,The color was the best and the texture. Too small.
1.0,I'd give it a -2 if I could.  It was so small a child could have worn it and construction was horrible.
1.0,"You should avoid this purchase.  The tennis bracelet is the smallest, most fragile I have ever seen.  The picture is deceiving. In addition, the clasp did not work well and one stone was already missing when it arrived. Very disappointing.  DO NOT buy this item."
1.0,Most of these are totally useless. Do a candle test on mask and see these blow out even with two on. Do research on all masks.
1.0,"This is a beautiful tankini top. I love it. The downfall is, that in the back of the top, there is nothing to hook up the straps to. The front of the top has 2. I am upset because I brought it with me on my vacation, and I am unable to wear it, and enjoy it. For the amount of money I spent, this should have come with 4 hoops, not 2."
1.0,"Delivered yesterday, snap completely ripped off jacket today.  I'm returning, but will buy again because my niece loved it so.much"
1.0,"Cheap construction, very light weight and flimsy."
1.0,The shirt fit as expected but the quality was terrible. Image on shirt slightly off center and there was residue from the iron on. That was smeared on shoulder. Should of looked closer as this was a Christmas gift. Definitely would not order any items from this seller in the future.
1.0,"Whoever does your sizing needs to be retrained, these supposedly M/L gloves wouldn’t even fit a small"
1.0,runs small i returned them.
1.0,I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband..he loved it..but it has never ran..I Guess it needs a battery..
1.0,Left lens too big. Got replacement and still doesn't fit. Took to sunglass hut and they couldn't get it to fit either. Pops out everytime you open the sunglasses. You can clearly see the gap when you're wearing them and look up. Very disappointed. Had to put original lenses back on. Probably better off that way. (Bought a separate pair for another pair of sunglasses and those fit fine)
1.0,I was in love and so happy to get until I looked at the back.  Whole sole is coming loose
1.0,Return policy was too short
1.0,"I don't like this product at all. It's too big, it's not comfortable and the Velcro is very annoying. I do not recommend."
1.0,"poor quality, stripes didn't match, and colors were not the same as pictured! Save your money!"
1.0,Thin and poor quality knit.
1.0,I did not like the style or cut of these.
1.0,I got a large and had to pull the bottom to my knee in order for them to fit. These are not for curvy women. Very disappointed.
1.0,These watches break very easily. They are not made of strong material.
1.0,"Too size,  I am 5'7&#34; 170 #  I typically wear women's 10-12.  The skirt was too small.  I was unable to zip or button.  I would need a X Large, may be 2 xl.  Style was an issue too.  There is one pleat in the middle of my body making it look like short or culottes,  not a great style.  Item was returned."
1.0,I purposely got this in 2xl so it would<br />Be really big on me but I could barely get it on because it’s so small. So disappointed and I felt ripped off!
1.0,"don't buy this watch its very bad and all functions doesn't work, the only value you will getting is the strap."
1.0,I do not like the fabric it's really cheaply made. I don't like how they fit. They fit more like an undershirt or t-shirt. I am plus size (2xl) if that helps.
1.0,Cheaply made. Broke on the first day
1.0,"I am respectfully requesting for a pair of polarized x-loop sunglasses<br />I received a package. However, the package was empty.... did not contain any sunglasses.<br />You may contact me @ 580-399-9315 personal cell phone.<br />Thank you.  Respectfully submitted Rick"
1.0,The ring is not smooth. It's rough around the edges and scratches the fingers close to it
1.0,"Bought this shirt… twice, for my ten year old. Both times, washed and air dryed it. And it shrunk so much it would not fit a five year old. Even the largest size."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:79899796753e5fa55d7e151933850efc]] Was super excited to recieve these glasses and I couldn't even wear them once. They arrived in packaging that was not damaged, however, out of the box, the glasses arrived bent, lenses scratched, and one of the hinges is rubbing the frame. Very, very disappointed."
1.0,Fits horribly
1.0,"Not worth the money. Very thin, no structure, pretty sad. Definitely returning."
1.0,"Smallest 10g I have ever seen, and the internal thread was cross threaded. Had to use pliers to unscrew them and by the time I got one out, the threads were ruined. Tossed in the trash where it belongs!"
1.0,"Also this was used someone, it is dirty."
1.0,The Nike check came off in a week
1.0,JUNK!  Fell apart within 5 minutes
1.0,I wore this sweater once and there is a giant hole in the pocket where it connects to the sweater.
1.0,The fit is awkward. Wish I could freaking return
1.0,Very bad smell straight out of the package. Cheaply made and bent up. Also the wide part is very small. Needed something quick for a photoshoot but this ain’t gonna work.
1.0,Broken was not happy really what were them.
1.0,Little to no info in instructions.  Can't get it to pair with any of our FOUR different phones.
1.0,"Way to big to wear as a necklace, the fish is huge. Sits in the palm of my hand , and nearly fills it up. Hangs in the rear view mirror, bc its too big to wear."
1.0,"I guess I was naive and didn't realize these were knockoffs, and not very good ones.  If I had time to return them I would have.<br /><br />The seller and shipping were great though. No complaints there."
1.0,"Clasp is off so difficult to wear. Very small. Go for the more expensive bracelets, its worth it."
1.0,Received 1st belt with no buckle.  Returned for replacement.  Replacement belt also had no buckle.  Not giving it a 3rd shot.  Very disappointed
1.0,the fabric was cheap stretchy very polyester.  it looked like a cheap PJ. returned.
1.0,"Size Chart is not as Describe, Seller not responding after contacting multiple times which is very unprofessional"
1.0,Cheap polyester. Not umpire. Returned.
1.0,Really thin ! Will do the trick for few hours but not for a full day...after one wash good for trash !
1.0,Size not acurate.the sleeves are twisted.not good quality.
1.0,"Completely different pair came. Very cheap, so alright for travel."
1.0,"These are awful- even at 90% off they went right in the trash. Single layer, thin, not covid safe to me. Don’t waste your $$ like I did."
1.0,Very cheap looking and short. I will give this to a child.
1.0,I have even taking the tags off and I has a hole in the sleeve
1.0,Pros: product is very warm<br />Cons: product sizing and fit is way off. I ordered up a few sizes(based on product reviews) which made it large enough to wear but the arms were still short and I looked like the Michelin man because the chest was so baggy plus the torso was short. Fit is horrible. I just donated this to charity so I would not have to keep feeling disappointed every-time I looked at it. I kept it for one year.<br /><br />Had I know it could have been returned I probably would have.
1.0,What a mess!<br />Flimsy<br />Fussy<br />Ties everywhere !
1.0,"I was expecting thigh high socks, these are a nylon material. They don't stay up. As soon as I put them on, they rolled all the way down to my knees."
1.0,"The chain was way too thin,bought my daughter one a bit thicker,I wore the other one less than a week and it snapped like a thread,a waste of money."
1.0,The style of the frame is very ugly and improperly fits your head. Dissatisfied because I was really looking forward to using these in various environments.
1.0,"My daughter wore these for a few hours and they are already worn out and tattered looking! I had to throw away a pair after my son wore his for one day. I was very excited to get these since my kids have very cold feet during winter months, but I am disappointed that these became disposable, 1 day wear :("
1.0,"Large for a medium size. Fabrics is ok, but it's already coming apart. It's good to use as pajamas!"
1.0,Came super big
1.0,"Maybe cuts down glare, but reduces vision for everything<br />Seems unsafe"
1.0,This sucked cause I waited a week to get this only for it to be in two pieces. Mad because I was going to wear it tomorrow
1.0,Xl was about a size 8/10
1.0,way too short.
1.0,The watch stopped working after a week of use. Do not buy.
1.0,feel apart
1.0,"Of 40 in the box, 19 of them don't work.  Pure waste of money!"
1.0,"Update: Aug 10, 2017 Only a few months old and the underwear has pilled terribly! I hate it when clothing does this because it will eventually catch and rub on everything and it is such an unpleasant texture. I do not recommend these at all. I was using cotton Hanes before this and they do not pill and are far cheaper.<br /><br />Original in May 2017:<br />Never wore nylon undies before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. So first off, they're super comfortable to wear. I wear these on more relaxed days when I am just going to the office. On the other hand, it does not breath *at all.* So I'm conflicted on 100% recommending these. I would like to wear them on hikes or while exercising. I did, and it was gross. My privates just smelled ripe because it doesn't wick sweat worth a heck.<br /><br />I'm keeping them for casual day usage, but I'm going to probably replace the rest of my undies with something that is 60%+ cotton so that there's more wicking and &#34;breathability.&#34;"
1.0,Too heavy for ears
1.0,"the glasses are cute. However- after wearing them for 15 minutes I actually had black marks on the bridge of my nose where the glasses sit, like the paint or something rubbing off onto my skin."
1.0,"The ring is reasonably attractive. It looks exactly as pictured. However, the listing claims it's made with 'meteorite,' and it isn't (it failed the magnet test), so this is deceptive advertising. A ring like this containing real meteorite will easily run you $300 or more. This is a fine substitute, if you're interested in appearance and aren't particular about what the ring is actually made of, but I'm giving it one star because the merchant is claiming it's something it's not."
1.0,"A couple of weeks after, i found a hold on my left leg. I work from home and none of my pants have been defective like this."
1.0,"Just got this in the mail, wow it smells absolutely horrible. I figured oh well my legs are pretty far from my nose so I would try it on. Well it doesn't fit.. what a waste 😣"
1.0,The watch band was advertised to fit S2 Garmin Watch.... It does not fit....
1.0,"This dress does not fit to size, it’s way to small and the material is not giving."
1.0,UGLY IN PERSON SQUARE HEAD
1.0,I was over the moon when I found this Hello Kitty band for my watch only to receive it damaged.  I will be returning it. 😪I might try again.  Not sure 😕
1.0,They should not be called “crystals” They are dull stones. The back clasp doesn’t fit tight enough to hold the piercing on your ear and the design is awkward. Definitely do not recommend
1.0,"I’m a 59 year old office worker who exercises 3x/week and I purchased 8 pair of Bamboo ankle-high socks for daily wear (sitting at my desk) and indoor cycling.  While they are not my only socks, they were in the rotation among similar-styled socks from athletic footwear companies.  As the title says, I liked everything about these socks and by all appearances they look to be well-made (thick, cushy, don’t stretch out, soft) but about 40% of them now have holes in the toe after 5 months.  Now I’m looking for another sock manufacturer.  Boo."
1.0,"I like the keychain butt I don't like how it had no battery left when it arrived, it was very disappointing. Now we have asked for a replacement and the replacement was also out of battery."
1.0,This bra was a total mess save your money.
1.0,"This is a pc of JUNK. So small I have gotten better toys from the dollar tree. And just found out you CANNOT RETURN.  Do NOT BUY. Very, very disappointed. And it was NOT CHEAP. $17.99 I will never buy from here again."
1.0,Arrived broken and needed them the next day.
1.0,I had really high hopes based on the reviews. But this is uncomfortable. The insides were too hard and I couldn't keep them on for the whole day.
1.0,"Id love to exchange it, xxl should fit more loosely on me, this is way off the mark.  I need to return it.  Wanted something i could put items in the pockets and have it stay comfortable."
1.0,Product fits smaller then chart stated. Plus my package was tampered with.
1.0,"I bought these gloves before xmas, Bc I was going to Sweden on vacation from Los Angles, I was really happy with them, they were super furry, BLACK, and beautiful and soft. However, I lost them the last day of my trip.<br /><br />When I got back to America I really wanted these gloves again, so I reordered them.<br />When I recieved my package, I was sooooo disappointed. The fur on the gloves were fake and dry, AND BROWN.<br />Completely different gloves.<br /><br />I warn all of you, DO NOT order these, FAKE!!!!!!! They will send you whatever they have in store at the moment!"
1.0,Broke in a day
1.0,It a kids size.
1.0,This was a cute skirt that was just the right length and fit until the zipper broke. My daughter only got to wear it once.
1.0,Whatever you do order much larger than whatever you think you are and whatever they have available because these are for little people Asian sizes.<br />Wast of money...
1.0,Not a true 3xl at all
1.0,This was a gift to my husband. I had to give them to my son. Sizes run a size smaller than stated. I am very disappointed.
1.0,These pants were so so so small it’s for a 7 year old that’s how small they were.
1.0,Dress was way too long. Had a hard time returning it. Thank goodness Amazon backed me up. It was purchased thru a third party seller.
1.0,Not good they leak.....por material not strong enough
1.0,I opened luckily to make sure it was what i ordered as its for my best friends birthday and it was tarnished and discolored. I’ll be returning it. It wa suppose to be rose gold and it’s almost brown.
1.0,"purchased in Feb. for my daughter's 4/14/18 wedding (she has tiny wrists),  not even 2 weeks later a sone fell out!"
1.0,"Careful when buying this!  Got it for my little girl for Christmas, put keys chain on my keys NYE and it has already broke off-kind if cheap!"
1.0,"Didn't look like the lining over the dress was sewn well. I'm a size 4, but bigger chested and it made me look very boxy. Unflattering for my figure. I knew it would be loose fitting, but it pulls away from my body once it has any static due to material."
1.0,"I leave for a cruise tomorrow, was really excited about wearing this but it it WAY TOO SMALL. I wear about a size 4 and the large I bought was way too small. I even followed the sizing recommendations. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Top of teardrop,Sterling silver bent."
1.0,Way to constricting
1.0,Very disappointed in this product. The moment I got it in the mail I put it on and the chain broke not even wearing for 1 min. I have a 26” waist so I did not make it too tight just enough for it to sit on my waist. DO NOT BUY VERY VERY CHEAP
1.0,"Black bled all over my skin just trying it on, fabric was too shiny.  I'm going to try washing it and see if it looks like something wearable afterward.  Fit was fine."
1.0,Before I even got it out of the wrapping the feathers were falling off. They’re just barely glued onto a piece of cardboard for each wing. I don’t know how they’re usually made but I needed it for my daughter and it would have been destroyed if she wore it for even a short time. The cardboard has something metal in it so you can bend them slightly into a shape you like. They would look great for a picture but wouldn’t last for a costume for an extended period of time
1.0,"This is my 2nd order and the size is wrong,"
1.0,Runs very small. My daughter is 9. I had to give to my neighbor's 6 year old. Quality seemed fine.
1.0,"Sexy underwear; but, not size for a grown man"
1.0,"Looked and worked great for a month, but all of a sudden the mirror finish wiped  right off when I was cleaning them (with provided cloth). 2 days after return period was over."
1.0,Lost de stone just in one weared. Horrible quality
1.0,DON'T WASTE $25 ON THIS! TERRIBLE QUALITY AND  IT'S FAR TOO TIGHT.
1.0,The quality was very cheap and the small label on the sleeve was so random and awkward would not lie again
1.0,i did not expect much but it quite in less than 24 hrs
1.0,"Ordered a large and a medium in one order.  Received two extra larges.  That's after my original order of an large, and receiving an extra large."
1.0,Infected my piercing
1.0,I need 2 black sleeves and 2 screws to complete the job of assembling my own shoe laces.
1.0,I expected the soles to be hard because you can wear them outside. But the whole shoe was hard and uncomfortable
1.0,Recieved wrong necklace!!
1.0,It runs small & came with stains on it
1.0,Don't waste your money on this crap. Thin as hell and looks like a fish net. I'll be returning this ugly thing. Very disappointed
1.0,"Very thin, not meant for cold weather."
1.0,I don’t like the sound this makes every time I hear my Fitbit. It’s sound like I have some dog tags around my neck… it’s more annoying than I expected.<br />I stopped wearing it altogether.
1.0,This looks like a child made this and shipped it straight from china. The material was such poor quality that it was almost see through and there were a lot of unfinished edges
1.0,They were ok nice and sparkly good size
1.0,Missing other string to tie and too short
1.0,"It ran very  large and the writing was so faint, it was so cheap looking. Definitely would not recommend!"
1.0,"They were rose gold, not yellow gold. I immediately returned them. So disappointing"
1.0,They were too small have to return
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c05844c75533a86f959e6a3e4095441a]] It isn’t real as described not even marked with .925 and is already tarnished before delivering!
1.0,"Like the hat.... dislike the grease stains on the crown and brim as shown.....would like too receive a credit, or send a new hat !"
1.0,Warning this item runs 3x too small.  I ordered a 2X and it would not fit a friend who is a size Medium.
1.0,$9.00 for a kids plastic keychain that you cannot even choose which one you get is not a good deal<br />Waste of money!
1.0,"This dress is really pretty, and it looks like the picture. It’s really comfortable and soft but it’s extremely short. I am 5’8 and was barely mid calf on me."
1.0,they are fakes
1.0,Couldn’t even get over my thighs. I’m a size 12-14 and the XL was way too small.
1.0,Item broke first time I put on and beads flew everywhere.
1.0,Bezel fell off instantly.  Glad there was a warranty.
1.0,Broke during the first day.  Get what you pay for.
1.0,These came in a bigger size than I expected. It was supposed to be kid sizes not men sizes. I couldn’t contact any manager to ask what will be the appropriate size for me.
1.0,Horrible! Deflective. Clasp will not stay closed and they are very heavy. Due to the price just chalked up as a loss
1.0,"The description states SWEATSHIRT, This is NOT a sweatshirt, you can literally see through it."
1.0,I like the heat vest. It's useful. But battery is not good.First time battery life stay up to 4.5hrs on red. Second time battery life stay up to 2.5hrs ( fully charged)on red light.
1.0,Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a better quality item.
1.0,This product is flammable so will not ship.<br />I have to return it. this is such a hassle for a small purchase.
1.0,Trash
1.0,"This is not thick as the packaging states. It is very thin and looks used with seams showing and fabric that looks like it has been drug across rough concrete.<br /><br />I would return it, but I need it tomorrow for a trip we are taking. Don’t believe the positive reviews."
1.0,I understand you get what you pay for but this thing broke the minute I tried to take it out the package.
1.0,"These were a little big........and they are not at all made of good quality denim.  It is thin and cheap looking.  The embroidered roses and leaves are not attached completely to the denim and hang loose....making them look unfinished.  The so-called distressed look failed as well, as there was only one &#34;cut&#34; on each leg and it looks like a toddler with a pair of safety scissors got it.  I am not at all thrilled with these......and I would not recommend them at all."
1.0,Chain was broken when received + I ordered the letter M but got a ♡ instead
1.0,This watch is trash looks cheap
1.0,Looks too cheap won't buy again
1.0,"Not at all like the photo. Sleeves barely reach my wrists. Clingy, not flowing like the pic."
1.0,the mask i received has WHITE stitching! not blue that is shown. this is horrible.<br />the mask is pleated not formed as shown<br />the mask also has 90s for the corners not curved as shown
1.0,"Fabric is very cheap, and thin. I am returning them, as they ripped within 24 hours of wearing them-- the fabric almost freyed apart where it ripped."
1.0,I am soo not happy. Yes it fits perfectly  but I problem  is the colour  is nothing like I odered. I got the green and I got a light ugly green. ..I am so disappointed 😞
1.0,"its a piece of silky fabric, with a ball sewn on the top. its not your typical winter hat/beanie material."
1.0,Way too big doesn’t stay up.
1.0,I do not care for these. They are very hard. Not soft and stretchy like others I have bought. Won't work with any of my elastic in various sizes.
1.0,"These were too small and I do not have a large face. Also they were very hard against the face - it felt like plastic - not silicon. But most importantly, I purchased them because several reviews said they prevented fogged glasses. They did not work for me to prevent glasses getting fogged up. In fact the fogging was worse with this device."
1.0,Shipping was FAST ordered Friday got my package Monday but dress runs huge I hate it don't recommend to buy
1.0,Just got this last month. I have used this product about 6 times and it's tearing up already. I also do not feel a difference. I am getting a refund back!
1.0,The charms fall off easily
1.0,This shirt is cute and the lettering is pretty.  That is about all I can say on the positive side.  I ordered my regular size (L) and it looked like a kids tee.  I sent it back and ordered the larger size.  It fit fine UNTIL it was washed.  Now I have a kids tee again.  I guess this shirt is not ever meant to be washed.  A total waste of my money.  I'd never order from this company.
1.0,"They are not thermal, they don’t stay up, they don’t keep your feet warm at all and I only received 12 out of 48 pairs. I will NEVER buy from the company again"
1.0,"super disappointed with the quality - it ripped after just ONE wear, I wore it to work and realized it ripped right at the seam in the armpit area when I got home, unfortunately it's just cheap and poor quality. Be warned in case you purchase it.. such a bummer since it's a beautiful shirt!"
1.0,"Cheap material , cheaper than the 10 dollar spot. I brought a size bigger based on the reviews and it was huge. It stretches slot so I would say stick to your true size, one day outfit"
1.0,"WRONG SIZE IN BOX, WRONG PATTERN IN BOX"
1.0,Very cheap quality. Definitely not for an adult.
1.0,Not great quality.....
1.0,Got this for my husband and had to give to my 10 year old son
1.0,"These certainly look same as famous bowling ball makers type, but are horribly slippery and it never fades. My left foot goes every which way in my slide. Bought name brand pair like in past and problem went away; very controlled left foot slide now."
1.0,"Missing stones, stone in one eye crooked. DISAPPOINTED."
1.0,"Glasses arrived in an envelope, no case and they were crooked and the nose pieces were jacked up.  Returning them!"
1.0,"The fabric is very thin.  It's soft, but it's a thin, very smooth jersey type material.  I'll need to wear a shirt/tank under it, but it would not be warm, anyway.  The neckline is huge.<br /><br />The label says it was made in China, there are washing instructions, but the fabric is unidentified.<br /><br />If I were shopping in person, I would not have considered it."
1.0,"Socks are THIN like panty hose material & do NOT stay anywhere above knees . It’s long enough but quickly & easily ROLLS DOWN to suffocate  instead of comfortably hugging . I have a thick body type , small upper thick lower & was looking for thigh high socks that would stay up high & provide the comfort & support & ordered this but overall am disappointed . So all I can do if I wear them is wear them up to just under my knee &fold to hide the remaining material bc wearing any higher than knee causes to roll & suffocate & CREATES a “thigh roll” where there is none."
1.0,Lol by far the worst thing I've bought on Amazon. The crappiest polyester material with a pixelated print on it and it was missing the straps in the back. Do not buy from this retailer.
1.0,"Not as advertised, the wrap around tie wasn't provided and the cut didn't go under my breasts. It looks like a moo moo not a wrap around dress. Returning my purchase."
1.0,These panties were way too small and are cut shorter than what’s pictured.
1.0,"Not so great. Wasn’t what I was expecting, not worth the price. Already rusted when I received it. Nothing like the picture. As another had said.. the quality is like something you get out of a gum ball machine."
1.0,I wore them once. Went to take them off and one of the medallions had fallen off. I was sad because they were so pretty.
1.0,both pairs are the same brand. the blue pair is a 3x. the white pair i got today and it says its a 3x on the sock. are you KIDDING ME?? this is the second pair i got where the size is WAY off. This company is garbage.
1.0,Super disappointed in this sweater. The collar is coming apart from the rest of the sweater and I maybe wore this twice.
1.0,"the material is awful. It is NOT a button up, but buttons are simply sown on as decoration so it cannot be adjusted. feels and looks like an 80s couch."
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture. Looks more like a nightgown.
1.0,The socks are very tight and very hard to get on my feet.
1.0,"Thin, low quality, poorly sized boxers. I guess I expected more with a designer name on them. I just basically wasted my money because I will never even wear them."
1.0,When I tell you this is the thinnest material I ever felt it feels like my curtains on my curtain rod and it’s see through
1.0,"Chinsey material, not true to size. Order a size larger."
1.0,I ordered 3 jackets from amazon and all ran really small. I haven’t been able to return them. Wasted 80.00
1.0,Very bad quality. This if after TWO days of use.. Seriously?!
1.0,We put it in a wash bag and washed it 1 time.  Chain broke and cannot be repaired.  My return window disappeared 2 weeks ago so money is lost. Do not recommend
1.0,"rubbish, like your girl. Just rubbish."
1.0,Already said in headline!
1.0,Hat got wet and blue color bled all over the hat.  Had to throw it away.  Okay if you never get caught in the rain.
1.0,"The attachment point for the jewelry into the piercing itself is very wide, so unless you have a gauged belly button, then this won’t come near sitting flush to your stomach due to it being pushed out by this wide back piece. Terrible design."
1.0,"I checked my measurements against the size chart prior to ordering and the shirt was still a little snug.  I knew the material was light weight based on the description/reviews, but it's MUCH thinner than I anticipated (definitely NOT a shirt to wear in cold temperatures).  It was stretchy material just slightly thicker than pantyhose and fits skin tight.  The photo makes the shirt appear as if it's a little flared at the bottom, but it's not - it's straight-fitting.  I was disappointed because it looks so pretty."
1.0,It was really cute while it lasted but the hook attaching the strap to the purse broke just over a month after I have had it. Too late to return it now.
1.0,Self-Winding not working.  Stop while on a winder.  One of the hands fell after 2 months and completely stop working.
1.0,These are made out of silk panties lol if any company says it’s going 2 take more than a week it’s probably from China rethink what your ordering omg these will not work for corvid need refund somebody asked me if they smell like Chinese food lol don’t buy from this company
1.0,Does not retain any shape at all. It did for a day and is sad looking now.
1.0,Runs very small & not flattering. I think it might look better on a taller woman. I’m only 5’2 didn’t look good on me.
1.0,Unbelievably small
1.0,This is about 3 sizes too small and the material is a silky Shiney cheap material that feels like if You move wrong it will rip! Bad bad Purchase!
1.0,very small terrible fit
1.0,"I got XL for my 10 years old, she is normally a Large. The sleeves were to small for the shirt. It's a 3/4 sleeves."
1.0,"La bolsa  a rayas Blanca y roja ,No es lo que esperaba en la foto  se ve más grande y el cierre es un desastre,no es de lado a lado,la verdad es que esto no me cirve .todo lo demás está perfecto"
1.0,I haven’t even worn these in the pool yet and they’re already falling apart. The film on the inside is flaking and one side doesn’t have suction so they don’t stay properly. I’m really glad I didn’t try to swim with these without trying them on first because I would have lost a contact and gotten antifog/mirror coating in my eye and likely scratched a cornea. Very disappointed and will return.
1.0,Initially sent incorrect item but quickly fixed it at no cost. Correct band came but it doesn't work well. It's not easy to put it in the holes and constantly pops off my wrist. Had to buy a different brand.
1.0,One section is so tight that it's uncomfortable.
1.0,Looked cheap like it came from a gun ball machine<br /><br />Painted plastic
1.0,Shoes too small.  Wear a 9 and the 8.5 to 9.5 size was too small.  Arch fell in wrong place on my foot.  Did not like the feel of the material.  Sent them back.
1.0,"I gave it a star only because the material of the bra is comfortable and soft but too bad I cant wear them, the zipper is cheap. The bra doesnt stay zipped at all! I spent the whole day fighting with the zipper to stay up until finally the zipper broke off. What a waste of money and time. Very disappointing."
1.0,tightest jeans you will ever find. smells like a warehouse when delivered too. lame.
1.0,Sent back need sizes by number
1.0,Wrong color.... tan or taupe
1.0,This is not a kids 7!!! This is for a toddler. More like a 3T!!!!
1.0,I thought it would be more form fitting...it sits on my head like a clown hat!!!!
1.0,I wore this item 1 time and my daughter says.... it’s ripped on the back.  I’m not very happy with purchase.  Material has a thin line across the back.
1.0,"Wore this once without any problems. The second time I tried to wear it, the clasp broke."
1.0,I bought this for a Christmas gift and it broke in half within days of wearing it. Return code never worked after multiple requests.
1.0,"The boots came with no padding in the shoe. They are too hard and uncomfortable to wear on a day to day let alone to work. Purchased my own inserts to try and make tolerant , but just made them slightly less hard. Why would boots come without ant padding inserts whatsoever?!"
1.0,"Cheap fabric with pilling and runs. It's dull, and thin in the &#34;cheap&#34; rather than &#34;delicate&#34; sense. It also smelled terrible out of the plastic, although the scent dissipated overnight. What makes this a dealbreaker for me is the static. I have tried everything to make this scarf manageable, and it is still static-filled, and clings to literally everything. I bought this to use as a headscarf, but it's unsuitable for that purpose due to fabric quality. Thanks to the static, I won't be using it as a neck scarf either. The only place this is going is the trash. What a waste of money."
1.0,I bought FIVE of these. 4 didn't work and the band broke on one. My fiance told me never to buy this watch again. Worst gift ever. Sucks bc its a really cool looking watch. Too bad they don't work....AT ALL.
1.0,My shoe size is 12.5 mens. Sorry your socks don't come any larger. Maybe you guys can work on that.
1.0,The zipper on the dress is broken in the middle of the dress! It’s very Obvious that the person who packed it knew it was broken because it wasn’t even zipped up all the way!! I literally just opened it up like 10min ago!!
1.0,"Product is not what I expected-not made well, patchy material with inconsistent texture, there were idk ‘rubberized material’ (? yes, that’s what it felt like to my touch) textured spots of fabric sewn into the pants, sewing is inferior. Pants are just a bad mistake as though manufacturer threw out the pattern....?"
1.0,Very cheap looking. No able to use it.
1.0,They had been use by someone else was not happy with them so I  order another pair and returned the other pair
1.0,"Colors aren't like the pictures, the silicone is hard and the edges are sharp and hurt to put in, and they are to long. They stick out almost .25 inch on both front and back of my ears."
1.0,This shirt is a stretchy material. Not at all like cotton. More like rubber. Would not buy again.
1.0,Broke within 1 month of use.
1.0,I just received my mask in the mail but I did not get the filters to go with the masks. I usually like to be able to test the the product before leaving a review but sadly I can’t with out the filters.
1.0,When it came the gray one was broken in to two pieces.
1.0,"Very see through fabric, and very light weight."
1.0,"I wore this shirt once, washed it, and it fell apart. Now to try and figure out how to get it replaced...."
1.0,I didn't care for the leather.  It felt rubbery.
1.0,"This watch looks amazing I thought it was exactly what was needed but there’s no backlight to the watch so you have a very hard time seeing what time it is.  So much potential, but returned."
1.0,"The material, fit and product sucks! Don’t buy!"
1.0,The waist of the shorts was the same as a pair of 6-9 month shorts I had.
1.0,"Returned this, ordered 3xl and the arms were so tight"
1.0,Very cheap material it does not hug your body like the photo
1.0,Sizes are wrong
1.0,I literally had these glasses for about a week and the screws fell out. Garbage now!
1.0,"The top was essentially the size of a pastie with strings attached, and the bottoms were super thin. Also the material was a bit itchy."
1.0,Color is slightly off still nice. The main disappointment is that it was folded into fourths damaging the brim and leaving creases that are so awful that no amount of shaping will fix it. The hat is adorable but completely unwearable!
1.0,"The jumper was absolutely adorable, but the inseams between my legs ripped almost immediately. Perfect fit, but I ended Up showing more of my private business than necessary. Too bad. I liked it, but it didn’t make it half the day. Extremely embarrassing"
1.0,Baggy and ill fitting.  Not comfy
1.0,What I did not like is that the locks did not prevent the cords from slipping at all.  Simply put it provided not value at all.
1.0,Hat drawstring broke the second I received it. Returned
1.0,Never got what I paid for. Scam!!!! And it took almost two months to get something completely different than described. No bracelet at all.Do not waste your money.
1.0,"Cheaply made!  I should have read the reviews ahead of time.  The picture makes this look like a nice costume, but it is not. Pieces of thread were everywhere when I opened the package, it was wrinkled beyond belief (I am afraid to touch it with an iron), and looks super  cheap.  Not sure if my daughter will get through Halloween night without it falling apart."
1.0,"I ordered a small, I am normally a small in everything. This swallowed me, it was huge! It also was much longer than it looked like it was supposed to be. I am returning it."
1.0,"This shirt is not machine washable.The shirt's label directs you to only hand wash the garment. It was also a bit itchy to wear against your skin as a base layer should be worn, unlike other merino wool products that I have. I am returning the item."
1.0,Flimsy. Thin material
1.0,It's junk. The clasp won't open so I can't even attempt to put it on. And they won't let me return it because I threw away the bag it was packed in. At least send me a clasp that works!
1.0,"Uncomfortable, does very little to lift.  Cheap cookie cutter, no quality."
1.0,Ripped within the first 20 minutes. Total fail.
1.0,The quality was horrible. I returned.
1.0,"Quality is poor on this product, 3 days in the stone fell out, would not recommend"
1.0,The shirt is cheaply made. I didn’t realize until I got to work and someone pointed out that the shirt was stitched together wrong and it was bunches up at the shoulder... not happy
1.0,Absolute junk. My only daughters wedding.  In very warm Hawaii so wearing tux with no jacket only suspenders showing on white tuxedo shirt. Went to attach these 10 minutes before the ceremony and the attaching clip broke on first attempt to connect. The clips are cheap metal junk. My am not happy and do not recommend these for anything but throwing them in the trash..  I am pis-ed anyone would sell such crap knowing people count on Such items to function!
1.0,Cheaply made and each one (set of 3) was a different size
1.0,"Very disappointed with this product. The umbrella arrived broken in pieces. The fabric was damaged, the ribs support and the poles bent. Zero stars."
1.0,"The drop down menu said 18plus, the bag the dress came in was labeled 14/16, and the tag on the dress said xxxl. Well, it fit like a 14/16. Material was not a great quality."
1.0,Looks awful in person and made cheaply with cheap materials
1.0,Too small terrible waist of money does not fit pandora
1.0,"The dress is adorable & I got a lot of compliments on it, however, the quality is terrible. I wore it once to Magic Kingdom & it is cover in fabric pills & pulls."
1.0,It's nice but was too small for my neck
1.0,"opened the box, held them up, and could see the window behind them through all the holes. Don't buy unless you just get really sweaty in pants because I don't see any other purpose"
1.0,"The paw prints were like smeared, and there was almost spider webby paint peeling off some of them? And I couldn't get it to attach to my fitbit... as of now completely unusable. 😕 i'll try again, see if I can get it to stay... but yeah not sure it will."
1.0,These have the words fashion written down the side. Not in the photo on the color I purchased. Look horrible. I’m returning. Do not recommend! Legs are extremely short too
1.0,"These fell out of my ears multiple times the first time I wore them. The are much larger than I thought. I returned them. They are really pretty, but not practical."
1.0,"The order took very long to come. The bodysuit is huge, the tights were made for a toddler and broke immediately when trying to put them on. The boot covers are a joke (not made for legs more like arms) the headpiece is bent up and the gloves are small. I would not recommend ordering."
1.0,Not good quality and legs were extremely long
1.0,Wish I would have read the reviews closer. Was expecting the shirt to have a faded logo for a vintage feel. This shirt has a terrible looking iron on transfer print. Looks VERY cheap! Didn’t even try it on-requested a return.
1.0,"Poor quality and incorrect size. This size only for kid. Design very strange , not like on a picture."
1.0,"see through, small, no support"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6c6a218dc4e14eec462198cdc162f6d3]] Scratch
1.0,"It fit my daughter right on the top but it was just way too long for 12-18 month, it would fit a 3 year old if they were as thin as an 18 month old"
1.0,My daughter's broke 3 in the first week they are made out of super cheap plastic.
1.0,I ordered a size bigger in case of it fitting smaller. Was super tight. I got a large. Still tight. Not flattering at all
1.0,"The fabric was a pretty color, but it is that rough polyester material that reminds me of my grandma's dresses.  The dress was also huge!"
1.0,This shirt was about the size of a small and I ordered a large.
1.0,"These pearl earrings are listed as ""freshwater"" when they are just plastic."
1.0,Just not a cute fit. Fabric is very thin and clingy (not in a good way.) Tried it on and packaged it right back up again.
1.0,Dress fit every where except in the top. The top seemed to be much smaller than the rest of dress. Ordered an 8 and the top fit my daughter who wears a size 2/4.
1.0,"Ordered with two day shipping on Sunday, received on Thursday. Opened up package to find that it was not put together in two of the main parts ( rhinestones) I could not exchange or return because I needed it on Saturday. On Friday I had to BUY round chain pieces to put it together completely. So I ended up having to spend more money on it....... Not happy. BUT once I put it together it looked nice for costume."
1.0,"Not what I expected but not worth shipping them back. I was expecting a pair of all Black sunglasses. I received the glasses shown, but the arms of the shades were chrome/silver colored and the lenses were mirrored. May have been a shipping error, but still for the price paid, I did not even want to take the time to ship or return them back. So I ordered a different pair from the Seller which turned out fine."
1.0,"Completely agree with the other reviews, I could not get it over my head. The dress has no stretch or zippers and an empire waist. The quality was terrible and it’s not as described. I’m convinced the only good reviews are bots. Do not order."
1.0,"This is a bad product.<br /><br />No color in can!<br /><br />Used on suede boots and there was no difference after use!<br /><br />Don’t waste your money.<br /><br />By the way, notice that I am the only reviewer giving one star. How can it have a three star rating? Hmmm"
1.0,This is a horrible jacket! There are Feathers coming out of the nylon and strings everywhere. Sending this back immediately!
1.0,They broke literally seconds after I took them out of the package. Tried tons of glues to fix them but nothing is holding them together. Severely disappointed.
1.0,"Junk do not waste money, broke almost immediately"
1.0,They are very cheap an very small
1.0,"Packaging was inadequate. Nothing was inserted with the rack to keep it from bending. 8 Ball Rack was bent and creased when received. I tried to do a return but keep getting an error message. If you feel like throwing money away, I would suggest buying this. If you want a good Magic Ball Rack, go buy one somewhere else."
1.0,"The photos the seller is using to advertise is not the product you will be receiving. Skirt is way too short, pompoms flat. At least I paid $35 for a nice pink bow…"
1.0,Cheap material.  Ripped after 3 days
1.0,"When trying to twist off the ball for the earring, the gem falls out as its not properly set into the earring. Also, the sizing for the earring is INCORRECT. It states 6 mm for each earring but it is clearly longer than that."
1.0,Baby since I did that we bought this necklace for the sweet message about friendship and cute packaging. However when it arrived it had no message or cute packaging. (See picture) The friendship message was kind of the whole point of the neclace for this purchase!
1.0,"Bought two of these, on in black and this one.  They are really cute, but both Up trackers have fallen out and gotten lost within the first week of wear.  They are not secure in the bands.  I am really disappointed."
1.0,Belts and boxes smell like mildew - like they came from a wet warehouse.  Trying to air out
1.0,"The chain pinched, and when I tried to put in on a different chain, the mermaid tail broke."
1.0,The bottoms fit as expected. The actual bra part fits but the loose attached tank is ridiculously long and way oversized. The fabric is great just completely sized out of proportion. Very dissapointed!
1.0,"The top was too loose and the midsection too tight. Also very long on a 5'3"" frame. Paid to have it shipped back for a return and never got money back."
1.0,"Negative stars. Never buy this belt. Used it once and hole is ripped.. Crappy, s***ty and should not b sold... So disappointed"
1.0,"After only 8 weeks, these mittens fell apart while transferring them from one coat to another. String fell out, seams split. Very poor quality."
1.0,"I put it on, laughed, and never used it again."
1.0,No instructions on how to adjust the band.
1.0,"Very unflattering, uncomfortable & cheap. The control areas are odd & push tummy downward causing you to look like you have a gut instead of all around control to slim & shape. Very disappointed."
1.0,Shoes run very small
1.0,not what i was expecting cheap fabric
1.0,"DO NOT GET , PICTURE DOES NOT MATCH ITEM, COLORS ARE WRONG AND CHARLIE WASNT AN ANAHEIM MIGHTY DUCK"
1.0,I liked the items but it was the wrong logo..Mustang logo not the Lincoln logo
1.0,No me gusto la tela esta muy sencilla
1.0,"Reviews said to order larger so i did, ordered a medium for my small wife. it was a little too big. I tried to retrun it then I was required to pay for shipping to China, so i decided to keep it and give it as a gift. I gave it to a medium sized woman and it is too small, and there is no way it is a ski suit, as there is hardly any insulation."
1.0,"Too long for a short person, tiers on dress hit in the worst spots, especially if you have a bigger booty and any kind of mom belly. Fit was awkward on my body shape."
1.0,Got the watch and did not work at all.
1.0,This dress is poorly made. It looks like it was stitched by a child... The material is polyester. So bad. I am trying to return this dress.
1.0,"I purchased this $8+ goggle and realized it was identical with a $5 no brand name google I purchased. The only difference was their logo on the strap and frame. The packaging was fancy but goggles were poor quality.  I tested it out in the pool,  and had same results as the cheaper $5 goggle.  It hurts your eyes from the blurriness of the lens and the side clasps located at the temple area hurts and pulls hair.  Wearing a swimming cap will prevent your hair from pulling but the pain and blurriness from this goggle is too much to handle."
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter, and she can’t even wear the sandal because the back is open. It comes with cheap plastic straps that have no directions on how to use them. When trying to adjust them, they just stuck to each other. Poor design, and a waste of money now on shoes she won’t enjoy"
1.0,When I opened the package it was already broken because it's so cheap. I'll have to fix it with gorilla glue or just throw it out.
1.0,Way to large on me. I’m a cup D and 135 lbs and this is way too loose fitting on me.
1.0,love the concept but it fits weird on me
1.0,"The material is good and thick.  I bought my daughter size large and this one seems to look like an extra small and one of the arm openings looks like a size extra large , the other one looks like an extra small . This was badly made."
1.0,"I’m pretty sure everyone’s seen the reviews that show the solo loop falling apart. Here’s why it does:<br /><br />• Solo Loops made by Apple are made with high-quality silicone, and not cheap silicone that breaks apart easily.<br />• A real Nike Sport Band is made from Fluoroelastomer infused with Stainless Steel, which is highly resistant to breaking.<br /><br />Basically said, unless Apple makes it themselves, a Nike Solo Loop is pretty much impossible. It’s best everyone steers clear of this item, and goes directly to Apple for a Nike Sport Band."
1.0,Fell apart almost instantly. Extremely poor construction.
1.0,Trash. Ordered two and the plastic holes came out of mask when I opened cover. Do not order them. I would ask for money back but not even worth the time.
1.0,Very heavy on the face and feel very cheap
1.0,Horribles
1.0,"I do not have very sensitive skin, but after a day of wearing it, had a bad rash where the metal clasp was."
1.0,"I ordered this for my cousins 16th birthday, it looks beautiful. It broke after a day."
1.0,NOT LEATHER but plastisized surface over felted paper/leather scrap. GARBAGE. Junk seller - not to mention about 6 inches short
1.0,Ordered large and received kids small
1.0,After the first wash the strings on the back become horribly tangled and they'll never get back they originally were. It's very frustrating.
1.0,The earrings were tarnished!
1.0,Didn't come close to fitting.....sent it back!
1.0,All i can say is you get what you pay.<br />Just received then yesterday and they look cheap and already peeled.
1.0,"This is NOT an outdoor jacket. The fabric is like a jacket liner or thin sweatshirt. Its looks are deceiving due to the fur hood, but this is a hoodie not a jacket."
1.0,Too large so I returned. Comfy thin material
1.0,Item was too big on me
1.0,I would not recommend.  Graphics are extremely blurry.  The small thumbnail is 100 times clearer than the actual product.
1.0,Runs very small and very thin cheap fabric
1.0,It looks like it was made with the shower curtain and made for a midget A good money forward I guess from right grandchild that he can't even wear it
1.0,"I didn't even put it on, one of the sleeves is completely ripped from the shoulder to the wrist.  How does that happen?"
1.0,Super cute. Broke in under a month on my key chain.
1.0,Terrible. Too small. Sizing way off.
1.0,Not worth it I got them for a fun joke but it wasn't even worth it.
1.0,Who ever made these pants was not thinking about the average American woman. The pants wouldn't fit my wife. They look like they fit on a little slim girl. The average American woman shouldn't purchase the pants. You will be very disappointed. My wife is 5'5 and 164 pounds
1.0,I did not receive the dress that is in this picture!!! Sending it back! So upset!
1.0,They don’t fit at all as pictured. They’re too big and don’t stay out. The stud falls down with its weight
1.0,Hands are open palm and loosely closed with low grade Velcro. Latex is thick. Fingers are hard to use and one thumb is significantly smaller than the other. Even a friend with skinny hands couldn't fit them. Good for a static but barely usable on a live person.
1.0,The claim is that this is water proof. My daughter wore it in Alaska and she was soaking wet both days. I was VERY disappointed in this product. Unfortunately I bought it well in advance of the TRIP so I CANNOT RETURN IT OR get a refund.
1.0,"Nothing like pictured. Has white inserts that show through the breast portion of dress. Has a weird elastic at the waist, not empire waist...all around just nothing like the pic and sizing is incorrect as well...just ugly compared to picture"
1.0,"I like the dress but I feel like this dresses are made for petite people even tho I know my size and order my size it just never feels right. I'm a medium size,  and every time I order my size it comes way to tight on my waist or it just small fit and if I order a bigger size than it just to big, mainly on the waist part of the body. This is the reason I'm returning most of the dresses back. I'm love all the dresses but I just wish they could work on making the right size, specially for tall woman."
1.0,Cheaply made nothing like the picture 👎👎👎👎
1.0,Wow!  Took them out of the packaging and slipped a pair on .... lo and behold you could see my big toe through the separating material. Finished wearing them for ONE DAY and my entire heel has come through the sock.  I have never owned a sock that performed more abysmally. I wore the socks to work - where I sat for nine hours. Not exactly a demanding sock environment. I am sending pictures as soon as I can figure out how to upload them.
1.0,Way to small for a 3xxl
1.0,0 stars for this item and seller ..<br /><br />Item is not as it is described and doesn't fit the watch it says it fits this item is junk don't waste your money like I did this seller is a LIAR
1.0,Won't stay on head during the night.
1.0,Simple no sirven así no sirven  los peores producto que e obtenido en línea y en Amazon terriblemente basura  así 0 no sirven
1.0,Cheaply made. Thin. Poor quality
1.0,The pants ripped and frayed on both sides. The seams were not stitched well
1.0,I ordered the smooth hoops. They were ok but I don't like the clasps. They don't click into the u-shaped clip very well.  They were inexpensive so I kept them. I will wear them occasionally until they break.
1.0,The stitching on the right sleeve has came apart. Very disappointed with this item.
1.0,Does not fit the fit bit flex 2 band :(  very disappointed.
1.0,This was not sweatshirt material. Was silky and awful!
1.0,The mask is too tight. It doesn't fit my head. The holes are not wide enough to see thru. I cut around the eyes to fit it.
1.0,So disappointed when this arrived....ordered one size up as I read the reviews on it running small but it STILL didn't fit.  Won't be ordering from the China distributors any longer.  This happened with a pair of ski pants too.  Only giving it one star because I have too.
1.0,"I bought this item in hopes that it would sincerely work. I went ahead and took a chance on it because of the ADVERTISED FREE RETURNS. Needless to say, it did not fit appropriately. The chest area was oddly shaped and would not sit right. I reached out to the seller about returning the item. 1. They DID NOT provide a prepaid postage label. 2. I returned it on my own at a cost of $14 in hopes to recover the majority of the cost. 3. I received a $13 refund with the following explanation:<br />Item Refund: $74.99<br />Item Tax Refund: $6.02<br />Item Promotion Deduction*: ($3.75)<br />Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($64.12)<br />I could've just kept the dress instead of wasting money to return, resulting in me LOSING MONEY!"
1.0,"One of the 3 chains arrived with a kink (bend) in it that could not be flattened out. The chains were also supposed to be 18 inches and they were closer to 17""."
1.0,"Edited to add: The stone fell out of one of the earrings from the second set yesterday (11/8). Definitely save your money and buy something better.<br /><br />These are such pretty little earrings, but the stones on one pair fell out. I ordered these on July 20 and the stones fell out sometime on September 2. I won’t be replacing these. The return window closed in August or I would return them."
1.0,"Although the fit was good and they were comfy, on Thanksgiving I spilt brine all over my floor and the slippers as well.  They did was well, however, afterwards any padding that was there was now gone.  I am walking on on the shoe bottom which is some kind of a square honey combed rubber base.  The his hurts my feet and leaves square indentations on my heels.  As a diabetic this is not good.  I plan on buying a better pair of slippers, ones with memory foam or gel and can stand up to a laundering."
1.0,"This is not what is been advertised!<br />This is. It 12 assorted colors!<br />Some the yarn is falling apart. The string are getting coming off. They are way to small. And repeated colors. Got 4 Blue, 2 dark blue, one purple, 3 white. And two dark gray.  That is not 12 assorted colors, nothing of what the picture advertised."
1.0,Crappy
1.0,Only half my order came through. There was no bead in the package.
1.0,"I ordered the St. Louis Cardinals Hat. Because I live in St. Louis and am a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals. I ordered on April 28th. I received the black New York Yankees hat on June 7th. I was so excited about my sparkly new hat, I didn't mind waiting a few weeks for it. When I opened the bag I was so disappointed. There is no return info, no paperwork, no tags on the hat. Just the wrong hat. Very sad day. I would not recommend purchasing from here."
1.0,"Shiny thick material, nothing like the picture.<br />Unflattering neckline. Because of the material, the tie dye pattern looks like the garment was accidentally washed with bleach- not a subtle effect."
1.0,The zipper is sewn in so that you can’t access it. Faulty. Had to pull dress over my head. Am returning
1.0,Costume did not light up upon arrival. My husband hooked up his multimeter and figured out it has at least two shorts somewhere in the wiring. Returned.<br /><br />Edited: Received a new costume. Turned it on... or tried to. It TOO did NOT work! Grr!!! It too is being returned and we are not trying again. Don't waste your time. These costumes are pieces of junk.
1.0,"Doesn't fit at all, don't buy it."
1.0,I ordered 2 of them because I loved the first one not too heavy does NOT hurt my ears and the wolf picture on the front was beautiful.  I ordered my second one and.......still waiting and waiting for it to be delivered. 😕🥱
1.0,"Just received the Imperial robe as a Christmas gift.  The robe itself seems nice enough, however, the embroidery was utter garbage.  It looks nothing like the Imperial logo.  Will be returning/exchanging.  Will update my review after replacement robe is received."
1.0,Makes you look pregnant.
1.0,Springbar holes were drilled way too close to the bottom of the clasp (almost to the point where it would be more of a notch than a hole)
1.0,Does not match the picture. I ordered the purple and it looks tan. Very little color and it may be a slight pink. Not as pictured. I will not buy again.
1.0,The straps we super wide and the dress was not at all flattering. It made me look like a bug round ball with browd shoulders
1.0,"Lens portion of glasses is distorted, making it very difficult to use.  I threw them out."
1.0,"this is a waste of money. the bracelet changed color after wearing just 2 days, it is an anklet so it is supposed to be worn, but not this one. I sent to my nieces and am embarrassed to ask them to send them to me so I can return them, so I wont. Will never order jewelry again."
1.0,"They’re just okay.  Not very comfortable and they leak.  The fit is not great for an adult male.  They are a little narrow.  That probably accounts for the leaking.  They’re probably better for females or children.<br /><br />Upon further review, these are in now way suitable for adult male.  I tried swimming with these again and the pinch terribly and leak."
1.0,Quality of the workmanship of the fleece is flawed. I brought this to the companies attention and they referred me back to Amazon. I would hope they would have more interest in their products quality. Do not buy this item the quality is bad and the company doesn’t care.
1.0,charged a 9 restocking fee and I had to pay for the postage to return
1.0,Broken and lost pieces in less then 3 months. very poor manufacturing not happy and will not buy from this seller again.
1.0,"Opened case, one arm not attached. Arm and small screw in case but screw will not tighten, arm is stripped."
1.0,So CHEAPLY made.  Not even worth the $ they're asking - awful.
1.0,"I received the sweater today and I was very eager for it to come.<br />Once it came, I was extremely excited until I realized the horrendous material it was in. It’s so cheap and the entire sweater can fall apart when washed just once. It’s also extremely difficult to zip up, very see through. This is more of a Halloween costume than an everyday sweater you can wear in public. It’s just horrible. It looks nothing like the picture. Please don’t waste your time by buying this product like I did find a way better one."
1.0,Not only is this bag incredibly tiny but the zipper was put on so that when you zip it the bag will not go flat.
1.0,The clasp actually broke when I tried to fasten it. Such a pity I didn't even get to try it on.
1.0,Broke within the first week.
1.0,Was broken when it arrived. Had to return it. I would not buy again
1.0,"Excellent fit (like a glove), comfortable but lasted 1 and a half days. I work at UPS as a package handler in the morning. Before the end of my shift on the second day, glove finger tips were worn out (some had holes). The palms fared no better. Comfortable but a waste of money for the price. I'll stick to Pugs: last longer and are cheaper, even if  the fit is off."
1.0,"They hardly get dark at all, bright sunny day you will still squint and be blind from the light, great clarity at night but not even close to a transition lense"
1.0,There are three button designs on the front of the hoodie but when you zip it up they don't line poor craftsmanship if u ask me
1.0,Not at all warm and sort of scratchy. I have sheepskin boots I love - these gloves are awful. Put them on tonite - it's 18 (last nite it was 4) and my fingers were so cold they hurt in record time.
1.0,Not worth buying.  Its doesn't really do any thing. Very small and cheap.
1.0,"After about one week of wearing it, the leather starts to separate. Looks nice, but inferior quality."
1.0,Ran small and wasn’t very flattering on. The mastery was not the best quality
1.0,If you are small get it xs it run big
1.0,Horrible y corriente tela
1.0,Didn't like this at all!  Satanic!  Threw it away!  No stars
1.0,This skirt was made for a woman size 2.  Medium was way too small.  I normally wear a medium and am a size 6.
1.0,"Using and comparing with some magnifiers I own, I tested and found that these are between 10 and 12 power. The Chinese marketers tend to exaggerate their products a lot. SEEMS TO BE A TREND WITH ALL CHINESE PRODUCTS. Not bad for the price, but I wanted 30 power. Too cheap to return catagory."
1.0,"Sleeves too tight, heavy dress, sent back"
1.0,Too thin and unfinished. Not hemmed at the ends as I'd expect. I got one pack of these and another pack of a similar item and the other set was superior. Threw these out almost immediately.
1.0,Pretty design and comfortable fabric but bodice is very loose and low cut.  When pinning it closed looked the top looked funny and awkward.  Had to return.
1.0,"The sweater is fine, except the pockets are sewn at an angle instead of normal.<br /><br />I’m disappointed because it throws the whole look off."
1.0,"I loved the look of this kimono, HOWEVER, it is so cheaply made that after just ONE time wearing it (to an office job...at a desk...absolutely no rough-use, etc) it is falling apart. The seams are all &#34;shredding&#34; (for lack of a better word) and pulling apart from each other. I don't know if it's because the material is so thin that it the stitching can't hold it or if the stitching was done wrong. In any case, it's useless now."
1.0,No sirvió pésima Calidad
1.0,This item was way too big and it looks nothing the picture shown on model or the other pictures. The sleeves shown are not the sleeves I have. I ordered the blue and the color is great just the shaping and being too big ruined it. I will be sending back.
1.0,The butterfly cardigan clip arrived broken. The item is very low quality.
1.0,Colors ran in the shipping package.  Not a good gift. Fit is ok but who cares if they look horrible.
1.0,This is a fine quality sweater but the sizing is completely off. I ordered a X-large which is a 44 to 46 in chest size.<br />I could not even put the sweater on because of the size. The size is a medium which fits a 38 to 40 chest.<br />So I gave it to my son.
1.0,Runs extremely small!!!
1.0,Disappointed. Too small.
1.0,Demasiado pequeño pedí una xl y parecía una s  no lo recomiendo
1.0,I have ordered from this brand before and been very happy. This time when I washed them they shrunk to less than half the size they started :(
1.0,"I love this piece_it was a Christmas gift.<br /><br />The design is BAD. I think the gauge is smaller than standard, thus the irritation caused at piercing site. The closure threads are too short/too few so after a few hours of wearing it fell off and was lost. Because its hollow I believe the threads miss align as well so the (5) additional ""balls"" i have purchased so I could wear this beautiful GIFT have promptly fallen off and been lost!!!!!!!<br /><br />As much as I love it DO NOT BUY THIS"
1.0,Very uncomfortable even if I purchase two sizes larger it wouldn't be to my liking and I'm one whose easy to please
1.0,I never get headaches so when I did was pretty scared something might be seriously wrong.  Went to the doctor who ordered a CT scan and thankfully no tumors or anything.  That's when I realized the headaches started right after I started using these glasses.  I've thrown them all away and not a single headache since.
1.0,"Made to fit a giant, I think!"
1.0,"The pants seem to be cut for a man - the crotch has extra fabric, drawing attention to the crotch area and it does not look well at all. I would be embarrassed to wear them and want to return them. Other than this, I would have really liked the pants, fabric is a good weight, color is what I want, and size - waist, hip, leg length were all very good."
1.0,The chain loosens paint on my neck ! And give me allergy !
1.0,Worst product ever the gold change color to black the buckle keep separating i want my money back
1.0,Very tight and not much give to the material. I'm almost afraid to wash even in cold water. I know I can't use a dryer. I will update after washing.
1.0,The waist was a little too tight that they would be uncomfortable to try and deal with. Not worth it so they were returned.
1.0,Don’t buy this one the clasp is broken or defective. I can’t get it to open or close so I can’t get it on or off. So annoying!!
1.0,Huge.  Manly
1.0,Ordered the XXL fit like a XS
1.0,"At first I loved this shirt. It was soft, comfortable, and flattering. After one wash it looks horrible!! The color has faded, the fabric has pilled. Do NOT buy! Not so flattering anymore."
1.0,This tunic fit me way to big and was so cheaply made I don’t recommend this tunic
1.0,"Holy moly, do not waste your money on this dress!!! It runs small. Cheap material , see through, just over all horrendous.  I always order up in size, when I buy from Amazon.  And this is the 1st time I have been absolutely disappointed. I love the design of the dress."
1.0,"This band is really cute. I had to take out a few links when I received it because it was a bit too big, and it was a big pain to do. The instructions weren’t too clear, but I eventually got it figured out. I wore it for a couple weeks, and it broke.  Overall it’s super cheap and I don’t recommend. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"The quality is ok, but its a tedious process to remove cards from the card holder. Totally defeats the purpose of carrying a wallet, when it's not that convenient to use."
1.0,"This balaclava is to small for my 11 months old baby. It  fitted well on her head but didn't fit on her face, the hole for face is to small and it has none elastic band."
1.0,Wrist ban is small and uncomfortable. Sweats up the wrist pretty quick and after a week started getting destroyed and ruined.
1.0,"These jeans came on time, my problem is they are very small and tight on my fiance'. He couldn't even pull them up. I won't be buying from this company again and wouldn't recommend them either."
1.0,ordered this to go with the excellent hoodie .. unfortuneatly when it arrived it had morphed into two nissan keychains ..  HUH?
1.0,"Item looked great in box! When it was time to remove links, there was an included tool, but it was almost impossible to do!!! After wearing it only a handful of times, the place where the band connects to the smart watch has completely fallen apart. Very bad quality."
1.0,The propeller was broke off when we opened. Had to give it to my brothers surprise birthday party the way it was.
1.0,"If you have a paunch, this underwear is not for you.  It folds under the belly.  I have purchased invisible undies before but these are cheap. Not happy....I gave them away!"
1.0,Came tarnished and I refuse to wear it after no customer support or option to return. Looks cheap and has an ugly over sized chain. I tried to shine it but because none of the materials are real it still wont shine.
1.0,Fell apart the first day. As soon as I put it on my keys. I love this and it is beautiful but i wish it stayed together better.
1.0,These glasses feel like either cheap kids glasses or glasses you would find in the dollar store or at a gas station. Super light and bendable they are also too dark for me to see during the daytime and I have greater than 20/20 vision at 20/15. Also I Can’t see gps and my view in driving in general is too dark to bare or drive safely while wearing. Its a I do not recommend rating from me!!
1.0,Tag says 65% polyester 35% cotton<br />The description of the item says 100% cotton.
1.0,"this shirt was really cute. too bad a large fits like a small... there was no hope of closing the shirt, especially with having a larger bust. I will be returning this."
1.0,I ordered this for my 6’6 husband and it doesn’t even fit me and I’m 5’5. It’s cheaply made and smelled bad. It looked nothing like advertised
1.0,My tickler refuses to wear the sweat pants for some reason. Says it bothers him around his ankles.  He doesn’t complain about any other sweat pants we own.  The image on the sweater completely faded after 1 wash.
1.0,"We purchased this dress for my daughter who was a flower girl in a wedding. My daughter tried it on and it looked beautiful. On the day of the wedding, which was outside, I noticed that the ivory dress had one whole panel of lace(a quarter of the dress that was bright white. It was not noticeable in the house but very noticeable outside."
1.0,The dress is not the same material or pattern as the one in the picture. Very cheep material and the size was way too small.
1.0,This skirt is for a preteen. And the fabric is thin and flimsy. The only thing that was good was the color
1.0,This was not at all as pictured.  The material is not sweatshirt material.  It's some kind of nylon with a lining and a tight band around the bottom.  I returned it.
1.0,"Never got the product-USPS said my address did not exist- returned to you-I asked that the address be changed to 120 Fayton Ave, Norfolk, Va 23505"
1.0,Not cut right. Not right fit. Cheaply made
1.0,These smell like your grandma's attic. They are dusty and appear to be made of pieces of curtains out pillows
1.0,The fit was too large in the top so I returned it.
1.0,Didnt help with keeping my shoulder held back at all.
1.0,I bought these fun socks for my niece and it wasn't until she sent this close-up pic that we realized one of the patterns was a swastika. Not happy at all. All pairs went into the trash.
1.0,"The pants looked NOTHING like the picture, cheap fabric/material, poor fit, too short, going back ASAP"
1.0,i bought this keychain and it broke after one week
1.0,It was alright. I sent it to a family member in Haiti.
1.0,"As so many others have said, this blouse is much shorter than what's shown.  The stitching around the cold shoulders puckered, and the fit was so unflattering."
1.0,"I ordered these for Halloween so I am not trying to complain to the seller and I am not sending them back. The four metal shoelace hooks at the top of one of them all fell out before I put them on. I do not expect them to wear well, but for the price and for what I am using them for I'm fine with it. Just trying to warn anyone who thinks they might get some use out of them."
1.0,These pajamas hug your body too tight. The XL has no give way. These are not comfortable.  Would not recommend  these.
1.0,I personally was very disappointed.  I ordered the blue#5 and it doesn't even have any blue in it.  Sleeves too short and collar isn't near what it shows in the pictures. I would never order from this company again.!!!!
1.0,"i have another set exactly the same thing, but 4 times the size, these are very tiny, and not worth the price for being so small"
1.0,Disappointed. The Luigi hat was good but Mario is defective
1.0,Not the same as pictured.
1.0,Material is cheap and thin. Came in a very nice case and a repair tool however i can tell they won't be lasting long
1.0,They came with holes in them. The buttons holding down the mittens came off. Your thumb is completely exposed. One mitten came off just two days into wearing them and the holes just grew bigger.
1.0,Order this product in a red wine color. And I actually received a pure red coat and the material is spandex stretchy material and the shoulder pads are just a strip of black material that was sewn on the shoulder giving no shoulder pad image at all. When I tried it on and look nothing like the picture I would never buy this product again don't recommend it and will be returning it
1.0,"The item description states that this storage case is leather (at least the outside of it, the inside is stated as imitation suede). Well, the outside is definitely NOT leather, but quite cheap looking &#34;leatherette&#34;, which is imitation (fake) leather. It's very obvious too. It does not look like leather. Does not smell like leather. Cheaply made too - leatherette sides are glued on, and you can see traces of the glue on the outside. I am extremely disappointed and can't believe that I just paid that much for a cheap box that I can buy literally for a few bucks in chinatown."
1.0,The quality was quite poor. The color faded within a few washes. Even the fabric has worn out in probably 1/10th the time of other shorts that I have used.
1.0,"I'm sure it won't be on phone long, String is Very Thin!"
1.0,It has a bad smell when you open it and use it
1.0,"Shirt arrived extremely faded, not like the picture on the Amazon website.  Am sending it back.  I bought three other Banksey shirts from other suppliers, the printing was excellent, all washed well, no shrink. First photo off website, second actual product."
1.0,terrible
1.0,Just No! Just got it and straight out of package...and it's broken.  The string of the necklace was literally superglued into a cheap metal clasp
1.0,"Miss sized --  I ordered the size I usually wear in this type of sandal -- these were falling off my feet, They also have little to no arch support and they stink! I was going to return them but it said they could not be returned. It does NOT say that anywhere on the product page or order. However, Amazon did refund me the money. Guess the sandals will now go to Goodwill -- maybe somebody can use them."
1.0,"Small is a factor but the real problem is the image is misprinted. Oh, yeah, let me get off work early to pay to mail you back $7 socks, sounds like a fantastic use of my time. or. Or! OR! You could just do it right the first time."
1.0,It break the 1 day .even he couldn't wear it for his birthday
1.0,Definitely not as pictured smh..color & fabric was awful & maybe should be categorized as a baby doll Blouse ..not even close to a dress
1.0,Not at all like in photo
1.0,I bought this product but as soon as it delivered I quickly realized that the clamps don’t even open! They’re also made very cheaply. Do not buy this product!!!
1.0,flower is torn off!
1.0,"Loved the bag when I first got it, but after a week, it started to fall apart. The zipper broke, the straps became undone and would not stay. Soon the straps also began to fray on the edges. Not sure if it was just this particular purse, but the one I received was not well made and did not hold up."
1.0,It fell apart the first time I touched it
1.0,"Never wore, first wash in cold water on a gentle cycle... holes in all the letters on the top of the shirt.  Never seen anything like this. Don’t buy."
1.0,this wallet is so small its like a kids wallet and the leather looks plastic.I cant believed i paid $18.00 plus 8 dollar shipping for this it was a present for my husband and i was so embrassed when he got it. Just awful I would not recommend this to anyone at all for a man.I feel very cheated out of my money
1.0,Not plus size friendly. Wouldn’t recommend
1.0,I put the earrings on and not even 20 minutes later I reached for my ear and the feather was gone. Shortly after the noticed the other one was on the ground. The hook remained in my ear but the feather came off. I didn’t even get to wear them for the maternity pics that I purchased them from
1.0,Pants have a draw string waist and the string was out. I ordered 14/16 for a 13 year old and the pants looked like they would fit a 6/7 year old. Disappointing!
1.0,"It doesn't look at all how it does here. The ring sticks out awkwardly and you can't even see the diamonds. The top part of the belly ring is just normal metal and the rest of it, all FOUR diamonds, just stick out weirdly and poke through shirts and you can't even see it because of the angle. Wouldn't recommend it."
1.0,"They were great, but then they broke at the hinge."
1.0,Stitching was off. Looked very cheaply made. Returned immediately
1.0,I ordered a larger size than my child usually wears. He just turned 9 and was excited to get this. Very disappointed because it fits like maybe a size 6 boys instead of a XL. He normally wears a large (10/12) in boys. Not even going to put his heigh and weight for comparison It’s no where even close to correct size.
1.0,Fits small size
1.0,They were broken when I received them.
1.0,"Chain gets knotted a lot, cute chain, but be careful how you store it , it gets tangled."
1.0,Black bracket will not lock and stay closed. Waiting on response from seller
1.0,The soles are very soft. The curved bottom flattens against the ground so that the footbed presses hard against the bottom of the foot.<br /><br />Athlefit Unisex Slide Sandals Arch Support Comfort Slides Adjustable Eva Double Buckle Straps Slides
1.0,"The photo looks so cute...but after receiving these, I don't think grandson will be wearing these for very long.  They feel extremely cheap and paper like thin.  Lining in the footbed just pops out....don't like these at all.  The free socks that came with them were of better quality."
1.0,"I prefer a metal band over a rubber watchband, so when I saw this I ordered one right away. I had left my brand new watch in its packaging until the band arrived. Very disappointed that the width of the bands was not even close to fitting thre Blackview x1 smartwatch. I see the ad is still up. I had to return, would not fit. Recommended you pass unless you enjoy letdowns..."
1.0,"A very stylish, sleek wallet but the metal zipper broke within 2 days. Cheaply made."
1.0,The watch would never keep the correct time.... Ever
1.0,it is not like it shows in the pictures at all. feels like a very cheap material and is very thin
1.0,The closure just doesn’t stay it’s not a dock closure like the actual Apple Watch wristbands it’s different bulky uncomfortable don’t buy
1.0,Did not like run small. Did not like it.
1.0,Very flimsy and glare resistance is non-existent.  I can not recommend.
1.0,"The fabric is very wrinkled, the different color is more brown than red, not as seen in the photo."
1.0,Came EXTREMELY tiny. I am not a big girl I am 5&#34;4' 140lbs small waist i have a booty and this is not made for girls who have curves at all. My tits didnt even fit. Once i forced myself into it I had to cut the strings off across the bottom pull it up like a thong in between my butt cheeks. It ended up looking cute like that but still just know that this defiantly not for a woman's body. Its made for a teenage boy type body.
1.0,This watch was delivered July 2nd and has already broken... it’s only July 10th
1.0,"THIS DRESS IS AWFUL......IT CAME MONTHS AFTER I ORDERED IT AND NOW I CAN""T RETURN IT!!! DO NOT WASTE Your MONEY!!!!"
1.0,this never arrived. all others were great! It might have been nice but who knows !
1.0,Worn once.  Laundered once.  All ready have lots of little wear balls showing on the heels.  All ready Look OLD and nasty.  I will Never buy these again.  Total waste of money.
1.0,"Very unsteady.  If two kids actually use it, someone is going to fall."
1.0,Handbags not from Michael kors. I see from China. I’m not happy. I want return
1.0,Want to love this bag but I am now getting ready to purchase a THIRD pair of handles in less than 2 years!
1.0,A pretty bracelet however clasp doesn't work.
1.0,I would not recommend this material is to thin and looks cheap. I would like to send this back.
1.0,Broke after one day of wearing it
1.0,Not accurate on size at all
1.0,They won't provide labels to return items. The item had a price tag but it looked used on the inside. Hair and glitter
1.0,[[VIDEOID:917703fc75a044d7ccacdf2100e47340]] La verdad no es lo que esperaba es demaseado sencillo para el precio<br />Es de muy mala calidad lo queria usar para mi boda y claro que no podre usar eso
1.0,This cardigan is about the thickness of cheesecloth! You can literally see through it. Very disappointed!
1.0,To small to tight to hard to get on. 2 1/2 hrs to get on. Elastic band  at top was so tight created a 1/2 deep depression all the way around the top part of my leg.
1.0,"Poor quality.  Embroidery terrible, crooked. For the price, should be more like Amazon photo"
1.0,Would fit my baby cousin three year old not me.
1.0,Don't  waste  your  money. Not wool. Cheap material from. CHINA
1.0,"You will not receive the mask shown in the listing. The mask I received is flimsy, and very distorted...vs a hard plastic like it is supposed to be. The smell is also horrific. Scam!"
1.0,missing part!!!!! really!!!!! i guess thats why it is $18. should of know better. thanks cross land company!!!
1.0,Fabric is terrible scratchy. The thing comes unlaced for $30. Sat down to lace front and back. Front left panel loops were smaller than the rest and near impossible to lace through. Tried it on and it is TIGHT. I sized up and went by measurement guide. The ties were also to short. DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH. It feels like a cheap costume. I have no earthly how it has good reviews...
1.0,"Ordered these twice, thinking the first pair was just a fluke that they broke so easily. Second pair broke in the same spot within 2 weeks."
1.0,Awful and it took 2 months to get here
1.0,"I bought this dress back in November to wear for Christmas.  I wore it to Christmas with my husband's family and looked down and noticed that it was torn.  It actually looks like it was cut with a cutter.  This is my first time wearing it, so there is no way that I could have done this.  It must have come this way.  And, the cut is right on the bodice."
1.0,Smooshed my breast and makes the bulgur out the sides.  Not good for DD size and up.
1.0,Broke at school when my granddaughter wore them the first time
1.0,Fits too big and I bought a small
1.0,The dress I received cannot be the product pictured. The length goes to the floor and the sleeves are MUCH shorter than pictured.
1.0,"Very badly made, bend very easily and lenses smudge."
1.0,"It is just darling.  Unfortunately, day 1 two of the little &#34;crystals&#34; have fallen out."
1.0,Horrible looks nothing like pic very beat up
1.0,"Arrived with clasp and chain broken, completely unusable. Shipping bag was very thin and I am sure it broke in transit.  Shipped from another country so not worth the return.  It also is made for very small wrist."
1.0,Bars are way to short cause alot of swelling
1.0,Bad quality. Not like picture. Very stretchy and short. Not long like the picture.
1.0,I was really excited to get these leggings. The color was beautiful and although there was not much of a compression factor to them I still liked them. Until I put them into their first delicate cycle and hung them up to dry. The entire inner thigh seam was unraveled and there is a huge hole and they will likely go in the trash after one wear to the gym. Not a product I would recommend.
1.0,Quality was good was way too small. Returned and waiting for refund. If I receive I will re-evaluate.
1.0,"They do not stick at all, couldn't grasp men little boobies lol"
1.0,"I did not receive all of the pairs. Looking back at the reviews, I’m not the only one…"
1.0,Ugh. Cheap material. Not well made.
1.0,"I really want to like these, but they just don’t suit my body type. They ride up way higher than I expected, very uncomfortable and not good for professional dress"
1.0,This was by far the worse material made looked straight out of poverty. Nothing at all like picture lucky for me I was able to return it
1.0,Bought this at a discount but wasn’t worth the $2. The ring is bulky and the edges are hard. It’s too uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,After reading the reviews I went up one size. It was still thin around the chest but wide in the shoulders. The front ruffle falls open so you can see white lining. The material looked really cheap. It was not flattering.
1.0,"Very cheap quality. When removing it from packaging it was folded in a very unprofessional manner. As I opened and went to put it on it instantly ripped all the way up the back. The wig is very loosely glued, and loses hair quickly very hard to breathe in and extremely hard to see in. Would not recommend it to anyone"
1.0,"They tarnished, very poor quality. Made my ear lobes itch. Shouldn't get any stars."
1.0,"UPDATED REVIEW - I purchased this bag for myself and the black one for my daughter. I loved it for the first couple of months. Then the lining in both began to tear. It tore all the way across the seams in both bags. It was a mess. We finally cut the liners out but now have no inner compartments as they were built in to the liner. Also, on my daughter's black bag, the main zipper came off because the end of the zipper track was not sewn down properly. I wish the bags would have held up better. I would have bought them again and used forever."
1.0,"The product was awful for me. The item arrived MUCH later than when it was purchased, also, I'm usually a medium in bikini tops, the top didn't even cover my full chest. The bottom half of my breasts were exposed. I was shocked to see reviews of other people's items being exactly as described and a good fit, so maybe the one I got was just defective? I'm not entirely sure. I will be returning mine."
1.0,Cheap looking. The “diamond” is actually nice but the band looks like tin foil.
1.0,Runs small and fabric is very poor quality. Guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Look nothing like the photo!!
1.0,"Don’t stay on, already ripping apart wore once."
1.0,"First they were oddly large and as we were handling them noting how awkward they looked, they fell apart like almost immediately. Zero stars."
1.0,It's Christmas and my Auny Never re ceived her cat necklace? Please send her the cat necklace JoAnn Cavazos
1.0,"Did not fit, unable to return."
1.0,Grandson did not like loose style.  Material was too stiff.
1.0,Sized more for girls than misses.  Very tiny.
1.0,I ordered a 4x  It’s only around a XL fit :-(
1.0,It is not good at all. It was slipping from my daughter’s feet.
1.0,I wanted to love it but it was too small for me I got a D thinking it was going to fit but sadly it didn't
1.0,Got it use it one time and then the battery exploded inside.
1.0,"gloves did not have the three stitch pattern in the picture, poorly stitched and material is waaaaay thin it looks like your wearing dirty white gloves. I'd turn in for a refund but the time I would put in to returning a $5 pair of gloves isn't worth it. I could probably overlook it being poorly stitched and thin material if the gloves at least had the stitch pattern that is shown in the picture.<br />Definitely false advertising."
1.0,shrunk right after i got it
1.0,"Very beautiful set, loved it but broke after I wore it just once, dissapointed.Would never buy from this brand."
1.0,Very cheaply made !!! Returned it
1.0,Was not worth it and does not look as it was advertised. The picture is hard to make out when you get the actual shirt and it looks like terrible!
1.0,"Tried to set lock, plastic pieces broke.  Not worth 30 bucks."
1.0,The wallet arrived in poor quality. The front was scratched and it has a tiny dark spot where a piece of leather is missing. At first glance the dark spot looks like a pen mark but upon closer inspection you can tell it was poked or scratched and a piece of leather came off. I tried rubbing it with leather conditioner to rub out some of the scratch marks but it did not help very much. I would not recommend this item.
1.0,I wanted to like this product but it runs way small. I returned it for one size up and it fits much better.  I washed it one time per the instructions and it now has a hole in it. I am disappointed.
1.0,Not true size. Too small and itchy.
1.0,"Very funny but it tore the 2nd time I put it on, very fragile"
1.0,Size up for everyone
1.0,"Run small, had to return.. poor quality"
1.0,They are hard to hold on to and some of them weren't even usable because there was no hole in the center.
1.0,I would recommend ordering a size down because this was HUGE on me. It was beautiful and comfortable...just much too large.
1.0,The off set emblems really messed up the shape of the hat. Sorry
1.0,Changed color while wearing it left green on neck
1.0,"I had high hopes for this sweater based on the other reviews. Sadly, this sweater did not work for me  at all. It's pictured as fitting the model perfectly. Unfortunately, this sweater was both huge and short on me. I am 5'10'', so it might fit a shorter person much better lengthwise. The sleeves and the collar were immensely bulky, unflattering and uncomfortable instead of stylishly oversized as I hoped. The material and color were both of decent quality for the price but that was not enough to sway me into keeping the sweater."
1.0,Never arrived!
1.0,It came with broken hands.
1.0,"It doesn't fit my industrial piercing, then angle of the cross or however it was fitted makes it impossible to fit into my ear, not to mention it looks cheap and glued on."
1.0,I bought these capa for me and my daughter. They fit great but within 2 weeks the material had torn and there was a hole in the exact same spot for both of ours.
1.0,It not large because it’s very small l just try it on so upset about this 🥶 Please be careful about this dress
1.0,Pins were not in bands which were not easy to insert. Also the band was difficult to assemble onto watch. Won't be changing.
1.0,"Purchased this a couple days ago, came earlier than expected which is great. I ordered and XXL and the size on the item was correct but it fits like a medium and its very very short. I'd didn't come with a hood as advertised."
1.0,"These slippers were delivered on Wednesday. Today is Saturday, and one of them came apart because the stitching hadn’t been secured. I can fix this, but I shouldn’t have to on a third day of wearing them. Sloppy workmanship."
1.0,"The fit is very odd.. I ordered a medium, and it is HUGE in the chest. Mind you, I wear a 36D.. Maybe a small would fit better, but I’m not going to bother returning it to find out."
1.0,Very much to small more like a size small<br />Love the design and the color
1.0,"It was tiny, Half the size of my pinky.<br />Barely recognize the letter.😟<br />Needed a Magnifying glass to see it better."
1.0,"Sleeves are too tight, the rest fit fine. I am returning it though because the fabric looks cheap."
1.0,WHY do they not have a -0 for reviews? These socks are paper thin. The grippers are so hard they hurt your feet. You can feel them right thru the socks. Horrible. 8.99: I guess you get what you pay for. Lesson learned.
1.0,No way these socks stretch enough to get them on at all
1.0,The links on my watch broke within 24 hours of use.
1.0,"Color was great, too small! I don’t have a big head! This cap was just too small!"
1.0,Buckle broke in less than a week
1.0,Thes are like cutouts from foam. Not comfortable. Not worth it.
1.0,I wear a size 12 and there was no way the pants were a large!
1.0,Opened the package and realized the quality was poor. Sent them back immediately.
1.0,Awful!  I was so excited to get these.  Put them as soon as they arrived. One hour later I noticed one earring was gone.  Only the post and backing was left in my ear. Completely broke off! Now I’m left with one useless earring.
1.0,It's a piece of crap.
1.0,"Too small, doesn’t fit properly, back buttons are stiched incorrectly... at firt thought brought small size and even ordered two sizes big and came out to be small too"
1.0,"Not sized for  American women!  I’m a size large shirt size, bought this in extra large to exercise outdoors in comfort, but couldn’t even close it to zip!<br /><br />Please! Sizes need to be listed separately for American women and Asian women, I’m tired of items that are not sized for adult women, this is like a youth size, very disappointing!"
1.0,I thought i was getting what was pictured a cute pink one. No freaking ugly purple. Ugh im so mad. Its absolutely not like the picture. Why would they list this and send something totally different.
1.0,Malas muy mala
1.0,Se rompió la correa a los 3 meses
1.0,The dress looks nothing like what's in the picture. It is not made made from the ribbed material like I expected amd does no fit well.
1.0,"The dress is thin material and the lace on the sleeves is way too long.  Per the company guidelines, they instruct you to measure before ordering.  I measured and ordered 0x, which should have been flowing, yet it was tight in the bust & hips.  The company charges a restocking fee on returns as well as does not pay for return postage, so definitely measure and order much larger than your measurements."
1.0,Heavey and very hard. My kid didn't like it.
1.0,Surprisingly this was like a dress. A very stretched out dress. Not for me.
1.0,"The hole for the head is extremely small and has no stretch when it comes to the ruffle hem at the top. As soon as I put it over my head, the hem broke and flayed the stitching on the shirt. I had to stitch it back in different places even to wear it and it ripped of course again when removing the shirt. There is also no front or back of this shirt."
1.0,This adult Onsie Needs Stitching Work the way it's made the inside stitching thread near the zipper bottom area rubs against the skin I gifted this to someone and had to return it because it cut their skin on the inside of their legs I was so sad because I didn't know nor was I willing to do the sewing changes myself so I just decided to return it!!
1.0,"Never worked properly.  Every once in awhile it runs but never for long.  Oh well, you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Bought this suit ,Ordered a 4Xl and its more like a 2xl, Top doesnt fit and pants tore as i was putting them on, Shipping came before expected, Dont waste your time or money on this inferior product."
1.0,"This is not a knit fabric, so I cannot describe this garment as a sweatshirt.  I would not even describe the fabric as garment grade.  If you have ever used those disposable kitchen towels called Handi-Wipes, you'll know what this flimsy, ultra-thin fabric feels like.  And, weirdly, it doesn't breathe, making it hot and useless for summer wear -- assuming the shirt holds together long enough to last through a day.  Its best use will be as expensive, disposable kitchen towels after I've cut it up.  Sadly, I bought two to give as Father's Day gifts.  Keep shopping; these shirts will disapppoint."
1.0,Who ever embroidered Los Angeles should wear glasses and use a ruler...the embroidery is slanted and off balance
1.0,"The product that arrived was not the product shown in the picture. The one I got was gold plated and very shiny. I needed the antique brass finish shown in the picture so it would match with the rest of the antique brass on my cosplay, not a shiny gold one -_-"
1.0,"It said new on the ad ,it wasn’t new !!the tag had been cut off and it was dirty🤬 don’t buy from this place !!!!!!"
1.0,Was painted over stones and really looks nothing like the pictures
1.0,"Really weird fit. Seems to be made for a 6 ft. tall 80 lb. person, also started falling apart at turtle neck seam after first washing."
1.0,Extremely cheap construction. almost as if they were made out of tissue paper. Belt loops rip off easily and one wide legged squat picking up something heavy and the crotch is blown out.  Upside is that I never had to wash them cause they only lasted one wear.
1.0,This product was so tiny but very well made!
1.0,I bought these because I thought they would fit loose on the thighs but they are skin tight. I bought my usual size.
1.0,It came out dirty ! As soon as I open the package I saw dirt inside the bag
1.0,The magnet don't stay attach to eat the earrings come off to easily need more magnetic force to keep them in your ears
1.0,"I didn't mind that the seem was in the front, however, it was not centered to my chest but 3 inches to the left. It looked awful. Other than that, everything was good."
1.0,"The fabric is comfortable but the fit is terrible! I wear a small and am 5'3"". The torso on this outfit 'just"" fit and my torso is not long but proportionate. If I was a little taller it would have been to small in the torso. It just has an overall bad cut and looks very cheap! I returned it."
1.0,Super cheap thing material. Just feels wrong. Didnt even put them on.
1.0,"Look pretty cool, though such sharp lenses they sctuelly cut my nose first time wearing ! They are going back"
1.0,They dont look like they do on here but let's see when I put them on me see if there any good lol
1.0,Not as described... the back of the earing was broke off<br />.
1.0,Item was stained and stunk. It was supposedly new.
1.0,"They fit good, but when I started walking, they kept sticking to my butt and legs..it's like a static feeling because of the material, so it's really uncomfortable and looks weird."
1.0,"After one wash, all the golden dots faded away. Even the fabric color is not blue anymore<br />Ver disappointed 😔"
1.0,Look at the title
1.0,"The fit was extremly loose, way too large. My husband is 6'1 200lbs and it would fit him perfectly. It does not look like the picture."
1.0,Was going to return it (just arrived) but unfortunately I need it and don't want to wait for a replacement.  The packaging was great the product itself is substandard (see attached photos). I guess I will have to epoxy it so the glass doesn't fall out.
1.0,"Way too small!  This is NOT an XL, by any means!!!  Chinese people made it, so I guess they have a different view of what is XL."
1.0,Product arrived damaged and it was too big! The fabric was bulky and couldn’t breathe through it and it covered my whole entire face when I put it on! It also did not come with filters as stated in the description.
1.0,I returned this item. Print is completely different from what was advertised.
1.0,These earrings are awful. They were put together in a rush. Looks like something my 6yr old made in art class.Very disappointed!
1.0,"This coat was honestly just not worth the price, the fabric immediately starts to come apart anytime it is grabbed by anything. It already looks very ratty, and the hood is ridiculously large. I cannot wear the hood at all, because it makes me look like I just laid a blanket over my head, with half of It flopping over at all times to cover part of my face. It even looks ridiculous when it is hanging on your shoulders because I had to way too much bulk to your shoulders.<br /><br />My advice : don't buy it, look elsewhere"
1.0,I bought a Large shirt and its just  small like for a child. I don't know wich number i have to buy now... Want my money back.
1.0,Product color not as shown.  Quality was not as expected.
1.0,"I am disappointed with this product.<br />I bought 2 and one looked like it was opened and used.<br />They were Christmas presents so, I don’t know what to do.<br />Too late to send back for another.<br />Shopper beware."
1.0,The pin that goes through your piercing hole broke after less than a week.
1.0,Order 2 different colors. This pair was used and broken. The other pair returned had scratches and gashes. I paid for the shoes to be new. I had to have my spouse return their own gift and I bought a completely different flip flop and brand from an actual store.
1.0,The way this top was put together is very awkward. I don't reccomend buying these cheap tops online unless you're very thin.
1.0,I can't use it. It stunk so bad of a strong chemical bug spray smell. I have had it outside since March 10th 2016. It still reeks to bad inside and out. The smell gives me an asthma attack and my skin rashes out. I am so disgusted and upset. I could smell it through the shipping package when i got it. What is wrong with people making products with that kind of chemical and smell???? I cant use it and it wasnt worth trying to ship it back. I can't touch it. Now i am afraid to order anything from overseas and Prime makes it almost impossible to know where your orders are shipping from.
1.0,thought it was cheap looking...
1.0,"Women’s! Ha ha ha try teen/ junior!<br />My teen who is 5’3” and 120 pounds can wear this like the picture. I’m 5’9” and 180 pounds ,  can’t put it over my shoulders!"
1.0,The print was terrible. For the white they didn’t bother with a second pass and you can see through it.
1.0,For cheap it’s alright but 100% cheap. The gem in the middle was falling off and most of the ring was already green when I got it
1.0,Looks NOTHING like the picture!
1.0,"I didn't even put this on past a few top hooks as it did nothing but flatten the chest out not push it up for beautiful cleavage to show off!<br />I'm a 36DD so if you have boobs and want to show them off don't get this, is not like a corset at all!<br />Maybe someone with a small chest world like but mine is being returned for a refund!"
1.0,"Went 2 sizes under what I normally wear, still too loose. These suck"
1.0,"Don't know if too heavy. But kept coming unattached from Fitbit.  Very disappointed,  it is very pretty."
1.0,I bought these to wear cufflinks with regular shirts. They make cuff of the shirt look awkward and terrible. Returned and bought French cuff shirts.
1.0,Super strange fit
1.0,Awesome price
1.0,Had high hopes for this charm but received with a stone missing. Going back.
1.0,"The size, even two sizes up, is very small. I am a 34b and bought the 38b and it was still too small."
1.0,Got these for my wife and they looked great... problem they broke in about 2 months. Very cheaply made save your money and don't buy. They broke right down the middle. She kept them in a case and didn't drop them or anything. She went to put them on one day and snap right between the eyes and left a scratch on her nose.
1.0,Cheap as hell and has an extra random piece of chain dangling off the side. Can't even wear it!
1.0,"I need cushioning.  These had it.  BUT  when I tried them on, they were too wide even though they were medium.  Also the quailty of the shoe was not up to what I would have wanted paying so much for them.  To be honest, I sent them back right away because the material of the shoe felt cheap, like cardboard.  I wouldn't recommend these."
1.0,The ear plugs are nice looking but expensive and do it work as well as the cheap foam ones I got from a construction site. Very disappointing.
1.0,Item looks great but gave not received it as of yet
1.0,Zipper broke after the first wear
1.0,"The dress I received is not the same in the picture. My dress has a huge (wide) neckline and elbow-length sleeves. Also, it is missing the pictured pockets. I wanted to use this as part of a costume, and the dress I received will not work for that purpose."
1.0,"Very small, make sure you order 2 sized up if you plan to purchase these"
1.0,My hat says I Am Kroot. The item does not even deserve 1star.
1.0,This headpiece is a joke. It’s so small! I don’t have a giant head so I know it’s just plain small. Could fit on a child. Don’t waste your money. I bought a different headpiece from another site that fit perfectly. Too bad there is no return policy. Money down the drain.
1.0,Product looks cheap. It is too late for me to return it but I am unhappy with the quality.
1.0,The fit is odd.  Made more for a tall thin person than the average body
1.0,"I'm a fairly big guy and wear a 2X. I ordered this shirt in XXL, but it's too tapered and too small. When I crossed my arms across my body, I could hear the fabric trying to tear like the Hulk. Not good.<br /><br />The real hot mess about this though is the fabric. This garment arrived wadded up in a bag (not really folded). The wrinkles in the fabric were still there after washing. And since it's linen, it requires A TON of ironing to try to get the wrinkles out.<br /><br />I didn't bother trying to give it a third chance. Two strikes were enough to drop this into our Donation bag. It doesn't fit and the fabric is too wrinkled. Game over."
1.0,"This product is very cheap. My wife was very disappointed when I gave it to her as a gift because she loves her gems and crystals she reads and takes notes on all kinds! She is very intelligent even after a traumatic brain injury! My previous review was taken down because she believed it was a fake! It feels like plastic. I am having it looked at now to prove otherwise.  Look for my next review. Since they will probably remove this one as well. They have no concern about how to make a customer happy, even if the customer is wrong. Which I am NOT saying I am or my wife is. So with that said I do Not recommend this company to anyone who is looking for black obsidian! Also HORRIBLE Customer service!!!"
1.0,It smelled like some one else perfume and it had oil stains on it and it was light pink not dark pin like in the description
1.0,Only 1 of the 5 actually lights up and makes noises.  They are really cute though.
1.0,The short is smaller then expected. Sleeves are not long. They are 3/4.
1.0,This shirt looks cheap. The print looks like its gonna peel off after a wash. It's big too. Note that this is an oversized shirt. I returned
1.0,"I bought so I came to buy another purse just like it from the same people, I opened it today to see the zippers are different and the color is a faded black. I'm giving one star and not going to bother returning because I was so mad I tossed it into a filthy garbage can. Wish i could give negitive stars"
1.0,The size 10-12 were very small and fit my younger children who wear an 8.
1.0,Is very short I really disappointed
1.0,These shoes are terrible they hurt my feet I would like a refund
1.0,"CLASSY LOOKING DRESS, BUT FABRIC WAS SO CHEAP AND I RETURNED IT"
1.0,"changes after some time, and cleaning does not stop it, had to buy another one"
1.0,Wore for about a week and a half and the turquoise ball feel off.
1.0,"Don't buy these according the the sizing instructions. We carefully measured our glasses and picked the appropriately sized clip ons, according the the sizing directions. Both sets were way too large, falling off the glasses without pulling out the extensions at all. And now I'm a day late in requesting a return, so I'm stuck with 2 sets I can't use."
1.0,Order a youth medium and looks too small
1.0,Does no good if you can't breathe through it
1.0,"Had them for a week and broke , wore them two times. Didn't sit in them or anything , went in a store came back and busted"
1.0,It wasnt what i ordered and it was too big. Im very disappointed. I wanted ot to wear on a cruise for my first wedding anniversary
1.0,Such a weird fit. It creates gaps and is not true to size. It left air pockets
1.0,These shorts are the worst. the fit is poor. They look so cheap.
1.0,"I need them to stay put. I need them to help the shoe not slip so I keep putting them on. However, after a few hours the elastic just isn't up for the full day task."
1.0,Not what I expected not a compresión shirt at all
1.0,Way too small. Arm holes made for a man!
1.0,Shirt runs small strings are a weird elastic material
1.0,This was stated to fit a child 8 to 10 years old. I opened it up and the top although it was labeled extra large would not fit my child. I read the sizes run small so I thought if I ordered this extra large it would fit a 6 year old child but it did not. I ended up giving it to a friend's child who is 3 years old.
1.0,"A la primera vez, que las usé se dadañaron"
1.0,Sadly this dress came much shorter than it was advertised. So it did not meet my expectations at all. But it does have a very cute fit to it and I wish it was as shown.
1.0,"The material is itchy, fit is horrendous.. better quality at the 99 cent store!!<br />The material is ugly, the fit is weird, it is sewn askew, so it bunches."
1.0,Beautiful beanie but unfortunately too small
1.0,The lettering was hard to read it was in white lettering instead of black
1.0,dont stay up
1.0,Turned out to be very cheap in hand.
1.0,"In less than 2.5 months, 2 links broke from just wearing it.  Disappointed,  considering the price. It was a gift for the hubby for our anniversary.  We thought that 10 k was stronger!!!"
1.0,Poor quality and uncomfortable.
1.0,My husband wears a large because of the reviews I bought a 2xl he received it today and started laughing. It literally fits my 7 year old daughter would not even go on my husbands arms.  Very disappointed
1.0,I am beyond happy and satisfied with this product! It is true to picture. I am super excited and can’t wait to see the person receiving its face.
1.0,The tie dye one is gross.  It's not a sweatshirt AT ALL!  The fabric is shiny and feels like plastic.  Like old lady pants from the dollar store.  Went directly to the donate pile.  Another review said Halloween costume.  That's an excellent way to describe the fabric.  Total rip off.  No tags.
1.0,for a child.
1.0,Terrible quality very cheap and ugly . Even too ugly for a casual maternity dress. I also could not return it.
1.0,hate this product.  not cotton at all.
1.0,Sizing chart is way off!!!  Way too small.  I ordered an XL and it was more like an extra small.  Seller is difficult to work with in returning the item and getting a refund!  Do not order from this storefront.
1.0,"I regret buying this blazer and am seriously giving up buying clothes altogether from Amazon. It’s so low quality, a horrible synthetic material, does not fit well or comfortably, fabric is kind of rough, looks terribly cheap."
1.0,The slide right off your head shortly after putting them on. I wouldn't purchase unless you plan on using double sided tape to keep them in place.
1.0,"If you are a woman then this jacket is for you. I got a XXL (I usually wear XL)  this jacket is a little tight but I can live with it. The zipper is in the wrong place which makes me think I got a woman's jacket and  woman sizes (small, med. large, etc....)  run smaller.  I really thought I was getting a good deal  :-("
1.0,"If you truely want something that fits you well, go to stores in person and try it out.<br />This is my last time buying clothes from Amazon. They dont match the pictures."
1.0,I really like the earrings but I got very upset when I had open the box it was on 1 earrings and it wasn’t in the little bag it was in the box by it self I haven’t even opened the little bag where the earrings supposed to come
1.0,"Fit was awful. Very tight elastic in the waist and the cuffs on the knee area fit like it was made for a toddler. Very poor workmanship. I ended up throwing them out. DO NOT PURCHASE, you will be extremely disappointed."
1.0,"1 week of use not overloaded, sad to say a seam failed causing this bag to be useless. Didn’t even get the chance to put it to any kind of test.... :("
1.0,It fell apart in one week
1.0,"I bought this because of the other reviews. It looked nice. But it is so cheap. It looks poorly homemade at best. There are no tags. The fabric pattern isn't correct. The style isn't even the same--it looks like a gunny sack. There is no internal bra. It isn't in any way the product shown. Very, very disappointed. I'm sure amazon will work with me on this, but I doubt I'll get anything from the seller. Beware of this product!!"
1.0,Watch band broke after 2 weeks
1.0,I normally wear a 3X I ordered 3X and 2X and as I walked they would slide down so I returned them.<br />I liked they had a pocket on the side.<br />But hate they didn’t work for me.
1.0,Broke within a week - cheap and not high quality<br />do not buy
1.0,Fit was too small.
1.0,"These were so much smaller than shown. Im fairly short in the legs, but these went from just above my ankle to just below my knee. And not just lengthwise - i dont have much to my calf,  but i do have some muscle, and i couldnt get the leg warmer over my calf. It actually started unravelling the first time i put it on! In my opinion these are child size and should be marketed as such. Not at all worth the price."
1.0,"Bought the dino print. So cute, fit as expected. Not as soft as I’d hoped but my kid didn’t mind. He’s only worn them for one day and already there are two holes. Not on the seams either. The fabric easily tears. My kid has never torn a pair of pants ... ever. I wish they were better quality."
1.0,"Although it was meant to be worn loosely, I found that it was almost too loose. Extremely baggy and off putting. It was also extremely long but I am also only 5'2""."
1.0,Button fell off the top with in two weeks. very unfortunate for the price
1.0,Nothing to these sandals. They look and feel cheap. The strap that goes across the top of the foot looks like a piece of piping the way it’s seen. I won’t wear them. Probably just donate them to church shoes drive. Too much trouble to return them.
1.0,Not true to size. Had to return.  It was really cute though.
1.0,Do NOT under ANY circumstance purchase these earrings!! They are not even worth $10.00! I was intending on giving these to my daughter in law. Now I will give them to my granddaughter.....she is only 5 years old!! They are extremely small!! Do NOT  WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0,This strap was to big for my wrist not enough holes for a small wrist sent it back.
1.0,I bought this beautiful necklace for my mom as a Christmas gift. She wore it out to dinner the next night and the whole center setting fell out! Very unhappy about this.
1.0,"These socks are only fit for a child in my humble opinion.  Not “men’s” as described.  As new, they were no where near long enough to fit in my foot.  I cannot imagine how much smaller they will be once washed!  Glad I bought on Prime so I could return.  Most of time I would “eat” the cost, but I almost feel cheated.  I am glad Amazon Prime is here and guarantees their items.  I wish these had been larger because the design is nicely “male”."
1.0,"They broke in a day, returned them"
1.0,There was no.instructions on.how to.lace them.they were a gift and I waS very disapointed can't even.use them.
1.0,"Too sheer, sized small"
1.0,not really meant for someone under 5ft 5
1.0,This is awful so cheap and completely gauze see through don't waste your money.
1.0,"It is not really comfy, maybe after I wash it? I was not expecting it to be to my ankles. Maybe a thigh version would look more attractive but it makes short me look like a balloon."
1.0,Wore bracelet a half dozen times and silver wearing off. Not worth $19.99.
1.0,Everyone one of these came to me SPLIT down the middle.<br />Not much use as an apron when it’s 2 pieces<br />Would not purchase here again
1.0,"Got it Father's Day, wood on band broke (not the pin popping out, wood connecting band to to the base actually broke off) in less than 1/2 a year.. Wore only a few times to work. Manufacturer only guarantees item for 30 days"
1.0,"My beanie came in and it was not a Polo brand beanie, but a cheap generic one with no logo."
1.0,"the shirt is UNDER SIZED! & OFF COLORED, order black and yellow shirt is very much dark blue, ruined my whole outfit 🙄😭"
1.0,"These do not stay on the fitbit for longer than 1 hour. After they fall off, they will not stay on long enough to even put the fitbit back on wrist. One time use on each one."
1.0,"In the description, it says 54mm but, I got 47.55 mm. poor quality, paint are peeling off. never recommend for daily use glasses."
1.0,"I disliked this product. The flannel was very thick and stiff, and the design extremely boxy. The color (aqua) was very displeasing to the eye, and the stipes much thicker than pictured. I ordered this short sleeved product pictured-- I now see the description mentions both short sleeve and long sleeve, which makes no sense at all. At any rate, I received long-sleeved PJs. Also, the waistband is thick, ill-made, unattractive and uncomfortable. Even as pajamas, I found these unwearable. The product took a long time to arrive too."
1.0,When it got to me the 'ring' was a flat pole and I was going to give it to my friend as a ring however that was not what I received.
1.0,I received a pair as a gift but were in the shape of hummingbird.  One broke to pieces the first time I wore it.
1.0,Im disappointed because I got the wrong item.
1.0,Material for shirt is soo thin it’s see through- not an exaggeration!!
1.0,tiny... I'm an XL and it dose not fit at all.. I will have to gift it..
1.0,"The fabric was not true cotton. The fabric was more like 100 thread count, felt cheap and was clingy, which made it lay weirdly. The top half was too loose and big around my C cups. Not a flattering fit on me at all. I purchased a large and normally wear a L/12  and am 5'7"""
1.0,"Horrible made and  cheap product. The paxkage was nicer tgan the product, and ine of the clasps was broken.  Think its a plastic not leather also.  Would have been better to just use an old shoe string."
1.0,"I got my standard size in dresses like these and this didn't fit at all like stated. The fabric didn't have any give to it and it was not flattering on.<br /><br />Thinking it was a ""me"" problem, I had my mother who is smaller than I am both height, weight, and chest wise try this on and it was too small for her. And she's 4 cup sizes smaller than I am. It was too tight around the waist and arms.<br /><br />I ended up returning this.<br /><br />One Star"
1.0,This is a beautiful tire but it is not REAL silk!
1.0,Shoe was too small the straps were right returned the shoes.
1.0,Ripped when trying to put them on.  I've been wearing other brands for several years.  No issues...not very durable.
1.0,I have ordered this product twice. The first time it was a small & I couldn’t even get it past my ankle literally! The second time I ordered a medium & couldn’t get it past my calf! I am 5’2 I wear a size 5 in pants which is a small! The sizes are completely inaccurate! There is absolutely no stretch at all! I really wanted this outfit for my birthday so I’m debating on rather I should try the large but as of now I am not happy at all with all the purchasing & returns I’ve had to do! On top of that the bigger the size the more it cost!
1.0,"Though the color and style were great, the missing loops and very thin material made for a cheaply made swimsuit. Also, if you're top heavy, there is no support since the material is too thin."
1.0,I did not receive the watch bands in my delivery!
1.0,Material is stiff and has no flow. This makes the bottom of the dress look like a tent.
1.0,This hat was crushed when I received it!  I was very unsatisified with it.  The band didn't seem like it fit the hat.  The only compliment I can give is the color.
1.0,"I wish the skirt came as pictured.. The one I received was a dull matte light blue one completely, different from this photo."
1.0,I bought 2 of them and didn't even have it on an hour each time and they broke wouldn't buy it again gave them a second chance and didn't report it but cheaply made and didn't last an hour and broke
1.0,"One of the glasses was broken when I got them, I want it replaced but can't seem to get it replaced"
1.0,Bought this dress because in the description it was made out of cotton. Not the case at all. Material feels plastic-y almost. Definitely not breathable. The colors are also a little more clownlike in person than in the pic. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Got these for an early Christmas gift, they’re very comfortable but ugly as hell!! I’d be caught dead in these!! Clown shoes!! They look just like clown shoes they make your feet look wider than they are too🤣 never buy these as a gift for someone..."
1.0,It's barely big enough for my iPhone 7plus. You cannot close it if you have a case of any kind on the phone.
1.0,"I am 5'1, 150 lbs, size 32DD and I bought a Large. This dress was awkward. It was HUGE everywhere except the chest and shoulders, it was tight and small there. It was shapeless. Felt like I was wearing an 8th grade Home Ec project gone wrong. The fabric felt like cheap polyester, it clung to my bedspread and really, any other fabric it came across. It looked smooth, but it felt itchy."
1.0,"I ordered 3 styles of Telic sadals (1 in a size 8, 2 in a size 9) as well as a pair of OOFOS Unisex flip-flop sandals recently.<br /><br />I have nothing I can say positive about the Telic sandals after receiving them.<br /><br />I ordered one and two sizes up, based on reviews, I am comfortable saying these run much smaller than the Telic website size charts for each style suggests. I wear a 7.5 W or a 38 European, and with the suggestions of ordering up in mind I got the two sizes.<br /><br />The Mallory, this particular shoe, didn't even get tried on. It was obvious before opening the package something was wrong with one strap. It was a clear break/tear of the strap across the top where they &quot;cross&quot; each other. The material of the shoe felt rigid and reminded me of the cheap sandals/clogs you can get at Dollar General and similar places.<br /><br />Save your time, try another brand. All 3 Telics are being returned, and I'll keep the OOFOS and continue looking.<br /><br />The only upside to these sandals is the ease that buying from Amazon makes returns."
1.0,Very poor quality. It was to be a gift. No way. Very cheap.
1.0,"I thought this would be great to hold my glasses around my neck but it didn’t work out that way. It’s pretty but the chain is not secure. My glasses have fallen off the chain several times. No way to tighten the hold. Second, the chain gets tangled in my hair and hurts to detangle. I finally had to give up on it."
1.0,"Not what I expected.  Product has absolutely no type of arch support which is what I was most concerned about when using these for winter walking.  I sent them back, almost, immediately."
1.0,Not worth it!  Super cute ring but very very weak  fragile design.  The first one I got was bent and about to crack in half when I opened it.  I returned that one and the second one is in good shape but it feels just as weak as the first one. It won’t last long which is very unfortunate.  Waste of money.
1.0,Item runs about 1-2 sizes smaller
1.0,"I've been wearing it for a a few hours and it already has a hole in it (where the seam meets the rest of the fabric. I knew it wasn't going to be high quality at this price, but that's just ridiculous."
1.0,The stones looked so fake and cheap
1.0,Bottoms are tight enough to stay on your calve. Thin cheap material and not flattering.
1.0,cheaply  made but for the price cant expect much
1.0,The size was off.  It feels almost two sizes too small.
1.0,Looks bigger and more colorful in the picture.  I was disappointed
1.0,"I wanted to like this. It's not that it doesn't look like the photo as much as it is just grossly oversized and cheaply made. The color was nice, but the craftsmanship was poor, the shoulders sloppy, and the stitching lazy. I tried to make myself like it because the color and concept were appealing, but the fabric was like the type you would find in an old ladies nightgown in the 1980's Sears bargain basement. It just screamed POLYESTER. Good from afar but far from good."
1.0,"very pretty, but u get what u pay for. after 1 day wear one of the snaps will not connect with the post"
1.0,This product is Disney brand (allegedly) so I'm especially disappointed. The pants ripped 5 minutes after my step son put them on. If I could give them 0 stars I would. A paper bag holds up better than these.. I cannot believe how much money I spent on absolute junk!!!
1.0,"Wanted a refund.  Sent me another.  Returning it to another place.  Not Khol’s, UPS store."
1.0,"These a rather pointless. They are so slick, but they just slide right off my head."
1.0,Too gaudy and heavy.  I did not realize it was so long (my bad).
1.0,Extremely poor quality...even given the cheaper price. Not worth it at all.
1.0,The socks ripped after one washing. How can I get the replaced?
1.0,Cheap synthetic feeling
1.0,Fell off. Cheap magnet clasp
1.0,These were supposed to be strong and durable. Every single one rips when I put them on. Very disappointed.
1.0,They may be advertised for women but clearly for young girl
1.0,I won't order this because the quote on the back is misspelled.
1.0,Too small. Took forever to get here since it came from out of the country. Returning would take too long. The XL fit my sister who wears a medium.
1.0,Was not a flattering fit for my body (5'10&#34; ~160lb). Smelled very strongly like vinegar when I opened the package.
1.0,Changes colour. Wasted my money
1.0,"Very thin, polyester dress. Looks cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Cute design, bad execution. Returning dress."
1.0,"Really unhappy with this shirt. The actual product does not look like the photo.  The shirt is very thin, not fitted, short in length and is a random generic brand.  More of an adult ladies cut than a teen girls cut which is usually narrow cut and longer for layering.  The image on the shirt is also super dim / faded, not vibrant like the photo.  I contacted the seller to discuss a return and received no response.  Really disappointed considering how expensive the shirt was.  Recommend buying the shirt through Hot Topic instead."
1.0,"Very oddly shaped slippers and definitely ran large.  I am true to fit with a 7-8M with all other slippers, but these were way too large to wear comfortably with my size 7 foot.  Not happy with the look or the fit."
1.0,Bought this for a theme party . This material was clinging and the lint was all over.Poor quality<br />Returned
1.0,"The magnets are not strong enough to hold through the skin of your inner nose. At least for me they wouldn’t. And it’s not like I have a thick septum either, the magnets are just super weak. Sucks because I liked all the colors but they’re useless now"
1.0,Dont like them at all. Material is not the same as the add on line.
1.0,"Extremely small, took a very long time to receive"
1.0,It faded very fast and comes apart
1.0,I like they are nice size. I do not like they won't stay on while putting bra on no fasteners just a slit and time you put bra on they fall off not pleased at all
1.0,"I got a size large for my 6’ tall husband. It fit perfectly in the torso, but the sleeves barely went past his elbows. I tried it on, to see if it would fit me. I am 5’7” and wear a women’s medium and the sleeves were a good 3” too short on me. Which is completely bonkers. Unless you are T-Rex, with the 6appropriately tiny arms, I’d avoid this hoodie."
1.0,"Very dissatisfied with this. It felt cheap to the touch, the arms were uneven which made it sit lopsided on my face, and it's way too small to do its job. Returned the same day I received it. The pictures and description definitely do not fit reality."
1.0,"Ordered the SILVER jacket, recieved the RED one. Package even has the SILVER label on it. Had to order another jacket from a different company in order to have my outfit to wear to a masquerade party."
1.0,wowwww
1.0,Way too small. Sent it back.
1.0,"The fabric was so cheap and see-through. I had to wear a slip under it, but the fabric slid all over the place with it so I constantly had to re-adjust...I say ""had"" in the past tense because I ended up donating it the last time I did a closet clean-out. You will never relax when you have it on because it needs to be adjusted constantly. I thought I was getting a beautiful embroidered dress and not even close - the ""embroidery"" is just printed onto cheap, terrible fabric."
1.0,"Fit great, but had tint holes in the front that cannot be repaired... unfortunately, only discovered these holes while I was wearing on vacation and didn't have another clean outfit : ("
1.0,"Keep in mind, this shirt has ZERO stretch. If you have any boobs or curves go 2 sizes bigger than you usually would with a shirt. I wear a large in Target and every other t-shirt I own but I couldn't get this size large on at all"
1.0,"Wow, for a Small, this is literally anything but. It is insanely baggy – it hugs virtually no part of my body at all, and it goes all the way down to just above my knees like a dress. What the heck were they thinking when they made this? Like what body type is supposed to look good in somethings so poorly fitted? DO NOT BUY if you value tapered fitting clothing"
1.0,"I have had this for less than 7 or 8 months that I have had countless times where the Fitbit would pop out of the band. Thank God I have been able to locate it each time but I am afraid of that one time that it pops out and I don't know it and loose my devise for good. I am also not happy with the bit of the strap that holds the band after clasping it. When I put on the band I have to always pull that little thing further in and it ripped off one of the cross bars, when the other one breaks I will have nothing to hold down the extra flap of band."
1.0,This dress is so thin you can see every body part you have. Very cheaply made!!!!
1.0,"Totally a piece of garbage, please don't waste your money"
1.0,Description doesn't say it's for kids
1.0,This is too small  to use on anything and would return if I could. Also took a very long time to arrive.
1.0,"I'm 5'6 and normally weigh 185. I'm a size 16 women's; I have hips and booty. When I say these were small, they got to my knees and stopped."
1.0,I am returning this product as 2 adults could not figure out how to program it! Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,"Terrible! It has NO lining, meaning that the holes in the lace pattern go straight to your skin. The dimensions are also so off! Weird length. I’m 5’ 2” 120lbs and it was not a good fit."
1.0,There was no jewelry in my package and it was opened.
1.0,Soy L y lo pedi XL por precaución y me qued pequeño.
1.0,The socks were way too small and too tight.  I was very disappointed because there was no way I could put them on or wear them.
1.0,Too big for a charm bracelet but a nice design.
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.  ITS NOTHING LIKE IS APPEARS.  VERY CHEAP. AND THE SELLER IS RUDE.
1.0,"One of the straps broke after wearing these a few times. It broke off at the point where the plastic is stitched together, and seems to be a flaw in the design (The stitching essentially perforates the plastic, creating a line of easily torn material)."
1.0,It took almost a month to come in and the material is cheap. The shorts are so small they couldn't fit over my thighs and you can see right through the fabric. I saw a video on tik tok of this set and it looked so nice so I was really excited. When it came in I was really disappointed.
1.0,"It came broken, couldn't return it, don't waste your time, it's a pretty paper weight now."
1.0,"Return, very cheap and non functional"
1.0,The picture makes it look white… that section of the tie is def a metallic silver.
1.0,Nothing like pictured!!! They were returned or donated I honestly don’t remember!!!
1.0,The wand broke while we tried to remove it from the packaging. You need to be a surgeon to remove this delicate toy.
1.0,Horrible shoes! As soon as I touched them the dye started to stain my fingers blue. If you get any water on these shoes all the dye runs out. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"Extremely poor quality, ring broke it 2 pieces after only 5 days of wearing it."
1.0,"Do not buy from this seller. I ordered halloween masks at the beginning of September last year. When they hadn’t arrived by mid-late October, I contacted the seller to cancel my order.  It stayed as ‘pending’ forever. Imagine my surprise when I was looking for another order tonight to see that I had finally been CHARGED for the masks that never came. After I had specifically said I didn’t want them any more!!"
1.0,Really do like these and my little girl has the pink set in. Disappointed due to the fact that I only had one red earring and 3 diamond earrings.
1.0,The print is so cute but the waist is so high that it fits like a maternity dress.  Not the look I was going for :(
1.0,The crotch of the pants are wayyyyy too big and the overall leg of the pants are too wide!!! Sizing is very off
1.0,Bought this when it was on sale. You get what you pay for. The band is horribly cheap. The face is cute but just...just dont. I wouldn't even gift this to someone.
1.0,"Poor quality,  zipper kept getting stuck,  fabric was very thin and didn't fit right on top."
1.0,"So apparently all these sweats have become ""skinny"" sweats...not a fan, sorry<br />The image is deceiving...they appear to be normal fit but they are definitely NOT"
1.0,This item was not what I thought. It does not open/ snap near your privates you feel like you are completely undressing if you need to go to the bathroom. The design of the neck line is very revealing I thought I could just button it all the way but it is not designed for that. The sleeves are long the material is nice. The material is thick so when placing jeans/pants over this item you will have panty lines.Just because of the design it makes this very uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,I was so disappointed but for the price I let it slide.
1.0,The main thing I don't like about it is the texture of the fabric its super rough and itchy.
1.0,cheap. cheap. cheap
1.0,Cheap and flimsy not worth the money.
1.0,"I thought it was cool looking but it was annoying in my ear, hurt and broke too quickly. Never again"
1.0,It was far too wide
1.0,The color looked nothing like the picture. The lenses were blue when they came when they are clearly orange in the picture. Frame was a completely different orange as well. So the picture looked nothing like the actual product.
1.0,Recieved the t shirts but came in small. Listing stated XL which is what I needed for a gift. Sending it back!!! So dissatisfied & disappointed!
1.0,WAYYYY too small!!! I wanted to love this shirt. Even ordered the 2xl. still fits like a child M because the torso is short.
1.0,"I ordered this bag January 5th 2019 for my son and received it not long after.  The bag and the design seemed fantastic.  But on March 8th 2019 all three buckles that hold the shoulder strap broke at once while he was in school.  And it didn't just break off, they broken into many pieces.  The buckles holding the strap was clearly made of cheap plastic.  Also, my son wasn't even carrying text books or anything too heavy, he had folders and composition books.  I will try to fix the strap so my son can continue using the bag, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this."
1.0,"My first pair lasted 2 years, the second less than 2 months.<br />Update: the inner (bobbin) thread ran out during the production of the shoe."
1.0,Quality of material is horrible
1.0,Wasn't happy with the quality of the sweater.
1.0,Small dead bugs looked like fleas threw it in the trash
1.0,"The same day i wore them is the same day i lost one of them, really cheap backing for that to happen its a damn shame. beware dont buy"
1.0,"While the fit is good, the legs start rolling up as soon as they are put on.<br />The underwear fits as expected, is snug, and soft. The fit is good overall, but soon after putting them on they start the rolling up the leg. The fact that they roll up makes them uncomfortable to wear."
1.0,"Ripped the second I put them on and they’re not even too tight, they’re too big. So why would they rip? Don’t buy these. They feel comfortable but they’re crap."
1.0,"Listed as XXL but fits like Small.  Extremely narrow and tight, virtually no stretch. Poor quality, poor attempt to copy similar-looking socks from hospitals and rehab centers."
1.0,It don't look nothing like the picture. I was very disappointed
1.0,the picture made it look like a big fluffy sweatshirt when in reality it is a polyester nylon kind of material
1.0,"It 's baffling that anyone gave these socks more than 2 stars, the quality is really really bad bad!<br />The  fabric is very thin, I just wear this socks no more  than 2 times, then it's already had HOLES!<br />I don't recommend anyone buy this socks."
1.0,"It was a good thought to have a 'backpack' to tuck and pull out. It is very small and extra threads and such are all over. I was expecting something a little more durable. It is super lightweight so if that is what you are looking for it would be great to for hiking, taking to the farmer's market, etc. Not an everyday backpack."
1.0,"Very thin material, cheaply made."
1.0,Broke in a day
1.0,Broke within a month and a half... Amazon need to stop letting people send us garbage. We work hard for our money. I risk my life for mine.🤔😡. My grandbaby yrs old was devastated
1.0,"Don't buy, this mullet hair style is awful!!!! I went to lovers lane and bought a wig for Elsa."
1.0,"D dress was to small to be a large.do not waste your money, because you only get half back."
1.0,"I've had this watch for some time and I feel like now is the time to do a review. Great looking band aesthetically. However, the clasp that buckles the band underneath continues to come apart on its own. Very weak locking mechanism. If your hand move suddenly or something as simple as clapping, your bracelet will come undone. I cannot recommend this item."
1.0,The cute little fold over was actually more like a skirt on top. The fit of the pants can only be described as wonky. I tried to return them and the company would have made me pay for the return postage which was $13usd. I paid less than that for the pants. So I ended up just throwing them away.
1.0,Isnide zipper broke within 2 minutes of having it.  Not worth the money.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:a816b1e51b8bd7d2d71b6aa97600c4dc]] Me llegó un monedero de mujer. No es según la descripción. No fue lo que pedí. Lo peor es que mañana es el cumple de mi papá y ese era su regalo. Ahora no tengo que regalarle 😭😭😭😭
1.0,Cartilage got infected
1.0,Dress runs way smaller than normal sizes.
1.0,"Bracelets do not rate in comparison to photos and descriptions shown. Ornaments were much smaller than expected, therefore the font is extremely small. Dissatisfied is an understatement."
1.0,"The sizing is way off. I bought the 3xl, I normally wear a 2xl, but I sized up in case of this situation. The 3xl barely came above my knees. The material is very cheap almost sheer. It didn't even come with the belt. I set extremely low expectations for this item and still expected too much."
1.0,This didn't even come close to the proper size
1.0,This dress runs large and is made for very short waisted people. I bought for my Mom and it did not fit but missed the window to return.
1.0,"First, the material is terrible.  It is stretchy, but not the soft, silky material I expected. It looks very cheap and holds wrinkles (never good).<br />Second, the picture shows a fairly high neckline, but it is just a normal round, scoop neck. Very unflattering...<br /><br />There is absolutely no shape whatsoever; From armpit to hem, it looks like a shapeless sack. I can't imagine this looking good on anyone not perfectly posed. I ordered a medium, but it is HUGE!  I could fit 3 of me in there!  (I am 5'6&#34;, medium build).<br /><br />...It has to go back!"
1.0,Wore it 1 time..washed my hands..watch had water in it..first time under water..was supposed to be waterproof..total junk..
1.0,Does NOT look like the pictures AT ALL!!! So disappointed ☹️
1.0,"You get what you pay for! The only metal on the watch is the back of the watch, everything else is cheap and plastic!"
1.0,This is for my 2.5 yr old grandson who likes to help in the kitchen. It’s perfect for him.
1.0,order two sizes up
1.0,"I disliked the fact that the green stone had come off. It was a gift for,my husband. I had to glue it back on. Won't order from,this company again."
1.0,"I think that these are poor quality and if you are looking for earrings for a child, do not get these. They bend easily."
1.0,I was not happy that I ordered a XXL and it fits like an XL. It is not cotton like the others on the market. It is not the faded yellow like the real PEE CHEE folders. It is Super Bright.
1.0,I did not like this necklace at all and will never wear it. Although it photographed well it looks very cheap which in fact it was! I did consider the price unrealistic and I have never bought a piece I like this cheaply. I would not recommend it to anyone else and I will follow my head in the future.
1.0,"Looks cheap, not nice. Sending back to much trouble, so I gave it to a girl."
1.0,"Ordered a size up and it was still too small, didn't heat properly,  not worth paying money for.  I  Ordered an xl mens for a woman that wears a m-l couldn't even zip it up. Would not buy again"
1.0,Terrible item. Not only did it break on the first try on the lighting broke as well
1.0,Way to small. Size up a few sizes
1.0,Super sad very disappointed super cute shoe but it's like the smallest shoe I've ever seen there's no way it's like a size off :(
1.0,Please don't buy these pins for trade at Disney parks. They are fake.  The colors are off and the quality is rough.  Disney should crack down on these because it degrades pin trading.  Who wants to trade their good stuff for junk? They sell great starter sets at Disney.  It's not this cheap but you get what you pay for.  We can obviously tell the lanyards that are full of this junk.
1.0,"It was supposed to be a woman’s plus size 1-3 x made in China , never buy China couldn’t get it past my knees !!!!!!"
1.0,First pair I ordered came and one of the clasps did not stay and kept falling off. I sent them back and reorder product. Second pair I have to work to get the clasp to line up correctly to get it to close. They are very beautiful but poor quality on the clasps.
1.0,"Small , fragile"
1.0,"Ordered size 6, ring came in bag that said size 6, but was actually a size 5"
1.0,Sizing charts were way off. It did not fit or look anything the photos.
1.0,"This cute hi/low BAIDEJIABEI women's tunic top is a nightmare! The arms are so skinny tight you can't move them and then the rest of the blouse is large and flowy. It would only work on a large woman with skinny arms. I should of read the review before ordering. Plus the fall colored fabric is very transparent so one can see through it. The only logical way to save this garment is to give it to a slim young woman who is pregnant. Most plus size women also have larger arms too. This manufacturer needs to get or make patterns that are based on European size women not petite tiny women. If you want to sell to the American public, then you need to have your patterns fit the majority of American women figure sizes. This would definitely be a return for me. I will donate it as totally useless for me."
1.0,this came with 2 of the same thing
1.0,I thought it was adorable and for a great price as well. Unfortunately the saying you get what you paid for applied with my order. I didn't have the side loop for the cross-body strap. Had to send it back for a refund and went another route.
1.0,Tarnished badly. Top is pretty. I'm not even sure if you would call it tarnish  (sliver came off )
1.0,To large & to frumpy no good.
1.0,Shirt too small. Shorts fit fine.
1.0,This hat is poorly made.  You can see where the bow is glued to the hat.  It had glue strings on it.  Looks like it was made by a second grader.  Sending it back.
1.0,Poor quality. Smelled strange.  Too large. And forget sending it back....they provide a label to send it back to China on your dime.
1.0,"I couldn't walk thirty yards from my apt. without these socks ending up around the balls of my feet, stuck in my boots. Tried with different shoes. No good."
1.0,"This was bought for my 3 year old granddaughter’s jacket. It was so tiny I could barely see what it looked like. Also in order to return it, I was going to be charged $3.33. The zipper pull only cost $5.99. Ridiculous, it would fit in an small envelope with plenty of room left over. I didn’t want to give out any stars but couldn’t submit this review without doing so."
1.0,"WAY too large! Way way way too large! Ordered a size large, a small would have been fine. Sent it right back for a refund."
1.0,"It looked nice, silicone is good, color was good but quality isn't there. The clasp gave out after wearing the band for a week. I stuck hand in pocket to put keys in and pulled hand out then<br />magnet came unglued on clasp and my Galaxy watch pro 5 fell off my wrist and hit the concrete, sad."
1.0,.. Wore Them at bellow 50 and I was still cold.. imaging &#34;bellow 35&#34;!!
1.0,"It was much smaller, than I expected & the metal looked thin & cheap!  I know it was only $40, but will not buy from this vendor again.  The pictures on the site looked much nicer than the actual earrings."
1.0,Yuck
1.0,Returned. Not for me. Didn’t like the look on my body!
1.0,Not sure what XL size was based on
1.0,"I bought these earrings style in 2 sizes.  They are soooo cheap, not even Forever21 quality.  The bottom is not smooth and the gold tone is very light gold tone.  They also hang funny on the ear, almost sticks out to the side.  Not for me."
1.0,Its rip after only a couple  of days of use
1.0,This wallet was horrible I bought for my husband as a gift. The very first time he used the wallet it ripped. It is very cheap.
1.0,This dress looks very sexy on the model but when I tried it on - while it did fit - it felt like I was wearing a bath robe.  Didn't look at all sexy.  I returned it.  I wear 12-14 and ordered a large and it fit but was not at all flattering.
1.0,"Materials are thin. Also, These are made for tall folks only. I’m 4’11; I wore this and it went all the way down just right above my ankles, not my knees as pictured. A bit disappointed."
1.0,Shed to much to wear. Fuzz everywhere smh
1.0,"Cheap, shiny material that clings and shows every single flaw. If you want to show off back-fat you never knew you had, buy this top!"
1.0,"There's been a trend where Asian vanity sizing is creeping into US products (i.e. sized small and proportioned for someone with no muscles).  But this is worse than anything I've ever tried on.  These are proportioned for a 16 year old boy mid-growth spurt (so that gangly starved look).  The hips are completely straight.  The butt is completely flat.  The legs are tapered and hang off the ends of my heels.<br /><br />This isn't even &#34;skinny&#34; proportions and sizing.  This product takes everything wrong with Asian sizing, and makes even more *EXTREME*!1!!!!1111!1.  /eyeroll<br /><br />Flat measurements for size 16: Waist 17&#34;, hip 18.5&#34;, thigh 11&#34;, calf 8.5&#34;.  Waist sits about 4&#34; below my belly button.  There is no stretch.  They feel cheap and thin.<br /><br />All these 5 star reviews are extremely suspect.  Something is not right, here.<br /><br />Just stay away.  Unless you're a 16 year old boy.  Then they'd be great."
1.0,"The image on it was low quality, the material was awful. Not worth $30. Hot topic has WAY better ones for the same price."
1.0,"This product was not what I had in mind. The band is not long enough so it sits funny. The ear warmers are large enough, but they do not conform or cover the ears. They just sit on top of the ears. May work better for children or smaller adults."
1.0,It was broke when I recieved it in the package.<br />Very disappointed as it was a gift :(
1.0,I have a round face and this could fit 3 people in it terrible.<br />Right back it goes!
1.0,"Me la puse 1 sola vez y estaba roya, ni siquiera alcance a lavarla."
1.0,"I purchased these after a recommendation from an OB in the hospital after my c-section. I could not wear them right away as you are not supposed to wear them while the incision is still healing. After a few weeks I tried them on and they just don't fit well at all. For reference - I am 5'1 and was 150lbs when I delivered, down to about 125lbs by the time I tried these on - I purchased size sm-med. They come up to my bra, no joke. And then just roll down because it's right above my natural waist which is smaller than where the top of the panties hit. They are not usable for me - and of course, since it's been over 30 days, I'm unable to return them. Major bummer since they are so expensive. Honestly, I think they are a bad purchase due to the short return window (who knows when you will be able to use them since they are for post-surgery...) I regret buying them. Also - in order to take advantage of the silicone strip, you would have to buy a bunch of pairs - which I'm sure the seller/amazon would love - or you have to wash them all the time."
1.0,Very cheap looking and the wrong color gold
1.0,"You will only get one pair! Buyer beware!!! It doesn’t come in a 3 pack at all!!! What a pain. I’ve gotten replacement leggings -  single packs every time, I am over it."
1.0,This is not a sweat shirt but a hooded shirt with a zipper.  I ordered 2 and after washing them the one I bought my older son fit the 2yr old and the smaller one was useless. Even at the low price it was a major disappointment.
1.0,"Weeks later I am still waiting for the seller so I can return it.<br />I am a 5' 4&#34; & Size 8-10  shirt ( medium ) Bra size 36 D. Jean size 6-8.<br /> I ordered a Large because the description said &#34;Runs small&#34; I like my shirts fitted, but this was not just small, it is way too small.<br />My son is  5' 6&#34;  Size small men's shirt. Jean size 30W 32L. We were curious to see how it fit him too.<br />Still too tight and too short.<br />It fit my tween perfect. She's 5'  & weighs 90lbs, is a medium shirt size in Youth sizes, with no bra size."
1.0,"Cute. BUT...I normally wear a small or medium (in juniors), for reference I'm 5'6, 132 and 34d. I ordered the 4XL, which is supposed to be equivalent to a 1XL, it's still about a medium. The sleeves are short, they do not hit my wrists and the shoulders feel tight. To boot, it's not long at all, it hits me about mid-hip, so it wouldn't even cover my bum.<br /><br />This probably would work for a petite woman, or a really small juniors size. I'm really shocked at how many are raving about it. It's made nice but nothing fabulous, would...if it fit, be worth about this price but ill fitting clothing is not my style. Returing."
1.0,"Should advertise for children, not adults."
1.0,"The heart  broke immediately upon opening. It is made of two hearts snapped together. One fell off and I couldn't snap it back together. Also, the design looks childish, but it was way to big for my six-year-old's wrist. Fortunately it was cheap enough that I didn't mind throwing it away."
1.0,Pants are super small and VERY poorly made. Uneven stitching on everything. Do not buy. These are terrible.
1.0,Shoes fell apart before I even wore them.
1.0,"It looks like it's made for a child, It stretches around me but it's too tight. According to the measurements it should have fit like a MD/LG belt in juniors, It fits like a XS/S. It was a total waste of money & it looks cheap. I would like my money back."
1.0,"I went back to buy again, thinking that the first one was damaged but it turned out the same"
1.0,I know it wasn't expensive you get what you pay for. Waited 2 months zipper doesn't close and didn't see printing when I ordered. Not something I will use.
1.0,I ordered this item 2 sizes larger to ensure it would fit.  It is ridiculously small and the material is very cheap.  Do not waste your money on this product.
1.0,Super thin!
1.0,I wear extra large but these extra large are very small in size this is not the accurate size
1.0,"Unfortunately the band breaks easily if not using the center holes. I ended up using a hole that was closer to the edge of the band and did not notice, so throughout the day the silicone started to rip and once I noticed the wrong placement I switched it to the middle hole and by that point the bands integrity was compromised and the band is now in two. I definitely will not get this type of band again. Iommi"
1.0,Not happy with this product.Doesn't look at all like what was in the photo.Didn't like material.
1.0,"If you order, please size up as it runs small. Shirt came with no wash instructions and when washed on gentle cycle the stitching came out. I only got to wear this once. Poorly made."
1.0,The photo makes it look like this beautiful rich yarn scarf in truth is a thin piece of felt with a print on it. I returned it
1.0,This fits very weird not really good for short thicker girls to tight in the chest area frumpy in all the other areas will be giving away
1.0,"Letters were same color as cap, not as advertised"
1.0,This is NOT a Star of David. This is a satanic symbol
1.0,Waist was way too big.
1.0,"Flag glasses not as pictured. What arrived was a pair of red, white, and blue camouflage glasses and a pair of green, brown, and orange camouflage glasses.  Quality is also appalling, you can see the screen print camouflage while wearing."
1.0,"The dress is lovely. The design and cut are cool, but the bottom tab part is completely, 100% see through. Even flesh colored underwear are visible through it..<br /><br />I wanted to love this dress, but was pretty disappointed how see through it is."
1.0,"“International” is spelled wrong, the material and color are completely different than shown"
1.0,"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR MY WATCH BROKE AFTER WEARING IT ,,,NEVER AGAIN"
1.0,Product was a big disappointment. It came 2 days later than told and arrived mangled and with a large hole in one hat.
1.0,"Fur very snug and short. The arms were fine but if you have larger breasts, this is not for you!"
1.0,Fits huge
1.0,For the price I believe that was going to get a lot bigger chain and lock it lucky my wife left it if not I would have returned it
1.0,"The shoe is very uncomfortable, slippery soles, not happy with quality"
1.0,I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM AND IT APPEARS DELIVERED
1.0,They arrived very quickly but the sole is so thin it ripped in a matter of a few wears...
1.0,Was sent a what seemed to be a fake watch.
1.0,Awful!!!!  Today was the first time i used the umbrella and wouldn't you know it i walked outside into the rain and it snaped in half.  It can't take any wind.  Not something i would waste my money on at all
1.0,Not at all as I figured. The emblem was only held on by a stitch. The fabric was very cheap.  There was random emblems on the shirt like someone accidentally sewed it in the wrong place.
1.0,"I was hoping to wear this classy jumpsuit for a Christmas picture with my family, however upon receiving it I realized what a mistake it was to order this because the material was like a cheap halloween costume and looks nithing like the picture! It is cheap and poorly made! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,"Whatever I tried, I couldn't get the switch to work and turn on the lights. There is no instruction with item, or on Amazon. A definite disappointment!"
1.0,Very thin fabric quality
1.0,This dress was not what I was expecting it to be. It’s way to revealing and tight for me! Not my style
1.0,This dress is so beautiful but it doesn’t cover your butt ! Mine was hanging out the bottom :( really wanted it to work out
1.0,Ugly. I'm not 80.
1.0,Looks ugly
1.0,"Never wore in my pool or shower & after 3 days it turned colors! Very disappointed , waste of money."
1.0,No no no
1.0,"Honestly this was really bad.<br />I wouldn't have paid more than $1 for this if I knew how bad the quality would be. The neck part is super hard and stiff...even a little itchy. This kind of material is not meant to be worn like this, it gives into no movement....and it's your neck and your neck moves.<br />It bothered me all day and at the end of the day I took it off and my neck was red where it was because it was irritated.<br />Super poor quality."
1.0,"For starters, the black bands are NOT as pictured. They're cheap looking and the hot glue was visible. Secondly, thanks for sending the hats folded into small squares. The creases are ridiculous. Returning them asap."
1.0,I bought a size bigger than I usually do and it still didn't fit. It was too tight to close the zipper. Wanted to return it but the rain we just got in Tennessee made my internet go out for 2 weeks. Came on today to find out that i'm not allowed to return it. I do no recommend buying from this seller. Waste of money.
1.0,Sizing is large.  Fabric thick and heavy..
1.0,"extremely thin fabric, almost see through. it looks nothing like the picture, i ordered a navy blue and it came black"

1.0,HORRIBLE fabric.. it is small that could fit on my 6 years old daughter.. definitely returning it
1.0,Very itchy and bad pull on band. Scratchy and uncomfortable.
1.0,Pearl's were to large for my taste.  Price was too high for gold plating.
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this. I bought 2 and they both leaked. They don’t even offer exchange or return.
1.0,Too bad that I washed it already I can't return it anymore. This is impossible to wear. No zipper or button anywhere. I cannot put it on at all. What a waste of money. Why do you do this to people???
1.0,"Don't Bother. Arrived missing stones and with others discolored and ugly yellow/brown, presumably because of the glue used to adhere them. I wasn't expecting a very high quality piece, but I WAS expecting it to be non-defective at minimum."
1.0,"Disappointed, finish started wearing off. Does hold up to daily use."
1.0,"The snowsuit is a little small, but is good quality. I was unhappy with the sellers because when the snow suit arrived it STANK! it smelled horrible. I contacted the sellers and they told me that was not possible. Do not expect great customer service, but I was able to get the smell out and it will work for my daughter.<br />***<br />Update! This snowsuit is poor quality, it broke after 2 weeks of regular use by my daughter. Thoroughly disappointed."
1.0,"False advertising. The metal looks like cheap steel, not silver. There is no 925 markings.<br /><br />Update: Worn for several months. Backs are green. This is not silver."
1.0,"I was so disappointed with this purchase.  It looked so good in the picture, but when I tried, it was so bad and did not fit good.  I will never buy this bra again.<br /><br />Sharleen S."
1.0,Too small. It's says to order up a size but I did and it still fit like a small<br />It's not worth the money<br />Don't do it!
1.0,It is very thin and flimsy. Maybe it would be better with a belt.
1.0,"It broke within 15 minutes of wearing it. I peiced it back together , then it broke 20 minutes later. This was while taking a few pictures on the beach before dinner"
1.0,I had to return them three times for different sizes but literally those different sizes are all same sizes.
1.0,Extremely sheer almost like pantyhose
1.0,The magnification is not good and the lens viewing is AWFUL!
1.0,"Cropped top, not as pictured. I dislike crop tops, I'm not 19 anymore. Shorter sleeved as well. I have long arms, was not the look it portrays"
1.0,"Runs really, really small. Sizing is terribly wrong."
1.0,"Bottoms are hideous and they came to me with a hole in them, the top is border line….if I tighten the straps then it rides up in back and front if I loosen the straps then I fall out! I got the blue and it’s not even close to the same color"
1.0,Side was split to high
1.0,THIS DOES NOT FIT PANDORA bracelets. It is to SMALL to go on the opening of the pandora bracelet.
1.0,"I've never had stainless steel earrings before and I will never buy them again. I love the size and design of these earrings but they are entirely TOO HEAVY. If I wore them, they would eventually rip my ears. Not worth sending them back, it will just be a lesson learned for future purchases."
1.0,Not what I was hoping you. They are extremely small and more on the heavier side which makes it hard to hang them.
1.0,One side didn’t fit. I sent them back
1.0,"Can I give part of this 4-5 stars, and part of it 1 star?<br />I ordered the multi-pack, with one tan, one black, and one pinkish bralette.  The tan and the black were fine, fit well, felt good.<br />However, the pinkish is horrible!  It's not a stretchy cotton jersey like the other two; it's some thickish, almost ribbed, not stretchy, uncomfortable fabric that doesn't fit at all because of the lack of stretch.<br />I requested a replacement order, hoping that my first order was an anomaly, but the second was exactly the same! Guess I'll be returning both orders. Sad, as I really like the colors in this multi-pack."
1.0,Hats were shoved into a zip bag and the brim folded over. Won't buy again.
1.0,I’m really disappointed. I bought the boots less then 2 months ago and it fell apart. I bought to my 8 years old hoping she will use till the next winter and the boots did not last until the end of this one. I cannot return it because the return window finish 20 days ago. Very upsetting.
1.0,"This is so tight and fits like a long shirt, just past my hips.  It is so short it shows my panties"
1.0,I liked the styles. But they were falling apart when I was trying to tie them together.
1.0,"Not Genuine Leather THEY ARE PLASTIC AND POOR QUALITY<br />Holes not punched all the way through<br />Out of 14 colors I received 5 pieces of 4 different colors<br />EXTREMELY disappointed<br />Will update if seller resolves, for now, BUYER BEWARE"
1.0,God these are just horrible hahahaha don’t even bother
1.0,These are very annoying to put on. Returned
1.0,"Horrible product, cheap china made. You get what you buy. The nose piece broke off within a couple of days of wearing them cause I had to adjust them constantly to make the lens match up with my eye. Definitely would not buy these."
1.0,Fell apart the second time I wore it. Garbage.
1.0,Waaaay too small.
1.0,It's to big and nothing like what the model has on
1.0,Not as pretty as in the picture.  The cameo is not a cameo:  it is a blurred  peach oval.  Unfortunally I ordered 2!  The shipment took a long time to arrive.
1.0,Not only did I order a 7 to 9 year old dress that wouldn't fit a four year old it looks nothing like the picture. It wouldn't not unzip all the way (zipper was stuck). This dress overall did not please me at all. Don't expect to get what's in the picture or you will be disappointed.
1.0,There are no pockets. It says there is pockets. The material is plush and cozy- but it pulls easily. Not very well made for the price. A
1.0,"Ugggh I wish I had read the reviews before I clicked &#34;buy&#34;, the skirt looks NOTHING like the picture. It looks and feels like it is made of suit lining polyester. Reminds me of a cheap Halloween costume. The word &#34;ballroom&#34; should be removed from any hint of a description of this skirt."
1.0,"The pattern is very pretty, the size is very large. I have a little one who wears a 10 very nicely and this was way to big. The material is cheap. Silky soft but cheap. She is 56” tall 70lbs"
1.0,"I'm not sure who the large pants are meant to fit, but my 10 year old niece couldn't fit these and she's not thick. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I was so excited to get this for my niece for Christmas. However even though it was completely wrapped up in bubble wrap it can broken in half and there’s no returns on this item. So pissed right now.
1.0,They scratch way too easily. My toddler scratched them as soon as I gave them to her. Very disappointed in the quality. Do not buy!!
1.0,Ordered larger based on reviews... still too short for an adult body.  Width was okay.
1.0,Very sad that when we took it out the package it was damaged! Super cute except the letters which is why i go it
1.0,watch is not ultra thin as described.
1.0,not worth the money!
1.0,Didn't fit the phone at all.
1.0,"Order 2 for my kids, love the fact that they are protected from the sun but the material Is horrible, took them swimming the first day recieved and after I noticed they material hot small balls all over and the material looks as if it's starting to shred and I haven't even washed it yet. I can tell of I wash it it will get worse, or the more they wear it itll get worse.For this price could i have bought a name brand suit that wouldn't do this,Very disappointed and will never order from Your company ever again"
1.0,Terrible Halloween fabric and a knock of of sourpuss clothing.
1.0,"Very cute, but I ordered three prints/colors of the same size and they were all different. And all too big. The quality is just not there."
1.0,Over priced for a string with a piece of anchor shaped plastic.
1.0,Whoever came up with the idea to put an actual switch on a belt buckle should get an award for the dumbest idea of this century. I thought this was like the old version until I tried it on and was required to hit a switch to open and get the belt off. You have to hit the switch every time to get the buckle off. Unbelievable!
1.0,"Found the dress way too small, I am usually a size large figured the dress ran small so I had ordered a XL, yes the dress runs 2 sizes small very very disappointed. As now I am stuck with the dress, as I stated so disappointing."
1.0,"I'm the queen of leggings..I live in them. As a busy mom of three I still want to look out together and feel comfortable and these leggings are exactly that. You can pair these with sneakers and crop top because they are super high waisted, or u can pair it with a dressy shirt and boots and you look out together within minutes. I'm bottom heavy. Super curvy and thick thighs and waist , these don't compress all of that but they enhance that and are super soft and stretchy sign once again the high waist which makes me feel more confident to wear tops I normally wouldn't wear. They do compress the waist area . For the price you can't beat it. I've ordered black ones over and over because they last a good couple months and lots of wear and wash. The burgundy is very very cute. Those two colors hide any cellulite and the high waist goes up a bit higher in the back so bending over you don't need to worry about panties showing or having to pull them up constantly , but one thing they are alitle thin and I'd be careful about wearing panties with thick panty thins. The length is perfect for y'all tall girls like me. Finally leggings that go to my feet. I'm 5'7 and they are actually to my ankle not like most leggings that turn into capris  . I dry them in my dryer no issues..I buy the one size not plus size , they will first fit very tight and look small but after a couple times you break them in and they fit perfectly. I'm curvy once again 150 pounds and thick bottom. When I was pregnant I was up to 190 at eight months and these still fit and I ordered the one size and supper comfy for tummy."
1.0,One half inch shorter than specified. Will return.
1.0,"Disliked the fit of the shoe. Extremely too big! Also, the shoes were shipped in a bag too small, they were smashed up."
1.0,"I just received this and when I tried to turn on the fan, either the motor or the fan is broken. I tried hooking it up to a battery pack to see if the fan would work but it does not. Very disappointed."
1.0,Terribly cheap. Material actually looked worn at edges.
1.0,"Too thin, not as pictured"
1.0,"Not cut like the picture at all. Ordered a medium and they slid off me so returned for a small and I couldn’t even get them on. However, the lacy part was loose around my ankles. I don’t exactly have small calves and I have no idea why they were so long, either."
1.0,Very disappointed! They were not true to size for a adult . Now if you are getting this for a small child that may work. Not worth the time and money.
1.0,Came in the package broken. Very poor packaging and very poor material. Not acceptable
1.0,The style is very attractive but the gold ring is discolored.
1.0,"These masks are a huge disappointment! Way too tight, making it very difficult to breath properly! The ear loops are rather small with no capability to adjust for better comfort! I was hoping that the silver-cooper addition would make the masks more breathable, but when I got them I realized that those materials were at a very small proportion (9% silver infused polyester  and 4% copper infused polyamide) compared “polyamide” at a and additional huge 64%. 18% nylon, another name for polyamide! 5% spandex, another chemical material! These masks are completely unhealthy and should not be permitted in the market, specially during these crazy times of face coverings! Is Myrant Inc. in for our health or for the money! Please issue a FAST REFUND!<br /><br /> A little bit about polyamide:<br />Polyamide is a petroleum based plastic material and its unbreathable!!!!<br /><br />Polyamide production releases nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere as a byproduct. It's a considerably powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to catalytic stratospheric ozone destruction, according to scientific research. It accumulates over a lifetime of about 150 years.<br /><br />Nitrous oxide is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) and 15 times more than methane because it traps far more infrared radiation.<br /><br />The amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is increasing by about 0,2% per year due to the high rates of global adipic acid production necessary for the condensation polymerize of polyamides.<br /><br />Polyamide fabric production has huge negative impacts on the environment and human health.<br /><br />Many workers in polyamide production facilities are exposed to dust and fumes. They irritate the eyes, nose, throat, and skin.<br /><br />The negative consequences of polyamide fabric production don’t end there. Polyamide fabric isn't biodegradable or compostable. It increases our consumption of fossil fuels and dependency.<br /><br />Polyamide fabric takes hundreds of years to decompose. As polyamide breaks down, it releases toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases into the environment.<br /><br />Synthetic fabrics like polyamide destroy ecosystems and nature. They contribute to the high amount of clothing waste that ends up in landfills every year.<br /><br />Polyamide fabric releases plastic microfibers into the environment that pollute entire food chains, kill land and marine wildlife, and endanger human health.<br /><br />These plastic microfibers are consumed by fish and birds and end up in our food, lungs, and stomachs."
1.0,Did not fit the ear for the person it was bought for.
1.0,Way cheesy cheap looking
1.0,"No me llego del color que la pedí , pero es bonita"
1.0,The necklace is beautiful and I love the resin material it is made of! But it arrived broken and missing beads.
1.0,NEVER RECEIVED IT. SELLER NEVER CONTACTED ME 😡
1.0,"I ordered a size 11 and they are a extra long size 11,plus they are a lighter color than shown, almost a light orange. Would not buy them again."
1.0,Fell apart before I could wear it. Returned it for a refund.
1.0,Broke after my one week of use
1.0,"I'm not at all happy. It's whatever though. I expected this shirt to be cotton but when I got it, it's the same crappy material this use to make childrens Halloween costumes. Not even kidding. Even the bottom seam is straight from a costume. For under $5 I'm not too pissed about it, just disappointed. I wish you knew ahead of time when things you order come from China. I never know until I've ordered and it says what carrier it's mailing with."
1.0,SIZES WAY TOO SMALL.  DOES NOT FIT MOST AS IT SAYS
1.0,I love the color of the shoe but they were way too big too wide too long did not fit and I could not get my money back very disappointed
1.0,They hurt my feet and my legs not very comfortable there not small they fit my feet fine or just not a comfortable shoe
1.0,"Cute necklace, but wouldn't recommend, was broken when i received it in the mail."
1.0,Not what I expected and they are fake metal I’m allergic to them
1.0,See through and had to be returned.
1.0,Item is too big and no returns.
1.0,"I  am a size 12 so I ordered these pants in a large. Well, the large doesn't even fit my niece, who is a size 4. These pants are ""doll sized""! Do Not Order Them."
1.0,Terrible! Very short in length ! Gave it away!
1.0,"Ordered this watch after my Casio 10 year battery watch expired. This watch runs perfectly while laying flat on a tabletop but when I put it on my wrist it runs for a couple of hours and then just quits. Will not restart until I take it off, reset the time and lay it flat on a table. Then it runs perfectly again. Gave it four chances to perform properly; didn't happen so it's on its way back to Amazon"
1.0,"Not at all what I was expecting. Was not happy with the product at all. It is way too thick to use on the inside of clothing, heavy enough to sag your clothing if you try to use it, and not very flexible because of the thickness (so it is not invisible even from the inside). I have not used it once since purchasing for these reasons. Maybe the smaller version would be more useful."
1.0,"Got sold a used shirt?  Clearly had been worn and washed before, more than once?  Texture and shrinkage were dead giveaways.  Plus the smell of deodorant took on it.  Gross."
1.0,Broken after wearing twice.
1.0,"They are simply yellow. They do absolutely nothing of benefit. Nothing has reduced glare. And hey, while driving at night, it is always an exciting challenge to have BOTH intense glare AND less light. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,I order this product but I was looking for neon green fur cover but I did not get neon green I receive dark green I will like to send back
1.0,"I loved the look of the dress and the quality seemed great. However, it was WAY too small. I had ordered an XL and it was more like a size small. I was sad due to loving the style and color/pattern."
1.0,"These do not close, the clasp isn't correct. The colors are dull and shipping package is flimsy. 2 of mine were missing."
1.0,You have to have big boobs to wear this
1.0,The fit was all wrong! The sleeves on the top are super tight! The shorts are a little small they don’t fit me!
1.0,"These are darling design and fit well - comfortable.  I loved them, at first.  However, it didn't take long before they lost color and they all looked the same.  Poor quality.  Sent back for refund."
1.0,This is just a sweater. Does not look anything like the picture
1.0,Very cute dress and good quality. The cut of the dress is great except for the top. The top is cut for a child that has yet to go thru puberty. I an very small breasted and it made me look like a boy bc it squashed the boobs flat. Like I said I am small breasted so there is no reason the top should be this small.
1.0,These did not hold up at all. Ripped so easily.  Waste of money.
1.0,This bra was very oddly shaped and sewn together. It didn’t provide any support whatsoever and the straps were sewn on way to wide. The fabric was also fraying on the sides of the bra.
1.0,Too Small and No Return.
1.0,This is the poorest quality of anything that I've bought on Amazon to date.  It fits like a threadbare blanket with buttons.  I returned it immediately!
1.0,i have the smallest ankles in the world and this was too small for me.  I think it was made for a 5 year old.
1.0,Doesn't fit and It's unconfortable
1.0,Poor quality. Seams were frayed and coming undone. The material is not as pictured.  It is very shiny  and too stretchy.
1.0,It’s not accurate with the image at all.
1.0,The v line in the front is so low that the shoulders don't fit right. Looks awkward.
1.0,"Terrible product! Do not buy! I wasn't even able to wear these once. When they came the backs were bent flat so they couldn't be worn. I had to bend them out to the original shape to wear them and the post completely broke off one of the earrings. So I'm left with one earring, and the other with a broken post so I was unable to even wear them"
1.0,Cheap imitation. Design is a blurry copy of a real XC shirt. Now having trouble returning. Stay away from this seller.
1.0,Ended up returning item. It was poor quality and looked cheap. The necklace was too small and almost broke at the clasp when trying on for the 1st time.
1.0,"The skirt was the perfect length. I did not like the leggings, they were baggy and so I cut them out."
1.0,"Returning out of the box because it had a rip in the hem at the front pleats (right under the bust) so it wasn't even possible to cover up or make work somehow.  Didn't realize until writing the review that it should have came w a belt, but it didnt; now wondering if the belt ripped off at some point causing the rip... Everyone else's photos look a lot different in color and material than what I received.  Was a nice dress either way, but not with a big rip in the front.  If it didn't have the rip it would work just fine, followed the size chart and was still a little snug... my daughter is usually a 14/16 and ordered the XL, a little tight around the chest which made the collar bulge all awkward like...  the fabric is more of a heavy nylon or polyester than a soft cotton one of the photos suggested, too."
1.0,"Finally received my shoes which were ordered in over 2 months ago.  Be warned.  These shoes looked nothing like the pictures that are shown to us.  They are very cheap material, both upper and lower parts of shoe. The only thing you could call leather on these booties are the tongue, which was too short for the booties.  The adjustable lace to secure the shoes to your liking is useless.  But the worst is the SMELL.  I have worked around formaldehyde and thats what these shoes smelled like.  I have tried to return for a refund but it cost almost $12 to return!  I've sent an email to ask that they pay for the S&H.  Pretty sure they won't.  I'll just take this as a lesson learned.  I will stay away from this company and any others that reviews state having to wait for a long period for product delivery.  So you know.  The booties have been sitting out in my garage for over a week and they still reek of chemicals.  If we could give minus stars I would."
1.0,Cheap material inside
1.0,"Don’t buy, not custom fit."
1.0,My nephew had it for two days and it ripped. It was definitely not the best quality. It was super cute though.
1.0,This simply cups and does not hold up at all. Unless you’re a A cup I would not recommend it.
1.0,Broke to easy
1.0,Does not work. Wore it twice in the water and it died. So it clearly it is not waterproof at all
1.0,I only bought these for the bottle opener that was supposed to be on the bottom as advertised.  There is no bottle opener on the bottom.  These are just plain ole flip flops.  I’m so mad. I bought these for one of my anniversary gifts to husband and when he opened them there was no bottle opener.  He already has a pair of flip flops and I only bought these because I thought it was cool it had a bottle opener. I’m so dissatisfied.
1.0,It was 3 sizes too small no where near a 2 x it was also way too long sleeves and total length it would not hit anyone at the knees it drags the ground
1.0,Doesnt fit. Made very small
1.0,Knockoff product. Came from China and wasn't what was advertised.
1.0,Too small. How frustrating. I bought size “14” and fit my daughter who is size 12.5-13 sooooo small. She loved them. She’s so sad that I have to return:<br />So disappointed
1.0,nowhere near the size as listed.
1.0,Ripped right away and of course I’m one day past the return window!
1.0,It’s cheap and broke prior to first use
1.0,Cheap crap
1.0,cute bracelet but gems fell off first time wearing it.
1.0,"It's cute enough that I'll keep it, but the quality does not match the price. Beware."
1.0,Very uncomfortable in the crotch area. The midline seam rises up in the crotch.
1.0,It started turning black after a week.
1.0,Six weeks in and the rubber is already separating from the fabric on the front of the shoe.
1.0,"Buyer Beware, this sweater runs in a size that is 2-3 sizes larger than US sizes. Quality of the knit is extremely poor, and the fabric itself reeks of chemicals.<br /><br />HORRIBLE."
1.0,Shirt is too small in the arms
1.0,sewed  unevenly<br />See through material
1.0,There are tiny holes in the seams and pockets of the dress. Threads hanging out everywhere. Cannot be worn.
1.0,"I got this because it was cute and when I got it, I was very unhappy. Once i wore this, it kept falling off! don't waste your money, its not worth it."
1.0,Zero stars for this item. This super cute band would not lock in place.
1.0,"I have small breasts. B cup. These stick well but they just kinda hang on the breasts making them look flat and saggy. There isn’t any lift or support. It’s too bad too, I was really looking forward to the look that was in my mind’s eye."
1.0,Super flimsy.
1.0,"Disappointing. I bought these earrings in January and they didn't show up until March. And when they did it was on the very last delivery estimate day. The gold spikes are super cheap plastic that keep falling out. Worst Amazon purchase by far. Don't waste your time, or your dollar. Didn't even get to wear them..."
1.0,Going to return because the size small that I ordered fits more like a large. Very disappointed!
1.0,Washed on delicate and tumble dried on low and after 2 washed the material is already starting to pill.<br /><br />I bought it to replace my favorite shirt and unfortunately this one just didn’t do it.
1.0,Received it today..I'm rarely disappointed.in my orders. I will be giving it away.
1.0,Not good sizing really bad.
1.0,It was great for a month.  But already broken and in the garbage
1.0,Over priced and cheap clasp
1.0,poor material. loose at the end of the dress instead of it to be tight. the ruffle is too plain and weak.  was disapointed at the look of it. I just dumped it in the trash.
1.0,do not buy products made in china imo unless you have no other way to find them
1.0,Y’all this was a complete crap purchase. I ordered a 3x because it runs small and I have boobs. Y’all my 97 pound 13 year old barely fit into it. Also the material just feels gross.
1.0,Toooo tight toe to heal and so wide your foot doesn't stay in it. I rate it a minus 1
1.0,I was unhappy with this product it clap does not stay closed  and I lost one already...
1.0,Stitching was com and ng put everywhere! Looked nothing like the picture! Cheap thin seen thru scratchy material. I could of hand stitched this better and I have 0 experience in that arena.
1.0,"broke within a week, very poorly made"
1.0,"I would have given this 5 stars, but, now I have a black ring around my neck.  That's not cool.  So, now I have to find another chain."
1.0,Spanx is an overrated brand. I've had shape wear from smaller companies that Work just as well. These ride up forget any other reviews that say other wise. There is no right way to put them on. I followed someone else's instructions in theit review to put them on and it didnt work. They don't stay in place.
1.0,Opened on Christmas and has already broke not even new years yet.
1.0,"Loved these at first, but after very little wear on my ‘gentle footed’ 7 year old they have both had to be stitched back up on the sides. While they still function it’s disappointing  that I’ve had to fix them so soon."
1.0,The material and print are aweful and cheap. It feels like a fast food uniform.  The fit is awkward as well. Save your money.
1.0,broke the first week of wearing it
1.0,"The product was great at first, but lost seal and fell apart after a few uses.  Definitely do both use in salt water. Very disappointing.  It appeared decent quality but clearly was not."
1.0,With in a couple of week it's change the color and looked molded and nasty please don't waste your money on it.
1.0,Waited almost two months to receive it . It's too large.  Ugly dress.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and its runs very small.....
1.0,Horrible material. I ordered my usual size and it fit about two sizes to big. This is by far one of the worst items I have ordered from Amazon.
1.0,"1.  These gloves REEK of formaldehyde.  It makes you wonder what's infesting their factory.<br />2. Fingers are too long for a medium.<br />3. Very cheaply made.<br /><br />Overall, this product sucks."
1.0,Super poor quality. This Tee is not actually bleached. The whole shirt was printed to look bleached but not and its a weird material bleand. Not full cotton.
1.0,Fits like a junior top not an 1X top I believed I was ordering
1.0,Pretty but very poor quality. Some rhinestones fell out first time I wore them.
1.0,The size chart is not accurate and the shirts are a lot cuter in the picture.
1.0,loved the product not appropriately sized
1.0,The size is very small and nothing like what is displayed
1.0,"In my opinion I guess for 13.00 its fine, but mine feels like thick paper and the latching that attaches to the Apple Watch is not secure, slides back and forth. I dont use it anymore, because I don’t trust it to hold the watch on my wrist. My advice is to spend the extra 20 and get a proper leather strap."
1.0,This jacket was not a good buy for me. I have bought Kenneth Cole Brfore and this Jacket is not a real Kenneth Cole.
1.0,"Bought this to find the ring size of my husband in silicon rings, rings don’t state the size they are most of them are the same size only one or two are actually bigger than the rest and only by one size. Terrible product"
1.0,Started falling apart after first use
1.0,"This is a great concept. I am disappointed because the suction cups come off the bib. Which means they get lost or even worse, while your husband is shaving, one side falls off and poof- there goes all his hair all over everything.. that sucks.. worse than before I bought it. If the suction cups were not detachable and didn't just fall off all the time, this would be a decent product."
1.0,I am a large man  and have very large wrists.  The watch band did not fit and I had to return it.
1.0,"PROS: Does keep your hands warm and toasty like regular gloves, probably not frigid weather but good enough.<br /><br />CONS: 1. The finger tips are terrible. You have to press hard on the screen or pull the gloves down on your hand to function.<br />  2. DO NOT TOUCH WET THINGS IN WINTER!!! I have on accident and the experience was dreadful."
1.0,I bought this for my mom and she didn’t even get to wear it. The chain broke before she could even put it on.
1.0,Ugly plastic encased - looks nothing like the picture. I thought it would be delicate and tasteful.
1.0,Was the worst watch band I've ever bought I will not ever recommend it to anybody I put it on for the first time and it tore in half the first10 minutes into wearing it
1.0,This was too short and too small and I bought the larger size I can wear.  I also wasn't thrilled with the fabric.  It sure looks pretty in the picture though.  I returned it.
1.0,This product is one of those styles where the waist sits lower and slides down so you constantly feel like you have to pull them up. That is my number one pet peeve and I do not recommend anyone buy these unless you enjoy that. In addition to that I find it really odd that there’s a seam going right down the crotch area so that looks weird and the waistband part is so large that it makes your butt look really unflattering. Not to toot my own horn but I have a pretty cute nice butt and these shorts definitely do not do it justice.
1.0,Late but still like it.. Pretty thank you
1.0,"Cute design but terrible quality, second use and while my baby sitted watching tv, pum.. see the picture"
1.0,"Do not purchase unless you are a little person, fairy, or munchkin.  Took it out of package and looked like it was made for a 2 year old child.  Returned it immediately.  And I bought the XXL."
1.0,This runs at least 2 sizes smaller than what it says.  I couldnt wear it.
1.0,Looks better on the picture..
1.0,These masks don’t look like the pic and don’t fit the description. They are of a very thin fabric and don’t have pocket for the filter. Also they don’t have nose clip. I didn’t return bcus I wasn’t going g to waste more money on return charges
1.0,They are cheap in price and you can tell...they are not as delicate as these photos make them appear.
1.0,Only lasted a month. Came apart pretty quickly.
1.0,"Warning, this is not a dress!  It is so short my daughter will have to wear it as a shirt.  I ordered a 3t and it is shorter than her old 12 month clothes.  The material is super cheap, feels rough and one snap on anything and it’s ruined.  Save your money and don’t purchase this."
1.0,Loved the look of this but the actual rod is too short! It wouldn't fit in my belly button properly so I'm not even gonna try. It would be my first change out since getting it pierced and I don't wanna risk infecting my piercing. Wish it was longer cause it super cute and exactly what I wanted looks wise
1.0,Ball was very cheap quality.
1.0,Nice quality way too small
1.0,No sirve
1.0,Just not what I expected - super see through and very cheap thin material. I would not buy again. Even the tie (lace) on the top was just in the bag so had to try and thread it through little lacing holes just a waste of money really. If I hadnt washed it I would have returned it.
1.0,This looks like I am wearing a sack. The color is awful in person too. The only reason I am keeping it is because it is long enough to cover my assets.
1.0,Don't waste your money on this very cheap made!!
1.0,"This mask is useless, it’s a single layer very thin fabric. Will not help block airborne covid particles. Would not recommend."
1.0,Hat did not come with sweat protection pad as shown in selling pictures...
1.0,Basically a kids toy.
1.0,not what i expected..too flared
1.0,"Highly disappointed .  I bought these gloves as a gift the gloves came with a hole in one of the fingers, and the box for the gloves was damaged.  They were intended as a Christmas gift, I could not give them as a gift in that condition."
1.0,"The fit is nothing like it as shown. It was wasted money. I won't order from them again, with it coming from China it's just not easy to return when not satisfied."
1.0,Completely different then the pictures! I returned it.
1.0,"Color is not rose pink but more like rose gold.  Band has two magnets that make putting the watch on, adjusting the band and removing the watch a struggle.  Returned it."
1.0,Basically. You get what you pay for.!!!  Poor quality and the material shines. If your on a budget feel free to purchase
1.0,Fell apart at the armpit seams the first night I wore it! Extremely cheap quality! Wasn’t expecting top of the line. Before the night was over it was tore from the elbows down below the side of my breast. I never buttoned it. And it was bought big on me. Most disappointing clothing item I’ve ever purchased off Amazon.
1.0,"Complete garbage, zero quality ripped in seam after one wearing."
1.0,This hat is as goofy looking as the picture.<br /><br />Their other products are better.
1.0,This came in and was way larger than I expected.  Order down.
1.0,The criss cross in all socks broke.  I had to hand see them there others that are much better.
1.0,These are crap. Fall apart crap
1.0,This dress is extremely see through which we did not find in the reviews... Also is not meant for shorter girls. The top portion of the dress would have to be altered as the bodice is long & therefore does not cover the chest area as it cuts in too much.
1.0,"The color is much more green than blue and the band adjustable, not solid as shown. Gumball machine quality ring. Will go in my nieces play jewelry box."
1.0,"Not sure I got this on Amazon or Woot.  Worked when I tested them or arrival, but when I got ready to use them, they went on buzz until the battery was depleted. Nowhere is there a manual that I can find. The feedback loop on when they are recording is some kind of buzzing, but you are never sure they are working.<br />I guess I can depend on them as a regular visor without the video aspect."
1.0,There was a size deception.  I ordered on an extra large and received an unknown size because the tag size had been removed from the shirt.  At best I received a medium that was trying to be passed off as an XLarge.
1.0,Why is this saying 3pc and I only received the top ?
1.0,"They turn black real quicl,is a waste  of money. Don't buy them."
1.0,Returned stones had no color
1.0,Previously used and ripped. Not worth a penny.Real trash.
1.0,"The picture appears to have a fairly straight leg line. When I tried these on the leg flared out below my knee. It appeared to be a mini bell bottom below my knee which I did not like. I had to return them. Otherwise, they were a nice fit."
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. The earrings arrived broken and I had a short window to request an exchange during which I was out of town so once I found out they were broken it was too late. They are sitting in the package on my desk useless. What a waste of money.
1.0,Falls apart before even putting on
1.0,Cheap...looks like it came from the dollar store.
1.0,Ordered a size up and still to small
1.0,"came broken, looks CHEAP!!! ladies, do not order."
1.0,Poor threading
1.0,This item in description and shown says I love you always and forever but did not come as described the inscription is left off very disappointed to late to return very deceiving!!! Will definitely not buy from again !!
1.0,no stretch.  couldn't get them over my heel.
1.0,I ordered an XXL for my boyfriend... it fit like it was a Medium - Half Shirt... belly shirts on a man... not the look I want for my guy.  I'm disappointed because I have purchased other items from this brand... this doesn't do the company any justice!
1.0,"The fit is awful in the bust area, just an awful overpriced compare to other cheaper bathing suits here"
1.0,It’s too bad this bracelet doesn’t look like the photo. The champagne stone (peachy orange) bracelet only comes in ROSE gold and not yellow gold (as pictured). IRL it’s peach overkill (to me) and the yellow gold suits it better. I’m so disappointed because I really wanted this item.
1.0,"Couldn’t even put it on without the buttons busting open. It was just fitted, not too tight."
1.0,"It only came with one wristband, there should have been two. Since my kid ripped it open, I can't really return it but he's pretty disappointed."
1.0,Really nice jacket and good quality but I will return it because it is way too big.  Hopefully I can get it in a smaller size.
1.0,"Tried adjusting the frame and the stupid things snapped. Cheap product. And no amount of glue (tried super glue, e6000, and hot glue), solder, or tape would fix it. Regretful purchase."
1.0,Made in China way too small. Not even close to the size I ordered should be
1.0,"I personally would not recommend this chain. It tarnished 2 days after wearing it. I was able to buff out some of the tarnish, however, it returned immediately. Even placing it in liquid jewelry cleaner doesn’t help. Waste of money!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:244d47cd4b53aa689a7bbe82bb237950]] Fits good material is sturdy but not all one material.
1.0,Do not fit true to size and AWFUL quality.
1.0,"This product is garbage. As other reviewers said, the medal is cheaply made. There is glue on the heart shaped medal. The George Washington profile is off-centered. It was sloppily glued to the right side of the heart. It is supposed to be centered. Do not purchase this. The only positive is that Amazon gave me my money back as soon as a I returned it to the UPS Store."
1.0,"The two Sabers arrived promptly and one of them arrived undamaged. The other arrived with some sort of dirty fluid stain on the blade. Since the description doesn't describe the material well enough, I'll do it:<br />The blade is what I expected the whole sword to be made of, it's made of a dense, soft styrofoam material.<br />The handle is made of a regular cloth material, inadequately stuffed with cotton (like a teddy bear). For $8.99 + $hipping + tax, I expected a better product. Had this had a better description I would not have purchased this item. This is like something you get from the Dollar Store."
1.0,broke after one wear.
1.0,Had piercings put in by a professional and the same day the opal head fell off already stripped. Tried to message seller and no response.
1.0,Came after months. Worse quality ever. Gave to my 9 year old sister. That's how small it was. Don't buy!
1.0,This item appeared used and came with a piece missing. It was clearly not asymmetrical. The box that it came in was old with extra 3 odd earring backs in it and what appeared to look like mold. I am very disappointed because I have a ball tonight and really needed a stunning necklace to carry off my dress. I will be returning this defective used item for a full refund! :-(
1.0,Not a good fabric! Cheaply made!
1.0,It’s very small and it was missing the sleeves. I’ll just give to my kid.
1.0,"This screen protector smudged constantly and wouldn't come clean. Also, it did not cover half of the face of the watch. Returned."
1.0,I haven’t even had this beautiful handbag for a full 24 hours and the zipper threads have come loose and one of the hooks on the sides where you can clip your strap on to has completely come off of the purse. I am very disappointed because it really is a beautiful pirse with so many compartments but I will not be promoting or referring anyone to buy this bag.
1.0,Fitting was not that great
1.0,Enormous! I’m 5’2 and I was swimming in it. Would be better for someone taller.
1.0,"The description says stainless steel, but my green wrist says brass/copper that's plated... Negative stars."
1.0,"This smelled so bad, I threw it away!!!  The description said GENUINE LEATHER--IT IS NOT LEATHER.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  This is a totally inferior product.  If I could have given zero stars, I would have, but it does not allow you to do that."
1.0,"Looks cute, but it's entirely see through and NOT flattering... if you're rail thin, it would probably look good on you, but curvy girls beware."
1.0,They have no elasticity.  The worst socks that I’ve had to wear since generic in the 1970’s!!!!  It’s unbelievable that they are even sold for more than a dollar per pair.  What a rip off!!!
1.0,"It fits too tight and i can see the back of the shirt through the front of the shirt when i hold it up.  I am not sure if that is normal for polyester because I haven't worn polyester since the 90s.<br /><br />If this shirt was the correct sizing and a quality cotton, it would sell to all of us gen x and boomers all day err day.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend going up one full size because you will need to wear an undershirt."
1.0,Posts on both earrings were bent.... great screw back.
1.0,"Wanted this to wear on Halloween, paid for the fastest shipping just to get a bad quality shirt, skirt, and ugly bows. It’s not a dress as advertising and it doesn’t look as good as advertised."
1.0,The picture is deceiving. It leaves out the half inch post that you see before the jewels start. Not very pretty or flattering. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Too small, Fit sideways, low quality, terrible look, sawn with wrinkles"
1.0,"Esta bonito, pero causa mucha comezon al ponertelo y queda pequeño"
1.0,"junk, get what you pay for"
1.0,"Sadly, this headband does not stay on my round head! I was hoping this would be the one I could wear after never finding one that didn’t work it’s  way off of my head within minutes. Cute, but doesn’t work on my “Charlie Brown” head!"
1.0,"So so hot to wear, threw it off as soon as i could.  Ended up with a sunburn but so much better than the heat of wearing this."
1.0,I work in oil refineries I have to climb ladders move around the latch made of poor quality.
1.0,CHEAP.
1.0,So poorly cut they do not fit my frames.  Almost look like they are the wrong lenses.  About half the thickness of stock lenses to boot.  A signature case of you get what you pay for.
1.0,"My mask was defective, had to send it back."
1.0,Only for one luggage
1.0,"Before I even get into the issues with this dress, I have to say that it is pretty. It doesn’t look exactly like the picture, but it’s pretty.<br /><br />It’s definitely more pink than the photos show. I looked at this dress on my phone, my laptop, & my desktop before purchasing because I know the screen can making colors appear different. It was much more pink than I was expecting. I was expecting a more subtle blush with undertones of peach. This is just PINK. A brighter pink than I expected, not the softer pink.<br /><br />You definitely need some sort of petticoat to give it a more voluminous, fluffy look because it falls flat.<br /><br />The material is extremely itchy. So itchy that my child could barely tolerate it long enough to see how it fit.<br /><br />It’s a bit more sheer in the skirt than the photographs make you believe, but a petticoat fixes this issue.<br /><br />As far as the length, it was perfect; however, that’s about as good as the sizing gets. Here’s the issue: the top (should be collar bones, arms) is see- through lace & then there’s some sort of polyester material that SHOULD wrap around the chest & stomach area. It doesn’t. The material is too low, so the chest is exposed. Because of the see-through lace up top, a camisole looks bad. So unless you want your child’s chest exposed, this dress really doesn’t work."
1.0,I returned as they were nice but totally overpriced. I’ll settle for a blanket and a thinner robe.
1.0,This dress is HORRIBLE! Came in a wrinkled ball and had a hole!
1.0,Trust me. Either it does not fit or they have terrible QC issues
1.0,Dry poorly made. Basically a piece of plastic with a marble piece of paper insert.
1.0,"This bag has caused more than a few mommy melt downs. Here are all the problems, in my opinion.<br /><br />1. It's  13 inches across. 14 inches high. And 4 inches deep. Did you catch that. It's tall and skinny. Guess what that means? It falls over all the time!<br />2. It's main compartment has no zipper closure. It has ONE magnet to close it in the center. So when it falls over, everything shifts and or falls out.<br />3. The front pockets have no zipper closure. Again, each pocket has one magnet in the center to keep it closed. Which means you can't put that much in them if you want them to stay closed. And when it falls over because it's tall and skinny.. all of your stuff is going to shift and or fall out of these pockets.<br />4. If you fill the internal pockets HALF WAY you've pretty much used all of the room in the main compartment.<br />5. The zipper pockets on the top, there's two of them, aren't deep. They're only about three inches deep and the bag if fourteen inches tall. Putting anything in them makes this tall and skinny bag top heavy so it's really going to fall over.<br />6. There aren't any feet on the bottom to help this fall over and spill everything problem in the slightest.<br /><br />I hate this bag. I love the brand name and have since bought another hop skip diaper bag that I'm madly in love with."
1.0,Totally disappointed in this product! It honestly feels as if I took a pair of old pantyhose and slipped them on.
1.0,My shirt had a hole in it when I received it.
1.0,Not good tracking having trouble contacting seller
1.0,Got the package but nothing in it.
1.0,Needed this for a 10 year old girl. Says it’s a girls skirt; It is NOT! These are adult sizes
1.0,"Very cheap fabric, I noticed holes in the shirt when I was expecting it after taking it out of it’s packaging. Will be returning; unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to even wear it."
1.0,There isn't any fleece on these tights.
1.0,"There is the option between a Tunic, or Tunic+Robe, to lead you to believe that the Tunic+Robe would come with the aforementioned Tunic, however it does not. You will need to order both the robe and the tunic separately. Robe is not worth being more expensive than the tunic on its own."
1.0,Way too big and long for my nose. Also not as rounded as they should be to look like a real piercing.
1.0,I ordered the size 12-14. I received a next size up.
1.0,The description states the glasses are round. They are not. They are oval. Another misrepresentation from Amazon.
1.0,Stuff is not good quality
1.0,Was very cheaply made.  Broken soon after wearing.  Will not buy again.
1.0,"They have no grip, they fall off your face. Quality is low,<br />I would no pay more than 1 dollar for these, sorry!"
1.0,Otraves me mandaron el equivocado mi pedido es una medida L i me mandaron una medida S
1.0,"Hard to snap together, flimsy, thin, snapped easily."
1.0,Has a space in back making u look wide and miss shaped
1.0,Loved the watch but they were both broke in the same spot
1.0,"What I received is definitely NOT 1/2 inch. Measures 3/4 inch no matter how you measure it. Exactly what I needed product wise, just to big."
1.0,nahh
1.0,"The sizing is way way off from the size chart.... the dress was extremely small across the chest and upper arms, could not even zipper it and the material had no stretch. In addition, the hat was folded over twice with deep crease marks."
1.0,Terrible _ don't buy it.
1.0,"I loved these when they first arrived. Within 3 wears a pocket started to fall apart. Now after maybe 15 wears total, all pockets are junk and hanging from the pants it's hideous. I wear these lounging ar home so they shouldn't fall apart. Absolute trash. Don't be fooled by how they look. They're not worth it!"
1.0,"My item came damaged, extremely dull as if it had been worn for years. Im not pleased at all and will return"
1.0,"Wore this once, washed it on delicate cycle & when I took it out of the washer to hang to dry it was unraveling at one of the shoulder straps.  Very disappointing!"
1.0,"Was really excited about this purchase. It's a joke. I ordered the Grey as seen. The actual advertised pants have a great unique design, and look like they're made of a durable army pants type, possibly waterproof material. The seller/ ""designer"" of what I received basically attempted to stitch the reflective tubing on sweatpants and create the same design. That's not even mentioned, or pictured in the ad. Basically false advertising, and it's not even close. There's loose string everywhere, and they even sowed one of the flaps of the front pocket into the waste seem."
1.0,Glass bottles arrived broken.
1.0,Leather wears off fast
1.0,Ugh.....no
1.0,Very thin see-through material seems very cheaply made.  Too small and I got larger than I needed.
1.0,The robe arrived dirty like it had been on the floor. Also had several hanging strings from being snagged. Too late to get anything else. Disappointed!
1.0,Barely fit my ten year old grandson in an adult small
1.0,"I ordered a small & it was HUGE. The material is ok, but nothing like a sweatshirt. Disappointed!"
1.0,"Came unraveled on one side after wearing for only 1/2 day. Could be a bad coincidence, or could be just bad craftsmanship."
1.0,I bought one that arrived without a stone. I bought another that the stone fell out only after a day or 2 of use!!!! Do not get this. It’s a shame because the ring is stunning but That means nothing if the stones fall off as soon as you put the ring on :(
1.0,"I like that it arrived finally. I did not like that it took weeks later than the expected date that was giving to me. The item is nicer in the pic. It’s bulky, not for you if you wants something elegant."
1.0,"Some of the screws backed out making these unusable, but these screws are smooth and no type of Philips/torx will fit, making these planned obsolescence once they get worn in. Lasted less than a month, do not buy!!"
1.0,Cheap flimsy shoes! Returning today!
1.0,"The pants were too small in the waist & hips, had to return it as there was nothing bigger."
1.0,Poor hat. More like a dollar store item. I would not purchase this item again. Purchase at your own risk.
1.0,"I know it says it's made from polyester, but honestly, this feels like the kind of polyester that would melt onto your body if you got too close to a candle. It's the cheapest of the cheap material. I can't even imagine what anyone's pits would smell like after a day of wearing this dress. No breathability. Yuck."
1.0,Horrible! After a week the band broke! I was very disappointed!
1.0,Unfortunately the elastic around the shoulders fell apart the first time I put this shirt on.  I did get a refund.
1.0,They are yellowish and not white.  For a wedding so it isn't going to work for me.
1.0,Size was not what it said it was
1.0,need to exchange  cannot access phone through the clear plastic as represented
1.0,"This product fell apart before I was able to wear it. I was traveling with it to a beach weekend and when I arrived it had a 'mouth'. I took it out the beach day and it began unraveling from the slit so quickly, it was 2 pieces before I knew it."
1.0,"Not a great fit for my girlfriend, want to return"
1.0,Didn't fit like photo
1.0,They don't give sizes on the top.. So how would I know but I did pick a large but is still don't fit .... The top is from Chinese of Japan and of course they were a lot smaller size .... I only gave one star but that don't deserve it either ....disappointment
1.0,"Initially I was excited to try it on and I noticed that the band was very elastic and so I had high hopes for this bra.  However when I tried it on, I noticed that the CUP area did not expand even the slightest.  The cup, although advertised as a D, was actually a small C cup.  Needless to say, I couldn't even get the zipper up, and my boobs were &#34;squashed&#34; as I was trying to zip it up.  I eventually gave up and realized that I had to return this bra."
1.0,"If I saw this hat in the dollar store, I would not purchase it. So imagine how disappointed I am that I paid roughly 20 bucks for this misshapen monstrosity.  The material/hat looks old and the shape is off (it is pointy at the top). The photo is misleading."
1.0,Too small will be returning this item
1.0,faded quick and dividers busted within 2 weeks.
1.0,I wore this for 3 days and a stone fell out
1.0,The money clip won't hold any money so it is useless.  I am going to return it and will probably get stuck with paying shipping. A total waste.
1.0,"While the design is nice, the quality isn't great.  It's very small and the straps are tight.  I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it except for someone very small or a child."
1.0,Demasiado pequeño pide dos tallas más desepcionante esto dinero perdido
1.0,My daughter only got to try these on once and fit great! But I washed them the first time and they shrunk up two sizes too small!
1.0,I never see this kinds  of tishert for my experience  also this is very badddd!!!! Too and it's  not quality !!!! I'm not recommend buying this item!!!
1.0,"I've checked the measurements, ordered accordingly (based on their size charts) but it didn't help at all. Laces are way too short. They make shoes fitting too tight. Wasted money."
1.0,Material feels very cheap. This fit bit not nicely. I’m normally a 1-2x and this didn’t look good at all. I’m an Apple shape.
1.0,The material is not comfortable at all with little to no elasticity which makes them tight around the face and neck.
1.0,The little heart in middle was put on backwards and fell off the first day.  Very cheaply made.  Very dissapointed.
1.0,"I was very excited when I received the first three pairs, even bought some for a friend. They didn’t last that long, but for the price, it was ok. I reordered them, and one pair didn’t hold as it’s supposed to, and the other two didn’t last a week. Won’t buy them again"
1.0,"Don't waste your money. They don't stay tied, poorly made and they are currently sitting in my drawer."
1.0,I barely tried this on and knew immediately that I was returning it. It's super unflattering.
1.0,Arrived with the vinyl peeling off.
1.0,I measured my self looked at the graph and doubled check orders a medium. come to find out I'm a L maybe xl I pute the med on had no stretch. The bottom of the top had no elastic in the stitch was tight swim suite need a little stretch this one dose not I'm not a large women in patiete women and this did not fit well. And maternity not at all.
1.0,This dress was hard as a rock.
1.0,Fabric is ugly
1.0,Poor quality and runs very small.
1.0,"These are crap. The fabric is skewed and the bottom of the shirt is uneven. The pant legs are different sizes, 1 side is  2-3 inches longer than the other. Too bad because they looked really cute"
1.0,I really LOVE the way these sunglasses fit but they break so easily!!!!! The arm fell off and I am not able to find the screw.  So I went and bought a repair kit and none of the screws fit.  I highly recommend NOT buying these.  I take good care of my sunglasses and wear them everyday.  These did not last 2 months.
1.0,I thought earrings would be larger as they look on line really wasn't sasftied with product
1.0,"I had to get a refund on these because the quality is just so awful. They seem to look like they have screws on the back but they are painful to put in and make it IMPOSSIBLE to put a hoop in after using. They’re cheap, but don’t even waste your money on them."
1.0,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.<br />After struggling to get the band to slide through my watch. It didn’t seem to fit the watch correctly. When I was taking it off it came undone and broke. This was not user error (can there even be such a thing with a watch band). While this band was inexpensive, I still should have been able to get more than 1 day use out of it.<br />Do not waste your money."
1.0,somewhat small -  bad quality -  cheap looking -  the picture is misleading. sewing looks very untidy - no finish -  no starts at all
1.0,"I ordered a size medium but I received an XL. Not happy with the size I got, its way too big. The material of the hoodie is nice. It's very soft and the material is not too thick and not too thin. But i'm still very unhappy that they sent me the wrong size. This was supposed to be a gift but it has no use now."
1.0,Although the rings for perfectly with my daughters party theme. I didn't get 15 I only got 13. Meaning I was 2 short for the party.
1.0,"Beautiful dress and colors, but the materials are like a cheap tablecloth. It Did not fit me even though I followed the size chart. Honestly not worth the price or time."
1.0,Fits perfect on a baby doll but not for my husband for who i bought it for.
1.0,It’s made cheaply with bad material
1.0,Waste of money. Very cheap and didn’t last long.
1.0,"Very poor quality, will be returning. Warning to all see through."
1.0,yet another no show sock that is so tight and small my toes feel smashed.
1.0,I was excited about this product to come. This is the absolute worse! It doesn't fit at all. I ordered this in a 3x and was sent a 2x/3x. The packaging is labeled the correct size but the actual waist trainer/belt does not fit. I will be returning and getting my money back. Don't waste your time ordering. After all you get what you pay for! 🤦🏾‍♀️
1.0,Looked not so great on
1.0,Didnt include all the teams that it showed in the picture and one could be your favorite nfl team!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😠😠😠

1.0,Shoe washed one time and the entire shoe peeled off
1.0,broke so threw in trash beware you get what u pay for so do not buy if looking for something nice
1.0,And charger not with shoes. Very disappointed
1.0,Nice but too small.  I'm returning it.
1.0,One of the lights are out on the shoes
1.0,Ripped seam within one week.
1.0,I followed the size chart provided and still ended up disappointed. The skirt fits great however just looking at the top I knew it wouldn't fit. I tried it on and got a laugh because it looks like I'm squeezing my size 38I boobs into a medium and not the 4xl I ordered. The company seriously needs to reevaluate the measurements for the top in this set. I'm returning this.
1.0,cheap quality and poorly made
1.0,"Terrible quality, horrible design, not at all what was portrayed on amazon.  It was basically a rag."
1.0,"Cut my skin, and not cute, somehow."
1.0,Horrible fabric and the seller informs incorrectly about fabric. It is made of polyester instead of cottton. Fraud! What i expect from pijama is a comfortable and natural fabric first of all. It is not as it's made of&#34; ruber&#34; material. Very disappointed. Does amazon chech the info about a product before placing it or it's becoming a racing in reaching a max.number of sellers?!
1.0,"Low grade product, decal is vinyl stuck together in wash on cold. Only gave a star due to would not let me post my review!"
1.0,The written description and the photo of the item was not what was sent. As you can see by my photo these are dangle earrings. They were supposed to be post earrings. This will not work for my purpose. I’m very disappointed in the seller and would recommend nobody ever buy anything from them.  I wanted these for a special event and it is just so disappointing to not have them.  If I could give a minus rating I would.
1.0,Please read carefully before purchase
1.0,"I am so disappointed. This costume is so poorly made. Just opened the package and it is already falling apart, the bra is way too small to tie around even a preemie baby, and the beads have scuffs on them. I am amazed by how this product has so many good reviews."
1.0,"Horrible shape, not at all what the picture shows, every time a touch it  10 to 16 sequins fall off, worst quality and fraudulent, totally different from the picture, extremely disappointed"
1.0,One of the cross fell off while I was driving after two days of receiving the package..
1.0,Plastic nose piece came off  after 2 weeks
1.0,Only received one chain and it broke first time I put on bracelet!!!!
1.0,"Fits perfect, but didn’t hold so long until the stitches started to tear. Exactly 30 minutes later after a continuous walk on the treadmill."
1.0,"Do not buy, poor quality"
1.0,Cut wrong
1.0,"This cape was purchased to use in the salon. It was very vibrant colors. However, the neck opening is very small. It would only fit a child or petite woman. Not at all what I was wanting."
1.0,"Bottoms fit perfect. Top was WAY too big. This was VERY strange for me because i have absolutely no ass (therefore, bottoms usually are too big...or they're baggy) and my cup size is D...so i don't often have a problem with loose/saggy material when it comes to tops."
1.0,These glasses were very wide and loose on my head. It’s rare that I find sunglasses that don’t fit. Not sure why they fit so big around the head.
1.0,These boots are advertised/described as waterproof. These boots are not waterproof at all. I wore them while riding my motorcycle when it started to rain and within an hour the boots were 100% soaked.
1.0,Loved it. Not the short time quality.
1.0,These run super small I ordered an xl and they fit my size s daughter perfect.  These have a cheap waist band and fabric.  Save your money
1.0,I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter. She only had it a couple weeks and it was bent out of shape.
1.0,this product must be kids sized
1.0,Returned. Velcro closure improperly sewn.
1.0,The beige color was off it was more pink in tone never wore it because it wasn't cute and looked cheap
1.0,This dress was really short. Not a dress really more like a shirt. In the photo it was about at the knee. On me it's a shirt and I'm only 5 feet 6 inches.
1.0,"I'm bummed because I like the cut of this dress a lot but the fabric is just awful. Remember the multi-colored parachute you used in gym class as a kid? It kinda has the same feel as that. It just looks and feels so, so cheap and I can't see myself wearing this."
1.0,This did not look like the picture. The horn looked more like a penis. We ended up cutting off the horn.
1.0,Cheaper than a ring from a gumball machine. Arrived in pieces.
1.0,"Ordered red but hot more of a wine color, had to improvise as it was meant for my daughters school Christmas show"
1.0,These socks were fine before they were washed. I did not put them in the dryer and they shrunk to 2/3 the original size and will not stay on. Would not recommend.
1.0,the way it is on the body. it should desing the body
1.0,"I dont know what to say , I think its junk , hower my grandaughter ,the one I bought it for is in love with it because it is &#34; so shiney.&#34;"
1.0,Came with a hole in it 🤬
1.0,"These are very cheaply made masks. The edges are not finished...raw material that will fray in no time. There is no pocket to add a filter for any protection, for ornamental use only. It is very lightweight material and not a good value."
1.0,Ordered based on sizes listed and what I got was waaaaaaay off - definitely too small.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,This was not a child size mask. Simply an adult put in a bag that says child....my five year olds face was almost completely covered
1.0,Very cheaply made. Came with an odor. Does not fit or look like picture.
1.0,I returned this.  Did not fit as expected.
1.0,The coloring is not even remotely close to the photo and the small is more like an extra extra large. Definitely be careful of purchasing
1.0,The chain and the dangling piece are connected by a cheap little plastic? The middle part already had a gap when I took it out of the little bag.
1.0,So my problem is it's the wrong shirt. Luckily it's my granddaughter birthday so she will get this one .this was supposed to be a shirt for her big brother.. but I guess we will go look for another 😉
1.0,Fabric was cheap.  Dress was poorly made
1.0,"Back is a knotted mess, not even creative just sloppy mess."
1.0,returned due to size issues -<br />laying flat under arms - item = 13.5&#34; - stretched =16&#34;<br />no way without damage would fit - looked like for a kid!<br />returning for refund
1.0,Very poor quality. There are threads sticking out from all of the seams. I would not recommend
1.0,They open when the key slides and I've dropped two keys already.
1.0,Way too big. I looked like a bug. Could be used for 60s Halloween costume but not for day to day at least imo
1.0,"Every pair I put on ripped. I bought xl for my xl hands. If the did not instantly rip, they ripped within 1 min of use."
1.0,Runs way too big
1.0,Half of my rings came with broken balls and they took way too long to be delivered . Very unsatisfied .
1.0,"The sizing is NOT accurate... I ordered this for my 4 year old and it was way too small. You could see her entire stomach when she raised her arms and the pants were more like capris. The material is very thin, overall the outfit looks cheap. Not satisfied at all with this purchase."
1.0,Well the plastic emblem popped off not even two weeks after I got it. But you get what you pay for I guess. A little super glue did the trick. It's pretty tho
1.0,Suck!
1.0,All three layers of fabric were torn. Very disappointed.
1.0,Ad made pendant much larger then when received. To small for a man. The size of a nickel
1.0,It rusted with in 2 days
1.0,"This was so tight, that my daughter couldn’t get them on her feet. Not worth it!"
1.0,Was very excited when I took the thermal wear out of package. Thermals are very light and felt nice. Was going to order more until I discovered poor stitches and a hole in them.after I put them on for the first time. They fit true to size I ordered large and had extra room.
1.0,"Muy bonito el color es súper atractivo. Sin embargo el sistema de iman.. no es bueno. No brinda seguridad y no cierra Perfecto. El iman va perdiendo su fuerza, decir, siente que deja de estar ajustado en tu muñeca. Y a menudo cuando acercas mucho el reloj a otros metales. Se queda pegado. No lo recomiendo."
1.0,"The cut on these does not leave space for you but, so the hem in the front will rise well above your waist but the back will be lower as there was no allowance for curves in the pattern. I bought them for Zumba, and the do not pass the standing up test, let alone the bend test. Will be returning."
1.0,Poor quality. Fabric is odd.
1.0,Not recommended this order. Very bad for anyone
1.0,Bad purchase I thought it’s a blow up but it actually has a fan that’s suppose to keep it blown up but the fan was too small and couldn’t inflate.
1.0,returned as broke first time worn. Very cheap.
1.0,"I ordered this in every color, and they all are super thin and completely disposable. Upon first wear or wash they will completely shred or rip. Amazon sent a replacement, but I hadn’t worn my replacement green one yet and realize that it is completely ripping all along the chest. Just know what you’re getting into, it’s a piece of junk dress that you wear like once and then it’s useless"
1.0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR A LADY AND IT IS FOR A VERY SMALL GIRL
1.0,This item was missing a stone.
1.0,Yuck
1.0,We could tell this was used. The package was open and the product was yellow and stained in the arm pit area.
1.0,Bracelet snapped into when I attempted to fit it on my wrist.. Must admit it is attractive but not even worth sending it back.  If it can't fit it  to your wrist what good is it?
1.0,Poor quality material. Doesn’t feel good on. Not long enough.
1.0,Very disappointed in the quality.
1.0,Thought I was ordering a sweater but I guess it was only a picture of of a sweater.<br />Advertising very deceptive.<br />when I received the box there was only a picture of a sweater
1.0,Bill was bent and couldn't be repaired.
1.0,Was very disappointed with item I ordered larger size and it was to small very upset. Like the color and style but will not order again
1.0,Really beautiful but runs very very small
1.0,I like the style and the color but the faster hook keeps falling apart
1.0,"After a few weeks, the slippers started to squeak. They are comfortable, but the constant squeak, while you walk, is annoying."
1.0,"Looks cheap and sizing was wrong, too small so I returned."
1.0,"This is my first review after many Amazon purchases. But, I was so disappointed, that I had to share. I paid more for this because it's organic cotton. But, he wore it one time and it came apart at one of the seams near the crotch and now has a hole. It was precious, but the quality was so disappointing."
1.0,Crap!!!
1.0,"Looks nothing like photo. Image is fuzzy, looks out if focus, not sparkley at all. Piece of junk."
1.0,As I was about to put it on for the first time it broke and there is no fixing it.
1.0,"I have been having the toughest time finding a new bra since my old brand stopped making bands that weren't stretchy.  This bra fits- looks decent and feels firm BUT it squeaks! I put it on and was looking in the mirror, then lifting my shoulders and it squeaked! Anytime I moved my shoulders at all, the bra had some bits that must've rubbed and caused squeaking. It was the strangest thing... sorry but I'm not wearing a bra that's louder than me!"
1.0,The band with the face on it is smaller than the others so when you put it on you can not see the face.
1.0,Nunca llego
1.0,This is kids sizes not adult
1.0,"This looks like it is supposed to be a distressed soft sweatshirt. It is not, it is shiny scratchy material. Save your money"
1.0,"LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AND THE MATERIAL IS LIKE MY SHOWER CURTAIN. After I tried it on it's nothing like the picture. It's a gross material and won't be getting one again, once you put it on it's really oddly proportioned... the waist came up to my rib cage and it's so baggy. NOTHING like the picture and will be returning it."
1.0,COMPLETE JUNK dont waste your money all the leaves were half coming off when i received it
1.0,Went to return them and my return window closed yesterday they just broke.
1.0,"The smell coming off this product is unlike anything else. Very strong! I bought my other kids a name brand pair of goggles and they didn’t have this strong smell. Also, they don’t fit kids. I bought them for my 5 year old and even tried them on my 10 year old and they’re way too wide. There are huge gaps regardless of how tight you make the strap."
1.0,The only jewelry I have gotten that is horrible...
1.0,Bought the woman's small for my 12 year old daughter. This was tiny and didn't cover anything on HER. I cannot imagine a real woman wearing this at all.
1.0,"Just received in the mail and put them in the oakleys, problem is that they are just a little smaller so when in the frame they jiggle. Too loose. Just disappointed."
1.0,Don’t fit arms of frames. Not flexible
1.0,glued so poorly that it fell apart 5 minutes after i put it on my cap.
1.0,Came badly wrinkled!
1.0,They fell apart in less than a week.
1.0,"SCAM company from China!  Surprise surprise!  Item not made of materials claimed on Amazon site.  Studied long, and hard before placing this order.  BAD BAD cloth! CHEAP, Too small, naturally.  Fits size 0-2 Asian women.  I ordered an XL.  Do NOT BUY from this company.  These shorts are the SAME all across AMAZON!  Do not pick these shorts, unless you are customary to wearing cheap clothing.  Price  should have been $2.99 from Goodwill IF you shop and like cheap items.  SCAM COMPANY FROM CHINA!"
1.0,This looks like a Halloween costume. Very cheap material.
1.0,The metal buckle broke off before I could even wear the band.
1.0,These didn’t hold my boobs in place at all
1.0,Supposed to be 2X is probably a medium
1.0,Broke the very first day I used it.  What a shame it was cute.
1.0,Too small. Also lime green slip underneath...actually looks like a children's costume skirt. Very disappointed in this.
1.0,"Returned item same day, was completely see through."
1.0,"Watch band is too small. With all of the links in place it is still too small. I have larger wrists, but every other watch I have ever purchased fits with all of the links or minus 1 or 2. This is frustrating because it looked like a nice watch for the money. If you have bigger wrists, just avoid this watch."
1.0,I just received it nearly a month and half after I ordered them. The zebra print was chiffon and see thru and the leopard print.....well it wasnt even leopard print. It was like dark brown circles rotating with dark brown stripes. Looks nothing like the picture. Save your money!
1.0,Don’t even waste your money order a 2XL and it’s fits like a small. Cheap material as well. Sizing off bad vendor
1.0,The belt buckle came broken in the package with corrosion.
1.0,I had to return this as it was impossible to close.  The hinges do not stay straight at all.  Especially if your daith is on the thicker side and does not allow for any play to adjust.  Also the closure is weak and pops open.  This isnt worth the money in my opinion. A shame really because it’s pretty and good titanium.
1.0,Says it is 95% cotton ????? I question that! I received the shirt with a rip all the way across the chest area. It sure does not feel  or look like any COTTON fabric I've ever worn. It got returned. Even if it was not defective I would of returned it because of the fabric.
1.0,I've not even had this 2 months and the pin felt out and bracelet fell right off my wrist.  Cannot find the pin and so it is useless! Very unhappy.
1.0,"I've had this for less than a month and it's already falling apart. The strap is breaking, the butterfly is warped, and the embroidery is coming apart. I'd return it if I could to get my money back, but the return window from when I ordered it is closed. I paid $60 and it feels like maybe a $15 quality bag. I don't expect it to last long, and I'm really sad and disappointed. I feel defeated. I just wanted a cute bag to wear around! It is also very very small inside compared to the outside, but I could have lived with that if it still looked good. But, no, it falling apart looks bad."
1.0,This was prettier in the picture. I  felt that the band was too thin and would cut  into my finger .
1.0,Only keeps accurate time for 6 hours.
1.0,"Nothing like what's pictured. Runs small, much shorter than what's shown. Even the stitching and blue/grey accents at the buttons and side are not as shown.<br /><br />Thin as tissue paper and probably won't last more than a season. Not worth even the low price."
1.0,"Am I the only one wondering why all of the 5 Star Reviews say they purchased Size: 4 (Waist 31.3&#34;, Hip 36.3&#34;) in color Pink? Fishy, no?"
1.0,Awkward shape wool looking hat
1.0,"5x is like a 1x, shipping took 6 weeks very nice dress just way to small, neck is very wide would have to wear something underneath."
1.0,They're not as nice as the photos.
1.0,"The weight bench was exactly what I ordered..... But it was missing a few screws and bolts and the directions were for a completely different weight bench, so far the bench is comfy and supports well, but I feel a little hunched when putting the seat all the way up, I might have to make a new hole slot to fix that unfortunately"
1.0,"This dress was HORRIBLY undersized.  It was extremely too short.  What was supposed to be a maxi dress, hit me mid calf.  I'm 5'9 and this was extremely too small and too short. I'm very unhappy with this purchase."
1.0,"did not care for this. Though the color was gorgeous, it was well too short to be a dress, despite getting it in a size that seemed like it would fit me. I read many of the previous reviews, and search through images, just wasn't right in the end."
1.0,"There was nothing to like about this item, as it broke the first time I used it. It might work for a woman's high heel shoe, but not a Texas boot."
1.0,I was so excited to get this in the mail but when I opened it the panty size is a 3XL size 14 and in the description it says one size fits all. Another thing that pissed me off is the rhinestones in the back were broken. Super cheap quality. For being cheap I guess I shouldn't have expected so much but now I can't return it.
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress but it didn't work out for me. I'm 5'2, 128lbs, muscular built. This dress was too short for me and extremely tight around the chest area. I'm 34C.  I had to return it."
1.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a large even though I'm normal a size 4. I am very disappointed: the material is cheap and sheer, they are about 3 inches above my ankles, it took forever for them to get here, nothing like the picture. They are going in the trash."
1.0,Terribly made.<br />You have to have zero hips or butt in order for this to work. Doesn’t fit for a woman’s body but maybe a man. Sending back.
1.0,If I could have not marked a star I wouldn't have. This was absolute garbage! The sizing was rediculious. 5xl could fit a 10 yr old. It was so cheap..it looked like a 5 yr old made it! This seller should be ashamed to have their name on this product!  Don't waste your time...you will have to go through the hassle of returning it!!!!!!!!
1.0,Looks like it's out of gum ball machine nothing like the picture
1.0,Every single one of the chains break by undoing the packaging or trying to use the clasp.
1.0,Even though this was affordable… the metal loop on the band came bent and the cloth had a couple snags in it upon arrival… I’ve worn it once and a few more snags showed up with minimal activity.  Don’t buy
1.0,"I ordered my normal size and these are way too small. They didn't seem very good quality, especially the soles. I wouldn't be able to recommend"
1.0,"Very, very poor quaulity. I was shocked at how rough the material was. I couldn't recommend the product."
1.0,They are nice looking but they already tarnish before I wore them had to return
1.0,These earrings are so thin and sharp that I can't even put them on or wear it. When you attempt to put them on they almost snap apart. Total disappointment.
1.0,Very low quality. Broke first time I put it on
1.0,"Well, I know that you always get what you pay for! Case with these earrings! Research your diamonds! These are opaque! Not shiny & brilliant. You would do better to get a pair of white Topaz earrings for this same price.<br />What I will say, service was impeccable. I got a lesson on clarity! Which I needed. Sent the earrings back & was refunded with no problems! Service was 5 star!!!!"
1.0,"Very flimsy material and won't do much to protect your glass from drops or hard knocks on a wall, etc.....Overpriced and you get as much protection as placing your glass in a regular gym bag. Worst purchase I've ever made."
1.0,without a FR rating tag visible this is useless
1.0,the fit was not good.  shows all bumps
1.0,Se lo regale a mi hija y no es plata
1.0,"If you have tinted windows, the lenses in the sunglasses create a strange effect.  It almost makes me feel car sick wearing them."
1.0,"This is my third pair in two years. The soles have come apart on every pair. Time to try a different brand, pay a little more, and hope for better quality. Bye Isotoner!"
1.0,i couldn't even button up my pants i order a size up there run to to small that im about too pop
1.0,This was not as expected.  Very cheap and didn't seem even.  I won't wear it.  I got one very similar from another seller (slightly different color) and that one was great!  I'd stay away.
1.0,Too small and returned it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:559957334cedabf933b815bf9b8e70e3]] Cheaply made, the plastic is all scratched up. Doesn’t fit well."
1.0,Used sweats for boating 🛶. Adequate quality
1.0,Too loose (no compression) and doesn’t fit. My shoe size is 6-6 1/2. Had to return unfortunately.
1.0,Product stitching caused item to burst when soaked.
1.0,"For the price, expected quality and quality control.  No pole screw or way to hold pole together. Not useable!! Angry"
1.0,"It was big at the top, and the waistline was lower than I thought, and it didnt sit right. The top was See through. Pretty though."
1.0,I’m going to return it. Just need a label because return is through ups. Not what I expected quality wise.
1.0,I think these are for show. I tested my laser by shining it through the glasses before anything else and the beam went straight through. Then I tried them on and shine my laser around the walls and it was as bright as it was without wearing the glasses so I think they're just a novelty item because I wouldn't trust these to protect my eyes at all.
1.0,Not as pictured you can go buy a cheap Hanes long sleeve and slap a pocket on to it smh material is soft but awful
1.0,Still not waiting for it I only got the medium one
1.0,I loved these earrings but I returned them because one of the little pearls was missing from the center of one of the earrings.  It was laying loose in the bottom of the box.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"Though the number and sizes of the pockets is perfect for my needs, the quality of the zipper is why I am rating it 1 star. The gaps between the zipper teeth is too big so the zipper will not zip properly. It gets stuck, making it quite annoying to use the wallet regularly. If you have too many items and don't need to zip the wallet it, this wallet is for you."
1.0,I have never gotten this item in the mail. as this has happened to me more then once.what up sets me is I pay for these items £ never had gotten then<br />all I want is what I had played for  thank you.
1.0,"I ordered multiple sizes up, and it was still way to small to even try on."
1.0,"These are supposed to be leggings, they're more like tights! They are completely see through and they come with this horrific chemical smell that even after washing has not gone away! WASTE OF MONEY!!"
1.0,They are junk. They do not stay on at all.<br />The seller does not take returns. Absolute crap!
1.0,I got a Large and they still aint fit They were too short and wide 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ Never again
1.0,Way too small would not give me my refund
1.0,Sent it back. Was not at all what was depicted. Made of synthetic material. Not real leather.
1.0,Poor quality and ugly bottom of purse that is not shown on website.
1.0,"Too small, false advertised as &#34;toddler&#34; cap. Tag says infants. Very disappointed...."
1.0,"Looks very cheap.  Some of the seams were already coming loose when I took it out of the package.  Also it doesn't say ""Hallmark"" Christmas movies which I failed to notice when purchasing it."
1.0,Came with chalk still on jacket from sewing I guess. Jacket looked dirty
1.0,Material is garbage.  It is not soft whatsoever but stiff and not breathable.  Returned!
1.0,Too small and you want to charge me shipping to return
1.0,"I needed this on Saturday, and it is now Thursday. I received a BLUE BOWTIE instead of a mask!! I want a refund but I don’t know how to get one. Very disappointed!! DO NOT BUY."
1.0,I never got to try this on because the zipper broke the first time I pulled it! The zipper on the plastic bag it came in lasted longer! It was sewn in so poorly. There were several extra inches of zipper sewn inside the skirt then were exposed for the opening. Just extra long zipper not trimmed specifically to fit the design. All over bad stitching.  Picture was cute. Reality was a disaster.
1.0,"Sorely disappointed in the supposedly ""high end"" product. First of all, the stitching is horrible and the threads were not even clipped. Also, if you are making a mask in dark colors, why put white elastic?? Black elastic is readily available (check Amazon). Highly doubt I will ever look at a Stormy Kromer brand of anything. Cheaply made for the price point."
1.0,These shoes looked very plastic.  Super cheap looking.<br />Do not recommend.
1.0,This is not a sweater it is a T-shirt material and it runs absolutely huge
1.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6, ordered a L<br /><br />It’s a stretch to call this a dress, it’s very short... also super itchy and poorly made. I was doubtful from the start because it came in a vacuum sealed pouch and that usually means the item is going to be creased; this item was no exception, that might come out with washing but I’m not risking it. The seams around the “turtleneck” were also uneven and coming apart."
1.0,"The shirt is constructed from a heavier than expected fabric; although this aspect is not necessarily a problem, it's worth pointing out. It's almost as if it could function as a thermal shirt but in all fairness,, the material itself is very soft and comfortable.<br />Additionally,  the neck opening is noticeably ""wider"" than a regular t-thirt which lends an unusual appearance when wearing it. Again, not really a problem but significant in my opinion. Most importantly, and the reason I can only supply a scathing review, is that it's way to long.  I'm 6'4"" and 195 pounds and it is definitely too long for me.  I ordered a large FYI.  Im not returning it because it's a $20 shirt and I'm certain I can findb an occasional time to wear it.  Like maybe cleaning a chimney.  Needless say, this shirt will not be hanging in the closet. More like in the garage with the other towels I use to chamois the car."
1.0,"My little girl was super excited about her dress. However, the dress is badly made it skirt felt off the 1 time she wore it. It came off the seams with the littles tug. I don’t recommend buying the product."
1.0,Did not work for me.  It seemed to be designed for a man's body and I am a  petite woman.  I had to return it.
1.0,Slippers fit.
1.0,Wide legs. To ankle. Nothing like picture
1.0,Too late to return by the time he wore one. They come much larger than I expected so now just tryung to find somebody to sell them to.
1.0,Top<br />Part was cheaply made - the fold over on upper chests was flimsy- sadly a rwtirn
1.0,Hoping to exchange for a pair that are not bent upon arrival.
1.0,"I ordered these because I really wanted the blue opal for my rook, not even a week of having it in the end broke off. I just shrugged it off and put a different one in, that too didn't last. The ball had came unglued from the screw part completely. As I'm setting at work currently I felt something fall into my shirt.. sure enough i had the jewel covered ball in my helix, that too had came unglued from the screw part. All in all not worth the hassle of dealing with."
1.0,"The earing didn't even go in my ear, it was the perfect sized but when I opened up the package, the pointy part was broken. It was totally cheap metal."
1.0,"Major negative of the product is that it drained my batteries very fast. Eg.,3 batteries only last for about 1 hr. I started with Panasonic batteries and then I used Duracell batteries same result.<br />Will try another bike wheel light.<br />It doesn’t worth the money."
1.0,Didn’t have this ring 2 days before I noticed stones missing. Now I’ve lost 5-6.
1.0,Cute dress the color didn’t work for me
1.0,I know one size fits most doesn't always work.  But this is a neck wrap for running and it is so huge that it was worthless so it was a waste of money.  My only hope is that my mom can be her creative magic on it to make it useable otherwise I just spent my money for nothing.  I would return but it is more hassle than it is worth.  Sorry for the bad review but just wasn't at all what I was hoping or expecting.
1.0,"I am so disappointed in this dress. First of all, it had a booger(?) on it. See picture 1 & 2. It fit funny in the boobs. Almost saggy. I ordered an XL, and am a DDD, it was ill fitting. The band around the waste was just in a weird spot. And see picture 3 to see just how see through this dress is. You can clearly see my dog through it! So sad because I was excited for this purchase."
1.0,The product came in dirty and red. It was just opened and saw the discoloration. Or it does look used. Would not recommend to others.
1.0,"Wayyyy too small. If you are over the age of 10 don't buy. They are very cute but are not for juniors or women. I am 5'7, 140lb ordered a large and they only go to about top of knees."
1.0,"Item turned on once after fully charged, however in less than a day, was broken.  Wouldn't start."
1.0,"Material was junk, and I had to pay shipping which was $11."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:956f3fb10e7a9946ec9c2c5179efceb0]] Broke 20 minutes after arriving at my event. I was so pissed, I planned for this MONTHS in advance, and now I can't even get a refund or replacement.<br />Absolute JUNK!"
1.0,Order never arrived then had to get it reshipped. Was very anti-climatic once it arrived. It is cheap t-shirt material with zippers. Not nearly as cute it appears in the chosen photo with the blonde holding a coffee.
1.0,Horrible.<br />I was super excited for this outfit because my daughters first birthday party theme was “donut grow up.”<br />The skirt was almost to the floor and the word “one” was all the way down in her crotch and was completely covered up when you put the skirt on. It was a complete waste of money and I ended up buying something else for her to wear.
1.0,Cheaply made clips bend easily good for costume  only
1.0,"If you wear a medium, order an extra large.  It fits very snug and does more than hug all the curves!"
1.0,Fell apart within a week!
1.0,Very unhappy...  it was advertised as a long sleeve with a zip neck.  It was not.  It came the right color but as a short sleeved with no neck zipper.  Really was needing it for a trip I’m going on but it’s too late now.  If there was an option for no stars I would choose it!
1.0,I have a very difficult time getting more than a few bills in it. It’s sad
1.0,The product fit fine.  Some of the stitching was weird on the top but it was ok. The seam ripped on the pants within the first 3 hours of wearing them and they were not tight to begin with.
1.0,This product stopped working in less than 2 months!!  And Ivcan’t get a refund :( and we had to purchase our own battery pack for it that cost almost $50!
1.0,"Cheap material, fits large in length and tight around chest."
1.0,Not correct item completely wrong
1.0,Product was not the size described. Suit was way too small
1.0,Not actually waterproof.
1.0,I used these once in the rain and slipped on marble steps and needed 4 stitches in my leg. I will never use them again. The rubber is thin and does not provide traction in the rain.
1.0,If you have a small wrist you will be fine if your wrist is medium to large it will losen up and pop off.
1.0,Love is nonexistent and the band is so thick.
1.0,Didnt last long before an arm broke
1.0,"I bought it because it did not state maternity dress until checkout, so I was a bit confused per the description whether it was maternity or not.  So I went ahead and ordered two dresses, each was a size smaller from each other, way too much room and way too much material.  Even the smallest dress I sent them both back because you could tell they were maternity.  Love the dress, it's colors, the flow and would love to see this not in maternity sizes."
1.0,Crappy boots that stink of low quality material. Heavy and awkward. Not comfortable to walk in nor cute. Super disappointed. Thank Gd for returns
1.0,Cheap material is not stretchable makes balls on the first wash it is ugly it does not fit well
1.0,It doesn’t fits in my Apple Watch and I had to throw it away and material is not good
1.0,"Wow! I didn’t really believe is was that small, but it is!!!!! Normally wear an x-small in every other shirt so I ordered a small, but I’m sending it back. Super soft.  It looks like it will snag very easily or get balls. Just noticed it has a hole too! The waist is tight."
1.0,Returned -size too small and fabric was very poor quality
1.0,lasted about month
1.0,Skirt was extremely small. I even ordered two sizes up. The material was very cheap looking. I threw it in the trash. Not even worth a return.
1.0,There were NO rhinestones on this dress at all.  This description is wrong.  I ordered last minute and received it today for a party.  I am needing to find a different dress because I was searching for a dress specifically with rhinestones.  Im disappointed.  Going back in the mail tomorrow.
1.0,Came in with no bracket to attach to watch
1.0,"Possibly the worst quality shoe I have ever purchased. The item did NOT match the description and the pieces are haphazardly glued together. Glue is coming out at the seems and looks awful. I ordered two of the colors so I could pick which matched a dress best and they have two different brand names, both of which did not match the description. I tried returning multiple times but for some reason wasn't able to. I am very upset about this product and warn others not to take a chance on this horribly manufactured shoe."
1.0,"Too big, and does not stay on the shoulder. Not a practical top at all."
1.0,I wear size 8 in women's. I feel like they were size 8 men's. Sending back
1.0,Smaller and thinner than anticipated. I will be sending it back.
1.0,"This is dress is even prettier in person than the picture, but it is not an adult sized dress.  I read the other reviews and ordered an XL even though I wear a medium.  That did not compensate for the extremely short dress.  This dress might be more appropriate for a child.  I am only 5'2&#34; and the dress barely covered my butt.  Because of the style there was no way for me to wear this &#34;dress&#34; with pants or leggings.  This will be returned."
1.0,"bad fit for me personally,descant quality."
1.0,Model figures only
1.0,"Love the glasses as a back up pair.  However, they arrived with a pungent smell of burnt plastic."
1.0,so small not happy
1.0,"I actually LOVE this necklace, but it keeps breaking.....I'm very sad about that."
1.0,Too small. Zip gets stuck in the cloth lining. Threw it
1.0,It looks and feels awesome. Came quickly. But it ripped in half 30 minutes after receiving. Which was a real bummer for my child whom this was for.
1.0,returned not good fit
1.0,Out of the package it looks good and is made with good material.  But to say this fits like 18-20 is a crock of shit 😒..... i wear 18-20 bc I have ddd in the upstairs region( if u know what I mean) . It fits more like a 12-14 or<br /> 14-16 I received it yesterday I returned it today. I am very disappointed  because I thought I had finally found a bathing suit that would make me comfortable and have the support I need for my girls. This is not a good product
1.0,I received the item and not only did it run very small but they didn't finish sewing it:(
1.0,This wasn't made well. I wouldn't buy again
1.0,Disappointed 😞
1.0,Do not buy these! Bought them since i have an mri coming up and the jewel fell out in 3 days. Not worth it
1.0,Rag
1.0,This shirt came in and it was hot pink not a dusty rose like pictured I returned it
1.0,I ask for a XS and I get a XL seriously this it absolutely intolerance
1.0,"Fabric of this mask is comfortable and feels durable. The one star review is for the fact that I wore the mask three times to work before the ear strap started to come unattached from the mask, very disappointing!"
1.0,"Cute purse,But cheaply made broke after second time using it.Took forever since it was shipped from China Never again."
1.0,"These things are horrible! Stiff, scratchy and terribly ill fitting. The foot portion was too long and the socks are too long. Worse still, after an extreme struggle to get them on, they slid down and folded themselves over in places. This caused them to embed themselves into my flesh. There was compression but it was odd. I wound up with dents, creases and odd swellings in my legs and feet. I had to take them off to get relief. But they didn't want to come off. Thought I would have to call someone to cut me out of the danged things."
1.0,"These seemed to be what i was looking for, but the quality was pretty poor. Found a hole in one the first time i put it on my granddaughter. Sewed it up, washed it once and found ANOTHER hole. Not pleased."
1.0,"The chain was different from one pictured here, as a result pendand didn't  slide along, but got stuck,  plus there are signs on the chain that it was  repaired before, clamp doesn't work properly, pendand doesn't look as attractive as in picture. Even for $22 with change it wasn't good deal. Sent it back for a refund within 5 minutes of opening."
1.0,Horrible quality don’t waste your money
1.0,Extremely see through in white
1.0,It looks like something you would buy at the dollar store.  I'll give it to<br />a little girl.
1.0,bsd Quality
1.0,i got a scratched stone
1.0,"I'm afraid I'm not even going to bother with a pro and con like I normally do. the photos speak for themselves.<br /><br />I'm sending them back asap. Sorry Revant, not even willing to try again."
1.0,"I gave these one star for the design.  At the end of the day, people want socks they can wear.  I bought these for my wife at the beginning of March, and both pairs have holes already.  While &#34;cute&#34; is a factor, quality is always more practical.  I am surprised since HotSox products are typically good quality, but I guess we got the defect.  How ironic that I found these in the trash on St. Patty's Day..."
1.0,This is beautiful and appears sturdy. However after 1 1/2 months (just past the return period) the rod disconnected from jewel piece. It doesn’t screw in and glue doesn’t hold it long. If it were soldered better this would be a perfect piece.
1.0,I am returning them. Very cloudy and the posts arrived bent. Not happy at all and definitely not giving them to my wife for Christmas.
1.0,Bust extremely small
1.0,Do not try to bend! Breaks easily. Can't shape to ear.
1.0,"This is not like other ""puffer"" coats I've bought from Amazon or other retailers.  It is WAY too bulky, large in volume and especially feels much too heavy in weight.  The fiber fill is the same that's in a sleeping bag and it feels like a sleeping bag. I looked like the ""Michelin Man"" wearing it.  It might be good for a person living in extreme cold."
1.0,dislike flimsey
1.0,"This shirt is not an untucked shirt…way too long for that. Was nice look and feel, but the shirt came down to my mid thigh. Size chart said length was 30 3/4 and upon measuring the shirt myself, the length was 35 inches long. Very disappointed!"
1.0,Cheap quality just like the price!
1.0,"half didn't work or were almost dead... Only like 35 in the package, which was poorly packaged and open..."
1.0,"Purchased a large, it is about the size of a medium.  purchased military green, it showed up in gray.  I was under the impression that it was a sweatshirt, its a long sleeve t-shirt.  will be returning this item.  do not purchase, quality is cheap."
1.0,Broke after 2 usage
1.0,These suck ass why sell something you can't use
1.0,"for kids, not for men"
1.0,"Very small. I bought it for my bf, and it doesn't fit me, and I have a small, peanut head."
1.0,"great functional use but I'm worried it will fall apart quickly as the material looks cheap and reminds me of the foam sheets kids use in elementary school art projects<br /><br />update: it's been a few months and it is falling apart, which is really dumb because I keep it in my backpack all the time and only use it to store my drivers license and ID card for school"
1.0,NOT worth the money and going back.  Material is cheap so is the work.  Work is getting tangle that u constantly have to pull apart.  Not happy with the product.  Save the hassle of return by not ordering in first place.
1.0,bought this band and does not come with watch link removal tool ans spring bar as described don't buy from this seller
1.0,"Inspiring  message and the stainless steel coin was un scratched, however the small ring attachment on the coin that attaches to the coin and then the key ring was  not durable and the coin fell off the key ring the first day I placed it. I didn’t see the coin fall, so it was nice for one day. Seller needs to place a better attachment!"
1.0,"These are definitely China sized.  I ordered according to the waist/length on their size chart. I couldn't get them up past my mid-butt. As far as I could get them on the bottom seam was slready above my ankle. They would have fit like capris, not boot cut jeans. The seller returned 2/3 of what I paid."
1.0,Trash
1.0,This necklace broke within 10 minutes of wearing it for the first time.
1.0,Horrible! The leggings are super cute. I was able to wear it only once and it ripped. I thought it was a one off I ordered another pair and the same thing happened. I’m so disappointed.
1.0,Used it for myself. Just the right size and the stay put tabs on the inside. Very happy.....
1.0,"These lenses are multifocal lenses (there is a LINE separating the regular lens and the magnification part of the lens).  The line separating the transition hurts my eyes and makes reading and every day wear uncomfortable (I bought the  low 1.25 magnification).  The frames are nice, but the lenses are a no-go for me (AND THEY ARE NON-RETURNABLE... should have read more before making this purchase)."
1.0,It had a hole on the side seam
1.0,Very poor quality! Sharp on stitches end . Do not recommend.
1.0,These are poor quality and waste of money. I did not even wear it and the fabric around breathing valve started to separate. All I did was hand wash it gently & air dry.<br />Don’t waste your money
1.0,the apple is adorable.............. when i recieved the necklace it was broken. i got another one. that was broken too. such a shame for such a cute necklace
1.0,"Anyone with a muscular calf will have problems with the fit, too tight in the calf :("
1.0,"I got the XS and it fit like a large. Style is great, but the sizing is WAY off."
1.0,"First off I ordered the blue but my top was a seafoam green color. I really wanted the blue but the color they sent did not look bad on me so I decided to look past that. 2nd it was really cute on until I wore it for a hour and the straps just kept stretching out until the top of my bra was showing. So now that I've worn it I'm stuck with it. Maybe I'll find a cute bralette to wear under it or something. If it had adjustable straps I could have solved the problem easily, but it doesn't."
1.0,Charms fell off. Disappointed
1.0,I’ve been trying to find slippers that don’t stretch out. I thought since these were Supposedly made of leather that I had found what I needed. They stretched out in a couple of days.
1.0,Came in a bag (crushed) and reformed with perma cracks. Too small for a 23 inch head (considered a standard Large by the amazon men's hat sizing chart). Good for kids but recommend something else for adults.
1.0,"Very poor quality for its price, faded thin, & loose will not recommend buying this product to anyone"
1.0,"Terrible quality, everything fell apart after I wore it once"
1.0,"Bought for a gift, read the reviews saying they run a little small. Ordered a 32F looks more like a 30C"
1.0,Hoops wouldn't even open. Had to return the item.
1.0,"Size run different, also the stretch is not strong enough."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:461d52de040291daa73fa9c3ff05418d]] Let me start with the happy part. I initially bought these in pink and I really love them. Got a bunch of compliments, so I was like ""Let me buy another!"" It was quite exciting at the time.<br /><br />Well after weeks of waiting I got the second pair. And you guessed it, they were broken.<br /><br />The screw in the nose piece was loose. So I went ahead a got my eyeglass screw driver and to tighten the loose screw. Welp, it didn't work. Took it to an eyeglass store and they couldn't fix it, unless I paid some money.<br /><br />Soooooo, I wanted to return them or get a full refund. They fall apart. I can't wear them. The logical way to proceed.<br /><br />Well, this vendor is quite stingy. To give you a full refund you have to send videos, pics, keep on explaining WHY you want this refund.  This vendor complains returning them is ""too expensive"" and now wants to give me a only 5 percent refund because they are Scrooge. Told me to just wear them for photos, because wtf. Im not an instagram model..or I could wear them for a photo shoot and have the screen completely come undone and I just rock half of the sunglasses. This vendor could be on to something.<br /><br />Anywho, if you want to purchase these sunglasses just know it will be hell on earth to get a full refund from this vendor if you get a broken pair. Its infuriating."
1.0,"Not a good fit. If you try to pull them up to where they should be on your waist, they basically give you a huge wedgie and ride up into your crack (not a good feeling!) The waist is tight but the rest was huge and puffy. The waist might have been ok if they went up to where they are supposed to be. They looked ridiculous. The pockets are not in a good spot at all. Overall they are a bad cut and not a good buy. They dont look like the picture at all."
1.0,"Nada parecido a la fotografia , mala inversión😕"
1.0,"Not as advertised. Accuracy is not 0.01g. Did not come with 2, 50-gram calibration weights as stated. It was a single 100g weight and a &#34;5g&#34; weight that specifically says it is NOT a calibration weight, because it is hand made (what's the point then). Scale says it comes pre-calibrated, but cal weight showed 100.08g. Measured a coin for which I know the exact weight. It was off by 0.06g on about a 30g weight. No idea if cal weight is off or the scale is off, but I tried to calibrate it anyway.  You can ONLY calibrate it with 100g weight. Obviously, the 100g weight showed exactly 100g then, but the coin still showed a 0.06g error. This is very poor performance for a scale that claims 0.01g accuracy."
1.0,I ordered this set for my Halloween costume and I was excited then they came in today and opened it and it was a necklace not earrings...like what?
1.0,Toooooo tight
1.0,The red color is beautiful. I wear a 9 and ordered a 9.5 and it is to short. My toe is rubbing the top of the shoe. I requested a refund and to return the shoes. The seller wants me to pay $19.99 shipping to return them. So  I decided not to return them. I will not order these again. Then a few days later I get a refund for $1.10. This was not customer friendly.
1.0,THe first time I washed it the lace on the bottom turned to fuzz!!  The texture of the material completely changed from soft silky to rough and scratchy basically it is an item to use and throw away when it’s dirty or just use as a rag..
1.0,"Very different from the ones I already had.  These are very short, they stretch out and ride up.  Also rip very easily."
1.0,"Glasses did not darken at all,stayed clear even looking at the sun."
1.0,"fit my 7yr.old granddaughter, wasted money"
1.0,I returned item. Too small.
1.0,These gloves are like paper and are of absolute poor quality. Tried them on once and realized these things were about to fall apart. I threw them right in the garbage; where they belong. I was highly upset.
1.0,put them in the trash after 4 weeks
1.0,The tip doesn’t stay together.
1.0,"Cute, but post that attaches to front isn't very sturdy. Broke after I wore them the second time."
1.0,"Bruce Smith was 78. Not 76, and not 16"
1.0,Cool glasses but this is the second pair that the lens coating has peeled on. It wrinkles up and just falls off
1.0,"The jacket is incorrectly sized, smaller than what the sizing chart states. It also doesn’t have the same cut as the pictured jacket. Don’t reccomend buying."
1.0,Its ok for wearing sometimes it is cheap but its nice you just have to be careful with it
1.0,Discussting..low quality
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE-<br /><br />Product did not work, the cut to fit into the band is not deep enough. It is a piece of garbage and not worth the money."
1.0,Bracelet is cute but too small for my wrist. Cannot wear.
1.0,Thus is nothing like the photo! It has short sleeves!!!!! I only wish I could return it.  What a joke.  Change your picture to reflect what you’re actually selling!
1.0,"Hardly any of the rings were my size (7-8), and quality wasn't great. Pretty thick for knuckle rings for me personally."
1.0,I experienced itchiness and irritation within 24 hrs before my ear started to get pussy.  I can only wear sterling silver and gold.
1.0,One wash and the graphic faded. Totally bummed cause it's a hilarious shirt.
1.0,These rings are very small I gAve them to my 5 year old daughter .
1.0,This purse has a strong unpleasant oder. It smelled like it had been sitting somewhere collecting mildew. I sent it back!
1.0,"I ordered a 5xl because a like my coats a bit baggy. This jacket, it's not a coat, barely fit. I wear a 2 or 3xl so it should've fit great. I was VERY disappointed when it arrived, and late at that. I would not recommend to anyone!"
1.0,They broke in two weeks
1.0,"Nothing wrong with the seller as the shipping was fine and came in like Prime should. The lenses on the other hand are another story.<br />Considering the price I figured I would &#34;take one for the team&#34; and order them since I lost a lens out of my Half Jacket 2.0's.<br />I immediately noticed these are about half the thickness of Oakley lenses so don't go thinking they will protect your eyes anything like actual Oakley lenses.<br />The other problem and most notable which is what I afraid of, is the vision. Oakley has a nack of making very good quality lenses when it comes to curved surfaces IE: no distortion in visibility, these however do NOT.<br />I put them on and went to take the dog for a walk outside and started to get a headache within the first 2 mins of wearing them as they feel like you are wearing some bad prescription glasses.<br />These are not worth even the low price of replacement. If you spent the money on Oakely's do yourself a favor and spend the money for actual replacements."
1.0,Silly and cheap
1.0,Too small and short
1.0,"They came with a hole in the crotch, poorly sewn, and one of the metal rings where the draw string goes in fell of right out of the package. That said, they are warm and well fitting, snugs up to your bum nicely. I just wish there was some quality control before shipping."
1.0,I'm in the process of returning them. They smelled so bad.
1.0,"I would have been happy with these, but they arrived with a hole in the glove and I need them tomorrow so a replacement set wouldn't help. Bummer."
1.0,Too small. Returned it.
1.0,"While I love the pattern on this skirt, unfortunately I have to return it as it is extremely short and completely see through. There isn't a liner, and the material is very thin. I am typically a size 8/medium, and I ordered a large to be safe. At 5' 10"", this skirt was wayyyyyyy too short for my height. I would be careful if you are tall! Still, it is really cute and I'm sad I can't wear it!"
1.0,"i have bought several versions of these. none of these knock offs work with a polar a370. literally, the watch snaps itself out of the band as soon as you fasten it to your wrist. i am angry at polar for not making the bands anymore."
1.0,I bought this as I need to switch to a maternity ring and my belly button became very red and irritated and swollen. I've had my belly button pierced for 14 years and never had an issue until using this. This is also my 3rd pregnancy and never had an issue with any other pregnancy belly button ring. They also don't make it so you can cut it to the proper length that works for you.
1.0,The silicon grip does not work. They don't say on for more than 30 seconds.
1.0,The product picture on amazon clearly shows that the skirt is connected just under the bust and comes to a point. The dress I got just barely had a curve. No point. Had it had the point it would have looked great. Without the point it was too far up my bust and just looked odd. Very disappointed.
1.0,"VERY tight across the chest and under the arms. And this is my normal size, so I’m very disappointed. 🙁"
1.0,I would give less than 1 if I could. I bought 2 of these. One was for my son and one for my husband to carry their diabetic supplies. The insides are all pulled apart and the straps are broken on both. Total waste of money.
1.0,Was definitely not a 34 waist. Very disappointed in garment.
1.0,"NOT AS PICTURED.  Machine knitted from cheap, thin yarn, glue on plastic eyes and lace for teeth! SHIPPING cost is NOT refundable!"
1.0,Not high impact support.
1.0,This is the worst quality T-shirt. It came and like any other T shirt we put in the washer. The writing got stuck to itself and it ripped off the writing when I pulled it apart. It isn’t a fancy blouse so it seems like it can go in the wash. After it got all messed up I looked at instruction and it says wash separately (check) dry clean only recommended. Really dry clean a tee shirt? So unless you like dry cleaning your normal clothes I can’t recommend. Also the color isn’t the pretty color displayed on the screen. It is an awful orange looks more like a parking cone
1.0,Extremely disappointed. The earrings feel like toy earrings and the swirl actually makes them look very cheap. I put them in my granddaughter's play dress up bag as I won't wear them.
1.0,"The plaid material on this garment is flimsy, only dyed on one side, and looks very cheap. I returned the piece on the same day it arrived. Very unattractive."
1.0,these are the cheap knock off can't charge watch when not plugged in
1.0,"Super small, glasses are for kids"
1.0,Broke immediatly!
1.0,This runs way to small! Beware of sizes!!
1.0,I'm returning this because it's not was advertised it looks cheap it's just crap
1.0,I wear a size 12 and these were too small. Need an XL size
1.0,"This thing is not at all as pictured.  The globe is as big around as a nickle, and the &#34;dandelion seeds&#34; inside it looked nothing like dandelion seeds.  I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"Ordered a ring to say “I am enough” for someone very close to me with mental illness. Get the ring, outside packaging says “I am enough” open up the ring and it says “be brave”. Great now I’m telling someone with a mental illness to mask themselves and “be brave” and not tell them they are enough with who they are? This is NOT what I ordered, thank you for making Christmas a little bit more difficult this year."
1.0,The dress is very pretty but the seams are uneven and the top is loose.
1.0,The ball did not screw off!! Ruined the earrings trying to get it off! Terrible product!!
1.0,Frame cracked above both lenses in in less than 3 months.
1.0,"I received this item before the expected time which is good but when I open it the plastic wrapper inside was tore( I even took picture of it)and also it looked used already, I even showed it to my husband with disappointment! It looked secondhand but I still like it anyway my baby just looked really cute with it."
1.0,Has writing on the lense which obstructs the view. Terrible because it blocks view. Don’t but these unless you want to look through text.
1.0,"These very very poorly made and very skimpy.<br />They don’t fit, they would not fit a ten year old. If I trie drop out then on, they would certainly rip."
1.0,The sizing is wrong a 44 is more like a 39
1.0,very small and look real cheap
1.0,I don't think this is even worth one star. Horrible. Cheap. Look nothing like the photo. The wire doesn't go throughout the entire ear so the tips flop over. If I didn't have to pay return shipping I would return. These are going in the trash.
1.0,"Runs very small, don’t like the way the tie fits on the front it lays bad."
1.0,"I LOVED these at first! Perfect size, super comfortable and soft. After wearing only twice, the seams are coming apart on the butt. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Looks super cute, terrible quality. Day 2 and the wires are bending and plastic is ripping. Plastic is essentially the same thickness as a sandwich bag. So disappointing."
1.0,Ok really annoyed how this dress was nothing like the photo. It’s cheap looking and the print got cut off On the neckline of one of them. Material is thicker and polyester feeling not thin and flowy.<br />The inside is WHITE which makes it look even cheaper and the “brown” is actually orange. Horrible!
1.0,"While waiting for my order to arrive I happened to come across an identical set sold at Wal-Mart for $3.88 - I looked at it and was so happy I'd ordered this one thinking the quality was going to be superior. Unfortunately, once my order arrived disappointment hit HARD. This product is in no way worth $10.99.  Bunny Ears measure 9 1/2"" tall and have very thin wire going up 5"" inside causing them to flop over instead of stand up. Bow Tie - 4"" Bow Tie ties on with a 1/2"" organza ribbon. Cotton Ball Tail has a 2"" elastic loop meant to (I'm assuming) loop over a belt loop or a belt?  For this price the Bunny Ears should be a much better quality with the metal wire going all the way up to the top of the ears and the wire not so thin. The bow tie is described in one area of the description as ""Large pink sparkly Bowtie"" - nothing large or sparkly about this bow tie."
1.0,"This dress is nothing like the picture. I have learned to always order larger, and this dress was 20 sizes too small. The material seems as if it were put together by a 3 year old."
1.0,First band did not snap in place so I got a refund. Second band snapped into place then fell off my husband's wrist. I got another refund but this was a waste of time. Cheap product.
1.0,I’m not sure who really writes the reviews on this but it’s not like it’s shows on the picture you will be dissatisfied
1.0,I bought these because the color indicated red.  These are the same old brown of every other plastic shoe tree out there.
1.0,"Turtleneck is  likely all spandex, or majority  spandex with about 3% cotton. Runs small. XL fit like a M. Nothing as described. Returned."
1.0,Very small bravely and I have small wrists!  It did not fit at all.  The magnet seems to be cheap quality as well
1.0,I have order the watch band under different names three times and none of them fit.
1.0,I recently brought this shirt for my boyfriend and was very dissatisfy and not pleased at all. I purchase a XL which did not fit. I would recommend that you buy two size larger with this manufacturer. My boyfriend wears a XL in shirt.
1.0,Doesnt stick or does any justice
1.0,This may fit a 5 year old. Entirely too small for a petite adult.
1.0,These faceshield masks combination were very uncomfortable. The faceshield part is plastic and hard to breathe through.
1.0,Really disappointed with this dress :( looks nothing like the dress in the description. Very unflattering on my body. The only plus is that it has pockets and the material is kind of thick.
1.0,They do not keep out smoke. Gaps around edges. I wrote a previous review that was similar. Now not posted? Interesting to say the least.  Don't buy for smoke.
1.0,"This shopping bag WAS NOT made in Hungary and was not nearly as pretty as shown in the picture! It will cost TWICE as much as I paid for it, in order to return it to China, where it was made. I am an extremely dissatisfied customer! SAD!"
1.0,Runs very small.  Bought a 5xl hoping it would be bigger since he normally wears a 3xl.  Was much smaller.
1.0,"The slit is incorrect! Thick, soft, and it will keep you warm! Decent price, but not the same thing as the other Amazon vendor ($179). It works, and I received a lot of compliments. So either you purchase the Benz or settle for a KIA."
1.0,"Very disappointed, they were missing eyes and noises, the pieces were not in the bag so they were missing before being packaged. Will not buy again."
1.0,"The colors aren’t what the picture shows at all. Also, the material is weird and cheap. I’m a little bummed."
1.0,Received this costume and it didn’t even come with the blow up machine that makes the costume.  Description didn’t even say it was missing.  Quality control fail!
1.0,I received a dark blue ring instead of a light blue ring.
1.0,Looks nothing like picture. Looks like a thick throw blanket.
1.0,Too small ! 😤
1.0,"Nice lightweight waterproof rain jacket by Staraxy . Great to keep in the car for roadside emergencies that always seem to happen when the weather is nasty. This jacket has a hood and two pockets on the front. Above those pockets are approximately 1 1/2"" high protective strips. On the back, from one shoulder to the next is another reflective strip approximately 2"" high. Staraxy had a great Concept to design the jacket but fell short in delivery. If a jacket is being designed for protection in the case it may be dark, why would you make the coat black? Why not the traditional rain jacket yellow with orange reflective strips? The worst color anyone can wear at night and especially during nasty weather is black. I believe a run to the fabric store is called for. My cart is going to have some different neon stickers and patches. It's a shame Staraxy didn't go through the thoughtful process a little while longer or more in depth. I gave it one star for it being waterproof."
1.0,Product was poorly stitched. It was a gift for friend. The dress she received was awful. Would not recommend.
1.0,Wrong size and color
1.0,I’m typically a small in cycling gear and these were way to big and see through.
1.0,"This runs very small. I ordered a small & medium based on reviews, but the medium was very tight. I would order a size up."
1.0,I love it but I only got the top?????
1.0,I bought this for my sister's 21st birthday.  It fits my 2 year old wrist. Do not recommend to buy.
1.0,Inspect your item closely. After washing I noticed damage around the front neckline and too late to return.
1.0,It's a low end crepe like yuck material. It has weird white polyester odd lining like in a little kids crappy Easter dress from Kmart. Sometimes these Chinese cheapos on Amazon are worth it. I definitely wouldn't recommend it.
1.0,"Cheap, will be returning. Took the earring back off and the pearl fell off the stud."
1.0,My order was clearly placed in somebody else's front doorstep now I have to go and ask the manager to repay the cameras. I'm so upset this was my friend's birthday present
1.0,Clings to your body and not flattering.  I would have returned it if I didn't immediately leave on vacation.
1.0,"For what these are they are fine. Throw some credit cards and cash in them and your good go. However, they each had a made in China sticker on them. Not that that would automatically be a bad thing, but the company describes themselves as making ""American made products"". $15.99 for two plastic made in China credit card holders seems a bit steep, but they work nonetheless. Just don't like their misleading company description."
1.0,This is a silk like material with the gold printed pattern. I ordered the extra large. Thought I'd try it on even though it looked small out of the bag. Way too small. Had much trouble getting it off. This is extra-large for a child.<br />The material felt cheap and and the printed pattern was tacky. Definite NOT recommend
1.0,These socks are not easy to get on or off.
1.0,The latch was broken when it arrived
1.0,The shirt I received looks nothing like the photo or description.  Buyer Beware.  Shirt is awful in person.
1.0,Not sure about water resistance but good fit...great price. Just what he wanted. Doesnt stay ticking....even if you wind it like the instruments
1.0,"Wish I could leave zero stars. First, it took 3 months before the top came in. I emailed the seller twice with no response.<br />I bought a size large which is my normal size. The shirt LITERALLY falls off. The quality sucks. Doesn't look like the picture. Tossing in he garbage"
1.0,"I wanted thin headbands so I could wear them everyday.  When I got these I thought I had accidentally ordered childrens headbands.  When I tried them on I had to force them around my head, and I have a normal sized head.  It says in the description that they are up to 28&#34; stretch.  That is 23&#34; and that is super tight!  Great for little girls."
1.0,This is a counterfeit item
1.0,It was too thick and not green I did not like it not very happy with it. I Don’t even wear it<br />☹️
1.0,Very cheap. The “mirror” material starts to rub off after a few weeks. Even though they are kept immaculately safe when handling. Just a cheap piece of junk. Spend a few dollars more on something easily better.
1.0,The color was not as red as shown. More of a brick red. The fabric looked inexpensive.
1.0,Not worth for $30
1.0,"Open package, and first thing, to test the reel retraction, I pulled on the light weight string,  and it immediately got jammed..."
1.0,Do not buy this product.  It broke the first time I used it!
1.0,Sizing runs too small !<br />I ordered an 11 but got 10 1/2<br />Very disappointed<br />Should have ordered a 12
1.0,Was way too small on me
1.0,"Length was more like a shirt, not a dress. Had to return."
1.0,I washed these before using them and every single bow fell off of the cap. Cheaply made. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Trash shoes
1.0,Not true to size. Getting it on was hard for granddaughter to narrow
1.0,"This was a strange fit. The waistline is really high, and the skirt is oversized. The threading was also loose and unraveling in a couple places. For the price, I didn’t have super high expectations, but I do expect it to be sewn together still  when it’s brand new. I tried it on once, and it promptly went back into the bag for return."
1.0,I'm so disappointed!  The style is so beautiful (5 stars) but the quality of the silver plating is so poor it has already worn off in less than 2 months -
1.0,Description doesn't match product
1.0,Wrong size but ill find a use for them
1.0,"This product really looks very nice in the picture, but its flimsy when you get from mail. I returned it around first week of July by mail postage provided. Until now I don't have refund. What's going on?"
1.0,Bad fit and cheaply made. Sent back for refund. Also extreamly short.
1.0,Does not perform well. Look elsewhere.
1.0,I returned this because it was WAAY too small. If possible go up a size or two from what the size chart says.
1.0,"The sunglasses arrived, they looked good and worked well. Unfortunately, BOTH ends snapped off in less than 48 hours. DEFINITELY worth five dollars. Do not buy unless you only need them for a day."
1.0,Arrived with the tag cut out of the neckline. Not new... It is very oversized and much more see through than pictured. Will be returned.
1.0,La descripción de este artículo dice que son 27 piezas y solo recibí 20
1.0,"Broke in two weeks! I'm so over these cheap sunglasses on Amazon - must have bought 10 pairs at this point, should have just bought one decent designer one!"
1.0,Too loose and big .. product size bought was small but it was huge<br />It can’t be returned when it was bought as a prime product because seller closed the return option for products
1.0,Three of the six pairs stitching started coming apart after two washes.  The fit was good.  I actually should’ve ordered a size smaller.
1.0,Returned this horribly mis-sized pj's.  Bottoms WAY too big and top WAY too small.
1.0,dissapointing
1.0,Liked the cord but I can barely get the clasp to release so I can get it on and off
1.0,it fit but was cheaply made and made my body shape uneven as if I had a defective one
1.0,I received these in the mail last night  via UPS at 9 PM within five hours time at the pool
1.0,"Material was too thin, too small for the size."
1.0,"Love the belt, just what my husband was looking for. He was so excited to get it in his Xmas stocking and it has already broke. The clasp broke and we r unable to fix. Pretty disappointing that it didn't last 3 mos,"
1.0,"Unless you want a laugh don’t buy-it doesn’t say on of a kind, it says one of a kino lol still cute and funny for price so I kept it but you’ve been warned"
1.0,The glasses cracked in half the second time I put them on. Would have been nice package if they lasted.
1.0,This is not wt I order to short different fabrics  hate it
1.0,"While this is what I ordered, it's not what I received. It looks as if they sent the Foster style glasses which have arms that are too short (except for perhaps a child), the frame has no curvature to fit your face and is so small the arms are in tension while wearing (and I don't have a large head). Beyond that they are just cheap looking plastic frames of unknown durability."
1.0,But do NOT stay up on the leg.  We will donate them to the Red Cross.
1.0,Defective upon arrival!!
1.0,"For a XL, this did not even come close to fitting."
1.0,"This dress looks NOTHING like the photo. It only has one ruffle and it's so tight around the bottom of the ruffle that you can't lift you arms. I'm 5'8&#34;, 140lbs (very fit) - I bought a large and literally couldn't lift my arms in it. Very strange. Not worth wasting your time ordering"
1.0,Not excited about this. My first use I tried to reposition on me but as soon as you remove them. They don’t stick back on.
1.0,Utterly disappointing product.  The pearls were tiny and of very poor quality.
1.0,Broke right away in about 2 weeks but was definitely beautiful
1.0,"Made very poorly. Looks so cheap. Didn’t have an address to mail it back, so had no choice but to keep it. I will never be able to wear it."
1.0,"This leopard scarf is NOT SILK as the description indicates in several areas. It is 100% POLYESTER. It is described as a “Leopard Silk Scarf”, “made of high density silk”, “best quality silk processing”. The scarf has a tag attached to it that reads 100% POLYESTER."
1.0,Very thin.  It was covered in a weird dust and had strings hanging from it everywhere.
1.0,A medium fits like an XS. I'm a solid medium and a size 8 but this dress was very tight. Plus you won't get a full refund. The took 10.00 back plus $4.21 to ship back. I wouldn't get it for those reasons. If you are an xs it's nice and great quality.
1.0,"They are not soft and flexible like it says i had to basically blow my ears out to get them in, even with using a lubricant. And they are very light almost see through"
1.0,"Something went wrong. This pair of slippers is not suitable for wearing. The left slipper is wider than the right slipper. The stitching in the toe area of the left slipper does not include the insole lining so the lining is already coming out along the toe area. The left slipper falls off which is a problem.  Insole: not seersucker pattern and not ""Deerskin suede"", but is cotton solid color. Sole: ""Deerskin suede"". Pro: Size 7.5-8 right slipper fits great and is soft. I would not recommend these slippers unless there is better quality control or one wants only one useable slipper with no guarantees it will be the right slipper."
1.0,"I selected &#34;large&#34; (11-12) when for this product I should have selected &#34;largest&#34; 13-14.  The slipper is just too short. Your toes jam into the<br />slipper leaving one's heal exposed by at least a half-inch.  Too short.  If you buy... select the next largest size than you normally wear or<br />you will be disappointed.  Otherwise, the slipper is warm and cozy but short on proper fit... go larger."
1.0,Not as shown  it's not usa size
1.0,don't get it - was way too short - was trying to make a shorter dress longer.  don't get the point of it if it's not coming down to the knee or lower.  sent it back
1.0,"I bought this for my wife and This thing is absolutely giant. This is a women's small supposedly and when it arrived I instantly knew there's no chance this is going to fit my wife. I'm 5'9 and 230 lb and I was able to fit into the shirt. My my wife would be swimming in this who's 5'3 and 110 lb.<br /><br />Also sizing is completely not consistent across the companies products line. I also bought another one of the companies other shirts, also in a small,  which I have laid on top of this product for comparison on the picture. There's two to three inches on each side. Kinda ridiculous."
1.0,"Ordered a 3x, fits my size medium daughter-in-law"
1.0,"I've had alot of pocket watches & this watch is a total piece of crap.  Its like 99 cent Halloween costume watch from Walmart! Doesn't keep the correct time, flimsy material, comes with a NECKLACE chain (who wears a POCKET watch around their neck???), total crap."
1.0,Junky. Gave it to my daughter.
1.0,Do not fit ordered my size and it look like a small
1.0,This is a women's jacket not a Men's as listed. False advertising is not a good way to do business or promote your company. I dislike returning items because of the hassle and cost. Gave it to my daughter although it was a big fit on her.
1.0,Bought a pair for both of my daughters. They were completely unwearable by the 2nd and 3rd week. They LITERALLY were falling apart. Not on just one shoe or one pair but all 4 shoes.
1.0,"Purchased ""Style B Silver"" and received something similar but not one of the selections shown.  Thought it was most likely a simple mistake by the shipping department and at only $5, not worth the trouble to return it.  My wife really wanted the correct pendant so ordered another.  And, once again, received the incorrect pendant.  Perhaps those who want something other than Style B Silver will be OK, but highly suggest you stay away from this particular style-color."
1.0,It failed on the second use.
1.0,very low quality!!!...
1.0,Coat was not stitched when it arrived. It was just a piece of fabric
1.0,I bought this because the reviews were pretty good. I feel like I am the victim of a bait and switch. This jumper was terrible! The material is similar to the kind cheap Halloween costumes are made of. Nobody wears this stuff on purpose. I question the validity and sanity of anyone who gave this thing a positive review.
1.0,"I ordered a large and it was way too big, super unflattering and very long."
1.0,I was disappointed in the size.  I would like to return for refund; do not know proper procedure. It is a very nice bracelet for a child.  Sizes needs to be displayed.
1.0,Poor quality control. Yarn was unraveled upon removing from package. I Would not recommend this.
1.0,I’m hoping I just got a bad batch but many are scratched. I needed them all so very disappointed.
1.0,Tips fell off in the package. Poor quality.
1.0,Does anyone measure these? I took the posts off and just put them around my own jewelry. But.. I'm apparently gonna have to customized this because I dont know whose nose this is supposed to be for. Unfortunately when I ordered this there was no reviews. Now there is and we both have the same problem. Time to break out the jewelry making kit.
1.0,"the material is cheap, the fit is bad. It does not look as pictured the material is more this in the back and pulls on like a swimmers shoe"
1.0,"Answer: When it comes to sandals, almost anything.  These rubbed my instep raw, my toes catch on the toe box, and the heel pads seem misaligned.  Even at the sale price of 29.95 (there is a reason they are so cheap), a waste of money.  Bummer.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a slightly used pair?"
1.0,"I could tell before I even opened the package that it sucked. The material is so thin, it is see through. You can see your private parts right through it. This is not a swimsuit, it cant even be used as pajamas. There is no crotch liner, no support. There is no support or padding in the top. You can literally see EVERYTHING through the suit. You could never wear it in public. It DOES NOT look like it does in the picture. There is no way her big breasts fit into that top, with that type of lift. I am small chested, ordered a large top and my breasts hung out of the bottom. Customer service is terrible, bartering for a refund that is yet to be resolved. Very disappointed in the product and the seller."
1.0,These don’t have a long enough piece of Velcro to tighten to your foot.  They run wide.  They’re too loose on my feet and slip off when I walk.  The arch support wasn’t very noticeable either.  I returned these.
1.0,The material of this shirt is like spandex and the color is a little strange looking under the pattern. I have a larger bust and placement of the image didn’t look right at all
1.0,"These where so bad, I couldn't use them... not once.  It says one size fits all, and I have a size 9 foot, not overly huge, but this was probably made for a size 5 or smaller!  I just stuck my toes in and heated them up, which nearly burned them!  After the very first day, the backs of the slippers frayed and I had to throw them away out of concern for a fire hazard... DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,All the printing was upside down
1.0,"Wrong color!! They are supposed to be all dark purple, but they have white edges and elastics"
1.0,had to return the buckle to amazon. as the tip of the prong which holds it in the belt fell off. Kinda sad because I really like how it looked. Sadly I'm not going to reorder as I think it's a quality issue.
1.0,Agree with the other reviewer. There is no tie. It’s just a small hole in the middle crating the fabric to bulge. I ordered a medium and could have fit into a small. Will be returning. Fabric was soft so would have been a nice romper had it not been falsely advertised.

( WHAT THE HECK IS PRIME?!?! )  I FINLLY GOT THIS MASK AND IT'S A LIGHT BABY POWDER BLUE AND WHITE BANDAGE ON A PAIL FLESHY SKIN (VERY CHEAPLY MADE!! ) DON'T WAIST YOU MONEY!!!!!!"
1.0,The underwear look vaguely like the pictures but the back is super different from what was shown. They also run small and fit weird. If you have a generous rear end these will not work.  So disappointing.
1.0,Broken buttons
1.0,"The colors are dull, short tie & scratchy."
1.0,The straps are literally like 10” too long. It’s useless without being re-sewn
1.0,"These are tight fitting sweatpants if that's your thing it kinda defeats the purpose of sweatpants to me....way too tight 4 me not comfortable at all...their made of quality material,s but who cares if they don't fit like sweatpants should"
1.0,broke almost immediately and changed colors after being on the beach and in the pool
1.0,Horrible cheap quality tarnished by just wearing .
1.0,"Advertised as clipons. Very disappointed, since they were supposed to be my 6 year old girls birthday present."
1.0,This dress doesn't fit to size. You must order 2 to 3 sizes bigger than your actual size.
1.0,Cute but not long enough to be considered a nightgown.
1.0,These capris virtually disintegrated the first time I wore them.
1.0,Very cheaply made. The whole tie came unglued and fell apart.
1.0,My daughter received this for Christmas and has worn it for two days and it has already ripped and is coming apart. Please don’t waste your money on this. I went with this band over a similar one due to the price but I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"I Like that it was checkerboard, which matches the 50's theme party I'm throwing next month. But did not like how the dress looked or fitted once I tried it on."
1.0,Poor instruction. Could not get it attached to my watch so I returned it.
1.0,"Had my first trip planned in a few weeks since I bought this bag. Upon filling it, the main bottom zipper split. Unfortunately I am outside my 30 day return window."
1.0,These pants are not measured in US sizes despite that size chart....
1.0,Súper grande
1.0,"I wear a large or size 14 in everything.  I ordered an XL in this jacket for layering and it was about 2 sizes to small for me.  I couldn't even get it on.  It is a cute jacket and looks well made but watch the sizing.  Due to the sizing, I had to give it a 1 star."
1.0,"Like others who have received this product, the UV light doesn't work and the item is non-functional without it. Look elsewhere"
1.0,"I will never buy clothes off Amazon again. So far my experience they're all made in China. Fyi the fabric is 35% cotton 65% polyester,  typical stretchy,  shows every bump and curve . Cleaning label says to dry clean. I went ahead and hand washed it and hung dry and it was very wrinkly would have to iron to wear. There was a hole in the pocket that I would have to sew. Will just give to goodwill..."
1.0,"it arrived that it was not even working.<br />Too hard to open the clip, I broke my nail doing it.<br />Details quality and materials were looking poorly.<br />Returned it to the vendor right away, it's a very cheap watch and it's not worth the cost."
1.0,One of the heart necklaces came apart right away. Cheap material
1.0,"BAD BUY from China's &#34;Wang Gang!&#34;  No return info included.  Since it was &#34;imported,&#34; I'd ordered a size larger than I usually wear, but it was w-a-y TOO SMALL, anyway!  I couldn't fit my arms into the sleeves, and ultimately  gave it to a friend with a congenital disease that has left her with a big belly and skinny arms!  Meanwhile, I found a similar blouse on the Sears website, sold by K-Mart, marketed as a Jaclyn Smith top.  Bought it. Great fit.  Great price.  Pic included.  Check it out,"
1.0,"I wanted a spiritual bracelet for my husband made without any metal. But this one began unraveling at the tied ends, as soon as the prayer was said, and the bracelet was tightened.  I haven't yet figured out how to re-tie it yet, in a way that it won't unravel again."
1.0,"This was a horrible dress.  It does not fit the way it is shown in the picture. The material wrinkles constantly and is way too thin. When you tie the dress together (wrap style), the front is so open that you have to wear a cami. But, it looks extremely awkward with a cami under it due to the style. Super cheap. Do not buy."
1.0,"When I got the product they looked good, but upon further inspection and actually wearing them there are a lot of problems with them. I looked at them and they looked like they fit but when I tried them on they were way to small in all the wrong places if you get my drift and in the back they were way too big! Like they really are unproportionate all the way around. I feel like I wasted my money to be honest. So if I were you I'd really do your research with these!!"
1.0,It doesn't look like the picture...had to get it alter
1.0,Horrible and cheaply made.
1.0,"May work for reading glasses or a very thin frame like aviators, but cannot get the tips of these over anything with normal thickness (wayfarers, etc.).<br /><br />Added to that inconvenience, the Ukes store sent me the wrong item TWICE as part of my recent attempt to order. Disorganized service, and a product not usable as described."

1.0,I ordered a XXL and the shirt I received looked like a small I couldn't get one arm in
1.0,Late and very cheap quality for not  cheap price. Dont buy
1.0,Horrible! Please don’t waste your money. You might as well be wearing a Kleenex tissue on you face.
1.0,Was not what I ordered. The clasp is a standard little open and shut clasp when i ordered the one that pulled together that is easy for me to see. Disappointed
1.0,Dont like the random writing inscriptured onto the shoe.
1.0,Not very good!!!!
1.0,It fits great like a oversized sweatshirt but it doesn’t go off the shoulder and that’s why I ordered it I wear a med but got a large and it still doesn’t go off the shoulder really disappointed
1.0,"Size was way off, runs big and poor quality"
1.0,The strap was broken on the purple sloth set when i received it. The rest of the outfits were great.
1.0,"these shoes are supposed to be a size 12, fits more like a 2. very disappointed as they even list a size chart and its not true to size either way you go. Not pleased at all"
1.0,Product did not fit to size . Will be returning
1.0,"Love the pattern and the material, but the 18 to 24 months shrunk down to be the same size as a Cat and Jack 6 to 9 months long sleeve shirt after washing. I'm very annoyed that my son never got to wear it because it's too small. I won't be purchasing from this brand again."
1.0,The earrings broke the third day I wore down
1.0,"These earrings are NOT GREEN.  They are very comfortable & the shape is just right, but I wanted green earrings.  These are a dark silver."
1.0,I wear med or large so I got a med and it’s huge!!! And the quality feels terrible. Itchy and just looks cheap
1.0,DONT WASH IT! It does not hold up well when washed.

1.0,Its sheer. Like it would have been great but its see through and cheap
1.0,"False advertisement, not polarized"
1.0,"fits weird not as expected at all, returned"
1.0,My Daughter wore them for three days around the house seams along the bottom and the side have broke away from the fabric. Definitely it not worth buying.

1.0,This product was a waste of my money. All the purse hooks have fallen off
1.0,"Cute costume, but runs very small."
1.0,"If you have elementary school aged children, fine, but this is NOT for adults.  Returns at your expense.  Garbage transaction.  Emails from seller in bad english.  Stay away from this vendor."
1.0,Not worth at all cheap quality
1.0,"Not happy AT ALL.  The strap tore when I was trying to put it on!  Then the clasp jammed when I tried to remove it.  I was not rough with it putting it together, but i did have to break the connector to get it off my watch!  I didn't even get to use it once."
1.0,"Sizes are way off, I ordered a XL and it was like child sizes"
1.0,"Product is not durable, worn out after using it a couple of times - expected it to last a few months."
1.0,Went with the recommendations for my size and it was still too small up top. Little to no coverage.
1.0,"Very thin/ low quality product, but the price is good. Unfortunately the stitching fell apart after the first use.<br />Do not recommend to anyone even at the price."
1.0,Unfortunately I received a very tarnished copper colored necklace...
1.0,Very thin see threw fabric. Way too small. I bought XL and received item marked XL but it is a Small at best
1.0,Very disappointed in this dress. I took it out of the package and it was all wrinkled and then I realized there were stains on the armpits as if someone had already worn it. I am sending it back.
1.0,Es muy bonito pero lo compré en talla grande lo hicieron muy abajo del pecho
1.0,Very disappointed in the quality and the shape of the hat.  It was shipped to me in a large brown envelope. It was flat as a pancake with lots of wrinkles. Don’t waste your money. It’s not worth $5.00. The hat in the picture doesn’t look like the hat I paid $15.00 for.
1.0,Fit was not good
1.0,"I liked the small size but it is NOT leather. I feel tricked by them saying PU Leather. Here’s what that means: PU (Poly) Synthetic Leather is a man made material that will represent the look and feel of Genuine Leather but in fact is NOT. This PU material is far less durable, considerably cheaper in cost, and may not last long if used often."
1.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up after reading reviews on the sizing. I normally wear an M and I ordered an XL. This costume STILL didn't fit me. I am 5' and 135lbs, I could barely get my arms through the dress. Also, the cape was made for a child, it fit around my neck but was basically a miniature cape. My husband and I got a good laugh at this costume. I returned it but even the quality just isn't worth it. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Disappointed.  Thin material.  Sized way too small.  Not worthy of Gildan label.
1.0,runs very small have to send back
1.0,The pants are a wonderful fit however the top is a crop top and not long enough.  Will keep because of pants.  Very dissatisfied with top and no mention it is a crop top
1.0,"These are very cute, but are so cheap quality I feel like they aren't going to last long. The black part of the material is kind of rough and uncomfortable. They're extremely thin to the point that they're basically see-through. I would not recommend spending your money on these."
1.0,Size does not follow the size chart provided. Tights were wayyyyy too small
1.0,The straps of the bra comes out every now and then! Does not fit though the size is correct!
1.0,Very unflattering. Looks nothing like the photo and cheap material.
1.0,"I ordered these as a gift. I am sending them back. First they come in a plastic bag; which is tacky. Second, they look like they are made of plastic. The concept is cute but they look cheap. I wouldn't recommend them."
1.0,I have a few types of these pants but from different brands and this brand is disappointing! The waist band rolls whether or not I'm wearing them. It's like it's not sewn properly. I'd recommend trying another brand. I have a few different ones and this one is the only one that does this!
1.0,The opening is too small for my small kid to get his face out .. Didn't like it.
1.0,The watch didn't work . I immediately returned it and I still haven't received my refund.
1.0,The product looks nothing like this depiction. It is paper thin and very cheap. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,Dress came with glue on it.  Not happy
1.0,"I was looking for something smaller that could be worn with more than 1 necklace, so this was too large."
1.0,If you have larger feet (size 11) - these will be very very tight.  The calves are also very narrow.
1.0,"The dress is not worth the money.  The material is cheap, the neckline is way too low. Don't waste your money"
1.0,"I didn't get what I ordered, not even for the pine I chose for it to fit. All waterproof cases I have used are junk for the s8. Makes me completely bypass any that says waterproof even with new cases"
1.0,The pearl part fell off of the rest of the earring
1.0,"I buy tops from Amazon all the time (and love them) but this is going back. I’m 5’7” 175lb w broad shoulders and I’m busty. I ordered an XL. THIIS shirt hung terribly, was poorly made and the fabric is very thin. Save your $."
1.0,Print is kind of cheesy
1.0,The earings are really cute BUT I pretty much had to rebuild both right out of the package. All glued parts were loose or had fallen off completely. One of the red beads for the nose was missing.
1.0,"Ugly, ugly color....nothing like described or pictured. Looked cheap and ugly, could not wait to return it and get my money back."
1.0,Roll up. Doesn't  go down to my hips.
1.0,"I think I can fix them, but yes they fell apart immediately"
1.0,"I always try to look at the positive side but these are a huge disappointment. The description says full mask. Well, no mask arrived but the “ gloves” did. And those are short green faux fur gloves that really don’t resemble Grinch hands other that the color. My husband was so looking forward to being a grinch but for now, he can’t even get his hands in the green mitts. Unfortunately, this is a big NO for me"
1.0,Extremely poor quality. Fabric separated in the back for no reason.
1.0,"I never reviewed anything, this product deserves it.<br />It's really a piece of s....<br />Bad quality all over."
1.0,"Thin, cheaply made, absolutely zero cotton content. Completely misleading product description.  :("
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Cheap material. Looks like Chinese children sewed it. Don't buy it.
1.0,👎👎👎
1.0,"Not sure if the is was a knock off or just the wrong Travis Mathew polo…material felt right, but the picture clearly shows a polo with no striping, what I received had an embroidered stripe across the chest.  Ordered an XL, fits like a XXL.  I have 3 other Travis Mathew polos in XL that all fit the same, not like this one. Will be returning."
1.0,I had this band for two months and it broke at the connection site because the screws popped out. Definitely cheaply made
1.0,"Not quality material thin And not soft or comfortable. Straps are not adjustable. Buttons are not functional. This cheaply made in China dress is maybe worth $5. Also im 5'8"" and 135 and large still felt snug so if I had to get it again, I'd get XL because they shrink in the wash. I just can't believe people are being charge $28 for these dresses."
1.0,Item broke the very first time I tried to use it. What is the foam held on with glue stick glue it doesn't hold at all.
1.0,"did not receive it, got bra clips?"
1.0,Fits weird. Loose on the sides to the point you could see my milk makers.
1.0,The pants are very thin and not comfortable. Also sent them back over 8 days ago and still waiting for my refund. I have bought through Amazon for years never had problem with refund until dealing with this vendor. Don’t buy if you have questions about fit.
1.0,Very cheaply made . Doesn’t look anything like the picture. Please refund me . I threw in garbage. Zero stars
1.0,Very thin cheap fabric
1.0,To big looks great on pictures in real life its jist normal nothing excited i gave mine away i was not please
1.0,The dress was nice fitting except the color! It was not this plum purple it was an ugly purple
1.0,These boots are absolute crap. They appear to good enough for south Florida winters. If you drag your feet more than once you scrape the bottom off. NOT RECOMMENDED
1.0,"I have a 5 year old grandson.  He really loves ""Unspeakable"".  So when I saw these outfits I decided to get them for him.  I ordered and XS it is way to big.  It would probably fit a 7 or 8 year old.  He and I are very disappointed."
1.0,Way too small!! Made for a child!!
1.0,"Looks nice.  Stone color wasn't as shiny as picture, they were dull.  But mostly the first day my wife wore it stones fell off in the first couple hours of wearing it.  Returned for refund."
1.0,Wrinkles won't come out
1.0,"I was really stoked to try this as an alarm clock but was very reluctant to purchase based on so many of the reviews saying it would stop working or have trouble connecting via bluetooth. Mine worked for about 3 days after it arrived and then completely stopped pairing or turning on. When it worked it was really awesome, woke me up in the morning with a jolt and didnt bother my roommates. I really wish this was a more reliable product."
1.0,Lo recibí y apenas ahora que lo vendo a la clienta lo le sirve y la talla de la falda está bien. Pero el top imperfecto en la parte de la espalda es muy pequeño y se sale el busto por delante. No se pueden levantar las manos
1.0,nothing like the original ones
1.0,It breaks easily. Huge waste of money. Couldnt wear for a week
1.0,I bought the same pair in light gray and they fit perfectly but these ones are to small and the crotch is up super high legs are tight I held them up to the other ones and there a big difference but marked the same size to bad I washed them and they even have a hole in the crotch now crazy price for being cheaply made plus there thin wouldn't recommend them
1.0,It's a beautiful ring. But my wife use it for a week and the paint started to chip.
1.0,The earrings could not even fit inside of my Tragus!
1.0,Very thing i dont like it
1.0,[[VIDEOID:17cb4052404b2170df42131e99f09312]]
1.0,Unless you have the finger size of a baby they're too small. And they're really poorly made.
1.0,"Poor quality. Not as shown. Fabric is NOT COTTON and is completely see through. I was at the post office ready to return it (cause u can't drop off at an Amazon drop only to realize it was international shipping. WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF MONEY. And it has no shape. Total disappointment"
1.0,Unfortunately first day wearing it already the vulcanized sole is pulling away from the shoe. Incredibly disappointed especially since I love vans. Don't expect them to last at all
1.0,slips off the ear very easy not worth the money
1.0,Very poor quality I recieved this one and another one same company just did colors the lighter color tie dye was ok this however was not !! And they weren't that cheap very disappointed as it was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so will be returning..so buyer beware the material is made out of a bathing suit like material
1.0,This is a cheaply made sweater.  I do not recommend ordering this product.
1.0,"Print was supposed to read ""EWW, PEOPLE"".  There was maybe the top of the letter ""E""  That's the only reason it was purchased was for the silly caption."
1.0,"This product wasn’t like the photo at all. Buyer beware. It took a very long time and when it came it was disappointing. It was fishnet material sewn at the edges....except the sleeves, which were unfinished. I was really looking forward to this  Cover up, especially given the great reviews received. I have contacted the seller but given the price I doubt I will get relief."
1.0,Wish I could love it but unfortunately 😔 it was wayyyyyy too small. So if you're 5'7 275 then this is not the one for you.
1.0,"The delicate chiffon material of the dress was badly damaged, in both the front and back. I am extremely dissappointed since I was hoping to wear the dress to an upcoming event. This is total garbage!"
1.0,Runs very small. Tried to return & have not heard from seller.
1.0,"Wig was very small, did not fit child's head, even though I bought adult size.  Color and look was great, but very sad it did not fit :("
1.0,Buyer beware! Piled all over the first time I wore it!<br />Great cut/color/thickness but horrible quality material!!! Don’t waste your money!!!!!! Seriously you’ll regret this purchase
1.0,Omg. I was expecting a cotton mask. And these are sheer. These wouldnt protect against dust much less a microscopic virus like covid. It took over a month to ship and we will never actually use these. They look like underwear. Total waste of money!
1.0,It tarnished within a week. I did not wear in the shower. It’s a dark dingy color. I don’t recommend. I bought this as a gift for me and I regret it.
1.0,"Runs super small and short. Ordered a large and it was like I put on a small. I'm average build, 5'8&#34; and a cup so a large should have fit."
1.0,"After 2 or 3 wears, I see this. They are very much not tight in me so how did this happen? Completely disappointed."
1.0,The material is very child like not like photo it is shimmer black or Halloween costume it was sent customs and smashed customs. I read the custom views and I liked the logo so I guess that’s my issue but this was a gift and not the highlight 😳🤯
1.0,"Disappointed doesn’t even describe how I feel. Not only is it about 2 sizes smaller than it should be, but the color is wildly inaccurate. “Army green” is not a bright green color first of all, but this is about the color of a bright green crayon. I am 5’7” about 138lbs and generally wear a medium. Based on my measurements I ordered a M and even if I ordered a large there’s NO WAY it would’ve fit correctly based on this sizing. I’m getting a refund and recommend nobody buys this with high expectations."
1.0,"No way to securely close and thin material - also, smaller than I realized it would be"
1.0,Runs very very small. I bought a large and it's more like an extra small. Pretty but not worth it.
1.0,"Disliked everything. 4 pc set, 3 different sizrs"
1.0,"can't screw it in, just keeps turning, not worth enough to return, maybe that's what they hope for"
1.0,"Odd design, very ugly."
1.0,Total waste of money. This costume was clearly made for plus size people. If you wanna chance it I'd recommend going 2-3 sizes smaller. Also they make you pay for return shipping!
1.0,I will be returning the T-shirt
1.0,The lenses do no fade like shown in the picture. They are very large on my face. I will be returning. The Lenses also have a purple and green oil looking reflection.
1.0,It looks so cheap with that price.  I bought the one from Jamboree it is only 1/2 price but looks more expensive .  I will return.
1.0,Len's are way too big to be men's locs! I looked like a damn bug! Gave em to my sister
1.0,I washed it in cold water and it still shrunk lengthwise. So it ended up a bit short.
1.0,Nothing like what was advertised do not buy from here suppose to be a cuff got cheap beaded braclets that break as soon as you pull on them
1.0,It’s looks nothing like the picture. Very cheap quality  product
1.0,This dress came torn on the shoulder. The material is very cheap and see through.
1.0,These were pink and then turned completely green after I washed them. I washed them entirely on
1.0,Poor quality. I never tried it on I just sent it back.
1.0,It looked good on the model but not so much on me. But I'm keeping it as a sleep shirt.
1.0,Two bracelets were pulled apart from the clasp when I opened the package. Very cheaply made.<br />Not worth the time or effort to return.
1.0,The only problem with this is it is not actually sterling silver as the description says it is
1.0,It says men but was extremely small like its made for a child! Wouldnt fit my husbands head. Only good thing about ordering this hat is that i have kids so they get to wear it
1.0,Not made for a female anatomy.  No comfort or support.
1.0,I had to throw it away because the hitch pin fell out while I was in a crowed room
1.0,Yet another novelty that can’t even hold up to expectation. Immediately opened and wanted to return. DONT BUY
1.0,And ugly
1.0,"I did not like this dress at all, and returned it. The waistline fell across my bust (strangely) and created a line across my boobs, which was NOT flattering. Also, the fabric felt kind of scratchy and cheap. It was not at all what I was expecting."
1.0,No support at all
1.0,Literally took it off and it fell apart in my hands. Very cheap quality. Do not buy
1.0,"This was crap, I’m so sorry!<br />The teeth were like paper and it came with some puddy that you needed to put in your mouth. Needless to say, I sent it back"
1.0,Fits so weird! Not even enough material to touch both sides together
1.0,"ONLY GAVE IT A STAR, BECAUSE THEY MADE ME!<br />I’m SO disappointed! I can not even begin to explain how much I was looking forward to wearing these.<br />•1st red flag I had been bamboozled was;<br />they are awfully light for being made of natural water buffalo horn. Although, admittedly, I don't know how much water buffalo horn weighs. SO... there's that.<br />•2nd red flag that I had been bamboozled was;<br />when I started to clean them, so I could wear them, my hands became covered in a black residue reminiscent of ink. I'm sure it was sure it's some sort of dye. But no where does it says ""Dyed black""<br />>Side note: It was quite difficult to get off.<br /> •Red flag #3 that I had been bamboozled;<br />as I was drying them off, and with all the godsmack clearing my head, I was looking closer at them. To be honest, I'm not completely convinced they are in fact Water buffalo horn. BUT... either plastic or something else NON•ORGANIC!<br />My final & most irritating red flag 🚩They are TWO DIFFERENT SIZES!!!🤬<br />W. I. T. A. F?!?<br />I mean COME ON! All of the other flummery I could've overlooked. But two different sizes? seriously?<br />UUUUUGGGGG!<br />Just WOW!"
1.0,The item fit really small for size
1.0,I received one last mask then was advertised and two of the ones I received were damaged and one was completely unusable
1.0,These shoes are awful. The design is nice but they are made extremely cheap. Should never be sold for more than $10. The most poorly made shoes I have ever worn!!
1.0,"Was pretty disappointed, I was expecting a nice soft hoodie.  The fabric is a slick nylon type blend.  Not a warm snuggly shirt at all.  Maybe I missed something in the description....  the print is also pretty blurry, again, maybe I missed something.  It’s just not at all what I was looking for."
1.0,funny question? how does it fit. Really amazon?<br />Product is pointless.  Did not stiffen my hat.  Total waste of money
1.0,these ear rings are NOT sterling silver. My ears hurt so bad
1.0,Horrible plastic is stained you can’t even see it’s all foggy and wrinkle the material on the hat is cheap do t gay this product.Its not even worth a Star rating but you have to put something..
1.0,My locksmith cut and programmed the key and I'm glad I only ordered one. It did not start my car. Locksmiths equipment stated it was programmed but it would not start the vehicle at all. Ended up just going thru Dealer. Horrible experience and cannot get refunded what locksmith does so it's a lose lose all the way around.
1.0,"I ordered a small, it fit like an XL! The belt was also missing. The stitching was not great either. It was a waste of money 100%"
1.0,poor quality like paper
1.0,I'm not sure my child will be able to use this because it has such a strong perfum smell to it. As though it was washed at the factory with a highly perfumed product. It's currently soaking in unscented detergent bath to try to get the horrible smell out. This is such a sad situation because most kids that need this shirt (to calm sensory disorders) also have allergies to perfumes and sensitivities to smells this strong.
1.0,MUCH SMALLER THAN ADVERTISED.. Not my cup of tea.. I wouldn't recommend this product if you want your jewelry to be noticed.
1.0,My opinion of this product seems to be a sizing at the labeling & packaging site. Knowing that there's a difference in men and ladies foot size was totally disregarded.
1.0,The GT emblem fell off almost immediately
1.0,"Didn’t like the material. Top was way to tight, I’m not big chested so that was unexpected. Waist and length was fine, but can’t wear it because of the top."
1.0,"I bought an xl in this dress. I can usually bounce around between large and xl. It was a joke when I tried to but this dress on. It didn't come anywhere near closing, like barely around my waist. I looked at the measurements before buying and this was way off. So off it was practically comical. I don't know if the wrong label was attached to the dress or what, but needless to say I returned it."
1.0,"1) Aesthetically the backpack looks great, however materials it's made of are very thin and can rip easily.<br />2) Plastic zippers that broke after very light use.<br />And conveniently for the seller the the return window has closed, so I'm stuck with something that doesn't work!"
1.0,When I put it on I loved it and was going to order another one. But it’s so thin I got a pull in it the first time wearing it and now there is a hole.  So sad.
1.0,Don’t get
1.0,It came with the lining ripped inside.  Was not like the description and not worth the price.
1.0,"These are SHORT/THIN socks. They are probably only 3”-4” above the ankle, if that.  I assumed they’d be “crew” length, but definitely not. So I returned them."
1.0,Way too small. And it took forever for them to arrive.  I honestly forgot I even ordered them<br />Until they showed up.  Not worth it
1.0,"This pajama set was mad for someone with larger hips, longer torso, and larger breast, not someone petite. This set was an xs, but not the xs that I usually wear."
1.0,"I was so disappointed! It took forever to come, it’s see through and not oversized. It looks nothing like the picture DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1.0,"After cutting it due to the instructions, the belt was too short"
1.0,"I wanted to love this jacket, this specific listing. After reading all the negative reviews I bought it just to see if I would get what the majority did.... I got what I was expecting...<br /><br />Highwater Sleeves??? YES!!!<br />Actual lining??? NOPE<br />Awkward sewing job??? YEP<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone buy this jacket. I was incredibly disappointed (as expected). The ""lining"" is just the backside to the plaid printed fabric. It's not a real lining. Think fleece lined fabrics. This jacket just comes out tacky and poorly designed."
1.0,Zipper doesn't work after 7months.  I kept it for 1 1/2 years and now zipper doesn't stay together even after a few tries.  I lose coins all the time.  Time to replace.
1.0,Do not buy....not a good quality....
1.0,They are not Polarized Anti Glare
1.0,clasp is a joke. Can't take three steps without it falling off. It is really really bad. Very pretty but won't stay together
1.0,Not real and fake
1.0,"This is a cheap garment. No finishing stitching on bottom hem so it started to ravel before I even washed it. They couldn’t possibly skimped more on material. I am very short-waisted and a solid Sm/Med, ordered Med and it is tight in the arms and the “waist” before the ruffle is very high. Don’t buy this. Not worth 10 cents"
1.0,"Sadly, I've had a pair of these gloves now and after less than 10 hours of use, the seams are coming undone. Also, the largest glove size barely fits my medium size hand. I would not buy these again."
1.0,Cheap material for the price.
1.0,"Poor quality material, feels cheap and thin."
1.0,Small not in width but in length 🙄
1.0,Not what is described. Not a tutu at all. It is more like a pedal skirt. It is colorful. Definitely more a play skirt for dress up.
1.0,"Beautiful design but impossible to make smaller. I attempted to remove each one of the ""removable links"" and each time the tool broke. I am so sad about this purchase. Hoping it can be remedied."
1.0,"I bought this as a watch to keep track of bus schedules.  I needed it to be reliable.<br /><br />Almost immediately it began showing the wrong time by a huge amount.  It was either gaining or losing time.<br /><br />I could't rely on it so I tossed it out.<br /><br />It may have come with a nearly dead battery, who knows, but I expected the battery to be good when it came.<br /><br />I didn't want to spend the money on a new battery when the watch was brand new.  It just as easly could be a defective watch.<br /><br />To fool with batteries or try to return it was more of a hassle than I was prepared to deal with.<br /><br />Disappointed.<br /><br />Steve"
1.0,Runs really small as do most Chinese products. Just fork over the cash and get one at a store that fits.
1.0,Looks super cheap and poorly made
1.0,"Awesome idea, terrible quality. The fabric is like gauze, is hardly stitched together at all and absolutely snags on eveything  from a jagged fingernail to a necklace. I'm wearing it for the first time today to work and I have a desk job; there is nothing physical about what I do and it's snagged 3 times already!  About the only positive thing I can say about this is the colors are pretty.  The pocket won't hold much weight, definitely not a cellphone.  It'll hold a credit card, couple of bucks and some chapstick, but that's about it.  I'm somewhat crafty so I can fix the snags and will actually cut it to not make it an infinity scarf. Because I can fix it, I won't send it back, but for those expecting a ""travel"" scarf that can hold up to some wear & tear...this isn't it."
1.0,"This looks nice, but it smells terrible. It's so bad that it makes any room that it's in also smell awful. I tried airing it out for several days to no avail. Had to return."
1.0,"Fits but not nicely, not tight on shoulders or arms like it should be"
1.0,These glasses are so cute but one of the arms of the glasses was broken when recieved the package. Might re order because they really are cute.
1.0,"I've had an apple watch for years now and I've never had a band break before. Not only did this one break, but another band just like this broke as well. Sent them both back!"
1.0,Very tight so size up for sure. Material has some give but I would not call it stretchy at all.
1.0,Looks cheap nothing like the picture
1.0,For the price it was ok.
1.0,"Worst product ever, it itches beacause it isn’t 18k gold plated 925, the image isn’t the real ones. When you see the product you notice it isn’t real “ 18k gold plate 925”."
1.0,"Terrible quality. I ordered the plastic post gummy bear earrings and they came with a cheap metal post. Not only that, but they fell off the post when opening.  The ones that weren’t broken it coming apart broke my daughters ears out really bad after only wearing them for an hour. I don’t recommend these for your child AT ALL."
1.0,"Very thin material. Do not buy from this seller, Mirabel Clothing. They make you pay your own return shipping. Even when it's of no fault to yourself."
1.0,"The finish came off the ring within 2 days, I found the item worthless."
1.0,this creates a poor expectation ... doesnt fit sizing is off
1.0,Don't buy it ! Totally disappointed! One earring was totally broken and necklace was broken off from string
1.0,You should state these run extremely short. I bought for a 6-7 and this would fit a 4 to 5 year old. will not pay to send back for it would cost me just as much as I paid for the three dresses.
1.0,The clock loses the paint. Bad quality.<br />Everyone who bought peeled.<br />I am very disappointed with the quality of the product.
1.0,"Original pair arrived with one post broken off, the other bent. Sent back and asked for a replacement. These pics are the replacement earrings. One had back broken off again, the other back is bent and poking thru the packaging. Very disappointed because they are really cute earrings!"
1.0,Not to mention the tips is all holes yould have to wear something undernot
1.0,"These are perfect gloves for the summer. No lining. No padding. Not sure what the purpose is, but they are not to keep hands warm.<br />Pass."
1.0,Did not fit properly. The front drags making you trip as walking.
1.0,Shipping was extremely slow and the gloves are not good quality. Do not recommend.
1.0,Horrible product! Not a sweatshirt! Should have read the reviews! Tag ripped off. Should not allow to sell on Amazon!
1.0,"I have average size hands and have no trouble buying other gloves. These gloves are hard to get on and even harder to get off. A reviewer stated they had some stretch, mine did not. These actually seem like kids gloves. It’s a shame because they are well made."
1.0,The clasp was broken when I received it. I ordered this for my maternity pictures and wasn't even able to use it. Very disappointed
1.0,Decided to go with the polarized lens this time and give them a try. Lasted one day and hated them. Couldn't even look at a phone screen gave a glare will never buy the polarized again.
1.0,I ordered a large since its my size but when i tried it on it fit like a medium and the top was really tight around the lower waist. The material is very thin didnt like it so I requested a refund.
1.0,"This item is not linen as was claimed by the product description. The label clearly states it is 35% polyester, 15% nylon, 50% cotton. There is no nothing linen about it,<br />it feels like thin, plasticky sandpaper. Recently contacted seller requesting a refund."
1.0,"This shirt looks much better in the picture than in actuality.  Not only did it shrink and needs ironed, it had a hole in it."
1.0,"I really liked this bracelet, but it is very cheaply made. Very flimsy material, the magnets come apart real easily, I wore it once and after trying to get the decorative snap out, it broke."
1.0,The dress was so beautiful. Looked exactly like the picture. I absolutely loved it but it was sized extremely small and I had to return it.
1.0,Material is terrible ripped along the seam after first wash
1.0,"This is a really nice looking watch, and I thought it was a great value too.. but this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.. I wore it for less than a month before the minute hand stopped moving and began to spin freely; thus making the watch non-functional. Five stars for Amazon's return process! I will choose another watch.."
1.0,These would be great but it is stretched out at the ankles so it will ride up.  I liked them though so I returned them thinking it was just a defective 2 pairs.  But when I got the replacement they were the same way.  Returning them.
1.0,What a piece of junk!! I bought this for my 10 year old and within one hour the neckline came apart. I assumed it was defective so I returned and exchanged it for a new one. Within two weeks (4 wears) the same thing happened to the new one. I’ll keep it bc I’m not sure they will take back now but needless to say I would NOT recommend.
1.0,"At first, I was excited about receiving this product at its advertised cost which is cheaper than another company on facebook that advertised its cost for around $100.00. I did my thorough research and found the key words ""SHINING MASK APP"" and came across this mask. I purchased one from another over seas company in China and received it in 34 days from the purchase date, tried it out and was not satisfied with it. I disputed the product and returning it back as well. I came across this one on AMAZON which took about a week or less, but cost more and tried it out....it has the same issues as the other one direct from China. The problem is a light strip under the right eye. It looks terrible and needs to be recalled. I would not waste any more money on this product until the whole manufacturer fix the issues with this. I do not recommend this product at this time. Do not waste your money on this product although it may look cool and appealing to buy."
1.0,The frame came crack🙁....really cute but would be better if it was not crack.
1.0,If you select this from the photo as I did you are going to be very disappointed! To say it was cheaply made is an understatement. Sleeves were different lengths. The flaps on the front were weird and stood out. It arrived crumpled in a plastic bag and that is how I sent it back!
1.0,Put teeth in hot water as recommended and the gold came off the teeth-didn't feel safe to wear them after that.
1.0,I certainly received a package. An empty package with one side ripped open.
1.0,"As they always say, 'you get what you pay for'  This watch stopped working on my overseas trip on the 3rd day!!!"
1.0,"There were spots all over it, but I saw them after I washed it. I believe they were there before because I hand washed it in the washer alone with mild soap."
1.0,They came broken. Super annoyed. One of the sides eyewear is chipped
1.0,"We loved these shorts, until the ruffle ripped off after only wearing 2 times! The worst part-the return window had already passed, so now we're stuck with ripped shorts."
1.0,"This cheap metal caused a severe reaction, it can't possibly be made from the material that is listed."
1.0,"These underwear do not last long at all.  The elastic waistband pretty much wears out after only one or two wearings.  I typically don't buy this style of underwear, either, but need to right now.  Otherwise, I would never purchase them."
1.0,Lenses scratch very easy. Not what I was hoping for ! Not anti-scratched lenses and not blue blcking lenses . uncomfortable.
1.0,The size is rediculous this is a 4x in the photos. I have never worn bigger than a 2x shirt 3x hangs off of me but I decided to be safe than sorry. Well I'm still sorry the sizes advertised are beyond false.
1.0,"This item was a very cheap fabric for the price. We could have overlooked that, but it came stained, snagged,  and with a popped seam. Not worth the money or time. Would give it zero stars if I could."
1.0,Don't buy these!
1.0,"Does not lock the end and magnet came out, started to break the joins."
1.0,The heading says the product is cotton.  It is rayon and spandex.  Please change the title of your product.
1.0,These are not sized properly.  An XL is basically a small to medium.  No size chart to go by.  Sewing quality seems ok though.
1.0,"I returned it the pattern not the same as pictured, fit great, love the feel of the material just not the pattern I wanted"
1.0,Too large. Washed it to see if it would shrink a little NOPE and the shirt had a fishy smell material is poor quality. Disappointed
1.0,"I couldn't get these shoes to fit, so they were unhappily returned. Material seemed good, but since they were worn for about 30 seconds I cannot attest to how they feel, other than too tight."
1.0,Did not seem to help.
1.0,Both earrings arrived with the backs broken off. Hopefully the replacement is better
1.0,Ripped literally the first day
1.0,"This purse looked like everything I wanted. I need something sturdy with a lot of pockets. It is a sturdy purse. The material on the outside is tough. It's not an attractive purse but I knew that.  My problem with it, is several of the zippers have broken already... And the material inside the purse is garbage. It started fraying within days.  And all of that frayed material gets caught in the zippers. It also rips in other areas and anything that was separated in the pockets is now in between the lining of the purse and the material. Do not buy this purse. I just wish I could get some refund back because I certainly did not get my money's worth."
1.0,As a Catholicc I am appalled that you will sell an incomplete Rosary how can I pray it when it's missing three decades.  When I order it I had no idea it was incomplete. It doesn't matter that it's silver and pretty because it's useless because it's not a true and complete Rosary. A Rosary is meant for intercetion not for decoration.
1.0,These definitely aren't at all polarized. Dont be fooled.
1.0,"This mask is really flimsy and will not fit any normal sized head.  The material alone looks cheaply made.  The image of the mask makes the character look stiff and not very realistic.  Do not buy, this is not recommended."
1.0,Horrible quality! It’s made with that fabric that sticks to your fingers!  Gives me the eeebie geebies! Not worth the money or wait!
1.0,Were not as long as described and poor quality! If I could I would get a refund. Wash as instructed and shrunk even more. 😟
1.0,"I'm a large man and finding right size shirts has been hard since I gained extra weight. I tried this brand. I didn't see their size dimensions. And didn't realize it was an Asian company which usually is cheap. Which this was. I opened package and I'm like "" are you kidding me""... In American sizes it woukd have to be  at most an xtra large. Sending back. Also extremely thin, almost paper thin and see thru."
1.0,Runs very small. Didn’t like material ....looks cheap
1.0,Very very small!! Ordered xl and can't even think about fitting it! I usually wear large or xl
1.0,I got a hole after wearing them 5 times.
1.0,They are uncomfortable and the plating came off immediately.
1.0,These were not real. I brought them to my sunglasses Hut at international plaza in Tampa Florida
1.0,Looks too much like a Moo Moo. Nice fabric but just overwhelming! Returned ....
1.0,Was not! The same product pictured. I received a womens blouse.
1.0,"At least an inch bigger than standard US sizes, but labeled as such. If I could get past that, there’d still be a bigger problem.The clasps came loose in the bag and some kind of unusable hooks were attached. It was so bizarre. Had to return sadly. Pretty, put poorly put together."
1.0,The fit was horrible.
1.0,"Looks nice, but isn't durable, the chain is broken after one week of wearing"
1.0,"Buyer beware. I receive the this yesterday after being a note and that it was undeliverable the day before. The gold items are of a heavy cast metal and so should not easily pull apart. My necklace came already broken in the packet. (See photo) So it must have been shipped that way. Then to add insult to injury, I cannot return...Not happy. 😠"
1.0,"I can't even rate this.  If this is a linen cotton blend, then I'm crazy!  The fabric is a poor quality, the stitching is also good.  I would not recommend the seller at all, and I generally am a positive person that tries to find something good, but honestly...NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED!  I am DEFINITELY sending them back!"
1.0,"Arrived broken, returned it the day it arrived."
1.0,Hi my glasses came to me broken and I can't return it!
1.0,Lordy.. the arms on this is way too long!!!<br /><br />A person that is over 6'0 would still find the sleeves to be too long and exaggerated.
1.0,Belt has started showing cracks around the belt holes.
1.0,"😠 Fail product, I receive my pant damage, I pay and I refund the pant for damages and they never give my money back.. unsatisfaid, never buy this product Poor quality"
1.0,Very poor quality.  Do not purchase.
1.0,"This sweater is in no way 'off the shoulder""  its way too small at the neckline - not at all what it appears.  And I requested a refund but was denied.  DON'T DO IT!"
1.0,"Wish I could rate it 0 stars cause it's nothing like advertised wouldn't give me a refund either shirt is made for a new born baby with short arms, basically a crop top with half sleeves, wouldn't recommend it.."
1.0,Doesn't work !!<br />Don' waste you $$$.
1.0,"This was an odd shirt. I'm 5'1 and 113lbs, and it was extremely tight around my armpits, arms, and midsection. The holes on the back were cute. The sleeves were strangely long so they bunched up a lot. I also wouldn't recommend this as a workout shirt, even though that is clearly what it should be, as it was very warm material and the bit that goes on your hands would get real gross real quick."
1.0,disappointed and gave to a child
1.0,"Definitely a child's set, not for ""woman"" as advertised. Very disappointing."
1.0,Material feels uncomfortable on the skin. Itchy material and made too small. The cuffs on this were too constricting. Love the design and concept but the actual item and execution was horrible.
1.0,I ordered my daughters size and they were to tight.  These are from China so they took like a month to come in. Didn’t bother returning.
1.0,"Didn’t fit at all,and felt weird,too hard on my feet"
1.0,Super cute but the first day I wore it my finger turned green. I know it’s only $10 but I’ve had jewelry that lasts longer for about the same price.
1.0,This is not looking cool😔😔😔😔
1.0,"My son fell in love with these when he saw them. They are cute, soft, and very comfortable. But there are holes down the seam in the crotch area.<br /><br />Edit: I added images to show how large the holes are. This one is almost as large as my palm."
1.0,"They were exactly what I wanted. The fit was great. The problem, however, is that the seal between the frame and the lens separated after the first use, making them useless."
1.0,This is very poor material and badly made. Very small and not made to fit any curves (36C)
1.0,"Advertised as 'cotton' ---  actual item list 95% polyester/5% spandex<br />Ordered an XXL ---actual item looked like child pajamas then I found writing on the plastic that read ""China XXL/US 12""<br />Total Disappointment -- On its way back"
1.0,Do not buy won’t stay on and your dog will look at it like bait
1.0,HUGE! even on my super tall adult brother
1.0,"first time I tried to put them on my glasses they popped apart, after a while I was able to get them back together, tried a different approach, popped apart again and gave up"
1.0,They were cheap & i returned.
1.0,Bell bottoms poorly made
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it. It looks lovely but didn't hold up.
1.0,Bought this without thinking because this isn’t my style looking back but it’s a cool statement peace but it is see through
1.0,"Poor material, bad sizing & very bad shipping. This skirt did come with a belt but order a xxl didn't fit at all. Gave to a co- worker who wears a large and was still very snug on her. But this item came from China so I should have known my fault. Took 6weeks to receive the skirt."
1.0,Very large... the pattern was ugly.
1.0,Not good material! Ripped instantly
1.0,Showed up ripped not even at the seam in the center.
1.0,Not as shown....just plain red
1.0,Una porqueria cero estrellas
1.0,I bought the zebra print thinking they would look cute and the black ones. I ended up returning them because they were super see through and didn't seem like the quality would last over time. I am so bummed
1.0,The red in the print is overbearing.  The face looks somewhat distorted.  Went with another maker and returned this one
1.0,"I wear a 9 size shoe and I didn't wear them to the party, they were way big , looked like a white funnel over my shoe."
1.0,"I ordered navy, but they are black. The size was too small also. They seem like nice tights if you order a size too big, and know that the color is not correct."
1.0,"Didn't work at all. The wires were probably at fault. The company is a good one, but the item was the bad apple in the basket."
1.0,It doesn’t look as good as it does in the picture. There were no cut outs on the sides.
1.0,"The outfit was nice, but not what I expected.  It was too small for as the crop top and shorts was too little"
1.0,"So disappointed! I am a 36DD, 5""2 160 lbs so I purchased an XL. This is by no means flowy at all. It is really long, tight all around, and just gives you a square shape body.<br /><br />The color is very vibrant and matches the photo, but I will sadly be returning this."
1.0,"Ring very, very tiny stone very very tiny! Not as described!"
1.0,"The material of this dress is poor quality and the pockets look terrible. Does not hang like the picture, don’t buy it unless you’re extremely thin, tall and have zero curve. I’m 5’2 135 lbs. Does not look good on a petite frame. The neck embellishment is a total joke- sags and hangs awkwardly and does not look ANYTHING like the picture."
1.0,Really cute gave only 1 star because the slip underneath is to short and it's unweable as is.
1.0,Dress is literally shaped like a box and super short! Returned
1.0,not real leather
1.0,"So, here goes.<br /><br />I backed this thing on kickstarter.  The pavlok 2, actually.  And it worked great - the device itself, that is.  Not so much the app, but whatever.<br /><br />Then...nothing.  The faintest of jolts at max stregnth.  Weird.  I contacted customer support, they got me a new one.  Same deal, worked great for a couple weeks....then....nothing.  Nada.<br /><br />That said, I got to wondering what was going on.  I took my Fluke 87 V to it (for the ininitiated: a very good electrical multimeter) and was surprised to find out that the device was still creating a potential of 450vdc across its body.  That should be PLENTY to feel a good shock, even at the dimunitive ampacity this thing is designed for.<br /><br />So something went wrong in engineering here.  I wonder if it's possible that with repeated wear that an unseen layer of oxidized corrosion forms on the surface of the device, loading the contact surface and therefore resisting conduction across the skin, whereas my meter's sharp probes were easily able to puncture that layer?  If that was the case, a good buffing with steel wool could potentially take care of that.<br /><br />I intend to give this a shot on one of mine.  See if that helps things.  But honestly, the reason I want to give this product such a low rating is that it is a prime example of style over function.  The idea came first, then the marketing strategy, and its like the actual engineering work was phoned in.<br /><br />This device is a fantastic idea: but the execution is horrific.  Nobody should pay 150-250 for a device that stops working in 2-3 weeks time."
1.0,These masks are only 2-ply. Not enough for anyone's protection.
1.0,I think the quote is something like you can never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.<br />There’s a sucker born every minute. This is worthless.
1.0,Returned. Small fit
1.0,"Not at all like the picture.  It is not flowy at all.  I'm a size LG/14 and this is too small! However, the material is very soft."
1.0,"Just got this today as a little protection to keep someone from simply walking off with a $700 helmet. Turns out the back of the package says it will not work with ""some"" Shoei helmets. Mine is one of those I suppose. It doesn't say that anywhere in the product description. It would be nice to know since Shoei is one of the most popular helmet manufacturers. The T-bar is too fat to fit through the ratcheting device. I wouldn't use it anyways, I'm no incredible hulk but I just bent and snapped the T-bar by hand. It is made of very cheap aluminum, not steel. I reset combo on the carabiner no problem. Maybe I can still use it with a cable of some sort."
1.0,I thought they looked scary not cute. I am not impressed at all. Certainly not for a 2 year old. They looked so adorable on the ad.
1.0,"I contacted the seller and asked to confirm that these were polarized before I purchased them. Only to receive them and they are NOT! If you have NEVER worn polarized shades then you wouldn't know any better. However, if you HAVE then I assure you these shades are not. Therefore, should not be advertised as such."
1.0,"very pretty and light, BUT.... FRAGILE!!!!!! After the package arrived, I put the frame on, tried to adjust the nose pieces as they were a bit too wide - they broke off. Extremely disappointing"
1.0,Ordered a boys large and received a size 6 shirt that will in no way fit my ten year old.
1.0,"First, this dress is nothing like it's pictured. From the floral pattern to the color of the dress, everything is off. The dress is teal with tacky flowers. The chest area fits loose and does not fit and the dress runs huge. I'm 5' 100 lbs and got an small and it was giant. The fabric felt like tablecloth too. Just don't get it."
1.0,Definitely not what I expected. To small and doesn’t even look like the picture.
1.0,Lining separated after just a few uses.
1.0,"Utter garbage. Poorly molded figure. Chain nothing like it appears in picture. Picture and description show a snake chain, you get a cheap, thin, extremely weak loop chain that seems exactly like the type of chain you get out of a gumball machine. Seriously.<br /><br />Would not recommend anyone buy this for anyone else, unless you really hate that person, and have to buy them a gift, and don't really care if that gift show them that you hate them.<br /><br />This was an embarrassing piece of jewelry. Thankfully I was able to return it. I just hope the seller didn't make a cent from my purchase."
1.0,"I rarely write bad reviews but I couldnt let this one go.I took them out of the box and saw that the frame was crooked.When I tried to softly straighten it out,it broke in half!Didnt even get to put them on,what a waste of $13,but you get what you pay for and learn from your mistakes!"
1.0,It was not near the color you have posted here it a lighter color . This picture clearly shows it no to be deep burgundy
1.0,I ordered a small and received a xxl so I can’t properly say how much I may have liked these pants which makes me sad because I was excited for them. They are lightweight and seemingly durable
1.0,"I got a 1x and I'm 5'6"" these come down past my knee caps. The black material isn't bad but the printed material is really scratchy around your waist, and the waist is a tighter fit while the legs fit much looser. I wasn't at all satisfied with them and requested a refund which I did receive."
1.0,"Too small, very poor quality"
1.0,Very short and not high wasted like in photo. It says free return with prime and it is not.
1.0,"This is without question the worst hat I've ever purchased in my life. When it got even slightly wet, the blue stain flowed out like crazy and stained everything! It even stained the fiberglass on a boat! Using a magic eraser could only remove some of the stain"
1.0,"Product looked OK but ordered a Men's size M. They sent an XXL. Sent it back, reordered a M, they sent an XXL again.  Don't have time to try again."
1.0,poor fir and poor quality
1.0,cheaply made honestly really cheaply made upon 1st used the ring that hooks everything broke off good thing it wasnt that pricey i DONT RECOMMEND IT
1.0,Horrible leggings! I bought them for both myself & a friend with a totally different body type - and we both hate these leggings. They don’t fit & the material is NOT soft. I threw mine away.
1.0,Broken when the first time use.
1.0,Sorry I purchased it - bought the medium in light blue - color turned out to be very dark - had tried xs in the past and it didn’t work hoped medium would be a better choice it wasn’t it was huge - the sizes of the company are screwy - don’t buy
1.0,Very cheap. I returned them.
1.0,The pole bent and broke.  Not sturdy enough.
1.0,"First of all, not shoes! The glasses were fine but A LOT bigger around then what I thought. Sorry I bought them. Had to go to Goodwill last minute to find ones that worked."
1.0,I ordered a woman's XL and they look like they are a child's XL or woman's small.  Can't even wear them at all.  Waste of money.
1.0,The chains immediately started to come off while i was wearing it.
1.0,"This is the second band replacement that I have bought from this vendor for the Fitbit Surge. The first one fit perfectly and lasted 15 months, the same as the original. The newest replacement will not even fit onto the clasp side. The injection molding seems defective. I will order from another vendor."
1.0,Terrible cheap material
1.0,"material very cheap, very see-through and scratchy.  wish the waistband was wider."
1.0,"I dont like it at all, it wont stay on it keep coming off my fingers."
1.0,Broke in ~3 weeks.
1.0,Awful dress stitches show threads everywhere smelled like gas wont buy again
1.0,"I received this on time however, it was in pieces with my instructions on how to use it so it worthless to me"
1.0,"Buttons are OK, Packaged fine, but I order Assortment #1, but they sent Assortment#2,  I wanted the buttons in Assortment #1, that's why I ordered them.<br />that is why the 1 star,"
1.0,"I ordered a size large, which is what I normally wear, and could not even button it.  I looked to see if they sent the wrong size, and there wasn't even a tag on it.  Not sure if that was a defect, or if they are all that way.  I would avoid this one."
1.0,"Chose brown/red color, when I got it in the mail it was really PURPLE. Cheaply made, size ran bigger, and flares out weird when you wear it."
1.0,Awful cheap fabric that makes you look 20 pounds heavier! VER UNFLATTERING!!
1.0,"It's very thin material and obviously arrived extremely wrinkled. Fits weird like a big baggy jumpsuit, nothing at all like the model. I won't buy this product again but I was pleased with another jumpsuit of the same brand so maybe this product was just a flop."
1.0,"I can barely get this over my head.  It chokes me around my neck.  The fabric is doubled up, but it's too thick to breathe through."
1.0,"This was advertised as water proof. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!! As soon as water touched it, it soaked in."
1.0,"Do not recommend this dress. It is SO sheer and does not fit. I have a very slight build (5' 9&#34; 115 lbs.) and was not happy with the fit of the dress. Moreover, there was extra fabric on one of the top pieces so when I wrapped it the fabric just hung there like an extra appendage. I was so happy when I found this dress online and got for a wedding. However, the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and it was just a disappointment"
1.0,"Love this dress! And everything about it except I wish it came in more variety. Five stars<br />EDIT; well I got my wish, they made it in more colors. HOWEVER they changed the pattern! Not the same dress as the original. I've tried it in 2 new colors than last year and they don't even reach my ankles and the waist part  lays just under my bust instead of on the actual waistline. I guess they are cheating out and that extra 3"" of fabric was too expensive...<br />So disappointed now"
1.0,It was all bent and missing jewles from it. I wasn't happy but they made it right by refunding me.
1.0,"If I could, I would not buy this item.  If I could return it, I would, but I waited too long to view this item.  I received it and put it away for a Christmas gift for my daughter, then noticed the incorrect grammar on the dog tag.  The last line should read ""You are loved more than you know"" but it reads ""You are lover more than you know"".  Ridiculous.  AGAIN, PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  I should have known better."
1.0,Within a few weeks the frames broke on two of the glasses.  Cheapest reading glasses we've ever purchased.
1.0,Much larger than expected and EXTREMELY unpractical to close. I couldn’t figure out how to “tie” it to make it look like the seller’s photo and it certainly didn’t come with instructions. I wouldn’t ever use it because it’s so difficult to open and close it. Cheaply made and poor quality.
1.0,Color was not at all as pictured. Terrible color and now only have 2 days to find a dress for wedding
1.0,"It was the worst item I have ever purchased on Amazon!!!! If I could give it 0 Stars, I would have. It,s super cheap, looks like some kid sewed it at home, looked nothing like the photo. Plan on returning this. So, so disappointed.... will never buy from this vendor again, please save your money!"
1.0,I wanted to like this but two major issues:<br />1) The adhesive is extremely cheap and doesn't work at all. The eyebrows and beard would not stay on for more than about three seconds before falling off. Extremely frustrating.<br />2) Way too much shedding. There were white hairs all over my house.
1.0,Material was thin and stiff.  I expected thin as if was described as chiffon but I did not expect it to be stiff :-(<br />The color was also off.  It was described as dark brown.  This was more of a copper color.
1.0,"Still haven’t marked it as received so I can’t return it and it doesn’t fit. Have sent multiple requests. I’m not small chested but unless you you have zeppelins for boobs, this won’t fit"
1.0,"The writing on this is very hard to read.  It looks like it wasn't engraved very deeply into the metal.<br />The metal is darker than shown in the pic. It actually looks really nice,  but because the worrying is barely engraved...it just makes it even harder to read.<br />I bought this as a Christmas gift, but now I'll have to something else this afternoon."
1.0,"Yikes - this suit is so poorly made, it’s astonishing. Within a few hours of being worn, the suit had tears in the seams at multiple places (shoulders, pockets, legs). This was not due to poor fit or wear and tear; this is just a very poorly made garment. It didn’t even make it to Halloween. Will not buy from this brand/Mfc ever again. Buyer beware!"
1.0,Pin that holds the center piece broke in 2 weeks.
1.0,"The shoes runs super big, and came with stains"
1.0,"Ordered an extra large (usually wear large rather have it a little big) it was so small i couldnt even put it on! Other than that it was a georgous coat, wish it would of fit!"
1.0,"Buyer beware!! This is not .925 Sterling Silver, it failed magnet test. Amazon should pull this product for false advertising.<br />I am very disappointed with this seller and Amazon."
1.0,"Unlike some other bands, it is very hard to install and is either too tight or too loose to fit my wrist properly.  Also, pins in the links fall out too easily"
1.0,Deceiving advertising.  We only received 1 costume!  Definitely not worth the price.  I should have read the fine print.
1.0,Item didn't resemble what was shown; it was black n blue not light grey so didn't even open
1.0,"Those mask are not good to buy, when you put them on, they are to close to your mouth that is hard to talk and to close to your nose that you can’t breath. Not a good buy."
1.0,Not to my satisfaction
1.0,"The brown purse was not brown but a hideous orange color. The wristlet straps fell from the purse and were cheaply made on both the black and brown purses. they are also a very waxy looking leather, definably not as advertised."
1.0,It is too small for my head. I;m a 7 5/8
1.0,"We can't close it, it's damaged. I have no use for it. So upsetting."
1.0,I loved it but it wouldn't stay n my mouth
1.0,I ordered the navy blue watch band and received sky blue...FAIL
1.0,Too small. Very very thick gross material. Returned them.
1.0,It is made of cheap plastic and does not keep correct time!
1.0,This product was such a waste of time and money. Looks nothing as advertised and I would never purchase anything from this company again. The print on the shirt was so small and disproportioned along with it being a horrible steam print. Do not waste your time.
1.0,Didn't like the colors/size. pics don't do enough justice
1.0,I bought this for my 7 year old and did not fit. so now my 4 year old wears it. That's how small a 7-8 size dress is.
1.0,I thought the dress was somewhat stiff.
1.0,This skirt is awful! The pattern is completely different from the picture shown on here and the bow wasn’t there. Very disappointed. I returned it the very next day.
1.0,"I chose only one star because they looked good and fit well, but my new son-in-law said they did not leave the imprint in the sand.  He tried them several times but had no luck."
1.0,I dislike this product
1.0,Once I received the mask I plugged it in to charge it.  I charged for a couple of hours and it still didnt work.  It took a couple of months to receive it.  Never again from this company.
1.0,not wide fit as stated in the ad
1.0,"These shoes look adorable in the pictures, but in real life, they run too big, are much more sparkly and look very cheaply made. Parts of the shoe, like around the ankle part are white-ish like the fabric is coming off, a simple black permanent marker or fabric pen can fix this, also you can see the glue that was used to glue the rubber or whatever it is to the bottom of the heel. I was excited when I bought these shoes and couldn't wait to get them and wear them, but cannot. They run big, are poorly made and look like a child's art project instead of super cute shoes. Being a woman who has to wear little kid shoes, I expected better quality. I guess you get what you paid for. Luckily, I got my money back. I don't recommend these shoes at all."
1.0,The purple/lilac is HARDLY noticeable. I thought it'd be more like the picture. I'll return these because I wanted the purple color to be more prominent.
1.0,"Very beautiful, it is only to be used at times, that is to say a couple of times because then they get very ugly!"
1.0,"The sizing chart provided is not accurate.  I ordered the largest size available, and the arms were too small.  I am not a large person.  This is just a Chinese import, and they have a drastically different way of sizing garments from the Americas.<br /><br />If you try to send it back, you have to pay for return shipping, FYI.<br /><br />The coat is so beautiful, and I wish it was as advertised."
1.0,It's supposed to be a 6xl but I still couldn't get it around my waist. I only weigh 270 lbs  so it should have been able to fit.
1.0,Cheap.....my 6 year old's toe was coming out of them after the second wear.
1.0,Side piece fell off after one month of normal use.
1.0,I bought the big kids size for my 2 year old son because toddler size stuff usually doesn't fit over his big head. I couldn't even fit this size over his head either. The only reason I'm not returning it is because I mistakingly purchased it thinking it was Prime Eligible (which it wasn't) and I don't want to pay half of what I paid for this turtleneck in shipping costs. It's heading to our local Goodwill asap.
1.0,"I wore these once and taking them off after wearing them, the post fell off one right into my hands....not happy!"
1.0,"Loved the 2 masks, but after wearing one of them 4x, sequins started falling off. Total waste of money! Get these off the Amazon site!"
1.0,"I would have returned, but I kept putting it off till it was too late. I don't recommend it."
1.0,Don't buy this. It looks nothing like the picture.  Cheap quality!
1.0,these are cute ONLY for a kids make up play..... not for a real wedding very cheap looking
1.0,I knew as soon as I open the box they were wrong. They are not much thicker than warm weather dress socks and they're barely over the boot let alone over the calf way too small Way Too Thin
1.0,Not what I thought it was the top cover doesn't stay shut
1.0,"Tricked by reviews, this is one of the most uncomfortable slippers I had the displeasure in wearing. Within moments, I could tell it was going to similar standing on a very uncomfortable surface with 0 cushion, and ventilation (its like wrapping your foot in hard rubber, its going to sweat within moments). Not sure why this product was so highly reviewed on so many sites"
1.0,When I receive the item some of the stones had fallen out of their places and we're in the Box. I'm giving this as a gift. I will probably end up returning it.
1.0,This product fit my daughter very well. It was very comfortable for her. She wore this one time to a play for about 1 hr. I washed it and it has spot's all over it. She didn't spill anything on it and it didn't look like this before going into the washing machine. I've never had this problem before. I bought this early so it will be here in time for her play. So now I am unable to return it.
1.0,After a very long wait. It was too small. Couldn’t get it zipped. Had to scramble to find another dress for the wedding.
1.0,Can't even wear keeps coming undone!
1.0,Too small across chest and arms. Completely see through. Not neat edges.
1.0,We ordered a 6xl for my mother who wears a 4x-5x normally...the pants are labeled 6x and yet they perfectly fit my 19 year old daughter who weighs 98lbs. The size is VERY misleading.
1.0,the head line tells it all.  i thought i would treat it like the last one i got a use ti to sleep in or to just bum around the house in .....NOT!!!!!!  i'll get my money back it fits horribly.
1.0,This is not necessary I by 4 masks $22 us dollar
1.0,loved the shirt.... but it literally came with a hole in it right below the button. seems like others had the same issue. yikes
1.0,My growing little lady loves it and seller packed in a manner that it’s cute and professionally put together!
1.0,hurt my ear too much to wear
1.0,"Within only a few hours, they'd already turned my fingers green."
1.0,"Number 1, this choker does not close it clips on your neck. I already feel a numbing sensation for putting it on for 5 seconds. This potentially can be a health hazard.<br /> Initially when I opened it i thought it was a bracelet but it is supposed to go on your neck. So it clips itself into midway your neck so you can put your hair up with this necklacce looks like you shoved a bracelet on your neck. Very tacky.<br />Also, it says choker and earring set. I only received a choker. This is what I get for being cheap but i am terribly disappointed. I needed this for a wedding to attend this weekend now i still need to go out and buy some earrings. I will return this junk. SEE PIC."
1.0,Cheap is as cheap does Breaks really easy not worth it
1.0,Tight. The other pair I bought from this seller were perfect fit. These are extremely tiny. Inconsistent sizing.
1.0,"Absolutely horrible. Uncomfortable, rolls upon you before you finish wrapping yourself and a complete waste of money."
1.0,My daughter wore the shoes twice and then they fell apart.  The sole became detached from the rest of the shoe and the lining came out.  She only wore them to daycare and to play at grandma's - not in bad weather or anything.
1.0,These must be Chinese or something.  It’s the second time I have ordered a 3x to find out they turned to be about size 6 or 8 American
1.0,"Just wear 3days , but it faded"
1.0,"This facial mask doesn't fit correctly, it was way over priced.  The fabric is thin and gaps I don't feel protected.<br />To combat this I wear two masks.  It is not up to Johnny Was standard.  I do not recommend anyone to buy one.<br />Sorry, but disappointed in the quality and the price I paid $20.00.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sharon"
1.0,Top is super cute and fit like a charm. Tried on the shorts and they were sewn at a diagonal angle. Glad I tried it on before my trip.  Super disappointed.
1.0,Really bad made.
1.0,Would not stay on useless.
1.0,I wanted a cute summer top and this item did not meet my needs. I had to give away.
1.0,"used on a hunt in NM.  Rain and snow started falling, product was not water proof."
1.0,on the picture there is no zippers but when i got them there were about 4 or 6 i just wanted plain black ripped jeans
1.0,I will adjust my review.. If you invest in some 3d mask brackets. As I did these masks work great. Otherwise don't buy these.. there not cut for the face alone .Great colors and designs though. (If dissatisfied you will only get a 25% refund and but get to keep masks).
1.0,"started turning colors, disappointed for something that's supposed to be steel...and ball fell off...<br />would've returned it, if not for the price I paid for it...I don't recommend this item at all"
1.0,I was so excited to get this jacket. I wear an XL so after reading the reviews I ordered the XXL. When I got the package the first thing I noticed how nice it looked. It was soft and really just a great quality. I put it on and am disappointed to say it didn't fit at all. It was too tight in the shoulders.
1.0,"This is so chintzy, cheap construction. They didn’t even ship the bar or it fell out of the cheap packaging. Very disappointed"
1.0,"The waist in the dress is way too small, I couldn’t even get it over my body.  It looks cheap and was poorly made.  It came with the stitching coming out.  I had to request to return it and the seller never responded!  Go with a different dress and definitely don’t go thru this seller!"
1.0,"After 4 months using it, it stopped and it does not work anymore. I tried to contact Affute because the watch has 1 year warranty, but they didn't respond. I could not be more dissapointed with all this."
1.0,"Far prettier in the picture than in real life, does not lay well, would not recommend. Won't be wearing this anytime soon. Not sure that I ever wore it."
1.0,It came after about 2 months and then it was broken. I wouldn't order again
1.0,Material is cheap and will not buy again.
1.0,Description inaccurate. Way to small.
1.0,Not like the description nor photo. It's huge & has full length sleeves. Terrible!
1.0,This is plated silver. You are paying for trash.
1.0,"I am very disappointed. The bracelet keeps snaring all my clothing. Next, one of the prongs fell off to the wrist strap. I Do Not Suggest Purchasing!"
1.0,"Collar loose, stitching frayed, 60/40 cotton/poly. I buy lots of lucky brand and this looks suspiciously like a counterfeit shirt (from Pakistan)"
1.0,its so beautiful! Its a shame it left a green ring around my neck. :(
1.0,"Edit:  Let me give a little more info, I was so mad when I wrote this review.  The costume fit very well and wasn't too revealing.  Although, after wearing it to a party for no more than 3 hours, the top of the skeleton started peeling off from the top down.  SUPER EMBARRASSING!!!  So I can't return it because it was worn, but the piece of junk didn't even last an entire night!<br /><br />This costume is terrible/. The skeleton is peeling off as I am writing this.  Waste of $40"
1.0,"This ring was(IS) a disappointment. 1st off, it runs very small, like its more for a child/pre-teen maybe. I have very slender fingers (generally a sz 5.75 on my ring finger), and this ring doesnt even properly fit down to that!...unless you dont mind having the two heart details spread wide apart (which looks unattractive). Secondly, the details are VERY TINY, does not present as nice as depicted in the photos. Thirdly, the band is very thin, and if you're adjusting often, I think it will likely break.  Not worth a dollar even."
1.0,One of sets only 1 worked and the other the 2nd earring worked for 5 min if that..they are cute but just not made so good
1.0,Poorly constructed. Bottom of top was literally CUT. No seam.
1.0,"Basically one size, i wear a 12 US….i could put these on but they would be distorted and tight, the company told me thats their largest size…..bummer bc i think they are so cute….will fit kids though"
1.0,I could never pull the cord tight enought to get to the grommets to lock the bag. I returned this item. I guess you have to pay for the more expensive one to get one to work.
1.0,"This shirt has a bizarre embroidery patch on the right breast. It's very prominent. In the product pics, it looks like it might just be a triangle, but as you can see below, it's not. It says something like YIDI mutongxion(something). Not only that, the shape is super odd, oddly placed, and not well-embroidered. Thankfully I was able to return it."
1.0,It is quite cheap fabric and not as appealing in person as is on the photo.  Cheap.
1.0,Becomes black after two weeks
1.0,I loved the color contrast. I was upset that the cut wasnt doing it for me. The arms I felt I was swimming in it. All around it was too big.<br /><br />I bought the small<br />I'm 5'0 123 pounds and the jacket just looked to bulky. My mom who is a medium tried it on. Becuase I insisted that someone has to wear it if I cant and it was too big and not the right fit for her.<br /><br />Sad I couldnt keep it.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. Cheaply made. Cheap flimsy straps did come with the pink dress, but thread was unraveling where you would hook it. Couldn’t get it over my hips. quick return."
1.0,The item are about two sizes too small.  After paying shipping and would have to pay return shipping for the return it just wasn't worth it.  I will never purchase an item again that sold like this. It's just not worth all the hassle.
1.0,I wish that this brand made X's size for Petty and skinny people.
1.0,"The size is nice. Color is NOT purple. It is a grey/purple. More on the grey side. The inside is cheap, the lining makes a plastic noise when moved putting things in or out of the purse. Handles are a little on the small side doesn’t fit very well on your wrist/arm."
1.0,The mittens were cute but defiantly not KIDS. My smaller than average 5 year old couldn't fit her hand inside the mittens. Definitely for babies or toddlers and quite disappointed as a birthday present that she had been looking forward to.
1.0,This is a toddler shirt.
1.0,"I've liked all the features on the watch and how it looks. But the band that comes with it falls off, the battery dies after only a day of wearing it so I hardly ever get to see sleep pattern for having to charge it compared to my old Garmin. And now that it just is over the time frame to send it back the screen is locked and want do anything at all! Would just stick with my old one compared to this one."
1.0,Thought is was supposed to purple but it is blue!  Not happy!
1.0,Just didn't look good on me
1.0,Did not arrive as pictured.  Came so tangled that I till haven't untangled it fully.
1.0,You can't tighten the bracelet without someone's help or using your teeth.  I bought 3 of them and they all suck
1.0,This dress was ordered as a XXL it fit like a size small . I would not recommend this product for plus size women.
1.0,"This came and fit my daughter perfectly in length, however, after the first wash the pants shrunk.  After the 2nd wash they are so short in length that my daughter can't wear them anymore."
1.0,I only got one wear out of them. I am a man and I go have larger hands but I don't have problem with gloves. But I guess I got what I payed for...
1.0,Earrings arrived broken. Waste of money. Don’t bother buying these.
1.0,"Loved this necklace, but broke within a week"
1.0,"First off - print is painted on, not stitched in. Manufacturers suggest &#34;Dry Clean Only&#34;.  For shorts??  Made in China -- which if I knew that, I would not have ordered.  Whoever made the shorts, probably only earned about 50 cents. I boycott China for abuse of her workers and had I known, I would not have ordered this.  While not a bad fit, it's a disappointment as I am sure the pattern will flake off soon after even hand washing."
1.0,"This dress doesn’t look like the picture, the material is itchy and the sparkles(or whatever) on it is ugly, will be returning tomorrow"
1.0,Clock foes not work
1.0,"Sent this back, wrong color blue."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS!  You will be wasting your money on a piece of fabric that looks to be about the right size for an elf.  It's so small.  Further, 3 of the 4 corners were curved while the fourth was cut at a right angle!??  This seems Chinese made, very halloween costume quality, not an actual piece of clothing."
1.0,"I didn't like quality, muted colors"
1.0,"They fit very small. The button barely fit in the opening, the look is nothing like the picture. The lighter color lines are basically white contrasting hard with the black."
1.0,"Cheap,  scratchy material."
1.0,Dress is very thin.  Arms are tight and dress is short.  I will be returning.
1.0,"It said true to size.  It was huge & made you look like a barrel.  Should have bought 2 sizes smaller.  I purchased a large by reading size chart.  Might be cute if you had a proper size.  I honestly should have bought a small, ran very large."
1.0,"This is a cheap, plastic version of what it looks like. I couldn't even close the clasp with both hands. Don't waste your money and the time that it will take to bring it to a return station."
1.0,No sirve el material
1.0,Useless. It doesn’t look like what is in the picture
1.0,Terrible. Cheaply made and it smelled like petroleum. I returned it.
1.0,"This was a great coat. It appeared well constructed from decent materials. Zipper looked good. It fit my grandson and he liked it. Okay then ... go grandma! Until she pulled out the accompanying paper that said ""hand wash."" The child is seven years old. Any winter coat will be laundered many times throughout heavy-coat season. But not by this grandma and not by hand. It would be very, very heavy wet. I would never get it cleaned or rinsed to my satisfaction."
1.0,Tarnishes first time you wear them. No wonder it’s so cheap. Don’t buy
1.0,Very baggy and too short. It hit above my pant line but was so baggy I just could not make it work.
1.0,Way to tight on the ankle
1.0,"Very thin, fits extremely small. I ordered a XXL so that it would not be clingy, it fits more like a medium/large."
1.0,I love the look of this ring and the fit was perfect...however after only one time wearing this one of the stones fell off. I understand expectations for quality based on price I wouldn't expect this to last forever however I would not expect a stone to fall out after only one wear.
1.0,size is for child
1.0,"Has to be from china , I ordered a 44DD that looks like a training bra ! Pls don’t order !!!! It came on time so it get one star"
1.0,Turned my fingers green.... Not impressed...
1.0,"Arrived late, if looking at the glasses you can see right through them. No protection from the sun. Worthless would send back but would have to pay more to ship back not worth it. Don't buy"
1.0,Bought this bag for my wife and it has just fallen apart. Just about every zipper on it is broke. It had ripped at the seams. It looks nice but doesn’t appear to be manufactured well. Very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,They said this was delivered and it wasn't
1.0,Does not fit right. Does not fit over my nose the right way. Returning it.
1.0,"I know it's cheap but it broke after the first use. Also, a lot of the coloring rubbed off immediately. How?"
1.0,It is really pretty got so many compliments then the stone fell out wish it was more secured
1.0,Although; this cap is COMFORTABLE; SOFT DENIM AND NICE BLUE JEAN COLOR;<br />  it neeto add a  EXPANSION STRAP WITH SNAPS TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE. It is a little tight for my taste.  Unfortunately; it may Shrink More in the laundry. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.!<br /><br />BUY AGAIN?? MAYBE
1.0,My bestfriend is obsessed with Harry Potter and the character Luna Lovegood.. So when I saw this pen I HAD to get it for her. I opened the package and its a freakin HEDWIG floaty pen.. WTF? And Im not eligible for a refund. Guess I'll have to contact the seller.
1.0,Chain broke  the first time warm.
1.0,Very cheaply made and fell apart quickly
1.0,This dress in white it’s totally see-through.😓
1.0,"The first time I wore this bag, I noticed the outer grommet (where the chain goes through the bag) was coming away from the bag. I opened the bag and realized the second half of the grommet was not attached to the inside. It’s only like this on one of the four grommets. It couldn’t have fallen off because the strap would have been threaded to it. Nope. They never put it on! So there’s nothing for the top half of the grommet to hold on to. Now I have to figure out how to return it though I’ve taken the tags off. What a pain!"
1.0,When I saw the dress<br />Really?????
1.0,"Super plastic looking.  Maybe best for a child, or a costume.  I ordered a size 8 for middle finger.  it wont even fit my 7 size ring finger.  Looks like plastic.  Its not shiny, but tarnished and dull."
1.0,Turned green within a week.
1.0,Item is several sizes smaller than indicated.
1.0,"Def not worth it. Keychain broke quickly and the light was hard for little fingers to push. Light doesn’t stay on. If the keychain wouldn't have broke, I would have given more stars because my son loved the way it looked, but now it just sits in his room"
1.0,"The hat I received is not the hat pictured. The hat I received is dark green, not black/gray. It also does not have the black string above the brim. Not happy."
1.0,I wore it for two days and it broke. I loved the necklace but it was not worth my money at all.
1.0,"Was initially happy with the watch. It stopped working after two months. Never got it wet or used it hard. It was not the battery. The seller offered a code to buy the watch again at 95% off as a gesture of good faith I’m guessing since the thirty day return policy had come and gone. But I don’t understand what the return policy has to do with this situation since the watch was defective. They sent me a code to apply at checkout which never worked and I went up and back with them and they never resolved it. The last message was that it’s valid and if it doesn’t work then contact Amazon and not them again. Well it didn’t work, AGAIN! The Amazon chat agent said they have no way of knowing what to do since it was a third party code and item.  I told her that they said to contact Amazon if it didn’t work. I said I’m not going to bother any more contacting Megir JD it isn’t worth the aggravation. I’ll chalk it up as a lesson learned. I really didn’t want a replacement for this piece of junk anyway. And, as a kind gesture Amazon gave me a $10 credit to use on a future purchase for my experience. Thank you Amazon and no thanks to Megir JD."
1.0,Hi. I bought this s2 watch band and both safety bands are not working and I can not use them. And I am not and will not be in the United States for many months
1.0,Looks and fits like a fuzzy robe. The material reminds me of the same material a stuffed animal would be made of. Returning this ASAP.
1.0,Product was way to small and i went up a size
1.0,These are really cute earings but the area on the wire that goes through my ear always was rough and reacted poorly to my skin.
1.0,Cute but sent the wrong size!
1.0,I put this on my Pandora charm bracelet and a month later it had already worn away all of the paint and is not all tarnish and dingy looking.
1.0,Wore for a few hours and the fabric was already falling apart. Not worth the money for how cheaply this was made.
1.0,I got a large to wear over my swimsuit and it fits like a shirt  :(  disappointed
1.0,It came super dark skinned
1.0,This belt smelled so strong (musty/moldy).  I tried scrubbing it and also set it out in the sun.  Could not get rid of the smell.  Returned the belt.
1.0,"Not as pictured at all. I am a L or XL in everything. Athletic build. Bought the XL and the sleeves were so tight! Not as pictured. Length hits right at waist, very short. Odd cut . Returned"
1.0,Materials and design is not good.
1.0,"Wanted to wear this on National Bow Tie day, it’s super duper duper cute... BUT the item came broken. The pin was detached from the tie. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Oddly enough Brooks doesn't even sell these on their website, I can alonly assume they are fake"
1.0,"So, I just got this dress, and I can’t even get it over my head!! Lies, lies, and more lies! This is supposed to be an extra large. I just want to know for who? A third grader?? Will be sending back tomorrow!!!!"
1.0,They fall off of crocs too easily. They break really easily. Lasted about a week on my kids crocs and mine. Not worth the money.
1.0,Too short and returned.
1.0,"Must be a child shirt! Ordered a XL according to size chart, it was way to tight and short, I ware a size Med., go figure?"
1.0,"Theses are thin and not at all what I had hoped for. I wanted soft, fuzzy, sweater like wrist wraps. These are made cheap and feel cheap. I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,Terrible this is clearly not meant for big butts. If you have a big butt or have mommy thick thighs then No don’t buy this. I’m 5’5 and 160 lb got a size 34 nope stops where the inseam reaches my whowho. Now if I where to measure my HIPS then the size should have been size 40 my waist is a size 34 but I went by the comments which were the size was more on the larger size. Darn I sure missed out on this one but I will say this the color is beautiful.
1.0,This did not look anything like the pic.  Very poor quality
1.0,I ordered up two sizes and still way too small. Waiting on second set to return. Very cute set if it fit.
1.0,What a joke! Adult socks are way too small to fit on my size 8 Womens foot. Plus there is absolutely no “ slouch” in the upper portion. Total waste of money
1.0,Really disappointed. Thought this bracelet was really pretty. It was delivered on 3/16 and it broke on 3/19.
1.0,The strap is not long enough
1.0,It’s was broke before it got to me
1.0,Only my second day using this wallet and the wrist strap hook broke and the snap on the phone pocket pulled thru the leather
1.0,"I tried them on and Loved them! I wash everything before I wear it and these just fell apart, chain ripped off just cheap plastic, and the seams have holes, and the material is similar to a very light wind breaker."
1.0,"I got this backpack because I like the form, color, and overall look; but the quality is just too poor to keep. I have used the backpack over the past month without heavy abuse, just daily carry, but it is already starting to disintegrate. The top handle show stress in the fabric which will rip any day now, there's a rip at the bottom of the shoulder strap where it connects to the bag, and the inside coating is coming off.  Much of the stitching is poorly done and the fabric is so cheap that it's falling apart. I would have loved to keep this bag but it's falling apart."
1.0,The shirt was as thin as a T-shirt and is not an off the shoulder style. Not at all as it appears online. Length was the only thing that was accurate about this shirt.
1.0,Turned yellow after couple weeks
1.0,This ring tarnished immediately after wearing it for two days and left my finger green. :( so disappointing as these rings are really cute but why but gold plated rings if they won't last.
1.0,I do not like them at all. They look nothing like the picture and one even fell apart when I took it out of the package. Terrible!!
1.0,"The screws got stripped and I had them stuck in my ears for a long time. I had to stretch my ears around them, and even out of my ears they won’t unscrew with pliers. Beware."
1.0,"Took about a month to get here in US. True that it is $10 but the quality of this product is worth $1.. The fabric is horrible... terrible cut.. you can tailor one at home with zero tailoring experience better. I literally threw it in the trash can (given that it is shipped from china, it is not worth it to send it back)."
1.0,THE CROSS CAME APART THE FIRST DAY MY SON WORE IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
1.0,"I was walking one day and the strap gave out where the top pin is, as if it's made out of cardboard or something. Super cheap, don't expect quality with this..."
1.0,Broke within 3 days …
1.0,Not what I expected. Oh well.
1.0,Looked incredibly tacky and NOTHING like the picture. Save your money. I tried to return and STILL have not received my refund..
1.0,Poorly made. Strings hanging. I do not recommend.  Don't be fooled by the pictures.
1.0,Did not fit correctly :(
1.0,"So not like the picture, ABSOLUTELY not wearing out of the house! Might make an outfit for my dog with it. Not recommended to buy."
1.0,"""Compression"" shirt is trash. It felt like a slightly thicker and stretch tank top! Do not buy!!!!!"
1.0,"It's too smal,, I ordered my size but  I need 2 Sizes bigger"
1.0,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I ordered this in A-black in Xlarge. I’m a medium and wanted something cute and ovetsized for winter to wear to my families. But that is not AT ALL, what I got. Nothing about this is the same. It’s baby blue with flowers. And all the cuts in the shirt are different. And the size as well is not correct. I will not be purchasing again."
1.0,"Loved this! Bought it twice, but both of them broke within a week. Cheaply made"
1.0,"The fabric is really pretty, but the shape of the mask is unnecessarily unnatural."
1.0,Didn't receive 50 pcs received 2 10 ok. They weren't individually wrapped. Careful what you buy deceptive marketing.<br />Won't but product again.
1.0,Clasp came unglued from the band.
1.0,Didn’t expect movie-quality but it’s bad. The shirt is much shorter than shown. The accessories are poorly made - you can see the lines where the plastic was to be cut and the threads are loose and frayed.
1.0,I washed this several times trying to soften it up but it's made of potato sack material
1.0,"I immediately returned this item. I am usually a size L or XL. Purchased XL and it fit like a Small/Medium. The top was sewn askew so not only was the bust/straps off center, one side was lower than the other. I have a B-cup and the bust was so tight there is no way it was the size the guide stated. Very disappointed as I was looking for a simple tank top dress."
1.0,Terrible. Turned my finger green in a day. Ended up throwing it in a snow bank
1.0,These are mantys there tight short and have no hole in front for peeing..... mantys
1.0,"Have no idea if this works or not. First its really thick so I would think it will add enough bulk to you waist that pants might not fit or it would be really uncomfortable. In any case I will never know. There was no way I could get the rivet through any hole so there was no way to ever get it fastened. They say its flexible and once you get it fastened it will be easy the next time. After pulling and stretching and pushing again and again, there was no way I could get this even partially closed. The belt needs to be half as thick and twice as flexible in order for this thing to work. Mine went right in the trash."
1.0,"received 2 bracelets, but only 1 clasp. can only use 1 bracelet a time since there is only 1 clasp. photo display shows 2 complete bracelets, each bracelet with its own clasp. incomplete order, missing 1 clasp. a bracelet sold as a bracelet should have all parts that make it a complete bracelet in its entirety. not 1 partial bracelet and 1 complete bracelet."
1.0,It was much smaller than the size it stated
1.0,Very hard to close and I found them too heavy to wear.
1.0,Way too tight in the shoulder.  Very disappointed
1.0,"I'm 135lbs, B cup, normally wear size small in most  things. I ordered a small and I thought it had to be a joke how tight this dress was in the top.....I could hardly pull it down. The dress has 0 stretch. Returned right away. Sad because it was cute."
1.0,Disappointed in this item when buying didn’t realize how see through the item was.
1.0,Disappointed they tarnished and made my ears green after less than a month.
1.0,Pearl fell off after one day!
1.0,It came in pieces no happy
1.0,This is suppose to be a bridal shower gift.  It’s 2 sizes too small.  Totally disappointed!!
1.0,Poor quality. All broke the first few days. Do not order these.
1.0,This was not what I thought. Thought it would sit flush with my nose yet that's not how it sits.
1.0,Fake 47 hat. The hat that came is no where near the quality these hats usually are. It's almost as it is a knock off. Would not purchase have plenty of hats by this company and this one does not seem correct.
1.0,The top or parties are way too small
1.0,"I would prefer to give this product zero stars !!!  I ordered a queen size throw ,  what I got was a less than twin !!!  It is a forty by maybe sixty !!!!  The picture on it is so light you can barely see it. It is very very light weight.  I have bought blankets for 3.99 at Wal-Mart that are bigger and heavy than this blanket.  So I paid almost forty dollars for this .  I would have sent it back but my grandson loved it .  This just sucks !!!!"
1.0,"The top part was ok but the skirt was so small and poor quality tulla, only two layers.... it was flat,my girls didn't like it...don't waste your money on these"
1.0,Handle ripped after using bag for a month
1.0,Packaging was awful.  Hat was folded and out of shape.  Got it for a 4 yr old for Easter.  Not happy.<br />I don’t know how it will fit.  I have to iron this for days before I give it to her.
1.0,"No support in the arch, not a good support, comfort design...loved the color and look..."
1.0,"Liked color. Fabric was strange, and fit was way to small!"
1.0,"Cute shorts, but ran several sizes too small"
1.0,"The 'lace' if you can call it that was cheap, rough and stiff. It felt and looked like a dress for a pre-teen to early teen girl."
1.0,"I couldn't believe the poor quality of this hat. Thin, flimsy material, logo is so light, hard to see.  I don't know what I was expecting for 5.00 but this hat is hardly worth 1.00.  Purchased for my grandson. It's too junky to give to him."
1.0,measurement should reflect what is shown online
1.0,Ugly. Do not buy.
1.0,I loved this necklace but then after 4 weeks of wearing it the gold rubbed off. So now I have a gold chain with a silver pendant. Super annoyed because of course this happened right after the return window closed.
1.0,"It is too big, has no shape, hate it"
1.0,The tie is not in the center. It is also not off to the side. It is definitely an error. I'm returning it. Too bad because it fits very nicely.
1.0,"Fue devuelto porque era otro color, yo lo pedí morado y es muy pequeño y corto.Que decepción!!"
1.0,"Returned to company,not As described"
1.0,Totally different dress than what I purchased.  The what’s supposed to be the belt is sewn onto the neck and is just 2 long pieces of fabric for no reason. The neck line is nothing to what’s in the picture.
1.0,Didn't like the material of this product and they don't fit on the face properly will not be purchasing from here again.
1.0,Did not work for me at all. For very small busted ladies it would work great but for someone that wears a size C cup did not support . Disappointed in the quality and support department.
1.0,"Screws fell out, more of a cosplay piece than actual sunglasses"
1.0,Very nice and comfy! After one wash the padding has completely disfigured!
1.0,OHh Lord this dress is a mess. The fabric is cheap. The bottom is a silvery material that will snag at the slightest and the top part is DARK GREY!  It doesn't even match at all. So bad!!
1.0,"Ordered adult goggles, but received junior size, then I had to pay the shippong cost to return them with no offer to exchange to make it right. The tint looked good, but they were too small to try.<br />In addition to not exchanging sizes for adult THAT I ORDERED, I was not refunded shipping charges either way, so I paid over $20 for their error!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:908f0192ce8dc03a59c3bb5c33bb9aff]] After trying to finesse the set up for an hour I finally gave up. Suspect I’ve got a damaged clasp.  If Following inadequate directions like this frustrates you easily I do not recommend. These directions that I took a picture of are a joke and I have a college degree. I will be returning this purchase tomorrow.
1.0,It’s horrible looks nothing like the picture at all
1.0,"Updated review. This is my 2nd winter wearing this coat. The long front zipper is flawed as well as the zippers on the pockets. Also, the hood is suitable for a child. It is very small. Too small for me, and not functional."
1.0,"I purchased 2 belts, Im returning them coz they are very small, very cheap looking and very thin."
1.0,First purchase had these black spots that spread when you get them wet. Returned and repurchased and same thing again with this one. Black spots on the corners of the pockets. Not very happy with product
1.0,"It was so small I could not use as necklace, so I used as an ankle bracelet.  It looked nice—but in less than an hour it went missing; it was completely broken."
1.0,"This is my second bag because I loved the first one so much. The first after months of heavy use started ripping, but having paid $20+ I decided to repurchase. I used the new one for the first time on a 5 day business trip. By day one I saw some slight ripping, after 4days only threads are holding up the handles. I bought a canvas just in case it completely broke. The bag carried only a laptop(on days 1 and 5 only), an iPad and a note book, pens so it was not laden (like the first bag) . Very disappointed. I will see about a replacement /refund."
1.0,Too small. Too clingy. Fabric too thin. Not appropriate for anything other than a night gown.
1.0,The second I took this dress out the bag the top parts are ripped everywear at seams. Only reason I wasn’t able to return this because I looked to actually wear it too late.
1.0,"Correct color, correct neckline, wrong sleeves unless I messed up. But It's AT LEAST a 2xl when I would normally wear medium or large depending on fit and shrink.<br />Gloriously soft but it's basically a night gown.<br />not a feminine cut, not a fitted shape.  Armpit holes are at least double a normal shirt.<br />What happened here?<br />I have to pay for this? No you don't! Click return and they don't ask you to send it back. Refunded, thank goodness."
1.0,I bought this cute watch to wear for Christmas  season. I purchased in October but just took it out of the box. I put in on and it fell off!! The pins won’t stay in the slider!  And now I can’t return it. The return window is closed!
1.0,"Really?! Propress? Pretty sure that is suppost to say ""progress"" SMH.......I paid $15 for misspelled pillowcase..."
1.0,Tie is not red at all. It is bright orange. Can't think of any occasion that I would use it.
1.0,"Fit was horrible, top was baggy, rest was tight. The whole mermaid part was sheer. Yes, all of it! Not lined!<br />I ended up donating it after it sat in my drawer for a year or so"
1.0,"Got multiple stuff from janasya and they have good size and quality. This one is poor in color, material and horrible blouse size. I am 5.6 and its toooooo short and too wide for its size. Bottoms are fine though. I ordered large, just for reference."
1.0,Picture is deceiving. Cheap underwhelming tulle skirt. Disappointed.
1.0,"I received these on time.  One owl had flat black eyes and was more brown in color.  The other earring had raised/rounded eyes and didn't match at all (the second earring was more copper in color).  Both earrings looked nice, but absolutely didn't match at all.  I was very disappointed.  They were promptly sent back.  :("
1.0,(wife) I would not buy again. I am not a large woman by any means. The black print stretches to become like a gray on my thighs when I have them on. I am short lady but these are very long in length. I only wear them around the house now.
1.0,Too sticky. Smelled of chemicals.
1.0,"Total junk, very small & they don't stay fastened."
1.0,Beautiful watch that had hour indicators fall off quickly.  Obviously a manufacturer issue since someone else posted a picture of the same.
1.0,This dress was awful on. The cut for the chest is so odd. It is kind up shaped like a butt and not flattering at all. I returned it.
1.0,Poorly constructed. Low quality materials. Looks nothing like it did in the photographs
1.0,Wtf? Way too small to fit my head
1.0,"I ordered this product because it is purple and adjustable.<br />Once I received this band it was difficult to install and when I attempted to charge my Fitbit the band did not bend back enough to allow the charger to connect. Thusly, I had to remove the strap. It also pinches!"
1.0,"The buttons on all 4 capes came off. 2 before ever being used, the other two after first use"
1.0,Nothing about this was right
1.0,Very disappointed in the quality and size of the scarf. It was a waste of money.
1.0,weird fit and much more high waisted than the picture shows.
1.0,"Wrinkled, too long, and too wide"
1.0,The Velcro straps on these shoes ripped loose after about two weeks wear. Not happy with this product.
1.0,The screws that hold the hinges loosen every time you wear the glasses. Even if you tighten them up it doesn’t hold.
1.0,The fabric felt very cheap and almost plastic-like when worn.
1.0,"Horrible, don't waste your money.  Arm holes really tiny, fabric would need to wrap around twice in order to fit."
1.0,When i received them ofc i tried them and they fit. A little on the snug side but i could wear them. I washed them and they shrunk i cannot wear them anymore and i really needed a pair of jeans. And they have a strong dye smell that didn't go away in the wash. Waste of money
1.0,This is a crop top that stopped just below my boobs.  It is VERY short.  I essentially have a long sleeve sports bra.
1.0,The fabric is very cheap. I ordered a small and was swimming in it. It was not a keeper.
1.0,Ripped in 5 days. On the side
1.0,Broke easy loved the charm on it though
1.0,"I got this for a gift, they used it one time and the battery pack quit working. Had to purchase a new one. $50. More it cost me"
1.0,"Crap fell apart , screw came out."
1.0,bed quality
1.0,"My son enjoyed this watch, but not for very long since it stopped charging or turning on after only a few hours of use.  It was a gift that I bought early so the return window was closed, hoping customer service is decent and I can get a refund."
1.0,"Not sterling silver, got rusty after a couple of wears."
1.0,"These charms are TINY...not a bit like they are represented in the photo.  In fact, you can't even read what they say.  On top of that, they charge you $3.07 for return shipping!  NOT a good buy, or a good seller."
1.0,"Item is extremely large. I normally wear medium,but this medium is HUGE!"
1.0,Cheesy ... looks way better online. The plastic stone has a sharp edge on it.
1.0,"These fell apart by the second time I wore them! The seams at the back of the head on one slipper and at the very back of another slipper came apart and the stuffing is coming out. They were definitely cute and looked like the picture, but I would go with a different brand that is better quality."
1.0,"The picture is showing this as a nice, faded, dusky orange....well, mine was bright, tacky orange. I was surprised when I opened it. I felt their was some false advertising or a mix-up somewhere. I think someone lightened the shirt color just for this listing."
1.0,"Just not attractive. Too small, couldn’t return."
1.0,"Way to small, I have a big head 😂 if u do too go with the velveetas, ended up giving these to my wife to wear before bed so it wasn’t a total lost, don’t get me wrong on the rating people there great, just feel disappointed because they did not fit my giant melon lol"
1.0,I usually wear an XL but new this was going to small since its made in china. Ordered 3XL and it fit but was tight and hood didn't fit right. to short
1.0,Stems are very long
1.0,Sizes are very deceiving very small
1.0,"Way too small...supposed to be XXL size 20-22...not even close...arm circle too tight and torso way too small...barely could get it on or off...then when I went to return it, they suggested I keep it and they would give me 60% of its value credit...I said, ""No"" send me return label and give me full credit...well little did I know that I'd have to mail it back to China for $28.  Buyer beware and don't buy...that's my advice."
1.0,"The pair I received, size 1, were for someone 4'4&#34;-4'8&#34; and 70-100 lbs.  I was purchasing for a 10 year old that fits that description.  The pair I received were about a size 2 for a 2-3 year old infant.  They were teeny!"
1.0,I feel these are misadvertised! They are WAY SMALLER than the photos portrayal.
1.0,"I am trying to get yellow lens in and the instruction is useless.  I am afraid I'll break the frames.  Haven't even worn them yet, can't get the lens in.<br />Buyer beware!"
1.0,The dress is nice but cut big and way too long
1.0,Lasted a week and the threads broke off in the stud. Looked good but wouldn’t recommend them.
1.0,Received the wrong scarf; returned it
1.0,"I wore this twice before it didn’t want to stick around the edges anymore even though I stored them properly.  Also if you have heavy or saggy boobs, these will definitely not work for you!"
1.0,"They were stuffed in a tiny paper box (not vacuum sealed as it said in their description), deformed, and soaking in water didn't help. Waste of money,"
1.0,I take back my last review after 24 hours of having these on. I decided to do a random check the second toe on my left foot started to turn green this product claims that it does not turn your skin green that is false here's a photo to prove it
1.0,"By far the most horrible pair of jeans I've purchased online. They are poorly crafted with a cheap design. The &#34;chains&#34; are just hanging by a thread. The ends are not sewn to the jeans, so they just flap out awkwardly. The holes to fasten my jeans are sewn shut, so I can't even fasten them. The buttons are overlapping, so I probably would not even be able to fasten them if I tried. The design on the jeans look so cheap, and cheesy that it looks like an elementary school fashion project. Putting the jeans on still doesn't stop the chains from hanging stupid. I am so disappointed in these jeans. I had purchased them for an even,  and knew exactly how I wanted the outfit to come together. I ordered everything online, & everything was perfect but these jeans! BUY THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
1.0,"The anklet is cute, but very flimsy.  It broke the day I purchased it while I was rubbing lotion on my legs. I purchased it to wear on vacation.  Now that I am back, I will be returning it."
1.0,This wallet has a horrendous smell. Left it outside in the sun and wind for 10 days
1.0,Pls don't waste your money. Cheap quality.
1.0,The Tshirt I got is huge so it’s not true to size. The only thing similar to the shirt advertised is the font on the shirt. I received a completely different color and material than pictured. It’s like a stretchy but rough material and light orange instead of the Autumn color. I’m completely disappointed.
1.0,My guess is that many of these reviews are friends of the makers or family. which is understandable. The bag is cute however it is extremely cheap it is not a $25 bag by any means. It has the consistency of one of those $2 reusable grocery bags you find in the grocery stores near the checkouts. It is much smaller than the photos show. It's very thin in-depth. It's too bad they didn't make more quality material. Because aside from the cuteness it's just a very expensive beach tote or grocery carrier. Returning.<br />If This were a $10 bag I would probably keep it.<br />if you had a pen in this bag? And the pain point wasn't closed I guarantee you would go right through it.
1.0,Fell apart within 2 days.
1.0,Ordered the 16 and didn't even get the right size. horrible service.
1.0,"Packaged poorly and contents spilled all over.  Big mess.  Going with a competitive product I've had before and worked great.<br /><br />There was barely enough left in the bottle to try this on my barely ever worn Nike Air Jordan 1's in suede.  Bottle said it was safe for suede, WRONG.  There was a small scuff on one of them so I followed instructions perfectly and it completely ruined the shoes.  I'm at a loss for words.  This product ruined my almost brand new $300 suede Jordans.  I'm extremely upset and followed instructions perfectly.  Besides that, the brush shed 25% of its bristles that first and only use.  No idea how anybody left a positive review but I should have listened to the negative reviews.<br /><br />Furious that I even tried this.  Avoid it..."
1.0,Frames were ok but the padding was all messed up around the glass. Not even wearable. Will not order again
1.0,VERY POOR QUALITY!
1.0,"Sept. 24, 2014<br />I had this robe for 11 days before sending it back. It runs very large and very long. On the 11th day that I had it, it tore between the cords of the chenille. I did not catch it on anything and it certainly wasn't too tight. I had laundered it once doing that time. I believe the material is defective in some way."
1.0,Thin. Skimpy cut. Not at all what is pictured
1.0,loved it at first after three days it broke into pieces. I had to return it.
1.0,No the picture is way cuter than in person
1.0,way to small! I'm a small and order a medium from what I saw in reviews and it was an extra small! Couldn't even get over my head it was so tight in my arms! EXTREMLY disappointed and very upset!!!
1.0,This would have been fine but where are the pockets? Had to send them back. BIG BUMMER.
1.0,"The quality of this Hat is poor. It came out of the package with pieces already looking like they were falling off. It was for my son for Halloween and was going to be worn once so I was going to keep it anyway, the poor quality didn't really bother me.  Then we realized that it was too small for either of my children ( 7 and 9 years old).  Is is listed as an adult hat. There is no way this would fit an adult.  When trying to return the company expected me to pay the shipping."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I got this package, hoping to get a variety. I got three underwear with the same boring, ugly design, bad choice."
1.0,These are okay for a child but the backs constantly fall off or become lose eventually and didn’t last that long
1.0,Smelled funny way too small
1.0,"Got the wrong size, but was a lot bright blue than pictured"
1.0,"And they are louder. Messed with the speed the blades spun going faster and slower, very unstable."
1.0,To large can't tell what it is once you have on face also requested return but was going to cost almost to much to return I quess I'll keep item.
1.0,For an Extra large dress it was like a small. Nice looking also it said maxi in the ad  but more like a midi.
1.0,"I was really disappointing when is pretty little bands did not work. They band length and self while you are wearing it, so you start tight and end up with it falling off!"
1.0,This is made of a polyester type material.  Picture is replicated weirdly on sleeves and not centered correctly.
1.0,Disappointed that it broke on first use.
1.0,This dress is not how it is pictured. This dress is not stretchy and does not give whatsoever.
1.0,The clasp keeps opening up.
1.0,The stone literally fell out the day that I got it and wore it for the first time. The stone is so small that I lost it and now cannot wear this.
1.0,"First of all they do fit perfectly and work, but they are made of really cheap no grip plastic! So they work but get a one star for lying and stating they are OEM Which they are not! Not even close!"
1.0,See through!!!!!!
1.0,"These gloves run a size smaller than the label. I normally wear a small but what I received was more like an extra small compared to the US size small gloves I was replacing. I returned them for a medium, which fits like a small. However, the gloves were damaged when they arrived, so I had to return them *again*. After two tries and two returns, I'll be looking elsewhere for gloves."
1.0,Very thin and has lots of long fibers on the back side
1.0,Did not adhere to the phone at all.  The sticky portion was only around the edge of the glass and had nothing sticky to the screen itself.  Literally fell right off.
1.0,"I am 4'11&#34; 150lbs, size 36/38DD/E depending on the time of month and my diet. Usually I wear a size 10/12 dress, size 8/10 or 29 pants.<br />The straps on this were long and not adjustable. So too low cut for me. It was very form fitting, but not really in a good way.<br />Also, the fabric was reaaaally cheap looking. Like undergarment quality jersey that is shiny."
1.0,"I just received this watch this afternoon. I was very excited to receive it, believing it was going to be blue like the video reviews say it is. The description also indicates it is blue. The videos and description even going to say that as the watch moves on your wrist, it flashes different hues of blue. No such thing.<br /><br />It is nothing of the sort. It is a plain silver face watch. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a pretty watch, but if you were looking for a blue watch, this is not it.<br /><br />I will be returning it tomorrow. By the way, this is the second Seiko I have bought in  the last 30 days that advertised the face is blue. Neither one was. This one, as I said, with silver. The first one was almost black.<br /><br />I called my jeweler to see if I could come in person and pick out a “blue” Seico. They indicated they are not ordering Seikos anymore because they don’t think they’re carrying the line in the future.<br /><br />Maybe there’s a reason for that.<br /><br />I’m very disappointed in Seiko advertising something that is not real."
1.0,It’s so short it’s basically a shirt
1.0,"Didn't work, turned skin green"
1.0,So tiny I never did get it opened
1.0,"This is the dumpiest fitting and looking sweatshirt I have ever seen. I don't know how it can have such a high rating. The arms are almost as wide as the sweatshirt itself. I could fit like five of my arms in each sleeve. This sweatshirt looks and feels so ridiculous that you can't even wear it around the house. If you are morbidly obese and have big, fat flabby arms, this might work for you. For the rest of the population, it is completely worthless and a waste of money, no matter how cheap you buy it for. Russell needs to get it together, I had a nice sweatshirt from them many, many years ago. They have obviously lowered their standards and quality control. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,"I guess i could have ordered a larger size, but then it would have been too long."
1.0,I spent so long looking for wallets and decided on this one. It came and the zipper was broken. Horrible design.
1.0,I know most of us aren't model body but I'd like for my dresses to at least come close to what is on the model in the picture. I ordered my normal size and it was way too big but only in the areas that it really mattered. Was so excited to wear this to my best friends wedding and pretty much anywhere because it wasn't too over the top but I wouldn't put the person I hate most in this dress. 0/5 stars if i could.
1.0,Fabric a bit thin.
1.0,"I wore this tail as part of a white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland costume and it broke after about 3 hours. The tail itself is lovely and very soft, but it’s not secured to the pin part very well so it tears up very easily. Maybe it’s good if you don’t plan on sitting down while wearing it."
1.0,"Not well made, broke after few weeks of light use."
1.0,it broke before I even got it on... very flimsy... requesting refund TODAY...
1.0,This bracelet is beautiful but tarnished fast
1.0,"This was very small. The picture looks like the size of big tags, But it is very small."
1.0,rough metal and rusted after a couple days
1.0,"As for the actual dress, it’s fine. Looks as pictured but when unpackaged OMG THE SMELL!! 🤢🤢😵 I can only describe it as a stench of dead animal and fish!!!!! Smells like it was taken off a dead body!  Will update my review once it has been throughly washed"
1.0,"When I received the mask, it was very smelly- a foul smell. I contacted the seller and they would not allow me to return it. I shared that I was not happy and the seller offered me two dollars- horrible customer service and the product is in the garbage."
1.0,"These are far from oversized. I gave them to my 8 year old niece. I'm glad they were so cheap, otherwise I would have taken the effort to return them."
1.0,"No, my order did not meet my expectations.  I ordered an adult small size shirt and received a youth small.  Still waitimg for the replacement which was due today and has been delayed.  Not at all satisfied."
1.0,"Nowhere near a proper coat. It is a bathrobe - material, actual style, etc. Nearly kept as a robe but sent back."
1.0,The skirt is very cheaply made. The fabric is very sheer and see through. I do not expect it to make it through one wash. Would not buy again.
1.0,I just return easily broke hole
1.0,"It’s junk! I bought another one of this companies goggles and they were so cloudy, not fogging up but seemed like poor material. I figured they couldn’t all be like this so I purchased another model and brought to the pool and they were horrible. This leaks very badly too. The nose part is real small. They are a waste now. Both of them. I will not be purchasing form this company again. Don’t know how they have all these good reviews. Buyer Beware!"
1.0,link came off the plate the day my husband put it on the keychain
1.0,I really like them but they were too big n also it stains ur feet leaves the color of the sandal on my skin .
1.0,Its okay..not as pictured as far as engraving..the names are all jumbled at the bottom they do not surround the necklace. Material is not quality is scratched and marked up.Oh well it looked pretty in the picture. Not worth the money or wait time to get it.
1.0,Sizes are too weird
1.0,Not comfortable hurts my wrist
1.0,Tried to return this item because it was so cheaply made but no one responded... BUYER BEWARE!
1.0,"This ""Stainless Steel"" bracelet changed to a copper color after waering bracelet for a month! Please send RETURN SHIPPING LABEL to this phone."
1.0,The quality of these bows are horrendous! Most of the ribbons are ripped or coming unglued! Don’t spend money on them!
1.0,es buen material y buena Calidad
1.0,"DO NOT BUY It’s crap. Irregular, too small and sheds all over my house and I haven’t even attempted to wear it since I tried it on...total crap!!"
1.0,"I'm a consistent Volatile sandal purchaser and am quite disappointed in this shoe. It's absolutely gorgeous BUT poorly made. I have tons of shoes, so there are none that I wear consistently, so after having this shoe for under a month, imagine the disappointment I had when, as I was walking yesterday, almost tripped over the flap of the shoe as it came unglued. I couldn't believe it ~ one, that I nearly hit the floor ~ then that a month old Volatile shoe came apart! Do not buy! These new volatile shoes just aren't the same quality as the older ones"
1.0,I didn't like the one piece monokini. It fit much larger and didn't really look like the picture. I was unable to get a refund so I ended up giving it away. The person who I gave it to also said it didn't fit right.
1.0,These were made more for the size of a child rather than for a woman like it was advertised.
1.0,"These are NOT the vibrant bright red as shown in the picture (I've used more than one device to look at it, to check variations). My leggings are dark red almost burgundy! I ordered these to go with a Halloween costume, which is now going to look stupid since it won't match. Awesome!"
1.0,Disappointed in the width.  Had to return as my feet slid around in these.
1.0,Tore at seam when put on.
1.0,"These were very cute, but the size was too small compared to other pajamas.  Also the shoulder seam came loose after just two wearings, didn't seem to be solidly sewn together."
1.0,Cheap piece of tin. Suitable as an art project embellishment at best.
1.0,"this was easy to use, easy to remove & looked good but it didnt keep my lashes on one bit!"
1.0,"NOT COTTON 100% POLYESTER.  False advertising.  I'm so mad, I needed this for a tie dyeing activity while on vacation. Too late now to get what I need.<br /><br />""Amazon's Choice"" how long are you going to let this seller advertise falsely?"
1.0,The quality of the hat was good. I bought this because of the size. The measurement inside the hat measures 22 inches NOT 25 as stated in the description.  That is 3 inches smaller than stated.
1.0,It's see through and the measurements are off. I have to give these to a clothing bin. Only nice thing is the color.
1.0,"Ordered these to replace my Sypder socks from over a year that were just starting to wear out.<br />Normally the brand is super comfortable, warm, and durable.<br /><br />However I have had these socks for a little two months now and holes are already forming on the underside! I was very disappointed, the Spyder socks these were replacing lasted 15 months and these didn't last 3"
1.0,"The zipper on the pouch broke, and I wonder if they make them any wider? I got the biggest ones. They fit in the Length department, just a little too snug for my liking. I have a typical american body shape, you know more well rounded....."
1.0,Only one came in the box and no right sides are sold.
1.0,Zipper was broken when item was received.
1.0,Looks like toys
1.0,Junk.  Completely see thru.
1.0,"I took the dress back, but it is see through. It has no shape, and despite the picture the fabric is very thin. Very disappointed, please do not buy. I got yellow."
1.0,"Weak frame, not worth the cost."
1.0,"My son needed a extra wide shoe, he said  they were too tight."
1.0,"The top half of the dress did not fit. It was very loose and awkward. The waist was a fine fit. Unfortunately for this dress, it is see through. It seems to be strictly for summer or warm weather because of how thin the material is. The material itself is soft and the color is as advertised. However it's too thin to go bra-less, but the back is too wide not to. It might be a sizing issue, but as it is, its so awkward a dress i would not recommend it."
1.0,"I wish it were possible to give this product less than 1 star.  Talk about false advertising.  I should have known the sale was too good to be true.  I threw them away, literally, as soon as I saw them.  What a shame, at any price."
1.0,Gloves ripped after a couple of uses.
1.0,Earrings are pretty but are not usable because loop is too small for ear lobe. Cannot use
1.0,"This is are NOT aviator glasses, definitively NOT purple glasses! This is money wasted.<br />I just wonder how you are still doing business on here."
1.0,"I can't tell you about the fit, because I didn't even get to the point of trying it on. The material seems fine, but the trim is horrible. It looks very cheap and poorly made. Mine had strings hanging from it and wouldn't lay flat no matter how hard I tried. It looks great on the model, but not worth the purchase."
1.0,"I needed a replacement for my Samsung Gear Fit 2 bands, which is what you can see in the pictures of this product, so I ordered one in black, so far so good, but when I received the product I got a band for a Samsung Gear S or Moto 360 that is not even close to what you can see in the pictures, so be careful if you are looking for Gear Fit 2 bans because that wont be what you receive."
1.0,TARNISHED!! TURNED EARS GREEN
1.0,"It falls off way too often , I’ve lost my gear fit a couple times because of this."
1.0,Not a good value. I returned it.
1.0,Cheaply made and runs small
1.0,My shoe size is 6 1/2........half sizes were not available so I order a size 7.............not at all comfortable........very tight fit........if I had not discarded the packaging I would have returned them.
1.0,This product is cheaply made and the white lining ends up all over the front of the mask.
1.0,Sizing completely off. Needed large hat was lg/xl. Also hat was smashed in on one side.
1.0,Got for Christmas and the stem has already fell out!!!!!!!
1.0,I was supposed to get gold but I was sent black 😢I go vacation Friday and this a a huge problem
1.0,Took over a month to come. Finally received it and the quality was so poor I just threw it away. Standard cheap leather band with very thin straps to hold watch on. Looks like band can be interchanged with any watch. Very poor quality.
1.0,Too thin. Need to be thicker to hold a dogs harness if hes a 100 pds. If your dog is 10-20 pds will probably work. Tj
1.0,"pretty ring, love the style, turned my finger green within a few hours"
1.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / ordered a medium<br />This shirt is a mess. When I first took it out of the bag it didn’t even look like it would cover anything in the front... the two crossed over sides aren’t attached to each other, so there’s a high chance of boobs popping out once it’s on.<br />The neck was reallyyy tight and uncomfortable. It doesn’t look that bad in photos but it’s rough in person."
1.0,Ordered this watch online.  It was beautiful.  But the dinky little clasp is not something I could NOT live with.  Am returning it and looking to buy another watch - this time one with a convenient and sturdy deployment clasp.
1.0,Ordered this dress a second time thinking I just got an exception. Replacement was no better. Must be the fabric.
1.0,"I'm 5""9 thought a large would fit it literally is short on me"
1.0,"I didn't realize there are two different types of magnetic bracelets.  This is garbage, and the magnetic stones are weak, so the necklace doesn't hold together at all.  Similar products I've ordered from other companies have been very good, but this is made cheaply, of cheap materials."
1.0,"Had my friend helping me and we used the whole roll and it did not work. It just squeezed my b00bs to make them spill out on the top and bottom. I’m a 38DDD. Sigh, the search continues"
1.0,This looks great in the pics but is cheaply made and ill fitting.
1.0,Its not like in the photo of this product .. It's disappointing ..
1.0,I want to return this dress.
1.0,Uncomfortable. Straps don't allow for you to tighten properly. Returned
1.0,"It does not keep proper time and the clasp caused an allergic reaction on my wrist.  Sorry, not a good choice for me."
1.0,"Does not work, it doesn’t charge my watch I just lost my money"
1.0,Returned ups Seabrook NH on Dec 13
1.0,"I have ordered a size 110 3 times and every time they send a 120. I need this for a Disney trip in less than a month. I guess we will be returning this last one and finding a different vendor. Unless you have tons of time to reorder your proper size I would say skip this vendor. Otherwise, the fabric is nice and the hems are pretty good. If they could send it in the proper size this would be a keep. Good luck!"
1.0,The sizing is horribly wrong!
1.0,"Very cheap and stretchy material.  Design is printed faded and very static fabric,  sticks on you and moves around."
1.0,Got these for my daughter for her birthday.  She put them on for a few minutes Thursday. Wore them a bit Saturday.  By Sunday evening one shoe won't charge properly and only has 2 colors.  WI'll sadly be returning them.  Should have listened to the reviews.
1.0,They are comfortable enough but no ball pouch you can get same comfort far cheaper false advertising on ball pouch whole reason I ordered
1.0,"If this is any close to the human face, then your mama was a donkey."
1.0,It’s not nice in actual so I return it. Because I will give it to my husband and send it to him in the Philippines.
1.0,They are thin...which I expected from the reviews and I was ok with but they are big...and I have a normal size head. They are just way to stretchy. Not what I was wanting at all. The colors are nice though and just what I needed but to bad they don't fit.
1.0,"Every pair of gloves I wear are XL.  The gloves that came in look nice, but I cant even get them on my hand.  WAY TOO SMALL!!!"
1.0,"These are terrible! The  adhesive silicone doesn't stay put. The adhesive part is so squishy and so sticky messy it got all over my stockings. The heel pad stoped sticking to my dress shoes arfer a week because the silicone jel kept getting stuck to my heel or stockings. The product does add comfort but its tedious trying to slip your foot in and out of shoes without moving the pad out of place because the sticky edges buldge out and stick to you, even with a shoe horn. This product is like sticky gac."
1.0,Don’t buy stretched after wearing a half hour. Not same material as other GV Amanda’s
1.0,Not what we expected and beads looks broken.
1.0,This is a $20.00 dollar boots including shipping from wish. very poor quality
1.0,"Not sure who is going to wear this as a dress. This ""tunic"" sweater falls above mid thigh.<br />Definitely would need to wear leggings underneath unless you want to flash the world.<br />Returning."
1.0,Now I know I am allergic
1.0,too small for teen. child size
1.0,Broke within a week of wearing it
1.0,These shoes were really cute but there was an elastic band that rubbed into my daughter's ankle that left it red and irritated.
1.0,I’m a 32-34 (L) waist and I have a grey/lime pair of these shorts which I love. I ordered a royal blue pair and they fit completely different.  The waist is too tight and the leg linear elastic is extraordinarily tight. I will return the blue pair and order another grey pair.
1.0,You only get one and it is super cheaply made. I returned it.
1.0,"This shirt was very unflattering on me. I am a plus size woman, I normally wear an XL but ordered a 2x because I wanted it to be a good size. It may be my fault ordering a bigger shirt, but I don't think it would have been flattering even if it was a smaller size. I wanted to love it! Cute saying. Otherwise, besides size, it looked like it was good quality."
1.0,Dropped it on the counter and the whole tip broke off.
1.0,"I specifically selected a size 2-3, however when I received it in the mail I noticed it is a size 6. My granddaughter is only 1yrs old so she won't be able to wear this for years.  Very DISAPPOINTED"
1.0,"Pin on the buckle just fell apart, not a very good indicator of quality. I would definitely not purchase again. Not even one day of use out of the belt."
1.0,will never buy from dresslily again sizes are never right material  is well what can I say Costs more to mail it back then the blouse was worth.
1.0,"very dissatisfied glasses say made ​​in china, why they sent me a Chinese replica if they said that they were original and pay by original"
1.0,"can not wear these and see around the room, distorted and blurry"
1.0,"I wore these for about 2 hours with normal dress shoes while sitting at my desk at work. Within two hours of minimal activity, I had holes in both heels.  I was shocked, as this is SPANX, and even CVS hose don't rip that fast. I have been trying to get an exchange or refund but it is unclear how to get in touch with this company."
1.0,Terrible product. Had no effect at all on pulling back shoulders to improve posture. Do. Not. Purchase.
1.0,"The keychain was scratched, and the letters were smudged, making it difficult to read. Poor quality, would not recommend :("
1.0,"I got these to keep my daughter’s Girl Scout pins on her uniform. They didn’t work. No matter how many times I tried, the back still came off."
1.0,The feel and quality of this was horrible!! Returned!
1.0,These shoes fell apart. My baby almost ingested the metal pin on the top of the sandal. Scary!! Defective!
1.0,They look very nice but turned my fingers green within the hour. Only wore them once and they have now turned black
1.0,"These slip off my heels even though there is a nice silicon strip in the back. I washed them a couple types thinking they might shrink a little bit and hang on better, no luck. I have tried different types of shoes with them but it never works out. I will probably toss them in the trash. I wear size 7.5 wide shoes."
1.0,I bought this skirt for a dance performance.  It smells absolutely terrible!  I could smell the odor of the skirt through the closed box.  So I decided to wash it.  The entire thing fell apart.  Disgusting.
1.0,Pic is deceiving
1.0,Orange red pillow looks nothing like it does on line and is just orange. Like pumpkin orange. Didn't take it out of the package after seeing it so can't speak to quality.
1.0,"The sole is hard rubber and will not flex, so after a few months it just begins breaking.  Don't waste you money."
1.0,Thin sweater which I wouldn’t mind but the front was cropped so high. Way above my belly. Returned!
1.0,"Chain is incredibly cheap and thin, and broke in two places within the first 10 minutes of opening the package."
1.0,"Two people in the household tried these on; 160lbs, 5'2"" and 200lbs, 5'9"".<br />These did not fit well for either person.<br />The fit was tight enough that the second person, through regular movement, created a stress run from the top, inner groin seam.<br />In conclusion, 2 times these were put on, and a total of 40 minutes wearing them and they are garbage.<br />Outside of this, they look good on and off when they are new. Really wish they worked out as they were intended for my Christmas skirt."
1.0,The size is very small.
1.0,"I received Forum Novelties stick on whiskers, which were specifically what I did not want, and the reason I ordered these specific ones."
1.0,Horrible! My watch fell out of the band without me noticing and I lost it.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"Watch strap did not even  last a month, misleading in the pictures because I thought it had a protector for the screen and it didn't and the buckle broke easily. Waste of money."
1.0,"I wish this product worked right. It blows such an amazing amount of cool air to keep your mask from getting warm, but it’s way too small. I have a very little head, and it doesn’t fit me. XXS it must be. Plus the plastic on the inside by the nose is sharp and was cutting the bridge of my nose when forced on"
1.0,Made my shoe worse. Yellowish/brown spots appeared after my shoe dried. All the hype around this product meanwhile it simply made the shoe one.<br />Luckily a magic erraser fixed the problem.
1.0,Sizing is WRONG. I am a Large and based on the reviews I ordered an XL and it still didn't fit.
1.0,I returned it.  It was not 100% cotton.
1.0,"As you can see from the pics, it is not worth it, dont buy. They came in and they were so beautiful but after 2 uses I saw that the little white elastics were showing up so now it looks  cheap. I wanted to return them but i forgot about them and when I found them my window had closed. Found another brand on here that is not disappearing and same price."
1.0,"This is the perfect resolution if you run out of TP. The mask is THAT thin. Cheap, flimsy foam cut out."
1.0,It is scratchy and irritates my skin. I can't wear it unless I put a shirt on underneath. It is also very see through.
1.0,What you receive is nothing like the picture. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,Weird fitting. Not flattering at all.
1.0,More of a bracelet then an anklet! Broke while trying to put it on!😣
1.0,"Very pretty but broke after week, ordered another and it broke at tip smh done trying, last one I had lasted over decade, only replaced due to age"
1.0,Product not as described. Cap has an adjustable strap. Product description says this is a Flex Fit cap which it is not. This is 2nd cap which is a replacement for the 1st one that also came with a strap to adjust size. Returning this item once again.
1.0,"One glove with the 3 stars was described with rhinestones. No rhinestones, just dark ""stones"" that reflect light.Can hardly see them.  Rhinestones are supposed to be  clear crystals to simulate diamonds. Returning."
1.0,It was some what small and broken! Fast delivery but horrible product!  I also got a card in the package saying if I gave a good review I would get free headset sorry can't give a good review on this product I'll go by my headsets!
1.0,"These arrived stuffed into a thin plastic bag.  There was no manufacturer related packaging or branding, information, etc.  They feel cheap and the fit/finish is poor.  Yet another bogus product being sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware."
1.0,I got these in white but these sunglasses look like they came from the $1.00 basket at a toy store but I also ordered a totally different pr.of Locs Sunglasses & they were awesome!
1.0,Decent material overall but the arms width is horrible. I have attached image comparing this hoodie(red) with a champion pullover of same 2xl sizes. The red one can hold two limbs in one arm sleeve. Very disappointed by the lapse in quality control. Do not buy this product.
1.0,WAY too small.
1.0,"The 2X fits like a medium, I won't purchase any more of these!"
1.0,"I think amazon just became an overpriced wish.com. I thought this would be nice and all, I got the LARGE ones and  I'm 5'5 and 160lbs, and this cover just below my knees and very very tight fitting... not kidding. So, It is pretty much kids sizes."
1.0,Got discolored less than a week ... !!
1.0,Pretty garbage.  Spring for the money and get the Garmin brand.  It is more durable and looks cleaner.
1.0,it broke as I was putting it on for the first time. junk!
1.0,Do not buy this. The hole is undersized and not lined up. This cracked the watch hole itself when I tried to put it together and now I can't use the watch at all.
1.0,I ordered a XXL b/c of the reviews to order a larger size. This is the smallest XXL I've ever seen in my life. More like a Juniors L. I will definitely be returning.
1.0,This is an absolutely terrible quality of print! It looks like tape stuck to the shirt. Terrified to wash these because the print will probably start falling off! These were supposed to be gifts for our surprise Universal trip and I cant give this to my family! So dissapointed and frustrated!
1.0,"This product was opened, with a large amount of cleaner missing."
1.0,The quality is good and they reduce glare but that doesn't even matter when the fit hurts my face. The glasses are not meant for women - they are apparently designed for men.
1.0,"These are fit when 1st try, after washed, trims are loose, poor quality."
1.0,The red in this bled all over the suit with the first wash.  I was very surprised - it's ruined and was a waste of money.
1.0,"Only giving 1 star so I can write a review - I expected a sparkly sequin mask as they describe  - what I received falls so short of expectation it may as well be on another planet.  Amazon, what recourse do I have here and what will you do about this false advertising ?"
1.0,I received mood necklaces but they weren't at all what they look like in the picture provided. I'm very disappointed with what i got. I received necklaces that just say &#34;best friends&#34; but with a rainbow string which look completely tacky.DEFINITELY not worth the $6.54 that i payed. not even worth $1.
1.0,I put the adhesive bra on once and had to take it off to readjust it. When I put the bra back on it no longer would stick.
1.0,👎🏾
1.0,"I ordered a size large and tried it on, it fits like a size small!! And sleeves are way too short ''"
1.0,Pretty sad because it was cute. Easy to take on and off but 2 days wear and my wrist was turning green. Cute for a night out but waste of money for everyday wear.
1.0,"Wore these gloves for five minutes. Had to take them off to adjust something else on my costume, only to find my hands smelled horrible! These gloves leave your hands smelling fishy and disgusting. They run small, made of cheap material and I would not recommend them to anyone."
1.0,"Runs smaller and shorter than expected -more like a top than a dress- and fit is not full as shown. The model must be 5' tall, a size xs who is wearing a L."
1.0,"The gloves were not comfortable and appeared to be cheaply made, so I returned them."
1.0,Not very happy with these flip flops. The off gassing is horrible. It must be a low grade of material...
1.0,I wanted to love this! Size up! If you have any busy at all this dress will not work for you unless you are also a size 0 and buy a large. Bummer
1.0,Disappointed how things it is. Not worth the amount paid.
1.0,Took a very long time to receive. Rip in seam and can’t wear until I pay to have it fixed. Very poor quality
1.0,I was very happy initially with this band however after only 4 months of wearing this band the back of the band is bubbling up and oxidized. I am really disappointed in the quality of this band especially after spending $20 on it. I will not be ordering from them again.
1.0,"Awful! I bought this to wear for a photo shoot and it looks like a damn rag. It's terrible quality (incredibly thin/see-through) and runs very small. I'm 5'4"" and on the slim side so I thought a small size would fit. Definitely mistaken."
1.0,DO NOT BUY ! VERY CHEAP LOOKING<br /><br />NO STAR ON THIS PRODUCT
1.0,Big disappointment. I don't like the style or the quality. Was surprised they had screw backs instead of posts. MUCH prettier in the picture.
1.0,checkerboard cushion was ripped when we opened the package. very cheap cover on it.
1.0,I ordered this and the stick came broken off the mask! It’s also really big on the face.
1.0,Side elastic broke the first time I tried to tighten. Did pull very hard. Must not have been seen into the seam. Also seems very big for a toddler.
1.0,Really cheap and low quality.  Had to return.
1.0,Highly upset with this band. I bought it and the red and black one and both of them are constantly comming unclipped from the watch face. Not worth buying at all. Wish i hadent waisted my money
1.0,Cheap shirt & cheap fabric! Don't order!
1.0,"This ring is not true to size. I own many rings I am positive what both my left finger ring sizes are. My left is smaller than my right because it has shrunk due to wearing my wedding ring for years. The ring I ordered was a size 7, but what came to me was so huge, it had to be ATLEAST a size 8. I sent it back and ordered a size 6 so we'll see if that will be small enough for my finger. Other than that, it looks like a nice ring, I only wore it once though."
1.0,Not worth it!
1.0,This is a very poorly made product. Within the first week of normal wearing one of the gloves had already started tearing apart.
1.0,not satisfied at all. the jewel is like a clear plastic and not shiny or blingy at all. also needs to say PLUGS SOLD INDIVIDUALLY instead of saying “price per 1” $13.00 for a SINGLE low quality plug is ridiculous.
1.0,not cute on too small on top and short in body
1.0,Fabric is a lightweight stretch jersey rather than a fleece or french terry.
1.0,"El tamaño no es funcional, demasiado pequeño. Seria para lentes de niño"
1.0,I never rec'd the one I really  wanted.I had to take another color.
1.0,Black stripe is cheap looking vinyl.  Purse is tiny.
1.0,"Much more sparkly than pictured, the metal looks cheap and tarnished, and they don't fit as pictured."
1.0,I didn't like that it was very very see-through and the material was not what I expected. Also it fit way too large on me.
1.0,I’m sending this watch back because it’s out of time by hours.  I have to tap it to initiate the second hand to start moving.
1.0,"The pictures and descriptions were so cute, but size large in this dress was as short as a standard t-shirt. Very disappointed ."
1.0,Don't buy these shirts online!!  The sizing is always off and the quality is not commensurate with the price.  Never again.
1.0,"So cute, but way too small. They say XL would fit 38-40 C-D.  No way.  Wish they made these cute bra-lets in American sizes."
1.0,"This was a Christmas present for a family member who lives out of state. Long story short, although the garment looks fashionable and warm, the zipper gets inextricably stuck and is pretty much impossible to open up without ripping the sweater. The only way to wear this is leaving the zipper half zipped (where it's stuck), and pulling it over his head. Unfortunately, he was hesitant to mention why he hadn't been able to wear the sweater until the window for return was closed."
1.0,No way in hell do they fit adults
1.0,Not silver turns finger colors
1.0,Workmanship on the placing of the cz arent laid evenly. You can see the the gaps in the top.
1.0,Nothing like what the photo of what I ordered
1.0,"Stylish, comfortable, shirt ripped on bottom left from getting caught on side of chair like it was paper."
1.0,many beads were off and floating in bag.  could not return
1.0,Was not hemmed properly. Is more tee shirt quality then business attire. Accent lines are poorly done. Was returned.
1.0,"When I opened these upon delivery, I was in love! They looked great. I was extremely gentle with them, and not a week later, after only wearing them three times, one of the extensions just came off in my hand with provocation. There are a lot of similarly priced sunglasses on Amazon, and many are better quality, I'd recommend a different pair."
1.0,Broke on the first time I wore it!! Very soft metal that breaks after being adjusted to fit your wrist. Save your money!! Don’t buy 🤬
1.0,0 star for bad quality. waste of money
1.0,"Cheap,y made came apart"
1.0,"Never buy this watch from this dealer. Only buy directly from Arne Jacobsen. I purchased the first watch and it stopped working two weeks after. I had difficulty finding a jeweler who could open the back (it required a special tool) and once I did replace the battery (which should have been working to begin with), the jeweler said that the watch had a mechanical issue and that I should return it to the person from whom I bought the watch. It was just a week past the month-return-no-questions-asked period and the dealer gave me a hard time. Finally, with much convincing, they did accept the return and sent another watch in replacement. Now, two years into the watch--which isn't a cheap watch--the watch hands haven't been keeping accurate time. I thought it was a problem with the battery again and took it to a jeweler who said the battery was fine and that it was a mechanical problem. He said the watch they gave me (both watches) were lemons. I  have learned my lesson and will NEVER buy a watch through anyone other than the dealer. This dealer in particular was awful and suspicious. I wouldn't be surprised if they only returned the very same watch to me, since it seems the problem is exactly the same as the first one."
1.0,"I was expecting the material of the pants to be more of a sweater/sweat pant type material based on the images. However, they look more like dress pants or something you would wear to an office. I returned these."
1.0,I bought these for a gift but they were so defective I had to scramble to find something else. They didn't hang straight. They hung sideways. They were pretty but unusable. Very disappointed!
1.0,Terrible. She does not actually have Mal or Uma. Incredibly disappointing.
1.0,"They look really cool, but the base is the cheapest rubbery material I’ve ever seen. Like a toy! We sent them back. One puddle, one icy day and he would absolutely slip. Cheap made."
1.0,"I thought this would be a great case for my new Von Zipper glasses, probably what I thought to be one of the better options for eyeglass cases that Amazon offered. I was wrong.<br />It’s porely made; the strap NEVER stays shut you basically have to tie it in a knot for it to stay shut. Cheap plastic type of strap; not leather and the case is a felt maybe but not soft. Seriously disappointed."
1.0,"I was so excited to get these socks, but they are SO SMALL. I couldn't even get them past my ankles. They fit my 6 year old."
1.0,I returned the item
1.0,The fit is not nice
1.0,"This arrived in a box with no padding, broken.  Started the return process, but didn’t mail it out cause I am active duty military and had more important stuff to do.  I live overseas and shouldn’t have to wast my time sending back a broken $15 toy.  A picture should be sufficient.  Long story short, I just ate the cost.  Full filler should have packed it properly in a box that was bigger than the exact size as the item."
1.0,Paid for two pair. Only got one pair.
1.0,"Material is way thin, nothing like the picture and sizing is way off. Ordered a 2x and it fit like a small DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Returning. Definitely not polarized and very poor quality. One came with the temple unattached. One of my kids bent the sunglasses by taking them off and now the arm is crooked. This was literally within 10 minutes of giving them to my kids.
1.0,"I previously purchased a mask in a large size and loved it. Now the mask was only offered in a 2 pack ""One size fits all"" and there is no way that these are going to fit any average Male."
1.0,Very cheap the hat tore first day and did not fit my 1 month old sons heas. It was extremely tight poor quality
1.0,"thread bare, not good quality."
1.0,Turn my daughter neck green with one time use
1.0,"Very small. Would fit a child, but the band is super thick."
1.0,Seemed like a cute set of pants but the sizing is all wrong . They are way too large. Ended up returning them.
1.0,These are huge! Like HUGE! They look like costume jewerly. I could not just wear these out and about without getting some weird looks !
1.0,Leather was damaged by a little nick on the top.
1.0,"I have waited for a while and this is what I got today! Small shorts in a XL bag! I am very upset!!!!<br />Shorts looks great otherwise, but I have no idea if the size is true."
1.0,I was disappointed in the short length so it didn't fit my neck plus the lace endings were falling off as soon as I took it out of the package. I was disappointed although the product is attractive.
1.0,Product is way too small. Usually wear XL and ordered XXL and they were still very tight and not comfoy
1.0,too thin. Image on one side only.
1.0,Cheap would not even lock looks nice but lock is bad
1.0,Not even close to what I expected. Very thin material and the size was off by 2 or 3 sizes. I'm a size 8/10. I compare it to a junior size 3/5.
1.0,Fits two sizes too small
1.0,Pretty dress but zipper is very difficult
1.0,Very very thin… can see your booty crack. Don’t waste your time ordering.
1.0,It has higher price for similar products. But not higher quality. I expected the quality like price. Of course i returned. Waste of time.
1.0,Not as picture showed... no place on side for any tees. Over priced for what you get.
1.0,"If you want to wear a blanket, then this is for you. I hated it. I will return it. It's oversized and not cute. Reminds me of a frumpy pilgrim outfit."
1.0,"This was a gift for my birthday. This watch has nice weight to it. Feels solid. remove links for a perfect fit. Comes with took for link removal. Clear back piece so you can see inside. This would have been a perfect watch for me except it doesn't do one thing. Tell time. This lovely wrist decoration lasted exactly 5 weeks. It just slowly over the last week has started to act funny and needed 20 minutes of winding to get going. Unlike this watch, I do not have that kind of time to spend on such a wonderful piece. But my husband did as he always wants me happy. We are familiar with these kinds of watches. husband has had one for 30 years. So we know it's not us. The watch stopped working. I would not recommend this unless you need a bracelet."
1.0,I bought these for my niece and she wore them 3-5 times and the sole fell apart and separated from the shoe in the toe area. i would never buy these again. Not good quality.
1.0,Fits nothing like it looks. Sent me  a tiny small. I am a 1 or 2 x
1.0,"These are pretty comfortable and true to size, but the metal rectangle that attached the strap to the front of the overalls constantly rotates and looks silly. I have to twist it back into place every few minutes which is annoying. I may need to superglue the material to the metal to make it stop doing that.<br /><br />UPDATE: My 3rd time wearing these overalls I was at a busy City Park enjoying a saturday picnic with friends. I bent down to retrieve something off the ground. That's when I heard it. The sound of my overalls ripping from mid-back all the way down my thigh, exposing my undershirt, panties, and leg. How embarrassing. I would like not only a refund, but my dignity back as well. *sigh*"
1.0,Soooo see through and it felt like tissue paper. Not what I was going for. Returned this One
1.0,One cuff link came apart (emblem snapped off) the first time I put them on.
1.0,"You get what you pay for and this is really, really cheap.  Would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,"Poor design, the tentacle wasnt even black it came in silver with patchy black  spots, would not recommend buying the tentacle was circular all the way around and not flat so only one end of the eating would go in since the jewelry was so chunky, it was also really long way to big of a tentacle it squished my ear."
1.0,Cheap  made disappoint
1.0,"I usually LOVE Stance socks because the designs are woven in with thread, and not simply an appliqué. Unfortunately, the design on these socks are appliqué, meaning that washing them will eventually lead the the design pealing off. Wish I would have known this before ordering. Beware."
1.0,"These are horrible! I washed before wearing, but they are leaving lint EVERYWHERE! Nothing but a waste of money. They aren’t soft/cozy.<br />But, the lint is unbelievable! Don’t buy."
1.0,Too small for 3 year old
1.0,This product broke after the first day of use.  It broke where the metal clasp connects to the band.  It is so thin that it ripped after putting it on once.  I would imagine it would hold up better than this.  Perhaps we got a bad one.
1.0,I didn't like anything about this shirt. Looks nothing like picture.<br />Returned.
1.0,way too tiny  didn't know the size was so small. like minute.
1.0,Horrible they are not matching they are too big and you can't return them wth!!!
1.0,The zipper broke the 5th time I wore it.
1.0,The coat looked stylish but was made poorly. The sleeves were extremely short. Everything else was fine.
1.0,Not real leather. Too hard and not look nice.
1.0,Horrible no stretch no contour could not get them on
1.0,Awful durability. High action points Literally held together by glue. Not even good glue.  Customer service was a joke when I gave the. Chance to rectify. Sending back.
1.0,Wasn't able to install.
1.0,"My wife is 5.7 145 lbs 36c 39 hips, and amedium swallowed her. These are for heavier wearers, not the fit and in good physical shape types, much extra material in stomache area like desined to make large women appear smaller in waist, weirldy causes woman with no stomache to disguise look frumpy"
1.0,The chain looks so small in person didn't like that
1.0,It's made cheaply and is A LOT smaller than I expected
1.0,"I ordered the track suit.The preview looks like leggings type style. That IS NOT accurate. You will recieve a polyester,straight leg pant with elastic waist band. Top was OK. Correct sizing. The jacket too is a polyester,cheap feeling thin material. The bottom of the jacket also has elastic which picture does not show. The description was inaccurate. I would not order from this company again."
1.0,"the glass started bubbling after about 11 months, then it obviously leaked some water inside and the watch started sweating inside and gradually LCD indicators stopped working, so in about a year is is completely useless"
1.0,"I like it but I wasn't expecting it to be so small. Also, the top zipper is broken. Extremely poorly made. I don't recommend this purse. Very disappointed."
1.0,"These glasses arrived in a very small box.  Since they were smushed in the box, they were all bent and/or damaged.  Upon trying them on, they didn't look very much like the images on the purchase page.  Like others have said, the mirrored lenses are very dark and make the clarity of the glasses pretty poor.  I returned them and didn't mind paying the shipping costs to send them back.  That's how much I disliked them."
1.0,This dress looks like a nightgown.  The material is different than the solid color ones.  I bought the gradient.
1.0,"the package doesn't contain the stickers or the notebooks, as promised. too late to return because i need it for a party tomorrow."
1.0,"What's the point in a briefcase that can't hold a standard size folder? I was very disappointed in the quality of this bag, zipper very rough to open and shut. Would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,WAY WAY WAY TOO LARGE.  It is a 5X.
1.0,Very unhappy. I ordered a 2xl but it fits more like a large. Very thin material. Quality is poor.
1.0,"I ordered a medium for my daughter and large for myself but returned both. The main fabric is so thin you have to wear an entire shirt or tank top underneath. I have a white t-shirt bra and even that was glaring and obvious. This fabric is useless. The most disturbing part however, it is clear (see photo) that they removed the tag on BOTH shirts. You can see the remnants of the tag in the seam, I'm not sure why they would remove the tag. Without it, I have no clue who made it, what size it is, etc."
1.0,this was horrible .
1.0,Although the t shirt was nice it bleed everytime it was washed. It looks horrible and cannot be worn again. A total waste of money. I will not be ordering from this vendor again..  It's too late to return this so now it's going into the trash!!!!
1.0,way to small then they shrink!
1.0,Loved the pattern but too tight.
1.0,These are flimsy and size isn't accurate.  They all stretched out to the point they were too large.  Not worth the money atvany price.
1.0,"Product came looking like a miniature version of the pic. For something that was billed for plus size, this is the smallest xxl product I have ever come across. Total waste of money."
1.0,If you want your boobs pushed down and to look flat.. then this is the suit for you!
1.0,Turned my light brown shoes green :-(
1.0,"I like the material, but this shirt isn’t designed at all like the picture. I usually wear an XL, ordered a XXL, and it doesn’t fit or look anything like it did on the model. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,They are not waterproof as advertised.
1.0,Bought these for my daughter's birthday for the girls to make pandora like bracelets as a craft. Many of the clasps broke immediately. None lasted more than 48 hours. Not worth it.
1.0,It was a waste of money. The item is cheaply made
1.0,It feels like burlap on your skin and looks like the mean lady from harry potter if she decided to wear white instead of pink. Rather itchy and stiff and I had to return it
1.0,Magnet not stron enough poor quality
1.0,I received the package on time and in excellent condition. The clasp broke at the hinge when tightening the strap for the first time. The clasp is held on to the hinge by friction alone (No riveting). The hinge itself is a tiny piece of soft steel roughly the width of a small needle and it failed immediately when one of the size adjustment... holes... caught on the clasp itself when I was putting the watch on. Was nice to look at for the 3 minutes I had it.
1.0,It was a gift for my husband and I ordered long but got short and it rides up on his leg🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️😪 very disappointed because I bought it before that's why I tried the long this time but got the same short leg.
1.0,Ugly material big waste of money
1.0,Received an empty bag lol
1.0,Totalynot what I expected these are bulky and awful
1.0,Pay attention to the measurements this thing is tiny. Nowhere near worth $200.00
1.0,"It looks nice, and I'm sure the wrist strap lock would work as intended (which is why I was buying it) but the wristband does not lock onto the watch. When you think it's locked on, it's not. It just slips right off the watch. Oh well."
1.0,Imagine of dragon looks as if its a photocopy from a low quitting printer
1.0,"This material sticks to itself, does not hang."
1.0,"I really liked this suite and when I got it I ordered a small and the top fit but the bottoms were way too small. Since it was so cheap, I ordered a second one in a size medium. THE SUITES FIT EXACTLY THE SAME!! They just switched the sizing on the tag. There is no fit difference no matter what size you order. They also don’t do returns, they will tell you to give it to a friend."
1.0,the size you buy is way smaller than normal
1.0,I literally have 20 to 30 compression shorts and tights. All of them are men's size XL (38-40) so that's what I ordered. What was shipped to me fit like a medium. Extremely smaller than any XL  I have ever tried on. Perhaps it's was a child's XL ?! I am returning these. Their size guide can not be trusted.
1.0,"This is probably the worst thing I've purchased off Amazon ever! I can wear anything from a large to xxl, depending on fit. I decided to go with the xxl, just in case, and it is super tight at the waist.<br />Even worse than the fit is the scratchy material. It is almost sheer, so a camisole is required (unless you are comfortable with your bra showing through) and the material isn't soft at all! In today's world, when there are so many different fabrics that are soft against the skin, why have a shirt that is so rough?<br />I would give this product negative stars, if I could...one is waaaay too generous."
1.0,Not good for surfing!!!  Fogs quickly. Cant see.
1.0,It was cheaply made polyester ugly not worth the money
1.0,"I am deeply disappointed, it is much smaller than picture and it is definitely not worth the money ,  by any means ."
1.0,The shirt is very long and the pants are very short. Definitely not as described. I wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,"The bags were garbage, there were no openings on the bags at all,no zippers,just a bunch of plastic trimmed in black,that served no purpose but to throw away as a recycable,I ordered 4 and only one had a opening! DON'T ORDER!!!!!"
1.0,"I gave this the lowest star possible because that's the choice I had. It was sewn lopsided and it ribbed right down the side while my daughter was wearing it. No, it was not tight on her at all."
1.0,Dont waste your money
1.0,"Thought it would be perfect solution not to have to take mask on and off so much. Very disappointing product in  my opinion. It was very large and would not stay on over face ,kept slipping down. Material is very thin and I did not feel it offered me the protection I needed."
1.0,The worst
1.0,"I'm a size 22, hour glass shape. I have the hips and a big round butt. I didn't like how they fit me. They are cute underwear, love the colors but not comfortable for me. So now they are just sitting in my drawers."
1.0,This was poor quality and I returned it ( paid for the return) and have not received credit to my account! I am disappointed ‘
1.0,Gross smells gross there was a strand of long hair wrapped around the strap of the hat and I added a photo... also the stitching is so poor and cheap! Please spend your money elsewhere. Cute design but man you guys dropped the ball on this one
1.0,This ring is TINY . I ordered RED and received PURPLE.  Not even close. What a disappointment
1.0,This sweater looks and feels very cheap; it doesn't feel comfortable against your skin at all. The look is quite shiny and plastic-like. I returned it.
1.0,Cheap material and very see through
1.0,clasps locked shut. poor quality.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9dcd8e001c4f7880a851184aae799fdf]]
1.0,"Cheaply made, already broke."
1.0,Item was too small.  When we requested to return/exchange they asked if they could refund us $8 and keep the sweater. It’s way too small!  My 16 year old son actually purchased this with his own money from his 1st paycheck from his new job. Do not waste your money. Fabric feels like foam.
1.0,"Great product except size exceeds ears and you cannot fold to fit or speakers are put of place.  If you try to pull down only to ears, it falls off or leaves to much material on head to wear hats, helmets etc."
1.0,Nike sign was ripped off the front of the shirt
1.0,"awful. don't waste your money! These are small, impossible to wear and very very poorly made"
1.0,My Galaxy Active S2 blows this one away. The construction of  the materials feels very cheap. The features are okay but don't compare to the other companies.
1.0,This necklace and four charms is really fun to ware. The charms make a tinkling sound when you ware them. When I ware them I feel like a gypsy.
1.0,"Compre esta pieza porque me encantó pero me quedo un poco pequeña. La lleve donde mi joyero para q le añadiera un eslabón y cuando hizo el examen. Para saber que oro es, resultó ser que no es oro ni siquiera 10 quilates.😳😳 Para verificar la lleve a una casa de empeño y arrojó el mismo resultado. No es oro ni siquiera 10 kilates!!! Es un engaño, un timo."
1.0,"Artwork was okay but the mask was too small for an adult. Very disappointed and not recommended. It did arrive quickly, just not useable. Costs more to return than makes sense."
1.0,"Lovely design, but this is basically a stiff plastic table cover. I’m disappointed with the quality of the material. No doubt about it’s ability to be oil resistant, it’s a tarp with a design on it."
1.0,Numbers are crooked and misaligned.  Loud ticking.  Abysmal quality. Returned.
1.0,"the shades did not fit my husbands glasses. they did not cover the lenses, too short on the ends. I paid for shipping and handling when i paid for them and then had to pay for shipping it back. i did not receive a return label so we lost 14 dollars.  not happy at all."
1.0,"The dress is way too short, and does not fit correctly on a curvy girl."
1.0,Not flexible! They were uncomfortable!
1.0,This was no for an adult as described. Thank God I found another use for it.
1.0,Product is very small. Not slim and helpful but just small. It is nearly impossible to insert and remove credit cards with ease.  not recommended for carrying anything other than cash and maybe 1 plastic card
1.0,Not worth wearing. Doesn't have tummy control unfortunately.
1.0,I ordered a charm bracelet and received a xmas tree ornament instead.
1.0,i hate it so much!!!!! all the reviews said small was the perfect fit but its way way way way to small!!!!!!!! next time i am not listeaning to the reviews ever agaian
1.0,A sack of potatoes would have fit the same way ! Cheap material and it just hangs on you and does nothing! Not recommended
1.0,"This dress is horrendous. If you have large boobs, small, lopsided, average, or uniboob this dress is not for you. Honestly the worst outfit I've ever bought. The fabric is nice but does not stretch at all in ways it should. The buttons are too large for the hole and the bodice is a tube. Absolutely don't buy this unless you just want disappointment."
1.0,"It was a bell bottom jumpsuit but it appears in the picture to be straight leg. I did not like it at all, it needs to be discontinued."
1.0,Returned do to the size. Too small. Still waiting for a refund!!
1.0,This item  arrived fast & packaged very well. The necklace  it's self is beautiful. However in my opinion the necklace is too heavy for such a small cheap clasp. It would only be a short matter of time before it broke. I returned it.
1.0,The plastic clip on the shoulder strap broke after about three weeks of use.
1.0,"The straw hat was smashed out of shape in the too-small box, it was too large, and the bow ribbon would not stay in place. Hence, I placed foam weather stripping between the hat and sweatband to make it fit, and I used double sided tape to secure the bow ribbon in place."
1.0,"Cheap product and doesn't fit. When I asked to return it, they claimed because of covid I could not return it but they never mention it on the site and suggested to give it to a friend. Wow CHINESE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
1.0,I put one earring in and the back immediately broke. I would have worn it regardless if I could but there was no way to secure it sans the back clip. Very cheap quality. An almost $20 product worth $5-$10 retail.
1.0,"The fabric is a step down from hospital scrubs. It is... crunchy??? Awful. Like putting on a plastic bag, and about as cute."
1.0,"What in the world happened from the last time I ordered these socks in June? The new ones are made of different material, they are not as natural in color as the weave is different, they do not come up to the knee as the other ones did, and they wrinkle at the ankles. This really seems inferior and I will have to find another source. I hope this review goes to the company as the other sock was terrific."
1.0,I have fat thighs. I did not like the way the tassels landed on them  I gave it to a friend of mine and she love it!
1.0,These shoes are definitely not the real tubulars they look like a cheap made version. They fit me perfect but the front of the shoe is made so cheap it makes my foot look huge.
1.0,"Poor quality.  When they came, one of the earrings was bent and had to be carefully bent back.  The backings were so loose that the earrings wouldn't stay on.  I had to use rubber backings from another pair of earrings."
1.0,"Ordered a 2xl, fits like a large. My 11 year old daughter now has them vs me if it gives you an idea of how they fit."
1.0,Material is odd. Took forever to get and feels very strange.
1.0,VERY cheap! Shorts are extremely uncomfortable and the top give zero and I mean zero hold for D size lady’s!
1.0,I bought this watch band and within 2 weeks the color and print wore right off. Very disappointed. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Verycommom and get it anywhere that sells not nice clothes
1.0,"if you have a small head or face do not buy this, it fell right off my face even with the ear loops and fastened as tight as possible."
1.0,I'm returning them due to they are to small
1.0,"It is hard to believe that this product has such good reviews.<br />Out of the first 4 Stainless Steel Wire Keychain Cable one poked me in the finger and drew blood.<br />On the side with the male threads, one short piece of Stainless Steel Wire was sticking out of the collar."
1.0,Pants are different than the pants pictured.  Pants being delivered are a very dark blue.
1.0,"Idk if my room piercing is weird,  but these did not fit well at all"
1.0,Material is very thin. I wouldn’t wear as a dress. Maybe a night gown.
1.0,"Material is hard, not stretchy."
1.0,This dress is definitely not linen. It is rayon. Do not buy if you are looking for a linen dress!!
1.0,"Cheap bag, but works for Spirit airlines if you are desperate and need a bag without worrying about measurements."
1.0,They are a lot bigger framed than what it looked like in the photo and the quality is a whole level below my expectations. They are still a very unique item to me but are only being kept as a novelty item
1.0,"the lining in the zippered side pockets fell apart. I am not even sure how to repair it. I bought it in December, it hasn't been that long. and I have only had small things like my keys of my phone in there. very bummed."
1.0,"I wanted to order these sandals a few months ago, but it was all sold out.  I was really excited to see it available again and ordered it.  The moment I opened the box, I knew the quality wasn't going to be good.  The vegan leather felt flimsy and plastic-like.  There was no shape to it, and it was laying almost flat.  Wearing them felt super flimsy, as well, and I returned them the very next day.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Extremely thin material. Good for fashion not good for protection.
1.0,"This is a copy of the Mido Ocean Star (only it's smaller) but is just a cheap Chinese watch.<br /><br />The dial is attractive and well-done but the movement is junk and very inaccurate. The crown is so small that you can't grasp it to wind or adjust and the second hand jumps when you push it in making it impossible to set the time anywhere near where you want it, and the GMT hand is not a real GMT function.<br /><br />I returned it."
1.0,The seam in the butt ripped after one time wearing them. Terrible quality
1.0,Only lasted 8 days on my daughter. So sad we lost a most dear and sentimental earring. Didn't work for us at all. I'm so sad and upset we lost an earring :(
1.0,"This apron is thin, cheap and not the same as what was pictured. Do not buy."
1.0,doesnt look like picture. fits like a giant moo moo. has zero shape.
1.0,"These are the worst gloves I have EVER bought!  I am an avid gardener and use gloves a lot.  I liked the looks and description of these so I ordered them but when they arrived and I tried them on I was in shock!  The fingers are way too short and sewn together so badly between fingers that you can't spread your fingers at all, besides being too short.  Absolutely unacceptable!!  I have never had such a pair of terrible gloves.  Ugh!! I can't believe they are selling these..Buyer Beware!! I didn't want to give any stars at all but you have to select at least one (which these gloves don't deserve)."
1.0,"I bought this in hopes for stones with healing (and good luck) properties... if there are ANY gemstone elements, its very low grade.  However, if you enjoy fun costume jewelry this may work!"
1.0,Too small. Size up!
1.0,"Within the first day the I had to rip open the ID pocket because I could not get my ID out of it. The other card pockets on the inside of the wallet are also falling apart. For the horizontal card pockets - I cannot put anything in them because they slide all the way into the pocket and become stuck due to the material. Coin purse works fine. Large enough accordion fold to fit my phone and other misc receipts.<br /><br />Although it is cute and the colors are nice, this is a horrible wallet. Spend the extra money and get something much nicer."
1.0,Says one size fits most but it’s HUGE. I’m usually a M/L but this was like 4XL or something
1.0,"Cute, but it will not stay closed. Returning."
1.0,Would give it zero stars if I could. Broke within minutes.
1.0,Me llegó el tamaño equivocado
1.0,"The ring was shipped pretty fast, which made me really happy and excited to open the package, but when I opened I found it that the stone had a crack in the middle and it was not rainbow colored. I got a size 7 to fit my index finger which was perfect fitting, but I am really upset that the ring is poor quality."
1.0,"Very cute, but it’s dry clean only? I bought this for my 1 year old. Not about to bring a $10 outfit to the dry cleaners.... one wash and it was ruined."
1.0,"This is not what was pictured.  This is a scam just to inflate their wealth and trick the consumer into believing that what was ordered wouldn’t be what they would receive.<br />I was hoping for a fun, gorgeous, and sexy Bohemian long sleeve dress that would make me feel strong, confident, and beautiful making men melt.  But what I received was a thing that had no sleeves, looked like a child could wear it better to bed and sleep in.  Definitely not worth what was pictured.  This went from an excitement to depression within seconds after looking at this thing. I tried to make a positive thinking what the hell and just try it on.  And that was just stupidity on my behalf.  Because I felt like I was in hell for even thinking that this thing could have made me feel sexy let alone confident.  This thing was a sleeper and did not even have a sense or flair a bohemian style garment.  I was scammed into this selection thinking that what was pictured would be what would be a staple in my wardrobe for the upcoming summer and summers would be fun and inspirational.  But alas I was duped into false hope.  I am not sure if this thing is returnable and if this has a chance of being fixed.  The day was on an upswing when I was delighted that my order arrived earlier than what was expected only to be depressed after opening this thing in dismay and despair.  I even had hoped that by maybe trying on this thing that I might just.  Why couldn’t you send me what I hope would make me feel strong, confident and sexy not weak and boring.  It would have changed this review to a 5 star.  If I could’ve given no stars it would have been appropriate, but I did receive this thing earlier than had been expected.  I did also order a couple of other items and we’ll they were what I expected and the one did provide that feeling I had hoped being strong, confident, and had that bohemian style that makes you feel sexy.  Please fix this abhorrent delivery."
1.0,Definetry not what I expected
1.0,This item runs very small. The shirt is tiny. The design on the costume was upside down.
1.0,"I loved the look of this bag online, but when it got to my house I was not impressed. I decided I should give it a try, but upon first use, one side of each strap broke off. I didn't even get the bag out of the house. Not impressed. I'd give this zero stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that."
1.0,I have very sensitive skin! This dress was not only uncomfortable but it was so off on the pattern. I am very disappointed in this dress. It my look soft but its not.
1.0,Doesn't fit my watch
1.0,"If you miss owning a watch from a happy meal but always thought the quality was way too good for you, then your in luck. I'm afraid to wear it because I feel like if I move my arm too fast it will void the warranty and it will fall apart. Other than that, it tells time"
1.0,2nd use the handle came off. Will I fix it? Yes. Should I have to already? No.
1.0,They are basically tights and weren’t the right size at all..... title things better please.
1.0,"This was supposed to be an ALL COTTON ""flannelette"" (lightweight flannel) hospital type gown. What I received was 65% polyester/35% cotton very lightweight (almost see-through) scratchy cheap fabric. The fabric was not even as heavy as the gowns they give you to wear in the hospital. The description mentioned ""cotton"" and ""flannel"" eight times, including in the title.<br />It did have the type of closure that it was supposed to have (snaps at the shoulders), but they also sent the wrong color. I ordered navy blue/grey and received white/grey. It had a label on it that SAID navy blue, but it was in a clear plastic sleeve and was obviously white. It was mis-labeled at the factory but apparently nobody could tell navy from white.<br />I needed these gowns immediately or I would have sent them back. I can't believe I paid almost $40.00 apiece for cheap polyester fabric!"
1.0,This bag ripped within 3 months of using it. No good. Buyer beware.
1.0,I ordered these necklaces for my daughter for Christmas. Upon receiving them one was a C the other was an A.<br />They were a lot smaller than what I anticipated.<br />I had to return them because they where two different letters.<br />I just returned for a refund
1.0,Way too tight. Cuts off circulation to the forehead.
1.0,"poor construction, feels really cheap which I guess is precisely what it is. Also, it's grey, not black<br /><br />Edit - these guys are an absolute shambles.<br /><br />Disgraceful follow up - over a dozen emails pleading for five star feedback, saying they'll send out a different product if I give five star feedback, saying &#34;Trust me, trust me, I promise. Give five stars.&#34;<br /><br />Avoid like the plague. ArcEnCiel are an absolute disgrace to Amazon and the market."
1.0,"VERY CHEAP LOOKING, THEY WERE VERY ORANGE."
1.0,"The dress is made of very cheap material and is see-through. It is also very large and not tailored very well. It looks and feels more like a costume than clothing. Now, granted, it was less than $40. But I have purchased other dresses on Amazon for under $40 that are made very well. I will be returning this dress."
1.0,"Buyer beware, this was a thin, cheaply made shirt, not even close to being a blazer.  The print looks nothing like in the photo, so cheap, returned!"
1.0,I want a refund this is nothing like the picture<br />You should not be able to sell this its garbage
1.0,"This product is painful and irritating to wear, especially if you have sensitive skin. The only place it didn’t cause pain or irritation was as a regular earring."
1.0,"Tight in legs, but loose at waist.  Won't stay up.  Long in crotch in front, but short in back."
1.0,The arm stitching was awful on this - it looked awkward and I ended up just donating this to Goodwill
1.0,Material and color are not what I expected. Dress is super tight and material is see through. Not very comfortable for a summer dress.
1.0,Junk! Material is paper thin and the romper is poorly made. It tore the first time my daughter wore it. Do not recommend.
1.0,dress runs very small....Still hanging in my closet with the tags on it....
1.0,When I originally saw this shirt the embroidery showed that it was black that's one of the reasons I purchased it. When I got the shirt embroidery was white and I don't iron who does that too many wrinkles so I washed it and dryed it and still too many wrinkles. We are in 2018 no I will not buy anymore. Oh it also showed that it had black pearl buttons??? So very disappointed because that was another reason I liked it I prefer the pearl buttons on my western shirts.
1.0,Not at all satisfied with this product. The product description was wrong and just off. Advertised as female fit was entirely to large. Again not pleased and u able to return or exchange missed the closing date for return.
1.0,Color is no where near pictured.. I was expecting purple but was pink.. disappointed.
1.0,Sized to small!
1.0,I didn't read the product description because I figured cocktail rings are supposed to be big.  This ring is absurdly oversized!  At 2 1/4 inches long and 1 inch wide it feels and looks very cosmetic and clownish!  On my ring finger it comes up to the nail bed.  Not cute at all.  This has taught me a lesson to look over the product description even on cocktail rings.
1.0,It arrived damaged.
1.0,This a beautiful item .runs  very small.
1.0,"Curve of lenses and curve of entire clip-on is so great that they protrude from the galsses they are clipped to.  Results is there is only a tiny area in focus through these lenses.  Very, very, very badly designed and poor quality. Avoid."
1.0,"Sorry I don't know what these are but they are not the same quality I have been accustomed to for the past 30 years as a Loyal customer with Ray-Ban. Every Ray-Band I have purchased in the past have had Glass Lenses with strong solid frames. These THINGS feel NOTHING like Ray-Bands. They are lite and so are the lenses, they feel like they are made out of cheap plastic NOT glass. This quality can be found at super markets or convenience stores for $25 and less. I got these to replace my old original SAME MODEL NUMBER Ray-Bands. Other then the same style, the quality is garbage. To confirm that my mind wasn't playing tricks on me, I took out a scale and weighed them. The results were as follow; my old REAL Ray-Band wt. was 30 grams and these cheap knock-offs were 26 grams. PACKED, PRINTED A RETUREN LABEL AND BACK THEY WENT. I drive for a living and need the quality I have always gotten in the past from Ray-Band. I can get this kind of quality at a local gas station. And if these are authentic Ray-Band glasses then they lost a customer for life"
1.0,They say these gloves are touch screen compatible but they are not and the gloves are too big.
1.0,A very poor necklace for your pendants.
1.0,"After the first use, the thread came off on both shoes.<br />Comfortable, but Poor quality!!!"
1.0,"First pair had a hole in leg, returned and second pair the pocket lining riped."
1.0,"The print of the this fabric is adorable and the style is classic, but I washed this dress with Persil detergent twice and the fabric looked as if I had worn it for 10+ years: faded and disheveled. I can't wear it anymore.<br />Such a pity because it was cute and comfortable, but not worth the price to only get to wear it twice."
1.0,"I did not think it possible, but this wallet is a fail.  When you slide credit cards into the slots provided, they are STUCK there.  It takes pliers to get them out.  Very frustrating."
1.0,Color and material are not what they seems from photo.
1.0,No. It's way to long. Sizing isnt right
1.0,Was extremely uncomfortable. The sides scratched me and it just did not fit.
1.0,"Easy to install but not strong enough to hold purses.  All but one clip broke off when I was hanging up each purse on 1 strap. Great idea, but needs improvement"
1.0,This broke in less than a week after I got it.
1.0,Cheap fabric and sleeve cuffs are super tight so you cant pull them up if needed. Honestly very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,The blue is beautiful and the fit other than the armholes being way too large was perfect. I ordered small and am 5’4 110lbs
1.0,"This shirt was supposed to be dark grey but it's a ugly, funny looking brownish color.  Plus it's not &#34;fitted&#34; as advertised.  picture attached"
1.0,"Not what we expected, poor quality and sound"
1.0,"I ordered the khaki colored shirt with black stars version & the material is this odd shiny material that just looks like it’ll feel unpleasant on your skin. It also fits weird, very wide under each arm but a more fitted waist. It looks absolutely terrible on & looks a lot cheaper than what I paid. I now have to pay to return in, even though “Free Returns” is listed in the pricing info."
1.0,These are not surgical steel. If you are allergic to certain metals you will have issues with these.
1.0,They were super cute but my son had them on his shoes for 10 days and they have both lost part of the bucket/scoop and arm... disappointed.
1.0,Size large and it fits as size small. Waste of money.
1.0,Not at all what is pictured.  Print looks like a blown up unfocused picture.  They are NOT form fitted around the calf’s like the picture.  Seams are out of alignment.  Lace on one side is more towards the front than the side.
1.0,Absolutely poor product quality. This happened the very first time I tried to connect the bands together on my wrist. Severely disappointed.
1.0,I was looking to get my husband some new workout clothes.  He wears an XL in any other brand I have gotten him.  Unfortunately these shirts run about 2 sizes too small!  I guess now I have new workout shirts :-/
1.0,Each color is a different material. The yellow is a very thin linen. I put them on to see fit and those seams are all ready stretched and pulling.
1.0,No way to get a replacement mask. Beware... NO RETURN OR EXCHANGES. This mask had a molding flaw by the eye making the mask protrude out! No quality control.
1.0,cheap. lost shape and still feels stiff after wash. Size is smaller than expected. waste of money.
1.0,I ordered this for my dog.  I would of given it a 5 star had the sizing been correct.  They are way too small for my dog.  I measured my dog exactly as advised to do and yet they did not fit.<br />I wished they would of fit they were so cute.  If they would have had the correct measurements I would of been happy.<br />I have noticed that other people have mentioned the same thing that the fit was too small.
1.0,"Pictured is a GLOBE , this actually is flat<br />Good reminder to not buy crap WITH 1 REVIEW<br /><br />BECAUSE ITS NOT AS PICTURED"
1.0,Awful fabric inside and out.  I returned it. p
1.0,Dislike product. Too small. Looks childlike
1.0,Gold plate was damaged by acid or something to that effect
1.0,"This product was not worth buying, due to you cannot make the picture out.  The white in the mermaids were all smeared in the process, which is very hard to see what the picture is."
1.0,"Well, I thought this bracelet was very pretty, but after wearing it once, the chain broke where it attached to the ""S"" initial charm.. I was in a hurry and left it in the bottom of my jewelry box and totally forgot it until earlier today, so obviously the return or exchange window closed ages ago. I'm really disappointed the quality was so poor bc it was so cute 😒😤"
1.0,Sizing chart is off. XL more like a size medium.
1.0,"Gorgeous color, design and fit- but sadly NONE of that matters when it’s so scratchy and itchy that I can’t keep it on for 10 seconds. The fabric shedded / shredded all over my bed and floor.  Even worse, it left residue and sequins all over my skin."
1.0,"It was the wrong item. The item was suppose to say Washington, DC and it did not"
1.0,save yourself the money. this is made from some chinese plastic that cracks for no reason after 2 weeks. sad because they look good. oh well.
1.0,"the word ""run"" was stretched out and it looked cheap and crappy. I regret buying this. Cheap quality, not worth the money."
1.0,Dislike product
1.0,Fantastic! It really Works! Highly recomend it.
1.0,Very cheap in appearance
1.0,The size chart does not give you any information about sizes. No measurement whatsoever! I got a size small which would be a 2. The skirt I got was an XS maybe even a XXS. Returning. The material is very nice.
1.0,"Awful, stiff, creased and scratchy material. In the photo dress appears to flare out toward the bottom, in reality it is tube-shaped like a pencil skirt. Unflattering. In photo also appears to cinch at the waist, in reality it is right under chest so does create an empire waist look. Mostly hate because of the shapeless, uncomfortable, stiff, cheap material. Not flowy at all, not soft at all. Will never wear this."
1.0,I am not happy with this item at all. I only wore them twice to work and they already broke! Very disappointed
1.0,It was too little.
1.0,The bag was awful. The gold parts looks ugly.<br />The bag looks quite cheap.
1.0,"The fabric wa what I had expected,  but the dress runs small, it didn't fit. Now I have a dress that don't fit.<br /><br />DISAPPOINTED. DISSATISFIED....."
1.0,It is nothing like the picture did not like it at all would not recommend it!
1.0,Cracked on edge with 1st use.
1.0,Super bad quality and very cheap Material<br />Get damaged after 1 wear ! Doesn't worth more than $2
1.0,"it's completely transparent. bodycon dresses are skin tight, so a slip might not even fit under it but you will need one."
1.0,Horrible cheap quality .
1.0,"I was so excited about these earrings, but unfortunately, when I opened the package they are dirty with brown spots and do not look presentable to wear out."
1.0,"Reached out after bracelet snapped clean off in a random spot for replacement pins. Paying $25 for replacement pins is not what I was looking for. Customer Service is what I was looking for, really was hoping to like this brand and had several other watches saved on my list. I will go another route in the future."
1.0,"Rubbish. Bought as a gift for my wife, stopped working after two charges. Expensive waste of money."
1.0,"Such a pretty print.  Even prettier then I thought it would be.  But I put them on, I’m 5 6, and they are at least 7 inches too long.  So sad."
1.0,"The picture of the shark on the back shows it going down approx. 1/2 way down the back, which is what I wanted. What I received was a pic of a shark that covered almost the whole back that went almost to the ass end of the shirt and looks gross."
1.0,I didn't like it at all.  I returned the vest.  It didn't fit right and the collar was not to my liking.
1.0,"Very poor quality, look more like cheap night shift than actual dress.<br />They probably used someone else picture for cheap copy of it."
1.0,"The chain is very poor quality.  The clasp broke the first time I put it on, so I had to buy another chain the very first day.  Very disappointed!"
1.0,"There’s run two sizes to small. I purchased 12-13 years-  will fit 7-8 years , with room to grow.  They look and feel Great!"
1.0,Very poor quality you can see the fishing or clear thread that was used to weave the sequins on the top of the dress. The beading is very poorly attached and we sent the dress back and went with a different seller and different dress.
1.0,Lenz are great but the arms of the shades are horrible
1.0,Band broke after 2 months. Split wear the band attaches to watch. Watch fell of wrist to ground....
1.0,Breaks apart and doesn’t seem to hold well at all.
1.0,This was a horrible product. Do not buy.
1.0,"I originally purchased this bag for a Christmas present last year.  It held up okay, but by the end of the dance season (July) it was ripped at the top by the zipper.  I purchased it again in September for my daughter's birthday since she liked the design, and it has already ripped again by the zipper.  My daughter is not rough with the bag, and only carries, tap, ballet and jazz shoes in it."
1.0,This article is very small...VERY small. I am not a large person - but it fit very snug and not flowy at all as the picture depicts.
1.0,Way to small ugh
1.0,Very thin material light weight Very paper thin
1.0,"I bought this product because it advertised a 14mm bar, which is longer than the usual. If anything the bar is shorter than the average 10 or 11mm. I wont be able to wear this. Very disappointing. Item not as described."
1.0,They do float but the lenses pop out constintly and they dont block much sun. My eyes actually hurt when i wear them...
1.0,wow! XL fits like a Med. Had to return. Very unhappy
1.0,It was broken when I get it.  The quaity is the worsttttttt. It's bad and can't be described.  Not like the picture.  Tooo cheap.
1.0,These jeans fit a little too snug. Also the first time I wore them the button popped off.. Would not purchase again
1.0,Way too small for size 9 men's.
1.0,Broke almost instantly and not very protective.
1.0,this was not the proper size- the cloth was cut in too small pieces and it was absolutely terrible. I would never NEVER wear it- immediately threw it away
1.0,"Really wanted to like these, but they fell apart on my first wear!!! My forever21 version were cheaper and much better!<br />I would like a refund. Please contact me."
1.0,"I totally did not like this item, it was thin, and did not fit correctly. Is not a denim jacket a fake jacket"
1.0,"The dress I received looked nothing like the photo. It had no sleeves, it had no shimmer, it was poorly made. I’m really disappointed as I bought this for an event and now I don’t have time to try and rectify the situation. I already sent it back so I can’t take a photo but it was basically a dark blue maxi dress with a slit, cap sleeves to be worn off the shoulders, cheap fabric. The dress I purchased was supposed to be three quarter sleeves, blue with a sparkle."
1.0,Not as expected the material os cheap and doesn't hang
1.0,Not what was described and looked like picture as well as I ordered a small and it fits like a Large way too BIG!
1.0,Looks very cheap in person.
1.0,Stretching out and becoming too big in a week
1.0,Shoulder ripped an hour after I had them on
1.0,Cheap the flowe broak off the day we got it and the pants ate just a no
1.0,Ordered xl. Fits but the peplum part is too short and I have a short waist. Seams also do not line up.
1.0,I love the fabric & color<br />However I got a 5x & it's like a size 1x
1.0,"First of all I got this to make things more compact/minimal in my pocket and it had an AirTag holder built in. That being said it had created an even bulkier pocket for me. Not exactly what I had in mind. Also, I have had to retighten the screw several times and I haven’t even had this for a week yet. I’ll go back to the traditional key ring for less of a blueprint and less hassle."
1.0,"The item is see through, and nothing like the the description. It looks like an oversized lab coat. I do not like it all! And it runs small!"
1.0,"After a single wash, on an appropriate cycle, the collar is showing an interfacing tape line across the collar. VERY poort manufacturing."
1.0,"Product looks nice, daughter wore once and she liked it. Washed once in gentle cycle and put in dryer on tumble, came out with all the edges fraying! Not a quality product"
1.0,"Very disappointed in the watch. For starters, it is very small, but much worse is its performance.  I set it to run on a twelve hour cycle, and that worked for a few days. But now, without my ever touching it, it swings into the 24 hour cycle., and after a few hours returns to the twelve hour cycle.  Half an hour ago, it was OK, but now it says it is 16;12 PM.  Also, the button that lights the face sometimes works, sometimes does not.  Would never recommend this model to anyone, and plan to return it."
1.0,Take a photo looks amazing but made with cheap materials
1.0,It was only printed on one side super thin. It's even cheaper than expected
1.0,Not made very well. One of the straps broke as I was trying to put it on.
1.0,size chart useless
1.0,This is not an attractive shirt. It looks like an old fashion doctor’s shirt.
1.0,"UPDATE!<br />This fell apart. I was at a friend's wedding over the weekend and looked down at my hand and the buckle portion of this ring was gone. I wasn't doing anything and hadn't been doing anything that would have caused this. It just wasn't built well it appears. Sad because I really did love this but I had it such a short time, and now it's junk.<br />Would NOT recommend<br /><br />Original Review<br />It's now one of my favorite rings to wear. Super cute, fit as expected, comfortable and no green finger! Arrived quickly too. Would definitely recommend."
1.0,Did not like the material - it looked as if it was bleached in some spots! Sent it back!
1.0,"The post broke while trying to put them on, also when un screwing they became real loose"
1.0,"Idk who sizes these, but these are not Boys’ pants, they’re Toddler pants."
1.0,The card pockets are too small.  Very difficult to get cards in and out. Very disappointed.
1.0,ordered 2 sizes above what I normally wear and could not even close the buttons
1.0,"So much wrong with this design. Flap opens TOWARD the body, instead of away, so it's a bit more awkward to unlatch it. And when you do, it's also a little more awkward holding the flap open so you can see what you're doing.<br /><br />The clip is placed in the middle of the holder (because it has to clear the inward-folding flap), so it rides too high on the waist. This would have been alleviated by the flap opening AWAY from the body.<br /><br />AND MY BIGGEST GRIPE (aside the fact that I can't return this item) is the clip is nearly useless, as the space between the places of contact between the clip and the holder is so great. The thing falls off every time you bend over because there is no grip. Though this might be alleviated to some degree if you happen to be wearing a belt.<br /><br />Do not buy this"
1.0,"When did Fruit of the Loom become so cheaply made? The waistband is nearly non-existent. Unfortunately, I’ve opened the package and worn a pair so I cannot return them. These are so cheaply made, I cannot see them withstanding too many washing and wearing. If you want disposable panties, these are the ones to buy- otherwise, save your money and buy another brand. These are awful!"
1.0,"Very poorly made. Cheap fabric and when it came the seams were breaking apart. Not nearly as cute as in the photos. Fits like a tunic, not a dress."
1.0,"The pants fit and they are comfortable,  but they don't look like jeggings at all. They are leggings. The pockets and stitching is printed on the leggings. Not what I expected. Smh"
1.0,Order 2 sizes bigger after reading the reviews...was so small a 2x would fit a medium. Not happy with the product
1.0,misleading it show as a bracelet and a necklace in reality it is just one (1)  cz bead  misleading ad.<br /><br />7
1.0,"Made out of super thick material, way too long, I couldn’t believe it was the same dress 👗 I ordered"
1.0,"The material is NOTHING like what is described, nor does it look anything like what the model is wearing in the photos!!! And I’m quite upset that they are not refunding me the full amount. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,Broke the first time I put it on. Very poor quality!
1.0,the bottle leaked and half of the liquid poured out
1.0,Wore this Nightgown 4 x and find a hole thru the material at the bottom probably from my fingers pulling it down. Would mot buy this again
1.0,"This bikini is really made for a preteen, not adult sized at all"
1.0,"This dress looks so much better online than in person. The fabric is thick, too stretchy, and looks very inexpensive."
1.0,This dress was beautiful through the bodice. The skirt was really odd though. It reminded me of overstarched stretchy jeans. I ended up returning it.
1.0,"Great quality for the price, but the buttons are too hard and one fell of as soon it was take out the package."
1.0,Cute but came broken....
1.0,I don't like it the color looks terrible
1.0,"They broke the second time I put them in my ears. I know they are cheap, but not worth it."
1.0,It was peeling off the pack when I opened the package.  Straight to the trash it went.
1.0,broke as soon as I removed it from its packaging
1.0,This band would not lock into place on my watch. I love the colors but I would not recommend this product.
1.0,I bought the white one and it is extremely see through!
1.0,Too small - Very disappointed
1.0,Totally see through. It wasn't flowy like it looks and it felt like it was made out of a cheep table cloth from the 99cent store. Don't do it!
1.0,I had this band on for one day and the links were popping out in 3 different spots. I might have gotten a bad one but I would be cautious.
1.0,"If you've any kind of rear end, these won't fit."
1.0,Too large...XS not available
1.0,Not cute!!
1.0,I liked him at first until I started to wear them. One of the owners was really badly warped and pushed into the side of my head and was very uncomfortable to wear. About the third time I warm the arming it up snapping on him so overall not very happy.
1.0,I returned this item to seller.  Opening was not made with a a normal size adult's ear width in mind.  The width between the earring and the closure is very short.  Listed as Prime shipping but I had to pay for the return postage and insurance.
1.0,Not a very good chain. Very disappointed in the construction of the chain. Chain already has pieces coming out of it.
1.0,I’ll be returning this dress today. The zipper doesn’t work. I have to run around now to find a. Reception dress.
1.0,"I was very disappointed. The size was not only too small, but the low part in the front was way too short.  This item is for someone who is thin, without too much of a shape and perhaps it would be alright for fit.  I returned it as soon after I tried it on."
1.0,"I bought this for my husband who is 5”11 @ 210 lbs and this was tight on him.  He carrie’s his weight in the stomach but this was tight everywhere and short in body length, too. The blower didn’t work very well to blow it up and blow out the legs or reindeer.  If anyone is over 5’10 and a bit thick, this will not work.  Very disappointing since this said made for an adult."
1.0,The magnets make it a total pain in the keester to put on.  Either it's too tight or too loose. Not recommended.
1.0,"Really big and the material is really thin and weird, really uncomfortable and not what I was expecting at ALL. It’s big and baggy in all the wrong places."
1.0,"Can't remove stickers from the lenses!  Please tell me how.  I've even tried Goo-Gone.  If I could remove these stickers, you would have five stars, plus, because they are beautiful!  I am very sad...."
1.0,"These are cute boots. But these are a cheap imitation of what seems would be a great boot. They are rubber, no cushion or padding inside. Wouldn’t wear more than a couple hours, if I dint have to walk much. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"These snow pants tore along the inseam the first time wearing them. The fit was strange as well and the waist was loose, thighs were tight, and legs were very long and baggy. I normally can we a tall so I imagine they would be extremely long for someone shorter.<br />I threw them away at the end of our trip!<br />Waste of money."
1.0,Broke within an hour of first wear!
1.0,"Beautiful, received a lot of comments about it."
1.0,"This is an extremely small 2XL, cannot wear the shirt"
1.0,it will not bring the dress up at all its just a simple skirt.
1.0,Total junk and not proportional
1.0,Not a good quality. After wear it the first time I have losing stitches.
1.0,Use for hiking in snow. Thought these would stay on but they fell of several times and I finally lost one. These are too pricey to not stay on well
1.0,Not true to color. Bought 2x fits like large.  I return it. Material is not true to picture
1.0,Waste of money....It didn't improve that shape of the hat.I tried 6 hats and the Cap Washer didnt help at all.
1.0,Run small 2 returns.
1.0,Scratch easy
1.0,Does not look like the photos: I ordered black and the color was different than the photos and so was the color of the flowers. I’m surprised at the reviews that state that this was really high quality because it looks really cheap to me.
1.0,Cheap ugly and heavy!! Not worth a penny
1.0,"The size guide said Medium was a 10-12<br />When I received it, it’s an 8 !!!!"
1.0,Weird itchy material. Way cheapier than it looks in the pictures. I guess you really do get what you pay for.
1.0,"This cute jackets is not what it looks like. First of all it is not lined so it hangs like a limp rag. Second, the fit through the shoulders was too tight. I wear a Medium in everything I buy, so ordered a medium, but I could barely put my arms through the sleeves. And the color was not quite what I expected either. It turned out to be just a boring beige instead of a taupe hue like in the picture."
1.0,The straps were broken when I received the product so I didn’t even get to wear it. Such a waste of money.
1.0,If you are 300 or more pounds. It does not fit. Of you have boobs bigger than a DDD it will just hang out. When I tried on mine it only came down to my stomach and was very tight. Do t buy if you are a big big woman
1.0,Very disappointed with this brand. None of them fit correctly. I was super bummed when I got them.
1.0,"Got a newborn size for my sons first Easter, he was born in February. And there was no chance of it fitting him. Sized more like 3-6 Mo"
1.0,"The description and picture clearly shows model 855261.<br />When I got the item, it was a model 853186 and a different color (white rather than tan).<br />Returned it within minutes of receiving it."
1.0,"The dress was much shorter than expected and see- through, even though I ordered black"
1.0,It broke after a small impact. Horrible product.
1.0,"Very hard to zip up; this garment was 2 sizes too small. Return was easy, though."
1.0,waste of time and money.....Should get a refund.
1.0,It broke the first day of wear
1.0,Looks homemade not true to size now I have to go out my way to return and this is not as advertised
1.0,Too small!!!😠
1.0,This arrived folded in half and when I tried to put I on it completely came apart. I bought one in a different color previously that I love and is still in tact so I’m very disappointed with this one especially after waiting over a month for it to arrive.
1.0,"I ordered these because they were cute for the price. Well what I received was no where near worth what I paid. My earrings came damaged and some completely broken. This is ridiculous, inexcusable, and I will NOT be ordering from this brand ever again. Terrible and shameful quality. Should not be priced the way it is. Total crap in my opinion and not worth paying a penny for. Save your money for something else."
1.0,"Maybe over leggings? I'm tired of not finding warmers that will fit across my thighs, not fall down while walking and good quality."
1.0,Not what I ordered. Not the same product that n the pictures. I recommend saving your money and getting from another company.
1.0,"I was rather looking forward to this shirt, as I quite like the print (I opted for the flamingo). It is better than average quality. It is obviously not a genuine Hawaiian shirt or the market standard approximation thereof, but it has the ""coconut"" buttons and it's not silky.<br /><br />However, it is at least one if not two sizes smaller than conventional sizing, so that's a bit of a problem."
1.0,"Too Short and I'm 5'4.5"" tall and Material was not Good (flimsy)"
1.0,2 pairs for a reason. Laces uncurl and become useful after one day of use.
1.0,these are the worst slippers i’ve ever bought they say memory foam but it’s just like stuffing for a teddy bear the bottoms have no grip i’ve slipped so many times with these i read the reviews before buying and i shouldn’t have bought them i knew what i was buying was cheap
1.0,Broke within a few days. Disappointing
1.0,Its faded
1.0,Maybe for wire frames
1.0,Just not a fan of these lighter wash Pajama Jeans. I don't like how light the thigh area is - I don't need to draw any attention to my thighs. I don't think these lighter washes look as much like real jeans as the darker ones- fake looking.  I'll stick with the darker washes.
1.0,I don't like it so return it
1.0,"The shirt was cute in theory, and the fabric was nice. The back is a little see through but the style is cute. However, I’m somewhat long-waisted and the front of the shirt hit me very high—several inches above the waist. If I wore pants up to my boobs I could perhaps tuck it in..."
1.0,Very Uncomfortable. The wires in it hurt
1.0,"Should have read the reviews. Like everyone else's comments the description was misleading. They advertise as if you are getting a pair of earrings, and you only get one. It is also cheap looking material. I expect it will tarnish in no time. I will not be buying the other earring. I'll just take the loss.."
1.0,The clasps don't connect correctly when putting in the ear. Disappointed
1.0,Looked tarnished
1.0,THE BLOUSE CAME WITH HOLES IN THE BOTTOM PART. ABSOLUTELY TOO SMALL AND DOES NOT FIT AS EXPECTED.
1.0,"Came damaged :(  I wrote them ,they wanted a pic of it . I just chalked it up as a loss :("
1.0,I HELD UP THE DRESS AND COULD SEE THROUGH IT... NO THANKS.
1.0,Wore this bracelet for a few mins and it broke. It was extremely cute but so thin. I moved my wrist and it caused it to snap. I’m a pretty petite person so it was surprising.
1.0,came to me with broken strap
1.0,I received a return label but the cost to ship it back to China is more than the cost of the dress.
1.0,Cheap material is not stretchable makes balls on the first wash it is ugly it does not fit well
1.0,Unable to use difficulty<br />In tying four strings to secure<br />Mask is a product deficit
1.0,"I LOVE THESE SHOES but have been disappointed with details regarding the quality. These were $160 shoes, and I shouldn't have to take them in for repair after wearing them once.<br /><br />The first time I wore them, the entire sole on the left shoe peeled back from the bottom of the shoe. From the toe more than 1/2 way back to the heel. I paid a shoe cobbler $12 to reattach to the sole to the bottom of the shoe and considered it a fluke.<br /><br />Then, after picking up the repaired shoe, I was able to wear the shoes again for the second time. Within an hour of wearing them, the bottom sole on the right shoe peeled back even further than the first. This shoe is now at the shoe cobbler for 5 days for repair and will cost me another $12."
1.0,only good for people with really wide feet.
1.0,I ordered a x large and got medium.......my husband surely can wear these but I'm hoping my son can....
1.0,The chain and clover is very small... this chain was ment for a 4 years old neck ... NOT FOR A GROWN WOMAN.
1.0,These are so cheaply made. The fabric feels like paper. Terrible!
1.0,This shirt had my husband and I laughing so hard. It's super shiny and I can only imagine a pimp wearing it.
1.0,"Not what it appears as in the picture. Seller ignores messages. Messaged 3 times with pictures explaining my issue. They claimed not have received anything.<br /><br />Clasp is not as well polished / finished. Has rougher edges. Build is not also not spot on. Worst part is the insest for the strap, not how it appears on the picture nor same as another clasp i got for same seller at the same time.<br /><br />Strap insert is too thick. Can fit 3 straps through thah hole. And wearing it on the wrist is impossible due to the thickness.<br /><br />I pictured it side by side with a 20mm clasp for comparison. I do not know if there are and design differences. But nothing was indicated in any of the sellers post to differentiate the 2 designs of clasp.<br /><br />I am an overseas buyer so i can't return it too"
1.0,Terrible falls apart before you get it out of the bag.
1.0,"It looks NOTHING like the photo. I normally wear a large, ordered an XL to ensure the sweater would fit oversized. Well, it came and fits like a medium but more importantly it is a regular sweater, nothing oversized about it, the bottom of the sweater ends at the top of my jeans... It would’ve cost too much to return it, so now it’s sitting in my closet."
1.0,Three of the four pair were already broken.  It seems the glue used to secure the post to the resin doesn’t work.
1.0,Size chart incorrect.
1.0,To whom It may concern the product is not the correct size for my galaxy watch the yellow and the purple one<br />Thank you.
1.0,Delivery was incredibly quick. Product not what I wanted.
1.0,Nothing like in the picture. It looked like a thin thermal pajama top. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Received with a hole, very poor quality!"
1.0,This product runs extremely big.  I usually wear a medium and could easily fit a small or extra small in this dress.  I'm tall and it runs long so that is good.  This seller has horrible customer service.
1.0,"Shoddy, did not even have the gold key ring to slide the keys onto.  Another poor quality product from Amazon."
1.0,Quality not what I expected!  Too small.  Gave it to my granddaughter!
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and it showed up missing a button. Price needs to be way lower
1.0,way smaller then size expected.  and will shrink more after washing/drying them.  My stepson now wears them
1.0,wayyyyyy too small. I even measured myself and used their chart and it was still way too small.
1.0,Cane with a stain on the top of chest. Did notvtil i put on to leave for procedure 8 cant return since I have worn
1.0,Did not like the overall fit and it's to long
1.0,I didn't expect much buying this belly button ring but thought it would be decent. It was super cute but broke after ONE day. Not worth it!
1.0,So small I only got it on one arm
1.0,The attachment is not secure enough. Comes undone easily.
1.0,The photo they advertise is a bit deceiving. I though the frame was BLACK and gold. It’s more of a clear dark brown and gold.  Super disappointing.
1.0,"I bought these at the end of winter here in Minnesota. They are fine for &#34;nippy&#34; weather, not the harsh middle of winter here, the fabric is light. The concept is very good, being able to cover the fingers with another layer, or remove it and tuck it in the glove. Very functional. I wore them four times in early spring and four times this fall. The problem is the quality. They are made in China and we all know what that means. The stitching has already come apart in three place along the sides of the palm, it is simple, cheap stitching. I called the vendor i bought them from and found out they quit carrying them for that very reason. I was not looking to replace them, because I would get the same cheap stitching, but just to give them input. I restitched them by hand with a good secure stitch so It would not be a reoccurring problem. I did NOT wear my fingerless biking gloves in them so it was not a stretching problem. For $35 I paid for better quality. This Swedish company needs to bring the manufacturing home and get away from poor Chinese workmanship."
1.0,"Not sure when the French flag became pink, white and red, but this is what we received today. Hoping the company will make it right, this was a Christmas present for my son."
1.0,"I purchased these for my daughter's crocs and they looks great, however after literally less than an hour after attaching them nearly all the gems were gone.. disappointed. We won't be buying these again."
1.0,"Although it's really cute and looked great, it infected my navel within a week of having it in.  As soon as I removed it and put something else in, the infection went away.  I threw the item in the garbage."
1.0,"Material is awful, I bought xxl as they said it fits small, I like my tops to be baggy, sizing is bad I would saynit fit like a small, I won't be wearing either going for a refund or its going to goodwill."
1.0,Ive purchase other brands of exercise pants in Size Large. (Size 10/12) All were comfortable.<br />This particular brand felt 1-2 sizes smaller. I could not even pull them on!
1.0,Doesn't come with buckles attached and it's TINY
1.0,Only one line of stitching<br />Zip attachment to dress is constantly irritating on the  skin<br /> material does not feel like pure cotton. Not worth the price for sure
1.0,Was broken uppon arrival. Do not buy.
1.0,They were supposed to be an inch high and are closer to 1 1/2 &#34;.  I am not using them and would not recommend them
1.0,"Horrible fit, wire hurts so much, do not buy"
1.0,It was silky and weird. I thought it was a normal cotton button down
1.0,"So, these are just silly -- I have bought xlarge yoga pants from other manufacturers -- well-known manufacturers -- and they fit well, sometimes a bit large. These are Lululemon sized -- literally across the top of the pants they are 14 inches flat. On top of that, they are ridiculously long. I'm 5'6&#34;, and they have about 4 inches of drag at the bottom. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter and hacked off the smiley face at the bottom."
1.0,"They’re beautiful. The plastic part is quality, but the screw fell out and I just got them not too long ago. Super disappointed"
1.0,Sent a few messages but never got a response and never got my item. Don’t use this seller
1.0,These are suppose to fit sixe 11.<br />I couldn't even get them my feet. A complete waste of money
1.0,I’ve had 2 break me this one is ripping. They fit perfectly. However they don’t hold up well at all.
1.0,"The back of this jumpsuit has a spine that, as it goes up along the back towards the neck, branches off into two separate spines. WTF? Also, I chose the ""gold"" color, thinking it would give the bones an aged effect to go with the mask I am still waiting on. It is a bright yellow. Depending on how it looks with the mask, I may return it, especially because of the spine issue. I would look elsewhere for this type of costume. I have an average torso length, but this seems a little on the short side."
1.0,"Only received jacket, no suit pants were included"
1.0,Terrible product. Was not how described
1.0,This product is terrible quality. Felt apart after 3 hours of normal wear. Plus something disgusting happened. Shoes almost “grew” hair on them. I can’t imagine what are they made out of but it’s terrible.
1.0,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. It is the tiniest bracelet in the world. My cousin weighs 110 pounds, has the smallest wrists I have ever seen and this was too small for her. This would maybe fit a toddler."
1.0,bought like size chart suggested even went one size up and still wasn't close to fitting.
1.0,"Very slim, but the other dimensions are large."
1.0,"I need  to return them, they hurt my foot. What is the procedure to do It?"
1.0,"This shirt runs too small, like really small! The material was not comfortable!"
1.0,"this was a shirt, not a dress. returned."
1.0,Bracelet I received was  not the color I had ordered. Ended up with a blue band. Not the beautiful color in the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,They’re stealing images from Luna Skye. This is knockoff jewelry.
1.0,"Great (insert sarcastrics here).  I ordered on Jan 25 and it was delivered Feb 3.  Ok, not too bad, but certainly not fantastic.  So, for my $25 I guess I was an idiot who expected the pins to attach the band to the watch would be included.<br /><br />So, I will be returning this and just go buy a blasted band and pins at the local retail hades hole aka WallyWorld."
1.0,Did not like couldn't get in
1.0,I really want to like this product because the cufflinks are gorgeous. But unfortunately the way that they were put together takes away some of the room / stem to insert them into a French cuff . Which means you're going to be pressing harder trying to work with less space and you will eventually snap them in half .
1.0,One of the unicorns was broken
1.0,"Expected better material, it's 100% Lycra. I am a small petite person, ordered it large and almost didn't fit. Very short too."
1.0,"Don’t but, it broke the first day!!!"
1.0,Dish outfit was not what I ordered.
1.0,The 10/12 ended up fitting the same as the 7/8.
1.0,"Whoever does your sizing needs to be retrained, these supposedly M/L gloves wouldn’t even fit a small"
1.0,These are definitely not below zero gloves I was out in 30° and my hands were cold they’re very comfortable but they’re not warm and I live in Aspen Colorado so I need warm gloves
1.0,The earrings are of very poor quality. Only one of each comes in the pack and one broke upon taking off the back. The studs are too large to fit next to each other on the lobe as pictured. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Too wavy, hard to see clearly"
1.0,Wore it one day and the back broke. Bathing suit ripped.
1.0,"It's printed not an actual patch, super cheap looking... I would go to Spencer's and get the real patch wallet instead."
1.0,Don’t waste your money or time buying this bra gives no support is not a very good sports bra
1.0,Worst product wont use it material is awful and my phone won't fit in it<br />Liked everything else I have bought from amazon.  To expensive to send back
1.0,"Terrible do not buy! Not a cardigan at all, one sided fabric not like the photos at all. I got scammed and not happy, Amazon should start assessing these sellers better."
1.0,Ripped the first time I wore them
1.0,"I had to return these earrings, way too big and the design wasn't even.  They hung about 3 inches total."
1.0,"the watch case does not fit , too small cut outs are not as theu should be ..... expected more. should hav just bought 1st party apple band ..... wouldnt recommend"
1.0,This has to be the worst thing I have ever ordered on line.  I understand by the reviews that some of the stones may pop out.  But I didn't receive any glue to repair it.  You can not make it bigger because it will break.  One part of the description says it's a crown and the other part says tiara.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Runs Very very small. Cheap quality.
1.0,The detail on the ring is no where near what is pictured on Amazon. Very disappointed.
1.0,this is a scam. dress came way to small and is not cute at all
1.0,Diamonds fell out
1.0,One delicate wash. Controller comes off like a sticker… $30. Should be better quality.
1.0,ordered sizes 8 and 12.  As you can see in picture both are the exact Same size but labeled 8 and 12!  Also the colors are way off each other!
1.0,"The upper compression is great. I wanted to love these but can’t. I wore them for a whole evening and they kept giving painful severe wedgies with the thong part. The Lower 1/2 (basically where a normal thong is) was not really compression at all… which was weird, it transitions from high upper compression to almost no compression right at the lower abdomen area which is where, I believe, most women would need the compression.. the lower abdomen!!! Maybe because of the way the compression tapered off?… but it kept riding up in the front and the back giving a bad wedgie on both ends. I ordered my correct size. It feels normal when you first put it on but as you wear it, the lower thong part isn’t compression and stretches up, up, upward and makes it very uncomfortable. I would never buy or wear these again."
1.0,"Do not recommend this product to anyone. Material is extremely cheap, like a wind breaker material but thin. It's somewhat see through. Not stretchy or moveable at all. I had a dance performance and I'm trying to find something on short notice instead of wearing them."
1.0,"I am a big fan of Power Flex yoga pants.I own several pairs and love them for their fit and durability. However, I was disappointed when I received these pants. They were thin and completely see through. Normally I buy these pants for their quality and the fact that they aren't see through. I would not recommend these pants."
1.0,poor product
1.0,They looked like they were from a kids isle of a 99 cents store. Low quality
1.0,Absolute rubbish! seams came apart within days of wearing and totally looks unwearable .
1.0,"Wtf are these? These look nothing like the photo, are not even remotely close to any lululemon product. These came multiple weeks late the the seller has yet to respond to my messages. The fabric is a double lined polyester (according to the tag). I have never been so disappointed in a Amazon purchase before."
1.0,Dress does not look as pictured
1.0,Me siento decepcionada.Es muy diferente a lo que se mostraba en la foto
1.0,Don’t work whit my glasses !!!
1.0,Shoes arrived completely mushed up<br />How can a kid wear those???
1.0,I do not like these glasses because I want to see blue!!!!!! Not with these. Thanks for the screw driver though.
1.0,"Poor quality, got the gray one and even gentle bending showed cracks down the length..."
1.0,not fill as well as described in the site. very dispointed.
1.0,Tore after 1 week of wear. Think I got a defective one.
1.0,This was a a 2XL and fit like a Large. The back of it came to my waist.
1.0,👎 mala compra solo recibi 10 y de mala calidad
1.0,Color is bright sun yellow not mustard like expected
1.0,To small don't fit adult ears
1.0,"I'm 6'1, Shirt barely reached my waist Has a way wide neck and is too tight. The picture isn't at the same scale as shown, shipping took literally 3 weeks."
1.0,When this item arrived in the mail I was expecting to see 2 tougne piercings when to my surprise it was just 2 very small hatch close rings never buy this again
1.0,The stone fall out the next day
1.0,Wasn’t happy it came on Dec 23rd. Fit isn’t what was expected....
1.0,One wash and they fell apart.
1.0,Not flattering and shows every dimple if you are not wearing shapewear underneath. It is a very stretchy material and thin. I wore them for five minutes and then donated to Goodwill
1.0,"I bought these to ring handbells. The gloves are bigger than what I expected. I've ordered gloves before, but these are bigger. Thankfully there is the Velcro wrist strap.<br />Edited 1/3/19:<br />The dots on the gloves are coming off already. This is a 2nd pair of gloves within 6 months.  They do not last. I am disappointed. The last gloves I purchased ripped on the fingers and could not be repaired."
1.0,Very bad fabric
1.0,I got them for low heal for after knee replacement. no good
1.0,DOES NOT GLOW IN BLACKLIGHT. Order the neon green. That one glows!
1.0,I received an empty package. The package was ripped in the corner and I suppose the bracelet fell out. Is there anything you can do to replace it?
1.0,I got this for my husband and myself and it was broken when I got it I tried to contact customer service and I get no help in a replacement. Not only was the bracelet broken but I tried the key in it and it would not even unlock it no matter what I did such a waste of money
1.0,I wear a size 7 and I ordered a large and it was still too small I suggest ordering up a few sizes if you order this product  I was not happy with the size or the feel of the material
1.0,"Sleeves were different from photo, way too small, material was cheap you can see through it."
1.0,Cheap and large
1.0,Bought these pants and they were too big
1.0,I bought these in the light blue color and they are completely see through. They’re awful. Will be returning. So disappointed. I bought another brand about 6 months ago and they are amazing. These suck!
1.0,PRODUCT NOT AS PICTURED.<br /><br />Picture is of a two sided card holder with slots on both sides. Received product that was similar but had a clear plastic spot for a drivers license. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WANT WHAT IS PICTURED!
1.0,It broke the moment my girlfriend put it on.
1.0,Love the shirt not as detailed as in picture at all also not the same cut fits weird
1.0,I ordered these shoes and wore them for less than an hour before I decided it was time to return them.  One shoe appeared to be smaller and narrower than the other.  The backs also rubbed against my Achilles tendon.  They're very cute but I just couldn't wear them.
1.0,One of the bands is bigger than the other. Neither band stays in place at all while I’m doing CrossFit! They do absorb sweat but always need adjusting. Very disappointed!
1.0,It was to short the teeshirt was to small but to to short
1.0,I don't like spending my hard earned dollar on something that doesn't fit.  also it was super lightweight material and even a hole in armpit of one
1.0,They were really cute but 3 of them broke within an hour or two of wearing them
1.0,"Order a size or 2 larger ,  large looked like small"
1.0,Horrible shoes!! Don't buy
1.0,In this 100 piece bag there is NOT EVEN ONE “G”
1.0,This hat is nothing like it looks or advertised. It's cheap junk. It does not stand up in any way like it shows. It's flat felt. Pieces have gobs of glue all over and mine arrived with missing pieces.
1.0,It's Beautiful It is definitely not True to size I wear a 2x. I brought a 3x and it still is to small. It looks like the 3x is a Large Very Disappointed. It does go below my knee in length
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,It’s way to narrow and not wide enough
1.0,These weren’t over the knee. I’m 5’3” and these weren’t even close to above my knees.
1.0,It broke in one day as soon as the clip was used
1.0,They sent the wrong size . The insert was for the bigger shoes and they were jammed into a smaller size shoe . The sizes aren’t marked on the shoes . Very very dissatisfied . No quality control at all
1.0,"If you are wanting the green aviators, don't waste your time. The color of the lense is a see through grey/black color. Also the frames are very flimsy. Disappointed and returning."
1.0,I would've given this 5 stars if it weren't that the seam is off to the right side in the front. It looks like a first time seamstress made this where it looks fine on a hanger but on an actual person the whole thing is messed up. I'm really upset with this purchase. I got the right size and everything. I won't be purchasing from them again.
1.0,Very thin material and the XL I ordered was more like a M/L. Sent it back.
1.0,My product came without cord. I contacted amazon and they did not respond so I purchased one. The seller then sent one to me and it still doesn’t work. Happy Valentine’s Day - NOT
1.0,Horrible. Daughter felt that they felt like cardboard
1.0,"These are so cheap, the ears are just hot glued on it seemed. Would not buy again."
1.0,"Very tight, uncomfortable gloves. Warm they may be, but that’s useless if they are uncomfortable, as these are."
1.0,This broke on me after three days of wearing. I barely grazed it and the top part fell off.
1.0,Item was way to small to be a 3x.  Should have ordered a 5x instead.  Might have fit my nephew.  He was so bummed out.
1.0,Purchased for my husband read the reviews before purchasing and decided to purchase this item. He is extremely displeased with the product and definitely does not recommend. The do not stay in place and unfastens.
1.0,I try it on. It fits. I go to zip it up and the zipper splits.
1.0,The post on the back of the earrings are bent and cannot be fixed nor worn.
1.0,The sizes run so small. I am not able to wear this at all. Very disappointed
1.0,I don’t like this on me. The fabric is loose and not flattering
1.0,"Would not stay on! Repeatedly feel off my wrist, the first time I thought I didn’t “lock” it in place correctly. Nope! I made sure it popped in place, yet it feel off again right on the side walk and busted my screen!"
1.0,The lace was falling off when they came in... I had to glue it back on....
1.0,That it was cheap!
1.0,It wasnt the right color im so mad 😤😠😡
1.0,Fits so weird!
1.0,I purchased this but it came with no remote to change color
1.0,Don't buy this dress! I got the light blue one and it's see-through. The proportions are all wrong and the quality of the fabric is just sad.
1.0,"It fit great (i had a small), but the dress runs small also i’d say. Good quality but totally see through so I had to return. I wish I wasn’t because I really liked it"
1.0,The colors in the picture did not match what I received. There were more purple hairnets than any other colors. & they were all different sizes most were too small.
1.0,Returned these and went back to my camo web belt with the metal buckle. Plastic buckles just aren't as strong and can't stay closed even when I'm not wearing them.
1.0,Screws came out after only 2 wears.
1.0,"So first, this is not COVID safe because the exhaust is not filtered.  Still good for wildfire smoke by itself.  Could work for COVID if you combine with a bandana or add cloth to the exhaust port.<br /><br />I don’t know how all these other reviewers are using this thing because it is IMPOSSIBLE to put on.  The buttons on the strap fall off when stretched over the head, so I’m forced to fasten one side and attempt to attach the other three anchor points afterwards, which is impossible without a mirror.<br /><br />Also, the styling of the studs makes it look like something you should keep in the bedroom.<br /><br />Comfy if you can get it on and easy to breathe through for me, but if you can’t wear it then what’s the point?  One star for use as an emergency handheld smoke filter."
1.0,Shirt was made smaller than you would expect in the size ordered.
1.0,It stopped working first day and glass cracked.not worth it
1.0,I was VERY disappointed with these earrings. The stones were spaced so far apart. Not at all like the picture showed.
1.0,Poorly made with a lot of extra string and the elastic on the pants was pretty tight
1.0,Came broken 😞
1.0,"Cheaply made. Not really wearable. Maybe for photos, but it all breaks and tears too easily."
1.0,This is a nice handbag however I purchased it in purple but it's really blue. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Fabric looks and feels cheap....white is more off white so the apron looks dirty.... very disappointed.
1.0,authentic dodgers jersey have front and rear numbers with player names this does not have a front number
1.0,"Just got these in the mail today. They are soo cute, unfortunately, I went to try them on and both earrings immediately fell apart in my hands. extremely disappointing!! Never even got them in my ears."
1.0,Material is of low quality and overall looks very cheap.  Looks nothing like on the model.
1.0,"This dress is cheaply made- the skirt seems to be attached backwards. The vertical seam that should be in the back is in the front and it looks terrible. The listing photo does not show that. The material is kind of thin, and the dress isn't as full as it appears in the photos. I don't think it is worth buying."
1.0,"Dress is not as show. I received the black one which I love, but the brown is almost an orange color. The straps are not as shown. More like a V neck tank top."
1.0,Wore once and the strap broke!
1.0,To small to have like 5 cards inside. Waste of money
1.0,Too BIG!  Size is incorrect
1.0,"Not as expected,  cloth thrown together, wears like a clown suit"
1.0,I am allergic to it
1.0,Turns green quickly and makes your nose itch!
1.0,Weird shape not like picture
1.0,"The metal on the waist looks awkward on the dress, nothing like the picture shown."
1.0,"Whoever made this doesn’t have boobs. The bra only goes halfway around the shirt!!!!! Guess what happens when it only goes halfway, it doesn’t work…at all. It’s extremely annoying to wear due to the lack of support but weird bra like item in the front that keeps floating around. Whoever is making these, please stop or accurately depict your product."
1.0,This is for kids
1.0,Awful quality. Did not fit.
1.0,"I read the reviews before I ordered and everyone said to size down, so I’m normally a L (size 12) and ordered a M. Well that dress wouldn’t even zip up, so I returned and I ordered a L. That dress did zip up, but I could hardly breath in it. I returned that one and got an XL. That one was still way too tight and also looked like it was used. It had a rip and a stain, so you guessed it....returning.  No way is a woman that wears a size 14 fitting in a L for this dress.  No. Way. I’m telling you this dress is not big or true to size. I’m wondering if it’s for juniors or something. Fabric is thick and the style is cute though. I really wanted to like this dress."
1.0,3?  that was the smallest 3X I ever saw.
1.0,Very cheap quality. I bought a pack of three back in June and a large hole has formed in the seam of all three pairs. Had to throw all of them away after only three months.
1.0,I bought these because they said thermal fleece lined- but there’s absolutely no fleece! Basically just another pair of regular yoga pants.
1.0,my son must have a fat head for a 3 month old
1.0,"You probably don’t want these. They are thin, shapeless (almost like a tube sock) and gigantic!! Definitely not with the money. I returned these and appreciate Amazon’s refund policy."
1.0,Product run really small
1.0,Nice hat but was shipped in a bag .and it got all creased .why would you ship a had in a bag not a box.
1.0,The product handle is sprayed painted and some areas not painted properly.  Coupled with that the product is poor in quality.
1.0,Not even close to the picture. You can find better quality at Dollar Quarter Tree
1.0,"Come on now, why not be accurate in the listing? When a pair of pants that are elasticized are so small yet I can tell just holding them up that I don’t have any chance of even getting them on at all… and I sized up even bigger than suggested.<br /><br />I live in a rural area where it’s a pain to send stuff back. I was excited to get these too."
1.0,"Im M, but ordered XL because i wanted it look baggy. But front of the shirt was so short its barely touches jean belt. Disappointed"
1.0,Not adjustable poor fit
1.0,Broke as I put it on. Sent it back and they never scanned so I ended up getting charged for something I sent back! THUMBS DOWN xxx 100!
1.0,To Small ...not enough room 4 a cell phoNe
1.0,"Run very small, like kid or petite sz...will not but again"
1.0,Horrible quality. Never wore it and the sewing is coming loose. Super see through. Save your money!
1.0,This is a tiny one it's supposed to be alot bigger.
1.0,"Looked inexpensive & flimsy. Textile snagged at the touch. Not a good combo, all around."
1.0,"I regret buying this product. The muffs are huge! And they are very flat! They are huge, fuzzy flaps that cover the sides of your head. It looks like a big black frame around ones head. When I weqr them I am reminded of the blinders they put on horses.  They look mildly comical when worn. I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"Thin material, pretty much see through. Arrived in ball, it's a wrinkled mess. I have it away for a oInt shirt for my friends kids. Highly disappointed."
1.0,"This is a cool looking watch, however, that is where my praise stops. The first one I received didn't work right out of the box. The replacement worked great for about six weeks then the winding mechanism stopped doing it's thing. Boshiya said they will send me a new one after jumping through some hoops. Buyer beware..."
1.0,This product is posted as 100% cotton. It is 95% polyester and 5% cotton. Purposefully deceptive. I am extremely disappointed. Polyester is woven plastic and a non-breathable fabric. Shameful.
1.0,"I've always had a huge head and most hats just barely fit me or won't go on my head. Sadly this had is very mislabeled. I don't know if they wanted to avoid being offensive or PC but this hat bill alone covered my entire face. I pulled it out of the box and didn't even have to adjust it, it went on and I started laughing. This hat is not for guys with big heads, this hat is for people with (for whatever reason) up to a 3 extra large size head or more. IT IS HUGE!"
1.0,The pendent itself was not made of good quality material. It was way smaller than what i expected it to be. Frankly i think this pendent is bad luck. I think i threw it away.
1.0,I really liked this bag until the zipper broke. Now it's totally useless and I'll have to buy a different one.
1.0,Cheap thin and useless
1.0,This belt is very stiff and after wearing about 5 times and is already torn on the inside. It's a really cheap belt and I can't recommend it. I will return it.......
1.0,This is very cheesy and nothing that I would wear
1.0,This is not the right order. False advertisement!!!!! Just regular jogging pants.
1.0,Complete scam they were NOT children’s gloves and just had a fake sticker! Don’t bother ordering anything from this seller! I had planned a very special gardening session with my newly adopted daughter and it was ruined!
1.0,Ouch.
1.0,I ordered navy blue.  I got black!!!  Really?
1.0,clothes are not good
1.0,Incomplete order received 5 when the order was for 60 pluse pouches to save them in well did not receive pouches either scam
1.0,Did not stick for long. Peeled up on corners. Would not buy again
1.0,"I purchased : color4 scarf ( birds). The listing clearly states that this is a silk scarf;  polyester is not mentioned in the item description. The tag on the scarf, that I received  states “100% Silk Feeling Fabric Polyester”. I will be returning the scarf.  If I had wanted a polyester scarf, that is what I would have purchased. This was a waste of my time."
1.0,"Was not pleased with this one.  I understood from the get-go that the fan would only power on when direct sun was hitting the top of the hat, which was fine - the problem is, the fan has NO wind power to speak of, it may as well not even be spinning.  Putting your hand directly in front of it was the only way to even detect a tiny push of air.  Add to that the hole for the fan on the brim means you'll be getting sun right in your eyes if facing in that direction.  While the novelty is there, the lack of useful function meant I ended up returning it."
1.0,Way too small said true to size and that is a lie was very disappointed because i needed it for a special occasion ended up having to change my whole outfit.
1.0,Don't work well
1.0,"Though this watch had the functions I needed for refereeing soccer, it started to fog up during my first game and the characters also faded.  Not a good sign for a watch advertised as a sports watch when it can’t get wet at all."
1.0,The shades look nice just not attended for a lot of sun. Finally wore the shades and after the first time they fail apart from poor workmanship.
1.0,"The green isn’t even close to the picture used for advertising and really neither is the style of the dress mainly the bottom. The fabric is very cheap and extremely thin. The entire dress is completely see-through. Also, you can’t return it. When I tried I had to print a label and was expected to pay shipping. I was willing to do so until I took it to UPS and they told it would be $150 to ship it back because it was going to China! . UPS told me this is a scam that happens a lot to Amazon customers so be careful when purchasing from a third party vendor. The vendor is making me jump through hoop after hoop to get a refund and they just offered me a $7 refund thinking that would be acceptable. I don’t recommend buying from this vendor."
1.0,Doesn’t keep time!!
1.0,"Cheaply made, sized incorrectly."
1.0,"I ordered 2 of this shirt with different colors, both XXL. The green one came loose and baggy as expected for an XXL. The blue one came so tight, I couldn’t squeeze into the shirt. I returned the blue shirt and ordered a replacement. Once the replacement was received, I tried it on immediately and this time it is larger, but still probably only Large (even though the shirt is clearly labeled as XXL.) So, if you are ordering this shirt, just remember the sizing is a joke, and be prepared to return ."
1.0,So I have not had this a year yet and its already falling apart. I need a full refund and or a replacement.  Why are you selling poorly made charms. Highly Highly unacceptable!!!
1.0,Sleeves don't fit even though the dress does. Disappointed.
1.0,They definitely are NOT curved. And not meant for eyebrows. Definitely a waste of money
1.0,"So, so, so thin. Too thin, retuned it immediately."
1.0,Horrible... While the length n size is accurate you can't wear it anywhere...the material is thin and see through also the stitch work is awful....I'm requesting a return/refund now....
1.0,These are NOT tunnels!!!
1.0,Material is poor... hard to wear without thinking it's going to tear off your feet
1.0,"Does not stay hooked, falls off"
1.0,Quality this to bad
1.0,Pictures do not compare to the size of the bag i actually  go.... awful!!!! Extremely misleading!!!! If i wanted a small purse i woulf of ordered one... i didnt... disappointed to say the extreme least
1.0,Missing item
1.0,"This suit came first. (I ordered 2  same company.). The fit was too large and somewhat &#34;gappy&#34;.  I didn't bother to return it because of the cost.  I wish I had returned it. When the second suit came - it was delayed, the fit was awesome and flattering.  Big difference for about a $4 cost difference."
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt. More like a solid T shirt material in the body with completely Different thinner slippery Polyester type fabric in the arms.  Did not like the look or the feel of it. I think it's likely a cheaper knock off to what is in the photo.  I took it out and put it right back into the bag for return.
1.0,"I kept trying to order the one listed as ""ZIGGY"" but I kept receiving the flag pattern in error."
1.0,It is not what you expect I ordered a set so that my wife and I could be matching it only came with one pajama don't understand how that works it is not worth the $50 is dollars that I spent on it
1.0,its just pure plastic<br />i got swety waring it for like 2minutes<br />moral of the story DON'T BUY THIS
1.0,The jewels are not in proper order
1.0,Not a good back. The threads started raveling in no time and a it got a rip after I put my charge phone and water bottle in the bag.

1.0,They came broken sent back.
1.0,"Que era mi size, pero no me quedó."
1.0,Couldn’t put together because of the threads in screws .
1.0,Would not recommend buying. Would not zip up. Was too small
1.0,"I liked the way this bag looks but I didn’t like that I found a used face mask in one of the pockets, it was supposed to be a new bag as well. For that I gave a 1 star rating."
1.0,I’m really disappointed in my purchase.  My luggage broke the first trip.  I have other luggage that is still intact. I bought these because I wanted a new set.  Waste of money.
1.0,It was valentine day gift its a nice watch but the image shows a bracket that does not come with it
1.0,"i want to like these, but the laces started coming apart within a week of use."
1.0,"Everybody said to order 1 size up and I did that, and they were still so tiny.  Normally size small works, so I ordered medium, but should've gone large or XL."
1.0,Recieved one... didn't work.<br />Returned.<br />Second watch lost 5 minutes per hour.<br />Both watches could not adjust band.<br />Going to ask for money back
1.0,Ever!

1.0,"First time I wore it, one of the pendants came off"
1.0,"These nose rings are cheap garbage. Got them for my girlfriend won't stay in, the cubic zirconium stud falls out, overall they're too small. I regret buying these."
1.0,broke in 1 day
1.0,very thin clingy unattractive
1.0,The item color is way off. They look more grey than blue. Not what I was looking for at all.
1.0,To long. Draging on the floor.
1.0,"This watch is cheaply made, though you can’t complain with the price range. However, the band broke within 24 hours of use, which is unacceptable."
1.0,Very disappointed with the product .<br />My kid 4 year old doesn't fit . Very big and doesnt fit at all.<br />Bad choice of buying this product.<br />I don't recommend for kids below 5 and below five
1.0,This lasted one month before getting really gross and tarnished. Would not recommend or buy again.
1.0,Nooo!!!! Material is so cheap can rip easily
1.0,"So, I have a 6 year old and a 5 year old. I bought the 5-7 gloves and they are SUCH a pain to put on... I have to help each child with EVERY SINGLE finger. Since the gloves are two layers that are not sewn together at the tips, I have to wiggle the outer part over the inner part for each finger every time they put on the gloves. I would return these if they weren't already worn once. They are very warm and sturdy, but simply not functional."
1.0,Broke after 1 day.
1.0,"This has no support and would be better suited for someone who either has a smaller cupsize or perfectly perky breasts. The shell cups literally lay right atop your nipples. Also arrived pink, not as pictured white in the photo! avoid"
1.0,Wore it once and broke within a hour! Super cute purse but poor quality. Sad it’s broken.
1.0,It dies not fit true to size  returned it
1.0,"These were three child-sized masks that were cut out of a single piece of t-shirt like material, not as pictured. There are no seams, or hems, it is loose ragged material and not cut properly as there were tattered edges, it smells unsavory. I would not want to put this on my face.<br />Edit: amazon hid this review due to 'sensitivity', so I toned it down."
1.0,They are HUGE and get too heavy.
1.0,"after a few hours of use the ears of the reindeer fall from the glass, I am using and liking, but it has this defect, I advise them to buy, but do not open the window during use"
1.0,The lents keep falling 😡
1.0,"Don't buy these! They are extremely thin, which would be great IF they would hold the heat. Didn't keep my feet warm at all. VERY POOR socks."
1.0,"Too small, no stretch."
1.0,"I had to scan and translate the sticker on the back of these. They are 75% Acrylic, 20% Nylon and 5% spandex. There is no merino anywhere in them. They are thick, but I absolutely hate acrylic, it pills quickly and looks worn out far too fast."
1.0,The shirt was way to small and so was the skirt
1.0,5xl Fits like a medium/large
1.0,"I received this product on March 27, 2021 and have worn them a couple of times and noticed will putting them on two flaws in the fabric at the lower legs."
1.0,Way too small and it says it’s an XL
1.0,I will be returning this. The torso is way too long. I’m 5’7” and I feel like if I was maybe 6’ this would fit right. So if you are really tall get this otherwise don’t bother.
1.0,The earrings came in the package all bended up and I tried to salvage them. But it looks like a cheap wire was soldered onto the metal-like fan. They are also quite heavy and the wire for the ear part just looks bad. Quite disappointed as they were supposed to be a gift.
1.0,"This chain arrived with the clasp detached form the chain. I noticed another reviewer had a similar problem.  I was willing to give the seller a chance to make this right, but when they wanted me to pay return postage, well I don't<br />think 'right' is in there blood.  My feeling is that alot of reviewers received this chain in working order but<br />judging from how mine was put together it's just a matter of time before they're clasp falls off as well.  I was going to use it to hold my wedding band from my deceased wife.  Imagine how I would of felt if this thing had broken and I had lost the ring. Anyway, beware this item, and beware this seller."
1.0,Extremely small for a child. I would not recommend.
1.0,The little bands were broken and the whole thing is very cheap.  I donated it to the poor - would not give this as a gift EVER!
1.0,This product was unacceptable as the fabric was then and it was extremely small according to size.
1.0,Battery was dead out of the box.
1.0,"Lasted one day and the leather separated (top & bottom). Rather than send it back and deal with that hassle, I used clear shoe goo to repair.<br /><br />Save your $."
1.0,I was sent the wrong size and wasn’t sent the toddler size but a size 6 in little girls not toddler. The quality of these are fantastic and they are made really well but unfortunately we’re way to big. They feature a nice leather cherry and the bottom of the shoes are tan and have a small amount of cushioning. The bottom has a little traction.
1.0,Watch is cheap looking and the pin that held the buckle on broke after one short wear. Bad choice
1.0,"NONONONOOOOO! COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH! found these on one of those &#34;awesome products on amazon&#34;, but im sending back!!"
1.0,Cheap fabric and different colors.
1.0,"These were super cute, but unfortunately caused me to have an allergic reaction. It claims to be sterling silver but I broke out in hives behind my ears and down my neck :( for that, I give it 1 star:("
1.0,Do not purchase
1.0,Totally the wrong color for Tiger Stripe camo.
1.0,This is not a true 3X not happy
1.0,"Got broken once i put in my finger, unfortunately...but I broke and I threw the envelope, I do not think I could send it back"
1.0,"Ordered large, got XL and it was still too small."
1.0,runs extremely small. the fit is not wide legged or baggy. I wear a womens 10 and ordered the XL it fit slim.
1.0,cheap looking & feeling.. returned
1.0,This is a waste of my time and money. The watch did not work at all. I think Amazon should not sell these watches. I bought 3 of them and none of them works.
1.0,Broke when I put them on.
1.0,Absolute garbage the bill was twisted it doesn't fit right tho it's large enough and the stick was cockeyed
1.0,"Only looks goog on screen, but it is totally useless"
1.0,"I guess I should have known these were REALLY cheap from the get go. $20 for a hoodie is a steal. As soon as I felt it, I knew it was low quality. Then I pulled it over my head to try it on, and ripped the pocket on the way down. As easy as that. Like it was waiting to come apart at the seams. So buy with caution."
1.0,"I am ALL ABOUT some big, gaudy, maybe even tacky sunglasses. These, however don't hit the mark. They are actually flat, not curved like most are. It's almost like they are those little kid dress up glasses from the store in those kits. I thought it was just me, but I've put them on many different people and they just aren't &#34;right&#34;. Just don't do it."
1.0,terrible quality/fit. don't waste your time and money
1.0,Nunca llevo
1.0,Not usefull for small size girls.. Im small size (24/26 jeans) and it doesnt feel tight at all. :(
1.0,They seem smaller than their size posted. Also if you have a high arc...these are not the shoes for you.
1.0,My daughter looks great in them lol
1.0,Material was very inexpensive
1.0,I purchased this thinking it would last longer than my previous one. This band lasted a week before it started to come undone at clip where you remove the band. Now it comes unclipped almost once or twice a day
1.0,"When I received these slippers I was very happy. After wearing them for about a week they were broken in and very comfortable.Had I written a review at that time I would haven given them a 5 star rating.  I'm glad I waited It has now been 3 months, 14 days and they are falling apart. Yes is do wear them every night for a few hours but they should have last more than a few months."
1.0,Nice looking but only lasted 6 months before metal hinge broke. Not repairable. Would not buy again
1.0,"Too small and it's my normal size. I ordered other products, same size and they fit fine."
1.0,"I actually posted a 5-star review because I liked the fit and the material seemed nice. Well now I've thrown them in the wash and the stitching is already coming apart! On both pairs! The washer was on cold and delicate with like fabrics so there's no justifiable reason for this. Not only that but I noticed a slight itchiness when I put them on straight out of the package. At the time I chocked it up to packaging or whatever because that happens with a lot of clothing, even premium brands like Calvin Klein. After a wash though, the itch had not gone away. After wearing them for a few hours it got to the point of being unbearable. Despite the cold and gentle setting, the black color bled into the white trim in a really dingy way. The black is definitely grayer than before the wash. That makes me think that the dye isn't being properly set in the material.<br /><br />Honestly this kind of bait and switch reminds me of Wish.com where everything looks good online, but is such poor quality they cant handle even gentle washing. What a waste of money"
1.0,I don’t like the way this fits. Feels like I put on a tent. I took out the elastic part. It fits a little better but wear a tshirt with it.
1.0,"The dress is a mess. First the sizing is incorrect, I ordered one my true size and one a size up. I have petite top measurements and this was way too tight. It was difficult to get off in either size for this reason. The fabric is not the quality you’d assume from the picture. The white fabric is no better than the skin hugging cheap fabric used to make built in slips under sheer fabric dresses. The black fabric was as expected and also sheer. I felt this was a Jackie O inspired structured underlay from the pictures and it was not. I could literally pull any dress off the rack at a discount store and walk away with a better quality item. Not worth the price nor the burden of having to process a return to go along with the disappointment."
1.0,Pretty when it is not on but WAY too small. Returning.
1.0,RECEIVED DIFFERENT ITEM
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:72dde1f94bd78ad5376c004f29a39ad2]] Zipper, broken. Bust area way too small, my areoles were popping out. Material is flimsy and not comfortable. This was bought in a size large and it did not fit like a large. Again, the bust is way too small. This dress is also very short! The seam came up under my butt cheeks. Please don’t waste your money on this, it is not worth it."
1.0,Too big and the one that did for turn my toe green within a few days. Cute for ring accessories though. Lol
1.0,This sweater began to fall apart after the first washing in cold water.  I will not buy again from this seller.
1.0,Does not hold onto chains as it should. Will not be able to use these as I had hoped.
1.0,I loved the band for a couple days until It broke.
1.0,"Cute but it breaks very easy, even if you do not use it"
1.0,"Looks great in the picture but it kept coming apart - and it's not like I was being very active or anything. I almost lost it twice. The cross just keeps coming out of the infinity sign and its so light that you cant even feel when it has come undone... I week after I wrote this, the chain broke. I really wanted to like this as it is do pretty in the picture, but it is cheaply made and just doesn't work if you are going to move around at all!"
1.0,"It is long, big and eeehhh!! I’m sending it back :("
1.0,not durable at all.
1.0,Very cheap designs and material
1.0,Soft and comfortable BUT within one hour the whole butt end ripped open.  Not along a seam but the whole fabric separated.  Thank goodness they were being worn under a dress otherwise my whole fanny would be hanging out for the world to see.  That being said - I am returning that pair and giving them another chance by ordering a couple more pair in hopes I just got a faulty pair.  They look great under Lularoe Carly dress.  So it is one star for quality but I would give 5 for comfort and style - Does that make sense??
1.0,"These earrings were a gift and they immediately broke.  The recipient was able to repair them, but this was embarrassing."
1.0,Missing item in the package item was very sealed properly So I don't know what happened there
1.0,This was not even the dress i ordered this dress has so many spots on it i will never purchase ever again never
1.0,Horrible shorts!  Almost like “ onion skin” paper thin” very cheesy and wrinkly!
1.0,Smells old and its unfinished.
1.0,"One pair arrived with a hole in them and just a few weeks and a few wears later, the second pair also have a hole."
1.0,Do not waste your time!! The mask gets hot when battery is in. Did not come with battery had to pay an extra 12 dollars for two batteries. They were drained with in an hour. Poorly made piece of junk!!!
1.0,"This band is complete garbage. It doesn't line up well with the Surge, you can see gaps and uneven lines where the unit fits into the band. The screw holes do not match up with the unit. Unfortunately once it's installed there is no way to remove the band without breaking it. Otherwise I would return it."
1.0,Was a little on the small sign and falls mid-calf rather than full length like the picture
1.0,"If you are looking for a wooden watch band, this is not it! This is a pleather band that is supposed to look like wood."
1.0,"Personally, my body had a horrible reaction to this jewelry in specific. Not sure what it was about it, but i tried a few different rings in this set, and all made my nose very irritated and bleed constantly, and basically reversed the healing it had done. I switched to another brand of rings and cleaned/took care of the piercings and very soon after that it was like nothing ever happened."
1.0,Didn't care for how the chain attached to the pendant
1.0,"Cheap, you get what you pay for.  Lenses had scratches and they were totally plastic."
1.0,"The belt I ordered says it fits up to 46"". I have a 42"" waist and this belt is too small. I measured from the ratchet to the last tooth and it's only 41"" long. Hopefully they just sent the wrong size. will try for a exchange and update if the new one fits."
1.0,Has only one short. 3 pack has one short
1.0,"Bought this for my 12 year old daughter...It broke the first day she tried to wear it! Not satisfied at all. I know it was inexpensive, but I was thinking it would a least last a few months..."
1.0,Moves around alot doesn't work very well
1.0,Too small from the chest and the material is very thin and see through. I do not recommend unless you want averything literally showing. I am 5.2 118 pounds. This dress would probably fit a 13 year old girl to put it into perspective in size. Sorry ladies I can't take a picture because 9f what I have said.
1.0,I was excited about this suit! Very cute style but fabric is weird! Reminds me 1970’s polyester.  Runs small and stretches weird.  I returned it.
1.0,Broke second time wearing.  They look nice but quality is very lacking.
1.0,I knew this couldn't be very substantial since it was so cheap. But it was put together with side seams on the inside and the shoulder seams on the outside. I will be returning it.
1.0,"I know the dress looks cute in the photo, but don't be fooled.  The dress is very short and I'm 5'6&#34;.  It barely covers my bum and does not look like the photo.  It's very see through."
1.0,I ordered twice two different sizes and neither one fit stop making your clothes so small!!!
1.0,This hat didn't fit properly.  I hate it.  Don't buy.
1.0,"Ordered this product a week ago, did not arrive within two days or even set delivery which was today July 21st. No other tracking information has shown since July 15th. Quite disappointed, never had this problem with Prime.<br /><br />Finally got it today July 23rd, it looks beautiful but the material is cheaper than expected. It also arrived defective... pictures attached."
1.0,"Cheap fabric, it tore behind the button on the first day wearing it. 0/10 would not buy again. Spend the extra $5-$10 and get a Pacific Legends or Johari West shirt instead."
1.0,this is not made of wood! very bad quality
1.0,My package came empty..  Nothing inside  looks as no one sealed the envelope... so product just fell out.
1.0,The fabric is thin. Shrank two sizes after washing.  I would like to return them but don't think its possible now that the shirts have been washed.
1.0,"So, I wear Hanes x-temp shirts every day under my work shirts, and they look so good I will even wear them to grocery shopping etc as a stand alone shirt, love them.<br />Well, evidently I should have looked close before ordering, because they have two different versions of the x-temp shirts. The ones I am used to are 60% cotton 40% polyester, they are fantastic. Well I ordered these, and knew instantly that something was wrong. The shirts were see through when held up to light, felt very thin, and looked really big, with a stretched out neck. Also, the label on the neck is faded very and not the same as what I usually wear.<br />After trying it on, I'm definitely not wearing these even lounging around the house, they are absolutely garbage, look at the stretched out neck and just cheap appearance in general. I suppose it was part my fault for not looking super close before ordering, but why such a big quality and size difference, Hanes? Very disappointed, hopefully I can return these without a hassle."
1.0,Mids
1.0,The item I received was cheap and it cost be $17 to ship it back.
1.0,This watch band is poorly designed. It's a hassle to put on. The seller is fine: my stuff arrived on time and it's exactly as designed. This is just a terrible band.
1.0,"I ordered the navy blue version of this dress and it was great but this pink one was terrible! This dress was itchy, see-though, and about 3 inches shorter than the blue one even though I ordered the same size. I would recommend only taking a chance on the colors that are Prime eligible. I'll be returning this dress immediately."
1.0,"These are very lightweight hunter-green/cream/gold earrings. The earrings came nicely packaged with several replacement backs. You will need them the ones that came on the earrings simply slide right off. Cute for a look if you need them, but don’t expect much."
1.0,"Did not like the material. It is see through. Very thin fabric. Looks dull white. Not happy with it, returning it."
1.0,Broke the 1st time I wore them.
1.0,I got the Med. And it was extremely small so I ordered the Large at it is big on me.
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. Broke first wear—tassel came out and fell apart. You get what you pay for! Or better—you don’t get what you don’t pay for.
1.0,"I have bought these glasses multiple times over the years. They used to be great. Matte rubber feel glasses. This time when they came they were cheap feeling, not matte, not rubberized. One of the lenses was too small for the rim, and both pairs had glue stains.<br />These things are barely worth $0.50. Total trash."
1.0,Was not adult size
1.0,I’m so disappointed...  permanently wrinkled!<br />Pressing doesn’t help
1.0,The colors were switched when I got my order!!!!! It's b.s.
1.0,I've bought plenty of Vera Bradley items and this item is by far the cheapest looking knock off. Not happy at all with this.
1.0,Broken out of the package
1.0,The material is soft but the sizing is awful. The size large pants are huge and the size large top runs really small. Not a good purchase at all. Keep looking at a different brand
1.0,Its not even as good as a long sleeve shirt.<br />Don't waste money
1.0,These glasses are horrible they don’t block the glare at all. A waste of money
1.0,"HORRIBLE! Save your money! Ended up having to use my fingers for guidance. Needle got stuck on the tool causing unnecessary pain and discomfort for my client. I never got the chance to use it on myself, and I NEVER WILL USE THIS TOOL ON MY CUSTOMERS again!"
1.0,"I wasn't sure if I should order based on my waist size or my weight so I ordered two sizes.  The first size was based on my waist size and then I ordered another pair in the next size up, which got closer to my weight.  The pants that were based on my waist size were way too tight.  The size up was only slightly better but still way too tight.  If I go up another size then I'll have too much fabric in the knees.  That all being said, I have curves so if you don't have much in the way of curves, these might work for you.  They are also paper thin so you will be able to see everything underneath.  Just not for me.  The style is cute but they only work for a specific body type."
1.0,"I bought this to use to travel with the controller and store the cables in my backpack. The problem with it is that he controller doesn't sit deep enough in the case to close it. When you put the charging cable and the chromecast in it, it barely closes and you have to smash everything down to get it to close. Also I bought the stadia claw to play on the road and also tried storing it with the controller and cables. You can pretty much forget about the claw fitting in the case with the cables and controller. This case does NOT properly fit the controller and its components due to design flaw. Recommend that company redesigns case and make the bottom part deeper to fit and close properly. Case has been returned to Amazon."
1.0,Gloves were too big and touch screen did not work.
1.0,Dont waste ur time
1.0,Ripped within the first two weeks. They feel great out of the package but they lack quality.
1.0,The fit is horrible. Neck and sleeves are way too big. Sorry I wasted $29 on a T shirt
1.0,These are a terrible purchase and I strongly advise against. They shrank to about half their original size the first time I washed them. I am returning them immediately.
1.0,Pro: Great for one wear...<br />Con: changed as soon as I washed.. didn't last me a month. Found hole after washed. Material too thin. 🤷‍♀️
1.0,Disappointed with the material & how it fits waste of money
1.0,"The jacket came with the zipper broken. It was a gift to my daughter. We tried to fixed it, but it is being hard"
1.0,"The material is very thin. The rayon as well is thin. The studs aren't studs, they are thin cheap metal looks like it's about to fall off."
1.0,Super cheap quality earrings. I wound up returning them to Amazon. They were flimsy and not made of a very good quality. I would not recommend wasting your money.
1.0,Didn't fit my regular size key!! Too small
1.0,"This bra did not do the job. I am a size 6 and have some back fat that needed to be minimized. Unfortunately, this bra did not hide the back fat. In fact, it made my back look weird under my tshirt. Try another bra because this one doesn’t work!"
1.0,Don't go by the chart
1.0,Looks cheap and ugly. Wouldn't recommend
1.0,Came with mark on the collar
1.0,Didn’t look good with clothes on. Could see the outline
1.0,"PROS:<br />>> Product shipped and arrived quickly<br />>> Seller was very responsive, courteous, kind, and helpful when issuing my refund, as I ended up needing<br /><br />CONS:<br />>> Strap is very, very low quality<br />>> VERY STIFF, INFLEXIBLE strap.  It's as if it's two thin pieces of nylon glued on top of one another, and the glue inside the entire length of the strap keeps this strap from bending or flexing in any way that would accommodate comfortably wearing it on one's wrist.<br />>> The zulu rings (the rings that keep the ""tail"" of the watch band in place once it's on one's wrist) were partially glued to the band itself in their little ring holes, due to sloppy gluing of the product<br />>> The ends of the bands where the watch pins reside are too large and spacious, which makes putting on this watch band very difficult, as the pins slide all over when trying to put this band on one's watch<br />>> The color of the orange band I purchased showed a ""normal"", bright orange hue, but the band received was a faded, muted salmon color<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />The seller himself seems like a nice guy.  Unfortunately, however, the product provided is incredibly low quality."
1.0,"Cheap fabric, ugly pattern, does not fall properly, hangs down in the front.  Colors are off.  I returned it."
1.0,The sizing on this skirt is really small.  I wear an 8 and a medium was very tight on me.  I did like the material but had to send it back
1.0,Prefect for hulk no for me!!!
1.0,"This one is just a fade.<br />It works, but the fan is totally wrongly positioned and gives practically no, or very very little draft of air to the face, mostly to the nose only...<br />I can not recommend this cap unless looking somewhat ridiculous is your thing...<br />Hugs..."
1.0,I’m so dissatisfied with this product! The buckle completely broke off on the piece that goes into the belt hole! It’s a cool concept for a belt and looked like it was made well but it obviously wasn’t! The zipper part is very small and hard to hold much of anything in there. You can fit a few dollar bills and that’s about it. It runs true to size.
1.0,"fell apart after one week, loops fell out of knot.  I like style but how it is put together is NO good."
1.0,Very bad quality and stitches shows everywhere. It was a hassle trying to return it. Seller said I will get refunded. I have to check to make sure.
1.0,Cheepy
1.0,"After two days of being on a keychain with just car keys, the middle part broke off and now it's hollow in the middle. Bought as a gift for someone and I'm very dissapointed it's THAT fragile it couldn't even last a month at least or something."
1.0,I really like this shirt but it didn't fit me and I had to return it.
1.0,Gift for my mother in law and she stated she clasped the bracelet went out to lunch and it must have fallen off. The fit was the right size but clasp is not secure.
1.0,Good quality materials but poor workmanship. Inner fleece layer rips off the outer layer if you pull the cap to cover your ears. This was an absolute waste.
1.0,"Does not fit the same as it looks on pictures. Comes really baggy, not form fitting. And the leg cuffs are not elastic and do not press against your legs."
1.0,Terrible sizing
1.0,It should fit well if you're 85 lbs.
1.0,Fell apart in less than a week
1.0,This item arrived broken and requiring you to try to fix. Tried fixing but got frustrated and returned it. It is huge and not very durable.
1.0,"Says ""Plugs""  but then only one plug shows up. Pure bologna. Tricky wording. Not cool. Do not recomend buying."
1.0,"thin, awful"
1.0,"Sent back 2 weeks ago, no refund….not cool."
1.0,"Suspenders would not stay attached to son’s pants for wedding.  Had to pin them right before.  Super cute, but had to constantly reclip & then pin."
1.0,All 4 pairs are in the trash in less than a week. Wore them.once and the back that snaps them close broke off
1.0,"When I received these bangles serveral had the cabachon setting not fully attached, one was missing an end. Then when working with the bracelets several more broke. I should not have to repair something that is brand new.<br /><br />Do not buy!"
1.0,"I ordered two packets, one for each of my sons. Both packets had an issue. The first packet had two different size bottom and top. The second packet included a bottom with a huge hole on the side. The worst part is that I noticed this when we were on our ski trip and needed to wear them. If not, I’d returned both items. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"This is my second one, neither will not stay on my bracelet. It was locked and it keep opening and falling off my bracelet. Do not buy !!"
1.0,This product is not for me!! Now they may work for some... Maybe my nose is a tad bit too big but these nose studs are tiny and barely noticeable... The L shape is too short so they easily slip out as well...the little diamond chip is so small and the metal not good quality it seems to fade and lose its glitz and shine almost immediately!! Disappointed because I have so many of them which I will never use...!!! Bummed!!
1.0,Nosepiece bent. Crooked on face
1.0,Too long. Up to new low the knee. I don’t want to be look like. Grandma.
1.0,This necklace broke within 10 minutes of putting it on for the first time and wearing it around my house before I left.
1.0,I normally wear at 34 B. I ordered the B cup and it was too small. You almost need one or two cups bigger. I question how useful the underwire is but hard to tell since it doesn’t fit properly. It seems pretty sticky but because it’s too small it pulls off the skin nearest to where the clasp is. Very disappointed and don’t want to bother with sending it back in. Guess I won’t be saving money after all... :(
1.0,Don’t buy. The design has swastikas.
1.0,Way too small and I ordered a size up.
1.0,This is so cute and fit great but the whole back of the bottom unraveled the second time I wore it and only wore it to the pool as a cover up - didn't even wear it all day.  .
1.0,After a week it started peeling. Over $200 down the drain.
1.0,"I have 19.5"" calf and so got the size according to chart. I tried to put them in but couldn't because wouldn't stretch open enough around ankle area of socks. It was so tight there that I tried rolled and stretch it open to putin but wouldn't budge at all. Couldn't get my toes through it even. Waste of time and money."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c9595f9a3e036076a7c730e917dc491b]] Item was nothing like the pictures. It’s very sheer and it runs small
1.0,Didn’t like it<br />I donated
1.0,"they r not like this at all - they fit close to a sock - they fit my little 5 year old like this, not an adult - irritating !!!!!"
1.0,"Ordered a 2xl, looks to be a Small no way is it going to fit a plus size. Like the material of it and it’s cute on my teenage daughter"
1.0,way to small for me
1.0,"Washing the robe makes it shrink up almost two full sizes. The medium fit perfectly right out of the package, but now the sleeves are 3-inches too short, the shoulders are far too tight, and the belt sits well above my waistline. Total waste."
1.0,"Great concept, but the eyelets are made of thin plastic.  When I put the goggles on & tightened the bungee cords they broke.  Needed thicker plastic in the area or metal."
1.0,"These masks are cute and snug, but cute and snug does not equal safe. They do not have a filter which renders them useless for any type of protection."
1.0,This sweater is like tissue paper! It is so thin it does not hold it's shape.
1.0,Broke when I tired to put it on.
1.0,Washed the shorts upon arrival. Wore once. Not even working out or any physical activity was done while wearing them. Went to wash the second time and noticed the seam where the compression insert meets the shorts was ripped.
1.0,the size chart is not right by any means I ordered two extra large and you CAN  not get them around a two liter pop bottle let alone a human leg. WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,Absolute waste of money.  When it finally showed up it wasn't what was pictured.  It was extremely cheaply made like it was made out of twine.  Such a disappointment.
1.0,"No pockets, very cheap material. Not what was imagined"
1.0,Cheaply made.<br />Material tore easily<br />Threw in the garbage<br />Would never recommend to anyone
1.0,I was very unhappy with this i had it for a day or two and it broke & i only had 2 keys on it...
1.0,"Terrible quality, that’s that on that luv"
1.0,Fake watches. Don't buy...
1.0,I ordered the leopard kimono and received a romper that is very small and not true to size at all figured it was sent in error so notified amazon and they sent an incorrect item again.  Very upset is not the product in the picture is a romper about three sizes too small.
1.0,"Ordered this in the black with the cranes. The fit of the dress was true to the size chart and I was actually very happy with the fit of the dress. However, the skirt portion of the dress had been cut out of the fabric in such a way that very few birds were showing. The picture shows that the full skirt is full of birds all along the bottom portion but mine only had about three birds in a line across the middle of the skirt. Returned it."
1.0,This is extremely light weight and the band is very thin. It looks like It came from a 25 cent vending machine
1.0,"OK in size, but the material is like paper."
1.0,The chain broke the first day. It looks cheap and doesn't absorb the oil well
1.0,"Honestly , The second day I got this the chain broke so i had to connect it to a different piece of the bracalets. Two day later the whole thing broke . Would not recommend seems like it has high quality but trust me it doesn't"
1.0,When something says sweatshirt it shouldn’t be as thin as a T-shirt 👎👎
1.0,The arms are for kids. Don't even fit my wife
1.0,The strangest material. It fit strange too. Not what it looks like in pictures.
1.0,"Junk...clover is not real, just a painted fake one clover was also so far out of the bezel that this piece is unwearable, very disappointing...I cut the “clover” off, scrapped off all the hot glue mess and might glue it back on...still- piece of junk you will have better luck at a western store or a flea market"
1.0,No me agrado el producto
1.0,"It fits ok, but I ordered a fully lined lined coat but it was lined at all! Very disappointing."
1.0,"For it to properly stay up and not slide down I have to pull it over my ears.  If not, the part over the nose gets yanked on from the back and pulls it down.  I don't want to have to cover my ears all of the time.<br /><br />The filters are pure gimmick. If you actually put the filter against your mouth you will notice that it's almost impossible to suck air through it so of course when hanging loosely in front of your face the air will come through everywhere but the filter."
1.0,"i wore this for not even a month and it started falling apart at the seems, terrible product"
1.0,Not recomended. Bad quality
1.0,They do not work!
1.0,These are capris.  Not pants.
1.0,"It’s neither sparkling nor glittery. It’s just a pattern, but it makes a great ice pack holder!"
1.0,"First I received the product 2 weeks late after being told three different dates of delivery. When I received the item it was compressed to where it left creases in the shirt, especially the vinyl and the shirt was discolored badly."
1.0,Kinda looks like it came out of a gumball machine
1.0,"Horrible quality, and not at all what the picture looks like."
1.0,The quality of this jacket is awful! Plastic is the only word I can think of to describe it. Even the patches are plastic! Very misleading picture and item description. Do not order unless it is for a one time use such as a costume.
1.0,This was not what I thought it would be.  It was also broke when I received it.  I returned it
1.0,"Got this delivered last night for my husband, and I’m disappointed.  Fits okay, but the Bronco emblem in the advertised picture makes it look like the design is cut out in the blue, and you can see the underlying orange through the cutout, which is why I got it.  Nothing going to rub off, it was “designed” with the logo built in, you know- reliable for the money. NOT the case at all.  The band is flat all the way around, and the orange horse head is PAINTED on the outside of the blue band, no cut out - not according to the picture at all, completely different design than advertised/pictured.  Honestly, it’s a smart design for a company to make money, as the more it’s worn, the orange paint will crack and rub off and you’ll have to buy a new one.  If you paint silicone and your claim to fame is “flexibility”, not an intelligent design at all.  Pretty disappointed, as this was a gift, and now I’m going to have to get a different one from a different company that’s made better and more reliable.  From the price and the company, I was pretty let down by the false pictures.  If you’re purchasing this for a fan/super fan, highly recommend going elsewhere, as $25 for  a silicone ring you’ll have to replace frequently for someone who uses their hands a lot is going to be pricy.  Yes “lifetime guarantee”, but who wants to wait for a new one every few weeks?  I purchased this thinking it was going to be “tough” and reliable.  Bad purchase on my end, very unhappy."
1.0,Did not like the fit or fabric. May we return??
1.0,The top portion of the dress is too bulky.
1.0,Product is flimsy and not at all as pictured. The ring sits a totally different way on. Quality is not there at all. Ring is misshapen and missing stones.
1.0,"Fit terribly. Small looks like a large on me. Unless they got the size wrong. Very disappointed. The material is great. I’m 5’1 and 97 lbs so I’m small. I swim in this. The skirt is way too long. Down to my knee. The arms are holes are massive. Very, very disappointed."
1.0,"This dress looked so pretty in the ad. Loved the little birds print, plus nice natural fabric... then when it arrived I noticed that whoever sewed it flipped the cloth so that the print is the wrong way around! The birds are all upside down. Kind of a major oversight lol!"
1.0,"I liked the idea of the padding between my body and my duty belt. This belt might make it slightly better on my hip bones.  It is incredibly hot and holds heat in. I could see extended wear in the heat of summer causing rashes. It also shifts very easily causing me to have to find time and a place to get my duty belt off, drop my pants to readjust it. Although it is padding it somehow caused pain in my back while seated in the squad car. The belt also causes a lot of discomfort across my stomach. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who wears a duty belt."
1.0,"You have to be very careful when buying clothes from Amazon. Many of the shirts I have bought including this one have appeared to have some kind of a “brand” In the listing but if you look at the tagging in the shirt there is absolutely nothing, just a tiny tag with an M for medium and another label in the inseam that says made in China and maybe gives wash instructions.<br /><br />The shirts are not some designer brand, they look like some thing you could sew yourself if you bought a pattern and fabric. Who knows if this was made in a Chinese sweatshop? It also does not have any kind of a shape to it to make it more “fitted”.<br /><br />I am growing more and more leery of buying clothes on Amazon is there does not seem to be any kind of quality control or ethics review.<br /><br />Clothes are simply created by anyone in the world and then sold online at who knows what mark up. Lots of room for very bad ethics practices and as a consumer we cannot have any insight into what the manufacturer is doing with their resources and how they treat their employees.<br /><br />Going forward I’m going to buy from stores like Eddie Bauer, LLBean, Kohl’s, Target, etc online and purchase brands that I know about. We need to be more conscious as consumers and make sure that we only buy from clothing manufacturers who are ethical."
1.0,Just be aware there is a restocking fee if returned I lost out on about $10. Otherwise I think it was pretty good quality.
1.0,The push clip on string does not work right out the package so the bag will not stay sinched tight and closed
1.0,I ordered two rings.  Both size 8.  Got two size 6
1.0,"I gave this ring to my wife as a 40th anniversary present.  It was a big hit, she loved it. But three months after I gave it to her, the ring fell apart. We were fortunate in that it happened at home and I was able to find the ruby section of the ring. My wife was pretty upset, but I said no problem I will contact Gin & Grace and have them repair the ring. But after Gin & Grace kept me on hold for an afternoon, I finally disconnected from their website. A week later a bot of some kind told me I would have to go back to Amazon for repair since I purchased the ring through them. But that makes no sense, as I am not aware that Amazon has jewelers!  I have gone to Amazon, but of course they say I must contact Gin & Grace.  So be wary of purchasing Gin & Grace products as customer service is horrible.  So now what?!"
1.0,Would not stay in<br />Caused my hole to close
1.0,Ive bought better sunglasses at a dollar store.  The quality of these are way less then what it should be for the price that you pay for them.
1.0,Arrived so tangled I can’t wear it. Returning it.
1.0,Turn our arm green within an hour of wearing. SAD.
1.0,These did not hold up. They did not stay in my nose for even a minute before the magnet released.
1.0,"I like it, but too small! Gave to someone in need of a nice warm jacket! Should have gotten a x large!"
1.0,"Shirt was very wide when tried on, picture looks much slimmer. Had to take the whole thing in to look good."
1.0,Poor quality and much too lightweight to be a winter coat
1.0,"I ordered these glasses and they arrived on time. They are very cute and fun to wear. I got several compliments on them.  HOWEVER, I wore them for less than a month and they broke.  I only kept them in the case when they weren't being worn and I pretty much only wore them for driving so they didn't get a lot of use.  However, after about 3 weeks of wearing them, the plastic broke where the screw was near the bridge of the nose on both sides. They are now completely useless and a waste of money."
1.0,Im a size usa mens 38. One would need to get either a size 42/44 to be able to fit
1.0,This is not a jacket as described.  It is a long sleve shirt made out of thin blouse type material.  Ordered for my son to have a jacket for school but he can't even wear it because it is a shirt and he has a school uniform he has to wear.
1.0,It’s hard to clip on the mask. It’s extremely stiff and hurts your fingers a lot when trying to put it on the mask. I don’t recommend.
1.0,If I could leave a zero star review of this I would. I was so excited to get this necklace but within the week it tarnished and turned my neck green. Not worth it. Very cheap.
1.0,These were orange and footed tights. NOT ballet pink convertible tights!
1.0,"Disliked everything about them and now it looks like I’m not able to return them, so disappointing"
1.0,"First, the material felt like polyester and not some lightweight summer fabric.  Second, the 2XL was insultingly small - I don't know where those measurements came from, but this was an Asian sized 2XL if it was anything."
1.0,Cheaply made very disappointed
1.0,Item arrived broken. Very disappointed.
1.0,To tight around the legs
1.0,crap
1.0,Muy ancho
1.0,The pke meter was broken.
1.0,"In the description it says &#34;Fits 10 inch wrists&#34;, well the original large is 8.2in wrist size, so this should be 2 inches longer yes?<br /><br />No. It's like 1/4th of an inch longer. It's an absolute lie.<br /><br />Also the metal part that clips into the hole is horrible and takes way more effort than should be required, and then doesn't even sit very well."
1.0,Heavy on my ears. The minute I put them on my ears were so irritated and red. I returned them
1.0,Cheap material. Order a large I receive a juniors XS.
1.0,Way smaller than expected. A disappointment.
1.0,"This watch was way too big and the band isn't adjustable enough to fit properly on most people's wrists. If you want to buy a watch either go to a store and buy it there, or look at watches in the store than look up the model online. Don't buy a watch just because you think the picture looks good like I did."
1.0,I got the rainbow one and it just looks black. The top of it sticks out so it gets caught on everything and doesn’t look right at all. Very disappointed!!
1.0,"Maybe they sent the wrong ones, I'm not sure. But these did not fit my half jackets."
1.0,"I purchased these to make keepsakes for a production of The Little Mermaid.  I ordered them months ago and was very pleased by their appearance.  I packed them away and just pulled them out to make them for the actors.  I am so disappointed.  All ten of the red and gold mermaid tails are missing eye hooks, making them useless.  She here is no way o attach them to the keychains.  It's too late for a refund, so buyer beware."
1.0,Cheap material cut smaller than size. Blazer only not a suit
1.0,Definitely not the item pictured.<br />It is small and made out of a polyester material kind of like a shower curtain…not suitable for a bonnet of any type.
1.0,Lacks durability.
1.0,"Fits close to the breastbone well, but has no side support whatever!! I wore it once, so can't return, total loss of money!!"
1.0,"I have ordered these earrings three times previously. This time, they arrived with tarnished posts. This was a waste of 10$."
1.0,"muy malo el material, también es muy caliente"
1.0,This was way smaller than it said.  It was not even close to the size it was supposed to be.  I've never been so disappointed. Definitely a waste of money.
1.0,Was nothing like the pic. Very weird shaping to the dress.
1.0,DON'T BE FOOLED!!! WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,"Absolutely ridiculous! It arrived inside out, had mud on it noticeably, it smelled bad, AND I go to zip it up and the zipper busts off. There was a tear in the zipper. This thing looked like it has been used by the homeless for 1 month and returned. I am a FREQUENT Amazon user. This was bad!"
1.0,This product is nothing like it describes ..it fits like a large and I ordered a 3xl .I didn't realize it was coming from whatever Asian country took over a month to receive it.no way to return it either .Waste of money and time.
1.0,Did like the look but the watch worked for about a day and a half
1.0,10mm shorter and thinner than listed. Holes for buckle stretched and started to fray in a week. Might be good for lighter polycarbon type watches but not a good solid dive watch.
1.0,Not too good according to my expectations
1.0,"Thin material, way too small, very strange shape with gathered hemline making it impossible to walk. Picture is deceptive."
1.0,i got them they look nothing like the photo. and smell like chlorine
1.0,flimsy...weird directions for some blue light thingy with bad translation. Just a waste of money.
1.0,"Very disappointed, it looks nothing like the picture! Not even in the shape of a hat! Super pissed!"
1.0,Material super thin - could see through two layers. One sleeve was an inch longer than the other. Terrible quality. Definitely returning.
1.0,"I bought this watch to wear on a camping trip. It broke the first day I wore it. Very cheaply made. I tried to return it and discover they only allow 30 days. Worthless, cheap, piece of junk and a clear waste of money."
1.0,bought these for my boyfriend & let me just say they look nothing like the picture. don’t waste your money.
1.0,Terrible product. Cheaply made and looks horrible. Crooked and bent
1.0,"The breast pads I received were not in any way like the ones pictured. They were not contoured, they were the color fabric only, not a soft side for the skin, and no washing bag. The packaging and writing is from China and they are a cheap, horrible product. Truly disappointed."
1.0,This dress is ugly and cheap! Looks nothing like picture
1.0,"My son wears an XL shirt so he bought the hoodie in XL, when it arrived it was to small. He then bought a 3X and when it arrived was still to small (skin tight). The hoodies have no size labels on them so you really don't know what size you're getting (seems like a scam) NOT PLEASED!!!!"
1.0,The material is horrible and thr colour is sooo bright yellow totally throws you off I hate what was deliverd to me to what was advertised totally misleading.
1.0,The top is huge and cut weird. Poorly made
1.0,"When I got the product, it looked nothing like the image, except it was purple. The material looked like that felt-like stuff they give to kindergartners at arts & craft time. It even looked like a kindergartener had made it, then someone slapped on some fake plants they bought at a craft store and coverd it in hot-glue. OMG there was alot of hot-glue. I don't know if they were just in a rush because it was around Halloween when I ordered it, but I ended up having to make my own because the one I received was just so bad."
1.0,Too small could not get on
1.0,Worst underwear I've ever purchased.  They ride up over my bottom because there is no support in that part of the underwear.<br />I wish I could have returned them.  I still have some I never wore and will probably throw them away.
1.0,"Do not buy this, what a waste of money"
1.0,"Itchy, scratchy, see-through. Do not recommend at all."
1.0,Not Photochromic. Uncomfortable. And they fall off. They take forever to ship. I own quite a few sunglasses but these will be going into the trash. Do not buy.
1.0,"While this is really cute and has a nice fit, it is COMPLETELY seethrough, might as well not wear anything."
1.0,This Om symbol charm didn't even last a month before it broke from the lobster clasp and fell off wasting my money for nothing. Very disappointed!
1.0,It's a beautiful necklace: if only I could wear it. It arrived broken. The ropes were all broken off and so was the clips. Going to get a glut gun and fix it but by that time it would cost more than worth.
1.0,ribbing
1.0,"This top came in and it was 3 sizes too small and I ordered a large. The material was of poor quality, it felt heavy and cheap. The zipper was stuck and it just was over all just horrible:"
1.0,Wanted an oversize cover up for the pool as a gift for my niece.  My daughter has terry cloth cover ups and I searched for one I thought would feel like a towel; this was the opposite. It felt spikey and rough. It was like an old worn out towel that has been washed a million times and needed to be trashed.  Very disappointed!!  I have never bought a Lands End item before and I never will again
1.0,Soon as I took it out the package it came apart. Never worn.
1.0,"Sizing is WAY off. Cut is weird too. Really small on the rear end.  They ride super low, but just in the back.  And my hubby has no rear end to speak of, so much be way off. The pattern and material are great though. Too bad :("
1.0,Those were way too small. They were very pretty they just not the ideal size for a nose ring.
1.0,It look nothing like the picture fabric iss super cheap
1.0,"I am issuing a warning because they will not let you return these boots if they do not fit. Mine did not fit and now I am stuck with them. Even though when I ordered it it said it was returnable until January. It is not true, and I have lost $70. The one star is because of the return policy and not because of the boots"
1.0,The riverdale face mask said archile instead of Archie. Do not buy if you care about the spelling mistakes.
1.0,I all ready had purchased a pr of these exact sandles at a store and got small which were perfect fit so I ordered x small  and they are too big for me.
1.0,"I will NOT ever purchase these dresses again. They are super thin material and see through. They can now only be worn as a night gown. False advertisement at its finest. You can’t return them unless you pay shipping back to China. I’m not satisfied. The patterns are cute, but needs better material. The pictures show the dress being more flowy and loose fitting. These fit more as bodycon or form fitting dresses/night gowns."
1.0,"The worst product I have ever purchased, 2 of the zippers broke , One before I ever packed......The other while I was on vacation, Lesson learned I will never purchase luggage from you again. Zero Stars...."
1.0,"Washed it before wearing and it shrunk. Thank goodness I didn't place it in the dryer. Very thin sheer material, probably won't last weekly washings. Not worth the $14."
1.0,"Doesn't work, total waste of money. My friend also purchased and said it didn't work for her either."
1.0,Very much so a polyester feeling to it
1.0,failed during first day of wearing it. The material holding the buckle to the belt pulled though the single small screw that was holding it.
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it.  Thin and cheap.
1.0,"sweat pants don’t hug your curves, so it looks unflattering. and the top is oversized, not a crop.if you are smaller or shorter person this may look like a full jacket instead of a crop. don’t go a size up i would stick with your regular size. if you are a taller person this would probably look better in terms of fitting"
1.0,Fake not authentic PINK material felt like nylon & it was eaten up with small rat holes. Not made in the USA &#34;Do not buy PINK from here not real!!
1.0,Ordered twice and both the times I got defective pieces. It’s torn one side for both of the ear muffs.
1.0,Doesn’t fit my head as I would like. Slips up over my ears.
1.0,"Super cute and inexpensive, but I just found out from the company these contain BPA. Kids put glasses in their mouth and BPA is readily absorbed through the skin. Not worth the risk. I found RoShamBo glasses for babies and kids and they are free of BPA, phthalate, lead and latex and made in Italy. I originally purchased Knockarounds because they had made a non-toxic version for the Honest Company, but I guess the same can’t be said for their usual glasses."
1.0,"These bracelets are at least 8 inches!!! And that's without extender. I bought them because it said &#34;6.5 inches...&#34; My wrist is 6 inches and I can't wear bracelets more than 6.75 inches. So if you've got wrists over 7 inches or you like wearing your bracelets slipped over your hand all the time, these are cute enough. Oh, and one clasp was stuck shut, impossible to open, so only one bracelet would have been wearable even if I did have huge wrists!"
1.0,These shoes are made of very cheap material. When I bought them they came in a clear plastic bag. And the insole was already coming apart. Do not waste your money.
1.0,This comes two sizes too small!
1.0,0 Stars
1.0,Super cheap material. Never wore it.
1.0,They look nothing like the ones pictured.. The only blue on them are the laces.. Disappointed
1.0,Lehenga is fine but the other thing it's not soft. And I buy a Saree from here and that one damage . So sad
1.0,"At first i loved it, but then the drawstring part broke.. I was sad cause i honestly thought it was perfect."
1.0,The pants were too big and I got a size small. I’m 5’0 and weigh 115. I would have sent them back and got an extra small but they don’t make extra smalls.
1.0,Received as a gift last Christmas. It's early April and the whole side blew out of one of them.<br />Loved wearing these boots but should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.
1.0,Poor quality...can't even wear it!
1.0,"Very disappointed, this is pictured with a strap to tie under the chin.  This did not have a chin strap and therefore it's useless, as my granddaughter will just keep taking it off.<br /><br />Bad advertising!"
1.0,Don’t buy. Waste money.
1.0,"I tried this one and it worked and got fin, went to go out and dive the plastic zipper brook right of with very little effort. Had to change to another suit."
1.0,The band is of great quality but apparently the blue tooth s2 classic watch takes a different sized band than the 3G version that I have.  I feel it could have been more clearly written in the title but it is my fault for not catching this information in the fine print.  I researched this watch for a month before deciding on the 3g version and did not realize there was a difference in size as online it is not easy to tell.
1.0,THE MATERIAL IS VERY CHEAP. JUST DID NOT WORK
1.0,"Purchased this for a 2 yr old grandson and just saw the product when visiting. So disappointing, had I known it was so awful to touch I would have sent it back for a refund. It’s a very stiff scratchy polyester. If your child has any sensory issues this would be a nightmare. The overall quality just appears poor and the hat is poorly designed in fit. There is no way it could fit the age range suggested. Perhaps size 2-6"
1.0,Wore them twice and they broke
1.0,"They say that a picture is worth a thousand words and that is certainly the case here. While the material used for these pants is o.k. at best the worst part is definitely the workmanship. The stitching is all over the place. Literally. The picture that I m attaching is of one of the seams on the leg. Obviously, the stitching is not where it is supposed to be and is coming apart. I just got these today, so it's not like this is a problem from wear and tear. Very, very bad quality control. I'll never try this brand again."
1.0,"poor quality, fell apart after on for 1/2 hour."
1.0,"After the first wash, this sweatshirt had several pills that I was unable to remove. Poor quality"
1.0,"I purchased this watch, after a few months, the piece just flat out stopped working. So I contacted the company to repair the piece, bo problems there.<br />After a few weeks, I received the watch back, but it still didn't work.<br />So now, I send an email to the company stating that I now want a refund, and not a repair, because, obviously, now I don't trust the company to repair the piece.<br />The company responded by sending me a form letter with instructions on how to send back the watch for repair."
1.0,The color is what disappointed me first. In the pictures it looks off white or cream. It's a light canary yellow. Also it's much shorter and thinner than expected. This was for my birthday. I'm disappointed.
1.0,"Warning!!!!!!!!! is about returning the item not the garment itself. The garment is very light weight, appears comfortable and well crafted. I was going to return it because I never ordered it! I do not like flowery pattern prints on clothing. The dress cost 30.99. The cost to ship the item back to China is 28.00. DO THE MATH!!!!!! The funniest part about this order is that I did not order this dress. I'm still laughing..... Anyways, my experience with Amazon has always been positive.... I'll wear it around the house so no one can see the large printed flowers."
1.0,I have other xl Calvin cline polo shirts I've bought at costco and they all fit great<br />This one from getting thru amazon is too tight now after washing 2x in cold water n low dryer heat per instructions<br />Fits like a large plus it's shorter in length not much to work with tucking into my pants<br />If they sold an xxl I would try buying that to compensate for the shrinkage size
1.0,"This dress is so poorly made ! the slit goes all the way up and you can see your private area. I understand that is the style but the dress i received had the slit pretty much in the middle. It would of been so cute if it was made correctly. The slit was off and does not look like the picture. The fit was as expected, the problem was the slit being in the middle instead of the thigh."
1.0,Too.small even when buckle completely open
1.0,worst purchase. It looked nice the first day before the pins started dropping.
1.0,Size fits a regular 11 or 12 year old. Not sized for regular adult and I ordered XL
1.0,The biggest disappointment on this top was the quality.<br /><br />Stitching was horrible!<br />Material is some thin kind of cheese cloth.<br />The crochet between the pieces of cloth will come undone at first wash<br />You definitely will have to wear a top under it due how sheer it is<br />The picture is very misleading
1.0,"I had to return this bc it was way too small.. if you order this and are curvy be ready to show some butt. However if showing butt is what you are going for..then go for it. I ordered this and it barely covered my butt cheeks. and the materaial was very thin, it does not look like good quality"
1.0,"No me quedó, perdí mi dinero"
1.0,Ripped at the top of strap after 1st use. Total garbage
1.0,Does not fit as described (too thick) & silicone was torn at the pin attachment so easily would’ve torn & caused the watch to come off.
1.0,"This shirt looks basically nothing like the stock photo. It's made out of a weird, textured material that is see-through, and the printed flowers look awful. I thought it was going to be sophisticated and preppy, but it's really just frumpy and cheap-looking, like something you'd buy at a yard sale for 50 cents. I ordered two sizes up because I was worried it wouldn't fit. Even at two sizes up, this top BARELY hits my waistline! It's cut short like a belly shirt. Other than that, the cut is pretty boxy. The arm holes are huge, and when I lift my arms to shoulder level, you can see my entire bra. I would never wear this shirt, so I'm returning it."
1.0,Looks more like a little girls dress not ventage.
1.0,"very cheap looking . it fell apart in the box, i threw it away."
1.0,"Useless, slips down all the time. Not useful for skiing as a gator/facemask"
1.0,I had to order this twice. The first time it was too small even though I ordered a size up. The second time the zipper just fell apart.
1.0,Too small in waist yet fell off shoulders and chest (38 D so lack of chest not an issue.
1.0,"The quality was just meh.  I expected much more.  They lasted about a month and now they’re in the trash. No support at all, lost their shape immediately, more like a soled slipper than a boot."
1.0,"So.... I got home and was excited to open the package, but before I could take the necklace out a couple beads rolled out. I thought the seller was thoughtful and put it replacement beads just in case. But then I got to the actual necklace and realized i was very wrong indeed. The necklace was in a million pieces. It looks like a bear had tried to put it on its neck and got frustrated, pulled out all the links, and handed it to his gorilla friend to gnaw on it.<br /><br />I wasn't aware of the fact that the seller is IKEA and expects customers to assemble the necklace themselves.... :("
1.0,"Wore this out to dinner and loved how it fit and looked until the damn strap broke off while I had no bra on, it wasn't tight or anything!!!. Seriously so embarrassing!"
1.0,"Poor quality, way too small. Do not recommend"
1.0,This is EXTREMELY SMALL I’m normally a XL<br />TO 1XL. I Sized up as I always do with Halloween costumes. Couldn’t even get this over my head! Cost a fortune to send back and YES you pay return shipping! I highly advise against this.
1.0,"You cannot laser cut on this material because it unravels! Had to throw out after ONE wear.<br />Fits small and the side cutouts are much too high.<br />Even after cleaning, shipping wrinkles still prevalent."
1.0,It was way too small and ripped when it came off.  Very disappointed because it looked so nice!
1.0,"The material is very thin, which I mostly expected but it is much shorter than shown on the pictures and runs small!"
1.0,Didn’t have a pull string
1.0,Liked this watch - thought it was a good deal for the money - however after only two months the clasp broke and fell off. I tried contacting LIGE two times to ask if I could get a new clasp and they never even gave the courtesy of a response. I would have paid for the new clasp but they ignored me. Says a lot about a company.
1.0,Do not buy! The clutch is not white but green. Maybe I received the wrong item. I ordered it because of the white color and now I have a pale green clutch I hate. I feel so disappointed! I can't return it because I live outside the US and it's costly and complicated. I guess I will simply accept I lost my money.
1.0,I ordered these for a set of 5 year old kids. Impossible to wear as a gaiter or even as something like a headband. They are cheap but a serious waste of money. I ended up using them as wrist bands for them for tie dye day at school. Not worth the trouble to return them but I'd steer clear from this product in the future. Awful.
1.0,Loved the color the fit was not great not long enough even with the XL size I ordered
1.0,"Super uncomfortable, the stitching sticks out far on the inside of the shoe and feels like a huge bump rubbing your foot."
1.0,My son has never got to wear these because the rubber for the ears fell off the first time he put them on.
1.0,"Smelly socks, absolutely terrible, I never buy again, I was do my workout and my feet’s was burning so bad ... very disappointed.... it’s no cotton at all...."
1.0,"So disappointed.  As a PNW mama I see Bogs all the time, but I ordered these, as well as another pair, and the heal was falling apart after two days of mild wear by my toddler.  So disappointed.  Check out lone cone rain or muck boots-such better quality/half the price/just as cute.  Don't waste your money friends-bogs-at least the rainboot sort-are not what they used to be.<br /><br />Also wasn't paid to say this at all-just want to save y'all undue research/time/money.  They did refund me for the record, but if you don't want to deal with returns/time waste-go with lone cone!"
1.0,"It's so sad that the design is awesome, and it really highlights your physique, but the quality is awful. Cheap cheap cheap."
1.0,"It wasn't silver, it turned yellow and black, and my skin became irritated and itchy"
1.0,Way to small for youth...didn't fit 9 year old much less a 13 year old
1.0,"THIS IS A MATERNITY DRESS. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK 3 TIMES AS LARGE, BUY THIS DRESS."
1.0,"Compass and light didn't work on either unit. Contacted seller and the only response that I received was, ""ok""."
1.0,Details ARE not Precise ' waste of Money
1.0,Another one I did not recieve..🤔
1.0,I had to pay postage for return...not fair
1.0,We bought our item straight from their website and we did not get it from Amazon.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Cool design that mothers with boys will love<br /><br />Cons:<br />The shirt was this cheap thin material (which is not worth the price they are asking for)<br />Sizing chart provided was not correct<br />Terrible customer service
1.0,Flimsy and came broke. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"I only received one of the two items I ordered. I have contacted the seller and asked for a refund… will update once I get a response.<br /><br />The quality is nice, but I didn’t like the print of the yellow flower in person. It looked cheap and not elegant in terms of the print and pattern. Fabric was nice and the lace was good. They look large."
1.0,It’s cheap and blurry. Don’t waste your time.
1.0,"These pants are okay. I'm sure they're not super durable, but they look cool. I would like them even more if they had real pockets instead of these stupid fake ones. When did the clothing manufacturers of the world decide that women don't want real pockets? Because we DO! I would have ordered the same pants in different prints if they had real pockets."
1.0,"Man, I wish that were true to size but noooooo!"
1.0,Do not order!its been two months no hat!
1.0,Fits nowhere right
1.0,"The zipper on these pants does not appear that it would withstand normal use.  And now the Fly zipper no longer functions.  When you get these pants, you can compare them to other products, and you will notice how small the zipper is- like it was made for a purse or a pocket-not the fly of your pants.  But wearing them out in public with your zipper down on the front of your pants still attracts unnecessary attention even during a pandemic.  I'd just as soon as have these defective pants exchanged for another pair of these pants (I do own one other pair that does not have this problem). I'm outside the return period and not sure I would purchase any more of these pants given that I'm stuck with them now.  Warm, unreliable outdoor pants should get a zero star."
1.0,"Same as other reviewers have been saying, it broke right away. I had been really happy at first, felt comfortable but it seems to be made cheaply made"
1.0,"I was so excited! I opened the clasp to try to put it on seconds after the package arrived in the mail. The clasp broke off the chain, unable for me to fix it. Never got to even wear it."
1.0,Way to small. Does not even fit my 12 year old 90 pound daughter and I ordered a 2X
1.0,Me and my daughter’s bracelet broke the very same day so I’m bummed with this purchase.
1.0,To hard to understand for age appropriate kids
1.0,Literally broke within 2 days of using it. Threw it in the garbage. Should have expected as much when the shipping labels said China.  :(
1.0,"The silver part seemed to be burnt, it was copper colored instead of silver. No yellow in the smiley either.<br /><br />I wasn’t expecting something amazing since it is already a cheap item, but I was not expecting such a inaccurate item"
1.0,"The idea of the bodysuit is great, but the product is a terrible one. It peeled out off immediately. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Not enough compression, the hold is minimum!"
1.0,"Started falling apart in 2 days, very disappointed of the material.. dont recommend it"
1.0,Not even the same dress that’s listed.....it’s a cheap knock off made of polyester. It doesn’t even have pockets. It’s looks like an old lady moo moo.
1.0,Broke after a hour of wearing
1.0,"These pants look so cute in picture and when I received them they were different, no drawstring at all and they ran really big. No pleased at all."
1.0,They don't work. 10 degrees above and my feet were frozen
1.0,"Could not get the plastic ends firmly fixed to the eyeglasses temples.  I assume that since there were no instructions, I was using them correctly.  If there is someone who knows something I don't about these, please let me know."
1.0,Horrible! Ordered a 2x was maybe  a L at best cheap stretchy material. Looks like it came from wish
1.0,Fell apart after a few weeks
1.0,This thing fits worse than a plastic bag. Not worth the money. The fabric is plasticity and not at all how it looks in the picture.
1.0,Love this item but the sizing is incorrect. It is to small!!!
1.0,Never wore it!! Ordered a 2XL (normally wear a Medium). I am 5&#34;10/160lbs arms were WAY too short and the torso barely covered my belly button!!
1.0,Way too small but the description suggested ordering the next size up
1.0,I bought the single pack in the same size and it has been great for over a year. They two pack ripped the first time I put them both on.  Total waste of $$
1.0,It was too big!!
1.0,"I don't know, something is off about these that they mess with more than just the color in my vision and have given me a headache. The yellow color is good and the case for it is nice, but I won't be using them anymore. I tried a handful of times and I get a headache every time, better to go without the driving glasses."
1.0,when I opened the package I noticed the beads are too far apart and not at all like the photo shown.  one bead rests in between my breast as shown but the other one lands on top of my stomach.  the entire chain is waaay too long and I couldn't even figure out how it goes on. I'm not pleased with this purchase at all.
1.0,The first hook broke right away.
1.0,They said the color is red and is more like a brick Light orange brick color not pure red What is under the picture is totally untrue
1.0,Cheap fabric. Not true to size. Will be returning
1.0,"I bought it for my niece. It tore the first time she tried it on. She wears single digit size jeans, so it was suppose to for without any problems."
1.0,"Pants were a size too small, pants are poor quality, returned it right after I tried it on"
1.0,"My husband is 6'4"" and weighs 300 lbs.  He wears a 3X.  This 3X would not even fit a Male large.  Wanted them for a cruise but too late to return them. What a disappointment."
1.0,"PÉSIMA CALIDAD, PUBLICIDAD ENGAÑOSA"
1.0,"Very small... Not what I was expecting at all, not worth the money."
1.0,The fabric that was supposed to cover the breast just dangled and it dangled.
1.0,They are pretty but very thin on the ends so when putting it on it scratches you and cuts skin
1.0,"It didn't look that great after trying it on.<br />Also, the fit is weird, it is tight at the shoulders and under the arms."
1.0,"The fabric looks cheap and the the inside feels very scratchy. I don't know how it fit, I refused to let my son try it on.o"
1.0,Someone wore it and send it back<br />Had deodorant stains by arm put and a pack of gum in the phone holder
1.0,Looks dull already
1.0,Way over sized and shapeless. Didn’t really find it to be flattering. Returned it.
1.0,Xl is almost like a medium
1.0,This item was but what I expected. Unfortunately not a good fit.
1.0,This product is way to small. I ordered a size up because that’s what the reviews said and it has no chance of fitting it also tore as I was trying to put it on. WASTE OF MONEY!!!
1.0,Could not get it to fit my versa
1.0,Cheap products. Washed it and it unraveled in the washing machine
1.0,See through... lighter color than picture
1.0,"I wanted to return this item because the fabric is too thin and you can see through it but they want me to pay for the shipping back, so I thought I'd keep the item to wear around the house instead and let others know how cheap the material is. For the cost, the material is still too cheap for what it is worth. Waste of money. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
1.0,"Poor quality, small sizing and labels/packaging have a ton of misspelled words which makes it impossible to give as a shower gift. The quality does not match the price at all."
1.0,"It’s a thin, shapeless tank dress with far thicker straps than shown in the item pics."
1.0,Not what is displayed. Cheaply made. I need a refund
1.0,I purchased a lucky cat and got a dolphin.  Two entirely different critters.
1.0,Really bad quality sorry I bought it
1.0,The top is fine but the shorts are not flattering at all. Look like a diaper in the front
1.0,"Cheesy,cheap,disclored and plastic feeling."
1.0,Dislike the material is cheap I'm sending it back.
1.0,"Pretty disappointing. Well... okay A LOT disappointing. So asked for medium because the picture showed it on the model as large. Thinking the size would be too big in large, I ordered medium. Now said shirts I was so looking forward to lounging in are the size for a midget. I'm thinking okay maybe weight loss goal to make the size for a hobbit, fit for me. anyway.. very disappointed. The size must be extra extra extra extra extra large? Or maybe the 9 year old who made this shirt for me was new on the job? Or maybe it should be posted you need to get a size that's two sizes or three sizes over the size your getting because the hobbits who work in the factory are getting the sizes mixed up for everyone else."
1.0,The picture in the keychain was blurry. It looks like maybe the two colors were not aligned well.
1.0,"Sizing is not correct! My son is 4.5 yrs old, bought large size but way too loose. Have to wait 2 more years to wear. Smell really stink after washed made all his clothes smell bad like skunks. I bought this brand on Ebay a few times (shipped from Korea) never stink this bad."
1.0,No lo use para nada ka calidad de la tela muy mala para nada k ver con la foto
1.0,is very long
1.0,These glasses are not what they were advertised to be. There tint is very dark and they're extremely cheep looking.
1.0,I ordered these and was so excited to get them.  They are a beautiful color but I think what I was sent was a kids size.  I ordered xl and usually those fit perfect (for me not too tight)  these however are small on my 10 year old niece who is not big at all.  Would not recommend.
1.0,"BEWARE--- Huk does not stand behind their clothing.  I have purchased 7 items from Huk  and been relatively happy until on of my quarter zip shirts had a malfunctioning  zipper.  I contacted them and asked them to replace it and they told me to take it to a seamstress and included a link for my to send it at my expense to be repaired.<br /><br />This is TERRIBLE customer service.  Companies like Arc'Teryx, Mountain Hardware, Marmot etc would have simply replaced it and kept a satisfied customer.<br /><br />Lots of other good companies to buy from -- I would not buy or recommend buying form HUK again"
1.0,looks... cheap. arrived broken from the seller.
1.0,"Before they were eleven washed, the pants had several hoses in the croch."
1.0,Not at all how it looks in picture. Returned.
1.0,"China needs to remember that ladies in the USA thier bodies are totally bigger in size than they are. Top fit  the bottom, were to little. I bought a Large. The bottoms look like a small! Disappointed"
1.0,I ordered a 4-6 small and received a medium bottoms and small top.!
1.0,The outfit was made of a rough scratchy fabric.  Very cheap material and it was expensive.  Very very<br />disappointed.
1.0,"The thread would pull from everything, I did not know it was like that! The picture is so different!!! Wish I never purchased it! I honestly wish I could have sent it back, but I missed my return date!!!! 😣"
1.0,Might not be true brand. Usually wear an xl for matty m but this was comically small. Super disappointed.
1.0,the mask is WAY too big and looks nothing like the pic. it is distorted and not at all looking like the lips pictured. DON'T BUY.
1.0,Fabric different than pictured!
1.0,Ordered these for my boyfriends inspire 3. He tried to put them on with no success then I tried for about 40 minutes without success. The pins would not align properly and would pop out almost immediately. I'm very disappointed with this product and plan to return them.
1.0,Ripped first time wearing them
1.0,I immediately put this back in the package and sent it back to Amazon.  The fit is awful and it looks cheap.
1.0,"the fabric is too sheer, I had to return it"
1.0,THESE ARE NOT 2X SIZES MORE IKE MEDIUM
1.0,Costume is cute but my daughter couldn’t wear it for Halloween as the fan broke. It was running but couldn’t blow the costume up.
1.0,"Gave it to a 10 year old, barely fit it was so small. Never buy from them again!"
1.0,"the magnet is so weak it not hold the earring , waste of time or money do not buy that"
1.0,"Way too big! Ordered a small, and if fits like an XL. Not very flattering at all!"
1.0,The dress is very cheap looking and see through. I don't recommend.
1.0,Brand is Playboy (like the adult magazine) Poor quality and sizes seem to run for Asian frames.  Don't bother
1.0,These boots fell apart after 2 weeks! Horrible quality!!!!
1.0,Sent back for refund.
1.0,"It rolled at the top and bottom and was very quickly, very uncomfortable. I didn’t wear it longer than to try it on."
1.0,"Does not fit any Panerai clasp, either tang or deployment.  Also looks like it was used"
1.0,Paper thin. Don’t waste your time or money. Could be used as a bathing suit cover up. Very disappointed.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:99dc1540bf7634be345892f9757d1ff9]] I brought this to wear to a wedding in the tropics. I danced a bit and yea it was hot. But that’s the only time I wore it.<br /> I also wore $5 jewelry in the ocean and waterfalls and guess what? They still look the same. Waste of money
1.0,Definitely not durable- zipper broke on 2nd use. Very disappointed
1.0,failed after about 3 uses - hole developed at seam .  much too expensive for so little life
1.0,I ordered these in an extra large and I wear a large. They are too small. They fit like a small. Definitely will not order these again.
1.0,absolutely disappointed with the quality but i guess you get what you pay for
1.0,I'm not happy with this.  it runs very small.  Order 2 sizes up
1.0,Crap!  Not as listed or pictured!  Runs small and you get whatever color they send you.  And you are charged shipping to send back!
1.0,Do not waste your time. You have been warned.
1.0,"Omg. These are so funny! First, I wear a large pant. I got the xl knowing pants from Asia usually run small.  These are for someone who wears a small or medium pant. The waist is Tiny! Also, there is no lining so there is nothing “sweatpant” about these. They’re also see through (I got black) so they surely aren’t going to be warm at all. Complete waste of money and an inaccurate description."
1.0,"These were described as organic cotton. When I recieved them, they were in a plastic envelope that just said made in China. No organic certification anywhere."
1.0,Terrible. Fell apart. Wires popped out.
1.0,Missing stones
1.0,"Look carefully at the picture.  The nosepiece is backwards.  They are very small and jabbed into the bridge of the nose, couldn't keep them on the face."
1.0,Wrong design.
1.0,Did not fit my Berticci DX3 watch...needed 5/8&#34; width.
1.0,I had such high hopes for these super cute boots but the heels broke off the first night I wore them.
1.0,My box was empty. Got the package but the box it came in was empty.
1.0,"The most weird sized pant I ordered in the wide leg. Price fabulous but these are very difficult to even get over legs and mine are like very thin. Once I got on waist about 2 inches smaller as measured against my other size 30 waist jeans, and while tight in thighs as noted above below knee awkward wide look & fairly wide, almost too much material. Hope this helps"
1.0,"Es una porquería de producto, lo que dice ser cuero, parece ser un plástico que se degrada. sencillamente se deshizo en mis manos. No lo compre es realmente malo."
1.0,"This hoodie has the ""F""  word on it. That is language that I don't allow.  Unfortunately this grandmother isn't in the know on things. It looked cute. The word didn't show up clearly. I sent it back. Wish Amazon had taken notice of the foul language."
1.0,Wrong belt shipped.
1.0,This arrived later than expected and could not be used. The sizing is inaccurate in my opinion.
1.0,Tight double knit material<br />After reading all the reviews this dress is not what I expected<br />I will be returning it
1.0,"did not like the quality, the accents look like cheap plastic. I returned andgot my money back with no problems"
1.0,"Nice style, but does not fit at all, cannot button. I wear 48 or 50 garments, XL & XXL, this vest is more like a 44"
1.0,Wayyyy too small. Threw them in trash.
1.0,Shorts are too long for me. They hit me in the middle of my knees.
1.0,the product smelled like gasoline.. enough said
1.0,baby bracelet
1.0,"I just don't understand the good ratings on these slippers. Maybe because they weren't put on and taken off about a dozen times per day like I did. While they are comfortable, warm, cute, and soft and are great for lounging, they have a very serious drawback. After only 5 weeks of use (one week out of warranty) these shoes are due for the trash. One of the straps has fallen off due to the cheap stitching and two more are starting to come loose. Only one stitch remains strong. If the manufacturer would fix the stitching on the straps these would be nice. I looked at some other items that used stitching and noticed that all of them use a cross-hatched stitching pattern which seems to be strong. The pattern on these is just a simple rectangle. Not very strong. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Is very small
1.0,Avoid this item. The quality is terrible and IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE.
1.0,"Did not like them. They require assembly apparently. They are difficult to keep on, because they are very heavy. Much bigger than they seem."
1.0,"I found the neck line to be too wide, it is poorly cut so therefore it flops downs in the front and when you pull it up it slides<br />off your shoulder. The rest of the cover-up runs somewhat small. I was disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,"When I received the item, it was damaged when I opened it, so disappointing"
1.0,"Very bad quality, return label did not print stuck with the item, don't waste your money not worth it."
1.0,this is a good looking hat but would only fit a child.
1.0,The gem fell off after wearing it less than two times. Buy elsewhere.
1.0,Don't buy this shirt<br />It's a prohud !!!
1.0,cheap fabric and it looks nothing like on the pictures
1.0,Unwearable. I'm pretty sure the original post said &#34;true to size&#34;.
1.0,"I am a 40H, so finding a good bra is a never ending struggle. At first I loved this. It's perfect, except by the end of the first full day of wear the underwire had poked through the fabric and was digging into me."
1.0,These are not the real AF1.  It’s a rip off.  Do not buy them!
1.0,Broke after 3 days
1.0,"This was a disaster. It was way too big. Oh has no shape to it, it just hangs. No flattering on me."
1.0,They are really cute and comfortable but after wearing them one time they stretched out to another size! And I can not return them.
1.0,"So cute. Granddaughters love them.  However, the sparkles are falling off without even being touched. They just walk and the sparkles fall off. Would return them but the girls love them."
1.0,The earrings are cheaply made.  Clasps don't close well. It cost me half the price just to ship this junk back.
1.0,"Disappointed. Many knots, raw and poorly finished knots. Plus there’s a gaping hole on bottom with raw wooden shards poking out. Good size and shape, but I’m going to have to do substantial work to sand and refinish to a usable piece."
1.0,Ordered rose gold ring and received silver ring.
1.0,"Don’t waste money, shrinks after 1st wash and turns into a t shirt!"
1.0,Glove is NOT gold. More of a copper color and is very small and stiff. Very disappointing. Seller would also not honor Amazon return policy and allow me to return the item.
1.0,I took maybe 3 showers before it started rubbing off onto my skin leaving a blue-ish/purple tarnish.
1.0,Product fit well but looked cheap. Pattern was weird
1.0,Junk!!! Soap washed the tint off one of the lenses.
1.0,"This happens often but isn't an excuse, came squashed so it's like permantly disfigured. And looks awful"
1.0,I only received the shorts! Very disappointed
1.0,"Horrible quality, didn’t last one week before stains showed up"
1.0,"I am only 5'1"" and the sides of this dress are way too short. Might be okay with leggings but it's not okay alone."
1.0,I bought it in black and navy. The navy one you can basically see through it! Sending it back...
1.0,Didn't even last 2 weeks and one of the ears fell off.
1.0,We finally used these earings on my daughters ears and they literally ate through her ear
1.0,"Heavy, clingy, silky cheap fabric, more like lingerie.<br />Hot & not at all becoming.  Stitching is puckered in the high waistline like sewn using wrong tension setting."
1.0,Total junk save your money
1.0,Doesn't fit well or stay closed.  Popped open and Apple Watch fell to the ground and busted.  :-(
1.0,Colors no good
1.0,Ordered Iron Grey and received the Brightest Highlighter Yellow colored shirt I have ever seen!! No Beuno!!!
1.0,nothing like the picture.
1.0,I was flying high choosing a birthstone earring as a special Christmas gift. I even added expedited shipping to make sure it was there before Santa's sleigh rumbled into town.<br /><br />I checked the tracking number every day for 15 days after I looked like a schmuck when everybody's presents were out for view except mine on Christmas morning.<br /><br />But wait. More deception. Dazzling Rock finally emails me that they could not find a pair of gems I ordered in the same  size.<br /><br />Not content with that Amazon sends me this message.<br /><br />  Item: 18K Rose Gold 10 MM Each Cushion Peridot & Round Diamond Ladies Infinity Dangling Earrings<br />  Quantity: 1<br />  ASIN: B07D11623K<br />  Reason for refund: Item pricing error<br /><br />Tell me what you would  believe.<br /><br />Wrong Price. or Wrong Size.<br /><br />Disappointing business Dazzling Rock.<br /><br />69 Billiion for Bezo's error . Pricing error for mine.<br /><br />Messing with folks feelings should'nt rate a star.<br />Does a Lump of Coal Rate?
1.0,Dress looked nothing like the picture.  Not true to size.  Ordered a XXL.  Anybody a size 12 could&#34;t fit the dress.  It had 2 big holes in the lace.  Sorry I lost my $33.00.  Might as well put it in the trash.  Whoever sold this dress should be a shame.
1.0,A huge no. Fit poorly. Was not cut like the picture. Awful.
1.0,"These run very small, had to return because they look like children’s shorts."
1.0,This ring was a piece of thin tin metal.  Did not like it at all and sizing was way off.  Very disappointed!!!
1.0,Brim doesn't bend up or down and it will not reshape making it look funny.
1.0,1. TOOOOOOOO Small<br />2. Not cotton<br />3. Shipping was over 3 months<br />4. Ugly ASF!!
1.0,"Ugly, huge, bright!"
1.0,really poor quality
1.0,"It is a really cute little handbag, and a really good price.  The only problem is that it has a very strong, bad odor.  I liked it and it was not expensive, so I thought I would try fabric refresher, that didn't work.  Neither did wiping it down with antibacterial wipes, or a wet washcloth.  I hope that it eventually off gasses enough to actually use it, but for now I don't want to even think about putting my stuff in it.  I wish I had just sent it back."
1.0,I bought these for Tough Mudder.  Once they're wet they have zero grip.  Before they're wet they have amazing grip.  Maybe a good utility glove but they're terrible for the Tough Mudder.
1.0,We don’t care for these masks. The inside lining is thin and not in any way bonded to the front therefore it goes up your nose and into your mouth when you inhale. They are cute but not functional for us.
1.0,They really suck if you have big legs. No instructions..
1.0,Ordered and received fast but product is not like one shown it’s a cheap material like hard material not stretchy thin like the picture shirt is short no long like picture don’t waste your money unless you want a biker shirt set with a waist length shirt not at all like picture not even design mines looks like just a color not tie dye waste of $25 bucks unacceptable to me
1.0,"Daughter won’t wear, says it’s itchy on the inside."
1.0,"Great fit, nice looking, and warm. Plastic came off pocket zipper, not too big a deal. But then fly zipper came apart on third wearing - only thread was stopping the zipper from detaching and it had broke, no metal like most fly zipper. Ok, sewed it up. Couple wears later, crouch stitching blows out as well. Not sure I'll be able to sew that up but I'm past return now."
1.0,These sunglasses were broken upon delivery! I open the box to find broken glasses...Not a happy customer right now :(
1.0,Nice wristlet. Kate Spade is awesome. I phone guys are horrible. Do not order from them. Find a different vendor.
1.0,"The earrings arrived bent, but still wearable. However, one snapped right off the peg that goes into the ear. Waste of money."
1.0,My daughter didnt like it and was returned
1.0,"Very cheaply made and made my travels more difficult.  I used this for my carryon backpack.  This is flimsy and very lightweight plastic.  It felt like it would break in half at any moment.  Also, when strapped to my backpack, it would not easily fit into the overhead compartment.  I had to unstrap each and every time.  When you are in a hurry to get things put away so others can get by, it just becomes an inconvenient option."
1.0,I think this item is defective because it shrunk in the length considerably. I should have returned it but I never got around to doing it.
1.0,"Very  rough material, it is not soft not stretchy at all."
1.0,I found this item to be of incredibly poor quality. After 1 hour of wearing it 6 beads had disappeared.
1.0,Turn color fast
1.0,Arrived looking gorgeous but after just 1 week of wear the entire shoe is peeling... all over...will need to return.
1.0,They look like girls jeans I sent them back.
1.0,It was a nice material. But lots of loose threading. Could’ve been great but too many short comings.
1.0,Won't stay in. They always fall out and make me look like a total poser.
1.0,Loved this coat- at first. Did not realize the sleeves are fitted sweater-type sleeves. This makes it difficult to wear anything with a bulkier sleeve underneath. The second time worn the entire right sleeve split apart. Return process was easy. Really wish the sleeves had matched the coat AND that they didn’t tear apart!
1.0,"I saw this on an Instagram influencer. It is terrible quality, very sheer, short in the body and boxlike. It looks like something from the dollar store."
1.0,"This is not the dress I got, i got something completely different, a cute dress but not something I would ever buy and not what I paid for, buyer beware"
1.0,These broke one day after I recieved them
1.0,ALL of my jewels to the studs fell out within a 4 month time span. would not recommend. claires has better nose studs that start at about $14.99 and you get about 9 studs.
1.0,These were tight to cutting off circulation on my skinny 12 year old daughter.
1.0,"First of all, the stones looking nothing like this, they are round and dull and cloudy. Second, it's the HARDEST thing on this planet to put in. One side would not spin, like it took me almost thirty minutes and some pliers to finally get it off. I get it in my ear and they are just as difficult to spin back on. I'm willing to accept this, but I look and the bar is CROOKED in your ear. It it literally sits almost like a seesaw. The icing on the cake, as I'm taking a picture for this review one of the stones fell out. I got a replacement item so I could have something in my ear until I can make it to the mall to buy a better one. This isn't worth $10, it's barely worth $5."
1.0,"They are cute, but I guess too small for me. I gave them to my 6 years old"
1.0,"I love the outfit, so cute! But at our first diaper change while wearing the outfit the snaps came right off. Now the top is not useable."
1.0,"I bought this knowing is was going to look cheap after reading the reviews, but I didn't expect it to look beat up! The plasticky pleather has terrible wrinkles and creases all over it (like it was stored crumpled up and smashed) and some of the quilted stitching is already falling off. And I'm disappointed in the color too. I ordered purple expecting the pretty lavender color in the picture. It's a very red-toned purple instead. Kind of ugly. I bought this purse for my 2-year-old just as a plaything, but I may just put it straight in the trash."
1.0,"The crown arrived broken. The metal piece that attaches to the crown and has the combs was broken off. There were also several stones missing, not in the package. Very disappointing. I needed it for an event, but it is too broken to be able to use it."
1.0,"My first thought was, ""this needs an instructional diagram to put on!"" After looking at the pics again, I'm sure I can get it on correctly... however, the ""panties"" that came with it are more like a medium than an XL... hoping the rest fits!"
1.0,not even an hour into wearing these they gave me blisters and the sole started stabbing me
1.0,Dress doesn't look like the picture. It was short sleeve and lace all the way down. It was pretty but not like the picture.
1.0,Not what I expected.  Not a shinny as pictured.  Only 1 day to return. I will not order from this company again!!😣😣😣
1.0,I’m 5’9” and these came right to the top of my ankles. After being washed they came about an 2 inches above.
1.0,"Crappy, the paint comes off to quick and it's not easy to work with.."
1.0,Sent back.  didnt like the pattern
1.0,The zipper broke the first time I used it. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,"Very cute, great for any occasion.  It just fit to small and I went up two sizes."
1.0,I got this bracelet yesterday and this morning broke. I absolutely love it it’s very charming but poor quality. I am only giving one star because it’s beautiful.
1.0,Cheesy not impressed
1.0,Masks are very bulky and thick even after washing. The sizing is off too. I may return.
1.0,The &#34;lobster claw&#34; clasp was too tight and the chain is small so it broke on the first attempt to remove the necklace.  I would go with the heavier version.
1.0,"I ordered this back in August, the other reviews seemed legit. Payment went through, it left the facility in China... and that was it. So I guess it got lost because it never registered as being anywhere after that. I was super excited to wear this to a concert in October, guess that's not happening. I am still trying to be hopeful that I will receive it, but I do not think it likely."
1.0,"Just received this shirt yesterday, washed it and wore it to school today. I have a very strict dress code at school as I am a medical student. Hence why I bought this shirt. Anyways, the sleeve stitching started unraveling today and would not stop. By the time it's done, it's not going to be stitched together anymore. I LOVED this shirt. Nice color of purple and really comfortable, but now I feel as if I wasted my money on it! Can the seller please contact me to resolve this problem?"
1.0,Too large and heavy
1.0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! When I got it there were long strings that were sticking out. Okay, whatever, I let it slide because it’s a beautiful piece for my Apple Watch. Then I got to wear it and the joker pops!!! All the beads on one string scattered everywhere!!! I’m very disappointed in this"
1.0,Sizing is off it’s china sizes way small
1.0,I received the wrong top.<br />I ordered the tie up top and received a ruched side top instead. So not cute
1.0,Have the blue vest love it. Bought the yellow sooooo disappointed the first day the badge holder seam released over the next few days the pocket seams released on one vest. The other vest did the same thing the pockets are not holding up. I only carried my work badge and pens.
1.0,Horrible! Do not buy
1.0,"Ordered a 2XL, which is my typical size. However, the zippers did not even come within 6 inches of eachother, which means the actually size was perhaps a medium, at best. Also extremely thin and low quality material. Not worth the money."
1.0,Sizing isn't accurate. Way too small and doesn't stretch much.
1.0,it falls from my wrist it doesn't work its not good
1.0,"I purchased for my husband. Returned because when I took them out the package one sleeve was rip at the seam. They fit nicely, especially since my husband has large biceps."
1.0,"This is nothing but isopropyl alcool. All it will do is clean the lenses well. I recommend rubbing a cloth with baby shampoo on the inside of the lenses before each use, it beats every commercial application I have ever tried. As for this, even spit beats it."
1.0,I bought these slipper because I'm a Raiders fan & loved them once I seen them on Amazon.  I wore the slippers a total of 2 times & the sole has come unsewn from one of the slippers!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1.0,Everything was too small.
1.0,these socks looked like they had been through the was 50 times after only two washes. Don't Buy!!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!<br />Pattern is on one side only.<br />Run big-time when washed. Will dye other items if washed with the bandanas.<br />Whatever is used to create the pattern, flakes off into small specks and gets all over everything when washed. (Kinda like glitter flakes but worse.)<br />I threw away after washing.<br />Damage done!"
1.0,Don't fit your ears right and hurts your ears
1.0,Got a black visor instead of a red hat...
1.0,This case was cute but it did not fit correctly!  The back piece does not close evenly
1.0,Hat has the wrong letter.
1.0,In less than a month it's already broken.
1.0,"Cannot breathe at all, and feels like you’re being smothered with the foggiest of the plastic"
1.0,"I wear a 2xl so I bought a 3xl to make sure it would fit but the hoodie was still insanely small, as if it was a child’s 3xl, gonna have to return it but if it’s for a child then I guess it wouldn’t be too bad"
1.0,"Runs Extremely small, i ordered 3 2xl for a gift and they don’t even look like they will fit me and i wear a medium."
1.0,"Way too small! I got an XL when I normally wear a M and it was like a crop top, clung to me like cling wrap and was an itchy material. Hate it. Do not purchase unless you have a toy poodle that could wear it."
1.0,It broke as soon as I unpacked it.
1.0,Yuck! The material of the dress is gross! Trashed it
1.0,Didn't do anything that any other piece of material would do.
1.0,"If you have any semblance of a chest, don’t buy this. It fits awfully. It ties together at the breast and leaves a gaping keyhole that you would never be able to wear a bra with. Super unflattering."
1.0,"Got the XL, would fit a 12 year old I suppose, don't buy if you are an adult......"
1.0,"Disappointed in them, had them stored until I was able to wear them because I was losing weight, on the second use the buckle ripped clean off when I was tightening it.<br /><br />Even without the ripping after 1 use the paint had started chipping, I don't recommend. Waste of money.<br /><br />Buy something more expensive, you'll get something that lasts"
1.0,"Beautiful watch, but didn't work."
1.0,Just wasn’t the frame I expected. Now even close to what the description read. Very disappointed
1.0,While putting on the belt the clasp broke off and pieces fell off and rolled away. I have never had that happen before even on belts I have had months or years.
1.0,The material was way thicker than expected and the size was larger than expected.
1.0,What I received was not the same as the picture shown above. So I was really disappointed and dissatisfied because I was looking forward to wearing them.
1.0,"I used the side for Cherry MX style housings since that's the type of housing my switches had.  No idea how the side of Kalih-style housing functions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this switch opener really isn't great.  It helps loosen the top housing, but does not cause the housing to pop all the way open like a metal opener would.  I ended up using angled tweezers to open the switches I had instead since I could do it faster that way.  The plastic material of the opener just wasn't strong enough to really get the switches open.<br /><br />I would hope that a switch opener would make the work easier, but it turns out it just complicated the process.  For that reason, I'm returning mine."
1.0,Nothing like pictured in the ad.
1.0,It was the wrong color and it was not high waist  a spot where themateril was not sewed and it's a hole I tossed them. order was not right want a refund
1.0,These fit a 7 year old. Supposed to be 2x
1.0,There are decorative gold squares on the end of the earpieces<br />They are horrible and tear my hair out!!<br />See picture.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter just before winter and she got a little dirt on it so I washed it as soon as I took it out of the washer the silver stuff at the top of the jacket was already warn off just from one wash...its a warm jacket but im kinda disappointed that it now don't look new after being washed 1x
1.0,Onesie runs way too big
1.0,Felt like a night gown. Cheap. Thin material I didn’t even try this piece on as it looked cheap and not even worth the 20$
1.0,"Please do not buy. Fake, Fake, Fake!!! Not a pandora charm. The one star is because i could not post my review without a star. For me it is definitely zero stars"
1.0,Way way way too small. Nothing more to say. Tried to give it to my daughter too small for her 17 year old frame too. It's going to be returned.
1.0,I bought 2 sizes up and it was still 2 sizes small
1.0,This product does not provide the seal needed to properly filter 90% or greater. Don’t water your money.
1.0,"See through and felt like abrasive acrylic.<br /><br />Also, the thinness would have been a deal breaker anyway, but these are constructed out of a knit fabric that is very, very loose. Meaning, that by the looks of these, they'd either fall apart after two washes, or they would ABSOLUTELY snag on any and everything. Returned."
1.0,"To call this a workout tank is farfetched. The fabric is cheap and you can see the outlining of the bra cups straight through the fabric. If you were to sweat in this top, you'd see it in every spot. The only way I would buy this top and wear it is if it were black, but even then it would only be to lounge at home or run an errand."
1.0,Don't waste your money does not work does not stick on follow the instructions step by step does not stay on have to return them don't waste your money
1.0,"Liked the fit and style. Order was received promptly, but what garbage material. Like others, they ripped because of cheap thin material - not manufacturing. Steer clear - much better options out there."
1.0,This coat is made for a really short woman.
1.0,it broke the same day I received it
1.0,Bought same size in 4 other colors. Fit fine. These won't even go over my hips. And I sized UP FROM PREVIOUS PURCHASED CAPRIS. SAME DARN PANTS.
1.0,Disliked ask for a refund got my money back
1.0,"This is a man made stone called opalite, not moonstone at all. I love the style, but it’s not as advertised."
1.0,Item is not sterling silver!!! Turned my wrist green!!!! I was so embarrassed!! Would not buy again
1.0,"Large size is still too small.  The magnet end keeps pulling through the solid end making installation more difficult than needs be,<br /><br />Wrist band edge damaged in two areas.  These form little hooks that get tangled up on clothing, pockets<br /><br />bayite made a good one for Charge 2 but don't make one for charge 4"
1.0,"The crown is held together with valcro. When we received the crown was missing one of the strips. Also, the band to hold it to the baby's head is about 2 ft long. It made no sense."
1.0,The thickness isn’t the same. The size is smaller and less durable.
1.0,Such a cute design but there is NO elastic in the legs and they are huge!  I’m very disappointed. We are on vacation and will have to either use it as is or find another one. Even with her little swimmers diaper in it’s absolutely huge through the legs. The rest of the swim suit fits fine.
1.0,thought these were sketchers but they are a look alike. For the price sketchers is a better shoe and value.
1.0,These masks are flimsy & thin. I was not happy & quickly returned them.
1.0,Broke when I pulled it out of the box.
1.0,"** This cap fell apart after about a month of use. The fact that it's lightweight is a liability when it comes to wearing this repeadly out on the trail.  If you want something for durable use, look elsewhere.<br /><br />This is a multi function cap with many uses.  At its basic level, you can remove the snap-on rear and front neck covering and use it as a very lightweight, foldable cap to keep the sun out of your eyes and your head protected and cool.<br /><br />With the rear snap on covering, you can keep bugs and the sun off your neck and tuck it into the back of your shirt for extra warmth or leave it free for ventilation.<br /><br />The front covering will protect the top part of your chest, the part that always gives me trouble when I'm wearing a polo shirt unbuttoned.  This will keep you well covered, particularly at high elevations.<br /><br />I'd recommend this hat to hikers, backpackers or anyone who likes to frequent the outdoors in the sun."
1.0,"The “v” was upside down. It was stamped so that even if I turned it over so show the other side, it was still upside down. Can’t wear it and not worth shipping and materials to send back."
1.0,Looked great but the first time I wore it it came open and I lost all my charms. Was told by an origami owl dealer that it was probably a return that they resold.
1.0,Tiny. Like a child's watch. I feel huge!
1.0,"Item is a very thin fabric, very poorly made. I took a chance on an item with no reviews, but never again. I would not recommend this to anyone. Thankfully Amazon has great customer service and returned the item for a refund."
1.0,"Way too big!  No return that makes sense,"
1.0,1. Not genuine leather<br />2. Come in a Ziplock bag<br />3. See second photo 🤣
1.0,"I like the idea of this product.  I remember it from days past  This product depends upon adjustments for length etc. , but the locking mechanism does not hold up under counterpressure.  The materials are easily bendable ""tin"" like mechanisms, that easily bend in an off position when you want the length lock on.  I am not a clumsy person  easily challenged by such matters.  Be advised."
1.0,It shrunk 2 sizes when I dried it. She got one wear out of the shirts and now she can't wear them anymore.
1.0,Not as expected.  Looks cheap and just not worth the money.  Then it comes from overseas and refunds aren’t available per email from seller :(
1.0,didn't like at all just a small piece of silk
1.0,started peeling right away after normal use and today it broke!
1.0,The ring that opens to secure the tag broke off when depressed. Cheaply made!
1.0,These ARE NOT hypoallergenic. I had massive reaction to them. I have been using cortisone and benedryl for the past 48 hours. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Purchased an 11. My daughter wears a 7 and they fit her. These run wayyyyy too small.
1.0,Size indicated is not true to the size!
1.0,"Well, I regret buying this."
1.0,"I have been polishing my jewelry forever and this is the<br />Worst cloth I have ever used, it did not take of any tarnish."
1.0,El gorro para adulto muy pequeño
1.0,"It is very cheaply made, smells horrible and you can’t see through the eyes."
1.0,I ordered this jacket three times by the time I gave up. It runs small! And my zipper broke on the second and third jacket.
1.0,"These are NOT 4mm balls, more like 2mm maybe 3mm. The ring is an okay size, but not as long as expected. Very disappointed"
1.0,"If it doesn’t fit or you are unhappy with it, you are to return to China for a refund. The shipping cost was over $70. Never again"
1.0,"After one wash, the image was ruined and began peeling off."
1.0,"This dress arrived quickly and was cheap.  Should have known.  It looks like it was made by a person sewing for the first time.  The quality is horrible, it was waaaayyyy bigger than the 2t we ordered.  The sleeves gaped terribly, strings were all over the dress, the appliques are falling off and our daughter hasn't even worn it yet.  It has black fuzz sewn into the dress.  It is also nowhere near the advertised color of pink.  It's peach and ugly.  This dress is piss poor quality and I am putting that thing back where it came from, or so help me!  We have scrambled to order another dress.  I'm shocked someone would sell that and think it was worth it.  You should be ashamed and embarrassed"
1.0,horrid fit. the bra cups have a life of their own
1.0,Horribly made! Cheap material and ackwardly fitting. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,The item is crappy Quality . If it was made of a more pliable material it would. be more attractive. Junk - dont buy
1.0,Lasted about a month. Cheap threading- luckily my sister has a sewing machine.
1.0,They fit funny and have a really low crotch. Hate them.
1.0,"THIS SWIMMING SUIT FELL APART WITHIN ONE WEAR!! The underwire popped out and the seam ripped. I washed it per the instructions and wore it one time to the pool. The swimming suit runs small, even with the US comparable sizes listed. Do not buy if you have any sort of chest. I wear a 6/8. I ordered the L(10) and the top is still small.<br /><br />**UPDATE: Company sent size up. The bottoms are bigger but the top is the exact same cup size with just a larger band. Do not purchase if you have anything over a B/C cup!"
1.0,Mask is too thin. Made of 100% not cotton. Nose sucks in mask when breathing. Would not recommend.
1.0,"The picture makes is look much nicer than it actually is. The person who said it looks more like a father and child was dead on. The chain is not like described as well. It's a cheap dime store chain not a snake chain as pictured. The velvet bag has NO writing on it, just plain cheap velvet. The necklace comes wound up around a piece of cardboard like it was hanging on a Walmart rack before it was shipped to me. The back of the pendant is hollowed out. The contours between the &#34;mother&#34; and child look rough as if they got stuck in the mold and were ripped out instead of smooth like the picture. The only good thing it has going for it really is that it is actually quite heavy for it's size so I kinda believe there may actually be some real silver in there. I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my niece who is a young single mother. Its 6pm on Christmas Eve so I guess she's getting this piece of junk along with an apology of a cheap looking gift. Hopefully I have a nice jewelry box around here somewhere to put it in to try and make it look a bit nicer. If your looking for a &#34;meh&#34; cheap gift for someone, look no further. Otherwise, keep scrolling.<br /><br />P.s. I'll try and upload an actual picture of the item I received soon."
1.0,The size medium was smaller than the size small! Makes no sense...
1.0,"I really dislike these socks. They're too small to fit over the top of my foot without squeezing my toes, the rubber on the heel doesn't actually keep them on my feet, they're extremely thin, they're uncomfortable, they make my feet sweat, they just do not work for me. I got Saucony instead."
1.0,Got this to go with my daughters Power Ranger Halloween costume. It broke within one day. Totally not worth the money unless you plan to put it on a shelf and look at it.
1.0,Waistband sperated from cloth
1.0,Definitely does not fit true to size. My mom normally wears a large to extra large. I ordered a XXL so she can wear her sweater underneath. She couldn't zip with a t-shirt on! Extremely disappointed.
1.0,"Product fits like a large. Im typically a 1-2X depending on the brand, i purchased a 3x because i wanted it to be comfy for sleeping and it fit snug like a large. It was poor quality, lots of loose stands of the material, and the buttons were loose"
1.0,Even for a compression shirt the size is very small. I could not get the shirt over his head let alone get it all the way on him
1.0,Flimsy and cheap
1.0,The post off of one of the earrings broke off after only worn 1 time. Love the look though.
1.0,They did not last long and broke the first time I used them
1.0,"The bag was really flimsy BUT, I only paid $10.99 so I guess I got what I paid for. The zippers on the outside pockets keep getting stuck."
1.0,very cheaply made and impossible to size to your wrist size.  I have returned it for a refund
1.0,Runs small and is super thin
1.0,The part that goes around ur stomach is too small<br />It should go frm high waist to lower stomach not in the middle how it does
1.0,HORRIBLE!! Looks very pretty but can only wear it once before it turns on you. If this were sterling silver this would be so pretty . It looks so nice on but sadly it's cheap. Also falls off be careful not to loose it the cross comes out of the hoop.
1.0,"NO ES ORIGINAL DE GUESS, NO DEBIERAN PERMITIR VENDER ESTE TIPO DE PRODUCTOS POR AQUÍ. DEBERÍAN DEVOLVER MI DINERO."
1.0,Super cute but only wore them a few times and the stitching all come undone around the legs.
1.0,What I received looks nothing like the picture. What I received looks like a large T shirt with shoulders cut out-no cute ruffle sleeves. Very disappointed. Looks even more awful when wearing it. Will probably donate it to goodwill since it costs too much to return it.
1.0,I had ordered this dress in pink and when I got it the floral design was not same and the dress wasn’t as pink as shown in pic. Very disappointed :(
1.0,Jewel doesn't stay put and the piece is super tiny. Mine easily broke. Don't bother.
1.0,Don't listen to the American size chart...I don't no what these people are thinking but everything's about 3 sizes way to small!
1.0,Not what I was expecting and it's a huge waste of money. .
1.0,Terrible fit. Looks like it's a child size not adult. Waste of money.
1.0,This dress is not it. It’s not constructed for a woman’s body. Very weird fitting dress
1.0,"Super cute, super soft, but the stitching at the waist came off after about a week. Now I have a huge whole. Won't repurchase!"
1.0,I just received this coverup and it smells like fish. it is cute but it stinks im afraid to wash it because I don't want it to mess up but I cant wear this on vacation. I waited 3 weeks for this im so disappointed.
1.0,Not pretty like shown
1.0,It looked nothing like the picture and the fabric was not the same.
1.0,"I ordered this on the size I usually wear, but could hardly get it on my foot. It was terribly uncomfortable, so much so that I returned it and will not try a larger size. This is a nice enough looking slipper, but not for anyone with a foot wider than a C... A side D foot might be stretching it."
1.0,The skirt is small and looks very poor... like an old piece of cloth
1.0,"The body is too short, i am 5ft."
1.0,"Material was very cheap, not the type of blazer material I was looking to buy."
1.0,"This blouse is a beautiful color.  But I would not have paid $17.99 for it.  I wouldn't have paid more than $5.  Don't waste your money.  I never got the chance to return this item, but I would have if I did. It isn't as long as the picture shows it and it fits really awkward.  Im 5'11 and 165 lbs.  Also the fabric seems cheap and put together, cheaply made."
1.0,Hole in glove
1.0,"I bought this and I’m a size 4. I’m 5’3 and it barely covered my 😳. Also I am a 34C and my boobs were COMPLETELY out, like.... to the point even a tank top would still be inappropriate. The material is cheap and I was concerned I ordered a dress for a child.... but no. It’s just stupid small"
1.0,It started ripping up the sem after a couple of wears.
1.0,This band was not comfortable to me. The leather is not soft and the stitching made it weirdly itchy
1.0,"I purchased two of these dresses.  One for my 11 year old grand daughter and one for my 7 year old grand daughter.  Both dresses were not constructed to hang on them as you would desire.  They were flimsy, thin and looked pitiful on them.  They will be returned immediately.  However, we found two other dresses that were quite nice for the money.  A black long sleeve dress by Balasha Girls (maxi dress) and GORLYA girls long sleeve patchwork floral print (black top with turquoise/black bottom, maxi as well).  Then a Jxstar long sleeve girls dress regular length 130 angel blue.  Grand daughter is seven and liked it so well she didn't want to take it off.  Has great twirling potential as described in description.  I would not recommend the storeofbaby dress, but I would recommend the others mentioned."
1.0,"Mala calidad, se ponen negros a la segunda puesta"
1.0,The fastener was broken on both bands (original band and replacement brand). looks great but obviously very cheaply made - would not recommend.
1.0,It sheds fibers
1.0,The seams in the toes were irritating
1.0,This skirt was not at all pictured here. I am pissed I can not return it. I tried it on and it was short and too small. Just a whole mess
1.0,I purchased a 3x just to be safe but it fits like a small to medium. The material made me think it was going to rip when I tried to put it on. I think it's in the Chinese size chart. I guess I shouldn't have expected to much based on the price. However I will be sending it back.
1.0,"Looks super cheap, the felt sorta sucks it fell apart"
1.0,"Clasp to attach to watch does not hold, I had to super glue it on!"
1.0,"I purchased this for my granddaughter, for her birthday. I tried it on my finger and it doesn’t change colors at all. Nothing but a piece of junk!"
1.0,Not what I expected at all. Don't like the material or fit.
1.0,"Cute design, but it slips (I’d rate a zero if I could)!! Slipped off during my weightlifting workout, during yoga, even just sitting & eating lunch! I tried turning it different ways as shown in the advertising photos, nothing worked. I do not recommend at all, & I’ll be looking elsewhere for a replacement headband."
1.0,Look for something else
1.0,"I got a black one in size medium, and a white one in a small as gifts. The black one came early as a Christmas present. The butterfly was obviously ironed on by hand (which is fine, IF it were done well), the shoulders were way more broad making it look more like an XL, way more cropped than I thought it would be (more like a tube top)<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad one from the batch, but I'm not waiting for the white one to come. Cancelling and returning both orders<br /><br />Maybe worth ten bucks, but this was not worth my twenty dollars"
1.0,Suffocating.<br /><br />Fogs up
1.0,Lens popped out in the first week- cheaply made
1.0,The FRONT RIGHT pocket is sewn to the leg and it is on purpose as far as I can tell.  You can fit about a can of chew in it and and that is about all. The color on the picture looks like it worn faded but the pants I got look like brand fabric - not what I was looking for.
1.0,The first one would not retract. So I did a return and replace. The second one I received was broken. I did not bother trying a 3rd
1.0,I liked absolutely nothing about this sweater.  It is on a donation pile.
1.0,Will be sending it back.
1.0,The support only lasted after one day of wearing.
1.0,Not a fan of this dress at all.  It's just a frumpy/poofie dress.  Not flattering at all.  Does not look at all like the picture.
1.0,"Description stated that the sizes had been updated to reflect US sizing. I usually order a large from another company that keeps raising their prices. I ordered a medium for a little extra compression. The medium is something a 10 year old boy would wear. Holding it up to myself, the bottom of the shirt was 3 inches above my waistline. I'm 5'11, 175lbs."
1.0,Very bad quality.  My kid wore it once.  It fell apart.  Spend the money don't buy cheep!
1.0,"The sloth decal was very cheap looking, like it might come off in the washer. Fit was too small and the neck was stretched out like someone else had worn it. I was extremely disappointed and will be returning it"
1.0,The watch is real nice. But the digital time does not light. Guess I will return it.
1.0,This is junk.  Not worth the few dollars.  There is no way it can be used with a costume.
1.0,Cheap made and very small. Worthless to use as key ring
1.0,It sheds terribly.
1.0,These were listed under the category for Womens socks.  They are NOT for women.  These are baby socks.  The marketing for this item was misleading.
1.0,"El botón no está completamente seguro y hay que ponerle pegamento para que se mantenga estable.<br /><br />Tiene muchas fallas de costura.<br /><br />Se redujo<br /><br />Eln general, el pantalón termino siendo donado"
1.0,Poorly made and the print and color is horrible. Not even worth sending back. Money wasted
1.0,I returned this item. The outer straps were too large and looked horrible.
1.0,"These are sooo tight, with arthritic fingers it’s impossible to put on without hurting"
1.0,All of the comments sum it up. This hat is crap and nothing like the description
1.0,"Product broke then second I put on the straps, definitely avoid at all cost"
1.0,So sad. They came apart before I could even get them laundered. Don't buy.
1.0,"Not really natural feeling, the legs are cut slightly small in proportion to the waist. Having a larger waist I also have thicker legs. The waist fits fine but the legs are tight.<br />The fabric feels a little rough, I hope a washing and fabric softener will fix that."
1.0,"wallet had everything I wanted in a wallet. unfortunately it was delivered with tear. Upon reflection, this wallet would not stand up to being a quality MOM wallet."
1.0,Tab pulled and batteries dead! Also bent! Appeared like you “re gifted” a return wand. I received on sale and you wouldn’t let me exchange. VERY disappointed since my granddaughter needed for Halloween.  NOT happy with you at all
1.0,"Loved the way the watched looked was so excited to get it, and it comes and it is completely dead. I was very disappointed. Now I'm going to have to to a jewler or something to get it replaced. I was really looking forward to wearing this watch. Now I am wearing the other one i purchased that came with a full battery, but that was just supposed to be a back up. Beautiful watch, but very disappointed in this. Will never buy from them again."
1.0,Too slippery. This product will make you break your glass dishes.  Don’t buy!!!
1.0,The bar that secures the band in the clasp is too short and constantly pops off while I'm wearing it. Useless.
1.0,"Costume jewelry cannot help with Diabetes.<br />Relying on this may have GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.<br /><br />Life seldom gives you a ""heads-up"" about danger.<br /><br />You were warned."
1.0,"Product of poor quality, extremely bad and poorly finished. made in China. I am so disappointed that I do not dare to return and ask for the money back."
1.0,It's very cheaply made and took forever to get here almost gave up hope
1.0,These are not work pants they remind me of sweat pants/ work out leggings. There terrible
1.0,These Sucks! They didn't even Stick! Very cheap! I Recommend Buying The $30 Brand From Etsy.
1.0,So tiny I can barely tell what color the rhinestone is. Fine for a third piercing or a childs ear. I won't use them.
1.0,Bottom ones do not fit my motherfuckin teeth
1.0,"My wife purchased this for our family photos last weekend. Unfortunately she had to return it because the looks was not very desirable and rather boxy. On a positive note the return process was free, smooth and easy. Thanks!!"
1.0,The display is hard to see. Even with the lighted back ground it's hard to see the time. The left side knob to set the left side watch face fell off within 3 days.
1.0,Order a few sizes up.
1.0,Did not help at all for nightine bike riding.
1.0,Bought a large and I wasn't even to get my arm in it and I normally wear a medium. When I went to mail it back I wound out it was going to overseas and would have cost me $74.00 to return it. VERY VERY UNHAPPY...I WONT BE BUYING FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
1.0,The material is really cheap. Is not worth it
1.0,China garbage
1.0,"I normally like Frogg Togg items - their rain gear is the only rain gear I use.  However, this item did not work for me.  First, this would not stay on my head while wearing a ball cap.  The elastic was too tight and the cap would pull right off my head, which isn't good if you're trying to keep up with your hat while out canoeing on a river.  Second, this material isn't pliable like my FT rain gear - this is stiff.  It softens when wet, which is the purpose.  Once it dries, it's as stiff as cardboard!  Might be okay if you don't mind a wet shirt but my main goal is to keep the sun off my neck.  Finally, this doesn't breathe as the material is simply too thick to allow airflow."
1.0,They say 2XL but are actually only supposed to fit a size 8
1.0,Very poor quality will be returning the item..
1.0,It broke when she tried to but it on
1.0,"I purchased cause i liked the black and white checks and zipper. It ended up being Cheap, horrible quality. This skirt was very stretchy with plenty of room. The issue from the beginning was that the zipper was off track so as soon as I put it on, it split and fell off me! I tried to fix the zipper, to no avail. Save yourself the embarrassment of exposing yourself in public and don’t buy this skirt!"
1.0,"Purchased these a few weeks ago. I put them in the carrying cloth they come with and put the glasses in my side pocket of my shorts. Walked into the mall to pick up an order and as I left, I pulled them out of the case and see these scratches on the lenses. The arms scratched both lenses. Unfortunately they do not sell lenses separately."
1.0,This should be sold in the children’s department
1.0,I return this product does not fit like the picture at all
1.0,I was so very very very disappointed. The dress had beautiful fabric and did look like the picture but I couldn’t keep it because it didn’t fit correctly. I wouldn’t say Plus size at all.
1.0,Cheep and flimsy !!! Go to the dollar store
1.0,Horse head fell off immediately. Great packaging but pretty lame product. So I guess I paid $26 for nice packaging.
1.0,I Bought it put it on!! And as soon as I started doing my every day chores. The ink started running & you couldn’t see the Mickey no more. So I had to Return it definitely was disappointing.
1.0,"Broke the first time I wore them. Great idea, bad craftsmanship."
1.0,"Se rompen al ponerlos, se abren las costuras y tienen olor a pintura"
1.0,"The blue on the leggings don't match the blue on the bra! They were supposed to be a dark gray with a dark blue and dark purple. Well they're light gray with teal and a fuschia color. At least the purple bra matches the leggings. Also, while the top fit okay, the leggings run really small and thin. I might rip them with one workout. They have a weird chemically smell out of the package too."
1.0,Way small took a month to get gave them to my son. Will not order again
1.0,These are just fun - play things.
1.0,I wouldn't recommend. It doesn't fit well.
1.0,These socks are certainly not 100% cotton. They make my feet hot the same way that nylon or polyester socks do. There is no label on the package to indicate the composition but they look like they have some small percentage of cotton and the rest is synthetic materials. Is this a scam or an error on the seller's side? I cannot tell for sure. But it is false advertising; an Amazon ought to take action against such items or sellers.
1.0,I ordered a large but got an exlarge! There is no way that’s going to fit me. So now I have to sent it back.
1.0,Worst quality ever!! First rain and broke in pieces
1.0,"Has hard plastic on inside near arch, very uncomfortable"
1.0,I’m a size 18 and the size guide says to get 2X but I wanted them a little looser so I went up a size to 3X. First it’s FLEECE lined which is a no no in FL hot weather. Second there is NO STRETCH...I could barely get it past my calf without a struggle. It couldn’t even fit my daughter size 12 bc it’s so small.
1.0,Did not work for the advertised watch
1.0,"Package was worth more than the band. Not rose gold faded on arrival. Only one thing I like about it, easy to assemble. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Runs small, returned"
1.0,Broke the 1st time I put it on and the beads went everywhere 😡😡
1.0,This outfit is awful<br />The material is cheap and the general make of the outfit is confusing.
1.0,"This cost the seller about $0.60 to make.  And that’s what it felt like.  After trying to put them on, I almost tripped and fell.  These should not be sold at any price over $1.00"
1.0,The ball came off the ring the second day and is nowhere to be found. Never had this issue with a belly ring before. Cannot be worn now.
1.0,The t-shirt could be made of a thicker weave for the price of almost $20.00 Instead of looking so threadbare.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Cheap.
1.0,Didnt stick in cool weather here no way it would have in Australia where I bought these to wear. Returned them
1.0,These are humongous!  Two people could have fit in one pair.  I think I could have liked the style and comfort if an XS was sold.
1.0,"Dont buy for the LEDs they stoped working after afew days, other than that my son did like the shoes. The liner inside come loose after a month exposing the battery which is not good!"
1.0,Too big.  I didn't pay attention to the dimensions
1.0,Nothing like the picture. False advertising. Straight leg yet described as skinny Jean ! Wasted 30.00 .
1.0,Broke as soon as I tried to start it. Just so so so cheaply made.
1.0,"I returned these as soon as I opened them...they are definitely NOT SILK.  Maybe someone else actually received a silk pair, but I, unfortunately, did not.  What I received looked like it was a spandex/polyester blend, very stretchy and shiny and cheap feeling.  Silk does NOT stretch like that.  I bought this as a gift, and repackaged it to be returned as soon as I opened it."
1.0,"I love the color, opened the package and cleaned the tunnels. Put them in and it felt like it was a 00. I ordered 1/2”. Going to return"
1.0,It didn't look at all the pic!
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for.  Cheaply made.  Threads coming out of the seams.  Ordered two sizes up and it still is way too small.
1.0,The materials used are subpar to anything I’ve ever seen. Super cheap materials. It looks super ugly in the light.
1.0,This dress was terrible. Fabric did not at all look as advertised and it was not a cottony material but that awful slippy shower curtain material. Fit was super tight for such a large size and the chest was splitting open between the buttons. Major Fail.
1.0,It’s broken
1.0,I bought these as dust protection while sanding and while I like the feel of the stretchy breathable fabric if it stretches it offers less protection. This is billed as big and tall and it still had to stretch quite a bit for my head
1.0,Terrible - fell apart and did not pair up colors--pd extra delivery fee to get for weekend and couldn't use. Very disappointed.As u can see I have placed many orders except this and an infinity bracelet that turned my wrist green
1.0,Sending it back. No support and doesn't lay right.
1.0,"I wear 36D bra size mostly, sometimes 38"" when the hooks are in 1 or 2 rows and no room for expanding it. This bra measures 30 inches in the bottom of the bust, so it is extremely small. I ordered 38D to be on the safe side, but the cup is also small. I would need to order a 46"" DD to compensate the measurements and the difference of 8"" inches. The size chart and instructions in the posting are not accurate either.  Nice quality. May exchange it."
1.0,Buy this at least two sizes smaller than you are. They made me itch really bad! I'm moderately hairy so if you're a furry man avoid this product.
1.0,These ratings were extremely small. Not what I was expecting!
1.0,It is very thin and does nothing to keep your drink cold
1.0,"Very small, picture not as advertised."
1.0,Not pleased with the amount of time to get a refund from them!
1.0,Ew! Don’t waist your money. Seriously feels like wearing a plastic tarp 🤢 very disappointed.
1.0,"Too big, need a smaller size."
1.0,If you want sparkle DO NOT BUY THIS MASK! Not even remotely like the picture. Total SCAM
1.0,"The overall fit, waist placement, and hem length  made me look like total goober!  Had to go back. Note: the red belt in the picture is my own, and I'm wearing a distracting pair of red earbuds (sorry).<br />The dress comes with a skinny black belt."
1.0,"Description says 8.5W. I received a size 6M. Very frustrated with my purchase. It is showing it takes 14 days after receiving my item to refund my account. So now, I'm stuck without shoes that I needed for work, and can't purchase new ones for at least 2 weeks."
1.0,The fabric isn’t what I was expecting and they are for short torso or for hipsters. I
1.0,Melted in the sun. Piece of junk.
1.0,One earring broke after one use.
1.0,Le entra el agua
1.0,"Does NOR hang at all. Sticks straight up. May fit a child/toddler. Cheap material too. Unfortunately,  I purchased 2 colors. Both are the same. Awful.  Very disappointed."
1.0,To say &#34;runs small&#34; is an understatement.  I went up a size and could barely get it over my shoulders.  Too bad...it's a really cute pattern.
1.0,Product was not worth the money I spent on it
1.0,"Just used for a day and it is already sagging and highly uncomfortable, my feet starting hurting in a day , and I only wore it inside house. I would never buy it again. So disappointed."
1.0,Very dissatisfied.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased. The bracelet started to over stretch and fray one week after wear.
1.0,"I don't have large ears or anything - perfectly normally sized - but there was NO WAY this cuff would fit my ear like the picture.  Is that the ear of an 8-year-old, maybe?  The cuff came maybe halfway up the height of my ear."
1.0,"The bottoms of these are too big.  Top is cute, but bottoms are very loose.  I purchased this suit for two different people, both had the same problem."
1.0,The maker states that these earrings are nickel free and hypoallergenic.  Not so.  I wore these earrings for a luncheon and after one hour my ears were swollen and itchy.  Do not buy these earrings if you have sensitive ears.
1.0,"Very cheap. Only had it for two months and I don't wear it often, but the boots already have a hole and the inside of the boots are falling out."
1.0,"I would love to tell you how this bra feels, unfortunately I ordered over three months ago, and I still have received it, there is no way to track it."
1.0,Bought  a Meduim based on everyone's description....My 4 year old is wearing it for a swimsuit cover....WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,"It’s just the cheap crap they have in Halloween stores, no function just junk you use once and throw in a closet as clutter"
1.0,I can't stand this item. I sweat a few drops while wearing this and it just started peeling off and not sticking to me.
1.0,I wear a xxl I bought a xxxl fits like a small it’s super tight not even worth returning at this point because of the covid 19 pandemic do not buy it’s not true to size at all
1.0,Disliked the fit. Too short to be a dress and I'm only 5'1. Also the sleeves are so itchy that even if I could have worn it... I wouldn't have because of how itchy the fabric for the sleeves was.
1.0,Frame broke in the first 2 weeks. Piece of junk!!!
1.0,Very cheap and flimsy. Also very big and does not stay on.
1.0,The white bands are missing! I don’t appreciate this!
1.0,Did not meet my expectations. Was much smaller than it appeared on the website. This was purchased for an adult who is an avid Hello Kitty fan and it looked like something for a small child when I received it.
1.0,My under boob was barely cover by this top. It feels terrible like a book cover and the collar fabric is not stretchy at all. Returning immediately.
1.0,"I ordered this item to wear for Easter and it took a long time to arrive.  When it finally arrived, it was missing the booties that were supposed to be included with the outfit.  If I mail it back and reorder another costume, I may not get it by Easter."
1.0,Very cheap<br />Advertised as clip on was not
1.0,Exhalation valve is too stiff and does not open.  Exhaust air ends up blowing into my glasses.  Perforation on mask looks awfully thin and so there is no protection along there.  I use these for when I mow the lawn.
1.0,Unflattering and poor quality. Not true to size. Returned!
1.0,Band broke after 2nd wear and watch fell and broke
1.0,"Broke after the first use! Opened it up and used it during a light rain, went into a store and when I got ready to leave and go back into the rain it was broken. Nothing happened to it while I was inside the store, like it literally just sat in my buggy untouched till I was ready to leave. I went to go open it up to get to my car and it wouldn’t open. I had it for a while before I used it and I figured it wasn’t even worth it to send it back, so I just tossed it. I kept getting emails to review it, so there ya go!!"
1.0,"I purchased Identical pare of these glasses many, many years ago. The only problem with those glasses is that they got dirty between the sliding plastic lenses. And, over the years the adjusters on each end of the  glasses started to bind and not move the lenses smoothly. I purchased these new glasses in hopes that they<br /> would work as well as the old glasses did when new. However, I find that the they are binding out of the box. The box was crushed and probably the reason that they are binding.  I will return these and see if the replacements are any better."
1.0,The color was dull and not as vibrant as the pictures. They looked very old like there were sitting in storage for years. Some of the pairs were extremely bulky and heavy.
1.0,Size down when going by the size chart
1.0,"It wasn't good at all.fabric was not as expected,didn't fit at all"
1.0,Was not what I expected. Very thin and looks way out dated. Very disappointed
1.0,Bought the product due to the overwhelming positive reviews. My glasses arrived with the lens warped so watch out for that
1.0,Cheap appearance.
1.0,Very disappointed. I was SO excited for this dress! I typically wear a L/XL in dresses. I ordered and XL and it feels at least 2 sizes too small. The fabric is cheap and see through. It feels like spandex. I am definitely returning it. I wish it were displayed obviously that it's from China.
1.0,I'm giving this 1 star because I bought the same boot in the same size but I bought multiple to see the difference between the different Browns and they all cost me a different price. BUUTTT it turns out that there's no difference in the color so I can not justify getting charged more! Plus they ran a half size small.
1.0,"tarnished easily, not even worth the low price."
1.0,I wanted to write a good review I swear I did but my 4th day into my workout and the left arm on the jacket split and I squat and it spilt up the back and I purchased two of these in case something like this happened but now I’m scared to workout in the other one please don’t waste y’all money invest in something much better a waste of money and time I’m so pissed right now I want my money back 😤😤😤😤
1.0,"Why have a picture when you are sending clothing items that are different? The stripes are not on the top! I needed this item for my 4 year old’s spirit week at school. The material is cheap polyester and thin (will probably ruin if something snagged it). The logos are iron on and not embroidered. The stitching around the neckline is not finished and looked rushed is not straight. This is not worth $31, and I am highly disappointed with this item."
1.0,"toooooo smalll... wow, but very pretty"
1.0,Looks are very deceiving
1.0,"I purchased this Jacket for a Christmas gift for my 28 year old Daughter she wears a med/large jacket I ordered a large size. I received a size Med. which appeared to be a size small, Amazon worked with me and rushed out a new one, this time I went with a XXL, to be sure. It arrived as promised however, it was the same size! only the sleeves were longer. The only positive thing about this jacket are the patches. Ruined Christmas Gift!  This  jacket should be sold as  a child only jacket based on the super super small size(s) Buyer beware."
1.0,I loved the keychain but the pink strap broke after a week of use. Very poor quality.
1.0,I bought these for my bridesmaids and I was really excited to get them because I couldn’t find this color anywhere! I received them and they were very cheap and thin and extremely uncomfortable. I returned them the same day. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This was exactly what I needed for my monthly card games but when I received it, it was defective, i.e., the one side did not function.  This is shipped from a 3rd party and when I went to return the defective shuffler, they had me ship it UPS at a cost of $14.55 to me.  So, for ordering a $20+ item, they credited me for the defective shuffler but I was out-of-pocket $14.55 for returning a DEFECTIVE item. I have been happy with everything I've ordered directly from Amazon, but will never order a 3rd party shipped item from Amazon again."
1.0,Cheap material. Looks like it was made by children.
1.0,Nothing like described. Poor quality material ! Looked  Cheap !! Sent back
1.0,Absolutely horrible. the bag ripped at the airport as I was getting on the plane. I had to buy a new bag overseas. Never again. I threw it away otherwise I would have pictures. No way to repair it because of the way the handle ripped right out of the side. Do not buy this bag unless you only plan to put your wallet and some sunscreen in it.
1.0,Not as described. Cheap material and not worth the money.
1.0,"The cheapest thing I have ever seen !!!! Could have bought it at the $ store, & it would have been nicer !<br />Would never ever dare to wear it !!!!"
1.0,Did not seem to have any anti glare coating on the them. Could not see the image on the little card.
1.0,Was ripped
1.0,"Torso length too short in front by 5 inches in the XL size.  Back longer than front as expected but barely covers. As the garment size increases ALL the panels need to increase together. Front comes to mid belly just below belt line, not to crotch.  Zonk."
1.0,"Definitely not reversible! There's visible holes in one side of the top to slide removable pads out, strap adusters aren't two-sided and the hem on the bottom sticks out on one side. The bottoms were way too big. Plus, the clasp on the back of the top is really awkward."
1.0,"I have bough this three times, with my wonderful GF buying the fourth. To no avail! They break super easily."
1.0,Loose on the shoulders... boxy as if you had shoulder pads on. Just strange. Unfortunate bc its a cute top.
1.0,"Zero stars would be more appropriate and honest. I won't waste time and ink with details but the ""linen"" didn't resemble any fabric that I could identify - more like a form of plastic."
1.0,This item it for kids everything was too small
1.0,"I bought these socks with the idea that I would never have to purchase another pair of socks again. Lo and behold, I encountered a decent-size hole on top of my big toe after a long run ten days after purchasing the socks. 10 days! I’ve found holes in socks before (which usually take months/years, not days, to appear), but I am by no means different than the average sock-wearer. The warranty policy is great in theory, except you still pay for shipping and I live 3,000 miles away from Vermont. Tough to recommend to anyone who exercises more than just a walk in the park."
1.0,This looks cute on the model but really it is sheer cheap looking fabric that doesn't hang well at all. Waste of money.
1.0,"This came used! It had stains in the coochie and armpits!!<br /> I'm so disgusted bc I only noticed it as I was putting it on!<br />This is so gross! People understand were in a pandemic right?! And y'all resold this nasty thing, seriously ??"
1.0,"I bought a size Large for my normally size small 11 year old. Not only was the shirt tight to begin with, it shrunk so much after washing (following the instructions 100%) that it is now a children's medium. So disappointed and my daughter is very sad she only got to wear it once. Waste of money!!"
1.0,"Don't waste your money. It's cheaply made,  the material is horrible & the fit is nothing like in the picture or expected"
1.0,"At this moment I am wearing a pair of these pants I purchased at a big box store in Navy color at least 2 years ago or like $12 bucks.  Same pockets, same style --- exactly.  Not 1 lint ball, not 1 tear.  The only place where there's obvious wear is at the bottom, rear heels area.  (And for that area, I always spray with some Shout before I throw them in the washer).  In the years I have had these pants I have probably washed them 100 times.  THEY ARE AWESOME.  So awesome in fact, that they are my ever go to.  I wear them outside in the yard.  I wear them for quick trips to the shopping.  They still look great and hold their shape!  I thought, ""They're getting old and you wear them so much you better purchase another pair now.""<br />Now to this new purchase.  First, it is next to impossible to find them online and in the stores.  I know because I have been trying.  Second, I paid twice the amount of money for this new pair (which is NOT ALL THE reason I am giving this product a 1 star.  In fact, if they were of the same quality as my first pair I'd gladly - as demonstrated - paid twice as much with zero complaint and a 5 star rating).  BUT THESE PANTS ARE CHEAPLY MADE!!!!<br />The material is so cheap and poorly made... so awful.  I've washed them twice and they already have those unsightly lint balls!  I don't get it.  They look exactly the same but for the color (because NAVY was sold out everywhere).  My level of disappointment in Eddie Bauer is beyond description.  It is at a level that the brand name means poor quality to me such that I will never buy anything bearing it's name.  When you have such a respected brand name, smart manufacturers guard their quality at a nervous, OCD level.  Not Eddie Bauer.  If you've been looking for a second pair of these pants, just be grateful you have 1 already and go to another brand."
1.0,"Didn't fit, returning"
1.0,"I thought this was a female watch and I could not adjust it to make it fit my wrist, disappointed."
1.0,"I REALLY wish I had read the reviews because I would have NEVER bought this!  What everyone is saying is spot on, this shirt is WAY too small!  Such a disappointment!  I am not a big person by any means.  However, I like for shirts to be big on me, nothing snug.  So while I normally would wear a Medium, I ordered a large just in case.  This shirt, even though its a Large is truly a small!  I would NOT recommend this item just based on that.  Even reading the size chart, which I did before ordering, it says a Large should be equivalent to a 12/14---unless it is a child 12/14!  However, the title says Women's....soooo---false advertising to the fullest.  As you can see from the picture--this is even smaller than my size Medium shirt I currently have on!  NOT a happy buyer.<br /><br />*** My opinions are my own and we're not influenced by the seller in anyway. As most people, I make sure to look through reviews of an item before making a purchase online. Therefore, I do try to review each item as honestly as possible.

1.0,"Size didn’t fit my watch, it would’ve been fine if it had dir in my watch."
1.0,"I purchased a 2X because that is the size I generally wear and the shirt swallowed me.  It was very boxy and not flattering at all.  The proportions were also very wrong.  The shirt was way too long and the sleeves were too big and long as well.  This is very disappointing considering this is supposed the be a plus size shirt so it should fit plus sized bodies.  I ordered a black top and the color was incredibly faded.  I am constantly wearing black on black, to make myself look slimmer of course, and it is not possible with this shirt because the color was so faded.  The most disappointing issue is when I went to return the top Roamans is charging me over $3.00 to return it. I am a Prime Member so it's very frustrating that I am being charged to send this item back.  I will not be purchasing any clothing from Roamans anymore."
1.0,"The band slowly disintegrated after a couple weeks. In addition, the cover over the watch face warped in 40 degree weather to the point that it could not activate a finger tap.<br />You get what you pay for."
1.0,"The hat itself was nice, but the logo was bad vinyl and not like the picture at all. The circle was filled in and it just looked like some kid made it. Not worth it by any stretch of the imagination."
1.0,I ordered because the photo looked like it was a distressed gray color.  I also thought the logo was embroidered or at least better quality.<br /><br />The color is denim in reality and logo looks cheap.
1.0,Came in cute packaging but it broke right away.
1.0,The circles are too small and difficult to get the belt through.
1.0,"Turned it on and put new batteries in and tried a few times and not lighting up, fantastic. Just in time for Halloween."
1.0,They make me dizzy i cant wear these
1.0,Did not like the way the hat fit. I don't have a small head and it was way to large on top. Donated it.
1.0,"I was very excited to get this item and stunt . But when I tried it on it was ugly !!!! It did not fit me well at all , it was definitely too big . Not cute trust …."
1.0,"This item didn't look like the photo. While it would fit me, it was really short, not long like in the photo. The quality is low, really thing, stitching looks bad, just doesn't look good at all. Worst part - can't return. Didn't realize this seller doesn't allow returns."
1.0,the pink came unglued after walking in them one time
1.0,They don't fit over my glasses well at all. They stick way out in front. I look like a dork. My mom has some she got from a drug store and they fit great. I guess I didn't realize that there are different sizes. I don't believe that was stated in the description of these glasses. I think they may fit if you had small wire oval glasses.
1.0,The other 2 were perfect all 3 said large ..the black one is like XXL
1.0,These earrings are very cute in the picture and still cute in person. My problem is they kept wanting to hang down on my ears. They did not sit in my ears like they do in the picture! I was very disappointed in that!
1.0,The socks were just ok when I first received them. I put them in wash and dryer as usual since I do not like to wear anything that is not clean and washed. Big mistake. They came out extra extra small and shrunk. Waste of money unfortunately. Hopefully I can find someone that just gave birth so I can give them to a baby since that is only what is good for now.
1.0,My kid got these wet the first day he wore them because kids and they're all moldy already. All his Nikes prior never immediately molded so I am calling these crap
1.0,It is soooooo long. I would never have the time to wrap it. It’s a joke
1.0,"First off the picture is very deceiving... then lens only had about 15% with what was supposed to be ""24k gold"" but most of the lens is Blue with purple at the ends. Also when I went to fit it in the frame it clicks in but is loose. I have the Shaun White edition Offshoot's and it's not even close to the original 24k Gold iridium lens they came with. Looking through the lens was weird with all the different colors the lens has on it. I dont even think I'm going to waste the time to get my money back because of how disappointed I am with the quality and the so called color of the lens in which was described. Just garbage."
1.0,My shirt came in the mail today the side of the shirt isnt even sewn and the arms are really tight not happy at all!!!
1.0,"If I could return and get my money back, it came broken, it goes all the way back, and then it bent<br />I would give 0 stars if possible"
1.0,the print quality is bad. definitely didn't look like the photos.
1.0,"Cheap, just bad!"
1.0,"This blazer was such a disappointment! I have four other blazers from Camuto and I wear them all the time because they are made well, fit well and look good. This one however is so awful! It does not fit the same and the quality is so low. I even question whether it’s authenticity. Don’t waste your time."
1.0,Way too thin and rough. Yikes.
1.0,"Very bad copy, returned it."
1.0,"The gage is wider than the average gage used for a nose piercing. This was a huge wasted of money for me. On the plus side, the jewelry was beautiful which made me even more bummed I couldn't use it."
1.0,"This bracelet has copper backing, and turns my wrist green !"
1.0,Do not buy this fail apart and changed colors in two days.
1.0,"The product looked gorgeous on the website, however, when it arrived it looked old. The stitches were coming off at places. The glue came off the flowers. It was horribly packaged. It was supposed to be a birthday gift. I was embarrassed to present it! Overall the quality of the product is absolutely not upto the mark considering the price"
1.0,"I really disliked this product because this company sent me the wrong coat and the wrong size its way to small. And it feels like i wasted my money on it , i really needed a winter coat and this coat sucks and it also sucks that there is no way to send it back and get re funded so i can get a better coat , i would recommend not getting this coat"
1.0,These look small and cheap compared to the photo. The red is bright and garish instead of deep like the picture.
1.0,this was so small that I think it is made for girls not women. Unless you are short. For ref I am 5'6 and 130LB. I can fit most one size fit all but this was a Huge let down. Other then that it was really soft but I couldn't put them on so I am not sure if its comfy.
1.0,I FELT SCAMMED.  Tiny cheap looking pendant.  Do not buy.
1.0,"Flimsy material, not any where close to 3x."
1.0,Poorly made.  Zipper difficult to close. Did not maintain shape.  Returned product.
1.0,Bueno el relog me gustó mucho pero e notado que el relog analógico se está atrasando más de lo habitual el digital está en la hora correcta pero observo que el minutero se atrasa ya dos veces lo e modificado que puedo hacer
1.0,They were too small. If the rings were a bit bigger they'd be cuter. But the chains were fine.
1.0,Wrong colors
1.0,This does nothing.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"If you like baggy workout shorts, these are for you. I was looking for shorts that weren’t skin tight but not baggy either in a longer length. These are definitely baggy. Not flattering at all."
1.0,This is such a cute dress but when I opened there was a handwritten note pinned to a hole in dress so was obviously returned previously...better quality control needed
1.0,This dress fit nicely but was COMPLETELY see through
1.0,"If you want a flattering bathing suit do NOT purchase this. Also if you have a butt, your but cheeks will hang out. There is no tummy control i. These shorts whatsoever. Do not buy"
1.0,If you think you're going to get a cheaper version of the Spanx compression tanks.  Forget about it.  These things are HORRIBLE.  They don't compress anything.  Even if you buy a size smaller.  Frankly I think the the word compression in their description and product title is misleading.<br /><br />Yes they are tank tops.  Yes they are very soft and comfortable.  But in no way do they compress anything.
1.0,Purchased multiple pairs and they all fell apart at the same seam within a few wears to the office. Amazon would not honor a refund or return.
1.0,No mermaid figure at all. Just a few blotches of purple. Disappointed.
1.0,Terrible material. Doesn't look like anything pictured. And it's huge.
1.0,"You have to pay postage to return the item. You can't drop it off at an Amazon Return Center. If easy free returns are important, think twice before buying. Pants were too large."
1.0,It’s not real gold turned my neck green!!! Totally unsatisfactory !
1.0,"Bigger then expected, also only plated if i knew that i wouldn't have bought."
1.0,NOT A SWEATER! Do NOT order this if you want a sweater! I am so unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,The lens on both sides of the watch where not attached.
1.0,Runs way too small!
1.0,Mine is missing the charm 😭
1.0,"Breaks everytime I put it on, and stains my neck when I wear it."
1.0,"It shipped quickly and arrived on time. No problem there. But the cups are misshapen, even for a pushup bra. It's cute, but cut way too small. I'll never be able to wear it. I plan on returning this item."
1.0,What a bust!
1.0,Very sleek but it leaked all over my rental. Not the kind of item you can count on.
1.0,"bought these thinking they were a 1/2 taper as they were stated, but were actually a 7/16. blew ear out twice trying to size up to 9/16 because I thought they were 1/2 :/"
1.0,"The material is inferior. It does not let your body breath.  The product information was misleading,  It tool a long time to come.  No tags or information  on the shorts."
1.0,Started to fall apart a a few washes
1.0,"The appearance of this bag is great, unfortunately the zipper broke as i've read in other reviews within a week of purchasing. I'm very dissapointed."
1.0,This comes 2-3 sizes too small and is made out of some weird fabric... NOT cotton.  It's like a gross jersey style fabric.  The screen printing is awful and probably because of the fabric they tried to put it on.  They offered me a $5 refund on a $14 product.  DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!  Scam.
1.0,The zipper broke on one of the bags the first time I used it.
1.0,Very cheap broke in a few days
1.0,It was a cheap piece of jewelry.  Something I would give my grand-daughter to play with.
1.0,all parts were assembled prior to shipping and they all were received broken
1.0,Fell apart after 3 days.
1.0,Very poor material it came ripped.
1.0,The bathing suit top ripped after one wear. I’ve missed my return window but wanted others to know about the poor quality.
1.0,"Quality shoes. Unfortunately, we didn’t notice until we had already use them for two months that we had one size 6 and one size 4 1/2. Disappointed when one  was too tight and the other one was still the right size.  Be sure to check when you receive them. Never really looked at them until today so cannot blame anyone but myself at this point. ."
1.0,"it is handwash, air-dry only... also material very thin.  It accentuates every &#34;problem area&#34;  even when loose fitting.  It is permanently wrinkled.  Like, it's fine and then you put it on- instant wrinkles!  So buy this if you want a garment that's a pain in the behind to care for and makes you look rumpled."
1.0,"This review is regarding the mirror component while cycling. It's a great idea but the fatal flaw is that it doesn't work. Fundamental problem is that shifting your visual focus from the distant road ahead to the mirror just an inch away from your eye actually requires more energy, time, and distraction than if you quickly flip your head back to look. Further, in the crouched cycling position the only real view was of my shoulder. This might be a great tool for rowing but for cycling it actually seemed to make things more dangerous. I wish it worked, but sadly it didn't. On the plus side, the rest of the design was comfortable and effective, so I just ignore mirror."
1.0,The gold color is so cheap and tacky. I never wear it because it doesn’t match any of my other gold jewelry.
1.0,"Horrible ,only flat chested can wear these types bras At least tried"
1.0,The buckle doesnt fit through belt loops or the pancake loops on bravo concealment holster. It did find a home permanently installed on my singleaction holster for external quickmount
1.0,Already have a hole disappointed
1.0,The buckle broke 4 weeks from buying it. The system is not giving us an option for returning.
1.0,Super short. Was not the length advertised.
1.0,"I ordered a size up, as suggested. I have a large chest, and usually wear a large. I ordered the XL, and technically it fit. However, it's very short (I'm only 5ft tall, so that says a lot), the bottom seam is very tight compared to the body of the shirt which makes it uncomfortable, and the collar is also very tight & fits around the neck like a turtle neck. Not at all like what is pictured, and the collar was so tight, I could barely push my head through it. Also, the material is soft enough, but you can see through the sweater. This is not what I was expecting, and will be returning it."
1.0,"I received them, they were for my 2 kids to take to bed with them at bedtime &#34;cuz they're afraid of the dark&#34;, or so they say. I think they just wanted the extra lights to play with....As if they don't have enough light with the tv on and the night lights. But anyway Upon opening them I attempted to get each of the girls 1 of each color that night at bedtime. And Since there are only 4 colors I should have only need to use 8. Or that's what you would think! But unfortunately this was not the case, I turned on a total of 23 of these lights just to get 2 of each color that worked, a total of 8 lights. That's over half the bag that was a total waste, just to get them each one that actually worked. The 23 I went through all had dead batteries or the batteries has so little juice they just wouldn't stay on for more than a second or they had a short in them. Even though I only paid a little over $5 for them, they weren't worth my money or my trouble....Not to mention I had to deal with 2 very upset children that throw a fits for days cuz they didn't work.The girls are only 3 & 4 so they didn't understand why they ordered something & it didn't work!"
1.0,"The design is really cute but it didn’t last, broke after 5 mins of wear, LITERALLY! Even stuff from dollar tree last longer than this."
1.0,broken 👎🏻
1.0,The chain is flimsy and a completely different color than the pendant. I wore once and the chain is already turning. I ended up ordering from elsewhere and threw this in a draw.
1.0,Half of the ones I ordered have a little sharp piece of metal stinking out of the bendy nose form. The cut I received didn’t cause any pain because the piece of metal sticking up was so sharp I didn’t feel it until I pushed it on to my face. And if you are a large man they won’t fit you well.
1.0,THe se tunnels suck! Sizes were completely inaccurate! One of them was torn. I strongly recommend NOT ordering these. I also got charged for an extra pair that I never asked for!
1.0,Way too large. Not like the picture at all. No drawstring is included to ruche the sides. Very disappointed.
1.0,Extremely hard to get onto the babys foot. I rarely use it as my baby cries every time. The rubber is much too tight.<br />If your baby has a chubby foot then dont buy!
1.0,Broke in 3 days
1.0,"This is a cute bathing suit but it's several sizes too small. I ordered according to the chart, but the size is way off. I returned it & don't recommend it."
1.0,"The waist was painfully tight. If your waist is 30 to 32 inches, I would not recommend you order the medium size, unless the one I received was somehow mislabeled as a medium, of course.<br /><br />The material is very soft, and these look nice. The waist has a lot of elastic, so if the size is not correct, the waist will not be comfortable due to the pressure."
1.0,Sizes are way off and the material is cheap
1.0,"UPDATE: After about a week, I move to take them out and they snap in half. I'm returning these. BEWARE."
1.0,I ordered a extra large and I couldn't fit the shirt over my head.
1.0,Not high quality and fit is off.  I like the style with the side pockets and length was great.
1.0,I bought two of these. In just one wash the color started to bleed and messed up all my other clothes in the washing machine. Very poor quality and material.Also transparent. I washed so i can’t return.
1.0,"I bought several different styles of these shoes from various sellers.  I really wanted these shoes to work for me.  The styles are cute and the price is great but, these shoes have absolutely NO ARCH SUPPORT at all.  About 10 minutes into wearing these and my feet, legs, back and neck were killing me!  The length of the shoes were fine but they were too loose in the midfoot - this was true for every style I purchased.  Sent them all back."
1.0,Got stuck in my tragus and was extremely uncomfortable. I had to go to a tattoo shop and get it cut out.
1.0,"These strapless bras do not stick for very long. The one I tried fell off before I left the house (less than an hour). Skin was dry and clean.  I’ve had ones that withstand humidity and hot weather, just wish I could find them again."
1.0,size was nowhere near what was advertised. too wear
1.0,"They look good, but they are very low quality metal. The posts bent as I put the hasp on."
1.0,It was cute.. but the quality was not good it would probably have snapped if you tried putting it in and taking it out once. You have to bend it..I was expecting a clicky
1.0,"I've gone as far as buying this specific product twice, both patches had the same issue. After maybe a month of use, the underwear begins to fall apart, ripping in a bunch of fairly random places for no obvious reason. What causes small holes to form in boxers that are literally in use, under a pair of jeans?"
1.0,sleeves too small.
1.0,"I finally got this in the mail after waiting a month, I was excited because it is beautiful, however all of the side diamonds fell out within a few hours. Don’t waste your money on this."
1.0,"First of all, these are NOT thermal.  Second of all, they are too loose from the knees down, so poor cut/pattern.  I didn't even bother giving them a try after trying them on and realizing there is no thermal protection whatsoever."
1.0,It is nice looking but doesn't fit and they won't let me exchange or return.
1.0,"Very tiny ring and metal work design. Hard to tell even it is supposed to be the Om symbol 🕉 However relatively fast shipping, but disappointed in ring"
1.0,Very pretty on my daughter but arrived with a broken clasp
1.0,Broke after 5 wears
1.0,The strap on one side it twisted/tilted (not connected on the right angle)...rubbed a terrible blister.
1.0,"I needed to replace my old bag that had worn out over five years and took a chance on this Baigio bag. The leather seems of good quality but the zippers are very cheap. This bag is too small for a 17” laptop as advertised and the zippers irreversibly separated on BOTH main pockets within five minutes of opening the box it came in. This might be a good purchase for a 15” laptop bag, but I cannot recommend this bag to anyone."
1.0,"Not as pictured,  color is pretty muted and a little too big."
1.0,I bought an xl and it looked like a small. Order two sizes up if you have any shape at all to your body
1.0,not as pictured and does not fit
1.0,"Bad quality lenses, bad quality frame as well as cheap and scratched.<br />I don't recommend it"
1.0,The stitching is not flattering and ruins the shirt. If you do try it size up two sizes so the stitching isn't crooked. It might look better very loose.
1.0,"Junk!<br /><br />Though, first not noticeable the belt leather is extremely thin.  It has some type of material under the leather that makes the leather only appear to be thicker.  The leather started wearing off and falling apart after about 3 weeks of wear.  The buckle is also falling off.  I will not buy another CTM belt.  I have used Dockers and Thomas Bates elastic braided belts in the past and will go back to ordering those types.  Please note this is not the fault of the seller, but that of CTM."
1.0,Dial fell off first wear
1.0,I frequently wear FP items. This feels like a child size medium at the biggest. I might keep it for my 9 year old granddaughter.
1.0,I bought this for my son for a Yule present. He opened it and the watch is Plastic!!!! This is a TOY!  He wanted an all metal fob watch. This is NOT metal!!! Poor quality and misleading description. This thing will break if he uses it. Went to Think Geek to get a Real metal fob watch for the SAME price.
1.0,I wore this once and then washed it. It shrunk right away to a babydoll size. I had to get rid of it
1.0,"Waste of money.  Does not work.  Clearly, cheap means cheap."
1.0,I bought it for just the mouth animation itself. Waited a few weeks for it and paid more than I cared to. It doesn’t have the mouth setting. It has a face with a mouth and it barely moves when I talk. Big disappointment. Pretty bummed about it. This probably isn’t what you’re looking for.
1.0,Nice print.  Delivery delayed .
1.0,"This is a case of caveat emptor - buyer beware. I bought this cheap necklace with matching earrings along with several earrings because of the price and not realizing that the shipper would charge shipping for each separate one instead of packaging them in one container and paying for the weight of that. A hugh error on my part. I paid $113.00 in shipping for about twelve pairs of earrings. Read the small print folks.<br /><br />Also, you seem to pay for what you get - a couple of the earrings fell apart in my hands and had to be glued back together. Caveat Emptor!"
1.0,"Very heavy,  too heavy for my son to use"
1.0,Too short even though I ordered a large
1.0,Love the product until it broke in less than 2 months.  I am still waiting to hear back from the seller.  Its not just the clasp but the plastic underneath that just &#34;came apart.&#34;  This isnt my first shark.  I like the design.  This was probably my last shark.
1.0,Poor quality band but the price is good.  3rd band I’ve ordered.  Band only last for 4-6 months.
1.0,Los aretes son chico no son maxi como en la foto
1.0,I ordered a 1x and the shorts looked like a small and the quality of the material was poor.
1.0,"Very bad product, not original, but don't have poblems for the devolution"
1.0,"This one was right out of the package and as I was putting them on, they ripped."
1.0,Came from China.  Took 42 days to arrive.  Ordered 34DD.  Got generic large - maybe a B cup.  Back and straps made from very cheap stretchy material that provides NO support.  Straps NOT adjustable.  Do not waste your time/money!
1.0,Beautiful blouse but a Xl wouldn't fit a medium person.  Didn't reorder as wouldn't know what size would fit. Not run of the mill sizing.
1.0,I only received 1 shirt and have not had a response back to correct the issue.
1.0,If this was anywhere near XL I would give 5 stars but No. MAYBE a medium at best.  Returns are a hassle so I will probably just give it to my child.
1.0,returned. too small.
1.0,Very Dissatisfied. No Receipt or any paperwork even to return it.
1.0,Good Looking watch but the digital clock and date kept resetting or going blank!!
1.0,I read that they ran big so I ordered a 4 instead of a 6. I am 5’7” and 130lbs. The shorts were very baggy in the front section and too tight around the legs. They didn’t really fit like they seemed to on the model. Everyone is different but I wouldnt order these again.
1.0,Had the band for two months and it's now turning my wrist green and tarnishing under the band. It was so much more than other bands and definitely not worth the price.
1.0,It turned yellow in 1 week
1.0,"Ripped after one use. The price is good, though"
1.0,Looks cute in the picture but really poor quality & has no shape
1.0,"alright so, I waited 4 months for these pants... it was supposed to arrive July 8th, its august 10th! I wrote a bad review on July 10th and the seller begged me to take it down after I CANCELLED the order. I got them today which is weird because i cancelled them... then I was like okay whatever ill try them on, literally didn't even look like the picture. The waist band was twice the size, they were see-through, and the leg measurement did not match what the sizing said lol. so... I will be returning these thank you."
1.0,The top part has NO LINING... and it’s itchy as all get out 😂😂😂
1.0,"I got a compression one before from the same company and it fits very well, this one fits like two sizes smaller."
1.0,I haven't even had it for a month and it already snapped.
1.0,The fabric it’s in a good
1.0,This piece of luggage did not even make it out of the airport before one wheel was broken on it and the bottom was cracked.  It looks like a tank and that is what I was expecting.  Do not waste your money!
1.0,I would be better off buying one from Walmart at least those last longer. Couldn’t get the ball off without plyers and tarnished in 2 days.
1.0,"When I first put it on I already felt it's kinda small. All my shoes are size 11, so i was guessing the sizs should be fine. However, after I came home from wearing these socks for over 8 hrs at work, i saw a giant hole on the tip where my toe was peeking through. They're either too small for my feet (I wear size 11 shoes) or they're low quality."
1.0,"When I got these pants, and felt the material, I didn't even try them on. They're being returned."
1.0,I purchased this for my son and it turn his finger green rip off
1.0,"Absolutely disgusting. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Didn't taste anything like cola, just like artificial syrup. When I opened it, it was really slimy, almost like someone dunked it in grease, it was really gross. It was SUPER hard when I tried to bite into it, and when I finally got a bite, I felt like my teeth were gonna fall out. It took a lot of strength to get just a little bite. Definitely not worth the 13 bucks. After two bites, I literally felt like I was gonna puke and threw the rest away. I brushed my teeth really well after and I still feel like my teeth are full of cavities. It's just sugar and artificial syrup, not a single taste of cola in it. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Terrible quality. After 2,3 times in the pool the material shredded. Made very cheaply"
1.0,I returned this item. It was not what I pictured it to be.
1.0,This choker is very cheaply made. Not happy with it and was going to give as a gift. Not suitable for an adult in my opinion.
1.0,Search Unc as a different wear
1.0,"The ring fit. The stone was horrible. Please don’t waste your money. They never replaced mine like they said they would . You can’t wear it, because if you wash your hands the stone will stop working. No one wants to take their ring off every time to wash there hands."
1.0,The fit isn’t necessarily too small but it is very short. I thought it was going to be longer but it’s cut almost like a sweater length. It was awkward
1.0,NOT STERLING SILVER. I am allergic to other metals and know that sterling silver is something I can wear. I put them on and not even 30 mins later my ears were hurting me. THIS IS NOT STERLING SILVER
1.0,"I have no idea what is this. Really disappointed. I didn’t check the comments before purchasing, seems like I am not the only one received this. This product Feel like a total lie."
1.0,I purchased this poncho in a med/ lg. I don’t recommend this poncho at all! Poncho is way to short and doesn’t look at all like the picture. Totally disappointed. I’ve returned the sweater and never received my refund. Save your money!
1.0,"It was cheaply made. It broke easily when I tried to bend the piece. Adjusting it wasn't difficult, but i broke way too easily.<br />Disappointed  :("
1.0,Had a hole in it. Second better yet fifth quality goods
1.0,Not the color in picture. Laces are much brighter color.
1.0,"It worked for exactly 1 day, then stopped."
1.0,Way too small. They actually call it a adult size.
1.0,I put it on 3 times and the whole piece from the mouth down pulled off
1.0,Tho chest portio was way too open.
1.0,"Well wouldn't you know it, the entire buckle detached from the belt just days after the standard 30-day return policy. Bought this for my partner and he seemed to like it just fine until it completely broke. What a shame. Definitely won't buy this product again :("
1.0,Very poor quality they tarnish DONT BUY THESE!!! You won’t know until it’s to late to return them waste of money I can’t even sell them cuss they will tarnish in 2 months 😳🙄🤦🏽‍♀️
1.0,This product came with two broken latches. Couldn’t wear it due to it keep falling off

1.0,"I ordered these when looking for a big pair of earrings, and was extremely disappointed when I received.  I wouldn't give them as a gift."
1.0,"Too Short/too small I am 5’9”, 130lbs and the medium was way too short/tight and crept down during the day. Sizing at least one size smaller than usual."
1.0,Missed the return deadline- so<br />I donated them to Goodwill
1.0,Too big and still to small to move. If you have a butt keep looking. Waited 6 months for product. Very disappointing. They had so much promise.
1.0,"Way, way too small and very flimsy. Definitely not for the bigger busts."
1.0,Belts were much smaller than described.  Had to return. My mother who is 4 sizes smaller than me could not even where them.  I would say 30in would be a better description
1.0,"The fact that the lower half mask part is square and firm hard plastic instead of flexible fabric means that it will NOT conform to your jaw shape and be extremely uncomfortable to wear. You WILL also sweat a lot because of the fact that this is plastic and not fabric.<br /><br />Literally just go make your own Kaneki mask, don't waste money on this one."
1.0,PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND VERY DISAPPOINTED ON HOW SMALL EARRINGS ARE!!!
1.0,Mine came with a cracked stone. It is not as pictured. Mine had a lot of black matrix. This piece is far too expensive for the very low quality turquoise set in it.
1.0,"Would be super cute, but it arrived missing a stone"
1.0,Awful<br />Product horrible customer suppourt
1.0,Doesnt fit
1.0,Arrived wet and smelling like pickle juice...<br /><br />Too tight to be worn comfortably
1.0,The neckline of the dress is uneven.
1.0,Not at all like the picture. Very thin/ sheer fabric. Not white. Off white.  Returning it.
1.0,Had the watch band less than a week when it cracked.  I am returning it for a credit.
1.0,"As pictured, the sweater looks like a cotton, faded pink yarn. In person, it actually looks very shiny and acrylic-y and brighter pink."
1.0,It was broken when I revived it. I was so disappointed
1.0,Don’t waste your money. Didn’t even put it on and the band broke. Very disappointed because I paid $14 for mine.. Sending it back.
1.0,Did not have the Casio brand name on the band
1.0,"I bought the cheetah print one, it doesn’t look like the picture it’s a different type of print of cheetah  and it’s not a t-shirt material, it’s really thick, heavy and silky. Also I would size down because it was way to big"
1.0,Blue pants have no slit at all which makes the flaps look reaaaally odd and widens your hips. It says that in the item description if you scroll down but they really should put that warning on the picture itself. Very disappointed! Returning for sure and now I have no time to buy another pair before I needed them.
1.0,"Not as it describes, you will have to order a size larger"
1.0,Says small in the headline but it is way too big for a small. Returning
1.0,"One was already broken when they came in, another one broke the very first time I was taking off the ball (ball itself broke in half), one had mismatched/damaged thread so it woudn't screw into place or hold on. Would not recommend, it's cheap for a reason."
1.0,"The first pair I grabbed and put on were very comfortable, but unfortunately the other 2 pairs were for a large right foot and small left foot.  They were so comfortable that I just got a replacement, and then all 3 of those pairs were uneven.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Way to small even my 12 year old can't get them on! Sucks
1.0,No fue lo q pedi
1.0,Poor fit.  Hat is super small and I have a small head.
1.0,don't care for these
1.0,"I was highly disappointed when I finally received the rings. Every single one is a small size, made for a child's hand."
1.0,Way too small for x large 😪
1.0,"This advertises as white, but it is off white."
1.0,"Didnt stiffen my hat, but did leave nice sparkly flakes all over it."
1.0,didnt work...
1.0,I really liked this shirt but the hem fell out in the washer and it got little holes in the front after the first wear.
1.0,Sweater material is scratchy.  It had a flaw of tan in the grey area.  It was short and real wide.
1.0,Fit good - good quality.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, bad finishing."
1.0,This junior size pajama set I purchased for my super tall 7 year old is sized for a sized 10 grown woman.
1.0,Wear 2x but ordered 5x.  Way way too small.  Had to pay exorbitant shipping charge to return.  Scam.  1 star is TOOOO Many.
1.0,It was small and had NO support for bigger chested people
1.0,"Zipper broke on the first day! I'm not the only person to have this happen, read the other reviews.  In addition, these are mild weather gloves, not really cold weather gloves as advertised.  Almost got frostbite when wearing these in under 30 degree weather"
1.0,Lightning bolt is barely visible
1.0,I'm giving this a wind because of the fact that this is already the third item in a box of five that was not up to specifications for infant standards things that it was advertised as don't match up. These will not fit anything other than a two-year-old or up I have a 4 month old I wanted infant sunglasses
1.0,I washed it on delicate in cold and hung to dry and it shrank by about 2 sizes.
1.0,As you can see this dress is pictured Black. Nothing in the description says anything about it being gold. This dress is gold and black. Lot of gold too. I ordered this or an event and already purchased shows that will not go with black and gold so now I'm out of a dress for my event.  Why not sell the dress as described. I would hve lved it all black as pictured but no you send me a gold and black dress.
1.0,"Check out the pictures,  I love the color, waist, hips and front of pants fit great. The back were cut on a bias, so the back of the pants pull and crease. They feel uncomfortable and they look funny. not a business or classy look. I returned them."
1.0,The material is like a bathing suit. Its way too big. Think ill make it into a pillow or something
1.0,They came in a huge box. I thought they would be wood but they were.cardbaord. very dissappointed
1.0,El mo de lo está lindo pero el chapado es una tontería sólo dura como 4 días i se ponen negros que mal
1.0,"The clasp was so difficult to close, I had to return it as unusable."
1.0,This is not perfect years .it is too small for 4-5 years kids .it is  perfect for 22 months baby .so i am not happy about that .
1.0,I look saggy. and make me look like I'm wearing curtain :(
1.0,"Loved this, super cute but didn’t last even a week. Got a 2nd one and again didn’t last more than a week!!! Returned both!"
1.0,the zipper on the back is garbage first time to try it on the zipper broke pulled apart
1.0,Not a compression tank top just a regular tank
1.0,These are not sunglasses.  They are for use in the house when working on a computer or driving in the evening at dusk.  Don't know how you can call these sunglasses when they aren't.  Very Very disappointed and waste of $40.
1.0,"Product wasn't what was described.  Recieved a plain pair of black Spanx. Irreversible was on the package,  but was NOT in the package. I'm keeping them b/c they're Spank. But won't buy online again."
1.0,Lace looked cheap.
1.0,"I up sized as suggested, but is was still WAY TOO small.  I ordered a 3xl and it wouldn't even zip up."
1.0,Zipper Broke 10 mins after putting it on smh
1.0,It's not like the picture at all..Actually it's a completely different fabric.
1.0,"MADE FROM VERY CHEAP AND THINK MATERIAL, RIPS AND TEARS EASY!"
1.0,After 2 washing a pool day and a hot tub day this still literally bleeds color out in the shower like a kids marker.  Embarrassing quality and embarrassing Amazon quality control
1.0,Metal...yes. Sharp unleveled edges...yes. Potential to inflect cuts...yes. Inside of helmet peeling black paint. Shiny...yes. Fits most adult headsizes...only if you're average and not man sized.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d3cf57002d9ef678d0b40d720e724b36]] Waistband rolls down constantly and immediately as you let it go! I hate that.  Also the waist band is too short to hold the lower stomach (c-section) pooch in so it squeezes on top and bulges the lower belly more. There is another brand called dragon fit I bought on here that the waistband holds the entire stomach in. It is exactly as shown and fits true to size.
1.0,difficult to operate
1.0,"I wouldn't say this is cotton because it is very stiff. It is big in the arms and body area, but tight around the bottom. Wanted to return it, but I have to pay shipping overseas. Not worth the hassle."
1.0,Good size and fit except for no metal nose piece so my glasses fog up. The clear vinyl part also fogs up and my mouth can’t be seen. I can’t use these because my DHH students can’t read my lips. Bummer! I really need to find a solution that will allow lip reading and keep me safe when my students return to the classroom.
1.0,"This dress has no structural elements to keep it together. It is a wrap dress with no hooks, no snaps and no way to hold it together. It looks more like a house coat than a dress. Too much money for me to have to put more money into it."
1.0,A nice looking watch and good labelling on the hands but within a day or two the hands got stuck !
1.0,"The price of this product was very high. Because of thhe high price, i expected good quality material. Thia was made with really cheap material. Do not buy these cheaply made sweaters. It is a waste of your money"
1.0,The on off button is in the middle of the back basically unreachable by person wearing. They are also not adjustable.
1.0,Didn't fit well and was not anti fog
1.0,"I ordered a toddler size 8 and the box said toddler size 8, but it was not anywhere close to fitting! I dont know what happened.  I am sad bc these shoes were so cute!!"
1.0,"They were not able to handle webbed toes with tights. Overall, cheap and poorly made. Will not be purchasing again."
1.0,"It's unfortunate that I'm the first review on here. Unfortunately I can't leave a good review, first off the quality is very poor second off, I ordered cat in the hat per the pictures here and got Wonder woman not once but twice."
1.0,Really crappy material
1.0,"The first day I used the wallet the the clasp that attached the strap to the wallet completely snapped off. The top of the clasp broke off and is un-fixable and unusable.  The quality of the wallet is horrible, you can see clear glue lines along the zipper.  My Iphone 8 fit in the front pocket but when you have your phone in the pocket the wallet doesn't open wide enough to grab or see anything. The most I could fit was a few  cards some dollar bills and a chap stick and it got very bulgy and had no more space."
1.0,It broke a week later of use..had to purchase another one from another company
1.0,Too white for ivory color and the edge wasn't very nice
1.0,Absolutely DO NOT purchase this. The stitches were popping out everywhere and it just looks like a cheap disproportionate disaster. The same dress is on Shein for $10... definitely not worth a penny over that.
1.0,"Was sent two of the same identical horns both go on the right side of the head, very disappointed needed them for a project that would have been done this weekend."
1.0,I wore these to the gym recently and had a pretty heavy workout. These leggings showed every sweat droplet which was embarrassing. If I could return these leggings I would!
1.0,"Cheap material, much smaller than advertised. Overall poor product"
1.0,Piece of junk like the other bad reviews say. Can’t even get this stupid thing on. Not gonna lie: my wife was legit disappointed when this hunk of metal didn’t... didn’t anything. Might as well melt it down for the metal as I can’t return it because she bought it as a gift weeks ago for our anniversary (today).
1.0,"Poor product. Two sides of the ""crystal"" cube are fogged and not very pretty. Not worth the cost for minuscule costume jewelry"
1.0,Super Awful
1.0,"very cheap quality, the clasp broke, the chain broke - would not recommend."
1.0,I like it and it look good
1.0,Didn’t look like the picture the colors are more bright
1.0,Horrible quality. Stays it’s made in the USA and it shipped from China directly. Wouldn’t fit a 4 yr old let alone a 2x. A disgrace!
1.0,"I received two same ear earrings.  Because these are climbers, there should be one curved to climb the left ear and same for the right.  I got two that only curve to the right ear.  Very disappointed.  They weren’t even on the plastic earring holder; they were just put in a bag with the plastic earring holder."
1.0,"Cheap, broke right away"
1.0,Great Concept. Poor delivery . Item does not zap or Shock  but Vibrate and Lights work .....support takes for ever to respond and only in generic. Will have to return
1.0,I haven’t had this product for a long time yet. I bought it to travel with. It only came with two pieces instead of 3. One of the pieces already has a huge hole in it. Cheaply made. Not worth your $$ at all.
1.0,"This dress was very small I ordered the largest size, that was allowed."
1.0,"I purchased a size bigger and it was still way too small. The color was very disappointing, as we wanted orange/red fox 🦊 color. The clothing was clearly pink in color."
1.0,"Very cheap, very thin material"
1.0,"These are not slim fit, they are wide and boxy. Cheap material"
1.0,Does not work in touch screen decices
1.0,I ordered a small and it was too big in the waist. I returned it because it wasn't flattering.
1.0,Cheap looking and small for a tote bag. Disappointed
1.0,I am very disappointed.  I did not get the snake ear rings. I got owls instead.
1.0,"Took over an hour to figure out how to get rid of ‘pillow’, ridiculous idea. Then after all that effort my size was too skimpy snd the zipper did not work. I will think twice before I ever order clothing from Amazon again. Most important, item did not come w invoice, return label or instructions on how to figure out this ludicrous coat"
1.0,WAY too big !!! Fits ok with bulky socks- who wants to wear socks with wool slippers???<br />One slipper is very fuzzy on outside the other is smooth!
1.0,Just received the dress the fabric is horrible the flowers are pink instead of red and one of the straps isn’t even sewn on to the dress
1.0,These shoes are terrible! I put them on and when for my run...10 seconds later I realized that my foot hangs off the inside of the sole...wtf. Badly manufactured and cheap material.
1.0,janky!
1.0,Look cheap. An the earrings were missing.
1.0,The top half of this dress isn't bad.  Resembles the photo.  Went by the other reviews and bought based on the sizing chart.  What a mistake!!! I am swimming in this dress.  Literally falling off.  Now for the bad part:  the skirt is a totally different color. It is almost black and the top is like the picture.  Also the bottom half is completely see-through.  Do not bother buying this dress. Not even worth the $20.
1.0,"If you are in a cup size D or C this will NOT hold you, it comes down on the side with no strap."
1.0,I have F cups and the waist band is on my breasts! Don't buy if you are this size
1.0,"Not good at all, when you wash it for the first time, it gets a little bit stringy at the edges."
1.0,Can see straight through it
1.0,Unhappy....fabric in back thin....seam on right side ripped after 6 wears...
1.0,"It looks spiffy, but unfortunately the band broke (I bought two) on both of them."
1.0,"Cheap looking, like something a little kid would wear."
1.0,"These didn’t stay put, even after cleaning my skin with rubbing alcohol and drying it thoroughly."
1.0,They do not stick at all very poor quality and never buying this again
1.0,Literally broke as I was putting it on. The clasp spring flew across the room somewhere and the rest of it hit type ground.
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture. Fabric feels very cheap it reminded me of a costume not a dress.
1.0,Beautiful Apple Watch band. Sadly I wore it 3 days & it broke.
1.0,Sometimes you need to help people out. Don’t order this. I’m tired of staying quiet. Amazon has started to become so slack…….. I’m not done with this. I will give my life to advertise when Amazon is trying to sell something for a price that’s way too high for the quality. They know the headache for returning makes them money.
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!! The discription says Two scarves and will only receive ONE<br />.......disappointing.....It slides off of my head. I am not a ""wild"" sleeper and in the am, it is slid back midway....I have ""course"", kinky hair that i cornrow....It still slides off. Cute, but i will stick with my bonnet until I find a scarf that will stay on my head through out the night...."
1.0,Expected to buy a cute pink top but it’s 2 different colors . The puffy sleeves are a completely different color than the top !
1.0,"Runs big, it's very unflattering. Nothing like the picture. It has a square back and the front is round (neck). It's a very odd shape."
1.0,keep backing on me and lost it had to buy a fossil because they stop making that watch i went though 3 if them... not to happy
1.0,While the tie looks nice the zipper is horribly weak. Failed to maintain any kind of hold and would fall constantly just from gravity.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass.
1.0,"I really loved them online I thought they were black, nothing I could find had a color listed on it when I recieved them they are navy blue :("
1.0,"The quality is really bad and my yin yang charm fell right off. The plastic wires connected with a metal plate came right out, I had it out of the bag for about 3 minutes before this happened. But it was cheap so I'm not that worried about it."
1.0,Cheap crappy hat
1.0,"The picture used is completely misleading, because what showed up on my doorstep was atrocious!!! not symmetrical at all.  My wife thought it looked like a craft store bead.  very disappointed in this purchase.  sent it back the next day!"
1.0,"Item was dead on arrival. I tried two sets of batteries. I returned the item, well within the return window, and was given a partial refund (Less than half of my initial total charge).  I could understand this if there was nothing wrong with item, but the PKE Meter was non-functional out of the box.  Poor policy. I will not be buying from this vendor going forward."
1.0,I do not recommend it
1.0,"I have bought two of these tie boxes within the past two months.  The first one I had to return because the glass and liner were not adhering to the lid.  I really liked this tie box that I had purchased as a gift for my boyfriend, so I decided to try again.  I received the second tie box and it was in worse condition than the one I had just returned.  Once again, the glass and liner were not adhering to the lid.  The quality control on this product appears to be extremely poor.  Do not recommend that you purchase this product."
1.0,Neck looks like it’s been pulled and the material is really bad nothing like the picture
1.0,These are not waterproof. They aren’t even water resistant. Here I am walking in light rain and my feet are soaked. The main reason I bought these shoes was because it said waterproof. Unbelievable.
1.0,"Bought this item for my girlfriend. It arrived on time, but I was unable to open the bracelet. It seemed the clasp was stuck. Disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,"This ring is cheep for a reason. The stones don't shine at ALL! If you are looking for cheep go for it, if you are looking for a ring to complement your engagement ring look elsewhere."
1.0,They are cheap! Sequence sewed on poorly. Zipper broke the first time I unzipped it.  Don't purchase
1.0,Not great. Don't buy! They don't hold onto the child's leg my son is 14 months and they fit bug every time he walked/crawled they would slide down and they were more of a bother than regular pants!
1.0,These fell apart the first wash.  Terrible quality not worth the price. Horrible waste of money.
1.0,"It broke after 4 months! Seller will refund me, after I pay shipping???!"
1.0,It broke in 1 day
1.0,Don’t waste your time. It’s nothing like the picture
1.0,These are a waste of money.  They are cheaply made and don’t stay on your face so they are not useable.
1.0,Actual Size was not commensurate with the description.
1.0,It doesn't look like the picture it doesn't come with the strings which want fit my daughter
1.0,SILVER WORE OFF AFTER ABOUT A MONTH.
1.0,This picture is really flattering for a poor structured and very cheap fabric dress.  Don’t waste your money.  Extremely disappointed!!!!
1.0,Way smaller than size chart. Couldn't even wear very disappointed.
1.0,I won't be ordering acrylic again.  I have ordered 2 pairs and both are dull.  Not at all the shiny color in the photos.  This pair especially will never be work because the colors are not true and very dull.
1.0,A skirt too short to wear at my age.
1.0,My 4 year old loved it but after wearing them for 2 weeks one of the sandals ripped.  Very sad
1.0,Material very flimsy
1.0,Broken in two minutes
1.0,"Again, another sad review I’ll need to post on these color bleeding pajamas.  Not sure what type of dye is used but the minute you place them in water the color bleeds. I washed them by hand and the water turned completely black the minute I placed them in the water. They’re beautiful pajamas but I’m afraid of the type of dye that’s used in these silk pajamas that are sold through Amazon.  Buyer beware."
1.0,The zipper broke in little over a month. Couldn’t return them because the return window was passed a few days before. There is a hole where the zipper is. Terrible quality! Will not purchase again!!
1.0,This corset does not represent the measurements listed. I am typically a size 2/XS/S and this corset in a size small does not even come close to fitting properly. It is a shame because the corset would have been perfect if it would have fit.
1.0,"Top is flannel buttons, not the thermal tshirt as pictured, too small and the pants are HUGE. Not at ALL as described. 😡"
1.0,it's cheap quality.  a high end store giveaway bag is even better.  it looks like a 99 cent bag for the price of $5
1.0,The robe was a gift to my daughter.<br />I was very disappointed to hear it was cheaply made. The material is so thin you can actually see through it..
1.0,"In person is nothing like in the photo - the cut is less flattering and much shorter. The colors also don't work as suggested; I think the combination and stitching makes it look cheap. So, not what I wanted."
1.0,Cheap. Too big
1.0,very bad quality no clear vision even it might harm your eyes
1.0,Thick rubbery plastic plastic in the front of the shirt
1.0,"No tummy control whatsoever! I have to wear an oversized t-shirt to hide how unflattering these leggings are. Also, the elastic at the very top is incredibly tight. There is only one pocket so you don’t have a choice as to where you can place<br />Your phone or other items."
1.0,"I ordered this and it was WAY too large. And I've asked to return it, but they won't get back to me. If it doesn't fit you, you will have trouble returning it for a new size."
1.0,I bought the 6yrs -12 yrs.<br />Wouldn’t  go over my 8 yr old’s head and hard to put over my 2 yr old niece’s head.
1.0,Didn’t fit her was a little too small
1.0,"The first one broke within 3 days of use, the second broke as well, and the third one stayed together but it isn't silver. The recipient has a big green stripe across the back of the neck where this allegedly sterling silver necklace laid on the skin. Counterfeit, untruthfully advertised garbage.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,Product came bent. Want a full refund.
1.0,"I was skeptical at first after reading other reviews from people saying the band comes un-clipped easily. I figured ""well maybe they just didn't clean it off well enough..""<br /><br />I had the exact same problem. It does clip in and is secure.  But I noticed it randomly just comes undone. Watch fell off my wrist and got scratched."
1.0,I have ordered this product in the past from other sellers so I know how it should fit and the material. I packed them to go on a trip after receiving them and much to my surprise  when I went to put them on the top was 2 sizes to small even though the bottoms were the right size and the material was much thinner than the multiple pairs I have ordered in the past.
1.0,"Horrible fabric, don't buy... not like the picture at all. Returned"
1.0,"The material is very thin, flimsy and see-through. I purchased an xxlarge and it was too small; I normally wear a size 12-14. The lace-look at the bottom was attractive and the quality of the sewing as ok. Having thin, flimsy see-through material is rather frequent from many manufacturers in many current women's wear items.<br /><br />Also, in the picture the fabric looked like a smooth knit. Actually, it was a ribbed-knit -- more like an old-fashioned undershirt than a top.<br /><br />If you don't mind the see-through look, this product would be ok for you. Or if you ordered a really large size and are actually very small then it might drape the way you would expect it to and might look ok on you. This product might be ok for some women -- just not for me.<br /><br />The item arrived on time and was in a plastic bag for protection."
1.0,They fell apart the first time I wore them. Broke in every possible way.
1.0,"Glasses seem great, but they arrived with a scratch right in the center of the viewing area. Thumbs down."
1.0,"The suit I received did not look like the picture. It looked more like a Dalmatian print than cheetah, & the tan color was very light almost an ivory color. The bottom half is extremely skimpy & I’d say overall the suit fits about 2-3 sizes too small."
1.0,The plastic shines just like cheap crap. I buy 5 pairs a year for low end usage and if I can get a season out of them I'm happy.. these are so bad I wont even wear them🤨
1.0,"I will be returning this top, the coloring is so off, its not vibrant at all. Feels like cheap material too.  So bummed."
1.0,Ordered an Xl I normally wear a size 10 in pants and weigh 175 lbs and I couldn’t even get the undies over my thighs
1.0,"The hat had a small slit in it, but I brought it on a trip anyways. The hat ended up completely breaking after wearing it for about an hour. I had to toss it because it unraveled, completely unsalvagavable. It was the first time I wore it."
1.0,"The large doesnt fit and the colour is not what i expected ,... there was an issue with the zipper as well."
1.0,The material of the shirt is not very good quality and the shape is very awkward because it flares out at the bottom.
1.0,This runs really small this is not proper size
1.0,"Terrible product, they completely slide down your face (and off your nose and mouth) if you are talking.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,No sitches or anything. Very cheap quality and everythin is heated on to it including stitches.. yikes
1.0,Terrible product. I wrote a true review but Amazon refused to publish it.
1.0,It only works for Amazon women
1.0,"The legs and butt area were sheer on these shorts. I will not be able to wear them outside of the house, and am struggling to understand how they are labeled as workout shorts when they are see-through. I will be returning them."
1.0,Terrible product
1.0,I was very disappointed with this product. Was very faded & looks used
1.0,"This is garbage. Tacky, heavy, itchy and ugly. Go elsewhere... This item blows."
1.0,"Very poor quality, very cheap and flimsy. Christmas gift for my son and it's already broken. Do not buy unless it's going to sit on a shelf."
1.0,This device lasted one time.. one twist to tight and busted… such a bummer I really wanted to use this!!!
1.0,What should be blue is purple in this kilt. I will be returning it - not clan colors!
1.0,I was really excited to wear these and sadly took them out of their packaging and ran out of the house with them so I can’t return them. They fit terrible! They have a really tight waist strap that looks super awkward and the rest is way too big and bulky. Just really bad fit.
1.0,I never exposed thusbring to chemicals or water and it tarnished very quickly.
1.0,Item was delivered damaged with each divider bent up. The cases don’t fit oversized sunglasses.
1.0,"Very disappointed. I was under the impression that the two texts selected were for both sides of the keychain. It does not signify “keychain” or “box” in the customization window. So I have a keychain with a name, and a box with a date, so the gift is beyond pointless to give."
1.0,The material is cheap rough and the sleeves don’t fit right.
1.0,Materials very thin truth and to have cuts and slices
1.0,Too complicated for the purpose!
1.0,"I did not like this item what so ever! The color is almost a pee color, very ugly and tight fit even though I sized up. Returned for a refund!"
1.0,Metal flaked
1.0,"Great looking pants but nowhere the rigjt sizing....too short and tight  in crotch....im a 34 waist, 32 length and should have gone up a full size on both."
1.0,I ordered an XL which is my usual size. It was WAY  TOO SMALL!
1.0,"Wrong item, not as described in picture"
1.0,"not the fabric shown in the pic.., its like the cheap plastic cotton? horrible."
1.0,"no plastic inserts on these clips! junk! I only have a few expensive sweaters, would never use these on them! Waste of money! not worth sending back"
1.0,"While the material is really light and comfortable, this mask COMPLETELY fogs my glasses, even with just normal breathing through my nose. I bought them for the ""no fog"" promise, but that quickly didn't work out.<br /><br />I'm keeping them in case I have a friend or worker (who doesn't wear glasses) comes over who forget their mask, and they can use these.<br /><br />But the ""no fog"" description is not accurate or true…at least from my experience. Disappointing for sure. I really wanted the simple, clean design of the mask to work."
1.0,This dress is a shapeless sack. It made my boobs look terrible and did nothing for my body. The material is cheap feeling and holds onto wrinkles. Pass on this one.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, don’t buy"
1.0,"Hat is crap. the SG-1 ""ptach"" is a paper sticker. Do not buy"
1.0,"The bottoms were wayyy to small and the top was wayyy to large. I'm a b cup and 41 around the hips. I got a large, but returned it right away."
1.0,"The material felt very cheap, I returned it. On a good note it was long enough. I'm 5'11&#34;."
1.0,Are these children's sizes? WAY too small. Overpriced and TERRIBLY sized. I purchased an EXTRA LARGE when I wear a small in everything else and I cannot get a single button buttoned.
1.0,"I have never been so disappointed in a product on amazon. This dress, which is suppose to fit loosely, it way way way too tight up top even after ordering the righg size. Additionally it is basiclly made out of mesh and is completely transparent and unwearable without an entire outfit under it. I tried to return it and the seller did not even get back to me when I had to “request a return” (I wish amazon gave you a warning when you order clothing that doesn’t fit the same return policy as literally everything else). I filed a claim and only then did they get back to me. Told me I had to pay $11 to return this mosquito net of a dress that is literally nothing like they claimed it would be. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"This item was ordered to be a new product, the one I received has been used, worn, and shows cracks in the leather. First disappointed purchase ever made from Amazon."
1.0,Came broken in the package and was really cheap and bendable !!!
1.0,Very very small. Doesn't even fit my 12 yr old. Ugh!
1.0,"Not as described. Don't pay attention to the pictures in the description , it's cheap material and the beard is awful. Don't expect to get a refund either..  they'll offer one but will never send a return label. Now we are stuck with a Santa suit that we will never use."
1.0,The band is too wide for a jean belt loop. It's a struggle to get them throw the loops. Then there is the locking mechanism. It has teeth which clams in to the belt cloth which when disengaging the teeth catch on the belt's material and causes snags. Not good. What makes this a fail is the locking mechanism. My present older one works on a clam mechanisming and friction. Which is what you want.
1.0,Does not fit as well as the ones sold in the stores.
1.0,The chain on this pendant was kinked in several places. What a disappointment.
1.0,"I purchased these in a size 12 for my tall slim 9 year old boy. I usually order that size and it fits with room. This product ran very small. I should have ordered 2 sizes up. I wasn’t that impressed with the skeleton pjs, the glow wasn’t very bright. I probably won’t buy anything from this brand again."
1.0,Straight trash do not buy the fabric is garbage and I ordered a XL and they sent a medium.
1.0,I returned the white floral because its unlined and too sheer. Especially for a toddler to wear.
1.0,Size runs super small. NOT sweatshirt material. Very thin. Took forever to arrive.
1.0,"I went up a size because some people said it runs small, but there is no room in the chest area if you are large busted.  The elastic was in the middle of my chest and when I pulled it down and then moved it just snapped up again.  If you are on the larger sized and have ample bosom, skip this dress.  Really disappointed because I love the color!"
1.0,Not as expected! Too small / tight
1.0,If you have a big face dont buy them.
1.0,I thought I was ordering a cardigan as pictured in the description.  I decided to keep the pullover I received because I was too lazy to deal with the hassle of returning the merchandise.
1.0,"The second hand fell off at 50 days... It's not a super expensive watch, and I do wear the watch most days. However, I would have expected this watch to last more than two months."
1.0,Size was not correct. And we have to pay shipping costs to return (after we paid shipping costs for delivery)
1.0,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. CAN'T EVEN RETURN.
1.0,way too see through....looks nothing like the pic.
1.0,Very little support. Seam was open on one side
1.0,It broke already :(
1.0,"I love the colors, but material is cheesy and flimsy."
1.0,"Ordered as a deal of the day. The product I got was not the drop necklace described but a long chain with pearls. Too late to return because it is a gift. Very disappointed. The necklace I got was pretty, but not what I wanted."
1.0,"The item description showed a zip closed top, but there is no zipper on the tote bag.  The zipper was one of the main factors in my decision to order the bag."
1.0,Did not like this product it was cheap material and not made like the picture shows.
1.0,It didn't have a loose fit.  The picture is deceptive.
1.0,Very tight even though it was my usual size. Cups not shaped right.
1.0,Dont buy this. 1) It broke today before I was going to take a proctored LSAT practice test. The pin to start the time has a design flaw and gets to lushed in so it is almost impossible to pull out to change the time which is needed to do when you change sections. I eventually got it out tofsy but it csme out completely. When I pushed it bsck in it couldn't rotate the arms. This watch sucks. 2) My LSAT instructor previously told me thst I shouldnt use this as it may get me flagged when I take the actual LSAT.
1.0,"BEWARE! I bought this thinking that it was a necklace, but it was a bracelet. Which ok, it was a gift so it might have been ok, except it's also tiny! More child sized than for adults. So I returned it, and now the seller or amazon won't refund my money. Buy at your own risk!"
1.0,This dress was so poorly made and so cheap feeling. I order a lot of clothes off Amazon and have never been this disappointed. I would never wear this out in public ever. Returning.
1.0,"Was SO SO Disappointed in the purchase of this shirt.  Read the reviews saying a ""bit"" small but OK or ""true t size"", but that was absolutely NOT the case with the shirt I purchased.  The material did NOT give or stretch at all and this shirt was at least two sized too small."
1.0,I just bought these December 7. Today I noticed they the shoe came apart :(
1.0,"I was super disappointed in this product.  I wanted the black butterfly wings as pictured and instead, I got blue fairy wings (yes...there is a difference and it's in the shape).  When I opened the product, glitter fell all over the place.  More on the floor than on the wings."
1.0,"This is cheap material and HUGE, even though I ordered a small."
1.0,Pocket placement is right on the hip.  Very unflattering!
1.0,"The dress is gorgeous but according to the size guide a 10 (my normal size) would fit and my entire vag was showing because it wouldn't go over my hips. Aside from that, its beautiful. A 1 star is a must due to this mishap because although I will get a refund, I will NOT be reimbursed shipping (no fault of my own). This would have been a 5 star if it weren't for the sizing so off that it can't even be worn! I would love to get another (probably a 14 or 16) but then I would have to have a ton of alterations done and out even more for more shipping. I'll have to decide if it is worth it or not :("
1.0,Jeesh...I thought I was ordering swim trunks not boxer breifs...<br /><br />They feel good. The fit is exactly what I expected. I just can't get over how short they are. Let's just say you ain't hiding nothing.
1.0,Skirt keeps riding up & it’s too short.
1.0,Once again size is made for someone foreign not in USA
1.0,"Bracely is falling apart already.  Only have had it 4 1/2 months.  String closure is not securely adhered to the bracelet, just tied around it.  Would like a refund or new bracelet."
1.0,This dress runs really big and did not come with a belt. It looks like a nightgown.<br />I ordered a medium for my daughter and we’ll have to make some major alterations to make it work.
1.0,Bought a small but it’s huge! I’m 5’2 and 135lbs and it’s unflattering. It’s boxy looking. Quality isn’t as expected either. I don’t recommend.
1.0,Not a snap back it's Velcro and big
1.0,"It's a bag,not dress.Bad quality of material ,I got this for sister b-day.Big NO !!!!"
1.0,The socks tend to fall down and the treads do not cover the whole foot.
1.0,Didn’t like the design
1.0,"As another reviewer wrote, after relatively few uses (less than a season) one of the soles came completely unglued and peeled off. I've tried to glue it back on as an interim fix until we can get a new pair of shoes, but I'm not super optimistic. Won't buy this model again, and I'm used to thinking of Adidas as a trustworthy brand. This does nothing to uphold that reputation"
1.0,Cheap material and shipping time was terrible.
1.0,Plastic lense was melted!
1.0,Pants run a bit big in body and dont hold their shape. They also run very short.
1.0,The loop doesn’t hold ur pen! We returned
1.0,Too small tried to return did not happen. Will never buy from this company again.
1.0,Screw fell out first day.  Belt is made of rubber which I was willing to accept....but it can't be used now.
1.0,Very poor quality one time use only. shrink and color fade after 1st wash
1.0,"Beautiful watch, horrible craftsmanship. It broke right out of the box. Contacted customer service, they were &#34;out of the band&#34; and said I would have to wait &#34;several days&#34; for a replacement. Then I didn't hear back from them as to if or when they would be replacing it. I would save my money and buy a kid's watch at Walmart."
1.0,If you are a big person then you shouldn't buy this. Everything was tight and too small. nothing stretches.
1.0,The inner lining ripped so badly in multiple places that it's useless after only 2 weeks. This bag is perfect in theory --  I love the pockets and size. Pretty bummed.
1.0,This ring is a Christmas present. The pic you have here is the wrong image
1.0,"These are NOT worth the money. I needed more masks and thought these were worth a go based on the reviews. I don't like anything about them. They are hard to breathe in and VERY hard to hear people talking with these on. Everything you say with this mask on is very muffled. The size was fine for me and my husband, but they aren't exactly comfortable. Really wish I could return these.... Save your money and buy the Tommie Copper masks."
1.0,I like the bracelet but it got tarnished eventhough I left it in the pouch.
1.0,"The jeepers came rounded and with no shape, making it Uncomfortable to wear.<br />I have bought these keepers before and never had thia issue."
1.0,"Item was very very small, couldn’t try it on"
1.0,This broke 3 days after I got it.
1.0,The lenses were crap. Like someone “cleaned” them with sand paper. They’re nothing more than a dash decoration.
1.0,The glasses itself are cute. They are a bit overly Oversized for my face. But still cute. Very cheaply made. Very fragile! Comes with case and cleaning cloth.
1.0,"This tank top did not fit me well at all. It was too long, too wide, and had way too much material. Wasn’t super happy with my purchase."
1.0,Cheaply made. Spend the extra bucks for “Clic” brand
1.0,The clasp is what I was looking for but half the size of the type I wanted.
1.0,That so darn tiny you can hardly see them. Maybe sized for an infant.
1.0,huge not nice at all
1.0,"I would not recomend this product. Cheap Old leather that has been patched where the zippered compartment is located, making a crease that sticks out. The leather has so much oil product on it that you cant stand the smell, it gives me a migrain.Also no insert for duplicate checks. Not what I thought I purchased."
1.0,The inner sole ripped.  No longer able to use.  Too costly for this to happen.  Already trashed.
1.0,sunglasses were broken in multiple places. Only came with one arm on.
1.0,Bought this for my husband for work and it won’t even keep the correct time.
1.0,I was expecting some work out pants. That’s the last things are
1.0,It looks NOTHING like the picture. I'm a size 2 and bought a small and it fits like a large. It just didn't fit right to give a sleek sexy finish. This was one of the dresses I bought on amazon that was a disappointment!!!
1.0,I purchased this skirt according to the size chart I’d recommend you go maybe 2 sizes up. Beautiful skirt tho.
1.0,"I’m so disappointed because this piecing is so cute, but it came in broken. The right side is also longer than the left side. I don’t think it was damaged during shipping. It came in like this, which makes me think it might’ve been used. It  definitely does not seem new."
1.0,Sizing sucks!!!<br />Ordered a 2xl. It ended being the size of a medium!!!!!<br />Bad choice on my part. Stay clear of these!!!!
1.0,Cheap.  Not optic quality.  If you can tolerate them they are cute and light.
1.0,The hat appeared to be not good quality & they shipped it in just a plastic shipping bag & the hat was all flattened out.
1.0,I couldn’t get it to close or hang like in the picture. I tried 2 sizes.
1.0,"These are tissue thin, very cheap quality. I've used paper bibs for years for my disabled daughter, and these are the worst I've bought. I found very good ones at Assisted Living Store.com - a pack of 300. I think Assisted Living sells them through Amazon as well. These bibs here - SNL Quality Disposable bibs are useless."
1.0,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. Seriously, keep looking for your Halloween costume. Like most things on Amazon, the picture is better than what arrives. Came in a plastic package via China Post labeled ""banner"". Extremely disappointed when opened. It looks like a child made it in crafts class. This may be passable at a costume party where everyone is too drunk to care, or wandering in the dark during trick or treat, but I'm probably going to head to Michael's to see if I can fix the wings. I tossed the headband that came with the wings right in the trash -- where it belonged."
1.0,"Was really tight and way too padded. Made my boobs look bigger of course, but I hate all that padding. This oyem was definitely not for me. Material looked nice although i didn't realize side support ment it would have four rows of hooks!!! Way to much!!!"
1.0,Sizing runs way small
1.0,If they lasts 3 months I will be surprised
1.0,Just ackward! Definitely will not purchase again. Didn't fit my newborn and now she has grown and it fits but it just looks ackward.
1.0,The stone although pretty it may be is very poorly constructed. Not sure of the process the company uses but it’s definitely not it’s original state of stone. After a few weeks it just detaches from itself in the middle of the rock. i thought it may have been a fluke and i ordered a replacement which the company kindly obliged however after a couple of weeks the same exact thing happened again. i am very disappointing i would never order another stone from them again. that’s my experience hopefully yours will be a better one....
1.0,"The dress was correct, only it was the wrong color AND there was a rip in a seam."
1.0,i ordered these and got one small mitten and one medium mitten
1.0,This was not worth the $$$ made really cheap & it is loose falls off my wrist all the time! Next time I drop it I won’t pick it up.
1.0,"Cheap garbage.  These &#34;reading&#34; glasses would barely pass as costume glasses- if one could see through them. The lenses appear as if you were looking through a hazy, warped piece of plastic. All-plastic hinges. They feel like toy glasses.  THese are certainly NOT reading lenses."
1.0,horrible!
1.0,Does not get warm at all
1.0,Horrible fitting do not go by there list do not buy cheap merchandise
1.0,It smells like fish.  It is super super cheaply made.
1.0,Terrible material and doesn't look anything like the picture
1.0,"To tight could not pull them up.. Need. 0 to 5 mg.<br />Gave all of them away,"
1.0,"These thongs are made from a nice quality fabric and have a cute design. However, they’re sewn very poorly in the back (seams don’t match up/crooked) and one came with the bow sewn on backwards. Very disappointed. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Absolutely is not the jacket in the photo.  The denim has very cloth quality to it, uniform in color, and is much more of a plain blue rather than denim color.  Think of the most stereotypical, comfortable mom jeans and that is this denim material.  Also the buttons are not metal as show in the photo.  The jacket in the photo looks awesome, what is shipped is very plain and of low quality."
1.0,"cheap, HUGE and color is off. Buckle was gold, I think? Weird color... returned it."
1.0,When I bought this item I looked at the reviews and was sold. Until I got it in the mail :( this item looks and feels really cheap the box it comes in looks even cheaper everything went right in the trash can
1.0,I've had to fix it twice just keeps falling apart and is broken for the third time... Dont wanna fix again... Guess you get what you paid for with this one...
1.0,So I ordered the product and I ordered it in large I washed it and when I took it out of the washing machine not sure if it trunk or not because I didn’t really try it before usually size large that’s what fits but it was way too tight so if you order order two sizes bigger  don’t order the size that you usually wear and it also comes from China so that’ll tell you a lot I was not able to return it like I said I had washed it so now I’m gonna have to keep it not very happy will not order again
1.0,Received broken earring
1.0,bad product
1.0,This was HUGE up top. I’m a 34 C so I ordered a Medium. It was literally for someone twice my size up top. The bottom and waist were okish but the top was awkwardly huge. Don’t size up and great for anyone with small waist and big jugs!
1.0,Third time buying this and has broken within three months every time
1.0,"Color was not as described, it was glittery and really thin material. Ordered M, runs small"
1.0,This top is made like the picture. But is an extremely poor version of it. The fabric is very soft and flimsy! The shoulder piece which is the best part of the top has raw edges. This blouse that is very cheap looking!!!
1.0,This bathing suit is cute but completely see though when wet totally unexceptable! You can see everything thought this swim suit and I was embarrassed for my kid we had no alternative! Bad material !
1.0,"They were purple, not navy, sent them back"
1.0,Poor fitment.  The ear socks just roll around on the frames.
1.0,"First of all, I purchased the rust colored sweater and it’s a weird bright orange color. Not what is pictured at all. Secondly, the sleeves are way to small and the midsection is way too large. Save your money and don’t purchase this."
1.0,"Bought these for a second time. The first time they were great, second time might as well throw your money out the window. Unless you want to feel dizzy all day. Dont buy them."
1.0,"Poor quality! With the white underside, you barely touch the front of the fabric and a white blemish appears on the surface from the back of the material. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"Funny color, not grey at all.  Won't use it.  Donating."
1.0,"These earrings and delicate and beautiful. The attach by inserting in earring hole and then sliding 1/4 inch wire backs along the back of the ear. The problem is that they fall down all day long, then just hanging from the hole like regular earrings. Even if you really clamp them down hard (ouch!) bending the metal to grip your ear, they fall down within an hour."
1.0,"Bracelet is advertised as being 9"". I have thick wrists. The one I got was 6""."
1.0,Color faded on the yellow and purple after the first wash using gentle detergent and delicate cycle.
1.0,I bought the dress after seeing the pictures of it and the comments .. but I'm disappointed because the dress I received is not the one of the photos and is not worth what I paid
1.0,I received a completely wrong and different item
1.0,"unfortunately the watch does not work..<br />I very much like the look.<br />I removed the stem stop when it arrived,<br />set the correct time and  found a few minutes<br />later it had stopped.. This happened several times....i have given up and will be returning it."
1.0,Extremely cheap products<br />2 or the 6 gloves total already had poor stitching and it resulted in holes<br />Stay away. Poor products
1.0,"I was so excited to get these boots but unfortunately they shipped 2 very different sizes. One shoe fit well, a little big.  The other shoe was gigantic.  Also, there wasn't a size printed anywhere on or in the shoe, so I have no clue what the actual sizes are.<br />Very disapointed!"
1.0,I wanted it for a 70 birthday party .anything I ever bought from you guys for myself never fitted always have to give it away .All your dresses are too small or too big
1.0,Little comb kept popping off. Takes far too long on a wet head. Flimsy. Not worth it. Did little to smooth out mildly curly hair.
1.0,I've worn the tan belt 4 times and the leather is already cracked and showing white.  I guess this is really reflects the addage &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;
1.0,"Is marked on the inside: &#34;Not for walking babies&#34;.  Returned, what good are shoes the kid isn't supposed to walk in?"
1.0,"I used these for winter bike riding. the fog up in about 30 seconds, even with &#34;cat crap&#34; on the lenses. don't waste your money"
1.0,The center nose bridge isn't permanently attached & comes apart very easy. I had to just use a zip tie in it's place between the 2 lenses. Unfortunately I bought 3 pair at once UGH
1.0,it wasn't the round shape like in photo. mine came out all straight and defected.
1.0,This runs about 2 sizes smaller than advertised.
1.0,"The quality of the item is cheap and the size did not fit. When I requested a return, the seller informed me the cost of shipping is high so to give the product to a friend or family member because maybe they will like it. I was not given the option to return. These glasses are not worth the headache. Buyer beware."
1.0,Item description said 400 pc Magicare masks. Only recieved 20 masks per order. They are NOT Magicare. They are not even the style pictured. Listing later changed. Rip-off.
1.0,"Item received with bad wrinkles. Washed, dried and tried again. The wrinkles do not come out!"
1.0,I usually wear small/medium and ordered a medium. When it arrived it seemed like a child’s sized shirt. Was definitely not oversized like advertised in the picture. Returning.
1.0,Loved the way it was made but terribly small in size.  I could not get it on my shoulders
1.0,Hated it was a misfit
1.0,"Very cheap looking, not at all like what is pictured"
1.0,Small. Painful<br />Disappointing
1.0,"These are yellow, not white!"
1.0,Very disappointed did not look like the picture at all did have a V-neck material was not what I was expecting. I purchased it to wear under something with it a deep V-neck this was like something I would get at Walmart. Thought it would be a little more up class. It was just like a regular T-shirt with a small V-neck. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,Runs very small and short. No stretch either.
1.0,Extremely cheap! Broke during FIRST WEAR
1.0,It said it would bring the tights but they were not included
1.0,Doesn't keep the watch running.  Would not recommend.
1.0,Poor quality. I put it on and the zipper broke immediately. The pattern was adorable and I had saved it for a trip. Really disappointed.
1.0,Very poor quality. Shirt is at least one size too small which usually is the case for poor quality clothing.
1.0,"Thin see-thru material, fits small"
1.0,"Just ugly, had to by underskirt to give it any body at all. photo very decieving. good throw away."
1.0,"Way too large.  Not sure who it’s made for.  Like seriously large.  Don’t waste your money.  If you’re looking for a large mask, look no further.  If you have a normal size head, keep looking."
1.0,"This dress is not velvet and the ""wrap"" feature of this dress makes it more of a cape than a dress. I ordered a large and could not fit it halfway around my body let alone to wrap it as a dress.  It was incredibly long and I don't think it would have fit even the tallest and skinniest person."
1.0,Poor quality.  Flimsy thin material.  Don’t buy this product.
1.0,Ordered this product a couple weeks ago and went on vacation. When I came back and went to use this it broke and now it’s too late to return. Don’t recommend!
1.0,Does not get hot at all. Waste of money!!
1.0,"We bought this for a wedding, he normally wears a 10/12 so i bought a 14 just to be safe and he can’t even get the pants up past his legs they are so small. The tie is also broken."
1.0,This swimsuit has size issues.  I measured and ordered the size it said but when I received it boy was I shocked.  Not even close to what it says.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8aef1b908cd498512d7d6369696c0c81]] Came in a bag that was already ripped open and just tapped shut. Had four different deodorant spots on it. Absolutely disgusting.
1.0,The sizing on these are way off.  You need to order 2 sizes up.
1.0,Upside down.
1.0,Was super thin and short. The picture doesn't look anything like it.
1.0,Wearing this shirt for the first time today.  Noticed that it is already coming apart at the seams.  Poor quality.  Would not recommend that you buy this.
1.0,SweatyRocks' return policy is non-exist.  I pay $10 to return these pants directly to SweatyRocks.  I have received $0 in refund!!! You better make sure you are getting an item that fits perfectly because there is NO REFUND. (This was the second pair I ordered in this size.  The sizing is inconsistent.)
1.0,Earrings looked very expensive but post and back didnt fit.  Had to return
1.0,not the correct size
1.0,"Ordered XXL to fit  50 inch chest. The shirt was way too small to fit my husband so to prove a point, I tried it on. I’d say it fit a woman’s medium."
1.0,I liked the size and look of it. The spring broke the third time I opened it.
1.0,Play two large nothing I would ever wear
1.0,Half of them broke as soon as they were removed from the packaging. Were going to be used for a group costume and couldn't use them all.
1.0,Zero stars. Cheaply made. Nothing like the picture. Sizing sucks. I'm trying to get a refund and getting the run around. They keep asking me to give it as a gift. I would be embarrassed to give such cheesy crap as a gift. I will never order from here again. As a single mom of two boys I rarely buy myself anything. I literally cried I was so disappointed.
1.0,This is pretty but I cannot wear it because the toggle is too small and slides out of the ring.  So now it sits there unused. Disappointing.
1.0,The connection of the logo piece broke after few weeks. Waste of money.
1.0,"I got a clear bangle which was good but all the gems in the purple r falling out, so sad."
1.0,The colors are much brighter in person and it is made out of a cheap fabric that was not giving at all.
1.0,I bought 2 of these for me and my bro so we can harness our powers in our JO crystals but I think these are plastic. We can’t harness our JO power with plastic.
1.0,This is not a maxi dress; hits at the calf. This is an empire waist; not a natural waist as pictured. Completely different than pictured.
1.0,Material is like paper must wear undergarments because if a wind storm kick up or ALL of your cookies will be exposed.
1.0,Filter section does not cover nose.. Mask covers nicely however if you breathe through your nose no carbon filter protection.. Poorly designed..<br />Waste of money..
1.0,No good 😕

1.0,Just isn’t right. Not according to normal  Anatomy of the hand :(
1.0,The blouse is pretty and fits very well but the fabric in gray color is awful it gets stains with almost everything and they wont go away. Bad quality.

1.0,Ripped after one snowboarding session!!!!!!!!

1.0,The jeans that came were not the same as the picture.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I received the siren song but I am having trouble trying to put the batteries in it. I hadn't got it open yet.
1.0,Love the look of the cover but cant use since the volume buttons dont work with this case and impossible to take screenshots. The factory charger doesnt even fit.
1.0,"I'm 5'4"", 120#, and ordered a small. The shoulder seems were half way to my elbows. The sleeves fell way past my fingertips. I expected it to be longer, at least almost to my knees, and it fell just below my butt cheeks."
1.0,Strap broke at the airport on one side my first time using.  Very poor quality.  So disappointing!
1.0,Did not like it.  Cheap made. The zipper hard to close
1.0,They look nice but broke a week later!!!
1.0,WAAAAAY too small.  I wear a standard US 1X (18/20) and ordered a XXXL according to chart conversion.  I would say it was maybe a XL.  But you get what you pay for I suppose.👎🏼
1.0,This is horrible worst tube top the fabric feels like a piece of paper very stretchy but also too small I was expecting something below my belly button the white one is kind of see through

1.0,All 3 times the center stone has fallen out with in 2 weeks<br /><br />Beautiful but wobt last
1.0,"The cuff is for someone with big ears and it simply does not fit right on anyones ear. I bought it for my daughter and it wouldnt hook on her ear it was to big, my ears are bigger and i tried it and it wouldnt hook over my ear right then I had a friend with ears a little bigger than mine and it was to small. Not worth buying"
1.0,Majorly see through
1.0,"TINT TINY TINY. I don’t have a ruler so I used a regular sized scissors so you can see it’s maybe 6 inches long. This is kids clothes, not for adults. I couldn’t even pull it over my ankle"
1.0,Picture shows this as the stones being solid. They are not. They are not completely see through but you can definitely see whatever color you have behind this  necklace. I was not very happy with that as I wanted the stone to be completely solid!
1.0,Well these frames did not work. When I took these frames in to have  my prescription put in them I was told that they were not able to use these frames.  Because of a disclaimer right on the lenses that come in the frames. “COLD GLAZE RECOMMEND”. Therefore no one would allow us to use them.  A little disappointing considering I thought they were very cool frames. Now we will have to send them back.
1.0,"I would give this 0 starts if I could. I was disappointed with these. Usually I'll wear a pair of faux gauges and leave it on for months, without worrying about it. The wood is cheap, so showering or swimming with these is a not a good idea. After a while I got a red rash on the back of my ear. I swapped the pair I was wearing with another one of these and the hole to screw it on was too small, so then I tried the last pair, and same thing. Can't wear 2 pairs, and one gave me rash, don't waste your money."
1.0,"I ordered a bunch of dresses/sets/skirt like this one. All about $20-30. They were all super cheap material. Almost plastic like. Ew! Horrible feeling, horrible look and the fabric even makes noise when you move. Its also very thin so in the sun you can see thru. I am 32DD, 25 waist and 37 hips. I got an XS- The top fit ok, the skirt is long- I am 5'7 and had to pull it very high waist to make it a decent/cute length. The skirt didn't compliment my body at all, made me look larger and not in a good way. Definitely avoid. All the smocked and cute/flowery items on amazon are super cheap- you can get better and cheaper items at forever 21 or local boutiques. I gave this 2 stars since its not completely horrible- it does look like pictures."
1.0,"I like the design, but the way the earrings hang is not right for me. They stick out and I can’t seem to make it better by bending the wire. Would not buy again."
1.0,This dress was not what I expected. I was excited to purchase this dress. Im upset I wasted my money on this item. The material is cheap and see through. I definitely threw this dress in the trash.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. Had high hopes but one of the gold plates was dented/tarnished, and the earring was not even straight - hung crooked. Returning these."
1.0,In the description it had 31 inch inseam. When I received my order they are tall. I will be returning them.
1.0,My wife said the thickness is perfect but the fabric layer is peeling at the edges (away from the foam cups) after only 2 washes. (The cups were placed inside a lingerie laundry bag & set to a regular cycle spin & then air dried.) I can't recommend this item to anyone nor would I purchase it again.
1.0,The material is like a Halloween costume. Gross. Returning!
1.0,Super heavy not good for your bike key will damage tank

1.0,I can’t put on alone they are so rounded it is to hard to clasp
1.0,Not as pictured.  Very cheap material
1.0,Way too small. Not adult sizes at all.
1.0,The waistband is too tight and not very soft and the fabric didn’t cover what we want covered.
1.0,Returned because they look really bad on.
1.0,This product is not the color they stated in the picture nor does it fit true to size at all. I am 5’1 and 107 lbs and this is a small fits like a large in my opinion. I am really disappointed on the misleading color they stated it was. Definitely not apricot this is a cream color. Not worth the price at all.
1.0,"Chubby toes need not buy. Super cute shoe, way too snug for a wider foot.<br />Cute pointed toe would be cute on long skinny foot....caused some serious chubby toe cleavage comparable to a shoe version of a mushroom top"
1.0,The tongue ripped off completely the first time my son put the shoe on
1.0,Wrong size. These are way too small. Definitely not 18G.
1.0,Cheap fabric and had strings hanging off of them.  Definitly not one size fits all.
1.0,"Nothing like the picture,don't buy!!!"
1.0,Sent hat back. Was damaged!
1.0,Strap material is not great in comparison to other bands purchased on Amazon.
1.0,To tight to fit over her heal
1.0,"While this dress looks great on the model, the pattern wasn't adjusted for larger sizes, so ultimately it just looked silly and almost like a sack dress with a pretty pattern.  Returned right away"
1.0,Quality of fabric not good<br />Doesn’t look like in the picture<br />I had a coupon 70% off so ok for what I paid
1.0,"Lasted a good month ,and the zipper stop working"
1.0,Way too small. Ordered an xl was more like a medium! Very disappointed!
1.0,"they said that the short would have long sleeves, and they were half sleeve.  Also the material is crappy and when I tried to return it they said I had to pay an extra $5 for shipping do not buy the product absolutely horrible"
1.0,Necklace heavy;rubies look like plastic.
1.0,Returned this item. Looked very cheap and not at all as advertised.
1.0,Very small fit. I had to return it.
1.0,These are extremely small. They are more than half a size smaller than advertised. They are not comfortable. There is hard plastic poking into the back of the heel.
1.0,Am I the only one who is totally disgusted with the straps on this napsack? I had my daughter order me one and the straps are all tangled and very annoying as you put the napsack on they move and adjust to where u have to take it off and adjust them again. Maybe mine was defective! I hate this bag!
1.0,This is for the musical Wicked.  NOT LOST!
1.0,Was damaged wen arrived 😢
1.0,The dresses are way smaller than the size you order. I ordered a large and it's more like a small.
1.0,"The picture looks a lot nicer than the actual product.  It had to be assembled, and the pieces did not fit together well. It took awhile to screw them in, and the tops of the upright pieces are sharp.  I tried to tighten the upright bars, but then the bars across the top do not fit into the groove on the other pieces, so the upright bars have to be kept somewhat loose, making the overall structure very wobbly.  Some bars are bent, so when fully assembled, the bars are crooked and not evenly aligned.  It comes in a plain box marked &#34;Made in China,&#34; with no other labels or descriptions so it makes me wonder just what the metal is made of.  It also has a big huge metal leaf hanging on one of the bars that says &#34;My Gift,&#34; which is not shown in the picture.  I would return it, but I'd pay almost as much in shipping to do so.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on this.  It's junk."
1.0,only had 3 months zipper broke on both bags
1.0,The material is cheap and the fit is too small!
1.0,had em for a day and the hinge came off<br />wouldn't recommend these glasses because<br />they break too quickly. they were kind of stylish i guess but they cost too much
1.0,The directions say to peel off the white strip from the back... it doesn’t remove and leave the foam side intact.
1.0,Design has no workable adjustment to fit tight and snug on any size case. Not a good choice.
1.0,"Thin, cheaply made."
1.0,"Pilled all over after wearing it for like 4 hours. Doing nothing but sitting at a desk! Very thin, too bad I really wanted it. But I wore it so can’t return it :(( Don’t buy unless it’s a one shot deal and it’s warm"
1.0,Broke within the first month.
1.0,See photo: My orange Telic Z straps are a women’s size 8. I ordered a black pair (W8) and as you can see in the photo they are much smaller and didn’t have any tags on them. Perhaps they were not genuine Telics.
1.0,I bought this for my two year old and it is way too big so I sent it back I didn’t realize baby shark was for adults to
1.0,"This ""blazer"" looks and feels more like a tee shirt. You get what you pay for. This item is cheaply priced because it is of such poor quality. Stay away!"
1.0,Looks like they are for adults but are made for a child.  Our heads are not that big but these were way to small.
1.0,Do not waste your money on this item.  I had the wallet less than a week before it started peeling and snap tore off!
1.0,It didn't seem bad until I saw this weird mark in the daylight. Flawed material. Disappointed
1.0,Got stuck I'm my ear to where I had to ice it down until husband got home. Would not recommend.
1.0,Broke after a week of use. Very disappointed.
1.0,I'm a men's size 10 shoe and I cannot put these on. They are listed as adult shoe size 6-12. Disappointed I'm out $10.
1.0,Stain on earrings
1.0,"I read this in other reviews and I should have listened. Never in my life have I tried boots and they were too tight on my calfs, because I feel like my calfs are perfectly normal sized. But sure enough these boots were impossiblely tight in my calfs, then bunch around my ankles, and fit fine in the foot. Returned and didn't re order."
1.0,Ring is not white as shown in photo but very greenish yellow. Not at all like in photo. Other than that seems to have nice quality. I’m looking for a ring like the one in photo so chose to return it.
1.0,I literally just got this for my husband and they broke. I do no recommend!
1.0,"Big Problem! Pockets are sewn in upside down! Kind of useless for golf when you cant put balls, tees or markers in a pocket. No thanks!"
1.0,Even a 3rd grader I tutor found them to be too tight.
1.0,Wavy lenses. Literally made me dizzy wearing them.
1.0,"Too big, sending back"

1.0,Doesn't fit comfortably  not what I expected
1.0,OK but not good by any means
1.0,Both bracelets broke the first day. I’m very disappointed with the quality. This was a special gift for my daughter and a friend.
1.0,Cheap garbage
1.0,"Nope big nope for me ...,"
1.0,"So not recommend it at all! Looks like a gumball jewel , very cheap looking! Gave it to my daughter to play with. Looks better online then in real person, don't wast your money on this !😳😬"
1.0,These were literally like a joke.
1.0,WAY<br />Too small
1.0,Ugly Ugly Ugly Ugly Ugly .......nice fast shipping nice easy return. thks amazon.
1.0,After wearing it once the seem tore.
1.0,"Did not like the way it felt or look , it looks cheap"
1.0,"Whoever designed this earring didn't attempt to try them on. The shape of the clasp makes it difficult to put on, painful to close, and the design on the earring is facing toward my neck. In order to see the design, you'd have to put the earring on backward. Made my earlobes hurt to put on a take off. What a disappointment,  don't waste your money"
1.0,en dos días se me pusieron negros
1.0,Made for smaller necks. Looks cheap. Returning.
1.0,"The belt was made in such a stupid way, I'll upload the picture soon  because this thing is hideous and doesn't work the way a belt is supposed to."
1.0,"Fits skintight, like sausage.  Quality reflects it's price. Returns are a problem.  Sometimes they want you to mail them back to China!!! Beware!! Cannot understand the Chinese reps over the phone."
1.0,"I get it. For 12.99, I should have had lower expectations.  But even my 10 year old said, ""Dad, that doesn't look like it has any design on it.""  Nothing special, though It was billed to be.  Again, 12.99 you get what you pay for.  I was looking for a bargain/find, but didn't get it with these."
1.0,"Very poor quality. The sides break easily and the lens scratch easily. I love the style, but need much improvement in quality of materials."
1.0,Had it for two months and the zipper broke.  So disappointed in this product!!!!
1.0,Bought for a Where’s Waldo halloween costume. Returned. Looks like a circus tent.
1.0,"Ordered the blue face watch. Its not blue. Not even close. Its purple not matter how you look at it or whatever lighting you have. Seller informed me it is the correct watch as their is difference in their lighting. Hmm. Looks on site blue, says blue, but it isnt blue. Also jeweler removed a couple links for fitting and informed me the pins were very loose and may not stay. Said in their opinion, yes it looks nice but is very cheap watch and will not last long, and that it is purple too. Lol. 25 bucks what do you expect I guess. Plus over 4 weeks shipping"
1.0,Just got these 4 days ago for my daughter. I cannot believe how this shoe is falling apart and peeling already. Especially the left shoe but the right started to show some peeling today.  Such awful quality.
1.0,I disliked the ankle bracelet because it changed color on the 2nd day after wearing it! It was not 14K gold plated as described! Totally wasted my money!
1.0,"The fabric feels like plastic, is very see through and is sized very incorrectly."
1.0,Put up mid May. August 3rd and the color went from burgundy to pink due to the sun. Not thrilled by the color fade so fast. I didn’t plan on a new umbrella every year.
1.0,"Shipping was long, pay to return"
1.0,This jacket runs really big and it’s off white not white..returned
1.0,I didn't like them. They were too thin and the non skid caused a tripping hazard as it was too capsulating to the floor.  I choose not to return them as the return shipping was more than the cost of the socks.
1.0,I wanted it to be bigger... it seems like a child’s hat
1.0,Very poor quality and finishes. I'll return them...
1.0,The insides fall apart. That was with minimal use.<br />Don't buy. Look elsewhere.
1.0,It was to thin.  Looked like a mans undershirt<br /><br />Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Green ankle
1.0,They were way too thick and not at all attractive.
1.0,"nothing like the image. different material, different fit,different color shade."
1.0,The size is definitely a shot in the dark and the edges are SO SHARP. be super careful or maybe file them down before putting them in your ear holes.
1.0,"These came apart at the toe connection after 3 months, really disappointed with these."
1.0,These are extremely small...the size guide need to be updated...I ordered the 38D...it does not even come close to that. It fits like a 34B. I gave mine to my 15 year old. Not recommended for full size women.
1.0,picture is very hard to see
1.0,Does not look like picture. I bought this one in particular because it had a dark back ground but it doesn't have a dark back ground at all and it's scooped out hollow in the back. Seems expensive for what it is but I needed something to wear and since it was all I had and I no longer have the box I am not returning it.
1.0,I had high hopes but in the end was let down literally. There is no support the cups fit awful and the front buckel will never be tight enough. Skip this product oh and the returns are not free. (It cost me $6 to return them)
1.0,Terrible this was a low profile59 it was shifty too small look for that on sticker buy orig59 if it says low profile I promise it'll be a dummy hat waste of40bucks
1.0,I wanted to love this tee shirt but was shocked when it arrived.  First of all the color wasn't the same blue as shown in their description nor was the design. It just looked like a wrinkled old tee that had two different colors sewn together.  I do not recommend this top; the quality isn't up to par.
1.0,Run large way to baggy for me.<br />Runs short as well.<br />Don't want a item that I have to hand wash lay flat etc. High maintenance for a cheap jogger.
1.0,I ordered an xtra large and it was closer to a medium. Very disappointed.
1.0,"These boots are poor quality and so is the customer service. They are like house shoes and will not hold up in the rain or snow. The boots came covered in either saw dust or cardboard piece. Buyer Beware, they run 1 or 2 sizes small and if you try to send them back they refund you lower than what the Amazon return process tells you your getting. Big Rip Off!"
1.0,I agree with a previous reviewer - very pretty ring but arrived with a stone missing. It wasn't even loose in the bag. I'm returning it but I'm not too inclined to replace it since I'm not confident that the stones are secure.
1.0,"Far too thin, low grade material and extemely tight"
1.0,Wallet came with no money clip as described. No response when I made a complaint with seller.
1.0,It's Too small. Made for a kid unless I shave my head then it would fit. The bill is also really long. Overall just not for me.
1.0,So low quality I couldn’t even wear it in the house.
1.0,no tracking zipper is backwards
1.0,Irritated my ear and the metal turned green and left residue in my ear piercing
1.0,"The stones fall out, I made a complaint and the company replaced it.  The replacement stones fell out just as fast as the first.  Its a beautiful ring, but dont waste your money :("
1.0,"Sadly, the fit wasn't what I expected.  The garment fit too tight. When ordering be sure to know your sizing. The neon color was very striking definitely would stand out in a crowd."
1.0,Instantly started shedding as soon as I took them out of the package. There aren’t soles in this shoe it’s not even padded. Very uncomfortable and the fur is everywhere. Don’t waste your money
1.0,All of the earrings are extremely heavy.  It makes them hard to wear for a long time.  Even the littlest ones are extremely heavy.  Very disappointed
1.0,Bare minimum quality.  Nothing special.
1.0,This does not feel like the others made to look like this. It feels like a foam material.
1.0,didnt fit.  over priced ...tossed them
1.0,"I liked the idea of this bag because it's reusable. But this is irrelevant if it does not do its job in the first place. I used this poorly designed product to transport home a 750ml, capped and wrapped bottle of beer. The beer did not survive. The problem is that no matter how much you inflate the bag, the stantions in place on either side of the neck do not hold the neck of the bottle stably. That leaves the neck unsecured, and able to be jostled inside the air bag.  Bad design for beer bottles."
1.0,zipper broke on day 2
1.0,):
1.0,Not the same as pictured .<br />Fits too big .<br />Very minimal fur ... not at all like photo.<br />Completely different cut around shoulders.<br /><br />Scam
1.0,When I opened the package i realized the package is damaged and the style is wired i purchased it for the colors but it just a waste of money plus it's super thin
1.0,This looks like is a costume for 70’ party returned
1.0,Don't like this at all.  It will not stay clasped to the main part of my watch!  I'm afraid to wear it anywhere bc I'm scared it'll fall off!
1.0,Definitely wasn't too happy with this purchase. I found it to be very itchy and the stitching in various places on the inside were sewn with so much extra material sticking up above the seam that it was scratching at my skin. It was just very annoying and itchy. Definitely wasn't for me. Returned it.
1.0,I ordered this for my husband who is diabetic and has just had surgery. With in a little over 2 weeks the lettering is fading off . I contacted them and they just said use a eraser to bring letters back !!!!!!! I asked for a refund and they told me it looked fine to them !!!!!!!! ( I had sent them a picture )
1.0,Cheap material looks like bicycle chain would not wear it . Fake pictures of actual product looks like when it arrived
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. Waste of money. Even bought a new battery and still won’t work.
1.0,"Back of the shirt is printed backwards.  Very cheap.  Fortunately, got my money back on it."
1.0,"I ordered a size medium for a little room, respectively. The dress I received was huge. I does not lift your breast like the model in the photo! And it is not flattering if you have mom boobs !! Beware any one with saggy mom boobs lol"
1.0,Don’t love the quality of these. The design feels sticky and they don’t seem too comfortable. The long sleeves shirt is too tight around the arms. Overall I didn’t like the set.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:71fe69e8f7e886f45939c053d150f472]] Love the mask I got it for my nephew and this is the second one I requested it will not light up as picture describes and shows. I won’t buy or ask for another but the seller was excellent, I really appreciate what you tried to do but unfortunately I won’t buy another or request another because it seems like they both had shortages or just didn’t work at all."
1.0,"I knew as soon as I picked up the box that the crank was too light for the job.  It broke without turning a single revolution, and it was back in the box and ready to return by the end of the day it arrived.  That was yesterday.  This is my first Amazon return.  We'll see how it goes.  It's possible this thing could work for a small awning such as on an RV, but it certainly failed on my house awning.  I wouldn't chance it even for the RV.  Trouble is, every competing item has a few reviews just like this one, so reviews weren't much help."
1.0,The “look” is exactly to photo if u took a picture but in person super see through and the fabric of both pieces are a weird stretchy material. Sleeves do not have banding on wrists. Overall terrible in person. Returning
1.0,"At first glance these are nice but within a months time, a lens has already popped out"
1.0,Liars
1.0,)is quality. Poor construction. Very disappointed in the whole purse. Difficult to open. Straps are falling apart after only a few month light use
1.0,Don’t buy you’ll be wasting your money... it cost more to send it bac then what u paid for it and it doesn’t have any kind of stretch and not true to size
1.0,Clock doesn't work 1 week after buying. Crap.
1.0,Doesn’t tell tome
1.0,"this is a frail, cover that is not leather. it is a cheap vinyl , i dont know what other folks are getting but i know I received vinyl"
1.0,It didn't go even next day. Screw came out and finally I had to use lot of super glue.
1.0,Cannot use for my purposes... the screw  near the bottom hinge is so sharp on ALL OF THEM.  Never expect that. Shame.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3e8c7e3232873180796adc20c7cc3242]] Why are holes in the shirt? I'm so  mad right now
1.0,Didn't work. it's fake
1.0,"Definitely not as pretty as the picture, more like a dress for a young girl or child. Material does not look like the picture."
1.0,"Very cheap material, the black squares look as if it was spray painted on, it’s definitely not what’s in the pictures, I’m very disappointed"
1.0,It turned color within the first week of wearing.
1.0,I was hoping it was at least a real watch (didn't care about the cheap plastic casing). Instead its a toy with really cheap sound effects. Don't waste the money.
1.0,The quality of this item is much worse in person than it appears in the photo.
1.0,Was very cute. Popped after a week
1.0,The L shape was too short. These don’t work at all.
1.0,If you buy this product by two size bigger than what you normally would because I washed it and made the mistake of drying it and my child didn’t even get to wear it 1 time 😡
1.0,It's like they were sized for a child.
1.0,Not even worth it
1.0,"I have had this necklace a little over a month and the chain has broke twice now. The first time I was able to use a players to repair and close a loop, but this time it was the small link of the chain and I don’t think it will be repairable by myself. Of course I have missed the return window now and wish I would have returned it the first time it broke."
1.0,2 of the 6 i recieved came in swarovski boxes and were the real deal the other 4 cane in cheap pouches and the bracelets even looked different  shop somewhere else or maybe u will have better luck than me
1.0,"These were beautiful, but the clips hurt my ears. I had to return them for that reason."
1.0,way to small tried to contact seller with absolutly no respoonse.  shirt is still in bag at my office.  shame cause it is a really cute shirt.
1.0,The material is NOT what appears to be...
1.0,Couldn't get it over my 2 year old grandson's head.
1.0,"This product was way to small for me.  I ordered a 4x hoping for it to fit, but it was nothing like the picture.  The sleeves were more like 3/4 sleeves and the length barely went past my waist.  I was not happy with this product at all!"
1.0,Too small. Especially after washing and drying. Poor quality fabric. Feel like I wasted my money.
1.0,These masks feel kind of thin compared to other brands. Some have missing straps and/or nose wires.
1.0,This product is slightly defective. I guess it takes “special gift” to  new level
1.0,Had the belt for 2 months and just started wearing it. The belt fell apart only after me wearing it for 3 weeks.
1.0,Weird fit and scratchy material
1.0,The clasp is very annoying! It never lays flat so it makes the belt look weird.<br />It's a sheer waste of money.
1.0,Super thin pajama like material.
1.0,"Terrible!!! Super short, super small. And I ordered a large! (I'm a size 2-4) I'm 5,6' and it comes mid calf! Ugly as hell! Slit is in the side, not front and the skirt isn't flown but rather fitted straight! So terrible!! Not the dress that is pictured!! Was nothing like the picture!"
1.0,So cheap. Don't even bother they aren't even worth $5. See-through as well
1.0,You can't play your own music with this mask it doesn't have a built in record it totally sucks I'm very disappointed 🤬🤬🤬
1.0,Not dark enough for me.
1.0,"I love the design on these BUT, the material is very cheap feeling and looking. They are extremely thin and see through! I can’t see anyone wearing these anywhere. The color is not fully dyed through the material. When you put them on and they stretch they turn white. All this is, is a print basically stamped on the leggings and that’s why there is no color throughout. Hope this helped in your decision to purchase these."
1.0,I can’t figure out how to attach the strap to the glasses<br />There are no instructions
1.0,i got an xl bc i heard it ran up small- and yes while it did “fit me” the holes were placed at a higher awkward position. the material felt cheap and the rips just looked bad. really disappointed :(
1.0,Will tarnish right away. Worse than Walmart
1.0,"SUPER disappointed in the &#34;full length&#34; robe and the picture of the model, which now I see 166 cm is 5'5&#34;.  Bought it for my daughter who is 5'10&#34; because it's hard to find a &#34;full length&#34; for tall people. So misleading and I'm angry."
1.0,Cute but way too small even tho I order a extra large
1.0,"I ordered this new luggage even though some comments said to watch out for zipper. Great price, owner sent an email thanking me, I thought so good.  The very first time we used it a wheel broke right off. its held on by plastic, we went on a flight and a cruise(which our older luggage has made it through that several times. by the time we got home there was one wheel left. The seller wanted to send me a damaged suit case and a tool kit to take wheels off and put them on our broken set-- I told him I was not going to do that, never heard from him again. Don't buy this luggage, its a huge disappointment and a waste of money, and the service isn't any better.  I usually don't write reviews but I want to make sure that people know what kind of product it is.  pulling a suit case with one wheel through the airport is not fun, and I just bought it the week before."
1.0,I guess I got what I paid for. I would never buy this shoe again.
1.0,Ear holes are not big enough for children's ears. It ends up bending their ears out and down. Does not stay in place as it should.
1.0,Came to me broken
1.0,Holes are to small to put anything through
1.0,Ridiculously small!
1.0,"This dress was cute but fit odd. Too bulky in the bust, but fitted in hips. I’m 5’3” 128lbs for reference."
1.0,"The tunic is made of fabric that feels very strange, like plastic. I ordered one size up and it was very tight. Returning it."
1.0,"Not made for an American woman's shape. Gave it to my very thin 14 yr old niece,very disappointing"
1.0,My son was so excited these colors matched his baseball team. The necklace didn't even make it through the first day. He was so disappointed.
1.0,Not what was expected. Color is more of a rose gold. Kinda cheaply made.
1.0,I received these glasses yes they are packaged very nicely they do look like they are of good quality. They came with a test card to see if they were polarized they are not polarized. The pair I received hardly have any yellow tint to them and do nothing to improve the vision at night.
1.0,If you need large buy xl not sure if that would be enough I bought LG and could not get it on at all they are very small .I went to the local HD dealership and bought instead of trying to get a refund or a replacement
1.0,These shoes run larger than expected.  Not able to wear them.<br />I gave them away.
1.0,The eye holes don't fit well and even bending it doesn't help. its cute until you actually put it on. its made of metal which at least made it sturdy.
1.0,"Ordered large size regular fit, it is more like between a small and a medium leaning more towards a small."
1.0,too small need to return
1.0,I used it for just a couple of days and it’s looking like if I had it for a long time and the quality was not as expected. I don’t recommend this product.
1.0,"The metal part that inserts into the clasp to snap the necklace closed is too large for the opening, and it is a cheap piece of Chinese crap!"
1.0,"These are not as shown in the picture.  Lenses are green, not blue."
1.0,Tarnishes immediately..
1.0,Very small you can see the breast on the side. Feel naked
1.0,"When I received this item, it had a hole at the front of the forehead....😡"
1.0,These were completely see through and ripped less than an hour after wearing them.
1.0,"Bought a 4x, they look like a med/large"
1.0,The silver tarnished in one day
1.0,The rings were small which was bad on my part for not checking the ring sizes. but I wore the ones that did fit and eventually they had left a darkish ring around my finger where the ring had been...not recommended.
1.0,"I very was disappointed in the quality of this coat. The inside lining of the entire right sleeve, underarm to wrists, had not been sewn.  There were many very long stray threads that needed cut. The outside of the coat looked new, but strangely the inside lining looked like used?  The belt that came was 5 inches too long so I had to alter it to fit.  The only reason I kept it was because we had already returned a different coat that didn't fit. I bought it as a gift for a young girl that didn't have a winter coat."
1.0,Very unhappy skirt is bright pink and tshirt has red in it does not match cant send back because she needs to wear top today as her baby sister being born today
1.0,"“Multi-style of Glasses Frame for Women✧ ➤Allowed to choose a perfect eyeglasses frame shape according to the face shape, suitable for Heart, Square, Oval and Round face shape.”<br /><br />If it sounds too good to be true, it is. No multi-style, no choosing. Only one pair. (And not a frame I can wear well.)"
1.0,Petal broke off before I could even finish putting it on 😤
1.0,This shirt runs small. I purchased a 2x and it fit like a large. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I think I just got a defective one. The neckhole was incredibly small, and the lining was rigid and uncomfortable. I've ordered several Allegra K shirts, so I'm sure this was just a fluke. Either way,  I'm super disappointed."
1.0,"Ordered Sailor Moon, but received Supernatural.  I ordered them for my daughter who dressed as Sailor Moon for an anime show. It was too late to exchange them for the correct masks."
1.0,I got an x-large and it was tiny! I gave it to a freeing who wears a small and she said it was tight. I would not recommend.
1.0,This is a Fuad the choker is not like the picture it's small like a dog collar this is a catfish picture it's not the real thing and I bought this twice and it's the same thing very small
1.0,"Back pockets missing. Closure on waistband half missing.  Obviously, quality control at the Chinese manufacturer must be non-existent.  Very disappointing."
1.0,This watch never worked. Wasted my money. Can’t waste my time to return it. Highly disappointed
1.0,Smiley face is off center.
1.0,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EARRINGS THEY ARE NOT WORTH 14.99 THEY ARE WORTH A NICKEL<br />UPDATE: IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT TOO CHEAP TO BE 14.99
1.0,Chinese ripping off IP as usual. Hell they are even using model pics that are not theirs! Shame on you if you buy this knock off!
1.0,I ordered a small and I was swimming in it
1.0,I wear a 34 inch waist shorts/pants.  Have for years.  These were 1.5-2 inches too small.  Correspondence was written in poorly written English.  Made in China.
1.0,"This bag is very small & difficult to get into. If you order it & want to return it, you will have to pay 20% of the purchase price to return. Go to another seller."
1.0,"very dissappointed, very expensive to not be 100% cotton.  Cant return because i cant phisically go to the post office."
1.0,This place does not deserve a star
1.0,They were too small.  I was not happy!
1.0,Way to small ! Not near the size I ordered !
1.0,"Do not waste your time with this blouse. l just do not understand good reviews....l am usually XS and l ordered M (USA). The fabric is very cheap and the front &#34;bow&#34; is just a separate belt/strip which you set around the neck. You can see in the photography that the neck is higher or wider than the &#34;belt&#34; or strip around the neck, (l actually thought it was part of the shirt) however the reality is that the neck height is NOT as pictured and the belt or strip is two times wider so it will NEVER LOOK like in the photography. Lastly, after trying it l took it off and the fabric next to the zipper (back) totally tore, of course.<br /><br />Thankfully it is a $7.00 usd shirt, otherwise l would be so mad about wasting more money."
1.0,Don't buy this p.o.s. you could get the fabric at Michaels and make a better product in twenty minutes.
1.0,"This is a rip off, it’s literally the cheapest made crap, they took a hook and screwed it in the necklace, it won’t hold the Juul like it’s supposed to and even if it did I wouldn’t wear it because if the quality.  Quite honestly this seems more like a scam."
1.0,They came broken.  For $63 I expected better quality.
1.0,Broke​ within 43 days after normal use. The rubber that holds the clip in wore away. It's a very thin piece and not held in well. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this product and do not recommend it.
1.0,"Cute but poorly made, break easily"
1.0,The chain has a good thickness but the clasp is cheaply made and broke within a week. The clasp is not the same quality as the chain.
1.0,Poor quality. The leaf style broke off in a day.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture was cute small
1.0,"I would have loved this dress. I bought a 3x. Per the size chart, a 3x would fit a waist of 43-45 inches. Obviously I’m not the smallest girl, but I ordered according to their chart. The dress that arrived is barely 36 inches in the waist and only if I stretch it a bit. That’s a full 3-4 dress sizes below my own. I waited a month for this dress and now I have to return it and hope I get one in the right size in time for when I planned to wear it in July. If the sizing had been correct I’d probably be giving this 4 stars but now I have the hassle of returning it and trying for 2 sizes up to get a dress that might fit in time."
1.0,"The uppers are not really adjustable, how are they supposed to work? You have a synthetic fabric of a fixed size, and two fake leatheresque flaps on top of that with velcro that can't operate the way they should due to that fabric underneath that's too big and can't really be folded. Epic fail."
1.0,"Basically a tissue tee in tunic length. Don’t buy. The black one wasn’t even a nice rich black. Looked like that brown black. The pink was not the blush pink I expected either. Just don’t. I bought the 2xl because I read to size up for a looser fit, but it was smaller than the xl I bought from another brand."
1.0,Runs very small Xl was like a small size
1.0,"I genuinely don't understand how this got so many good reviews. I looked at the size chart before purchasing. I normally wear a size 20 when it comes to skirts so I ordered a 2XL according to the chart. When this arrived, I tried it on and could only get one leg in it. Is it a 2XL for toddlers?? I returned it the same day."
1.0,This shirt was at least 4 sizes too small. The 4x was like a l/xl so my daughter is wearing it. Also the material is not cotton.
1.0,"cute, but Chinese sizes...xxl is more like a 10-12 in US sizes :(  disappointing"
1.0,"The headband is really tight, and when it gets wet the color transfers"
1.0,"Extremely baggy leggings. Sizing is horrible. It’s almost as if you can’t tell the difference between the front and back of the leggings. Seriously, there’s soooo much fabric that gathers in the crotch region. The waistband does absolutely NOTHING for you; no compression and it doesn’t even stay up on the waist, it just falls right back down. Do yourself a favor and skip these."
1.0,The belt fell apart rather quickly ..
1.0,WAY too small
1.0,Arrived with gem already out. Also aren't as pictured. It shows the black all the way up and around gem when it isnt. It's silver around the gem. Also very hard to unscrew . Not happu
1.0,I received a totally different product than shown in the picture.  Kept it because it would have cost more than the product to send it back.
1.0,"I had a pair of these shorts and loved them. Ordered a second pair but what I received was not the same product. Different tags, smaller pockets, and smaller in size. Horrible and very disappointed."
1.0,"Fabric is see through, and size runs extremely small, will be returning."
1.0,Two out of the three clip broke whilst trying to put them on my hat. The clips are shabby and will not handle any pressure.
1.0,I wore it once and it broke... for real??
1.0,Unclipped way to easy and 1 was lost after 2 days
1.0,Not the size I ordered and not the print shown. They were also coming loose at the seam
1.0,Very then
1.0,"no me gusto la tela es aspera, la talla m es inmensa"
1.0,It's very small size L is XXS
1.0,I have to wear scrub caps to work now because of Covid. I need caps that don’t cover my ears because I take surgical loupes/glasses on and off all day. The picture of the item i thought I would receive is a cap that would go up and over my ears.  The cap I got covers my ears.
1.0,Chain doesn't lock and falls off. Big rip off. Want my money back
1.0,My 2 year olds feet basically drag when he swings. Would not recommend
1.0,"Literally looked like a vagina on me. The way the ruffle is placed is just so odd. Does not fit at all like the model pictured. Just very odd proportions. I selected “fit as expected” because it wasn’t too big or too small, it just fit super strangely."
1.0,Beautiful ring and super comfy. But it’s really cheap metal. After two days of use. Is already starting to turn my finger green on the inside of my hand.
1.0,These shirts took a long time to be delivered and when they arrived they had an awful smell. After airing them out I washed them. They had sticker type tags instead of fabric or imprinted so washing caused the sticker to come off and a sticky gross residue left on the inside collar. It's hard to find plain t shirts in these colors but I will not buy again and would not have purchased had I known these issues.
1.0,I ordered these for halloween but didn't try them on and now it's too late to return.<br />they are about two sizes too small.
1.0,I did not keep this. Very disappointed. Looks cheap and flimsy.
1.0,Nose screws came apart loose
1.0,NOT squat proof- almost completely see through on my butt before I even bend all the way over. I ordered a size up from what I normally wear and it was still too revealing.
1.0,"The XL top was too long, I am 5'7 and it came down almost to my knees. More of a dress than a tunic top. I returned the top and was charged shipping even though it is listed as free returns."
1.0,Product fell apart after 1 day of use.
1.0,"Reasons to not purchase this:<br />- they don't collapse for easier and more convenient storage,<br />- they're very stiff and not adjustable<br />- they're HUGE<br />- they aren't very soft"
1.0,Says adjustable size but to small for my very average size man hands.. bummed!
1.0,I have tried ordering three of these straps and am getting ready to return the third one in a row.  The  problem is that the top buckle on the strap to tighten it on the suitcase is on the reverse side of the strap which will cause damage to the suitcase.  The only fix for this is to go to a seamstress and have them fix it for you which will cost you at least 8 dollars.  The concept is great but someone at the factory isn't paying attention to qulity control.  If you look at the attached photo you will see there is no way to flip the buckle around properly.
1.0,Needs real sizes
1.0,There is no texture to this top other than the tassels at the bottom. It’s just a thin piece of patterned cloth. Not at all as I expected.
1.0,"The only thing o like about these is , true to color.<br />Sizing is way off."
1.0,So disappointed. This is a skirt not a dress. Unfortunately this is the 2nd time a company has listed a skirt as a dress and fooled me. It's not cute in person. It looks like it was an irregular which should've been tossed out.
1.0,Both pockets tore. Not very well made. I really like the overall look of the shirts.
1.0,Seemed more like a girl's jean than boy's
1.0,If I could give 0stars I would.  You shouldn’t be selling the murch  of this deleted channel against their wishes
1.0,To small and would like a bigger size
1.0,"Would not buy again. The zipper on this 35L black Seehonor backpack refused to open on first use at the beach, and couldn't get to our towels. The zipper quality is poor. Maybe it was the heat of the sun on a black backpack (black got hot in the sun, including hot on my back while wearing it), but this didn't happen in 3 years in hiking/beaches of Europe, Carribean & USA with another brand (Hikpro) packable 20L blue backpack. The zipper opened reluctantly later at night when it cooled down, but it snags easily.<br /><br />Folding it into while inverting the bag into it's side pocket is overly complicated. It doesn't come with instructions. It does not easily pack flat, and is often lumpy for travel. In contrast my other 20L is much easier to pack small in it's attached pocket which becomes the inner small item zippered pocket. My other packable backpacks fold into the middle of the vertical axis of the pack - symmetry is easier when there not folding instructions. Folding this 35L Seehonor bag is an exercise in frustration!<br /><br />Finally, the Seehonor bag's front vertical zipper opens into the single main compartment. That's sad, as my other brand 20L bag is much more practical and comfortable with medium sized front compartment, the large main compartment and a zippered inside small top pocket (which is also what it folds/packs into for travel.<br /><br />A disappointed customer."
1.0,it broke after a day so yes i hate this
1.0,"Great product, does not ride up, cups perfectly (if maybe a bit snug)<br /><br />Purchased a set of trunk in May 2019, as of today (Sept 2019), two pairs of trunks now have small holes in them. Appears that the quality is not meant to last long. I just expected more from this purchase."
1.0,"This was a massive disappointment. Only one side of the wig held up, the other side flopped down with no way to keep the hair up. The quality was very poor. I requested a return immediately, which was granted."
1.0,This was very thin.  Didn't seem like the Russell of yesteryear..  The pocket came undone upon opening the package.  Poor quality control.
1.0,"Red hair balls are often dropped, everywhere"
1.0,"I’ve been wearing crawlers for years so I’m very familiar with how to put them on & take them off VERY carefully and delicately, also I’m always looking for new, unique, and pretty pairs of crawlers so I was SO excited when I found these and of course ordered ASAP! They were even nicer than I thought they’d be in person (it’s hit or miss when ordering jewelry online) and the second time I put them on to wear the post snapped right off!!! I was SO disappointed since I was planning to wear to wedding! I’m SO careful and experienced in putting them on so I was even more upset since it snapped without any undo pressure on the earring and post itself!<br />I would’ve given 5 stars ⭐️ Otherwise!!!<br />Sad!<br />And now a waste of money since I only got to wear once!"
1.0,"They fit very small and when I tried to return, it cost so much to return that it wasn’t worth it."
1.0,"Too small, different fit then whats projected"
1.0,Very disappointed!  L is no where close to a 12-14.  Most of my bottoms are 10s so the fact that I couldn't get this on says a lot.
1.0,"The hat itself is very comfortable but I am disappointed because the hat that was delivered was not in anyway the hat I had ordered. Considering this was supposed to be a surprise for my boyfriend to replace his favourite hat that I lost years ago, I am disappointed."
1.0,broken...
1.0,"Hopefully, my boyfriend can iron out all the wrinkles. I wanted to return the item but he was so grateful and stated he did not want to return the item he would just make a strong attempt to put water in the iron, use starch, and steam to get the wrinkles out."
1.0,I've bought cheap readers before that are so much better. The frames are junk and the nose pieces very uncomfortable and too thick. Can't be adjusted sufficiently.
1.0,The socks are such a thin material on the toe. Similar to a heavy opaque tights. Easily torn if you wear ankle boots or snow boots.
1.0,"Their product offering is wrong, found out the hard way. My package arrived with black and gray, dark blue and red. I was suppose to get Teal and Orange, not dark blue and red. Emailed them and was told lack of supply. Funny, the offering says nothing about a lack of supply and what you'll get instead. Bad business for a product I was excited about."
1.0,"The color of the shirt looks black in the picture but it actually arrives as a dark charcoal grey. Aslo, it runs very very small. I ordered a 14/16 and this looks like a size 8. I am returning it."
1.0,"Dreadful synthetic material, very cheap looking. On top of everything, totally see-through. Sits really weird around the neck."
1.0,Good: It is light.<br /><br />Not good: Its rounded edges does not make for good stacking-stowing when travelling. Also the belly of the case is semi-curved which made for slipping of other suitcases when stacked on the airport trolly for transport.<br /><br />Good: This taught me to buy only non-rounded luggage in this square travel-culture we live in.
1.0,"One side (side with band going into the plastic)  went onto the watch just like any other band no problems, but the other side (side with plastic loop) does not latch in place to the watch it will just slide all the way through. Might be just one bad band out of lots of other good reviews but not worth taking a chance on  expensive apple watch falling off on bike ride in the woods or gone forever when kayaking so got refund not a replacement. ***Update**** Pictures"
1.0,This is junk and could not do anything or open a watch cover
1.0,This dress feels just like a tank top.. It's even thicker around the neck and arms. I'm 5'3 110lbs a small is big on me.
1.0,I really wanted to like these but the mediums fit like a large or XL and there are no smaller options.
1.0,These looked really good online but when I received them I found them to look and feel cheap and flimsy. I tried to return them but ran out of time on the return window. Now I'm stuck with something I really don't like. Amazon needs a competitor.
1.0,Well made<br />quality work<br />great price
1.0,"Se cayó la foto, ya no sirve la pulsera la tire 😖, ojalá puedan hacerla más resistente."
1.0,I liked the design.  The loop on the charm broke off in one day.
1.0,What I thought I ordered were &#34;long&#34; (like it states in the description) leg warmers. What I got were short boot cuffs. Way off! Not happy with this one!
1.0,I returned it and it looked like a walmart cheap shirt and someone took plain sissors to make cuts. I recommend<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095P7G5N8?pf_rd_r=Z0PW9HWA7HSAMQVKD4AX&pf_rd_p=8fe9b1d0-f378-4356-8bb8-cada7525eadd&pd_rd_r=f44434be-3d3f-47fc-a60c-f791606d8f1f&pd_rd_w=cbO2q&pd_rd_wg=nqGkN&ref_=pd_gw_unk
1.0,Necklace arrived damaged
1.0,Buyer beware once this top is washed even with cold water hand washing it shrinks it at least 2 sizes.  I have other tunics by this brand and they have been fine.  Sorry to have to write this.
1.0,The two long screw drivers dont even fir inside.
1.0,Doesn’t fit the Polaris Backup Valve. This collar inner diameter is too small and will not allow the top of the Polaris backup valve to pass through. I subsequently purchased a Polaris brand replacement collar which fit.
1.0,I absolutely hate this dress. The material & style didn’t meet my expectations. Cheap quality.
1.0,The band is just to stiff and uncomfortable. It also lacks the quick release that comes on the stock band.
1.0,Arrived defected... there were parts where the weave were tearing apart
1.0,"Should be sold as boys not men's underwear, yes that small."
1.0,"I usually wear a large.  Based on other user reviews, I ordered an XXL because it came from China.  Oh my!  I barely could get my arms through the sleeves. And if you have a bra size larger than an A cup, forget about it.  This is definitely made for tiny framed females.  Too bad because I think it's so pretty!"
1.0,Too  small waste off money
1.0,This item is cheap.
1.0,Its not leather so am returning it
1.0,Broke right out of the package
1.0,"I really wanted to like this — it’s cute but the bottom part is too loose and the blouse ends up looking square. Sleeves are also big and voluminous. I was looking for a more fitted, polished look. Made me look like I was a few pounds heavier."
1.0,Necesito un reembolso por la compra de estos productos muy malos. Ese vendedor esta estafando a la gente. No puede ser que ese producto sea tan mala calidad. Eso daña la imagen de Amazon
1.0,The one I got was unwearable. The crotch Sean was sewn to live up with the dart under the left boob instead of centered.
1.0,Fell apart first time I put it on
1.0,Saw this on tiktok and had to try it out but it's honestly just easier to use your hands.
1.0,Love these shoes! My son has received so many compliments. This brand has never failed us!<br /><br />***update*** my son has been wearing these for less than 3 months and the lining has holes worn through it on both feet. These are way too costly to only last a couple of months! I've bought this brand many times before and never had this problem.
1.0,Nice quality but the elastic in the waistband started rolling almost immediately and got worse after every washing.  Cute but would not recommend.
1.0,The fit was not good at all. I bought an appropriate size for my body type. Even if I sized up I don't think that would have made a difference. The lapels were non existent once I tried it on. Returned it immediately.
1.0,"I'm sorry, I guess I don't understand the great reviews.. mine was worth every penny... 28cents!<br /> and the chain is not even worth that."
1.0,"Not at all what I had hoped. Material is stiff, outside is rough/snaggy. Too narrow for what I wanted."
1.0,Very hard to adjust its backwards
1.0,This was to replace what I thought was the same mesh bad I used for the prior year and LOVED. THIS IS LOWER QUALITY BY FAR! the mesh is not finished on edges which causes it to catch on everything from my shirt sleeve to hair constantly. I have fairly small hands and average size wrist and this was difficult to slip on. I don't see a man getting it on without fully taking apart which difeats it's purpose. This was returned within a couple days of frustrated use.
1.0,Very cheap looking and not rose gold as described. I returned this product because I wasn’t happy with it!
1.0,The stitching was so bad the bow feel off the 1st day.
1.0,I unfortunately had to return this beautiful dress because it didn't fit and a larger size would not have worked either. The material has no stretch which is something I need for my body type. My measurements are 34DD-24-42 so there is no way a dress like this will fit because my body is small I just like many women have breasts and a booty if I went a size up my body would have been floating in it.
1.0,"I thought these were adorable, and maybe it’s my fault for not looking closer at product images, but these bib overalls have VERY sharp metal edges that are dangerous for my teething 6mo daughter. Thankfully I figured this out before she wore them, but I don’t recommend these— not safe! Especially when your baby puts everything in her mouth."
1.0,Sewn un even.... waste of money... it looks crooked... I will save your money ladies... it fits if you go up 2 sizes... but seriously poor quality and you don't know who is going to sew it I guess because mine was majorly crooked
1.0,So thin they do not protect
1.0,I didn't like the printing on back it was a rubbery feeling
1.0,The shirt is at least a size smaller while the pants are about 2 sizes larger than ordered.
1.0,The picture is deceiving. The headband width is half the size depicted in this picture.
1.0,The pictures really don't show how glittery this is. I personally don't care but kids are mean and my son was too embarrassed to wear this.
1.0,Shipping was fast but it broke almost immediately
1.0,Gave to charity
1.0,Item is very cute but it arrived damaged. It has a hole in it. I’m so disappointed because I would’ve worn it!
1.0,"Although a good design, they're low quality. I tried them on and they broke. The glue isn't strong enough to hold the beads."
1.0,The clasp broke off the earring in 4 days.
1.0,Cheap you pay for what u get for.. Didn't even stay on my teeth would fall off for anything
1.0,there is no adjustment at the ears to hold the mast up on face
1.0,Not to happy it wasn”t the size i expect it to be not even fitts my wrist its mostly  for a little girl and the delivery time worst to many to many dates changing
1.0,"The inside of the waist band keeps flipping out the wrong way and rolling up on my stomach, which is irritating as well as not flattering at all.  If it wasn't for that, these pants would be decent workout pants.  I would not recommend buying these pants."
1.0,"Got size 3-6 months, looks like it's meant for a two year old. Not happy."
1.0,Sent this item back very poor quality really thin and clingy
1.0,Horrible product. Do not buy. The sizes are all ther exact same.
1.0,Not a 14g as stated.
1.0,Way smaller than it looks
1.0,The clasp broke before I could wear it
1.0,Broken straps
1.0,Child's shoe not adult
1.0,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews about the fit. You would need to order 2 to 3 sizes above your normal size. Even with the size chart, it just does not fit, not even close. The material also has zero give or stretch, I don't think ordering this skirt is worth it. Who wants a clothing item in their wardrobe that is 3 sizes over their actual size? I particularly don't. I like ordering my size and it fitting me, just like my other garments of that same size. This seller should absolutely remarket this skirt towards actual little girls, not really a Womens clothing item. It's cute but I wouldn't buy it again or suggest a friend buy it and am actually returning it."
1.0,"Very cheap materials...fabric ripped the first time I put an item into it.<br /><br />Bought this back in January for my trip to hawaii where I’ll be doing lots of hiking. I started packing my stuff this evening, the night before we leave, and the seam to the main compartment rips! On top of that...the promised rainproof cover was not included!<br /><br />I’ll take responsibility for not checking the full package when I received the bag back at the end of January, but the fabric ripping when I packed my first item into the backpack is utterly unacceptable"
1.0,I got a small and it was huge on me !! Fit like a large.
1.0,"EXTREMELY FLIMSY, NO STRUCTURE WHATSOEVER<br />It is not square like the picture and collapses like a t-shirt when on the ground.<br />Buckles fly open as the magnets are not strong. I super glued the magnets together so I could use the buckles, but now it takes 8 minutes to get into my bag<br />FORGET ABOUT A LAPTOP, it will flop around the bag and hit the floor every time you put your bag down<br /><br />This bag sucks. If you want it, then save $50 and go and just get a laundry bag at wal-mart. I'm serious"
1.0,Got an XL per Amazon recommendation and it was HUGE. Exhanged for a medium and it still did not fit well. Too big in some places too small in others.. Not even attractive on the hanger. Material hot and itchy. Sorry for the harsh review just being honest
1.0,"The color was faded, something that's supposed to be new."
1.0,"I bought this $79 dress as a bridesmaid for a wedding cause the bride loved the pictures of it. When it came, it looked nothing like the pictures. Not the same style or color! I immediately took it off and started the refund process. Back in its original packaging. These people make you pay for the return with was $17 at the post office and then charged a $59.99 refund processing fee. To only refund me $27 NEVER AGAIN. The number they have provided doesn’t work. It’s a SCAM."
1.0,"May be ok for a younger girl to wear, but it is very cheap looking and feeling"
1.0,Was given a women's size.......
1.0,Sleeves extra long
1.0,I f do is like the fit and the quality of the material.
1.0,"They might have been ok for cheap slippers but one was bigger than the other.  I sent them back as requested but never did get a response from the company, however, Amazon has lived up to it's reputation and gave me a gift card for the full amount.  Thank you Amazon."
1.0,Lace was unevenly stitched. Not as good material as I thought it would be.
1.0,"Compré el producto en septiembre y ya no tiene el color rosa original, ahora es color oro"
1.0,Hmmm honestly pretty confusing item.<br />1. Why is it titled “nail free” when they are clearly with nails that you have to push through your pants? (Holes as shown in the picture)<br />2. The button that connects the nail is about 7mm wide which makes the waist area far from flat/comfortable and will rub your skin (not sharp though).<br /><br />I see the creativity in it but I simply won’t recommend the production those looking to tighten their jeans/pants while keeping it comfortable.
1.0,"not sure why my 1st review wasn't posted, the explanation i was given didn't make sense at all, so here's my 2nd attempt:<br />The ring i received was a mess. I'm insulted that it was sent to me. It had some kind of sticky substance on it, was missing THREE of the stones, was scratched..it seriously looked like it was worn for a long period of time by someone who works really really hard..I'm baffled as to how something in such bad condition could be sent to me. Or anyone. And then in order to get my money back I had to return this thing that should never have been sent in the first place."
1.0,Looks nothing like the pic. Very cheap material
1.0,These glasses are ugly. If you are influencer and they reach out to you. BEWARE. They use you.
1.0,I purchased these jeans thinking they were going to be the same as the ones I once was able to purchase at K-Mart as I have a curvy figure  but I was wrong.<br />These just don't have the stretch that I was anticipating and the fit is horrible.<br />After this purchase I am going back to the rule of only buying pants that I can try on first.
1.0,"Don't buy if you want to actually use it to decode. This ring is incorrect from how pigpen is deciphered. I don't remember exactly but I think it H,I,J,K was switched with T,U,V,W or something like that"
1.0,It was nothing like the photo! I could not fit it! I am upset!! I won’t return because it will cost me more to return than what I paid for it. I’m extremely upset
1.0,I ordered XXL (I normally wear 36 to 38 waist) and these are WAY too small in the thighs and around the waist. I can't even get them on all the way.
1.0,I never received my product and was really looking forward to this colorful blouse!
1.0,"Sent as a gift to my girlfriend. She put it on her visor and came out after work, item was broken in five pieces on her seat. Cheap and poorly made."
1.0,Piece of junk. Paper thin
1.0,The zipper broke too easily
1.0,Way too large and was way late
1.0,"Ordered 25mm (1"") got half"" way to small"
1.0,"I ordered a large because all my T-shirts in my closet are Large and fit fine. This one is labeled a large, but measures more like a child's large than an adult large. When I measure my own T-shirts, spread out flat on a table, they measure about 21&#34;-22&#34; across under the sleeves. This one measures only 19&#34;! That is a full 4&#34;-6&#34; in circumference too small. They should clearly state that this product runs EXTREMELY SMALL from how it is labeled."
1.0,These are really cute but they're so cheap they fell apart when I was trying to add them to my shoes.  I returned them.
1.0,Within 2 months only wearing twice zipper fell off and now I can't wear the jersey!
1.0,Bad design. The wood doesn’t look good at all. One cuff link is darker than the other. Seems like the wood is dry in one and wet in the other. Definitely doesn’t look like advertised. Just ugly!
1.0,this is the tiniest crystal ive ever seen. i was not expecting it to be this small. the picture made it seem like it was big. i am very disappointed!!
1.0,"Doesn't secure you. You bounce all over the place. Fits but not a secure, tight, sports fit."
1.0,"These socks are very warm, but they do not stay up, my son says they slip all the way down to his feet, very annoying in his work boots, having to pull the up all the time."
1.0,Ordered larger size on purpose still was way too small and even too short. Being returned
1.0,Just got a new pair of aviators and REALLY wanted to put sunglass lenses on them.  The  product came without directions and try as I may I could not get the product to fit onto my glasses.  Yet another product tossed into the trash…
1.0,"Wow very disappointed :(<br />I was really excited to get this 3 piece. I got a size medium, and size looks like it’s XS!!!"
1.0,Very unhappy both pair of pants  are way too small and I got a large I order pants before I didn’t know a Large will look like an eight year old can fit these pants unbelievable now I have to order another pair and the only reason why I’m doing is because they’re so cute
1.0,picture is deceiving...do not buy
1.0,"Zipper was sewn on very bad, it unstitched with the first tug. (Zipper didn't break, just unstiched) front string / ribbion  is of very low quality.. would recommend this for any one with small waist and big hips. Awkward fit."
1.0,It arrived broken. Not even removed from the package. Very cheaply made. Not worth the $8.99 I spent.
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter and as you can see, it is peeling.  I am suprised as it is a pokemon brand item and I would think it would hold up. This was worn properly and not damaged by the owner in any way. Do not buy this product."
1.0,Defective fastener on watch band impossible to wear. Thanks for not checking product prior to shipping.
1.0,Jacket fit extremely small. Was suppose to be a plus size 2x couldn’t even fit one arm in it.
1.0,"This is the second time writing a review on this as my first was removed for some reason. Color quality is terrible, isn’t no where near as vibrant as the photo. Sweater material and sleeve cuff is also completely different. I’m returning as this isn’t what I was expecting."
1.0,"Fabrics on each are inconsistent.  A few were fine and, after washed, soft enough.  Others felt like the cheapest, roughest, ickiest feeling thing that is not actually identifiable as any legitimate &#34;cloth,&#34; much less cotton.  Additionally, after washing, over half of them were completely shredded because the stitching is so faulty that you're basically dealing with raw edges.  NOPE."
1.0,Cute..... but has a hole in it after one wear....
1.0,I did not like the shirt!
1.0,2 holes<br />Its very soft though!
1.0,"Very odd fitting, very disappointed with this product"
1.0,NOT WORKING
1.0,Way too big. The picture does not show how huge they look in your ear - it just wasn't cute.
1.0,"This is the farthest thing from a Joey Jordison mask. Wrong color, cheap looking. Very disappointed. I mean for what I paid I wasn't expecting anything too authentic but come on, at least get the color right."
1.0,"Ripped after wearing 3 times. Cool design, bad fabric."
1.0,Terrible! Willie looks like he has black teeth. Horrible screen print.  Want my money back. This was a gift for my brother. So incredibly bummed
1.0,"The worst thing I purchased in Amazon, dont waste ur money."
1.0,You will have to order 2 sizes up and the return cost you
1.0,So uncomfortable. Cheap plastic. Hurts my nose. Sticks out and doesn't fit face
1.0,Very unstable
1.0,Bought the Navy blue dress. Wore once and hand washed the next day. There are white rubber pieces splitting out of the lace in the arms everywhere! One use. That's all I got. Outside of return window by the time I wore it--it's not like I can wear it this way... (see picture) faded from flash...
1.0,waay too small
1.0,"I was super excited for these as I pretty much live in workout clothes these days.  I really loved the pattern on these.<br /><br />These are pretty stretchy, but they are completely see though.  They even sheered out to more of  a gray once they stretch when you put them on.  They are cute, but sadly I will never wear these."
1.0,Complete junk. Broke first day I wore them. Extremely flimsy. Don't buy these!
1.0,Bought a large but it fits more like a medium. Was damp and had a musty smell. I washed hoping to make it softer and smell better and get it to stop shedding. Washing it kind of helped the smell.
1.0,the wristband does not fit the Xiaomi Mi Band 2!!
1.0,"Cheaply made products, not a goodbye for the money."
1.0,One of them was distorted!
1.0,"This definitely runs small, even though I read the sizing chart, it does not fit."
1.0,I ordered these to be large on me. Evidently they are sized you be large on an Asian person
1.0,This would've been great if it didn't come out of the packaging bent and completely out of shape.
1.0,"You would have to be a size 14 or so to wear the 6XL... wow... I wear Old Navy size 18 jeans, at the widest part of my waist (so not on my hips), and I was still about EIGHT inches short when trying on the 6XL. Yikes."
1.0,"I purchased a 2XL, and the bag says 2XL but the shirt says XL-USA, 2XL-EU<br />I purchased from US so it should not have been sold as a 2XL"
1.0,Disintegrated after swimming in the pool. What a piece of crap!
1.0,returned.  Obviously mis-sized.
1.0,"I purchased this for my daughter and it is made so small, I ordered a xl and it looks like a small. I’m sending it back."
1.0,Inner lining of bra cups not sewn into bra???
1.0,wow thanks for telling me that this bag will fit a sammich and maybe a book
1.0,"Very thin material and see-through fabric. I did not like this dress, i was able to see my undergarments line through the dress. It is not properly lined on the inside. It is not worth the cost."
1.0,Did not fit well. Had to return it.
1.0,"See through, too large in waist and way too small in chest"
1.0,I bought one size up even though it says true to size didn’t even go to my thighs... the material is stretch but the stitching is not so it doesn’t actually stretch. Good luck!
1.0,Haven't had it a month and the silver coating is coming off
1.0,They broke as soon as my son folded them together!
1.0,Rough. Don’t bother
1.0,This product is really poorly made - also if you stood within 10’ of a fire high chances of catching alight as it feels very flammable
1.0,Arrived scratched and the frame is chipped. Not happy and definitely sending back.
1.0,Climbers kept falling down wouldn't hold in place.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in this, I expected a sweater, and this was thin poorly made cotton something or another"
1.0,Did not light up returned it
1.0,The picture is deceiving. Do not purchase
1.0,"La tela es muy bueno, pero son más pequeños que las tallas normal"
1.0,Horrible! It’s not even made right  it opens up to EXPOSE BRA! So not buy this junk
1.0,Material is cheap.. shorts are frumpy
1.0,Poor quality hardly looks like the picture very disappointed
1.0,This faded so fast and got pills all over after one wash. It looks more like pajamas than a dress.
1.0,Extremely too long
1.0,This is not as advertised.  Do not buy it.  I received it today and returning it tomorrow.
1.0,Is a NOT like the picture! Much longer and fits extremely SMALL.
1.0,"dont pay for this, go and buy a nike or adidas sports bra."
1.0,The charm is cute but I tried it on and the charm fell off. Waste of money.
1.0,This bracelet broke after the second day I wore it! I will not be buying anything from this seller again!!!
1.0,It was very unflattering. I ordered it in my size and it didn’t fit at all. Very cheap feeling! Feels and looks like something off of wish! DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Not very nice material
1.0,Not at all what I expected. I am a B-cup and the padded bra portion of the top was a bit loose and ill fitting.<br />To keep it in place I needed to make the tie very tight.<br />I
1.0,this item was returned
1.0,"Runs big, I purchased a medium and it was too big.  I’m typically a 9 in pants and medium shirt."
1.0,"Definitely not for older people. If you have arthritis in your hands you will never get them on. My husband can't do it himself and for me to do it was impossible. Instructions, what a joke. I have broken every nail, have hurt my hands so bad I just sat and cried. Never again."
1.0,"Wasn't able to wear them, entirely too small."
1.0,Too small for being a man's watch.
1.0,Cheap and was misshapen when I received it in the mail.
1.0,The material on this shirt is so super thin even the black is see-thru and has loose threads. It does fit true to size but will be going back.
1.0,I ordered my size and it is about two sizes too small. Order up a size or two.
1.0,Style no as expected.... thought it was loose fitting but was more narrow and straight
1.0,Sucks! DO NOT ORDER...IT IS NOT STERLING SILVER! IT'S BARBIE DOLL JEWELRY
1.0,Its Rubbish
1.0,The hat looks like it was under the rocks.  Completely flat
1.0,The top was to tight and the vest to..I wore it to my Granddaughter wedding but I was so uncomfortable all the time I was there....but it looked  nice but I'll never wear it again..It cost me over $125.00 for that one night outing....I wish I had. Bought it somewhere else so if it didn't fit I  could return it with no problem...I've had  nothing but probleming with this....well I learned  my lesson..<br />I AM DISABLE AND I CAN'T GET OUT TO GO SHOPPING SO I DO ALL MY SHOPPING  ON INTERNET....I JUST WISH I HAD BETTER LUCK SHOPPING THE INTERNET...I'M SO DISAPPOINTED 😞 😔 😪 😕 😢 💔
1.0,Came in very poor condition
1.0,"The ""new"" turtleneck we ordered was very obviously used.  Not just used but well washed.  The laundry instruction tag sewn on the inside bottom was faded and crinkled, the way it is for shirts you've washed at least a dozen times.  There were no paper tags attached to the shirt.  It was unquestionably a used shirt they sold as ""new.""<br /><br />This was a good reminder of why I hate Amazon.  I try my best to avoid them as much as possible for precisely this reason.  The goods you receive are very often NOT as advertised."
1.0,"Material very thin, I ordered XL which is my size, but what I received was more like a xsmall"
1.0,"Way to small!!!  They may be Junior, but did not say that's there that I could see when I ordered them.  Thru were so small I couldn't even get them over my hips and therefor did not match the size on their size chart at all."
1.0,This is a cheap Chinese knock-off. I should have known that the price was too good.
1.0,Not true to size and colors misleading
1.0,Got it the middle of March and it broke 2 weeks ago.  Not very happy.  Which it was more durable.
1.0,"Poor quality.  Backs did not fit on the earring posts,  AND there was a variation in color between the 2 earrings.  Thankfully Amazon issued a refund. Buyer beware."
1.0,These were cheap and ugly
1.0,Washed once faded.....
1.0,"I purchased the hot /bright pink,  but got a soft baby pink.  It fits so small I cant wear anything under it.  I went a size up,  but should have went up two sizes.  Very disappointed in the color being off. Also it's called bomber jacket coat,  more appropriately its just a sweatshirt."
1.0,Gaps between watch and bend are really big.
1.0,Item is not thick but ok for Texas weather.
1.0,I completely understand that these are inexpensive so I can’t expect much but honestly were so pathetic I was too embarrassed to put them on a kids’ birthday party favor. Returned them.
1.0,Order a 6-7 and when it arrived it looked like a size 3t——update: i have this to my friends daughter since it didn’t fit mine and it fit her perfectly. Her daughter is 2 years old. If that helps lol
1.0,No way to connect ends to the Fitbit. Completely worthless!  Only option for replacement was to return it—not worth it for $6. Will avoid this company in the future!
1.0,I like the design but didn't last longer. It turned black in no time. I am not sure if this is Sterling Silver as described. I have other jewelery in Sterling Silver and have never seen them changing color in all these years.
1.0,This bag shrunk to an absolutely useless pathetically fraction of it's original size. UGH! RETURNED
1.0,"Do not go by the images for size. The bag those women are ""holding"" is photoshopped on. I should have paid more attention to dimensions. Pics are false advertising. Bag is tiny!"
1.0,"I really wish I read the reviews before purchasing.  It really is like a little girls top. My 7 year old tried it on and it was a belly shirt on her. If you want want a shirt that literally just covers your boobs, then this is the shirt for you....otherwise don't waste your money"
1.0,I ordered this specifically for the chain it came with and it didn't come with a chain. This listing is misleading do not buy.
1.0,The cut and the way that these shorts are designed are not suitable for XL people with thick thighs. It looks good only if you stay still. Walking in them is weird because of the shape of the shorts.
1.0,Terrible. The texture and quality are terrible
1.0,The dress was torn in the back. It looks like they left a space to sew a zipper but the dress was torn further down from there. Very disappointed
1.0,Wanted something that I could keep in my ear that wouldn’t fall out. Been wearing it for about 2 months now not even a full two months (ordered it as Christmas present) hasn’t irritated my ears comfortable but the black paint has already chipped off. Really disappointed ☹️
1.0,3x fits like a large ! to top it off you pay for the return!! never again!
1.0,Bought this for my granddaughter for a school event it ripped about an hour into her event
1.0,"I dont know of they were just mine but they were waaaaayyyy too small they were teeny tiny theyre perfect enough for my nephew whos 1and for some reason theyre hard to close, it feels stiff to close. Pretty disappointed because theyre nice glasses just too small"
1.0,I didn't like it it doesn't look like the way it looked it before I bought
1.0,Fabric is  extremely see-through.  Seams incorrectly gathered in some areas and not in others. Neckline is a mess.  Poor sewing.  Would give zero if possible.<br />Returning.
1.0,Nothing like the pic.bad fitting and quality
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is in second grade and started school on August 7, 2019. The first time she used the lunch bag the Velcro strip came off, and not even after a month of use one of the side pockets ripped at the bottom and one of the straps broke. Not very happy about this purchase."
1.0,It was beautiful but a piece of crap I wore it for less than three days and it broken three pieces obviously by the price point is not worth spending money to repair I don't recommend this product at all
1.0,Do not buy!! This product did not work and seller wanted to charge me shipping to even return it or only a 50% refund. Waste of money
1.0,The pants feel like they could be worth the money but any slight change to the front button and it will instantly tear off with very little force. So try other FR pants that can last because these won't.
1.0,they where bad!!!!!!! it doesn't matter about the price they were horrible infected my ears and turned them green bad
1.0,I got a dog tag not a necklace like the picture clearly shows. A shame it was a gift otherwise I would've returned it.
1.0,They were broken when they got to me.
1.0,Material is cheap feeling.
1.0,Horrible bra. Can’t even wear around the house.
1.0,Honestly it is one of the thinnest chains I’ve ever seen. When I put it on you could not even see it against my skin. If you are looking for a neckless that is almost non existent this one is for you. I returned it.
1.0,"This popped up in a search for &#34;queen thigh high stocking&#34;. They are not queen. They are &#34;one size fits short and skinny&#34;. (I don't have a problem with short and skinny, but it's not what I was shopping for).<br /><br />The tops are uncomfortable as others mentioned, and they have a huge, constricting seam in the top. They are also SERIOUSLY flimsy; immediate HUGE runs/laddering that became a giant hole all the way around the leg.<br /><br />If I can find purple by another manufacturer, go there."
1.0,The pants where way to small for the size they should be.  The material is not good.
1.0,Very disappointed in this sweater. I wanted to like it. Very very thin. See through in fact.  It was snug but it just had no shape to it.  I love sweaters. I buy tons of them but could not find anything to like about this one so I donated it since it was past the return date bc I was out of state when it came in. So sad.
1.0,"Yikes, I couldn’t even pull these up past my knee! Sizing is way off, at least for the best here’s purple ones."
1.0,Sizing is WAY off
1.0,I ordered the 6mm(2g) and they would not go in my ears at all. I ended up measuring the ends to find out they're 8mm. No wonder they wouldnt fit. How am I supposed to put something in my ears that are 2mm bigger than my size?
1.0,"The dress wasn't too bright red as depicted. It was more of a burgundy. The fit was super tight. I had purchased dress to use as a costume, so never even tried it on until costuming for the play began. Then noticed that there was a rip in the seam. I could not get my money back."
1.0,"Very disappointed in this product. Beautiful, but the posts would not go into the backings, posts too long and posts easily bent.  Would not EVER recommend this product."
1.0,You didn’t provide a Certificate for the freshwater pearls authenticating it. Please provide in my email ASAP since this is a gift!!
1.0,They're cheaply made and break very easily.
1.0,"Some letters were missing ink, such as half of the letter was black and the other half was just silver. There were random black dots around the writing. I tried to scratch it off, but it wouldn’t come off. It was black extra ink that seemed to be splattered on randomly that wouldn’t come off. I didn’t give it as a gift because it didn’t look beautiful. I’m disappointed with the purchase."
1.0,Broke day one.
1.0,This bracelet is way smaller in person than what I thought the picture showed. It is absolutely tiny!
1.0,"This was not as it was pictured, don't bother with buying it."
1.0,Not at all what the picture shows. For me it looks just like a huge t shirt strangely cut at the bottom. Disappointed!
1.0,The plástic shield is awful. It came too folded  and makes  dificulty  to see through.  Cheap plástic<br />Received one order but didnot received the 2 in one other Order i madeb the sane day
1.0,"Fit is terrible, the legs are fine but it's too loose at the waist (yes I know it's a stretch-waist, but even this is too much). The button came right off within 30 minutes of wearing which definitely made it an awkward work day for me. I would not recommend."
1.0,"I liked the concept of it but the straps were way to short. Wouldn't tie for me. I had ordered 2 and luckily it was skinny teens that were using them, which they barely were able to tie. Also the fabric to wipe your hands on sucked. It needed to be towel material and not super soft. It wasn't absorbent at all."
1.0,"I recently discovered this new style of underwear that I love.  It is comfortable and it is soft and cotton.  I really like it. I have it from two different companies and both run the same in sizing.  I saw these and saw they were the same so I ordered them according to the size chart- BIGGER than I normally do.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric of these is very thin.  It is stretchy but not over the top.  The bands are so soft that they almost feel like they are not entirely cotton which is a NO for me.<br /><br />SIZING<br />My GOD this is unreal.  I have posted a picture for you of the same style I have in these underwear from another company in a LARGE.  They fit fine and are fantastic underwear.  On the other side of the photo are these in a size X-LARGE.  They are TINY in comparison!  Keep in mind these are supposed to be LARGER than the others.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These are way off in sizing.  They are not at all like the others of this type that I have gotten and the fabric is very thin too.  These really were not at all what they should have been.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  These are more like an X-LARGE for young girls, not Misses sizes.  The quality was not great either."
1.0,like buying a used rubber band :-(
1.0,Complete junk hat. I actually threw it away.
1.0,Made for very very small and petite women received an XL no stretch as advertised. Poorly made. Don't waste your money false advertisement!
1.0,"Sent back, dosn&#34;t support back, not comfortable"
1.0,"I received this watch in today's mail.  I was puzzled/disappointed to see that the digital display was VERY dim in normal mode and not much better when the EL (light) button was pressed.  I thought that maybe the watch battery (CR2025) power had deteriorated in transit due to the cold temperatures so  I replaced the battery with a brand name, factory fresh one, but the very dim display failed to improve at all.  I, personally, WOULD NOT  buy this watch again."
1.0,"Cabochon set is too small for base and is very visible on one side.  Very cheap looking.  They want me to send a picture of it.  I don't have access, but whomever inspected it before shipment did a bad job."
1.0,I have not seen the above item
1.0,Instantly uncomfortable toepost. It's an attractive shoe but the fit is wrong. Returned. BTW: I tried on a different size at Macy's and same issue :/
1.0,I wore this dress for FIVE MINUTES and it ripped FIVE MINUTES I was at a wedding and my whole back was exposed I had to leave and buy a sewing kit to sew the dress up very very very unhappy WILL NOT EVER purchase from this seller again.
1.0,This did not last one day on my grandson before the tooth fell out...I would not recommend.
1.0,outrageous how they can see clothes of that dictator who only brought hunger and misery to the Venezuelan people
1.0,I bought an adult large which was the recommended size for me. When it came in it for my 7 year old daughter.
1.0,"I'm always forgetting where I lay my glasses, so I thought this would work to keep them around my neck, but they are not nearly long enough.  I'm not sure what good they might be used for.  Complete waste of money."
1.0,It just looks kinda cheap and dingy
1.0,Don’t buy. Completely misleading from the picture.
1.0,"Too big, does not stay on ears. Does not fit ears properly."
1.0,"The one I purchased turned out to be quite flimsy, especially after being washed."
1.0,"Don’t fit as expected, and definitely make my butt look way smaller"
1.0,"Horrible, looks very cheap."
1.0,Look cheap in real time
1.0,Junk.. after an hour of wear stitching came apart in ear loop
1.0,Broke the first time I put it on cheaply made
1.0,While the dress is in my size I enjoy a much looser fitting dress. Definitely if you are like me but a size up!
1.0,Material is horrible!!
1.0,Expect what you pay for. It is cheap and looks cheap. Very disappointed. Should consider improving the quality of material
1.0,"I am upset, the material is awful.<br />It seemed as it came out of the dollar store.<br />I spoil my feets, and this thing they call slippers is out of sight. No way"
1.0,"Too tight across middle, baggie around bottom, little support from underwire. Very unflattering."
1.0,The true fit was my number one concern- no prob - the length also right on.  Very happy with my purchase.  Might buy another one soon.
1.0,This shirt had  a hole in the seam on the side. Did NOT fit properly. The cut was odd.
1.0,I like the pattern on the socks.  They are to tight & I can not get them on.  I think a waste of money.
1.0,It's one size 😒
1.0,First off I have giant feet. These will not stay on. They are too big! I spend most of my day pulling them back on my feet. I bought another brand like this and they stay perfectly all day.
1.0,The necklace came broken wish I could sent it back
1.0,Item is listed as plus size...I am 175lbs and can NOT fit them
1.0,"I wanted to give this to my daughter after the birth of her one and only daughter.  Unfortunately the card this is displayed on in the picture is not the card that came with the necklace. This one would have been perfect, but the one received was clearly intended to be gifted as a romantic gift."
1.0,These did not fit well into the boots at all. Had to return.
1.0,I would give this ZERO stars. Such cheap junk. The strap broke on the first wear. The material felt like a paper bag. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Although I got the correct size for my husband, I found it very difficult put on him.  I would not recommend this product unless you had extremely skinny legs"
1.0,This necklace is unsuitable for gift giving because its quality is so very poor.  The metal &#34;collars&#34; separating the beads from the knots are so rough that they snag clothing.  The beads themselves are quite ugly.  Sorry to have to write a review like this.  I returned the beads.
1.0,"Update<br /><br />Be advised:<br />Next Generation does not ground properly at all<br /><br />What follows is a review of the first generation:<br /><br />When I first received the product, I installed the strap per the instructions and then tested the ground connection using a ground test meter. The product does appear to ground properly according to the meter, even though my regular (non-conductive) socks.<br /><br />The adhesive is very sticky, almost like super glue, so use caution when installing.<br /><br />I have installed the strap on my running shoes. I run on pavement and also grass.<br /><br />The ground connection is better on the grass (of course) but still works on pavement that is conductive such as concrete.<br /><br />After 10 days of use, the product is still attached but starting to come off the side of the shoe and showing some wear and tear on the bottom. The bottom is still attached firmly to the shoe and that's the important part, but I am not sure how long it will last.<br /><br />I retested the grounding with a meter after 10 days and at first thought it was not working. I was ready to return the product but decided to retest the next day. I cleaned off the bottom and retested and it is actually still grounding.<br /><br />It is important to consider that you must have good conductivity to properly ground. My testing shows the grounding working even through my regular socks but only after I have worn the socks for a while which would create enough perspiration to conduct. If I put on a fresh pair of regular socks, there would not be an immediate ground connection.<br /><br />As far as how effective the product is for grounding in general, I could not say, but can only report that the meter does indicate “grounded” while wearing the product and that was my main goal with this purchase.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review with further experience and we shall see how long it lasts.<br /><br />Update<br />The bottom of the strap has come off on both sides twice now after about two months of use. I have been using superglue to reattach it. The bottom is deteriorating, not sure how much longer it will last.<br /><br />Update - strap has broken in two months and 10 days of use."
1.0,"Quality is so similar.<br />But there is NO stretch. ZERO.<br />I even bought this one in a size up to be comfy-cozy, but I can HARDLY fit my head through.<br /><br />So sad, because I’ve purchased several other colors, so I had hoped the dual color options would be the same."
1.0,"Much to large, hard to tell what foot belong in which shoe as they both go straight. And they are much bigger than they indicate..."
1.0,The material is comfortable however the measurements for the loop that goes over your ear seem short and very uncomfortable - also those strips aren't elastic so it's only adjustable with the back strap portion which sits awkwardly on your head - maybe this is good for small headed little people but for a man who's 6' tall this is a terrible product. Needs more elasticity in all parts and better adjustment options/placement in the design. 1/5 stars
1.0,The hat was much smaller that expected like child size
1.0,"I did not like these socks because even though they were thin, they didn't seem to breathe.  My feet felt constricted and hot.  They had a chemical odor when I took them out of the packaging and even after washing them there was still a slight odor."
1.0,I bought this product at other bracelet and the bracelet is great this one not so good
1.0,You can see the padded cups right through the shirt!
1.0,made for very thin men very dissatifed
1.0,"Sent back, sleeves were three quarter and not long like pictured."
1.0,I ordered an XL and got an XL but it’s maybe a youth XL at the most
1.0,Material looks and feels cheap
1.0,"We ended up buying three pairs of these pants.  They fit the boys great and the knee pads were where they were supposed to be, however the knee pads fell apart after only a couple of washings.  I even hand washed these pants and the knee pads still fell apart making them unwearable. Would not recommend."
1.0,"We’re hard to pull on .. snug.. but fit once my foot was in.  Too chunky style for me, thought they would be slimmer.  Also I wanted the toe part black with white upper.  Photo mislead me or I looked at the wrong pair.<br />I donated to the Foster Kids ( in WI)<br />I do not return things .. it’s a hassle!"
1.0,Wasn’t expecting an extra portion of a letter between BEL and AIR. Thought the material was more like a baseball Jersey but is more of a soft stretchy fabric.
1.0,The wallet looks worn out.. The metal plate and zipper are rusted..disappointed!
1.0,Not sized correctly. Did not fit at all
1.0,I gave it a 1 star because it has stretched my hole in my nose.
1.0,"Wanted it, but wasn’t offered in small....gambled on a .medium....... swallowed me ...."
1.0,Did not fit as expected and pants were not very good quality
1.0,Junk. Cheap and pitiful.
1.0,Broke and was too small anyway. A waste.
1.0,This product broke up n day 1. The magnet is so tiny you can’t handle it to put them on. Is disproportionate to the size of the earring.
1.0,Tiene un olor horrible y no se le quita con el lavado
1.0,This is not a shiny coat like the picture it’s some other material.
1.0,They run small and very thin material
1.0,R u serious?! I really paid 15.00 for one effing pair of socks?!!! And then I had to sign for my package before I got it?!? What a f***ing rip off!!
1.0,Rubs very small
1.0,Lacked fit and finish expected of fox products
1.0,"Comfortable belt just had to wait 3 months to get it, shipped from china, won't do that again"
1.0,The shirt itself is a ribbed knit and the sleeves were a cotton/linen blend It was such an obvious mismatch that I couldn't even bother to try it on. My only regret is that I didn't get a picture to show you so you can stay away from it.
1.0,Way to small and didnt fit.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:a39ceb466f5bf4db96b4eca1e586d41a]] This “boot” is a cheap, flimsy, garbage product.  It provides absolutely ZERO support or protection.  You wanted to keep your feet dry?… you’ll have to solve for the four inch gap that flaps around like a flag in a hurricane.  Seriously!  That’s how cheap and flimsy this boot is.  Check out my video for a visual.<br /><br />I bought these to work out in my chicken run, so I could hose things down while keeping my feel dry.  I legit would not give these away to a homeless person.  It would be too cruel.<br /><br />RUN AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN!"
1.0,The cap is made of inferior materials and stitches are falling apart after the first use. Needs a lot of improvement in QC'ing the products.
1.0,"Ordered sweater that took 2.5 months to deliver!! Sweater thin and flimsy, would not recommend!"
1.0,"When I opened my package, the box had some coating that had been ripped off, the gold rings do not look like gold, the color as if they were tarnishing and the rose gold rings are the color of a penny.<br />If I had to guess, these were already returned and sold again.<br />The 8mm, supposedly gold ring would not latch. I’ve tried for two days, even taking it out and it will not latch.<br />This is my personal experience but I was very dissatisfied with all aspects of these rings.<br />Just an fyi, I measured at 10mm, ordered 8mm, 10mm and 12mm, they were all too big, even the 8mm. Just something to keep in mind if you are ordering these rings."
1.0,Leather strap broke on it and now the clasp is falling apart after that just keeps getting worse
1.0,"Wrist band get loose all the time,"
1.0,"I thought this design was screen-printed, but it’s not. It looks like it was cut with a craft cutter and ironed on. I would not buy this again. I’d send it back, but don’t want to deal with the hassle. My kid won’t be wearing it anywhere. The design looks as though it will peel off when washed. Terrible quality."
1.0,Tag was cut out as if they new they didn’t have the right size in stock.
1.0,Nope. Sent back next day
1.0,The masks were cut in the middle of the picture
1.0,I ordered the extra large which was said to be equivalent to a size 16 in the size chart. There is no way this is a size 16. It’s more like a 9/10.
1.0,Paper thin material. Poor quality. Returned it.
1.0,"These are not sturdy. I tried to put it in, due to not being a hard plastic, when I thought it was going through the hole to the other side, it made the hole bleed. Do not buy this product, flimsy and definitely not worth the pain it caused."
1.0,Trying on seems ok.  The problems start when you actually try to wear it for more than a minute.  Twisted waist band.  WASTED MONEY!  Just missed my return window.  Argh.
1.0,Not of good quality even for the price.
1.0,"I would have kept this skirt if it came even close to closing so that my underthings didn't show with each step.  The large barely even came together in the front and I wear a size 10 in jeans and other pants, a medium in the last pair of pants I bought at Costco.  I don't recommend this skirt, it's too small for the average person"
1.0,Looks nothing like the pictures.
1.0,"Broke 1st day, very small"
1.0,Thes Pom Poma are attached with safety pins! Why would you put safety pins on a child’s hat!
1.0,"Horrible fit.  You can wear these 2 ways if you pull them all the way up the top of the jeans are 4 inches above the belly button.  If you put the waist down to waist level the crotch was 6 inches down you thigh causing you to walk funny (trip).  The people who made these didn't use human dimensions.  I toss mine in the rubbish, too cheap to go threw a return process.  Save your money buy else where."
1.0,"Zipper broke within the first week of my daughter wearing this coat. Unfortunately, I purchased this coat early, so the return window has closed. Save your money and purchase a better quality winter coat that you won’t need to replace within one week…"
1.0,Will be returning.  Did not help
1.0,"The dress came crammed in a bag, and not at all what the picture looks like! The material has no give to it, and it is Ill fitting. The trim does not sit on the edge, so the serger seams show and the trim is on the other side of it. There is no way I am able to wear this. Very poor quality, disappointing as I really liked the dress that was shown. I would NOT recommend to buy!"
1.0,Not happy with quality.  One of them had to be put back together as a feather had fallen off.  It was going to be a gift for a friend who collects dream catchers but it will just lay in a drawer here.  Too much hassle to return.
1.0,Gave away the fit funny and not comfortable at all. And not full length if you are  taller then 5'8
1.0,it looks much better on the website than it actually is.
1.0,Poor quality. Zipper was broken.
1.0,Robe came without sash... kinda defeats the purpose.
1.0,"One shirt out of the pack will turn yellowish/cream in the sun.  It looks fine in the house.  When we go outside, it changes.  The threads stay white so it looks very odd.  People noticed.  If these are for a base layer and no one sees it, fine.  But I do not recommend if you want the shirt to be seen."
1.0,Way to big just donated!
1.0,"Vacuum packed, hard, flat, completely unusable! I have some very disappointed Kindergartners!!"
1.0,Large hole under the arm.
1.0,Size. Not specified correctly
1.0,"This belt fell apart after less than 10 days, was not even used every day."
1.0,"This product is not a dress, let alone a wrap dress. The pictures and description are not accurate. It is actually a short sleeve cardigan-like item with a small button in the middle."
1.0,My bracelet started calling apart after 3 weeks- I haveotsof similar bracelets that I've had for years.
1.0,Soft & pretty but such poor quality. It is literally falling apart after a week.  This was my husband's Christmas gift. Total bummer.
1.0,"The material is weird, like costume material. The sleeves have red and purple squares. Nothing like the shirt that is pictured. Will be returning."
1.0,My daughter could not even pull these up her legs. No stretch.
1.0,"My wife received these ""unbreakable"" glasses broken."
1.0,I went to put the earrings on and the clasp broke.  They were inexpensive and not worth the hassle to return. Lesson learned.
1.0,i liked the shirt but it arrived with a small hole on the shoulder so i returned it
1.0,This must be the only product that I have a purchase through Amazon which is extremely not only disappointing but revolting and I don’t like using these words it is the horrible fabric it falls apart in your head buttons missing cheap cheapest could be I don’t know where this was made but you should stop selling this products from this organization is starting to make AMAZON look extremely bad
1.0,The dress was poorly made it and it did not even go across both shoulders in the extra large. The body of the wrap may have been close to size but the top runs very small.<br /><br />The size chart is way off and I do not recommend that if you want to wear this dress you buy it based on the size chart. The print is beautiful but the material is very sheer.
1.0,"This does not look like how it is pictured nor how I expected it to be. It looks like someone went in their basement, printed a V logo on a printer and melted it on the shirt. The colors are blurry, it’s peeling and is very low quality. Highly do NOT recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Cut strange and too small.  Orders size up or 2.
1.0,Too loose and not true to size
1.0,"Really disappointed. It looks so dull, not as shinny as picture. Also, light weight that feels like a piece of plastic. Don’t waste your money. Not worth it!"
1.0,"Worst socks I have ever owned. Aside from the fact they they are not warm at all and don't keep my feet warm, they're also very slippery and don't sit well on my feet. The worst part though is that they're leaving fuzz balls everywhere in the house! It's ridiculous!!!"
1.0,Item came with stones already missing. Not very well made. Save your money. Disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered two of these in different colors, but both in the same size, one true to size the other about 2 sizes smaller."
1.0,Do not recommend!! The collar was so big (loose) my son never wore it.
1.0,Only used it one week
1.0,"Junk, broke first time I put it on,"
1.0,Product damage  not good quality product
1.0,"Bizarre sizing.  I am a size 6.  I ordered a small.  I did this because there was a note that sizes had been adjusted in 2016.  Yet, the sleeves were at least 3 inches too long.  I've never had fit issues with arm length.  The rest of the coat was bulky and unbecoming.  And back it goes!"
1.0,Terrible product. I’ve never had a chain break and this broke the day after I got it. I paid to have it fixed and it broke again.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. It's cheap almost see through polyester nylon like material.
1.0,Not much stretch and it’s not true to size. It fits small.
1.0,It’s more for a man
1.0,The dress fit way smaller than what it should have.
1.0,"Item was described as 100% cotton but when it arrived, it was 100% polyester! Annoying waste of my time to have to package it up and mail it back. This scarf was misrepresented. There is no excuse fir dishonest listing. I am Extremely disappointed!"
1.0,Excited to finally have one.  Charged the battery overnight .  Geared up in the am for a 25 mile atv run.  5 minutes into the ride it became painfully obvious that it wasn’t going to get warm and I needed more layers.  Light came on.  Battery said 100%.  Never got warm.  Spend $10-$20 more and get the Milwaukee.
1.0,The item was misrepresented in size and look<br />It was very short  in length. I was very disappointed!
1.0,Sorry this was a ladies wallet not shoes..
1.0,The fit seems off when you pull them up around the waist. They seem like they were sewn a bit off
1.0,"Not as shown in pictures, material is awful,reminds me of fire retardant material!"
1.0,Ugly color and material  looks not like the picture
1.0,"Bought these as a gift for a friend & when she tried to put them in her ear, the earring cracked and broke! Definitely not worth buying and waiting the weeks it took to arrive."
1.0,I ordered a 1x per sizing guidelines. It was much much smaller!
1.0,Ripped in a couple places after less than a month
1.0,This particular blouse was cut too short by 2 inches.<br />The cut is good and roomy. Very flattering.  I have 3 other ones that are longer.. I love them.  Very nice with necklace and cardigan.
1.0,"very cheaply made, doesn't look as pictured.....rums very small"
1.0,"The silicone case doesn't actually fit the gotcha properly, and doesn't hold it securely. The strap is chintzy garbage. Returning this immediately, avoid this company's products at all costs."
1.0,I would have never purchased these earrings if I had known I wouldn’t be able to wear them. They are very flimsy and cheaply made they bend and almost break when you are trying to just put them in. I wore a pair to work when I got there I realized the little plastic thing had fallen off and the earring was about to fall out. I took them out and put them in my locker. I will not ever try to wear another pair..
1.0,There doesn't fit
1.0,"This pin was nothing like the picture shown, it’s made out of a very cheap material, is poorly made, and is worth probably $3 or less, not $10."
1.0,"disappointing, all the black came of in 3days"
1.0,It’s terrible a wast of money
1.0,The necklace I received was very disappointing. There is a lot of discoloration in the chain and locket itself. It’s ruined. I won’t be wearing it that’s for sure. Returned!
1.0,Cheap looking and several stone were missing
1.0,This jacket came from China and I offered an Xl.  My niece who is a xs was able to wear..  It fit her perfectly.  Do not order!
1.0,"These earrings are very cheap, but are still terribly quality for compared to other jewelry you can buy for this price. One of the two dangle earrings are decent and flexible as advertised, but the other one is completely stiff and covered with globs of what looks like solder! I would have been happy with my order if both were at least the same quality as the one flexible one but you can see in the pictures that the solder is just everywhere, even on the ring that goes on the stud itself. Really unhappy with this purchase and will be returning"
1.0,"They are pretty, but the stone fell out immediately out of the box (before they could ever be put on)! Very disappointed."
1.0,Tried to return the dress and I needed to pay shipping. Which came up to $120. Absurd. Dress is too big even and very still material.
1.0,Liked the band at first.  The loops came off that hold tail of watchband. Band itself didn't hold up to blue collar work life.
1.0,Could not see out of the eyes. The first one did not even work had to get a replacement.
1.0,Sharp plastic shards in every stitch. Ouch!
1.0,WAY Too small for 3xl— too tight bust.<br /><br />Plus grey lining that shows at neck and sleeves when rolled up totally ruins beautiful blue design.
1.0,This incubator could not hold its temperature as set. Continually sounded the alarm 24 hours a day. I returned this item back to seller and was refunded my money
1.0,"Well priced, but very small short.  Inseam was incredibly short and leg cuffs were super tight.  The waist fit as described, but the very small leg cuffs of this short literally made it immediately painful to wear.  As a mostly endurance rider, I have small diameter legs as well.  The pad seemed to only have foam, but was advertised as a gel pad.  The ratio design of this short seems skewed as the waist seems fairly true to size, while the length (inseam) and leg cuff appear to be drastically smaller."
1.0,Size is not accurate way too big
1.0,"I'm guessing this works in rare rare cases for folks with a minor snoring issue.  Do yourself a favor and take get a sleep study.  I didn't think I was that bad, but found out through a sleep study that I had severe Sleep Apnea and now have a CPAP ... thank goodness for my long term heath."
1.0,"EXTREMELY TOO SMALL. I  CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE THE TIME LIMIT EXPIRED. 4X IS NOT A 4X,IT'S MORE LIKE A LARGE. SAVE YOUR $."
1.0,"Cheaply constructed.  Chain broke within the first few days, daughter cried.  Recommend don't buy."
1.0,"I ordered before there were any reviews, had I seen a review, I would have stayed away. I knew it would be encased in some sort of resin, but the item is damaged with what appear to be tool marks. Scratches aside, in my opinion it looks nice, the stones look authentic, but everything that glitters is not gold. I purchased it for the EMF protection but now I'm wondering how can it protect from inside thick plastic? Overall, it doesn't fit. Typically bangles are expected to be a little larger and to dangle, not sure why the mold is cast so small, especially since there is no one size buyer. To put it into perspective, my 60lb 10 year old had a difficult time getting on their wrist and when they did it fit pretty snug."
1.0,"Usually shopping on Amazon is convenient.  This time was not one of them.  Just received this mask.  Put on and cant see at all.  (supposed to see out of nose?)  literally like looking through a keyhole.  Don't Try taking a step, it would be like walking with your eyes closed.  Assuming you can not return because so many customers were returning as it is pure garbage.  OK to buy if you plan on standing like a statue.  Truely a danger if you intend to move at all."
1.0,It was literally huge it was completely unwearable I’m so upset my baby shower is in 2 days and now I have to figure out where I can find another dress in such short notice I put my measurements in and got the exact opposite I’ve never been so disappointed
1.0,Came in a tiny box not as described at all
1.0,I am a true small in many clothes and sometimes for a looser shape I go to medium… this barely went on and when it did I was sucked to a complete pancake. It was too low cut to pass onto my 12yr old so I returned.
1.0,It’s literally just a T-shirt.<br />It’s not cut any way to fall off the shoulder it’s just a big sloppy T-shirt
1.0,I sent it back. The color was not apricot. It was beige. Very disappointed
1.0,"I tried on the dress for the first time and it ripped in the front. Cute dress, cheap fabric. Now I’m stuck with a dress that I can’t teturn because I’m passes my return window."
1.0,"I was hoping for a fit like the T-shirt dress, but it hangs poorly.  I returned it."
1.0,I'm 5'4 and 135lbs and this was not flattering in any way.
1.0,"Not solid yellow gold. Jeweler confirmed. Also, quickly moved toward jeweler’s magnetic wand. They do look beautiful, but you don’t get what you pay for. $99 👎🏼"
1.0,Pretty but runs very big
1.0,this coat is flimsy and not heavy and will not keep you warm in cold weather like a jacket
1.0,Completely see through. And the material feels cheap.
1.0,Button popped off the 1st time I wore them! Spent the whole evening worried about the zipper breaking!
1.0,Cheap and small...ridiculous....
1.0,"Photo is deceiving. Fabric is stiffer and white trim looks like embroidery but actually is a stiff white iron on applique which looks plastic, unattractive, cheap."
1.0,Zipper not well mAde
1.0,It's broken or the right ear isn't there but I'm gonna find a whole one one day
1.0,I ordered these to protect my hands from a sun allergy. The fingers are too short to cover where I get a rash. These are very cheap gloves. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"I have never had a gym bag that weighed more than the contents I would put in it but this one did!  With training shoes, workout clothing, airpods, phone, toiletries, the bag weighed far more than what was inside it.  I immediately returned it.  Although probably durable, who would lug around such a heavy bag?  Not me!  I life at the gym, not with my gym bag.  I don't recommend it to anyone."
1.0,Had less than a month and it broke. horrible
1.0,"We bought this umbrella right before a trip to a rainy location. We opened it once, and marveled at the design. Then, we placed it in the overhead compartment on the plane, and when we landed it had been stolen. So we bought a second umbrella, and this we had a chance to use—just a few times, because the wiring inside started to rip through the cloth, until it poked on the other side and now it doesn't lock into place when you unfold it. It's useless now, basically. I guess it's some sort of consolation to think that the stolen umbrella also ripped into pieces like the second one."
1.0,"Leather cheap looking Crocs, super ugly. Returned within minutes of trying them on."
1.0,its a sports bra
1.0,"Shorter than most lanyards. When I put my badge on the lanyard, it would not sit flat."
1.0,This is what was sent to me. Fresh out of the box.
1.0,Poor fit - too small. Button popped off within hours. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Love the dress, the reason for the one star is bc<br />I found black spots on the back of the dress<br />After the length of time it took to receive the dress and its damaged. This was so disappointing"
1.0,Was very interested in this product and really liked it until I was disappointed when the coin itself not the chain broke within 2 days.
1.0,I never ordered this item.
1.0,Washed once and the material got small balls all over like a sweater would with age.<br />I’m returning this asap for a refund!!
1.0,I ordered crochet hair nets for work. I was very displeased with alot of smaller sizes in the package. I have very long hair and I put it in a ponytail and then put hairnet on. Half of them looked like children sizes<br /> I wont order them again. I will have to find them someplace else.
1.0,The material is cheap. It is see-through. Junk
1.0,They are really tight so I could only wear them just above the knees and some of them has a really thin top so I couldn't wear them at all because they cute off my circulation which sucks because they're soft and cute. I'm 5.4 123lb.
1.0,Can’t use these to even walk in daylight they’re so dark
1.0,way too big and the shape is really awkward. It looks like someone cut off the metal part of a binder clip.
1.0,I absolutely love the fit and color. Only complaint is that I wore them exactly once and then washed them and the seam came out when I took them out of the dryer! :(<br /><br />^ this was my review of my first pair received in october 2019. They sent me a replacement pair after this happened.<br />The exact same thing happened to my replacement pair (received 11/13/2019) after wearing 3-4 times!!! the last two pics are of the replacement pair. First 3 pictures are of the 1st pair.
1.0,"Too thin, looks like nylon tights 20 den"
1.0,"I bought this set for my niece for Christmas 2022. When I received them, they were VERY lightweight. I don't mean breathable or anything. I mean see-through-thin. I was irritated, especially since this was mid-winter.<br /><br />I would not recommend it."
1.0,This pair was poorly made.  Bent the very first day of wearing.  After wearing a couple times they were no longer wearable.
1.0,"Not leather, some sort of faux leather covering over a padded material. After about 2-3 weeks of daily use started cracking/peeling where the buckle goes. Would not advise purchasing since it won't last more than 15-20 uses."
1.0,Cheap cotton not worth the money made out of bad T-shirt material very disappointing
1.0,Ripped out after a month of use! Not a good product!
1.0,I was so excited for this dress- it’s so so cute! But mine came with a tear on the back seam! The fabric is super thin.
1.0,"This product runs way small, so a 2xxl is like miniature size."
1.0,Its made of super cheap halloween costume material. Really awful. Don't buy. Not worth the time to return it.
1.0,"Don't waste your money on this blouse, it was very cheap made, the necklace is cheap plastic. Should of known better."
1.0,Arrived broken. Missing a screw that holds the lense on. Wasn't even in the box to try to fix it myself.
1.0,"The description clearly says the $89 is for 12 umbrellas, yet I received 1!"
1.0,for a 900.00 phone very cheaply made broke as soon as i clipped it together
1.0,"Don’t waste your money. I was so excited to receive this goat. It fit like a I’ll made blanket. The material was falling off, so I wrapped it up and sent it off to Goodwill. Only kept for 5 minutes."
1.0,"When I purchased these they were billed as 80% cotton/20% poliester.  I don't believe it.  They don't look like cotton.  They don't feel like cotton.  On the packaging they come with it just says ""cotton"" with no other information about the fiber, doesn't give the percentage, nothing.  Maybe the manufacturer thought ""cotton"" was a style, rather than a fiber??"
1.0,Cheaply made. Smells. One zipper broke. Sending back.
1.0,It was ripped.
1.0,I didint got the wind proof black skull yet
1.0,"Although I love the style and have ordered these harem style pants before, I did not like the fabric of these. Instead of cool cotton, these are shiny rayon. The fabric defeats the purpose, retaining heat, and looking cheap to boot. Not a keeper, sadly."
1.0,"Very small item, not even an inch close to size description! Don't buy this seller's products!"
1.0,got those for the summer time not only they were too big for my face they broke within a month and a half. they fell off of me and broke total rip off. and will not buy again
1.0,Worthless if you are moving around. They do not stay on the arm. As I was moving it kept floping down to my elbow till I just tore them off.
1.0,Ordered a new home owner 2020 and received a new home owner 2019. Not happy!
1.0,This turned brown its fake...I will upload a picture..Watch where you shop.
1.0,"not for everyone, by everyone I mean me."
1.0,I am a curvy woman and this dress didn’t favor me.😩 but I love love the design and material was good.
1.0,"They are very cheap, so tempting. I bought them thinking that I would give them a shot. Sadly the cut off the clothing was horrible and I sent them back. I have very long limbs and the shorts still went past my knees. The jersey was way too long went down past my butt and groin, was the same length in the front and back, witch a cycling jersey is not supposed to be. The chest area had a lot of extra material for some reason, made a big pouch when leaning over. I had my wife try the jersey on and it fit her better through the chest because of her breasts, but it was still way too long. The print on the jersey didn't line up when closed, witch was annoying but for the price I would have been ok with. The chamois is cheap foam, to be expected. Bottom line, you won't be able to wear them, so don't waste your money."
1.0,The brim is more than a 360 degree circle and does not stay over your face for shade. It curls up
1.0,"I am debating on returning this case. I was super excited to see a case with recesses for the back of controllers and extra space for the joysticks, but the recesses are misaligned and are too close together to the switch &#34;rocks&#34; back and forth without being properly seated in the recesses. There's also too much room around the edges of the case that allow a lot of movement. This case was not well designed. I'm going to try to find a different case that fits better."
1.0,"I thought this loop was going to fit, but it doesn't. I filled out the return form with a question about returning this item and received no response!"
1.0,This top runs so small. Too tight on me. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheaply made unwearable
1.0,I don't know who said these socks were easy on easy off but they were not
1.0,Cuando lo coloque en la plancha se quemó  completamente. Este producto no sirve para sublimar.
1.0,Terrible quality.  Waste of money
1.0,It did not fit me nice and I hated this material.  Very synthetic feel and wasn't form fitting.  I love cotton stretch tanks and thought these may be similar but they definitely were not.  Some people may like this athletic/synthetic type fabric though.
1.0,The quality of these boots is poor. They started falling apart shortly after purchasing and my son constantly complains about how uncomfortable they are. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Very cute for my 5 yr old but broke trying to put them in her ears.  Pinched her ear, required plyers....needless to say, I returned them.  They are supposed to snap shut but broke instead.  They were cute though....just flimsy."
1.0,"Very strange fit - arms way too short and the cuffs are also odd...and  yes, SO uncomfortable.  Couldn't wait to sent it back...."
1.0,Broke after only three gentle wears.
1.0,"I bought a size small for my 5'4&#34; 128 lbs frame, as I'm usually a small. The thing looks like a balloon! The fit is completely weird and material thin! Don't think I can wear it as is even with a belt sadly."
1.0,Button ripped out after wearing once. Very poor quality
1.0,Doesn’t fit around nose supper baggy tried on a couple peaple same affect
1.0,Not impressed. Its doesnt fit good and it almost look like a panty
1.0,Super tight not true to size do not stretch and dig in
1.0,Arrived broken. Had to return. Adorable earrings but not great quality.
1.0,"Feels soft and comfortable, but it must be an irregular. The straps do not align to the bra on the front; thus, the corners just hang loosely and fits really odd."
1.0,I gave this item to a friend and it was not what I expected..the sleeves was different and it did not hang like the photo as seen
1.0,"Defects, lines running down legs that are not wrinkles or suppose to be there. Sizing is off. The color is as described. I own another same style/brand w/o defects. Returning is not the easiest. Happier with my new pair w/o defects & good customer service."
1.0,"Very disappointed. Fit is great, however these are NOT 2.50. I can't read with these at all. I had another person try them on that also wears 2.50, he could not see out of them either. I have no way of knowing if the wrong pair were sent to me or not, as the box is not showing the magnification,  that I can tell. It has LPN RR BG175 8653. I rechecked my order to make sure I marked 2.50 and I did."
1.0,"The item itself is gorgeous. However, the size of ring is described as &#34;free&#34; which would indicate an adjustable ring. However, it is most definitely Not adjustable. I bought 2 for my 20s murder mystery party tomorrow and they are completely unusable. So disappointed upset."
1.0,"I got a dress with a v neck and pink spots all over, when I ordered the paint splashed one. The armpits are too big and all over frumpy. Returning."
1.0,"defective--very large pulled yarn right in front, which I would try to fix except the sleeves are way too long.  Will have to return. Defect was totallly visable thru the bag."
1.0,Horrible quality... Didn't survive unwrapping. Horrible sizing too!
1.0,"Ordered these, came in wrong wash. Sizing is completely off. Not sure what is going on left leg hem. Look completely sloppy on. Unflattering, cheap material. These are being returned right after opening.  I do not recommend."
1.0,My husband’s glasses have ear pieces that are extended a bit and his glasses wouldn’t fit. It is quite bulky as well. We returned the product.
1.0,Get size up<br />Be aware not free return!!!
1.0,Dress came in wrong color & wasn't the material I was expecting - that may have been my mistake for not reading throughly. Clingy polyester & looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,loose stone sent bacl
1.0,"The shoulder area is too wide. Making you look like Dopey from Snow White. Just an overall badly made shirt, with a cheap fabric. Also the color is different (in a bad way) from what is shown."
1.0,"This bag has poor craftsmanship, I use it to hold my golf clothes and toiletries. The bag has already torn and is way to small for my needs."
1.0,Do not last<br />Fall apart<br />Worst purchase
1.0,"zero stars for this plastic, hollow, definitely not wood mala"
1.0,"Received this with 2 different pieces unattached to the necklace. Had to super glue back together...not very good quality, but what do you expect for such cheap price."
1.0,"This umbrella was crap. It was pretty, but the graphic isn't as bright as shown, it's more faded. I bought it for a vacation to Ireland and it didn't even last one drizzley day with light breezes. It constantly flipped inside out at the slightest breeze and the arms got all bent by the end of the day. I left it in a garbage can in Dublin. It would probably be ok for a sunny day."
1.0,Awful and awkward fit.  It did nothing for the shape of my breast. It was a waste of money and you could probably only get a couple of uses out of it. I ended up not even using it for my photo shoot and bought a real strapless bra.
1.0,"Was sent a completely different pair of jeans. Just because they are same brand and light blue does not mean they are same pants and they should not be represented as what is in picture. Pocket shape is different and these are the Butt enhancing jeans. Clearly not what is pictured. (For record, I ordered a 5 but they were too small ao I sent them back and that was as pictured but from a different provider). Beware of those sold from “Planet Nine”."
1.0,T shirt material. Not classy at all
1.0,"One of the many features that attracted me to this bathing suit was the build in push up bra and overall conservative yet sexy design. However, when I tried this on it was a huge disappointment and waste of non refundable money.<br />For starters, the buttons were loose upon arrival and fell off while trying it on. The straps are so short that it hurts your neck, continuously comes unhooked & forces the crotch of the suit to ride up in your lady parts. And the most annoying part is that there is NO push-up bra! When I reached out to do a return because it is not as advertised I was denied a refund."
1.0,I give this product a two star rating because one of the lights I received doesn't work. I tried changing the battery in it and it still won't come on. It's not worth shipping to ship back to the seller to have them ship me a new one. The other one I recieved works just fine. Just stinks becuase I will have to order another light to replace the one that doesn't work. Oh well. Cheap lights made in china I guess. Other than that I actually really love this product. It's easy to click and turn on. It has a solid light or it blinks slowly or quickly depending on which one you want. It's pretty bright for a little light and I can see my black dog out in the yard at night when I let her out to go potty. I like this too for when we go on walks at night or if we are camping so other people can see her and they know she's coming. She's very large and quiet and I don't want people to be afraid of her so it's better if they have a heads up by seeing her first. It's a safety thing too with cars when we're on a walk at night. It's best if they can see both her and myself easily.
1.0,I brought the biggest size and it was still too small
1.0,Something wrong in this blouse. The cut from arm and shoulder part is not right. The lace part looks cheap and I didn’t like it in general. I don’t recommend it.
1.0,I should have known better than to buy jewelry that was about $3.  It took forever to arrive from China and then it's quality was something from a bubble gum $.25 machine.  Do not waste your money.
1.0,It is paper thin<br />Color was extremely too light<br />The only way to exchange or return was a 30% discount. I refused and was offered 50% with no other choice..
1.0,Not happy at all! Received watch and did not work. Hands were off-sync and would not wind properly. Poorly packaged.
1.0,They run small you need to order a size up. If you wear a 8 order a 9.
1.0,Glasses broke the third day after I received them.
1.0,"Wore my sticky bra today and it was a nightmare. I just want to start out by saying that I ordered my correct size according to the site. I put the bra on and it stuck initially. The more I moved my body the less it stuck. At one point the bottom completely came unstuck from my body and started scratching me. They the sides of the bra came unstuck. I had to take the bra off after just 2hours of putting it on. I was in the middle of Arlington national cemetery having to take my bra off because I couldn't handle it anymore. I eventually had to just go the rest off my day walking around braless. Not happy, a sticky bra is supposed to stick and stay stuck; not practically fall off after 2 hours!"
1.0,"The sizes offered were 6-12 months or 12-18 months.. my son will be 12 months in May but is already wearing size 12mo. So, we got 12-18mo... the tag says 18mo and it is way too big for him. Yes, I expected it to fit a little big but not size 18mo big. I wonder what I would have received if I had ordered 6-12 mo. Seller should adjust their sizes on the product appropriately. Returning and finding a different outfit for his 1st birthday."
1.0,Not worth it. One wear and it rust. Save yourself from wasting your change.
1.0,"I would not recommend this shirt to an American woman, it is made in China and runs extremely small. The quality is good, I went up one size and it still didn’t fit."
1.0,"Way too small, bad quality"
1.0,Broke as my wife tried putting it on 😡
1.0,These did not work to keep feet warm or dry. And they were NOT soft
1.0,"fits good but zipper broke just trying it on, I have to return it"
1.0,Too big. I purchased this for my son who needs help with keeping his glasses in place due to flat bridge of his nose. This was too big and didnt stay on his frames right
1.0,Will be returning these.  I received a white lace and black though description states gold and black.
1.0,I got these and like many others they got runs or was unraveling with the first time putting them on.. sorry even though they aren't much I won't be buying them again..
1.0,"I liked this hat because of the fact it did not have a Nike swoosh on the front of it. When I received the hat it had a large white Nike symbol on the front of the hat. The hat was great quality, but does not look like the picture shown at all."
1.0,I was so disappointed. I have many stud earrings  that are secure for days sometimes weeks. I lost one within a few hours of wearing. It was like the hole on back was to large when screwing to post.
1.0,Terrible purchase! It literally came apart when I opened it and tried to attach it to my naval.  Please save your money!
1.0,"Wallet is very stiff, not convinced it is leather. Will be going back"
1.0,"Was a big fan of Wenger, but no more because just died after 7 months.  I tried a new battery… no joy.  Such a disappointment"
1.0,Mine came with colored jewels. Very Upsetting.
1.0,The strings started to separate until it eventually came apart completely after a month.
1.0,Ugly. Not as pictured.
1.0,"No la recomiendo ni una semana me duró. He comprado otras pulceras de igual o menor precio, y me han salido de excelente calidad.<br />No la recomiendo."
1.0,Items were way too big!  Not very attractive.
1.0,It was broke when  I received it .
1.0,End pieces don't align not matter how many times you keep turning them. So you have it in and one gem is point forward and the other is pointing backward. Wouldn't buy again. Also my ear got infected after having it in for 1.5 days.
1.0,I was not able to wear the necklace. It arrived broken!
1.0,did not like the dress way to plain .not made well at all
1.0,Do not like this item very flimsy will not support my breast. I would like a better made bra.
1.0,"Started to ball up after I only wore it twice. Very cheap quality, especially for the price. After wearing it for a week it looks like it’s 25 years old. I wouldn’t wear it out of the house now. And it’s not washable. Only dry clean and no tag anywhere on the sweater."
1.0,I orderthis  boot for toddler and you send it’s for adult. Very Supporting
1.0,"Way too large, making them look cheap."
1.0,These are horrible. The straps are too long and they are too stretchy to be a sports bra. No way anyone can workout in them. I got a deal on them and they were still sent back immediately.<br /><br />I suggest you leave this page immediately!
1.0,"The wallet just fall apart after couple uses, poorly made stitches and had to throw it away since the main function to hold cards no longer can be used. Very disappointed and bought it based on good reviews but it seems that reviews on this product been manipulated..<br />do not recommend this product"
1.0,"Terrible quality and very ill fitting and even though I was told 10 day shipping, it took a month.  Returned."
1.0,Product was delivered and the bow was detached from the back. I had to glue it back myself.
1.0,"Very disappointed. I rarely write negative reviews,  generally because I research products as well as I can before making purchases, for which I thank my fellow helpful Amazon reviewers<br />I bought a cloth hobo bag from Amazon a couple of years ago, and loved it.  Thought this time I would try something a little more mature looking. This bag looks nice, but is not made that well, especially around the areas where it needs to be tough.<br />I'll be the first to admit I'm hard on purses.  I carry A LOT of stuff with me. But this bag is coming apart way too soon.<br />It's a shame, too, because it's roomy. It's got  three interior sections, the center of which is zippered.  Inside the bag, one sidewall has two  pockets; one that fits my big ol' cellphone just right. The other inside wall has a zippered pocket.<br />But as you can see in my picture,  the rings that hold the bag""s strap have already come out of their housing and I've been using the bag less than a month.<br />I guess I'll figure out a way to rig something to fix it because I hate to trash the bag. It wasn't expensive, but it wasn't cheap, either (to me, anyway).<br />I really wish I'd bought another cloth hobo bag. At least I could reinforce it with my sewing machine.<br />Sorry I spent the money on this purse."
1.0,Terrible rusted the first week then broke
1.0,I ordered finesse and got real friends instead which is very disappointing because it’s not as advertised.
1.0,I loved the way it looked but it was very fragile. It broke the same day I got it and my hands are pretty small. I was opening a door and the chain around my middle finger broke.smh Guess you get what you pay for! *Shrug*
1.0,Inside it was sewn all wrong and has extra material causing a big lump where front of hat and brim meet. Also on last snap It does not fit at all. I put it on my 2 yo grandsons head and it fits him  And has loose fibers and the L in love has threads loose. NO. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"Nice fabric, but the large fits more like a small"
1.0,I am not one to do reviews but this product was so misleading I had to.  There is no glitter and no stones.  Very disappointed as this was orders to match for prom.  It’s noting more than a cotton mask with painted specks on it.
1.0,Crystal ball not on jewelry. Arrived broken.<br />No paperwork to prove it’s real sterling silver.<br />Waste of time and money.<br />Now to look for another gift 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1.0,I hate it.. I needed it for my upcoming wedding. They do not support naturally larger breasts.  I''m a 34DD and they didn't support them at all and basically smashed them making them look awkward. Very disappointed.
1.0,One of the clips used to grip the sock is broken.  What is the return policy for this item?  I would like another as soon as possible if you have one that works.  Very dissatisfied with this purchase.
1.0,"I was so excited to see the arrival of my St. Patrick’s watch band. However, when I opened it, the package wording was correct, but the watch was Halloween cats. So disappointed:("
1.0,The snaps are very tight and threaten to rip the fabric if attempted to open.
1.0,Dont buy it .  Poor  quality too small  waste of money
1.0,"To start off.. this looks nothing like the one the model is wearing in the picture description. It is super flimsy and not made well... I don't know why it comes up as a sports bra... but if you have any sort of breasts, please do not purchase this. I don't like how easily it was riding up and basically exposed me when I was trying to keep it all in at the gym.<br /><br />Terrible quality, no wonder it was so cheap.<br /><br />Returned for a refund."
1.0,I don't like them. They are an awkward size and strange to wear. The large pearl goes behind the ear. It just doesn't look right.
1.0,Worst product ever!!!!!!! Run 3 sizes to small and look nothing like the picture.
1.0,Fit my daughter who wears an xs :(
1.0,"With my 10.5 medium feet, my heels fall out to the inside of these slippers. This does make it hard to walk in them and uncomfortable. My feet also feel kind od damp and clammy in them. I think it is the plastic bag problem with no natural fiber or ventilation. I've had them about 4 weeks now and they will be retired early."
1.0,"I didn’t even get the right thing at all it is some ,  flimsy  String with a bead!!!!"
1.0,Didn’t like it at all. Scratchy material  and uncomfortable to wear
1.0,poor quality.  Already has holes in pockets!
1.0,I returned these immediately as they were so tiny that only a small child or baby could wear them.
1.0,The wrist band was worn out and broken. Do not recommend buying these.

1.0,Within 10 minutes of wearing these the stand of rhinestones fell off.
1.0,"I purchased four sets of 6 socks. In each pack, there was two or three pairs of socks thAt were too small. Truly a different size then the other socks and I couldn't put on"
1.0,Not flattering .... brim is way to long ... covered my face i couldn’t see .... bought for Hawaii and didn’t even use
1.0,It runs little
1.0,Knock off cheap ban poor metal closure had to struggle putting it on.
1.0,These were flare cut and not bootcut even though they are marked bootcut.
1.0,I put this dress on and immediately started sweating. The material is awful and the least breathable material I have ever tried.
1.0,"This is not long like the picture. Pictures gives the illusion of a high low type frock, but it’s not. Picture looks like it goes to the knees, it does not. Pretty unhappy with this item to be honest."
1.0,Basura fatra Gabe
1.0,"These were much too large, and 2 different sizes!"
1.0,Doesn’t stay in ear. Terrible cheap material
1.0,"Awful dress, even for the price. The material that the bottom portion is made of even looks cheap. I would never wear this dress. I thought the photo was cute tho. I guess I'm just going to use this dress as scrape fabric, minus the bottom shirt like portion which went in the trash."
1.0,"My bra straps showed, the waist band was bunchy, and my top was too prominent.  Returned it."
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Size was at keast 4 times smaller then said
1.0,"UPDATE:  Don't waste your money, although I REALLY liked it it's already fallen apart and I haven't even had it on my wrist a month yet!  Very disappointed.  I noticed last week one side of the band starting to separate from the watch and last night it broke.  Appears to have small screws in it which one is completely missing??<br /><br />Solid soft band, easy to attach and locks into place.  Buckle centers perfectly on my wrist.  I really like the buckle attachment, feels more secure than the punch one that comes from Samsung.  Still in my first week of wearing it so can't comment on durability.  Hoping they offer more colors down the road (unless I missed them)?"
1.0,Junk cheap looking nothing like picture.
1.0,"It looks nice but the straps broke when I went to adjust the girls, I'm so sad because it's such a pretty dress."
1.0,I bought this and the seem is torn out of it like someone has worn it.. and it fits like a xl
1.0,These are useless because lens pop out easily and frequently
1.0,"One of the straps on the boots was broken. So disappointed, my daughter was really excited about getting new boots, and despite being Prime members, it wasn't Prime shipping - wasn't worth the extra wait!"
1.0,Cheap quality. I wouldn’t recommend
1.0,"I liked the fabric. The cut and size are terrible.  It barely covered one leg. I think the model is wearing two wraps, one on each side. Don't expect this to be a skirt on its own."
1.0,Very thin. Water leaks in and feet freeze. Will be buying different one from sporting store instead.
1.0,"fell out within the first week, and i diligently make sure my jewelry is screwed on tight at least four - six times a day and especially before i go to sleep. woke up and the top was gone and nowhere to be found &lt;/3 it was beautiful while it lasted but be warned that the external thread is not very long"
1.0,Lights died in less than 3 days.
1.0,Not shorts
1.0,Poorly made doesn’t look like the picture<br />Had to keep too expensive to return to sender(China)
1.0,Both gloves ripped at the seams on my first trip snowboarding.
1.0,"I am pretty tech savvy and I can not, for the life of me, get this hat to sync with anything! I have 4 different phones in my home and several blue tooth compatible devices that all work from my phones and this hat just refuses to pair with my phone. The hat itself is well made and very comfortable but I bought it for my son to have music in his hat. Any suggestions?"
1.0,this was a very cute sweater but they delivered the wrong color i ordered and it qas ripped from the shoulder. bummer!!!
1.0,My teenage son has giant feet (13.5). He reported that these are way too tight to be comfortable.
1.0,No me agrada está con viñeta cortada
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:ff3c024fc86b7e2b4c538824602d785d]] This watch is not safe! My daughter loved this watch until one day it got extremely hot and made a high pitch squeal and would not respond to any inputs. We were able to remove the back and jiggle the attached battery to stop the sound and unfreeze the screen and promptly turned it off.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon who tried to have me remove the battery but it is soldered on and cannot be removed. Because it had been more than 30 days, I could not get a refund. I then emailed LOL’s customer support and they emailed me a number to call. After 47 minutes on hold, I hung up. I emailed customer support again asking for my money back and was told I could try if it had been less than 30 days.<br /><br />My daughter who paid for the watch is devastated!"
1.0,Low quality craftsmanship. Material feels nice but they’ll be my homebody shorts.
1.0,A lot bigger than expected
1.0,"Please be very careful about ordering the purple hat.  I received one that had a very dark color rosette, more of a black.  The rosette is not as full and neat as the one shown also.  It had a very small spiral.  I was buying this to match an outfit I have and I will have to take the ugly rosette off and sew a new one in a color that matches because I do not have time to wait for another to be shipped.  The size and style of the hat is great.  It is a shame this was not as pictured!"
1.0,Fits uncomfortably and the seems are off. Not worth the money !
1.0,"Material is very shiny, and doesn’t feel like cotton. Though stated is part cotton. Fits tightly, and hugs every curve I don’t want it to, and it is stretchy."
1.0,Did not fit runs very small cheap
1.0,There bad not good don't  like  them at all
1.0,Very disappointed. Due to the groove on one of the earrings not being deep I lost an earring the first day I got them.
1.0,Looked nothing like the pic on line.  The fit was all wrong.
1.0,From the picture I thought it was a double cuff but it was an earring stud. Also I received to right ears so I can only wear one and I don't care for that at all. I'm glad it was not expensive that's the only positive thing I can say.
1.0,It looks very cheap and tacky. I am sending it back.
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger and couldn't even get past my knees!  you can see through the material also!
1.0,cheap cheap cheap!
1.0,Padding in bra made bra extremely uneven . Great colors cheaply made.

1.0,Where’s the top part????
1.0,Arrived broken and are huge. Not realistic.
1.0,They look NOTHING like the photo and truly looked like old fashioned nurse shoes!
1.0,"I was so looking forward to these as they were advertised even on TV as easy on and off.  They were even more difficult to get on than other energy socks I have.  I wish there truly was a sock that was easy to put on and off but also made your legs feel good as once energy socks are on, they feel good all day--but I dread taking them off!!"
1.0,Size fit TTS.  But unfortunately they are completely see through.  Returned them.
1.0,"I was very disappointed with this order.  The skirt is nice, but way, way too small although I ordered my usual size."
1.0,Awful product. Not as pictured looks like a cheaply made table cloth.
1.0,Carp from China.  DONT BUY!
1.0,This was a disappointment. Arrived quickly but was wayyyy to large. The sleeves are much wider than appears.
1.0,The clamp just broke when I put it on to go to work. I was so disappointed. I really wanted to wear it with a dress to work. Just like that the clamp broke while on my neck.
1.0,Runs small my normal size didn’t fit well also quality bad washed once and the elastic started to come lose and Almost like shredded elastic
1.0,"For this for my wife (after she requested it). It is not one size fits all. The package says it fits up to a size 12. This is a lie. No more like a size 8 MAXIMUM. flimsy construction, covered with threads and hair (yuck). Wrist straps on the wings are sized for a toddler. No corseting at all, just stretchy material, more of a sausage look."
1.0,Very cheap material. Not at all as advertised.
1.0,"not even close to the right size, don't waste you time or money it takes 3 to 4 weeks to arrive and then you get what looks like a child shirt. Still waiting for the charge to be remove from my account I guess it's take for the return to be process."
1.0,"Frame is cheap quality broke in a week after using it,"
1.0,"The stones are pretty, however them stem of the earing is a screw, the screw back does not screw up to the back of the earing. There is a major gap between earing in the ear lobe and the back."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:83a9b4c67142616275f2a90a510cb077]] Huge box but was just the pants inside missing pieces here. Was supposed to be 2x suits pieces not just a pants ….
1.0,All my shirts are 2x.  I wear a 2x shirt. When I put this shirt on there was 5 inches between the button and the button hole.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. Screen went out the 2nd day. Kid is very upset.
1.0,It came and I instantly knew it was too small. I attempted the shorts but they didn’t go past the bottom of my butt  and the top looks like a medium. There is no stretch to the out fit. None.  I ordered the XXXL and did not read the measurements. It was cute and figured I would give it a try. I am 5’9 and 280 pounds with a 42/44 DDD bra. It was way too small.
1.0,Absolutely not the color that is should be.  Sonic is royal blue.  This cap is light blue.
1.0,"Are they cute? yes. Will my daughter have fun putting things in them? yes. But this IS NOT an actual pop-it. She wanted actual pop-its and is disappointed.<br />They will not push in and won't stay. She has other pop its and you can push them one way, and then the other. They are very fun to mess with. These ARE NOT them. Not the same feel. Doesn't work how pop-its are supposed to work. So I guess if you want it to actually be a pop-it DO NOT GET THESE. If you don't care and you just like how cute they look then knock yourself out."
1.0,Don’t use it it leave a milky film on everything
1.0,These are probably the cheapest wings I’ve ever found. Very disappointed!! And for $30 I would expect something better than this. Picture looks great but unfortunately it’s made very cheap and looks cheesy. I wouldn’t recommend buying these.
1.0,I dislike it because it was suppose to come with a screen protector and didn’t. I don’t like the rim around it...I just like the band the face looks real cheesy
1.0,"This was a bummer, they were so cute but the part between my toes ripped out within the first few hours of my wearing them.  And I hadn't been doing anything other than walking."
1.0,It's super pretty but was packaged folded up and permanently bent like this now. I've had it for three days and it won't straighten out no matter what I do!
1.0,Already has broken.every anklet with this delicate chain breaks within a few weeks.
1.0,A cpl of these are cute but half of them are very cheap and ugly looking.
1.0,This skirt looks NOTHING like the picture. The colors are brighter and the skirt is made from a cheap cotton material. The skirt hit my ankles so it was definitely not long enough. The skirt wasn’t full at all. I was very disappointed and plan on having this skirt sent back.
1.0,Does not fit great and you can’t read what it says when it’s worn
1.0,don't buy
1.0,Seemed designed for a flat chested short waisted model.<br />Three of us tried it on.<br />Not wearable. .
1.0,Too small. To return this to you need a drop off ups label
1.0,This dress was wayyyy too small ! I wear size 18 and decided on a XXL because I did want it to be form fitting. But I literally couldnt get this over my head and arms. I debated between a XXXL and a XXL but I feel like even if I got a XXXL it wouldnt have fit....maybe it wouldve at least went over my head...I read that the dress had no stretch but it should have at least went over my body as a XXL..Im so displeased.
1.0,Bad Quality and super slow shipping. Also got the costume with a little hole in it and a scratch on hats top because of a bad package or shipping.
1.0,You get what you pay for. The zipper broke immediately and the card slots swallowed my cards instead of keeping them where they're supposed to be. My 2yr old daughter likes it as a play wallet so at least it didn't just go onto the trash.
1.0,"Fits very loosely, and the polyester fabric is not friendly to a bald scalp.  There are better cotton and jersey products out there at reasonable prices that you would better spend your money on.  Learn from my mistake, and don't waste your money."
1.0,"I have a lot to say about this jacket, not many good things if you couldn't tell by the amount of stars I gave it. Bought this as a present for my brother, assuming it was a men's jacket. It was not. And not even the correct size in women's either. True, it looks nice and has a good feel to it, but that doesn't matter if you can't even wear it."
1.0,"La calidad deja mucho que desear. Muy delgada y cuando se calienta en el cuarto se agranda y se cae. Con esto basta, nada mas que decir"
1.0,It broke as soon as I put it on😳
1.0,"I won't wear these socks, they are too bulky and tight."
1.0,"BE WARNED, this ""wallet"" is no more than two pieces of plastic that come with a loose elastic band that is supposed to hold the whole thing together.  The pieces are not attached to each other at all.  If this is the effect you are going for then I recommend saving yourself some money by getting a rubber band instead.  It would be a lot cheaper and probably work much better than this piece of garbage."
1.0,"Not very high quality, I guess you get what ya pay for!?"
1.0,zipper did not work when I received it and had to send it back. Really hoping to increase this for 5 stars when the replacement comes!
1.0,"I have received this band twice and both times it was broken. I will attach it to my Fitbit and it won't snap on. It just pulls off. It's super cute, but no good if you can't wear it."
1.0,Not like it
1.0,"Horrible tailoring! Nothing like the picture. Humans do not have square heads. Another CHINA hack going to garbage can. Also, size larger than normal."
1.0,It fits quite loosely and has already popped off several times due to the poor fit. Just got it yesterday and now the price is lower than a 2 days ago. I'm guessing that is because the quality of the band isn't exactly the best.<br />Would I order it again? No.. I think I would have to go with a different one due to the quality.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, not well made. I returned it immediately."
1.0,The socks are too small to be considered for adults.
1.0,"The material was not of good quality,  it was very thin. The dress was not flattering, it doesn't hold you in, gives no shape to the body."
1.0,Made to fit a teen girl
1.0,"I bought multiples of this scrub for work, all the same size. Unfortunately the construction is very poor. Loose threads, inconsistent sizing, and after only a few washes has shrunk considerably.  They are wayyyy too overpriced for them to be this poorly made."
1.0,This shirt is made out of stiff fabric. It is also very boxy. It does not have and tailoring as shown in the pictures. Super dissapointment.
1.0,my 3 year old has a big head and these glasses are wwwwayyy too big.
1.0,Crush not flattering poorly designed
1.0,Impossible to use
1.0,These were very poor quality leggings and we returned them right away to Kohl’s. Way to much for such a poor quality of legging.
1.0,Cheap quality and too late to return!!!
1.0,"I purchased this bag quite recently, lovely bag (purchased the red) but the straps are weak I have had to repair this bag on numerous occassions. The material used for the straps are inferior and can not take load."
1.0,This is not the pattern I recieved.
1.0,Fabric somewhat good but the neck parting messed everything up and you can’t tie a good tie like that.
1.0,"Liked it, but only lasted 8 weeks."
1.0,Doesn't work for normally pierced ears. Should be made clearer that these are for gauged ears. It hurt a lot trying to get them in!
1.0,"I suppose I expected too much at this price. I found the earrings to appear cheap, dull and without any color contrast (veins) in the stone. The seller took good care of me. No complaints there."
1.0,"It was supposed to be X large, it was like a triple X<br />also the logo was the same color as the sweatshirt it was not white as indicated in the description or picture"
1.0,I didn’t fit
1.0,Very disappointed. I got the 12-14 size for my daughter. They all said the same size. Two navy blue and one white. The blue ones didn’t fit at all which I thought was weird. The white one fit perfectly and she didn’t struggle to put them on. So I compared them and the blue ones were a lot smaller!! They came in a pack and had the same size so I don’t understand how that even happens. I don’t recommend this at all.
1.0,I like the Snap-on jewelry because of the versatility. I received it today and put it on immediately and was happy to do that within 3 hours the faux leather started entwining and pretty much just destroyed the whole effect of the bracelet. The seller had quick delivery which I appreciate but oh I wouldn't purchase this particular item because of the pleather around the bracelet
1.0,"Terrible, each one broke within 2 or 3 weeks and turned my neck green. I would NEVER gift this to anyone."
1.0,"Too big, wasn’t the size that was in the details. They looked pretty but size!! It matters in situations like this! It was for my daith piercings and they were too big!!"
1.0,This top is so ghetto. Arrives wrinkled in a plastic zip lock bag. White is completely see through. Completely. Not OK for work. Buttons are cheap and you button the top with little hair tie like elastic bands. I wouldn't think this would look great even outside of work. Spend money elsewhere.
1.0,"This is the purse I liked and I odered, however it is not the purse I received."
1.0,Giving this one star is really over rating. These are cheaply made and I had to pay twent three dollars for return shipping. Junk is the nicest thing test I can say.
1.0,"Bought this item to attach to luggage for easy time read while traveling.  Unfortunately, I was on a cruise ship when I found out it didn't work and return period had passed when trip was over."
1.0,Fabric is thin and feels inexpensive.
1.0,Did not fit as expected. Arms were looser than expected and material poor quality
1.0,"I ordered this dress once, received the wrong size. Returned and ordered again. Again, the wrong size. Both mediums."
1.0,"Fabric is not the best, follow what people post aboit ordering sizes up"
1.0,Ripped the first time it was used. Progressively worse every use. This is hands down the worst pair of gloves I ever bought for anyone. It's not inexpensiv; it's cheap!
1.0,One was broken and only 5 of the 8 came. The barbell one came loose just from sleeping with it and i went to the bathroom and it fell in the toilet 😑. The jeweled one is HUGE. Was really hoping for the horseshoe ones the most.
1.0,"The design is good but they are poorly made. The treads become loose in hours and the earring part that dangles slides up and down the chain. At times, they are not even."
1.0,Hate them the design is faded like there old and they aren't what I excpected or wanted
1.0,Item was wayyyy to small. Did not fit at all and shipping was slow
1.0,Just pulled it out of the package and one is already coming apart!! 😭<br />With my children they would be ruined in less than a month.<br />Returning.<br />So glad I checked them before giving them to my kids.<br />The strand is just from me pulling it out of the package.<br />They do look beautiful but I can’t spend $40 on something that isn’t going to last a month..
1.0,Very cheap material and way to small
1.0,"I ordered this shirt on sale. Was super excited when it arrived but sadly, it came damaged so badly, it rendered it useless and unwearable.<br />Of course, I got my refund but the shirt is now more expensive so I can't even reorder and wasn't able to get a replacement."
1.0,The item wasn t recieved.the usps probably dropped it outside.
1.0,"Size is off, not as expected. Cheap made. I do not recommend it."
1.0,Was highly disappointed in the jeans!
1.0,Ordered them twice in 2 different size and they were too small
1.0,Chain was missing. I only received earrings and pendant. Looks like I won’t be able to wear the necklace.
1.0,"I bought three sets from them all of which I felt completely unusable. Its some unknown metal painted, badly, there is no way to disguise the poor quality, you want no one looking at them closely."
1.0,ordered xl and it was so tiny. seemed like i got a xs... the pouch could barely contain 1 ball
1.0,"4 out of the 40 actually worked, very disappointed."
1.0,it is useless to me
1.0,Don't know why this is still listed on Amazon as being in stock....I tried buying this charm last week and got a message from the company saying that it wasn't in stock anymore and that they were cancelling the order.<br /><br />What's up with that?
1.0,I should have listened to the other reviewer about these glasses.  The lens is screwed into the front face of the glasses.  Who does that?!  These are cheap even for cheap glasses.
1.0,"This shirt was very disappointing I bought it in a triple XL it fits fine up top, but they must have made this for a man or a woman with no hips. I am by no means overweight I usually wear a large or a medium in shirts. I bought the biggest size because of all the reviews saying that it was small. I should have just not bothered at all :-("
1.0,"Cheap, like like a potato sack"
1.0,Fits like a t-shirt. This is definitely not a dress. Maybe a beach cover up.
1.0,"Junk. Bought to wear on beach trip. Wore the first day, nice glasses. Wore second day.... sunscreen are up nose pieces and stained my face and shirt. Then they fell off head onto sand, and broke frames."
1.0,This product is cute but way too small for an adult. This is more of a kid size. Unless you have a really small face. Bearly covered my moth and nose and was very tight.
1.0,Out of the set only ONE of them would stay on the back of my earrings. The rest kept popping off after a few minutes. I tried them with several different styles of my earrings and same thing. Huge waste of money. Great idea but please go back and correct the design/construction of these.
1.0,This dress ran really small! Buyer beware make sure you go up at least 2-3 sizes! I normally am between a 20/22 and the 4X was too small. I'm sending it back now!
1.0,very hard to tighten up around your body.
1.0,"Very thin material. Arm holes really big which I normally wouldn’t care about but they are really big.  Very short, nothing like the picture at all. Doesn’t even come close to covering my butt. Returning both, disappointed"
1.0,I am a medium size person and thought I would order the extra large because of other reviews saying it runs small.  But I was not prepared for just how small.  I can not wear it!  This must be an extra large for a child.  I wish I could give it less than one star.  Beware on these panties unless you are ordering for a child.
1.0,"Lo regrese porque no me gustó la calidad ademas de que estaba mal hecho, muy ancha la camiseta"
1.0,"Nice dresss and material, it just runs extremely small. If it didn't run so small, I would give it 5 stars. Had to return and go with another option for graduation."
1.0,Very poorly made not  worth returning so I tossed it
1.0,doesn't fit at all like the picture
1.0,"I really wanted to like this. However, the buttons at the top are very cheap looking and really only look good if its all buttoned up, which is uncomfortable. Sadly, going to be a return."
1.0,"I ordered these based on all of the positive reviews, but they’re not that great. They’re certainly not high waisted. They are stretchy and I’ll use them as period panties, but I wouldn’t order them again personally."
1.0,"My hubby ordered this for me - I really need a new extra large tote.  While the size is what I wanted, the material is so so rough - like chip a nail rough.  Shoulder straps are also not very long which means you would have to carry it down low - no flinging it over your shoulder.  So while price is low - it's a big pass for me.  We are returning it asap - and the search for a new tote for work/gym continues."
1.0,Isn’t true to size
1.0,These socks are unusually tight. Not able to wear them.
1.0,Didn't do a thing for me
1.0,It's made for a 10 year old
1.0,This purse was not what I expected
1.0,Arrived with two missing stones. The stones aren’t even in the bag that the ring came in.
1.0,It’s was too thin and big
1.0,Terrible fabric. See thru. If you have a large chest the seam at the waist does NOT stretch to fit over. I returned it.
1.0,"Didn’t like the material, it was cheap and shiny"
1.0,The dress I received is dirty. It has brown spots on the front of the dress. The neckline and armpits are dirty.
1.0,"The bottoms fit ok not great but usable. HOWEVER, the deal breaker was the top it fit Way too small! Felt more like a medium/small and they don’t make it in an XL WASTE of money!"
1.0,The jewel fell off within a few hours..
1.0,The underworld came out after only being worn twice.
1.0,I like the cut and shape of the dress but the material is very thin and sheer. It seems like a very cheaply made dress for how much it costs!
1.0,"Clips are pretty weak and the gap between the molle holds are too big, therefore it swings up and down alot and can even fall out easily. The clips also have somewhat of a gap so they dont hold on too tight when you clip it to something like a belt. Wasted my money honestly."
1.0,Not comfortable at all!
1.0,It was basically a crop top. It was not described nor pictured that way. Not happy about the deceptive pictures and description.
1.0,"the item is not the same as show. The size is good but the color is off (some brownish red) and the astro boy print is vague. Bad quality, knock off version from China."
1.0,Cheaply made and did not last more than a month!
1.0,"This is really bad, after first snow melt hat was completely wet and bill of the hat now has a big line like a dirt, do not buy it!!! 65$ goes in the trash"
1.0,The hole was cut incorrectly
1.0,"This dress is absolutely HORRIBLE! The quality is the worst. The color is not wine at all. It's more like a crayon red. The material is like a cheap satin, Superman cape... which actually goes for the color too. Its huge and billowy and not in a good way. This is like the Latina or Caribbean mom's house dress that she throws on quickly to cook and do chores but NEVER wears in public. As soon as I opened the package I new I was going to request a return. NOPE!"
1.0,The insides were very uncomfortable
1.0,NOT durable at all!! Had only used it once to carry a playstation and the zipper broke!!!! If it was used for hiking and the zipper breaks that would be horrible!!! CHEAP zippers!!!! I would like a refund!!!!!
1.0,Very cheap looking didn’t fit my fossil
1.0,It's about a third of the pictured size. May be fine for toddlers but not adults. I sent it back.
1.0,Not long enough. Thin quality
1.0,Very uncomfortable. Do not recommend
1.0,Venían defectuosas
1.0,It was coming apart when I opened the bag.  I also had to bend it into the shape of a bracelet.
1.0,So small my 10 year old wears it with her leggings
1.0,Has boobie pads that make the boobs look awkward
1.0,So disappointed I bought the black and white dress from this same vendor and absolutely loved it so I decided to buy the Blue pink and green leaf one and it is nothing like the black and white one its stiff and a weird material and the cut is completely different too!
1.0,Unfortunately for me the size was way to small. I planned to use this as a tanning suit that I wouldn't wear in public however even though I ordered a larger size to accommodate proper coverage it was still way to small to the point where it would have just been better to not wear a suit.
1.0,"The description says that it is a couple costume, so therefore I should of received 2 of them and I only received one"
1.0,The face mask fell off after just a couple of days. Cute but not durable.
1.0,Case was silver didn’t care for it
1.0,I was supposed to get 4 masks that were the same. I got 3 and some ugly man face with a cigar. Definitely would not wear that.
1.0,No corresponde a la talla
1.0,No stars! Very cheap! Was as if I took the cheapest see through sheet I could find and cut it into this shape:-(
1.0,This thing was shedding glitter all over the box before I even got it out of the bag. Didn’t bother trying it on because I didn’t want my house covered in glitter lol.
1.0,"Waist of money. The little sticky fell off the first time I put the beanie on, it was way to big, and I ended up just throwing it out because I didn't want to waist my time sending it back."
1.0,Se puso negra
1.0,"This shirt was ok the first time I wore it, but the quality is bad, and it is not going to hold up.  It wrinkles terribly, and washing it is a mistake.  It ended up with pills all over it.  I am going to have to donate it, because it is useless to me."
1.0,didn't care for them
1.0,"Had to send back.  I bought these for my granddaughter and they came in damaged.  The earring was bent, so it wouldn’t clasp.  Could had been just a freak accident, but will not take the chance."
1.0,I realize this is super cheap jewelry. But it broke on my first wearing of it. I wanted to at least get a summer from it.<br />Don’t waste the dollars.
1.0,In no universe are these sizes accurate....don't waste yiur time....
1.0,Fakeeeeee don’t buy it it’ cheap and flimsy looking looks like you got it from a gumball machine .
1.0,Doesn’t fit at all as represented in the photo. It’s not a slim fit or athletic fit shirt at all. It’s cut like a freebie shirt you’d get from charity event.
1.0,I have worn this chain MAYBE a dozen times.  It broke with a very small amount of normal wear and tear.  The product has NO return policy!  My fault for not paying more attention!!  I would not buy this unless you plan to let it sit in a jewelry box.  Will not stand up to normal wear!!
1.0,"Not for plus size, unless plus size is now size10"
1.0,CHEAP!!! I tried it on. It was too large and had many loose strings on the material. I never wore it but I missed my return window.
1.0,Necklace broke 1st day and the medallion was tiny.
1.0,A very bad design!!! This glove has very long fingers and it is loose for small hands.<br />Not recommend!
1.0,"Wore only once and the ball fell out of the earring. Not Very good quality,  but pretty."
1.0,"Got it as a present for my daughter the hoodie was too small, I would compare it to a juniors' size. When it was washed the print on the hoodie immediately started to fall off."
1.0,"Feels like the same material as my bedsheets. That in itself isn't bad, but it was perpetually wrinkled, for the short time it was wearable.  The cut was strange, as the legs have a strange corner sewn in at mid-thigh to accomplish the slouched look.  Can be seen in the videos, but these corners never allow it to sit like it does in the pictures.  Wore it once, and when I washed it, it tore.  Returning was easy though."
1.0,The material was really thin and fairly see-through. It reminded me of Forever 21 quality. It’s inexpensive but you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this dress.
1.0,Cheap and way too small
1.0,"It isn’t anything like pictured, won’t buy from that sub ever!"
1.0,I will have to return both orders of this bracelet as the clasps on both do not function properly. It seems to be a design defect.
1.0,"The clip broke the second time I wore it. Very disappointing, I actually like the watch."
1.0,"Disappointing. Too big, leather is scuffed up, all of the pieces are loose and slide around. Even for $3 this is cheaply made."
1.0,"printed both sides, unfinished."
1.0,Nunca me llego mi pedido
1.0,"Very cute prints, however they are completely see through, cheap material. Had to return them."
1.0,"These are overpriced junk, they don’t keep time out of the box and if you are like me and give it as a gift only to find out it’s junk out of the box. Save your money and buy something that has a reputation for good quality."
1.0,Its the right size
1.0,Didn’t even last two weeks without turning
1.0,Not how it looked on the picture
1.0,"In the photo, this dress looks flowey and pretty, but I'm person it's a different story.  The inner lining is very snug to the body, while the outer layer is oddly shapeless and big.  Also, the fabric of the inner lining is like a thick knit, non-stretchy t-shirt material.<br />I will say that the color was very close to that shown in the photo and it was a halter style.<br />I returned this dress and would not recommend it."
1.0,"We added batteries and it worked for a few seconds then turned off. Changed the batteries, checked the connections. Nothing. So frustrating!"
1.0,One of the worst items' i ever bought. Buyer beware.
1.0,Just makes things a shade yellow
1.0,Don't waste your money. The shoe material is so cheap and has no arch support.
1.0,Color is not the same. I bought the burgundy shirt and it’s more pink brown. Very loose fit. I’m usually a large  bought large and it hangs.
1.0,The description and picture did not match the product. I was sending back but I missed the time up send it back.
1.0,H ycugu
1.0,Junk. Weak junk.
1.0,"Size small might fit a 3 or4 yr old in length, but the width is close to my adult socks (my womens sz 9 in photo, needing whitening lol) definitely NOT going to fit a 1yr old."
1.0,It's cheaply made from China took over 2 weeks for delivery ! Feels like a dollar store shirt
1.0,"Short, see through, cheaply made.."
1.0,TOO big
1.0,Unless you weigh 90 lbs this shirt will not look like it does in the picture. I wear a true medium and I ordered an extra large and the extra large is more like a small.
1.0,Not comfortable. Cheap material.
1.0,Do not look as nice in person
1.0,My 8 yr old daughter was stoked to buy this and share with us.  The very first day with mine the engraved piece fell off and was lost somewhere. The silver is chipping on my husbands piece.<br />Total bummer.
1.0,"Exactly 2 weeks after the return window closed, the zipper broke. The coat looks nice but the quality is terrible. Save your money. This coat only lasted about 6 weeks."
1.0,"They broke after the first wear. They were a gift, very disappointed but you get what you pay for!"
1.0,I’m just not  coordinated<br />enough To be successful at using it.
1.0,Not worth the price at all. Even the tag shows through the pants.
1.0,These are more like bubble gum pink.  Not attractive at all.
1.0,It's creepy in real product
1.0,For what they cost didnt have these for that long and already broke. I would bye again
1.0,La textura de la tela no era lo esperado
1.0,this is nothing like the picture and it was suppose to be burgundy and it was bright red.
1.0,2x is like a size of a large very small
1.0,[[VIDEOID:585d907a7b4e66a9a1ede7970d98fdc5]] This is not the dress in the picture.<br />I thought I did my research by reading reviews and checking the seller ratings.<br />I don't know if it's because of the color I chose or what but it's very obvious that this is not the dress that is in the picture.<br />I don't understand why not just advertise the actual item.<br />The picture was taken and used to sell a lesser version from the seller.<br />So buy at your own risk
1.0,Arived broken and had to fix it my self. The velcro was not attached to either of the speakers.
1.0,This was at least 1 size to 2 sizes smaller than what the chart said.
1.0,Broke within a month! Piece of cr@p.<br />Don't buy!
1.0,I bought 3 of these within the past month. I found one broken and  another fell off of my arm at some point. The clasp must be faulty. V
1.0,"If you are over 5'2&#34;, there is no way you could wear this as a dress.  I'm 5'10&#34; and it didn't even reach my butt.  It's not even tunic length!<br /><br />It's decent quality for the price and the print is very cute, but it is definitely not for me."
1.0,Gorgeous<br /> I loved it and gave a great review on the look of the watch. It stopped working a couple of days past the return window!!  I checked but it was not the battery! Don't waste your money!
1.0,Neck is too wide and how it is sewn makes the collar pop out.  Seen very wrong.  I am not happy with this purchase.  The tag came off so I am unable to return.  No buying from this vendor again.
1.0,The style was what I wanted but cloth/material was too thin.
1.0,Prayer on cross is in Spanish. That was not in the description for the necklace or I wouldn't have ordered it at all. Sucks cuz it was suppose to be a gift I did not give as gift..its just laying in a drawer.
1.0,"I got both colors and love them, will post again to see how they hold up! Here I am later only holds up for one night! Cute for sure but buyer beware one wear."
1.0,"I knew these would be low quality but these are ridiculous. Very, very cheaply made. Save your money."
1.0,Horrible.  Returned it the same day.
1.0,I’m 5’10” and this dress was way too short for me. The dress did not even reach my ankles. Definitely returned!
1.0,"It does not work. It worked 2 times, then stopped working."
1.0,one sock has a giant hole
1.0,Returning the item as very unhappy!!!
1.0,"Don't waste your money. Not only did the stickers come bent, which made it look awful, but they won't even stick to the ps4. What a waste. Looks terrible. Just had to throw it away."
1.0,It tarnished in no time
1.0,Straps are too wide and too loose. There’s no way to tighten them. I am returning these shoes.
1.0,Color is not gold<br />Its rose gold
1.0,It was see through and sent it back.
1.0,I thought this product cane with a sweater very disappointed!
1.0,"I am a size 4 US. I ordered a medium. I couldn’t even pull it up pass my calves. Must be meant for kids! Unfortunately, I had been away from home and couldn’t return it. Horribly disappointed in size representation. Trashing it."
1.0,"Got this dress and return it the same day. The bodice was too short does not fall all the way on torso to waist, only up to the breasts. Following the contour of the breasts it skirts down which makes it look like your 8 months pregnant. The hem on the dress I got was falling apart. Just was not sown right."
1.0,"Shirts were clearly not screen printed.  Looks like a 12 year old cut out the design from a cardboard box that didn't shield the rest of the shirt.  The &#34;Mrs.&#34; shirt had a clear white border all the way around the word, and then had white streaks on the back like it was then dragged through wet paint.  DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Do not recommend
1.0,It is very &#34;boxy&#34; and &#34;hard&#34;.
1.0,All white on cruise it was back up strap broke. When i ordered no belt.
1.0,Small<br />Really small. My daughter is 5'5 and 125 and it was tight and the sleeves were short and legs.
1.0,The earrings I got are not the ones pictures. Only the knot is wine. The strands are bright red. They are not beaded. They look like graduation tassels on earring hooks. Very cheap.
1.0,Quality is bad
1.0,"Wanted to buy a cute crop top for my husband.<br />This top, barely covered my entire breasts. Fit like a sports bra. And very see through. But when I tried to wear a bra under it,  the top didn't even cover my bra all the way.<br />Not recommended."
1.0,"Says they’re waterproof & made out of hemp. First shower I took with one on as an anklet, it literally disintegrated and fell apart in the shower. Put another on the next day & same thing happened. I’ve had real hemp jewelry that lasts years no matter how often they get wet."
1.0,I didn’t like this shirt it’s a clingy to your body
1.0,"Waist of money, it’s so low wast"
1.0,"Fits so poorly that getting a different size wouldn’t fix the issues. Across the bust/chest it fit as if it was a size smaller than what I bought. The sleeves fit as if the shirt was two sizes smaller than what I bought. The waist and tail/hem fit and flowed nicely and according to its size. What a disjointed, inconsistent mess! I’ve been buying clothes from Amazon for years and never had such a mismatched sizing issue."
1.0,"Fits awkwardly in the top, like it was made for someone with boobs attached to their neck. There is padding  sewn in that makes it fit even weirder. I'm constantly adjusting it and terrified I will pop out of it at any minute. It's obvious that it does not properly fit the female form. It's cheap material and poorly designed/executed. I have bought plenty of other cheap dresses on Amazon and none of them are anywhere near as unwearable as this thing. Oh yeah, it's also somewhat see-through. I bought this in yellow."
1.0,"Too small, leaves gaps everywhere, even on small size faces"
1.0,too thin and had a scratch
1.0,So the color is right. But it doesn’t fit flows or oversized ... and I am usually a medium (size6) 150lbs. I went up one size ... but there isn’t enough material in the mid section to have it fit similar to the one pictured.<br />One star for effort.<br />It’s a very thin material as you can see my bra when it’s on. The material is similar but not the same as the pictures item.<br /><br />In my option - pass . Annoyed I event spent money on it.
1.0,"Cut very odd, I wear an xsmall at Maurice’s and Small most other brands and the medium didn’t fit my shoulders. Looked ridiculous. I do not have broad shoulders at all."
1.0,"I was super excited to get this in the mail, and opening the package I was not dissapointed. Very cute necklace. But my VERY FIRST time trying it on and the clasp broke off! Not fixable. Don't buy. Too cheap."
1.0,The sizing is ridiculous. This is a crop top.
1.0,Horrible fabric and horrible shape. This dress looks nothing like the picture and it wasnt made well at all. Not worth the money!
1.0,I can't believe I ordered this 8 days ago and it still has not even shipped out. Waiting two weeks to get a watch is way too long. I don't even want it any more. That's why I gave it such a poor rating. Edit: now my order has been canceled.
1.0,Didn’t heat up. Sending back
1.0,"Not remotely the color pictured — it’s banana yellow. VERY thin fabric, poor quality. Runs very small. Took 14 days to arrive. Totally dissatisfied."
1.0,I wear 32 C and I got a C cup and it is way too big. Defeats the whole purpose of this bra. Can’t wear it.
1.0,Very thin! Cut really small! Waist if Money! Made cheap ! Smells bad.... DON'T BUY
1.0,"Way too small, look like they were made for children"
1.0,These are the worst mat shoes ever made! I bought them for my daughter and the started falling apart after 2weeks of use. I do NOT recommend these to anybody what so ever.
1.0,"I originally purchased a Medium and I wear a size 6 jeans. I had to return it because it was so small I couldn't pull it all the way up. I then repurchased a Large. This did pull up all the way but as soon as I put my dress on top of it, it was horrible. ALL of the seem lines you can see on the product show through the dress! The dress I was wearing was not skin tight but rather flowy and you could still see all those lines in it. Not only that but with all of the stitch seems there was a RIP! Horrible product. Returned and refunded!"
1.0,Looks like a babies  necklace . Chain was tiny and so were the stones.
1.0,"Guys, just no. Wore it, washed it, all the tassels came off all over the washing machine and everything else that was in there. Little bits of coloured string everywhere forever! don;t do it to yourself."
1.0,"Don’t like the material, feel like wearing a rain jacket."
1.0,"I've worn one of these chains for 3 weeks. the chain turned a deep black after 2 days, while the clasp is shiny as new.<br />I have purchased chains from this seller in the past, and did not have this problem."
1.0,"Turns your wrist green, do not buy"
1.0,"I ordered a XXL. I’m 6’2” and 200lbs. I’m not very big and I was unable to get the jacket over my arms. I’m not a weight lifter, I don’t exercise my upper body hardly at all, this should fit. It’s as if the manufacturer just made it longer but didn’t take any other proportional differences in to account between the different sizes."
1.0,Color looks more like solid black if that is important.
1.0,Material is too thin. Can see through the fsbric
1.0,"I had such high hopes for this shirt.... First issue is that I waited over a MONTH for it to arrive. Second, it was more PURPLE, NOT LIGHT PINK like the photo shows. Oh yeah, don't forget sheer. Third, WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL! I ordered a xxl, which states a 46&#34; chest. In reality the shirt was 41&#34;. A five inch difference? What? Needless to say, I can't use it. Had to settle for a partial refund.... Seller was nice and had good communication. But still very disappointed.."
1.0,Does not stretch. Uncomfortable.
1.0,"It is well made, good quality.  BUT it runs small.<br />I usually buy size large for swimsuit  and they fit great. THEIR LARGE IS PRETTY SMALL. Disappointed!"
1.0,No it gave me a rash!! Not recommeneded
1.0,Such odd cut. I felt like I was swimming in this
1.0,"Pretty colors and beads. However, after wearing several strands Multiple times, the elastic broke and the beads went everywhere."
1.0,Horrible Fit/Quality
1.0,Zero support for plus sized bras.
1.0,These gloves are very thin and constantly move around while on hands. They rip easily and definitely not good for using for a good period of time.
1.0,"I bought this shirt for a gift, but it came with a hole in it. Also, the design felt like a cheaply made iron on."
1.0,Did not fit into belt loops of any of my pants
1.0,"The size is not reflective of the fit, not even close."
1.0,Definitely fit very strange and the material was not comfortable either.
1.0,"Ugh, it's not very good. Not made very well and the feel of it isn't pleasant."
1.0,"I liked the glasses , they were too small for my glasses to cover up"
1.0,Not what was expected it's not real heavy duty the problem is it's thin so you have to fold it over to protect your ears then it's to tight to short this was again a thing with Amazon that looks attractive in pricing and reviews then your just stuck buying the more expensive thing anyway and loosing on all fronts expected more with wolverine brand just buy the more expensive hats waste of money not suited for Midwest winter.
1.0,Don’t do it
1.0,Zipper broke while wearing it the first day.. hard to get in and out
1.0,Incredibly small. Like doesn't even fit my arms...
1.0,Bad product  ...lose money
1.0,This dress is not worth
1.0,It was way to thin. You could see the net holding the wig at the top of the head. I was quite disappointed.
1.0,Doesn't fit around my neck. Maybe more like a child size necklace.
1.0,"This was purchased as a gift.  When the recipient showed me,  I couldn't believe it is misspelled! Instead of ""day"" it says ""dag""<br />(Look at the last word)"
1.0,"The tutu was not fluffy like pictured. It was long and straight. Also, the sleeves and hem on the shirt were not ruffled as pictured."
1.0,false advertising. the only thing that is cotton in these is the thread.<br /><br />if you bought them to dye with your kids to help deal with this crisis it wont take even festival grade dye bc it's a synthetic fiber (polyester) and not cotton at all<br /><br />I want to ship the 3 packages I bought asap and get my money back! scammers suck.
1.0,"Very cheap material and poor stitching. Not flattering when you put it on, button are cheap white ones, not as pictured"
1.0,"This is not a coat.  It is a jacket sweat shirt.  It is not wool.  It appears to be a fleecy synthetic with a cotton-type backing.  I usually wear size 1X, so I ordered sixe 3X.  This is so small it will not even close over my body and it has no type of closure, no zipper, or tie of any sort.  Of course, I knew I was taking a chance on a Chinese garment, but it looked cute and cost very little.  My advice is, do not order this!  I will have to find a much smaller person to take this off my hands."
1.0,Sublimation takes high temperature. These bags melt if you look at them wrong.<br />I’ll use them for vendor shopping bags rather than going through the hassle of returning. They are probably counting on that.
1.0,Was very small.
1.0,To small like for new born baby
1.0,Product did not last longer then a month..started to crumble where the connectors are
1.0,I listened to other reviews and ordered up a size- bad choice.. But all around it seemed like even the smaller size wouldn't have mattered bc it's too short... And I'm only 5'0 tall so I don't have that long of a torso- it's just not a flattering cut at all..
1.0,Does not fit an adult!
1.0,Bad material I won't waste the money took forever to arrive
1.0,6x it’s a 3 or a 4
1.0,It is bigger than the description and it really smells horrible. I think I will need to return it.
1.0,Very very disappointed in the quality of this item. Literally fell apart within 48 hours.
1.0,Nice soft material but too small.
1.0,Do not buy!!!  The zipper broke after 6 times using the bag.  It was only used for very light weekend trips.
1.0,XXL is a size 4.  Sizing to small. Too bad nice looking dress
1.0,This top is extremely thin.  It is a rough gauze-like fabric that you can see right through. I'm surprised since Koi scrubs are usually durable and high quality.
1.0,"My loupe isnt very heavy, but this holder can't hold the loop securely enough against my face."
1.0,I ordered this in the deep wine color and black I’m returning both! See attached picture of what the wine color really looks like.. also material is very thin and cheap I find it VERY hard to believe it was EVER sold for 60-70 like it says the original price was. The back is also a foot longer than the front. Don’t waste your money
1.0,They reallyt don't do what I expected them to do.  They only turn things yellow.  The bright lights are still coming at you when you drive.
1.0,"Really disappointed. Doesn't look like pic, looks like a 5 year old drew it."
1.0,The material is the cheap slinky kind. I absolutely hate it!
1.0,"Very disappointed. The first two pairs have gotten runs In them upon the first time putting on. I still have one to go, but not looking good. I spent a long time researching and reading reviews for the best option for ballet tights. The hole at the bottom of the tights is also too small to get the foot out and is uncomfortable for my daughter to do so. We have used other brands that worked much better. Will not buy again."
1.0,"Blueblockers have great lenses, but the frames are made out of crap that falls apart much to easily. Also the attachment clip is the worst, it cannot be properly mounted to my glasses. The lens rides about a half an inch higher than the lens in the glasses. Avoid this crap and get it from somebody else."
1.0,Broke.  When I did get them on they hurt your ears.  Will not buy or recommend
1.0,These are beautiful but didn't look good in the ear. They didn't &#34;sit&#34; right in the ear. They kept faking which made them look like a weird dangle earring. Returned
1.0,Very see through. Sizes are too small. Have to wear a undershirt and then it becomes too hot to wear in the summer time.
1.0,bigger than my travel size suitcase i hated it
1.0,The ring I received was NOTHING like the one shown on the picture.  I automatically sent it back.  I was disappointed.
1.0,These tops are small and quality it very cheap. Wrinkle easily.
1.0,It leaves green/black on your skin from the fake metal
1.0,wishwas better
1.0,"I am 6&#34;2 and could not even put on ,I have a 14 year old step son who is wearing them,yet I ordered 2X?? needless to say want buy again and that is ashame because he likes them??"
1.0,You get what you pay for. Thin material. Waist at back is higher than the front. Bought an xmall and it fit like a medium. Disappointed.
1.0,"These are way way undersized.  I bought 5 of them because of the material, which is awesome by the way, however, the sizing couldn't be more horrible.  I ordered Youth XL and these could fit a child that wears 7/8, not 14/16.  Wow, what a disappointment."
1.0,Strap broke on first wear
1.0,"The fabric is cheap and feels awful. The picture on the model looks like it would be flattering to wear, but it's boxy and cheap. The color pattern on the sleeves is a dye print, it's not woven that way. Looks terrible."
1.0,This fits like a male nike shirt. I don’t think it’s womans.
1.0,Its more like a small bathing suit top.
1.0,1. They are not shaped like this. They are different and hard to get in and out.<br />2. I wore one for three days and the gem already fell out. Save your money
1.0,"This product was a disappointment to say the least. The first band is nice and tight to my neck as it should be. But the second band is much larger and dangles which looks weird and wouldn't be considered a choker. I'll definitely be returning this item, don't waste your time."
1.0,"Huge, plus it's the exact same hat you can get in the Dollar Spot at Target for $3."
1.0,"This item I ordered two sizes larger, as specified, one, and it was so small ,ridiculous! They are definitely not true to size!"
1.0,It is very small and it smells bad
1.0,"Not a nice bag at all, i'm surprised it has so many good reviews. Its definitely not &#34;gorgeous&#34;. I really wanted a nice black handbag similar to the designer ones, i thought because this was $60+ it would be better quality. Its not, i ended up just ordering a michael kors bag from macy's though i'm not a fan of the brand the bag is exactly what i was looking for. Its sleek and the material is smooth. This bag is very rough and cheap looking and its heavy. It DOES look like a grandma bag for sure and it has a fold on the side that i cant undo. Beautiful lining on the inside thats about it. The handles dont go down either they are permanently up. Photos are next to my michael kors bag, the photos actually do the bag justice as it isnt pretty in person at all. The material looks more rough in person, photo makes it look smoother than it actually is. Not worth the money, not even worth $20. It will cheapen you and your outfit. I do NOT recommend."
1.0,Hat didnt even work when i got it and the battey compartment was torn apart.
1.0,Very very disappointed - the stone is nothing but clear glass that I can see my finger thru it when I put it on.  It does have an occlusion but the stone does not look like the picture. the description said Rainbow Moonstones are naturally mined stones that contain mineral inclusions and many small fractures which allow them to reflect a rainbow of colors. Each moonstone will have its own unique pattern of inclusions and fractures.  I like the band very much - it is very nice and dainty but the stone sucks. I just purchased my granddaughter a gold/jade ring for her 16 birthday but it's not something she can't wear everyday right now so thought this would be something she could wear to HS - but I would not even give it to her it's so bad.  Not worth the money you pay.  I would not suggest anyone buy this - and will share on my FB page too - I have 2000 &#34;friends&#34; and always share the good and the bad with them so they'll know.
1.0,"It is not stainless steel, yes they are convenient but cheaper than I thought they were. They got some blackish color and my wife had an allergic reaction after one use, my wife is not allergic to stainless steel or any metal. Sorry can't give a good rating for this."
1.0,Very small for the size I ordered bigger than me and it was still too small
1.0,3 meses después de comprado y nunca  llegó
1.0,The fabric is cheap looking! The pockets are printed on.
1.0,JEWELS FALL OUT immediately
1.0,The moment I touched this ring I knew it was NOT 925 sterling silver! I put it right back in the bag and returned it. You should not falsely advertise!
1.0,Broke on me the first time i had it on
1.0,was very pretty and loved all the gems but never fit right and the largest size fit like a small
1.0,Very poor craftmanship
1.0,"Unfortunately the seams are coming apart. To bad because I was very happy with these at first, very comfortable. But, they did not make it through the first wash, I turned them inside out and did a cold gentle cycle."
1.0,"Definitely not true to size, I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear and this was super small. I ended up giving it away cause I was unable to wear it. Very disappointed"
1.0,This shirt is not new and smells either like women’s perfume or a scented washing powder. No tags on shirt I was sent a used shirt not happy
1.0,"Do not buy!!!, Amazon shouldn’t even sell such garbage!they fell apart in 1 gentle wash"
1.0,Cute but one strap broke upon putting it on for the first time :(
1.0,I ordered this beautiful bracelet and it arrived today but I ended up getting a item so cheap I'm upset. I received  a necklace with a shoelace cored and fake pearl in the middle.  Christmas is 7 days away and if i try to order it again in hopes that I received the right item it is now going to be to late. Because it will not delivered until after the holidays.  Amazon was also no help. When I  called they did not help me one bit I'm so upset with this and will never buy again.
1.0,Cute shoes.  Only one of the squeakers worked but since I bought them as a gift my daughter didn't tell me until my granddaughter had worn them for awhile.  Would have really liked to return them.
1.0,These are huge!!! They did not fit my 6 month old ... they’re so big they just fit my 4 year old!!!! Soooo very disappointed.
1.0,"Looks better than what it was,zipper lining doesn't even attach inside"
1.0,"These look like jeans I would find at a yard sale or the salvation army. Outdated style and extremely overpriced.  If you need these jeans, save your money and hit up a thrift store."
1.0,"I would not recommend this purse.  I bought it 2 months ago, and it is already falling apart.  The two black circles on the top fell off, and the strap constantly falls off on one side.  It is not a good product."
1.0,I return  this
1.0,"The color is poor, dull. The scarf came with red and white fringe..  Not able to use this scarf"
1.0,Makes you look like a balloon!
1.0,The watch stop working after two weeks. I was so very disappointed
1.0,"The band latch was bent right out of the box , this product is junk and has no value at all."
1.0,Bent when I got them. The rubber backings that come with it fall off all the time. The bend very easily so if you get them be very careful. I don't think I will get these again.
1.0,"I got two sets of suit pins, but no playing card pins.  This was a very simple order."
1.0,"It's a really pretty bracelet just that it's a bit hard to adjust the size, I have a small wrist so I need small bracelets or the ones that can be adjusted easily 😅.. But I really love it..🤗 will wear it on my graduation day.🎓<br /><br />Update: Keeping in mind my earlier review. I honestly, really liked this bracelet. However, I wore on my graduation the big fell somewhere and the gold sheen is becoming dull and two-toned. Which is really disappointing. ☹️"
1.0,Bought this shacket for the oversized comfort feel however after washing it the jacket shrunk a size. The arms were short and it was pretty snugs
1.0,Shoes frayed and started coming apart within 1hr of being at an indoor waterpark.
1.0,This song record sound or good charge??? It suppose too so both!
1.0,"I just received the product in the mail today. As I opened it up and look at it, it didn’t look right.  As I examined it, the frame is not aligned (first picture).  As I looked closer, one side came off as shown in the second picture."
1.0,Color and base-layer are peeling up after the first light use.
1.0,These are cute but big for my daughters necks to be considered chockers.
1.0,I ordered the item in color red. Was sent a horrible rust color which was the worst color that was offered!
1.0,"Horrible quality. Very pixelated and the dimensions are off. For example; the hands were huge, the nipples were in the armpit area."
1.0,Poor quality runs small.
1.0,"This shirt had a big hole in the back!!! Poor, poor quality."
1.0,"The posts are SUPER long, and flimsy so they bend easily. I could not get the back onto the post, there also is no taper in the post like other earrings to keep the back from sliding all the way down if you could eventually get the backs on.<br />I returned these"
1.0,"Really faded looking. Photos show product sitting on top of year old Propper tiger shirt, same lighting. Product looks like it’s been sitting in the sun for 6 months. Disappointing."
1.0,Do not buy this product!!!!!! It smelled so bad I could not use it. I was so excited to get it. I tried to air it out. I put it open in the sun. I tried Febreze. It smelled like vomit. By then it was to late to return it... Money in the trash.
1.0,No stretch at all. Especially if you’re heavy up top.
1.0,"Sizes run more like Juniors size, but only due to super small cut in the armpits and cold shoulder area. It’s a very odd fit because the rest of the dress is more forgiving.  The lace on the shoulders is impossible- wont lay flat. Dress is also see through. Sadly not worth it. I had hopes to wear this for family pictures, and there’s just no way. My size XS daughter could get away with it, but we couldn’t get over the lace problem."
1.0,Was the wierdest skirt I ever saw.. I returned it.
1.0,I was putting on a Navy hat and the back pin broke off...
1.0,"Ordered 2, both broken mushrooms, a lot of glue not stuck anymore, packed in bag for shipping, smashed badly, sloppy glue job, very dissatisfied! Hat comes with wire in point of hat and you get to curl it like picture and just brown felt! Does not look like picture, very disappointed and what a waste of money"
1.0,Was not as pictured. Had to return and reorder from someone else. Pictures shows 3rd zipper bill compartment which it did not have.
1.0,Dislike the quality
1.0,The style is cute and the cut is flattering. Some stains were on the front of the shirt with a blue hue.
1.0,Runs VERY SMALL
1.0,"Ordered it 2 months ago and just now got it. People say in the comments that they're always too small, so order a large. I ordered a large because I'm always a medium and large was way to big."
1.0,sorry but cheap quality
1.0,Honestly I’ve never been this disappointed with Annie line purchase.
1.0,Thought I was purchasing a pj set.  It's just the top.  Sent it right back.
1.0,My necklace was completely broken when I received it in the mail.
1.0,To start off I  received this dress with a broken button so the dress wouldn’t be wearable and on top of that it is completely see through from the waist down and the company refused to return item
1.0,Too big for teenage boy. The elastic is falling apart and we’ve only had it a couple weeks.
1.0,It was advertised in womens but what was shipped was a childs size
1.0,Not a giving material tight and clingy!
1.0,"Complete waste of money. The belt has a thin layer of leather that is like paper .After two times wearing the belt it falls apart ,then you can see what looks like paper or some kind of compsite .Don't buy this belt"
1.0,"Loved the dress, but not true to size."
1.0,"Absolutely not the same as the picture,  different material, different pater and  different color. Fit is ok. Length was good 5’2”<br />  Overpriced thats for sure. I do not recommend just for the fact that it feels like false advertisement!"
1.0,Zippers break after just a few uses. Very poor quality. Would very much like to return for refund.
1.0,Material is to cheap.... does not look as good as its advertised... very awkward shaped
1.0,"I love high waisted leggings but these have a thin elastic band sewn in - I'm guessing to help them from riding down.  It cut into my stomach so that it bulged on top and bottom of the band - super not cute.  I returned these.  I didn't order too small - got a medium; I'm 5' 5"" and 150 lb and I wear a medium in every other brand that I have (Adidas; Jockey; Avia; Lulu Lemon; etc.)."
1.0,Esto me enviaron no el chaleco<br />Me siento estafando
1.0,"Terrible.<br /> Inside glove filling is of thin material. It is also very slippery when driving, 'but that is a feature<br />not of their concern. Overall, flimsy and not so warm. Would have returned, but threw out all tags thinking it would be good quality being North Face."
1.0,"Fits very strangely. I'm 5'3, 130 lbs, and a 34B. Ordered the medium. The top part was so loose that it kept falling off my shoulders, whereas the bottom fit tightly to the point of an almost camel tow. The sleeves are strange in that they open and flare out like a wizard's robe, which I didn't find flattering at all. I returned it."
1.0,Wore once and side seams and neck seam developed a hole. Had to throw out. So dissatisfied.
1.0,"I got a lot of compliments when I wore it, but after first time wearing it broke with no way of fixing...what a lost"
1.0,"Love the design but it’s too big and very baggy under chin. I think I have a regular sized face, never really thought of it before so maybe it’ll work for someone else.  Disappointing it took so long to arrive.  Disposable masks are just easier..."
1.0,This product was not what I expected at all. The material was cheap and itchy and the color was off then what was advertised. I purchased a white tank top that came to me appearing stained blue. Would not buy from this company again.
1.0,Pom Poms sit in an unfortunate position on your breasts!
1.0,"Poor buy! Sizes run to small, and cheap looking."
1.0,Does not look like what was advertised… For some reason it has a Star Trek symbol. I am very disappointed as this was a gift.
1.0,"Too much money for nothing specail tote, nothing extra specal about this product that makes it worth the price they are asking for.<br />its small grey box/bag with a velcro flap and a pocket. thats it. don't be fooled into anything more.<br />when i tried to return it though Amazon, Amazon provided me a preprinted slip to return it to AutoExec and when it arrived to them Auto exec called me and said you'd can't send it back directly to us you have to send it back to who you bought it though (which is Amazon who pre-printed the slip)! so round and round i go - after 9 emails back and forth with AutoExec and Amazon i gave up and i am out my money for the item, without the item and without the shipping i paid to get it and return it.<br />don't buy it."
1.0,Colors were fun and different but the shirt runs small and fabric was scratchy not soft. Returned.
1.0,I order the same exzact bracelet before Nd it was larger it was heavier and it was good quality this one was breaking the second it came out the pack also it is small enough to fit my 5 yr old
1.0,Material was not nice.  The price was not good.  It was basically the material that wasn’t good.
1.0,Definitely not good material. It’s looks like cotton/rayon super soft and light weight. It’s not. The material is shiny and hot.
1.0,Order two sizes bigger. Mine didn't fit at all.
1.0,"The fabric is like dyed sandpaper. You know, the gritty, chafing kind of cheap bedroom sheets fabric that are overly starched or overly dyed. I wouldn’t even wipe my butt with this fabric, ouch. Gaucho style/pattern was not cut well, poorly sewn and has a weird thick band on the waist that doesn’t stretch, not sure if I wear high or low on the hip. The pockets ruin the design completely, they stick out halfway no matter what you do. The waistband needs to be redesigned into a stretchy fold-over material (yoga pants)<br />THE INSEAM/LENGTH IS REALLY SHORT!! I am 5’ tall… so that is saying something. If the stupid pockets weren’t making the fabric stick out in weird spots then I would have kept them for PJs. I admit I am curvy 140 lbs, 41”hips and big bubble butt with 36” waist so maybe that’s why these didn’t work for my body style. I ordered an XL, typically wear L. This fabric is very starchy and stiff.<br />I will keep shopping for the perfect pair of gauchos somewhere else.<br /><br />These were designed for someone tall with slim build, who likes their pockets to hang out."
1.0,Súper horrible la tela 😪 decepcionó mucho
1.0,Disliked. Size shown is not true to sizes in our stores.
1.0,The shoulder Jewlry broke when I received it
1.0,"This is really pretty, but I spend most of my time trying to find it on the floor around me because it does not stay on my scarves. Too bad =/"
1.0,"Pants only reached 3/4 down my calf, despite being described as 39.5&#34; at its longest point.  I'm only average height: 5'6&#34; with an approximate 31&#34; inseam, that's not exactly statuesque.  This makes me believe that the models used here must be very short in order to achieve the long, flowing silhouette promised by the pictures.  I'm extremely disappointed and will be sending them back."
1.0,"Junk, looks nothing like the photo."
1.0,I wish I could give this product zero stars.  Very poor quality.  Nothing like the description shows online.<br />Very cheaply made.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1.0,"The band did not fit the Casio MQ-27 as stated. The band was not a good fit and kept falling apart. I would not recommend this item. Instead, just buy a new watch.  In the long run you’ll save money."
1.0,After a week of use it broke already.
1.0,My silver bracelet is turned copper... Not happy
1.0,Not Xl at all.  I had to give them to my small nephew.  They are no where near a the size advertised.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Order was missing 6 out of 7 pcs and the only piece i received was such a cheap material, it was nothing like on the picture. Big dissappointment and flaws on the material itself."
1.0,VERY VERY thin! was dented by the end of the day just from normal wear.... very disappointed
1.0,Fake hat horrible quality
1.0,Ill fitting
1.0,No support at all
1.0,"Half of these were broken right out of the package. It's a shame because the girls (10 yrs) really wanted them and were disappointed at how cheap they were made, they did not close. The crystals did change color though."
1.0,Do not buy this .. the dress keeps falling off from the shoulder and does not stay there.. I do not recommend it..
1.0,Malformation
1.0,"cheaply made , gave it to the parakeets to play with"
1.0,Too small when worn. Got larger after wearing.. very see through as well...
1.0,We did not receive any with white shroud.  All were purple
1.0,It looks really cheaply made.
1.0,"One hat looked fine. The green one had a noticeable hole near top. Not wearable. Could be poor knitting, snagged during production or moth/rodent action (yuck). They both were flimsy/thin. Worth it to buy better beanie hats elsewhere.<br /><br />Note: We were not compensated for this unbiased review and no one should be."
1.0,"Get the black one instead. This one came with a clearly visible white elastic band which creates the Empire waist, the buttons were sewn on wrong and the button loops are also highly visible WHITE that just looks ridiculous."
1.0,"I tried these a few years ago and they were really soft. I reordered recently but they’re not the same. My feet sweat so bad in these and the inside feels really plasticky. They done absorb sweat like merino, it just sits on my feet. My guess is they upped the synthetic and lowered the wool content. In terms of odor prevention, they behave like wool socks and don’t smell"
1.0,This is NOT durable. I saw all the great reviews -- but its not the case. These are flimsy and its snapped within 1 day of use.
1.0,"To small, looks like something that would fit a child.  Not anything like the picture.  Waist is completely different than what is shown, more like an underwear waist band.  Very disappointed."
1.0,It's tight
1.0,Pants were not gray but black. Logo has disappeared after one wash. Super disappointed. Waste of money.
1.0,TERRIBLE fit!
1.0,Worst shirt ever do not buy one it came in a bag so small I seriously thought it was the make up i had ordered and 2 it’s ripped and strings  hanging all over it and it’s completely see through all the way.  And the string that is supposed in the neck to tie around the neck  is ripped and shredded.  Very poorly maid I could have made it better. For cheaper
1.0,Very thin thin  fabric and it’s really poor quality made.
1.0,It’s called a cross body but there’s no strap to go across your body! And the magnet is way tooo weak to hold it in place. Only 2credit card slots. Very disappointed for the price.
1.0,Received wrong size
1.0,I got to wear this 10 times. I am not buying cheap sunglasses ever again!
1.0,They came completely scratched and ruined. So dissapointed
1.0,Doesnt clip on or stay on I tried to take off charm and put on my conch but that didnt work so I will be returning
1.0,"The belt buckle shredded the first day. The faux leather to me is like cheap vinyl. The belt looks good. The box it came in is most impressive. I suggest the company put more money into quality of faux leather and less in the presentation box. I kept the belt. After peeling away the faux leather on the buckle, there was a nice silver finish on what was underneath."
1.0,"I feel there is something on my glasses the whole time.  Maybe because my glasses a very strong, but it got me dizzy after putting these on.."
1.0,One Broke on first attempt to put them on
1.0,The item was not small enough to be right to the body. The venting in the front would not serve in really cold weather.
1.0,Says 100 percent cotton it is NOT true it feels like what Barbie clothes are made of weird plastic feel not wearable. And I have gotten items from Allergra before liked and trusted the information now I shocked that they would sell something this horrible. Thankful I only ordered one and now will not buy items from Allergra
1.0,Didn’t really fill out like the picture. I put stuffing in it for 2 days to round it out. That helped but not entirely. It still looked kinda crushed when my kid was wearing it
1.0,Looked like table cloth.  Waste line was very cheap. Cannot tuck anything in. Sent back
1.0,Nose piece hinge is a weak link and will break quickly.
1.0,"So these came with a few other order items in one box, they just had a thin plastic sleeve over the lenses that did nothing to protect them. One lense was already scratched so I returned them. They are cute but I suggest buying a different brand that comes in some kind of pouch or case so they arrive undamaged."
1.0,I love this dress. Great fit and look. You can dress it up or down. I liked it so much I bought it in red too. Great dress for a really great price!
1.0,"I was expecting pants I could wear to work, but these are yoga pants. Definitely not what I was expecting, so unfortunately I will have to return them."
1.0,"Sent for a replacement so might update...<br /><br />Shirt is super cute however, stitching is coming undone and there are extra pieces of fabric stitched into the side. Is definitely a bit tight fitting but not overly tight."
1.0,Low quality material and assembly. The lenses pop out should you accidentally drop it. I had to trash it
1.0,I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large and it is still too small you need to order 4-5 sizes bigger than you normally wear it is a waste of money I would give it zero stars but I had to at least select one I will never order from this company again
1.0,Not true to size and wayyyy too short.  I returned this.
1.0,I gave this a star because I love star wars and the picture was great but this was definitely a regular t-shirt not slim fitting or the cute feminine cut shown on the product page at all.
1.0,THESE ARE NOT A 7-8 AND THEY SURE AREN'T A WIDE!  THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF MY MOM'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT.  I AM LIVID!
1.0,"This is not what it looks like in the picture. Very cheaply made, and tacky looking."
1.0,The chain broke  same day it arrived
1.0,Cheap plastic material won’t purchase again
1.0,"The bridge on the nose is so wide the glasses fall off your nose when you look down to read.<br />If you have a big fat nose, they may work for you."
1.0,These goggles are okay for the price but they did not come with the colorful lenses shown. They came with clear lenses and black lenses
1.0,My son has worn these a few times and they already ripped.
1.0,"Disappointed in the quality of the products - after trying on multiple different areas of my Timberland boots, the chemicals seemed to be too weak.<br /><br />Normally this would not have been a problem, and I would have contacted customer service. But customer service reached out to me shortly after purchasing, and I explained my disappointment in its lack of effectiveness. It has been over one month, and still no response from them to attempt to make things right.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product."
1.0,"This shirt is really terrible quality. I'm pretty certain it's not cotton as advertised and is very poorly made. The fabric feels like very thin polyester. It also feels like it's already falling apart. The cut is all over the place so nothing looks quite right and the stitching is in all the wrong places. I'm really disappointed because I really liked the designs. I've bought shirts from other Amazon retailers that I wish had this design. I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a quality shirt with the same patterns but even though this is half the price of other shirts, it's not worth it for me because I'll never wear it."
1.0,"Only one-picture of 2. In comparison photos, and “combine these products” photos represent as two"
1.0,I ordered size up like it says to. But they were still way to small. Asked to return them. I have went back and forth with these people for a week now. They refuse to take them back because it would cost too much and take too long. Keeps offering different compensations but all I wanted was my money back. But now I'm stuck with them and they are like girls size. Not ladies. Do not waste your money.
1.0,This should be listed under maternity! It's horrible....and way too large!
1.0,Oxidized and turned skin green after just a couple of wears. Also has air bubbles on the pendent. Wish I could get my money back.
1.0,Super Disappointed it caught on my hair after wearing one day and it broke. Super cheap.
1.0,The sizing is super off on this bra. The band and cup size are off by at least one size if not 2. I have purchased several others and they fit great. The quality is not on par with other Ekouaer products.
1.0,I don't think that it was the products fault but I kept bending it to fit my finger and it broke the second day
1.0,The picture shows this to the ground it comes above my ankles. I'm 5'9 6 months pregnant. Not what I expected at all. Also weird material and weird design. Picture looks way better
1.0,"So....in the picture it looks like the shirt comes down far enough to properly cover the midsection. There is as much fabric for the chest as there is for the stomach. If you have a larger chest, like I do, this presents a problem.  It doesn't cover them on the sides, and if you want to cover ANY of your stomach, you will be showing an INDECENT amount of cleavage! I'm not shy about showing cleavage but this was so incredibly small I couldn't post a picture for this review. Either buy 3 sizes up, or skip it."
1.0,This product is crap. The screen was green and could not change it. The camer takes pictures that look like negatives.
1.0,"Zipper non functional and broken. I was so disapppinted. This dress is very high quality and absolutely gorgeous, not sure why such a cheap zipper was used. I have a ton of Bar III dresses that have nice metal zippers, never had a problem before"
1.0,Too small....  you will have to buy  two sizes  bigger  then your size. doesn't  hold anything in. if i could return  it i would.
1.0,Broke same day
1.0,This thing is so cheap. It broke the first day I bought it. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!
1.0,So disappointed.  First it is much smaller than I expected<br />but the sleeves were so short and tight that it would not be<br />possible to wear anything underneath.  Second the khaki looks like burlap and feels stiff and itchy.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,They look quite beautiful out of the package until you try and figure out how to put them on. I could not for the life of me figure out how to wear these. I was afraid that I was going to snap them in half because they are so thin. I think that if you are used to wearing something like this then you might like them but I honestly was not a fan.
1.0,I’m a 1x and I purchased a 2x thinking Better safe than sorry but what they said was a 2x was really a small or medium. I couldn’t get my arm in.
1.0,Quality is terrible. Also very small so read the description well. The largest is only 14&#34; wide. The zipper was catching when I was unpacking them and metal prongs were poking out of the zipper pull. These are being returned as I purchased a set of 3 of a different brand for only $1 more and the quality is 100x better and they are larger. So I will order more of those. I thought this set would add a nice variety of sizes but it's just not worth it.
1.0,It was amazing at first until days later it started to turn black. It was horrible !! I can't even wear it at all !!
1.0,I like the product but it came loose in a bag instead of a small box. Highly disappointed.
1.0,The package that arrive was fuchsia and NOT purple. The top was too small and the bottoms was the big!!
1.0,"Absolutely tiny!! I'm 5'6, 150 lbs, I ordered xtra large for a very roomy fit-it is super short (!) and tight. It's from china, has to be teen sizing. So disappointed."
1.0,"I bought these in red, they are Very small.  They just looked weird.  I do have more muscular legs as I am a runner but these are tiny tiny tiny."
1.0,Ordered for my flower girl. It was nowhere like the pictures. My wedding was white and navy. This dress came in mint green. But it was so easy to return.
1.0,It broke 30 days later and they wouldn’t return it
1.0,"If you are looking for leggings don’t buy these! They are cheap and thin, you can see right thru them! They would be fine if you are planning to wear them as tights. And messaging for return, responses quite rude when I asked if I would be reimbursed for return shipping! Only got 1 start cuz you are required to click one!"
1.0,This watchband did not come with the quick release option as shown.
1.0,Had them 3 months and they are on their way to the garbage!
1.0,This is a terrible product. I am ashamed that I gave one as a gift before trying. Rings don't stay on the lid and as soon as you unscrew it there is a mess of liquid.
1.0,Box was smashed. Product didn't work properly because of poor shipping
1.0,Much to big. These are not size large. The fabric is absolutely horrible! The so called crushed velour is tacky.  It was too late to return so I donated them to a church rummage sale.
1.0,Tried to save a little cash due to the most popular brand going up in price. So based on the good reviews and cheaper cost ordered 2 pair of these. Wasn’t worth it! Every time I wear them they make my knees hurt! Yes its bizarre but true. Waste of money.
1.0,Not impressed. Never took out of package. Looks really cheap. Not hey its cheap but ok cheap. Closer too claw machine or prize in a egg jewelry
1.0,"Item was the size of a 4 year old even though I ordered a large pre teen. Completely see through, no room for clothes under😡"
1.0,The holes were way too BIG!! They were double and triple the size shown in the picture. They look ridiculous!
1.0,"Not a heavy cotton, very thin -  not worth the price !"
1.0,Buyer beware. ZERO STARS.. Poor quality... not a true compression sock.  Design distorted when feet are in socks.  Ink scratches off fabric.  I should’ve known the price was to good to be true.  To much money and trouble to send back overseas.
1.0,Llegaron rotos
1.0,The pendant is nice but my daughter can not wear it. When she opened it the chain had a huge knot in it . I’ve been trying to get it out for days and have made no headway.
1.0,Doesn’t come in half sizes get a size 8 if you’re an 8 1/2 Because they sent me a nine and it’s way too big a week after wearing the boots the seal on the boot started coming up already Boots started getting wet when was
1.0,The dress was nice itself but how can one wear it without the shoulder continuesly slding off? That was the annoying part.
1.0,It's not what you see '
1.0,"Not floral as described ordered 2xl and received l which is more like a medium at best. Returning, too much money, took way too long, not floral,"
1.0,Not cozey
1.0,I usually wear a large. I got the extra large-very tight. Not loose for exercise.
1.0,"These are cute for sure, but very flimsy. The plastic is super thin. Thinner than a coin! I’m afraid that the second the kids forget and pull their zippers with the plastic and not the chain, they will break off."
1.0,Product size isn't even close. Got a mens 2xxl and it was more like medium. I belive these are child sizes?
1.0,DO NOT BUY! ( unless you want to show your who haw!)….Dress cut was terribly bad and had to donate to the local thrift store for up cycling🤷‍♀️
1.0,"Product broke on the first day of wearing it. I thought it was just the pin that came out but upon further inspection, the silicone itself broke."
1.0,"I got cheetah print ones and they’re cute BUT they’re super short and the stomach part is big enough for like 4 sizes bigger than the size I ordered. They constantly roll up my thighs and will pinch if they get bunched. They’re super thin too, I wear maternity panties right now so it’s not a huge deal but anyone who wears regular undies might not want that."
1.0,Would barely cover my butt cheeks :(
1.0,I have not wore them outside at all.  Only in my house.  Had them a week and they are torn.  Not much memory foam in those either.  Disappointing
1.0,These barrettes are tiny and half of them were smashed and broken when they arrived. They look much better online.
1.0,I am giving these earrings one star because I bought these for two little girls. My gift to them is now ruined. One arrived with both stones & the other arrived with both stones not in the earrings just floating around in a ziplock bag. I do not like the fact that these gold earrings came in a ziplock bag either. It could have been boxed and packed better. I am returning both because I needed two pairs of earrings. I don’t need one girl feeling left out and I don’t need 1 little girl crying when a stone falls out of the good pair when being worn either. These earrings couldnt survive through a delivery how are they suppose to survive on a 4 and 6 year old? These seem to be cheaply made. One out of 4 “leverbacks” doesn’t close securely it over bites. Don’t waste your time or money. What you see in the photo is how the earrings arrived I did not even take them out of the ziplock bag to check them out. My comments are based on observations. I knew right away these would have to be returned.
1.0,"This fit as expected based on other reviews and the cut is cute and it would have been a great suit, except the bottoms are completely see through. So, unless you like to show your crack on the beach or at the pool (FYI: I like a little more modesty). I would not purchase this. I will be returning this, it is not wearable."
1.0,didn't like it much
1.0,"They’re huge, the fit me. Def too large for a baby."
1.0,Picture shown in Amazon is not the same item received. Poor quality.
1.0,I ordered the 3x and this wouldn’t fit my granddaughter. Very disappointed!!!
1.0,Very disappointed! Suit is NOT a light up suit as described! Will be sending back
1.0,Came broken straight out of the box :(
1.0,MUCH smaller than the size chart indicates. Arrived just before our snorkeling trip and it's too late to return. Will be donating it.
1.0,I am sad that the outfit was completely translucent. It would have really been cute.
1.0,The white material used on pocket trim and zipper trim looks like paper. Very poor quality for the price.
1.0,They have stains all over I need to return ASAP
1.0,Don’t even waste your money. I used this for 1 week. Kept falling off my shirt and when it hit the floor this is what happened....
1.0,I don’t think they are real lucky brand
1.0,"Purchased two, both fell apart.  No recourse because 30 days had passed."
1.0,The E broke off of the clasp and I lost it.
1.0,"I was very happy when I received the caftan, it was just what I wanted. When we went to the beach and I tried to put it on....I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. It looked great on my 13 year old grand daughter who is tall and very slim."
1.0,This shirt fits so weird. It fits like I tried to sew my own shirt without a pattern. I keep tugging it this way and that way but it still feels and looks off.
1.0,"Total ripoff ***POOR QUALITY*** not only that it took almost a week to receive, it looked like they took a piece of cloth and glued it together, the edges arn't even folded and stitched down, I'm sure after your first wear it will start to shred at ether end. I cant believe someone will actually put something like this for sale or am I the fool that bought this ridiculous item."
1.0,Fits very small and only covers the very back...wish it was longer and also covered the sides a bit of the sides.
1.0,"I just received it today but children's sizes I'm 140 lbs,bust38B,waist20-30,hips 39..I ordered Size-Large &its  very very small & short..I am disappointed because I really like the style and soft  cotton denim"
1.0,"There is absolutely no leather to this bag. It is cheap, vinyl and it stinks. I hate it and am embarrassed to carry it."
1.0,The dress was too small. I need to return dress but shipping costs over $100 to ship back because it is outside of Us. Can't contact seller through the app. Can the seller please provide an address that is located in the US so I can return it please?
1.0,Has hundreds of tiny holes after wearing only a couple times.
1.0,This is nothing short of junk. I purchased it to lengthen a car 🚗 harnase for my dog who has gotten just a little too round in her middle. The clips are not compatible with the harnase and the strap is much lighter material. I would never trust this extension to hold up under the weight of the dog in a panic stop.
1.0,"too big and not really that cute, it doesnt hold a whole lot, and it gets in the way too much"
1.0,llegó dañado por mal empaque
1.0,"This is a rip off company. The fabric is shiny and cheap, like something a kids Halloween costume would be made of. Looks horribly tack. You get what you pay for"
1.0,"Wash them, I dare you!  These masks turn into a wad of wrinkles after you wash them.  If you want 3,395 layers of rough cloth, then get them (have fun trying to actually breathe though).  Huge waste of money with these."
1.0,so bad material.. dont buy it
1.0,"The arms are too tight, also this is not a cover up it's a blouse. It is made with very cheap materials. I returned the item. Its is nothing like the pictures."
1.0,Did not like quality. It looked and felt like a beauty salon smock.
1.0,"This watch was purchased on January 31, 2021 and was delivered quickly. My husband never wore it while working outside or at his job- only while doing regular daily tasks. It kept time beautifully from time of delivery until about a week ago when it began losing time. For the whole last week (Week of June 13th) it has lost more and more time until hour and minute hands barely move at all over several hours. The second hand will move. According to the Victorinox website, these watches have a battery warranty of one year, with three years of watch warranty for regular workmanship issues. The warranty is even extended to five years for watches sold by ""approved"" sellers of Victorinox swiss Army Watches. I'm troubled that I can't tell if the seller we purchased from (My Gift Shop) is an authorized seller so I don't know how that affects warranty.<br />It is a Sunday as I write this review. A few moments ago I sent a message to the seller through Amazon's website asking for help on the watch problems. I see that during regular business hours M-F they have a customer service phone number that we can call, and I will do that if the email is not answered in a couple business days. I have to say I am disappointed that seller or warranty info is not immediately available on the item page. I had to go to the seller's profile page to track down the customer phone number. I truly hope this is an easy fix with a simple resolution (like a battery problem) because until now my husband really loved the looks and functionality of his watch. I will update review as situation progresses."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money! Not at all like the photo. I was going to give it as a cover up over my granddaughter’s wedding dress, but I would be the laugh of the party! 😖"
1.0,came in directly from China. Broke instantly. This seems to be a trend with Amazon.
1.0,"When I received these glasses, my son and I checked the polarization only to find out that they aren't polarized at all. Very disappointing."
1.0,Just not as comfortable as previous ones I ordered in the past
1.0,Wayy too small.
1.0,Took forever to get here plus I thought it would be a pale yellow but it's taxi yellow and looks like a little kid necklace
1.0,Total rip-off.  Buy at your own risk!!!
1.0,"Wonderful material, good stitching, awesome color but none of the buttons line up so it looks bad when worn.  I’m having the buttons moved to see if it fixes things."
1.0,Doesn’t work v
1.0,Not like the picture at all poor quality
1.0,That dress is not bright and vibrant and doesn't look anything like the picture I order the same dress with different vendor you can tell the huge difference in color. The size fit ok
1.0,Didn't like the color the green was to dark and the meteria lwas to thin and shiny.
1.0,"Nope!  Cheap, cheap plastic feeling material and weird sizes; sorry."
1.0,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER<br />Never got items and never received reply from seller after 3 attempts to communicate.
1.0,"I began ordering this hat in 2013 and it was a smaller beanie, not for long hair or the slouch look.  A few orders in and the hats were huge, but the product number, picture or description had not changed.  Funny thing was that sometimes they'd ship the smaller hat and other times they'd ship the slouch type.<br /><br />Excellent product, but the sizing is too inconsistent."
1.0,Horrible I bought a size bigger than I normally wear for comfort it is so tight I feel like I wrapped myself in plastic wrap. (This account is in my husband's name). The shelf bra is so little it could not fit around my boobs( im a ddd). Going to return for sure better off buying the ones from Walmart.
1.0,The item shown is nothing like the product. It's a cute dress just disappointed.
1.0,"These are absolutely terrible quality pants. The material is so thin it tears at the seams where the threads are, it is cut and stitched crooked, and the dye bleeds all over everything even after several washes and won't come out of the clothes it bleeds on.<br />So, these pants of terrible quality have resulted in having to replace other items they have ruined during washing(and yes, I washed them several times with either like colors or by themselves, this should not still be a problem after months of wearing/washing). Definitely not worth the expense."
1.0,"Nice Tanks… but I ordered a 2XL and these fit a larger Small size person or a smaller Medium size person.<br /><br />They are NOWHERE in the neighborhood of a Large, much less a 2XL (muscular) person."
1.0,These were worn 1 time and broke. Lol surprise surprise... ya get what you pay for!
1.0,Cheap material. It doesn’t do anything promised- it doesn’t hide my underwear line at all and has zero tummy control.
1.0,Faded red color.  Better quality in a box of cracker jacks.
1.0,"Ordered the wrong size, but happy the return process is so easy, going to Kohl's."
1.0,It's beautiful but way too small for me.<br />Where can I return it too?<br />Thank you.
1.0,Worst ever!  Not as described
1.0,My son loved this head band but the swoosh is coming of and he’s only had a week. Come in Nike...
1.0,"I bought an XL and normally wear a medium, still skin tight. Was supposed to be free returns but now showing I have to pay to ship back to China. Very unhappy."
1.0,Too small . Won’t fit Apple Watch
1.0,the material look very cheap. Don't buy it.
1.0,Poorly made.<br />They fell apart bf I could even wear them.<br />The red bows fell off apparently they were glued on because there is glue residue where the bows should be.
1.0,Not sure the proper term but it’s like the pastie left a stain or something. There is a very visible ring around my areola from these things and it’s been WEEKS!!!!!!!!!! They are difficult to get off. I always have remove them in the shower.
1.0,"Not so good. Shrinks when wash, the top stitching comes apart leaving small holes on the hat. For a hat that was not even worn hard out camping, this is not a good hat."
1.0,"It's a good hoodie but the first time I washed it and took it out of the washing machine, a string got caught inside of it and ripped part of the hood off."
1.0,"The first little while these were great. However, the lights on one shoe stopped working before the 30 days was even up. My son was really disappointed. Great concept, poor execution. Way too expensive for the quality.. save your child the disappointment and don't buy these. The reviews don't lie. I thought maybe we'd be different since he's not rough on his stuff, but we were no exception.  Terrible birthday present."
1.0,"Ugly, giant. Over priced. Nothing like the pic"
1.0,Hate  it. It looks tacky will be returning it.
1.0,These bonnets were very poorly made the draw string was not long enough and could not even fit my four year old without leaving a mark across her forehead. I also only received 3 in my pack and not the four that to order said.
1.0,"Terrible quality. The fabric is oddly stiff. I ordered a large so it would be roomy. I’m 5’4” 125lb and it barely fits after washing. It’s short and wide. The worst part is that the seams are uneven (you can’t fold it properly - it’s crooked) and the entire logo is off center, which I didn’t notice until after washing."
1.0,First wash in a bag for delicates clothes and .......
1.0,Runs large. Maybe I have a small head. Good reason not to buy glasses on line
1.0,not recommend. Pad is too thick for hat liner or too weak glue part that not attached to hat. So I had to buy other.(tape ) ones.  This is just junk
1.0,MAAAAAAAAAAALA
1.0,I didn't receive the tie that was supposed to come with it
1.0,"Poor quality and way too small! I measure 36"" in fullest part of chest and a large barely fit me!"
1.0,"What a piece of junk!  The grommets in this belt lasted literally only hours before they popped out of it.  I mean, I realize that this belt didn't cost a lot, but good grief, I'd think longer than a couple of hours life time could be expected!"
1.0,Beware of “free returns” you get charged $10+ for returns. If you’re a half size order up.
1.0,"It was cool while it lasted, but the fiber optics broke on the 3rd wearing. I expect something this expensive to last longer. I missed the return window by one day, and the manufacturer was unwilling to repair or replace the item. It's also not washable."
1.0,This is cheaply made. Fits different from the picture. It is not as flattering as the picture. It was a soft but cheap material. I returned it. Don’t believe the description.
1.0,"Bought 2 and both broke with in 3 day, very cheaply made"
1.0,"Very pretty pieces, except the longer moon chain came broken in 5 pieces and the choker was also missing a connection. Extremely poor quality."
1.0,The metal has scratches all over it. Wanted to give it to a friend as part of a gift but I would feel embarrassed to give this looks like such poor quality.
1.0,"It's a different cut. It isn't a crop top style. The arms are cut the same exact size the whole way down?! The picture shows the lights along the edges and the actual jacket does not. It's also an off white color, not white. The controllers are in the pockets and they're different."
1.0,Item fell apart as soon as it was washed. Note: washed on delicate cycle.
1.0,"This dress is a joke. The dress is supposed to be for summer, at least it looks like a summer dress but you cannot wear it without a cami underneath which will also show up through the crochet kind of design near the chest area. If you don't wear a cami, then you are mostly going to expose too much skin. Its way long for a size small, Im 5'2"" and 112lbs."
1.0,"This product claims to have over 70 % wool material used for the socks, arrived, it feels like polyester with cotton.  Then the Chinese label description does not match the English label, the Chinese label did not state there is wool at all.  False trade description."
1.0,About as substantial as public bathroom TP and sized for a child. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Belt comes in @ 47 inches from tip to buckle - these fit probably a size 32 waist
1.0,"When I first got it I loved it. But in one week of wearing it I realized that the back of one of the earrings is missing. I don't know when did it come off or where. Looking for it also turned out a hassle since the plastic is clear and impossible to spot. So there you have it, I spent 25 dollars for nothing :("
1.0,"The reading glasses are very poor quality, both attachment end came off after a few uses. I would not recommend."
1.0,Said newborn but it’s more like 0-3 months very cute just to big for newborn
1.0,Looked more like pajama bottoms than pants. Fabric was also pajama-like.
1.0,The dress is beautiful but it lied about the size. I ordered a 4X and it look like a 2X. I can't do anything about it nor can I do anything with the dress what I can give it to someone.
1.0,"I have a pair of glasses that are green from a different company that actually work but was looking for some additional coverage in the gaps to the skin this pair would provide. Put them on and you can still see 600-860nm light. My original pair of glasses (not this brand) you cant see 637nm or 808nm light from my 1w laser. Do not buy these, they wont protect your eyes"
1.0,Appears hand made. Taper is uneven and not a true taper
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I received this coat. I ordered 2 sizes larger & it was still too small. The picture does not match the product. The coat is very poorly constructed throughout but especially apparent in that the fur lining hood has a snap enclosure but the shell has a button so there is no way to secure. I returned the product 4 weeks ago, but have yet to receive a refund."
1.0,"Did not get, i got sunscreen instead"
1.0,"great product, too bad it's art theft, didnt notice till now and im pretty disappointed!! the fit was awesome so is the quality but the artist wasn't credited :/"
1.0,On the picture is show these items being much more bigger than what I actually got
1.0,"Wouldn’t fit on my arms way too small at 187lbs I think it should have fit. But no way plus was not gonna force it. Not true to size, I really loved the look of this top in the photo. My arms aren’t even that big!"
1.0,Tassel fell off and now I only have two.
1.0,Product bent the first time it was used. I returned the item.
1.0,Material does not feel like cotton at all!
1.0,"ok so I'm 190lbs 5'2"" so I sized up from an xl to a 2xl bc I though it would fit better and i STUDIED the sizing chart and thought maybe a 2xl would be better, but i guess i should have gotten maybe a 3xl but idk... so I am returning it, sadly, but I have learned a very important lesson: if it something like this and you are plus sized in the USA, size up twice!"
1.0,La tela es muy fea
1.0,"Excited to get watch and wear! Seemed to be good value from CHINA! BOUGHT 2, ONE FOR ME ONE FOR SON! JUNK! JUNK!  NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WATER [RESISTANCE!] SEAL YOUR WATCHS PROPLY!! Atleast not to fill up with moisture from SWEAT!!! MINE AND MY SONS DO IT!!! JUNK!! MAKE REAL WATER RESISTANCE AND GET A 5!! LEAKS AT GLASS!!"
1.0,Low quality. Logo is spray painted on and is crooked.
1.0,I have been waiting for this product since June and not have received it. The seller keeps telling me that it will arrive within 5 days & what month and day are we on now?? July 13.. highly disappointed and would love my refund which seller has not responded to. I should've bought something similar to this on Etsy..
1.0,These where huge. I ordered the adult size. Sadly I won’t get to use them.
1.0,even though i hand washed the night gown the lace trimming came a part after the second hand wash
1.0,Lasted about 3 months and then then zippers fell apart. It never was able to zip up properly nor easily. The material for the zipper felt cheap to begin with.
1.0,Too small. Poor material quality.
1.0,Took the shirt out of the bag and there was some sort of fuzz and black hair in it.
1.0,My daughter ordered the navy dress. The fabric is super thin and cheap looking and the dress was too big. We will be returning it.
1.0,"Dress was too small! I wear a 10, and we literally could not lace the back up!! It was a pretty dress, just small. I paid 19.99 for original shipping and now they are demanding $24 to return it. This is horrible. It is made in China and I have no choice but to be held hostage in this situation! I feel the outrageous shipping of 19.99 to get it here should cover returns as well. I will be reporting my displeasure to Amazon! Buyer Beware!!"
1.0,Ordered size 5 and it measures as a size 6 or 7.
1.0,Small and cheap material
1.0,I liked the shirt but it came with a hole by the armpit. So eventhough I bought a new shirt I have to sew up a hole smh
1.0,junk hands feel off
1.0,They misspelled the name. It took over a month to be delivered and the headband had no stretch to it. My daughter bought this for a teammate as a birthday gift and it wouldn't stretch enough to go around her head. The girl is 9!
1.0,This ring turned my finger green and the diamond fell out and I haven't even had it a month. Said it was Sterling silver... Obviously it is not.
1.0,These are the weirdest looking glasses I’ve ever seen. Like from a Japanese cartoon. And made worse than what you’d buy at the dollar store.
1.0,"Shorts are very small, I have never had anything at 32 that didn’t fit, these are extremely small."
1.0,Cheap do not buy
1.0,These sunglasses were on the Amazon page for &#34; fit over&#34; sunglasses.... They are not fit overs. I will be sending them back.
1.0,You have to be a trapeze artist to get into this bra. I gave it away. Disappointed.
1.0,This is not the same band I received the band I got was the right color but identical to the bands that came with the watch not what is in pics.
1.0,"They’re nicely made and I love them except the flare in the back is too big, I can’t put them in without feeling like I’m going to tear my lobe so I can’t wear them."
1.0,Purchased this sweater and the &#34;MONSTA&#34; on the sleeves are two different shades of red.  One is a bright red and the other is extremely faded.  Looks ridiculous.  Horrible quality!
1.0,wore this one time and it ripped in the seams.  Very small for  the size I bought.  The length was perfect
1.0,This item was child sized. Ended up throwing it away.
1.0,"Runs super small, and stinks terribly. I've washed it 3 times and it still stinks. It doesn't matter, it's too small anyway and will have to be donated to goodwill or somewhere. I bought a large, and normally wear a small."
1.0,It’s very fragile and broke a couple of days after. Was really dissappointed coz it’s pretty
1.0,WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL!
1.0,These aren't very well made and smaller than I thought they would be.  Arms are crooked.  Waited too long to send them back. :(
1.0,The shorts are comfortable but the blazer runs big. It was very wrinkled out of the bag and very difficult to keep from wrinkling. Very disappointing quality and fit.
1.0,not at all worth the 40 i paid  just an iron on logo
1.0,"Cheap chinese knockoff. Don't buy. Tired of all the crap on Amazon that looks fine in pictures but get it shipped and find out the truth. Too much chinese made crap just taking our money and making Bezos richer. Shop local, support your local community or one day there may not be a choice."
1.0,The stems were too short to fit my fit bit 2. The band would not stay connected to the watch.
1.0,I have small wrist and these bracelets were even to small for me to wear.  I do not recommend purchasing at all.
1.0,"Material is not jersey as it states in the product description. The material is a cheap, stretchy, shiny synthetic material very similar to children's halloween costumes. Wearing this as a costume is the only way it might be acceptable."
1.0,"Update 07/14/2016<br />Wallet has broken completely in two and it's going in the trash.  I bought it mid April and it's now mid July so it lasted 3 months.<br /><br />I purchased the HDE wallet with the lady bugs and got compliments on it the very first day I used it!  A woman at the store asked where I got it and I said &#34;Amazon! You can get anything on Amazon LOL&#34;<br /><br />The wallet is small and is the perfect size to hold your license, credit cards, debit cards, insurance cards and membership cards.  It has a plastic closure and I believe it has a metal outer case.  Whether or not it is truly RFID blocking, I have no way to tell.  I don't really worry about that sort of thing anyway, thieves can't steal what's not there! (I rarely keep money in my bank account).  I got this solely because it was cute and needed something to hold my license and my Starbucks card.<br /><br />The inside part that holds the cards is made of plastic and is already starting to come undone so I'll have to be a little extra careful with it to ensure that it lasts for a long time.  I think I can add some extra glue to make sure it stays put.  I really like it a lot so I want it to last as long as possible!<br /><br />*I received a sample of the RFID Blocking Wallet for free in exchange for my honest review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising"
1.0,"In the picture it looks like the dress hits just above knee but it was more of a mini dress on my. I am close to 6ft though the other dresses I ordered fit as expected. Also, the material smelled awful and made my skin feel yucky."
1.0,Doesn't fit at all like the site says... i couldn't even get them on...😕😕😕 A waste of money!!
1.0,Very cheap way to small
1.0,"Date wheel always stops in the middle of the date change, the watch arrived like this and now I go to return it and the return period has ended. SMH. Save a little more money and get a Seiko alternative  or a Tissot PRX instead."
1.0,"Not at all what I expected from the picture or the reviews. The material is like a costume you'd buy for Halloween, very cheap. They don't even come up all the way to my natural waist. They fit awkwardly in the crotch. I tried to wear them under a long sweater, so no one could see the awkward fit, but the seam was poky, and stabbed me in the ass all day, very uncomfortable. Worst product I've bought online before. Would not recommend!"
1.0,Laces are too short to lace through all the holes of a standard workout shoe. Bought “lock laces” afterwards. Money well spent.
1.0,"I hate writing negative reviews but I am so disappointed in these. First off they look just as pictured, but only came with one back magnet. They do however stay IF you can get one on! They are so tiny you can't get a good grip on one. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"I bought 3 blouses all in 3xl.  The rose color was sent damaged. The white one was cut smaller. The black one fits perfectly but I'm top heavy and wish I had a little more room to move. So I debated on keeping the black one but opted to return them all. So sad, I really thought they were pretty blouses."
1.0,"Smaller than expected, ordered 4T.  Will need to wear with leggings.  Also the dress was delivered today.  I always wash before allowing my kids to wear, and when I pulled it out of the washer, it had already lost 2 flowers.  Poorly put together.  I’d return it if my toddler wasn’t so excited about it’s arrival.  Disappointed for sure."
1.0,This necklace is supposed to withstand anything and it supposed to be damn near indestructible and yet when I was wearing it I was just laying down and all of a sudden it just popped off the clasp broke
1.0,"Horrible, cheap! Don't waste you money!"
1.0,"These run insanely small. I ordered the largest size for my daughter and it looked like it could fit a 5 year old, not 11-12 like the size advertised. Extremely disappointed!"
1.0,The material is very cheap looking. I will have my 3 yo wear it around the house just because I don't want to go thru the hassle of returning. But I will not reccomend it at all.
1.0,The post weren't attached to studs when received. When I went to attach the post stud broke. Extremely weak. Not happy but too much of a hassle to return them. Too bad I would have loved them otherwise. Totally useless now. I understand now why the posts weren't on studs of the earring.  :(
1.0,Water leaked in while I was showering
1.0,Too bulky. I retuned it. I would have had to size it to fit my wrist.
1.0,"Way too small.  I bought a size up, and it was still at least one size too small.  I returned it."
1.0,"Dress was a very nice color and was very soft. However, if you are short (I'm 5'7), this dress would fit quite well. In my case, the length was way too short."
1.0,Dont order these unless you have massive fore arms.  I put these on and they litterally slide off my hands if i dont have my hangs spread out. I would return these if i could.
1.0,I was disappointed with my orders
1.0,It's a stretchy material and it's still small
1.0,"NOT a compression tank top, there regular runner tank tops...."
1.0,I love the fit of the dress but it ca did not hold up past one wear. The fabric pulled away at the seams down the back and in two different places along the stitching
1.0,This product is considerably small for an XL and the material is of poor quality! I will never buy this product or from this seller again!
1.0,There are NO lights on this jacket!! Despite the tags that clearly advertise lights and a battery pack it is completely FALSE!<br />Amazon should drop this company for false advertising!  It’s not worth $50 even if it had lights but would have been fun for a party if it had lights. Returning immediately!
1.0,Necklace arrived out of packaging and with the clasp damaged it appears they tried to repair the claps and just twisted it shut.
1.0,"I donated it after trying to wear it several times.  I'm typically not that sensitive, but this really bothered me."
1.0,I wore it out just 1 evening. By the time I got home my toes were coming through on 1 sock.<br />Embarrassing!
1.0,"I ordered the red one and it did nothing for me, I returned it."
1.0,"This came without the tube, therefore it is worthless."
1.0,These pants flare weirdly at the ankles ... I returned them
1.0,"Cheap, broke before I could even try them on. Complete waste of money."
1.0,They don’t stay on feet. Wide slides and no support
1.0,"Got this one for myself, but the strap is rather short - I ended giving it to my 11 year old.  Update after just two uses - she had it on her shoulder a second time with a light Fender Squire, and the leather end tore right through.  Cheap leather ends with rough stitching couldn't bear the weight of a light guitar, with a kid basically standing still.  A hard pass on every buying these again."
1.0,These are garbage for anything but a stage prop or statue . Would not recommend for motorcycles or driving anything . Plastic and blurry . I was mad soon As I opened it
1.0,"This is dress is so weird.  Very cute in the fake news photos, but it literally has fleece on the inside of the fabric.  So, if you are looking for a party dress in the winter time, you found the right item!  I'm planning on going someplace warm and tropical so I would be so hot...not like oh look,  she's so hottt!!  More like, I'm sweating from overheat exhaustion!!<br /><br />I am 5'6, 220, (I workout so I'm solid), wear size 14/lg 16/xlg in most clothes and brands.  This dress looks like a size 8/10, like a medium, so if you are in the 160-180 range, the lg or xlg would be good.  I know because that was my former size a few years ago.  And after reading the description, that's exactly what the sizes say.  The xlg is really a 10-12.  Honestly, I was going by the reviews fingers crossed it would work.  Fail.<br /><br />I am completely disappointed in the fabric.  It is super soft, some stretch, cotton/polyester blend...WITH FLEECE on the inside.  If you ever purchased leggings from like TJ Maxx or Marshall's in the fall/winter months, they sell those slightly heaver leggings with fleece on the inside layer, so they're a bit warmer than regular leggings but not quite as stretchy...exact same thing here.<br /><br />Returning immediately.  And way too short.  If you have hips and a booty, forget it.  It will not cover your butt.  This is a dress for women sizes 4-12.  No larger.  Don't even say to yourself, oh it will stretch because it will not."
1.0,"The capsules won't seat in the machine.  They just drop through to the waste chamber.  Not eligible for return, so we wasted $45.  Don't buy from Amazon.  Get these traditional style pods from Nespresso directly."
1.0,Wasnt very happy with the material
1.0,This hoodie did not fit like it should have. I have been wearing XX shirts for about 10 years.. THIS WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE
1.0,The person didn't like it at all.
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my wife. Thought midnight was black... picture was black... purse was blue! Got stuck with having to buy her another purse. Wife won... coach won. I’m out another $200!
1.0,"Poorly made, section that attaches to watch face broke within 2 months of purchase.  Would not recommend."
1.0,Perfect quality and price!
1.0,My circuit board is non existent
1.0,Makes glare considerably worse. False advertising.
1.0,This was worthless. You couldn’t even use it
1.0,Cracked the second time wearing them.
1.0,Horrible clip.. bites the skin and slides off the bra strap.... useless...
1.0,"It was a cute dress and I thought it was a good deal, but I wore this dress one time and washed it and the hem at the waistline came unraveled and left a big whole in the middle of the back.  It is cute, but it is not worth the money to only be able to wear it one time."
1.0,This watch was terrible!  It would not maintain the time.  The slightest movement would alter the time. I would not buy again!
1.0,"Ordered this flowy cover up, received an actual suit."
1.0,Much too bulky.  Poor fit.  Returned these.
1.0,"Cheap materials, looks nothing like the picture, pattern is an orange red with yellow  plaid not at all like the picture."
1.0,"Do not buy this to lose weight, unless you plan on boxing. All you are losing is water weight."
1.0,"Even though they stated they were the both 36DDD they were 2 completely different sizes, and I mean they were off by several inches. Had to return the item."
1.0,"Suppose to be a large, but more like a small."
1.0,Sizing is off really runs small.
1.0,This was not a sweatshirt. Not even a tshirt. It was more like athletic wear material. Def not as described.
1.0,Turned and irritated my ear.
1.0,"Doesn’t stay on my shoulders, can’t just throw it on, too much work for a comfy sweater item. I’ll stick with my normal shawls."
1.0,The built in pull string made the jacket to tight
1.0,"Yes I know we have had these a while but our son put these on for the first time today, swim class starts today, and we have 2 left feet. Kind of makes them unusable!"
1.0,Minute hand stopped working after one day of use. Returning the item.
1.0,"I ordered this sweatshirt for my grandson and after reading reviews about it running small, I ordered a large. It was a little too large for him, but the sleeves were excessively long and out of proportion to the rest of the sweatshirt.  I will be sending it back and will not be interested in exchanging for a different size."
1.0,but they exceeded my expectations.  These are pretty bad.
1.0,"Came w a stain on it, didn’t try on sent right back"
1.0,"Cheap quality, checkers didn’t line up"
1.0,"En la descripción del producto decia que podia variar un poquito el color, pero es totalmente diferente, no se le ve en nada ese verde jade, es mas como un gris luna, compre esta pulsera para regalarsela a mi suegra que queria algo de jade, pero ni me atrevo a entregarsela porque pasare vergüenza."
1.0,I figured these were opaque but nope!  They're see through.  Returned.
1.0,"Its incredibly dinky. I can't even use it. I was going to give it to my 6 year old boy, but his head was to big too. My head is a medium at best (7) so I don't know what I'm going to do with his over priced dust collector yet."
1.0,This is not a sweater at all. Incredibly light fabric
1.0,I washed these pajamas and all the seams twisted. These were awful and I returned them.
1.0,VERY poorly made! Literally broke within seconds of being attached to my belt. Save your money and DO NOT buy this buckle!
1.0,Huge! It looks like a sack.
1.0,Shirt is nicely made. I ordered X Large. I take a Large US size. The shirt probably would be a small US.
1.0,"does not keep accurate time, did so for about 2 weeks and then starting losing time every day"
1.0,Too big for a child.
1.0,"The sole is separating from the shoe body already. I purchased these as indoor slippers and have only worn them on the carpet and tile floors in my house. They are clearly cheaply made. If you are looking for some slippers for the weekend, as in just ONE weekend, these might be just the right ones for you. If you expected them to last longer than a haircut, consider a different purchase."
1.0,Ridiculous glasses holder. Sticks straight out from the back of your head while wearing glasses. Does not conform to your body. Silly!!!
1.0,not for star<br />not working
1.0,Ordered an adult large and got a small that is marked as a large.  Order several sizes larger if you are ordering this.
1.0,"I wanted to love it, but it got filled with water within a month. I was careful never to press the buttons while in water. I wanted to return it but it had a short return window so it's just trash now."
1.0,"These are poorly made, and my 3 year old complains about their comfort. She said they make her feet hurt. Within 3 wears, the pink toe completely rubbed off to white. They look terrible. Invest $10 more and buy a better shoe. Waste of money w these."
1.0,Very see though not sewn well. Dont waste your money. Does not look nearly as nice as what is shown. Delivery was very quick.
1.0,"the product was of poor quality- disappointing - I sent it anyway - I doubt my sister will wear it though.  this gift classifies  as ""it's the thought that counts"""
1.0,"I can’t even put this on my body it is so ugly. It’s definitely not the comfy looking shirt you see in the picture and the picture of John looks like the printer had an error. The quality of this shirt is incredibly poor and it looks like it was made in China. Took long enough to get here, too, so it probably was. No wonder it was cheap!"
1.0,Left shoe quit working after two hours and won't charge
1.0,"very cheap stones, too light to look authentic."
1.0,"Although light weight and well fitting, the glare off the inside of the lenses is so bad I can't even wear them!"
1.0,"THIS NECKLACE IS NOT LIKE THE PICTURES!  The color is so off yellow, Cheap, it’s NOT 20” long it is 15-16” long it’s made for a 5 year old costume jewelry!<br />I WANT A REFUND!!"
1.0,"For the price I paid ,I was expecting bigger and thicker pendant ."
1.0,This sweat pants is meant for a skinny man who weighs 85lbs... not an adult
1.0,"Cut very low.  ""V"" neck open to belly button.  Returned to China and never received refund."
1.0,"No son fáciles de poner, no trae instrucciones, son muy cerrados y si los intentas abrir el material es tan malo que se parten.<br />Es una buena idea pero un mal producto."
1.0,The little drive was broken I do not want to have to buy something then turn around to our my way to drop it off somewhere or be home for UPS. When it should not come in broken
1.0,"The fabric that they use is so horrible you can see right through it! Not to mention that I'm usually a size 8, still bought a Huge size, and it was still so small. Don't even waste your time!"
1.0,"The sandals don’t quite look like the picture. The top of the shoe doesn’t stand up straight, rather it is twisted to the side due to poor construction or materials"
1.0,The ring it's self was nice. But it started turning a different color after a week of wear. I  will not waste my mom again shopping front this site. I bought several ring and earrings so far all the ring have started changing colors
1.0,"This is a cheap cheap piece of jewelry.  Very flimsy metal, and even the FAKE turquoise is terrible.  The description said that the turquoise was real, and I had my doubts due to the price, but i figured that it would at least be some type of rock, but nope.  Plastic.  The little mettle bits that hold the chain together had been bent out of place when i purchased it, they were easy to bend back into place, but i wouldn't trust them to stay in place, they'll probably break off.  It is a godly piece of costume jewelry that seems to be made for a one time use.  Other than the poor quality, it's still kind of pretty."
1.0,Shirt was way too small ordered 3XL iam a big guy with broad shoulders could not even pull past my chest fit more like a medium
1.0,Very cheaply made it's like a reusable Walmart bag
1.0,Wore this bracelet for one day and it started to come apart. Definitely don’t recommend.
1.0,"made out of bad material, took it out of the package and it almost fell apart."
1.0,so cheap and fake do not buy
1.0,Don't buy.  Didn't work at all. It's a total lie.  A total waste of money.
1.0,"either one half of thecustomers are receiving two completely different types of fabric or one half don’t know what cotton flannel really is.  Today, most quality flannel is made in Portgual and a small amount is made in the US. It is very soft and brushed on both sides. The seller advertises these products as “soft flannel”. This is a lie. It is not flannel at all. More like a cheap thin, rough fabric, liken to the rags you buy to wash your vehicle with. Not what Inwant against my body! It isn’t even pre-shrunk! I’m actually shocked that Amazon actually sells these gowns. Will return ASAP.  Do not waste your money. I suggest La Cera, for real brushed flannel."
1.0,I ordered a larger size and it’s still too small. Love the shirt but sizing is really tricky.
1.0,the glass it just made from plastic
1.0,"What a waste of money. First it arrives later then specified, and yet i was charged for faster shipping. Secondly when unwrapping the watch did not work, with some praying and determination the watch finally started working. And then thirdly the specifications clearly mentioned it to be water resistant up to 50 meters for normal swimming. Well that is what I did and guess what the watch was not water resistant. I contacted the seller and what did they say? The watch is not for swimming it is save for washing hands!!! Really??? That's just stupid. So it's a waste of money. Less than I expected of a Fossil watch for sure."
1.0,Runs about 2 sizes too small in the plus dizes.
1.0,It broke 3 days after wearing. Gave me a rash. Cheap. VERY hard to put on. DO NOT BUY THIS.
1.0,This product does not fit an iPhone 7!
1.0,Just received this product. Damaged and the chemical smell was so horrible it had to go.in the garbage. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Large is small
1.0,"Upon arrival, most of the lights were either already on and dying or not even attached to the headband. I immediately returned it."
1.0,"The description leads you to believe that these will fit an adult(hence the word “grandma”), however the ones I received are for a small child. I purchased them for my 10yr old son but the temples/arms don’t reach his ears. They barely extend past mid cheek. Disappointing!"
1.0,"Way too big even though I went by the measurements.  It said free returns (I wanted to exchange for a smaller size) And they're trying to charge me $6 to return a $10 Item, because I have no printer to print off a label. 😒"
1.0,I never wore this in water or while sweating and the gold color rubbed away after maybe 5/6 wears. Don't waste your money.
1.0,This dress is adorable but  it is so small. No way can I wear this.
1.0,"Terribly made for such a high price. The ears don't stay up- n case you were hoping for that, no. Problems with them coming apart after just the first wash, before even wearing them."
1.0,Took so long to arrive. A little tighter than expected.
1.0,I do not know why I even thought they would look nice. They look cheap and are cheap. I was embarrassed to gift them.
1.0,Unraveling within a week. Don’t waste the money
1.0,"Faulty design in belt buckle release mechanism. Happened once and I could just barely get it off, as it was tightening more and more as I tried to release the buckle.<br /><br />Happened again a second and last time and it was ridiculous as I had to beg my spouse to get the scissors and cut the belt to get it off as by this stage it was getting tighter with each attempt to release it.<br /><br />I’m really annoyed and a waste of my money, I have had similar buckles for years till the strap started to peel and this never occurred."
1.0,The waist fit great but the leg holes are way big. Its like there is no elastic in the legs and they just hang. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,"If you have a larger chest than an 32A then be prepared to order 3 sizes up. I am a 36D, 5’7”, and normally a size 8-10. I ordered this dress in a large (though it recommends a medium) because of the comments about it being too small. It barely covers anything at the top. Even with a tank top under it I don’t think it would work. Based on what I have, I would need an XXL and I’m still not sure if it would be very flattering. I’m disappointed because I was hoping to wear it for our engagement photos this coming weekend. I will be returning."
1.0,It said “6 pieces” and came with 1 hat. It’s a scam.
1.0,Was not happy with the product! As I was putting on the legging it ripped! Very disappointed!!!
1.0,Top is way larger than bottom. I had to order two different sizes to get a good fit. Not true to size. I am a 38c..
1.0,Only received the handcuffs. The badges and other stuff didn't come with it as it was noted in description. Returned.
1.0,These were SUPER cute....however the sizing is WAY off! I got an L and XL and both were way too small and I typically wear a size 8. They were also super long!
1.0,Will not fit a size 11 adult foot
1.0,Cheaply made I make jewlery and I could have done it alot better
1.0,"Tuve k devolverla pk se veia un material bien feo,no me gusto,no era lo k esperaba"
1.0,Returned. The quality is too hard to wear.
1.0,Product was sent back too small
1.0,"Not a 3XLT , it is about the size of a mens Large."
1.0,This item says stainless steel but the whole thing has turned green within a week and I hardly use it.
1.0,The fabric feels like touching a plastic bag. It's very thin. It does not have lining. I bought a size XL and my cup size is 36B and my waist is 36. My  shoulder to shoulder size is 17 inches. I'm pretty thick with broad shoulders. XL fit me pretty lose.
1.0,Fit everywhere but my bust. I will be returning.
1.0,DO NOT GET THIS ITEM!!!!!!!! The letters melt in the dryer. Super cheap material too. This item is horrible!
1.0,The split is all the way up to my tummy… my underwear shoes… material doesn’t snugs your body.
1.0,"Shirt fit perfectly until it was washed. The shrinkage is so bad. My tiny 60lb 9 year old granddaughter now has the blouse now. If you want a one time use, this is the blouse for you! Yes I followed washing instructions"
1.0,You get what you pay for.  Returned.  Looks like cheap plastic.
1.0,Poor quality! Hair was worst then carpet.
1.0,"These face covers met my expectations as far as material. However, two of the six masks differentiated in color from the ones advertised. I bought this pack because I liked the navy blue and gray masks, but the navy blue came out to be more like purple and the gray is very off as well. If you don’t mind the color, this works but if you buy this because you had the navy blue or gray In mind like me, you’ll probably end up not wearing them and end up with 4 masks instead of 6."
1.0,Not a nice jacket at all.
1.0,The color wore off after using it for a week. And I did not get it wet at all.
1.0,These do not hold up as shoe laces. Wore 1 time and they broke
1.0,wasted my money
1.0,They ripped after 3rd use. Dont like
1.0,Way too small! Unstretched it was only 20 inches. I'm a size 6 pants and around my waist this was way too tight. Not adjustable.
1.0,"I love these shoes, but I've tried wearing them twice now and they are ripping up my heal. Everytime I try to put them on they rub against my heal and I can't wear them. I thought maybe I could and now I can't return them. So!"
1.0,"Es de muy mala Calidad, se me rompió la cadena al otro día...no lo recomiendo"
1.0,Wore it once and the key broke in half. It's pretty but flimsy.
1.0,Small. Like; for a 4 year old small.  Nothing like the picture. You'll be disappointed like I was..
1.0,waste of money.  doesn't really sit up well or hold it's shape.
1.0,Not US sizing
1.0,I thought I'd like this for summer  with a light sweater to cover the spaghetti straps but the fabric was not comfortable or attractive.
1.0,Not what I thought it was. I was hoping for something with a tighter fit
1.0,"The mask itself had some strings that were coming off of it as though it we're slightly coming aparr but I thought that it was no biggie, I would just clip them off anyway.  I put the mask on, super excited, and the eyes of it are so far off that it's quite sad. The eye holes are too close to the nose and cut off at the outside corners of my eyes.  The outer lashes are tucked into the mask.  I put the mask on my 4 year old and it for her perfectly.  Definitely not made for adults and the quality is so-so."
1.0,"Returned. Adorable style, but COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!"
1.0,This should be sold as a tunic not a dress as it is too short for anyone above 5' tall to wear as a dress. also it is rather poor quality
1.0,"The second time that I wore this item, the clasp broke rendering it useless. I wouldn't suggest ordering this product."
1.0,I org gave these 5 star as I thought these would be great. Save your money. These are horribly cheap. I’ve had issues w customer service. If I could leave no stars I would. They look cute- but that’s about it.
1.0,"Definitely not as pictured. This short came so wrinkled without even wearing it, imagine washing it."
1.0,"The strap that fits in between the toes broke after only owning the sandals for about two weeks, and after only wearing them a handful of times. Also, the surface of the sandal was also starting to peel off. These are things you expect from a $4 pair of sandals but not from $35 sandals like these Cobian's. I've purchased other Cobian sandals that have held up great. Makes me wonder if I was sent a pair of knock-offs, or a pair that was made for the &#34;outlet store.&#34;"
1.0,My daughter was very disappointed...magnetic hold is VERY bad...to say the least...
1.0,cheap.  not very good
1.0,"The sweatshirt is too baggy. The sleeves aren't long enough, but the sweatshirt itself is too long. It isn't soft on the inside. It isn't a bright white like in the photo. It is a super thin fabric. It arrived incredibly wrinkled. Returning immediately."
1.0,I've used toilet paper thicker than this dress. I would never buy again. I will only wear this around the house and never outside. Don't waste your money!
1.0,This is misrepresented. The shirt came in two different colours. The neck is the colour of the pic while the chiffon is a moss green. Horrible.  The sizing is off compared to what the measurements should be. Its HUGE!!!!!  Too expensive to return from Trinidad.  BEWARE😤
1.0,Very thin and runs really small! Not a good purchase!
1.0,"was a double x and fit like a medium, not all women are beanpoles!"
1.0,"Don’t understand all the good reviews, waste on money, only got two rubber ends."
1.0,My glasses always fall off. I don’t like it
1.0,My son has only used these twice and there is already a hole at the top of the shoe.
1.0,"I'm disappointed, it says creepy clown adults men's , but only have the clothes, how is that scary? I demand a refund"
1.0,"I spent the insane amount of money to buy this and it is horrible. The ""authentic"" glove is tiny and made out of plastic(The real glove is leather and metal.. some replica) and the jason mask is even smaller(wasn't jason really big in the movie)! I was lucky enough to get a refund! Don't waste your money! MAke your own. It will be cheaper and better!!"
1.0,"This bra did not fit me for my size. The cups of the bra have no shape to them what so ever. The only positive thing about the bra is that it fit nice and snug around me so it felt secure. The cups of the bra were terrible, I'm not even going to waste my time trying to return for a bigger size cup."
1.0,Nice wallet but NOT LIKE PICTURE
1.0,"Cheap material, does not fit properly anywhere. Do not recommend."
1.0,The beads are off center. There are 6 on one side and 7 on the other. The stone is off center too. The beads make it much more noticeable. The only way I can get a refund is by sending the necklace back which will take many more days. So annoying  The beads don’t move either
1.0,They were flooding on my son was to late returning but the product looked nice.
1.0,The ones I received are silver metal and the stones are bright pink they are nice but not what I ordered I wanted the rose gold.
1.0,"I wasn’t crazy about the material, but the fit was too small as well."
1.0,It was a gift and I couldn’t bring myself to give it to the person.  The “natural” pearls look like cheap plastic balls.  Their description of this item is just plain wrong.  I feel that I have been ripped off.  Cannot return or I would.
1.0,"Unless the bag was packed with 25 pounds of stuff, it wouldn't stand up like it does in the picture. That was what I was hoping for, a bag that was stiff and firm enough. I promptly tossed this one in the donate pile."
1.0,They were very tight. There are no way to loosen them.
1.0,Doesn’t fit well at all
1.0,Too small and shorter than expected.
1.0,"not exactly as shown in the photo, soft material though but you will need a slip. Seems are OK but come undone in a few spots before even trying on, sleeves are longer than shown as well. No option to return so now I'm stuck with it."
1.0,All reviews said order up two sizes. It was like a tent. Washed it it did shrink some but definitely not iron free
1.0,"Received 2 clear, plastic, cheap cases and not the pig ones"
1.0,Picture on this is fuzzy.
1.0,"Cheap looking, shipping took forever, one earring arrived broken. The globes/balls are heavy and big, look ridiculous. They're cheap enough but completely unusable"
1.0,Horribly sized and there was no packing slip to enable me to return the item. Poor experience!
1.0,Bought a size large and it fits like a size small
1.0,"Cheap, broke first time she wore it...do not recommend at all. My daughter does not break jewelry,  she is very conscious of what she is wearing . When she was young she used to lose jewelry, that's why...product is not worth a dollar!"
1.0,"Decepcionada, no le gustó la tela, se ve de mala calidad, los colores son como desteñidos"
1.0,"This is not at all like the picture.  It is not sweatshirt material—think thin with zero stretch.  I got a large because I wanted an oversized sweatshirt, but it fits more like a medium and again, it’s not sweatshirt material."
1.0,"Literally see through, and horrible material. Looks nothing like the pictures, if you want baggy, they are not baggy there just flarred"
1.0,Nonnnnn
1.0,Horrible. I purchased 2 pairs for the beach. It was a 5 day trip and they were thrown away on day 3 because they literally fell apart.
1.0,The fabric is flimsy and more like an athletic fabric.
1.0,Sizing is way way way off. I ordered an outfit for my 18 month old and it is big enough to fit my 8 year old. So disappointed.
1.0,"When I received the product, a few of the lights were on and burned out. A few of the rubber band straps that are used to hold on finger broke easily. But the way I looked at it the grandkids played with them for about 30 minutes and loved them."
1.0,"These shoes are terrible. Very poorly made and not true to size. I ordered a 10W and the shoes I received fit more like a 9 1/2 Narrow. I can normally squeeze into a regular size 10 if I have to but I couldn't even get my toes to fit! How can they advertise them as Wide? The bottom of the shoes are very flat. I didn't measure them but I'm sure the measurements are way off. No arch support. No cushioning inside. Very odd texture. They felt like thin, flimsy cardboard coated in something. Not at all as advertised and they don't look to be the same quality as that of the photos."
1.0,"This is not true Sterling silver. The ring turned my finger green. Also, it is very flimsy. I'm sure it would have broken quickly."
1.0,Fits small in cup size even ordering bigger size
1.0,So unflattering
1.0,This is a only a black felt hat with a satin ribbon…it has no lights on it at all. Way-overpriced for a basic felt costume hat with no effect.
1.0,It's to short for your cartilage
1.0,"I bought this bag because of the good reviews and hey, can't beat the 20$ price tag. Wish I hadn't. The strap started ripping in less than two weeks of use! I had only been using it for general use, carrying around gym clothes; I wasn't putting any extra weight. Aside from this, it was a decent bag. Good size, although the zipper was too small for my preferences.<br /><br />Fortunately, they will be refunding me. The process was easy (online chat with Amazon rep) and done without a headache although there is still the inconvenience of having to return this bag and purchase another one. If you still do purchase this bag, I'd recommend sewing over the straps (where it is attached to the bag itself) as others have had this issue as well."
1.0,"You truly get what you pay for.  I ordered two of these rings and both are showing brass/copper (?) through the so-called ""sterling silver"".  I think at best this is a silvertone finish over brass.  Skip this one.  You'll be glad you did."
1.0,Get what you pay for. Ridiculous small band which was too small for my 14 year old nephew.
1.0,Returning today.  Had it less than I week a strap broke
1.0,ugly and the fabric is bad ... it's not like it looks in the photo👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
1.0,"Bought size 14 for a child who normally wears size 14, and it was way way too small.  But it didn't fit any of the smaller kids either because of the odd shape.  It is baggy in the bottom and very tight in the arms and legs."
1.0,Case is nice looking but didn't fit. Will not purchase from this vendor again since I have to pay to ship it back
1.0,Ordered a small based on Amazon recommendation. The dress was too small. The zipper does not sit flat and causes the right side of the dress to wave. The overall fit was poor.
1.0,"Just like everyone else, the ring snapped when I tried to put it on my finger."
1.0,MIT and Stanford released a study on facemasks and said they do statistically nothing and may in fact do harm. Don't be a sleepwalker.
1.0,I went by the sizing chart on 2/20/23 and ordered medium.  They were so much smaller than expected that I couldn't even get them on my hands.  Other reviews mention the gloves being too small and some say they're too big so the sizing chart is inaccurate and there is a lack of consistent manufacturing.<br />Buyer beware.
1.0,Por cuality and run too small
1.0,Does not look like it does in the pictures. Material is and looks cheap.
1.0,"After just 3 weeks of wearing these, the bottoms have holes in them. I’m not only disappointed, I’m angry. They are cheap and it’s embarrassing that I bought them as a gift for my husband. I’d like my money back. Fat chance at that."
1.0,"Horrible, does not do a dang thing. Might as well not wear a bra"
1.0,Did not work. Didn’t think I should have to change the battery that soon. B
1.0,"Right out the box, very disappointed. description says fleece lined. I was looking for something a little warmer than the average hoodie. and this hoodie, only the hood is fleece lined. The rest of it is single layer just like any basic hoodie. I'll go back to Revco/Black Stallion, its half the price for same warmth."
1.0,They were much shorter then the picture shows. I expected them to be longer.
1.0,"While the ""waistband"" was a 4x (ish) the legs were still VERY TIGHT and the material was SOOO cheap. It was a scratchy plasticky feel to it."
1.0,Colored rubbed off within 2 days of wear. Waste of money!
1.0,Please dont buy is not the cape from the picture  he send me the wrong cape i try to contact the seller and nothing!
1.0,The shirt I received was not as described. It doesn’t even have the elbow patches which is why I purchased it in the first place.
1.0,"The material was not what I expected , it was stiff and did not give me any type of room for movement. I think it would have been better if it was made out of cotton.  I would suggest to order a size up as well"
1.0,"First of all these masks are pricy ($10 each) so I expected a high quality mask. It wasn't. The mask felt cheap, especially the loops for the ears. It wasn't comfortable at all and left a large red mark on my nose after wearing it only a half hour. On top of that, the ""cooling"" aspect advertised is simply not true. During the limited (nearly immobile time) I had the mask on, it became soaked in sweat. There are much less expensive, higher quality masks out there."
1.0,"I wanted a 100% cotton nightgown and this was one of the few I found.  It fits as expected.  I was very disappointed in the quality.  It's very skimpy, the fabric looks cheap and the overall quality of the gown looks homemade.  Not sure how long it will last.  I would not order it again."
1.0,The fit was horrible I guess you have to be a model to wear this for it to look nice.
1.0,They discolor quickly and some pieces were broken when I got them. When you use them they leave like a black smear around the place you use them
1.0,Very cheap looking and does not let you return. :(
1.0,Looks good until you go swimming.  Then it turns to crap!
1.0,This thing is the biggest piece of junk ive ever seen. Like all the other reviews I could of got this at the dollar store and saved myself some money. Dont waste your money and buy this. Cant even return the thing either. I would of gave a zero star if i could.
1.0,Extremely bad came with a rip in the back and said they would give me a 25 dollar discount two months ago and haven’t gave me it
1.0,the shes arrived quickly that way there is a star. They are cheaply constructed. not worth the money. The width of the shoe was twice of my foot. donated them to the good will.
1.0,I ordered these and somehow received a light bulb?
1.0,Returned- very short
1.0,"Feel cheap ,look in no way like the photos."
1.0,Already falling apart right out of the box.
1.0,It look really cheap you can see many imperfections in just the heel alone. Never will I order from that site anymore!!
1.0,"Did not get the color I assumed I was getting. The photo shows silver and we received gold. Quality is OK,  but disappointed that the color was wrong."
1.0,They did not come straight. They were bent and then I had to fix the nose piece. I can’t wear them now since they bent and can’t be straightened back out. Worst purchase ever
1.0,I wear a size 7 so I ordered a half size up since the size 8 has been sold out for a long time and these shoes are TINY and narrow and there is no give to them at all. I was going to return them but the return date was they had to receive them back on the 29th well I didn’t even get them till the 29th so yeah thanks for the crappy experience!
1.0,This fell apart the first day..... just hours after I received it.
1.0,The chain was broke when it arrived.  Wasted my money
1.0,Way too small and is not really drifit
1.0,Inconsistent
1.0,So these were for a Christmas party and our Christmas pics. I’m not able to use these due to some of the words on the mask you can’t see bc of how it’s sewed so it looks like it’s missed spelled and 2 of the pics on the mask are very  blurry so I’m definitely not happy with this. How do I get my money back so I can find something else in time for next week. There honestly only one prefect mask and that’s the one that says Ho ho ho.
1.0,"This bra looks nice but is poorly designed. I only was able to wear it once, and the zipper first came down during my fitness class, then it was completely stuck later when I went to take the bra off. Ultimately it split from the bottom up and now the bra is useless. This was a total waste of money for me."
1.0,Bows fell off and would not go back on.
1.0,I ordered the 12m size but as soon as I opened the package I saw it was too small.  I thought they sent the wrong size.  I'm sorry to send it back because it really is a cute jacket. The red color is beautiful.  Maybe next time.
1.0,Terrible product.  The minute I took it out there were feathers every where falling out.
1.0,Product is not made very well. Placing wig on daughters head and the horn already fell off.
1.0,Glasses never arrived. The box was open and wet. The only item in the box was a tiny black pouch. NO GLASSES!
1.0,"Ordered a Large. Didn't come up past my thighs AT ALL. 155, 30 inch waist, 43 hips. NO STRETCH at all! RETURNING"
1.0,"These socks are too small for size and Not stretchable at all. Every time I wear I get painful feet and itching in feet. I missed the return window, can’t return or get a bigger size."
1.0,"The material is PAPER THIN and SEE THROUGH. These are the opposite of flattering. I was hoping to have them as lounge pants in the summer. Instead they are now pajamas that no one is allowed to see me in, except for my husband. they are very thin, so any spandex they might have don't hold anything in. These will be great for someone that is really thin.  if you have some thickness to your legs/hips/tummy, you'll will see every little ripple. Which is too bad- the lace at the bottom is pretty."
1.0,Product Fabric has nothing to do with the description eh en I place the order
1.0,"Fits my 10yr old...and I ordered a large,  I am a small/medium."
1.0,"Purchased a large, per usual. The bust is too small (I’m a 36C) and the buttons pull, the waist is flowy like pictured. The bottom of the arms are tight.<br /><br />Overall, I would not purchase again, and another size up would look like a giant potato sack."
1.0,Not worth the price for this cheap quality item.
1.0,"I purchased the correct size. Shoes were a size too small and cheaply made. This is one item Amazon could drop.<br />DONT BUY, KEEP LOOKING"
1.0,Poor quality.  It doesn’t stay put on the glasses.
1.0,Ordered this swimsuit in the beautiful light blue color.  Was super excited to get it for an upcoming vacation.  When I got my pkg I couldn't believe I received a pair of Victoria Secrets underwear from China instead 🤔 What the heck ???????
1.0,Cheap Looking and Stains easy
1.0,Opened the valentines gift bracelet and found a stone loose in the box that had fallen out. Sad
1.0,"I do have a big chest 36D, 140#, 5'5 The extra large was way too small, I could get it on, but not wearable. Unless you are a beanpol or teen girl, skip this one. The material is nice,, however unless it was drycleaned, I can't imagaine it would wash well."
1.0,"After 3 months of wearing it as a daily shoe and a few hiking trip, the bottom sole rips off so now it is not waterproof anymore.<br /><br />Stiff and firm for the first month which is nice but the material will not sustain."
1.0,If I could get the medium it would be great actually like the dress
1.0,I returned them because they were too small.
1.0,"Too big, clunky, ugly.  This would not be a problem.  The problem is that its DIFFICULT to wrap on your wrist and on my case, it SNAPPED OFF when I tried taking it off.  This watch its not convenient."
1.0,These glasses fit so unbalanced. I never wear them.
1.0,XL is really a size med.
1.0,"These slippers suck.  Poorly made, cheap, ugly, do not fit well."
1.0,"You can't seriously call this tshirt a large! It's a small or extra small. If I go by your sizing chart, this should fit."
1.0,I loved them at first then I've notice the shine was not shinning anymore so I took a look at the earrings and the paint is coming off.  Smh I hate to be swindled for 5.00. Smh I will never buy from amazon again. I feel raped.
1.0,"It would not go on my belly button, wish I paid more attention to the reviews before I bought. Hopefully I can get a refund."
1.0,Not even close to how a real septum would look. Magnets aren't strong enough to hold it together. 100% waste of money
1.0,The inside pocket zipper come off and I’ve only used it once...
1.0,It would not allow me to leave zero stars...what a peice of garbage wore it once and it fell apart..not happy
1.0,"I received a beautiful box but no bracelet, just and empty box."
1.0,I put this on and the flag came right off. I can’t even put it back on
1.0,"This item fitted too small, so I ended up returning it."
1.0,Zippers and snaps were defective.  Returned it.  Disappointed because I have bought this brand of purse before and liked them.
1.0,It’s way too small maybe Asian sizing. I have a 36 inch waist I ordered the extra-large and it’s way too small very 😣 uncomfortable and tight
1.0,"This top too small,pretty  color and style"
1.0,Loose color very quick
1.0,This is junk. It broke at the first time.
1.0,Clasp pops open and Fitbit falls out.
1.0,"It’s sad that these tights were not convertible ballet tights, they did not come with a hole in the bottom but we had to use them anyway because that’s all we had!!! They were for Cinderella!! these tights were meant for Cinderella so she could put them all up over her feet when she was wearing the Glass slipper very disappointed in this product!They were not what the picture showed they were! But we did have to use them can we still get a full refund?"
1.0,"This belt is garbage. It's made of &#34;pleather&#34; not leather, which started to crack after a couple of weeks. The buckle fell apart, and the retainer loop fell off as well. Overall, one of the worst belts I have owned."
1.0,Does not fit persona
1.0,"Very poorly made, don’t waste your money!"
1.0,Waited 2 months and recd an orange not yellow smiley face mask .  Totally hate it
1.0,Washed it once and it already has a hole in it
1.0,bought a xl and my shoulders couldnt even fit into it.. it was the sz of small shirts at walmart!!!
1.0,Read a lot of good reviews so I’m frustrated that these where so bad. If you have an any bit of a butt plus above average man hood size they fit 2 sizes smaller then ordered after washing (cold wash and medium heat dry).
1.0,"It says in the description that it fits the iPad Air, but it is about 3 inches too big on each side. It is very high quality and a nice design though."
1.0,"The shirts I recieved in the mail are in no way what I expected and they don't look like the picture AT ALL. ALSO they sent me large but I ordered medium, could've small with these but my belly would hang out and I'd look like trailer trash. It won't matter anyways because these shirts are unflattering even if they were the right size.  DO NOT ORDER OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR UNDERSHIRTS. they do not make good undershirts either."
1.0,It was way to tight for my sons arm
1.0,"Yup. They lasted about 4 hours. The strings broke on both of them, scattering beads everywhere."
1.0,Lost all elasticity after first wash. Poorly made.
1.0,"Very disappointed. I’ve been looking for matte frames. However, these were cracked at the bottom each lens right out of the box."
1.0,Very poorly made. Cheap.
1.0,Box arrived busted and sadly was way over priced. On top of that o cannot return through amazon. Very unhappy lately with some of amazons sellers.
1.0,"Delivered quickly. Very thin, one pair got a small hole in it after second washing. Disappointed."
1.0,Didnt fit at all like i expected
1.0,Not good quality I found one broke i was so sad and disappointed
1.0,No adjustable straps?!? I am 5 feet tall and this seems to be made for someone who doesn't need any adjustments. I am barely a C cup and I was spilling out of it.
1.0,"No matter what I do, it comes through the wash wrinkled"
1.0,The clasp does not open. It's not worth enough to return it but I am very disappointed in this. I will be looking elsewhere in the future.
1.0,"I don’t like these shorts  Another Cheap Chinese product & over priced. Don’t waste your money on these shorts, Trust me  I’m going to keep them as a joke for my friend 😂😂😂😂"
1.0,What a stupid ass shirt!
1.0,These are awful. Just terrible quality. No stretch so they don’t even stay on. Couldn’t have been more disappointed.
1.0,==I got glass-  R767  not these..
1.0,Nothing like the picture present !
1.0,Received the necklace and no bracelet!
1.0,"I purchased this in February 2016. It's cute. Until it starts breaking. First the zipper, then the inside of the bag started ripping. About a year later (because I wanted to keep it but couldn't use it) I decided to repurpose it so I started tearing out the entire inside lining. It was literally made of latex gloves boxes. I contacted the seller immediately with pictures and was given a refund after a year from my initial purchase. It appears the seller has since removed the listing but I wanted to put this on here in case they restock it at any point."
1.0,"Cuando llenamos el camel back este tenía un desperfecto en la manguera del agua y se vacía inmediatamente.<br />Compramos uno verde armi y el otro negro. El  negro no tenía fugas. El armi fue lo peor. Quiero una solución.<br /><br />Llegamos al paseo y cuando cargue el agua, se vació de inmediato."
1.0,Chain was broken upon receipt
1.0,Glass screen fell off within one day
1.0,"I should have listen to the reviews.  The way the ""skirt"" wraps around the waist it ends up hanging in an odd way.  I liked the fit of the top but from the waist down - it puckered and ""hung"".  I was out of town and missed the return deadline.  Bummed I'm out $31 dollars for a dress I won't wear."
1.0,"sent back, too short"
1.0,"The sizing was way off, and the bottom seam was already fraying. Terrible buy if you have curves!"
1.0,Horrible and not worth the money
1.0,was not happy with this purchase. The clasp on the necklace was broken. It would not open. I did not get to wear it for my costume.
1.0,"I'm at a loss over all these five star reviews. Granted, I tend to like quality pieces of clothing, but I also love a good bargain, which is why I don't understand all the love for this top. Lets start with the material -- its just really unpleasant. At first touch it feels soft, but when you really get a hold of it in your hands or against your skin, the combination of cotton & polyester sends chills through my body. The style is just -- how do I put this gently? -- ugly. Its not a tunic -- tunics are long and loose and look best worn with leggings or skinny jeans. Its also not what I would describe as a sweatshirt. This is an oversized pullover thats big in the body and arms but way too snug around the hips and butt to wear with leggings. Its not a turtleneck either -- its a really big cowlneck that went out in the 80s. Why mislead for the title when its properly described in the small print description? .And I've said it before, but it bears repeating -- STOP WITH THE DARNED SIDE VENTS!!! They serve no purpose, especially in a top like this, and when combined with everything else about it, just makes it one bad fitting and ugly looking top. I'm sorry -- but c'mon Amazon. Whats with all these cheap clothing styles that you're trying to pass off as quality? All these descriptions thrown into the title for what? I wouldn't pay $3 for this at a garage sale, let alone nearly $30"
1.0,This top is not very good quality. Material looks and feels cheap.  Picture looks better than actual top. Size is true to fit but that's the only positive with this top.
1.0,"If I had a NO star option, that's what I would give to these garbage luggage! I used it twice, second time only with very light stuff, BOTH trips it's handle broke before landed. Run away from this brand."
1.0,"This is an awful belt. First of all it is way too long and needs to be cut to size. I wish the company would just offer multiple sizes so this seems lazy. Also, the belt doesn't hold. So when my husband wears it, it literally loosens as he moves. Do not buy. Doesn't work."
1.0,I bought this clothing and it is too small at the top 🔝 and I wear a size medium are large the bottom part is not too bad but i bought a dress 👗 in it I hope 🙏 it fit me well this time around I don't  get it as yet I did like this clothing so much
1.0,The purse came broken but otherwise this purse is a beautiful purse! Doesn't look cheap either.
1.0,The alleged &#34;memory foam&#34; is like a high heel that doesn't compress. These are simply terrible !!!
1.0,"I used these for one winter season to walk my dog and travel to work. The wool overlay completely disintegrated on my left index and thumb (first photo). The second photo shows that the second later (black fleece?) Is also starting to break down, showing the white fabric underneath. The third photo shows that this process is starting to happen on the right glove as well. Overall they were warm, but I was hoping they would last longer than one season."
1.0,They are horrible and look horrible. They don’t stay put in any configuration. They are essentially useless.
1.0,"Do not purchase these pants. I just got them in the mail and was so excited because my boyfriend loves their joggers, and I haven't been able to find them in this style anywhere in his size. I am going to be returning them because I am 99% certain they are fake. There is no fleece lining (all other authentic ones he has purchased has it), the tags look fake (they have extra tags) and they fit like a children's small-medium. They are probably about 3 and a half feet long from the waist band to the ankle. They look and feel like cheap cargo pants. I am beyond furious and will not purchase from this seller again, and suggest you do not either."
1.0,Way too small & tight.  I wear a size 4 in most clothes. This was not what I expected.
1.0,"this item arrived and was 3 layers thick, it also has a strange fitting. its difficult to determine if the fit is upside down. the photo is misleading, i had to re-order from another company, so this was $18 wasted."
1.0,"They sent me the wrong size i needed 41mm they sent me 45mm I am in the process of sending it back i love the watch band ,I was just sent the wrong size"
1.0,"I could not get the buckle end to fit so as to install the screws.  Unfortunately, that was the end that had failed on my X40."
1.0,"The length of this dress in the picture is very deceiving.  It came almost mid-calf on me.  The model must be quite tall.  Also, the material felt strange on my skin.  Just in the time it took for me to try it on, my arms and back began to itch.  After removing the garment, I was uncomfortable for a good two hours.  I applaud this company for making clothing that is SPF rated; however, it was not for me.  Bummer."
1.0,I have been waiting on this item since APRIL... I’m very disappointed. I have NO understanding as to why it’s taking so long to receive 2 Pompom balls with a leaf attached.
1.0,"Title says cotton knit knee high socks.. There is no cotton at all in these socks! Label says 80% polyester, 15% spandex, 5% nylon!"
1.0,You get what you pay for. These are very cheap looking.
1.0,"I got this necklace has a birthday present which is pretty awesome because I just recently got into hummingbirds but it's his will stainless steel or sterling silver one of the two in the description and it's neither because it tarnished and I got a really ugly rash that I had to go get medication for and then I tried to clean it thinking well maybe it was just some kind of some kind of problem that needed to be cleaned off most jewelry has to be cleaned anyway but it turns out it's just a stainless steel or some type of coating on top of brass which is why I broke out oh, so it's a beautifully composed necklace that I can't even wear anymore but the idea and the sentiment meant a lot"
1.0,The fit & style were nice. The frame appears to be painted gold & Very tacky looking. Glasses from the dollar store look much better than these. Ordered these because the picture was pretty....
1.0,I loved the detail on the sleeves of this dress but the material is just not very nice at all.  It is this shiny strange stuff and the flowers look really cheaply put on the sleeves.  I was disappointed.
1.0,"Bought for gf, she hand wash before wearing, colors ran. She tell me I did bad : ("
1.0,"Really cute rings... not real silver. turned my finger green within 2 hour, I'm not even joking. but they are very cute rings. sad they aren't real."
1.0,"After two washes the decal started peeling off the shirt, not impressed at all. I should have just spend the extra money and got the materials and made the shirt myself it would have lasted longer! But I didn’t want to buy all the materials and do it so decided to just buy this shirt. But I’ve only washed it twice and the decal is already peeling off! Not impressed at all!"
1.0,"The print was gorgeous,  made very cheap and no detail to the body at all"
1.0,"I cannot remember when I actually purchased my Everyday Messenger Bag V1, but I can no longer use it because the material on the sling has deteriorated to the point of rubbing off on my work clothes and staining them permanently. The material connecting the hardware to the sling has also deteriorated to the point of almost ripping. Months of email messages back and forth and now the company has gone silent."
1.0,Cute as can be but did not handle three openings.  Completely fell out of the little tips.
1.0,Very cheaply made I had to return
1.0,Ordered twice both had holes.
1.0,Paid for 2 sets only got one set really not happy
1.0,Clasp doesn't stay-falls off every time you move your wrist. This was my second attempt at this band as it looks nice.
1.0,It was way to small I ordered a xl it looks like a its a medium way to small
1.0,Skirt was too big for me and I personally didn't like the way it was sewn it looked not well done. However the fabric is gorgeous. i had to return because sadly it didn't look good
1.0,"Hat came as flat as a piece of paper.  The hat has no rigidity, and materials are very cheap.  Looks nothing like the picture portrayed. The hat is worth about $5, no where near the quality of a $17 hat."
1.0,The shoe is at least 4 sizes larger than what is on the label.
1.0,I had one like this that I used for about 7 years until the plastic clips finally broke. So I ordered another. This will not stay on the door. There are 8 hooks and I hung handbags on it and both popped off door before I could even close it. I tried with just cloth and lightweight bags and still it popped off. I tried with only 6 bags and still it popped off. Just does not work.
1.0,I have had this purse not too long and the strap already broke! I thought buying a nicer purse like this would actually last me a while but nope! Snapped on me on the way home from work.
1.0,"SEE BELOW UPDATED REVIEW<br />Very cute and well put together socks. Will provide some great warmth when the weather gets a little cooler or we go up north.  Seem to give some protection to the knees for when our baby because more mobile.  Looks like they are put together nicely so should have plenty of life to them. Cute colors that can add some pop to many outfits. Only negative is all product tags are in Chinese so unable to read what the materials are, or size limits are on these socks<br /><br />UPDATE: Now that baby is a 13 lbs (not a big baby) these leggings are awful. They leave red marks/bruises on her thighs after a day of wear. Marks stay for at least a week. BUYER BEWARE<br /><br />These were purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
1.0,This item does not fit the watch well. There is huge gaps.
1.0,not worth buying
1.0,"Imagine is way to large.  It doesn’t fit your face right at all.  If the image on the mask would be maybe 25% smaller. It would look right.  Other then the huge image, the mask fit great."
1.0,"I just received my glasses. I don't need reading glasses and was only planning to use them for reducing eye strain from blue light. Received 1.75x prescription instead. Needless to say, they are being returned. But before I sent them back I wanted to check to see if they actually filter blue light. I used several online tests and the glasses failed them all."
1.0,"Garbage. I am pretty sure these were knock-offs or made horribly. My old pair from the store fit perfect and never had any issue. These ones felt cheap, tight to open, felt stretched to wear, and even squeaked on the hinge. To top it off... I've probably worn them 6 or 7 times since I've got them a month ago. Today... above both lens cracked just from opening and the lens fell out and they're ruined. What a waste of money."
1.0,"sadly the really cheap construction ruins what otherwise would be a really neat product! All I can say is that in its current incarnation do not get it, however, if the manufacturer would just put a bit more effort into the product rather than the current 2 cents worth of plastic I would love to try it again. As is, well, its a pass."
1.0,"Got the shirt in.  Definitely not what I expected & not quite what is pictured in the advertising.  I went by the size chart & ordered a Large, shirt fit like a small.  Not baggy or over the shoulder.  I’m returning it & I ordered an XXL & should be here Tuesday.  If you are ordering I would say order 2 sizes up I guess."
1.0,Product arrived damaged. Sole is not attached to shoe. See pictures. Poor quality.
1.0,La tela es de pésima calidad.
1.0,I got the two pack black but got one in size xs and one in s.
1.0,Was not pleased with this product 😡😡
1.0,"I ordered this necklace with my middle name on it.  It arrived with a totally different name (Sarah) and I unfortunately don't know anybody named Sarah to give it to.  It seems like the entire premise of this necklace is that you can get your name (or a friend's name), so getting the wrong one really speaks badly of the quality control.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a fine little jewelry piece about the level you'd expect from a mall store."
1.0,All dented up when we got
1.0,"A huge no no if you have a larger chest. This wouldn't even hold my chest for 20 seconds it slid right off. The sticky adhesive isn't that great either. I'm a D chest if that helps anyone, also when I purchased this there was a paper inside stating if I emailed them I would get a free pair of stick on chicken cutlets I never got a response for that and that was a month ago."
1.0,"Great looking shirt, but unfortunate runs a few sizes too small."
1.0,"This is a SHORT sleeve shirt, not a long sleeve as pictured and described.  I have ordered this same shirt twice and same result buth times."
1.0,Put in the washer on short gentle cycle and the sleeve came a loose from the arm. But... it was returned in time for a full refund.
1.0,"A seam ripped after a week, very thin, not warm, and the touchscreen pads arent very sensitive."
1.0,Too large order your size
1.0,"does not fit to size.  and I am having trouble getting a return for a bigger size!  I have heard that this type of jewelry from China runs small. I will not purchase from China again.  For now, I am just trying to process an exchange, and I have not heard from the seller!"
1.0,"Ordered this hoodie, arrived as a crew neck sweatshirt.  Wound up keeping it, as my kid didn't care, but definitely not as shown or described."
1.0,Do not like how thick the material is. It's very stretchy and thick. TOO HOT! Runs small.
1.0,"The material is pretty flimsy, the insole was a thin sheet of foam glued onto the sole, and the laces got holes in them within a month. Save yourself some trouble and some money by getting a better quality pair of shoes."
1.0,"Poor quality on this item, I returned."
1.0,Cute sports bra based on the picture shown but is cut too small. I believed I ordered a Medium. I returned it.
1.0,"really bad quality, the material feels and look cheap"
1.0,At the time of adjusting the legin pants it is opening in the part of the seam I consider that it should be more resistant. the quality at first glance looks good but the mesh must be stronger
1.0,Too small because we never got it!
1.0,Returned the item
1.0,"Good concept, horrible delivery"
1.0,Sent it back didn’t like the style or fit
1.0,The strap broke right away. I only had the purse a month. Very poorly made.
1.0,"Worst purchase in ages, don't do it!"
1.0,Fabric is very flimsy. Can't wear as dress. More like tunic top.
1.0,Too small and arms way too narrow for XL size.
1.0,looked bad and fit worse
1.0,Looks very nice but 1st day of use stones started falling out. I unfortunately kept forgetting to return it.
1.0,Did not like them at all they just didn’t work for me 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
1.0,I’ve gawd it for a week. Really pretty but came apart.
1.0,"It's loose fitting and the zipper broke after the 1st use, extremely disappointing."
1.0,If you 16-29 please don't get this for yourself .
1.0,Spent way too long trying to open clasp.  Ridiculous.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!<br /><br />I was shocked when I opened this dress based on the good reviews. The print was so cheap looking, nothing like the picture. I ordered a small but the dress passed my knees and the top was loose. Although it said 'free returns' I am still trying to figure out how to return this item, as it is proving to be not as simple as usual to return it compared with other prime free return items. Super disappointing.<br /><br />edit: I have been waiting for my refund for MONTHS NOW...still have not received"
1.0,I think I have a normal size head but these hung off my face and are super large in size.  Recommend if you have a large head or like big glasses. Wide across eyes.
1.0,Did not fit well at all terrible design
1.0,It’s plastic!  Looks great in picture but it’s a toy-like quality. Junk
1.0,I needed knee-high socks but only offered one size available so different heights.  I needed Knee-hi but only ended<br />up calf high.
1.0,"This shirt is of very low quality and should not cost anymore than $8. It’s not very elastic, a weird fit and the scoop neck is way too wide. I don’t recommend this at all."
1.0,Horrible product came with huge hole in it :/
1.0,Very simple for the price 😐
1.0,"Super disappointed for spending over $50 for this (including shipping). The color of the sweatshirt isn’t the same gray as shown. And the screen print looks cheap and faded, definitely not how it shows in the pic."
1.0,"After only two months....I've had to toss 2 pairs out because, the arm hinges lost screws.  All of sudden, I put the glasses on and the ear piece falls to the floor.  I'd have better luck at the dollar store. I can't even try to repair them cause I can't see the screw, I'd need my glasses  and a few hinge screws too)<br />  What a waste."
1.0,"really, really tacky.  a waste of money at any price."
1.0,"The size medium from this seller are on top of the size small leggings from NVGTN. These run extremely small. They are stretchy but, even before trying on threads were showing so loose. I am thinking about giving the size large a try but, I’m scared the threads would be loose and not last long. The price is great but, the two pairs I ordered weren’t good. The style is super cute and so close to NVGTN so hopefully they make the threads a little better"
1.0,Awful didn’t like it ! Always slips off.
1.0,"Mala calidad,no Era lo que esperaba"
1.0,Zero stars!!!! Cheap quality!smelled awful and inside lining already peeling
1.0,Not even worth the amount I paid for it had poor material and it was all crushed when I got it I want my money back !
1.0,"Extremely cheap! Horrible quality and when I tried to return it, there was never an answer."
1.0,"I expected a whole solid piece but it was put together with ribbon, hot glue, fake plant branches, and a child's head band. Something I could've made myself for half the price. It got the job done but I won't be using it again like I planned to. The head band gave me a migrane in the first 10 minutes as it was too small and my head is tiny."
1.0,These are horrible. They don't even stay snapped together to fit on a child's wrist.
1.0,I want to return it.  I’m 3+ hours past date. It’s 3 AM here.  I’ve been sick and hospitalized
1.0,WAY too small!!! Very disappointed!
1.0,The color was lighter than expected. I could have overlooked that but the pattern was a completely different floral pattern. Going to have to return.
1.0,"Uneven quality of finish. Looks and feels like a toy from the coin machine at a grocery store, but for $10."
1.0,"When it arrives, it has two scratches on the back and the bottom. Also, some parts are poorly made."
1.0,"Broke before my daughter made it out the door. Beautiful product, not realistic, super disappointed."
1.0,worthless! I threw it in the trash!
1.0,What the heck is this garbage?
1.0,Disliked the size I ordered size 4 XXXL and still to small
1.0,This was the worst quality ever! I didn't even try it on. It was super small anyways. Didn't like at all!!
1.0,The necklace turned greenish within a couple of days
1.0,No where does it say organic on clothing. I don't think it is. I contacted seller to ask and they never replied. Also sizing is way off there is only a number on inside that does not correspond to size. Mainly though I think they are trying to pass something off as organic when it's not.
1.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing this, and decided to take a chance since the cost was so low. Luckily for me, the cost was low. Like others have said, it looks nothing like the picture. The star is more like a pentagon, and the moon is big. Very sad that what should be a beautiful necklace is not. On the bright side, it was only $3.27!"
1.0,The dress did not look like the picture AT ALL. The front of the dress was just below the knees and the back of the dress had a tail. This was the most awkward looking dress I have ever seen. Such a disappointment! The dress in the picture shown is beautiful but looks nothing like what I received.
1.0,I did read the reviews and I ordered two sizes larger and still to small. ☹ will not be Ordering from them again ...I dont need to feel larger than I already am...
1.0,Ridiculous purse!!!!<br />Too stiff ....unattractive....cheap...<br />So so so disappointed:(:(
1.0,"I ignored one reviewer saying it was really scratchy, and ordered anyway bc others said how comfortable it was. How in the world could this shirt be comfortable with the material as it is? Yes, VERY SCRATCHY/ITCHY on the inside against the skin. And for being over $20, I would expect decent material, but nope. Thumbs down. Bad. Waste of time.  Returning!!"
1.0,"I didn’t like the waistband, thought it would be higher. I returned after I received them. Didn’t try them on."
1.0,Earrings received look nothing like the picture. The ones received were plain huge hoop earrings.
1.0,Band didn’t come close too fitting my wrist or my son in law.
1.0,Very cheep
1.0,Crap. Not waterproof in the slightest bit. My preschooler has worn these for school recess 3 times. Each time he's come home with wet socks and cold wet feet. Snow boots you can't wear in actual snow. Yeah they're cute but that's the extent of their redeeming qualities. Don't waste your $$
1.0,Todo bien bonito pero me llego quebrado
1.0,thin and elegant I guess but the magnets stick to the entire band and the whole thing collapses on itself into a ball you have to untangle to get the watch on your wrist. do not buy.
1.0,Stopped working after 4 days
1.0,"My normal size is a women's 2X which is what I ordered,  however the size 2X I received though pretty, fitted my 22 year niece very nicely, and she wears a size 12.  There should be some set standards for Sellers from China/International to correctly note the sizes equal to the USA sizes, and not state the same sizes as if they are equal, and it costs too much to return.  This is the 3rd time this has happened.  I gave my niece the dress because she liked it, and the other 2 pieces I put in the garbage.  I doubt I will attempt to buy anything else unless this changes."
1.0,I liked item medium and large very similar! Didn't want to try exlarge
1.0,I want the sparkly silver one.  Can't find it
1.0,"Buy these pants if you want to show off your camel toe. Also, I am 5’4” and these pants were way too long. I would have to cut off about 4-5 inches and have them hemmed. Not worth it"
1.0,If you are big breasted I wouldn’t make this purchase. When I tried it on I kept adjusting and adjusting but still kept showing the line wear the top area crosses underneath and it didn’t look cute.
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt!
1.0,Magnet not strong enough to hold it on your wrist. Wouldn't stay on just doing household chores. Can't even use it for a pocket watch because it's all one piece.
1.0,"Would provide 0 stars if I could! Very cheaply made, material is itchy, fit is not as described. I was able to get them on but the are so long at the bottom they would cover even a platform shoe. So this is definitely not the pants show in this image where the model is wearing a slipper type shoe and the pants just flow/fall on top."
1.0,"I should have believed a bad review I read on here that warned that this wig has lumps. The way the hair is sewn into this wig, the hair stands up unnaturally around the whole top of the head and there's no way to get it to lay flat or normally because that was just the way it was put together. I know it was a cheap wig, but I didn't expect it to have such a major flaw that would render it pointless. I bought this for a project and had to go to a wig store and find a better wig at the last minute when I realized how poorly put together this was."
1.0,"the product description was for &#34;bariatric&#34; sized slipper socks. they are not &#34;bariatric&#34; not even close!, maybe a &#34;large&#34; at best. there is no way that i can slide these socks over my moderately bandaged feet. i'm bummed because i went to the trouble of ordering these things in advance of my foot operation, observing the word &#34;bariatric&#34; in the description, and now when i need them they don't work. i haven't tried to return them yet, as the return shipping will most likely cost at least half the price of the item."
1.0,This shirt runs 3 sizes too small.
1.0,👎🏽
1.0,Poorly made. Totally broke after one wear
1.0,Fake i want a refund
1.0,"The dress fit well everywhere except the arms.  The fabric is heavy and stretchy, but the embroidery around the arm prevents that part of the fabric from stretching.  It squeezed my arm and created a ridge of arm fat above the embroidery.  The dress is beautiful.  The company apparently listened to people's complaints about the inside of the embroidery being scratchy because there was some backing for the embroidery on the arms."
1.0,This is not flattering on at all. Super wide and fits weird.
1.0,"Well, I thought this thing was great, three days later it wouldn’t turn on and won’t take a charge.  Waiting for replacement so we’ll see what happens there."
1.0,The zipper case keeps detaching from the lanyard after only a couple weeks.
1.0,"I thought this would be a great item for storing credit cards and business cards of doctors and the like but it became so bulky and not stream lined like the photo implies. It was also extremely difficult to extract these cards because of the tightness of the ""leather"" material. This was a great idea but poorly executed. Imagine your wallet looking like a dilapidated pyramid and you have a good idea of this product looks like. What it doesn't take into account is it's girth."
1.0,I paid too much for this hot mess that doesn’t work save your money and your time this is nothing but a small piece looks like a piece of fabric softener sheet that is supposed to trap the air coming from your nose from rising to your glasses and fogging them up. Well guess what it doesn’t work at all.
1.0,"Good price, but you get what you payed for. Very tiny and cheap looking. Would not recommend!!"
1.0,Was looking forward to these for an upcoming trip. Disappointed-  Arrived broken
1.0,Let me say Amazon as always is great with great customer service and fast delivery but unfortunately these socks are of very poor quality they state that it fits upto a size 13 but it is not true. My foot size is 12 and when I tried them on they would come right off. If I could I would return them back. They don't stay on as they claimed it would not come off.
1.0,Very cheap made<br />One was broke when received<br />Another broke putting it in for the first time
1.0,I bought this for my husband and he put it on and it was not the same material as his other on and it really did nothing for him. I ended up returning them
1.0,"Worst experience I've ever had!!! My daughters prom is Saturday and the dress was lost, therefore we don't have a dress!!! I'm so pissed!!!"
1.0,the heel of my foot doesn't fit in into the boot at all even though I ordered it a whole size bigger. I wear size 9 and I purchased a 10 and still cant fit it.
1.0,"I wrote too small in the reveiws only because it jus covered the front of my breats...i purchased the correct size but it offered no lift or push up, it just sat there."
1.0,does not keep your feet warm at all
1.0,"Was a cute shirt, till the elastic snapped around the shoulders. First time I wore it."
1.0,"Not made in the U.S.A. Poor Quality, feels like its going to fall apart. Color is not right. Everything about this sucks."
1.0,Chain and TARDIS piece fell off Immediately. Sad. It’s a really nice piece but cheaply made. Had to  return it
1.0,"I want to like this dress.  First off, it was too sheer.  Like you can see everything underneath it.  Yikes.  Then I put it on and thought I had it backwards because it was so flat in the chest area and under the arms.  Turned it around, and it fit pretty much the same way.  So disappointed, the dip-dye color was beautiful, but it’s being returned due to to the sheer color and horrid fit."
1.0,Extremely sheer top and weird material. Horrible
1.0,Very disappointed this item didn’t have no battery pack or any lights . I am not happy with this item .
1.0,Not a good sandal. Cheap and plastic-e.
1.0,"These are absolutely the cheapest looking pair of sunglasses I've ever seen..  I would not be writing this review, but, I just found out that there is a no return policy..  I would not recommend buying these at all... Useless garbage.."
1.0,"this is a second purchase for me the new brush is absolutely terrible,as you brush more bristles end up on you hat tha. the dirt you are trying to clean off ,total junk do not buy the old reviews that were rated 4 and 5 stars are for a completely different brush ,,in the trash it went like the garbage it is."
1.0,"Misleading. These are cut for tween and should be labeled ""Juniors"". Also the fabric is cheap and flimsy. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with Ralph Lauren. I was a fan for years but no more"
1.0,Looks like I’m going to be a bow legged skeleton for Halloween.. super thin and cheap. It’s crap but I’m still gonna wear it. Might not fit right cuz I’m fat but who knows. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1.0,Too small! Would like to return
1.0,So unflattering and very thin material. I have a smaller chest and it was gaping on the sides. You get what you pay for.
1.0,I’ve worn these maybe 5 times and they already broke. The small screws fall out very easily and the lenses are not connected to the frame any other way so if a screw falls out the lenses fall off. I have lots of inexpensive sunglasses I love and last for years but these are poor quality and not worth it.
1.0,Super cheap product - and hurt my ears and head to even wear!
1.0,"This is just terrible. There is a seem that runs right over the nipple part of the breast. I guess you could wear it if you were wearing a bulky sweater but, its itchy the mesh part under the arms is like burlap. I don't like it at all. waste of money"
1.0,"not as described, seller refund."
1.0,The material is really cheap and it is a turtle neck but it is baggy and not flattering at all
1.0,"This was wrong more trouble than it is worth and if the sticky part of the bra catches on any clothing, it is awful to get off. I had high hopes for this but I would not recommend it."
1.0,One gaiter was a much smaller size with zero stretch. It won't come close to fitting over my 7 year old's head. I bought a two pack for a reason but only one is actually useable.
1.0,Very large jewels. Super cheap quality and appearance
1.0,"One week and already three Grommets are now missing.  This belt won't last long at all at this rate.  The Grommets just fall apart.<br />Save your money and buy a better built belt that may cost a little more,  but won't fall apart.  I know because I do have belts that cost a little more and they are years old and look new."
1.0,Not worth the money..
1.0,The size runs extremely small and it appears that this shirt was worn before by someone wearing white deodorant.
1.0,Love the case very sturdy. Love that my eyelashes don’t touch lens.  Terrible product.  Cheap frame. Not polarized. Poor fit.
1.0,"Like the skirt but their is no way to adjust it. The top seems small but it's not, the back of it fits so loose. Looks ridiculous."
1.0,This was something I would expect a claw machine. Thank goodness it didn't cost a fortune.
1.0,Dress does not look anything like the model advertised. It is very unforgiving and will show everything. It doesn't look professionally made at all. I ordered for the color which is the only good thing about it.
1.0,Smelled awful so I handwashed it and just doing that studs fell off.
1.0,"Pad was placed where it did not really hit the right area, bone structure to fit the saddle correctly. Also, the material looked tight, but was made of a material that moved a lot. To where the pad was sliding around all the time, with every movement."
1.0,The bottle is small and maybe is longer than an inch with the stopper and the ringlet included to support the chain. Components appear to 20% glow in the dark pepples with the rest being an innocuous white powered that may facilitate or at least not hinder the few pebbles glowing abilities. You could do much better for $8 with many different items.
1.0,Very disappointed!!  After washing in cold water they were a whole size smaller than originally stated.  I was really looking forward to this purchase.
1.0,I am extremely disappointed in this product. The website is very misleading and makes them look like quality crystal earrings. They are not crystal - they are plastic. I will be returning these.
1.0,I wanted to like this dress...I really did. But the dress seemed to flare out at the wrong spot and the pockets just stand out making me look larger. Not flattering at all. Very disappointed. Will be returning. Does run true to size.
1.0,Very thin material. Was used to hold 5 water bottles 3 times and its already tearing at the top. Not a good value and poor quality
1.0,"Love this brand, but the shirt isn't worth the money."
1.0,I received every letter in the alphabet EXCEPT THE LETTER “A”.  That was one of the main letters I was needing 😡. Not a happy customer!!!
1.0,I was so disappointed. The fit was ok...the sleeves were a bit long and the dangle that caused was mildly irritating. But the worst thing is that the front of the garment pilled badly after only 2 washes on the gentle cycle and faded also in front badly. I would not buy this again and compared to similar blouses from other sellers at same or below cost...this product is not very well made. Fabric is hot when outside in warm weather.
1.0,"The website description says that the shorts have 95% of cotton. However, I didn't find the label with the cotton percentage on it. It doesn't feel that there are even 50% of cotton in the shorts. Also the quality of the stiches is bad. I want to return the shorts."
1.0,"If you are looking for a replacement for Oakley Sunglasses, this product is not the one.  It doesn't fit the frame snuggly....the lenses have some wiggle room. The visual is very yellow and produces a terrible glare, instead of removing it.<br /><br />I will not recommend this product."
1.0,The band fell apart after only 2 weeks of use.  Poorly made.
1.0,I was very disappointed when my shirt came in. I ordered 2 sizes up and it still is too tight in the arm/armpit area. The print is a tad off center.
1.0,This bead looks very cheap.<br />It is very light and hollow. The hinge is weak and the closing is not made by a magnet but a clip that will likely not last long.<br />Not suitable as gift
1.0,Pedí una XL y demasiado chica párese Talla S demasiado chiquito
1.0,"The buckle is too small for the strap, and the first time I tried to put it on, it immediately tore the strap."
1.0,"I put these earrings in the very evening they arrived. They looked great, the backs fit snugly to the posts... I had high hopes for them. I have never had an allergic reaction to any metal that was truly hypoallergenic, and I have a few body piercings for which I use only surgical steel jewelry. Never have my ears been so deformed by swelling (my lobes are HUGE), or been so red, irritated, painful, and GOOPY as they are now after wearing these earrings for two days.<br /><br />At first, I thought that maybe I just needed to remove these before bed and before showering, figuring that the extra-long posts might cause snagging, tugging, and pressure on my ear lobes as I toss and turn or wash my hair. I put antibiotic ointment on my ears after removing the earrings for the evening, and then put them back in the next day. The ointment calmed the redness and itchiness, and my ears hurt less, so I thought everything was going to be fine, but when I removed the earrings that second evening, they were stuck to my ears.<br /><br />My piercing holes were so irritated that they had been oozing around the earrings all day, and the earrings had become practically cemented to the flesh of my lobes. Removing the earrings that second evening was extremely painful, and it ripped some of the tissue right off, causing bleeding. I have NEVER had ANY sort of reaction to anything else that was labeled &#34;surgical steel,&#34; &#34;stainless steel,&#34; or &#34;hypoallergenic,&#34; so I have no idea what this company thinks they're doing, using such verbiage in the item description.<br /><br />If you suffer metal allergies of any kind, do yourself a favor and AVOID this brand, altogether. I'll never trust any of their items, after this horrible, painful reaction to their &#34;hypoallergenic steel.&#34; The photos I have included are of my ears after 2 days of wear, AFTER having cleaned off the blood and the crusted up pus, and applying more antibiotic ointment (the ointment has been the only thing to calm my ears, and has in no way  added to the negative reaction)."
1.0,"I liked that this ring was adjustable, but it tarnished after 2 days. I had never had a ring tarnish so quickly and so GROSSLY. It wasn’t just turning my skin green and fading, it looked like the varnish was disintegrating. Really really cheap. Good if you’re going as Harry Styles during Halloween and want the rings for one night, but terrible otherwise."
1.0,This prouduct was terrible how could you sell
1.0,"Item arrived discolored and what looks to have mold specks on it.  My daughter needed this for a class event, guess she'll be the only one not in costume 🙄"
1.0,I loved the overall look and design of this dress which is why I ordered it.  And I'm so sorry to say that the quality of the material is just not up to par.
1.0,Just a little to large and I got a small
1.0,"This company has engaged in scams on social media where they promise to do random giveaways however they rig them by requiring winners to have a certain threshold of followers. The GIs themselves are nothing special, and for similar prices or slightly more you could get a Sanabul Gi which is easily 2 xs the quality of a Elite Sports Gi."
1.0,"The pants are too long for this 5’2” girl.. instead of the cute jogger style look on the model, it looks super frumpy on me!"
1.0,Loved it. Till it turned my arm green when I first wore it.
1.0,The rose gold wore off and they look a funny gold now
1.0,It's a cheap asian made imported shirt of average quality... similar shirts are all over amazon for $30.00.<br />It's OK but not worth triple the price of an average shirt.<br />If it was hand dyed or hand tailored in the USA... maybe but its imported and unremarkable.<br />Save your money buy a cheaper shirt you'll be happier because you won't feel ripped off.
1.0,It was about 3 sizes too small.
1.0,Change colors
1.0,The skirt is beautiful. First thing I noticed when I put it on... there is a hole in the pocket. Why?
1.0,"Attractive design, but quality not up to Amazon standards. They don't look like they will go thru more than a couple of washings."
1.0,They're super cute but feels like I'm walking on the bare floor
1.0,it was out of shape
1.0,Excellent quality but need to return for better size.
1.0,Very stiff and they should definitely NOT be called pillow slides. The name is very deceiving. Cheap material. They are more like board slides not like a pillow and I returned them right away. Save your money and don’t bother.
1.0,Dress was to loose.
1.0,"Terrible quality, the fabric is super cheap. I don’t recommend buying this."
1.0,"Pretty but… We measured my daughter a couple times and she was in the middle of two sizes. We even went with the smaller size, but yet dresses still swimming on her with a good 3 to 4 inches of slack. Also, the slit is barely above the knee when it supposed to be high upper thigh. The dress is also very long, and even with high heels could be a tripping hazard. My daughter is 5’6” 155-160 lbs5"
1.0,This product has such a narrow middle area that my daughter’s friend who wears shoes 2 sizes smaller than these said the toe box was fine but they were too tight around the arches.
1.0,I did not like this. Kept coming off and pulling my hairs
1.0,They tarnished almost immediately... Not happy
1.0,The color was not like the photo
1.0,you get 1 not a pair! never again it went in the trash!
1.0,only order if you are Tony Soprano sized or larger
1.0,I'm XXL but bought XXXL and well it fit .y son perfectly and he's a large.
1.0,Poorly made item broke the first time I tried to put it on. Do not buy!
1.0,horrible item  they  should be ASHAMED of then shipping  this GARBAGE GARBAGE
1.0,These are very soft and looks great but they're not true to size. I wear a women's large 12-14 and decided to purchase these in the X-Large. According to the size chart that's a size 16-18 but I couldn't even get one leg in. I'm so disappointed but I think my 10 yr old niece can wear these. They run very small.
1.0,Its REALLY small. Barely will clasp
1.0,"As a professional photographer of 40+ years, I knew that I was paying for the ""Lens""...not the ""Frames"".<br />After buying the first pair, as you can see, I bought all three pair.<br />The first pair broke in about a month. I used a plastic tube that came with a can of WD40...a paper clip...and some super glue to make a repair. Specifically, the temples are held in place by two small pins. (About 1/16 inch in length). I drilled a hole all the way through the temple of the frame, and then used the paper clip ""INSERTED IN THE PLASTIC TUBE"". I put the tube through the temple, then cut off the excess tube.<br />After I removed all the excess hardened ""SUPER GLUE"", I had a ""NEW PIN"" the same size as the other pin on the opposite side. I reattached the temple and all was fine.<br /><br />Then, the right temple on the Night Vision glasses broke as indicated in the photo. I just used some Super Glue to fix this. All in all, I have fixed all three pairs. I am sure that the pins will continue to break, but since I was so foolish to buy these in the first place, I will continue to fix these.<br /><br />Don't buy these...""UNLESS YOU WANT A HOBBY""!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shooter Boone."
1.0,Couldn't wear these. They have a slight ridge/texture on them that hurt my feet.
1.0,After about 3 wears the band broke.<br /><br />Terrible quality. Maybe that’s why I need to buy the original
1.0,"I wear a medium and have worn so for many years. These shorts were a medium and I found the waist band to be much too tight.  Also, the  crotch area was too restricted. I found the oveall fit to be most uncomfortable and I returned the shorts."
1.0,"As another noted, the seams along the side of the dress don’t line up so the pattern is completely off."
1.0,"The fit was odd, and the material stayed wrinkled even after a steam treatment.  Had to return."
1.0,"I don't know what to even think- after reading reviews I assumed the fit would be a non-issue and these sounded like a winner.  I am SO disappointed. I wear a 7.5-8 and I could hardly even get these over my foot. I'm pretty blown away by this size issue and will be contacting Amazon. I was really looking forward to some nice new colorful warm socks, cold toes eagerly waiting all week and so happy when they came, only to be so stunningly disappointed.<br />I wasn't very impressed by the feel of the fabric either, it wasn't what I would call thick or soft at all- not that it matters since essentially I can't even put them on.  Sometimes I really just wonder about products and reviews!"
1.0,Won't cinch tight. ( Bad design 3 different ones same issue. Belt end frays and unravels won't stay right.
1.0,Super cute dress but had to return as it does not cover the sides of your chest. At all. Couldn’t even stitch it to make it work. And I’m a small b cup
1.0,"Was very displeased with this purchase. Never had issues with purchasing XL turtle necks from Amazon. Issues are the Following:<br /><br />Extremely sheer material, you can see right through it<br />Sizing was very much off. the bottom of the shirt didn't even cover under my breasts. Was running late to work and had to throw on a sweater as this would have looked very inappropriate. Will stay away from buying from this seller again."
1.0,First of all they forgot to send the pins. Then once they did they also sent me a bonus band. Sounds great right?! Well the bonus band was defective and so it was useless. And when I finally got to use the band I bought it lasted maybe a week with my workouts and stretched out to the point it was very loose. Needless to say two bands in less than a month and they are both in the trash. Bought an adjustable nylon band with Velcro and will never go back to these cheap ones again!
1.0,"Llegaron en mal estado los productos, negros, oxidados."
1.0,"It's a nice bag, but when I actually needed to lock it up the lock stop working, it's not a good lock. When the lock won't work it makes the entire point of this useless."
1.0,DO NOT BUY! Absolutely horrible! One wash and it was complety destroyed! The picture on it is completely white and cracked even with following washing instructions.  Guess I paid for my daughter to look cute for one day at her Valentines party
1.0,I think these are gorgeous.  However the stick that goes through your ear broke on mine when I tried to out them on.  Then I went on vacay and forgot to return them.<br />They are gorgeous though.  But — idk if they will all break or I just got unlucky
1.0,"I liked the price for this product.  Unfortunately, it broke within less than a month. Very dissapointed!"
1.0,"This is not a wrap dress! As soon as I pulled it out of the package and found out that it was incorrectly advertised I returned it, so I can't really speak to the fit. Don't get it if you are looking for this specific style."
1.0,I retired this jacket. It is real junk nothing like the picture The fabric is bad
1.0,"Got an XL- usually wear small/medium for super oversized look but it is more like 2x Small :( does not go beneath breasts or bra even.  Now looking at reviews, this shirt and a couple others are not the same length or material as universally advertised! Super sad with this purchase."
1.0,Bueno no me agradó porq no me funciona el botón de encendido no me nunca camino
1.0,"So I was hoping I would get the same large smartphone crossbody my sister has but in a different print. Nope. This is not the small wallet but it is also not the large wallet it is some sort of hybrid that holds half as many credit cards but still fits my phone. I love the print but hate that it is half the size I needed. (See photos, mine is the black trip one my sister has the grey trim one)"
1.0,I replaced the once I had in for this one and thought is was beautiful.  Easy to put in and everything.  But because of it being pastic it keeps getting stuck in my gums and tearing my skin.  The gem has been pulled through my lip several times and cause an infection.
1.0,The bra material  felt cheap and rough. There was barely no padding in the cups. The description said padded cups. Wasted my money.
1.0,Material quality is low.
1.0,Looked matronly and was too big
1.0,Some of the stones came- OFF ! I tried to put it back with a glue but it made the stones look DULL ! NOT RECOMMENDED!
1.0,These are totally fake
1.0,I bought a grey one love d it I bought another one poor quality 😔
1.0,"The listing says it is made of silk, but it is 50% Polyester/50% Spandex."
1.0,"I didn’t like the color, and I want to send it back. Sorry!"
1.0,Hardly worn less than a handful and the pocket is ripped at the seem completely. Phone fell out my pocket. Stay away or dont use the pockets.
1.0,I bought this case just because it has carabiner but they just sent me a regular case but I didn't return it because its not worth to pay for mail again.... Then I started to use it but second time I use that case zipper got broken.. Dont waste your money for this case even one penny..
1.0,I will be disputing.. looks absolutely nothing like the picture... the white pants look like they were made from a bed sheet .. it’s a  mess honestly..
1.0,It was very cheap.  Fell apart the same day
1.0,"I know, I know, it's a cheap piece, but it should be a quarter because it's the same quality as a bubble gum machine ring."
1.0,Fits true to size BUT not quality and NO fleece lining inside as advertised. Disappointed.
1.0,"The names are not where the picture shows them to be. Part of the lettering is coming off, and it looks about 10 years old in just a couple of months."
1.0,I received 2 dresses. Both are a bit too small and I want to return or exchange them. There are no packing slips or return instructions.
1.0,"Terrible gloves - leather is very soft, almost cheap feeling. Wore these to work 2 days in Chicago and they already are wearing down on the fingers - returning immediately."
1.0,The cap was made very cheap the logo was stamped on. Not what I expected. WILL NOT purchase that company again.<br /><br />I like to shop on Amazon and will continue.
1.0,I very much dislike this not very good gloves. I use them for riding my motorcycle and they do not keep your hands warm under 45 degrees at all very disappointed...
1.0,Complete garbage. It’s abouy half the size of my pinky finger. tiny piece of junk
1.0,"Do not buy! Does not look like the picture. Fabric is not the same as it looks on the picture!!! If you buy it, your basically buying a robe for yourself!"
1.0,The dress was adorable but way to small.
1.0,I only got one wear out of them before the broke. Very very cheaply made!
1.0,Zipper broke the very first week I used it!! Company would not replace
1.0,Terrible quality. Practically plastic<br /> Not breathable. Like wearing a heavy shower curtain..not cloth.
1.0,One lit up and the other did not.  I didn't return it since I needed it the next day.  Disappointed because they are really cute when the lights work.
1.0,Does not look like pic. I ordered a small and it is HUGE!!! The chest area looks some what low cut but the dress I got is almost up to my neck. Looks horrible. I will be returning
1.0,"advertised and marked as size 8, these were a six at most"
1.0,Product was not as pictured.  The collar is white and the body is ivory.  Not acceptable.
1.0,Feeling like an idiot for having bought this even though it was purchased as a gag gift for my child I still think it wasn’t what they purported it as
1.0,I bought this for my nephew and he wore it for a few days before the zipper broke off. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap as can be and makes everything distorted
1.0,Garbage plain and simple.  I ordered an 18 inch necklace to wear to my daughter’s wedding.  Not only is it not 18” but the clasp fell off before I could even try to put it on.  $19.99 + $7.00 for shipping down the drain.
1.0,Was excited to try these and they were not what I expected! Definitely didn’t look or feel like a size large. Got them and returned them the same day.
1.0,The lense is hazy and there is no way to clear it. Tried to clean it several times and no luck.
1.0,"This shirt is huge. I typically wear a 2x in t-shirts and I like my tees a little loose, but this was not flattering at all."
1.0,"I can't even get he pant leg over my thigh, and I even ordered bigger just in case. Horrible."
1.0,"The third time my daughter wore them, the Elephant became detached from stud.  These were a Christmas present, so she was heartbroken."
1.0,I got this for my grandson. He wore it for 15 minutes and the inside liner started to rip away. We returned it for a refund. It looked nice but way to cheaply made.
1.0,The tights were very small and didn't stretch or adjust well. Will not buy these again!
1.0,I bought another one and it still too small
1.0,"Product not as shown, disappointed"
1.0,COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH!!!
1.0,I was really disappointed with this product it fell apart really quickly
1.0,"BAIT & SWITCH! I ordered Sky Blue. & got a dirty dark blue with rips & distressed areas so bad that the sleeve will rip off from taking it on & off because it is too small (I ordered a larger size even)! Poor presentation! Item was used (it was supposed to be NEW!), filthy yellow spots, smells, etc. Bag was melted shut & coat smells of melted plastic bag! BAIT & SWITCH!"
1.0,Colors of product are not the same as the picture and seller does not allow returns.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,"I purchased a few wrap dresses to get me through my nursing period. But the swallow dress was teeny tiny, despite purchasing a size large. According to the sizing chart, I should have been a large, but I honestly feel the dress was about two-three sizes too small in the chest area. It doesn't even come close to fitting.<br /><br />According to the other reviews, this only seems to be a problem with the swallow version."
1.0,"several large beads missing, long chain broken - looks used :("
1.0,"it was fine until it was not.  first one broke, i expect the second one to follow.  the issues is the spring in the buckle.  it is gone.  i am losing weight, so a spontaneous belt failure while out is an issue.....  KingMoore - Never More"
1.0,"Unable to buy the item, because there is not sufficient information about the size of the glasses (example: 54mm,19mm,135mm)"
1.0,These slippers are advertised to have wool material. However the label states ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS.
1.0,Note: this is not review on the product just a review on the listing. I did NOT buy this product.<br />I  Came here to buy this Belt. But seeing this reviews I think they are fishy.. 86 reviews in one week all positive and no reviews before. Well ! new way of selling product gullible online buyer.
1.0,"I bought this to take to the beach as a light cover up or to use as a simple going-out dress. I was not impressed with the fabric. I am 5’7 and 230lbs and it was a stretchy fabric that did not accentuate the good parts of my body! I sent this back unfortunately. It is not flattering on bigger/curvy gals. If you are smaller sized , I think you would like this!"
1.0,The quality is bad. The nose side piece was missing.
1.0,The latched didn't close. The weight of the earrings in uneven. The earrings fall forward
1.0,I loved the way this fit<br />My only problem is the dress. Does not come as the picture describes.And it has a lot of pulls in the dress because of the material.But comes in a see through dress without what is shown.You will have to buy something to wear under this.It is just a see. Through sheer dress that is not something you could wear in public with what you receive.And they sent the wrong color!
1.0,This product broke before I even was able to wear them once:( the “Pearl” isn’t glued into the metal part and just fell out. Hopefully I can fix it myself but I won’t be purchasing this again.
1.0,"Short and cheap. The material is horrible.  I returned immediately and a month later they are trying to say they didn’t receive it and recharge me.  Beware.  Did the return through Amazon, returned and they are threatening to recharge me."
1.0,Ugh!  My feet slip all over the place inside these things.  Not what I expected at all!
1.0,Ordered WHITE got a cream color- very disappointed
1.0,MADE IN CHINA<br />WAY TOO SMALL<br />WILL NOT BUY AGAIN
1.0,"Way too big, had to return."
1.0,Not what they appear to be. In pic they look very colorful but they have no real color at all just a couple very light color pieces and the rest of it looks like broken pieces of clear plastic. and they are HUGE
1.0,All these watches have dead batteries. Don’t even bother.
1.0,Were broken when taken out of the package. Will be requesting a replacement.
1.0,Sized much differently than other styles from this brand. I have another 1 for U gown that I completely adore. This one not so much.
1.0,"Not even worth the 1 star, a piece of crap that even $0.99 would have been overpriced and $20 is definitely not worth, didn't last more that a day."
1.0,"I did not like the quality of the belt.  The elastic was very cheap and became edition very quickly. I am not a Thick or heavy person, there is no reason this belt should have stretched out so quickly"
1.0,The lenses felt like they were dying to fall out. I have a black friend who bought the black thick ones and they look great but I bought the purple ones and there horrible. I have a mental illness and am on SSI and this is a waste of taxpayer money. There not made right and the lenses feel like there dying to fall out.
1.0,These do not fit my Fitbit3.
1.0,Awful. I guess you get what you pay for.  Cheaply made.
1.0,"The reading spot is like old school bifocals, no mid range line at all. I wasn't expecting prescription glasses at the price, but I expect to get what is advertised.  The blue blocking at least seems to work a bit. At least the monitor/tablet/tv screen look different with them on."
1.0,Extremely see-through. Fabric is not swimsuit material. Not impressed at all. Will return.
1.0,Very disappointed. Bought it for our 6 year old granddaughter’s bday. The first night the beads cracked. She loved the bracelet and then cried because it broke. Made very poorly in my opinion.
1.0,Wasn't described as in picture  displeased!
1.0,Chain is mediocre and the &#34;amulet&#34; is solid plastic. It doesn't open and the &#34;sand&#34; in it it dried up glitter glue. Much larger than in the movie. Not at all what I wanted or expected. Absolutely do not recommend.
1.0,Choker part broke apart after first time wearing it.  Disappointing
1.0,"This dress is super cute nice material but very small around the bust area and I’m a pretty small person , Definitely an Asian size seems like"
1.0,Very thin material. Also very short fitting. Did not like and returned.
1.0,Okay..this dress was made very strange.<br />I read the reviews and was truly hoping that i would recieve what other's described.<br />Clearly i didn't..instead i recieved what looked like a 10 yr old would sew quickly together. The fabric is see through on the top and the bottom half feels odd. The waist line was directly on my chest. At $24 i dont think ill take anymore chances.
1.0,"The style of this dress is me all day so I was excited to get. However, when I opened it and felt the scratchy, cheap t-shirt material, I didn’t even bother trying it on. The description says it’s a poly/cotton/spandex blend, but this is definitely not that. One wash and it’s a play dress for my 4-yr old niece. Maybe the other colors may be different, but the pink one looks like cheap cotton t-shirt dress. Definitely not fit for business or cocktails."
1.0,These are not the ones that come on the boots as stated in the description. The laces are very waxy and are too long. Regret buying these
1.0,If I could give a no star I would. Ridiculously small. I bought a large and it was maybe an extra small.
1.0,These sandals should not be sold on Amazon. Customer service is non responsive and the quality is a joke. The shoes have an odor that is so strong I had to put them outside. I want to give them zero stars but it won’t let me.
1.0,The sleeve length was extremely short. I ordered a medium and the sleeves are more like 3/4 length instead of covering the hand like shown in the picture.  Unfortunately I returned this cardigan even though I really liked the color and style.
1.0,Too big and very poor quality.
1.0,If you order this add at least 2 sizes
1.0,"The dress is shorter than I expected, the inexpensive fabric  causes the dress to raise."
1.0,The fabric.
1.0,These are not what I expected....they are huge and do not fit my piercing.
1.0,"It’s not even hemmed. It has raw edges and thus will fray and since it’s not hemmed, it’s too loose to stay up over the face."
1.0,It’s not fair that I can’t get my money back for shoes I can’t wear.
1.0,I bought a Large and it still is very hard to put on.......once it's on I'm okay with it
1.0,Does not stay closed when passport inserted in holder.  Adding credit cards and money will just add to not closing problem.  Description of item indicates there would be a snap closure.  Online photos are accurate though showing no snap.
1.0,I didn’t love this product it was way to big and very long almost like a trench coat. I wasn’t able to wear it all because of that so I was a little bummed.
1.0,"Quality is terrible. It arrived stained, seemed like it's been used before. Not recommended"
1.0,"Absolutely awful in every way possible!! Color is like slime, fit is horrible and beyond cheaply made and looking!"
1.0,Most seams were in sewn
1.0,didn't not slide into my watch. not good at all.
1.0,Thought I was buying a quality product. Already leaks after 1 day.
1.0,"These look great- exactly as pictured. However, the soles are rock hard, and completely inflexible. Even with the addition of gel insoles, these boots hurt my feet, and back. No support, whatsoever. Also, the zippers are sharp. They rub holes in my socks, leggings, and skin, after one day of wear."
1.0,"Unas joyas que lucirán muy lindas en las orejas de tus hijas, sobrinas, nietas, o entenadas que quieras quedar bien, y sin gastar mucho dinero"
1.0,Washed as instructed and came out with lint all over it??? Have other black shirts I washed the same way and that does not happen?? Very disappointed.
1.0,The necklace is beautiful but very soft metal and bends very easily.
1.0,Sized really small
1.0,"UPDATE FOR SELLER: I have attached photos. The pins actually fit fine. It's the watch band itself that prevents the pins from depressing 100% to attach to the phone.<br /><br />This arrived in time for my upcoming vacation, and I thought it was pretty cute, if not an exact match in color, at least not bad.  It came in a box together with a kit for changing out links if you need to which I thought was neat, and they even threw in a ""free gift"" of a rose gold colored and jeweled necklace that would be cute for a young girl.  However the problem is that it comes with pins for attaching it to the watch that are too long by just a hair. Enough that you think it might fit, but doesn't.  I tried both sides, and all 4 pins they sent.<br /><br />I fought for about 15 minutes trying to get it in by shoving the pin down as hard as I could, but it just would not make it in.  I'm kind of glad because if it did, I don't know how I'd ever get it out short of sawing it out because there's just no way to make the pin depress enough to fit in and out.<br /><br />I'm giving one star for packaging and instructions, and a second star because it is cute.  However, it will not fit in a 42mm Samsung."
1.0,"My initial impression on first inspection was that this might turn out to be a sturdy product, though I had serious doubts about the metallic blue &#34;TOP GRAIN OIL TAN LEATHER&#34; claim imprinted on the inside surface.  Whatever the material, the belt at least looked good.  Unfortunately, after only a few days of light wear, the color layer has peeled away from the core material underneath where the belt rubs against the back center belt loop of my jeans.  The revealed core appears to be some sort of composite material, possibly with a paper-thin layer of leather laminated onto it.  The color layer is also flaking away along the edges."
1.0,Cheap materials and messed up sizing.i ordered 2 sizes bigger they sent a smaller size.  Not satified at all.
1.0,"poor material, fits weird and looks nothing like the photo"
1.0,Didnt wear it its to big i orderd a medium and it fits like a large
1.0,I wasn't happy with the printing we're all mad here is so small you can barely read it and the placement of the smile is small n makes you look silly  just doesn't look right
1.0,Pants ripped when I put them on. Quality 👎🏼
1.0,"Not moldable all there is is two tont holes, they dont for correctly in your mouth and they dont stay up, if I could give 1 star I would."
1.0,"Cheap quality, bends and can't wear it. Really think/cheap silver."
1.0,"no, not for me"
1.0,This jacket came stained and ripped inside
1.0,Not so good for me. Ears got infected.
1.0,"I purchased the large size after measuring my calf at the widest point.  They fit fine and go on easy but have no more compression than a regular pair of socks.  They were useless.  I wanted sleeves rather than compression socks, because they tend to cut into my ankles.  These did nothing at all, so I'm returning them.  Maybe buying a smaller pair might work, but unfortunately after touching the material itself, it's obvious they won't give me the compression I need."
1.0,Not sized correctly.
1.0,"This is a ""dress and play"" style bracelet.  While it is cute it is the old school little girl costume jewelry quality slightly better then a bubble gum machine.  The material is a metal tin like quality that you can press and mold / bend with your finger tips.  The gems are bright in color but have that obviously fake quality.  And everything will turn your skin a slightly green tint by the end of the day.  If you tug on this while wearing it, you will loose it."
1.0,Very long shipping time poor quality dirty had to clean up one necklace and the other is unwearable due to a white film inside under the glass
1.0,"Literally useless - the cap won’t stay on my children’s heads, and the goggles aren’t clear. So disappointing"
1.0,Only thing that was the same as the picture was a zipper. The fabric was cheap and  shiny outer lining to tank is not there.. Disappointed
1.0,Broke on first wear
1.0,"The large is still to small, these closes are made for women who are built like little girls.  Large is like a size 6."
1.0,"These jeans are atrocious in just about every way I could mention.  The waistline looks weird, it leaves a gap in back even when cinched tighter than I could comfortably stand it, the fabric is thin like jeggings and leaves a visible panty line even with no-show panties, and the color is not what was pictured (it is a weird, off-putting bright blue jean shade).  And I had to jump into them even though the waistline was plenty big for me.  Not comfortable at all once on, either."
1.0,The ad for this item did not say it ran small.
1.0,No stars if I can !! Look so cheap like plastic toy! And it broken when I open up !
1.0,"I own 6 of these tops in black and white and I bought them specifically because they were cotton. They last a long time and are very comfortable. I ordered two of the green version and it's now a polyester fabric. Very rough and scratchy, irritated my skin. Color is nice but can't wear it. Listing needs to be updated to reflect which ones are cotton and which are polyester, unless all of them are poly now, either way, misleading and disappointing."
1.0,Ordered size 11. these are an inch longer. I compared this shoe to a few other size 11s that I have and and it is also one inch longer than my other shoes. It seems that this shoe is a size 12
1.0,Cheap pants that's way too small.
1.0,Not as well made as I would have expected.  No response from company.  Will not buy again.
1.0,Cheap fabric and very smelly
1.0,It does not stay as I want when I draw n set up the face
1.0,Only received two out of four rings. One of the two is a size larger than the other
1.0,"These croakies are not soft at all, but very rough which I find uncomfortable. Other croakies I have are soft, pass on these."
1.0,"terrible quality, bought and then immediately returned"
1.0,"Poor quality, and the sizing does not match American shoe sizes for kids. I will never buy again."
1.0,Ordered 2x fits like. Jr size
1.0,Cheap material nothing like pic
1.0,it broke the day I got it and it doesn't look like the picture
1.0,The elastic band hardly holds up.
1.0,I thought these would have good arch support but they did not. Also they looked very cheap. I returned
1.0,"I am a big girl and this bathing suit is high waisted, so if I pull it up to cover my chest my bottom is showing and if I pull it down my chest is showing!!!also the see thou I wear a 2x and ordered a 4x and it’s just to small I will be sending it back"
1.0,"Size misrepresented.  Keep-in-mind, people are smaller in China."
1.0,I was so upset when I paid twenty dollars for these shoes and when they arrived the price tag was attached @ nine dollars!
1.0,"I don't like how the neck strap chokes me...also I can't wear my usual bra because it shows along the back and side---sadly, the material will not allow you to go bra less unless you want a lot of attention. I can't see how I'll get any use from wearing his shirt. I may cut it into a workout shirt"
1.0,"Garmin fast fix clips have to be installed(!) using screwdriver; the set of those shipped is only one, which means if you want to change one to another, you've got to use screwdriver again - so whats the point of ""quickfix""?  Then, width of the leather band is less then of the Garmin - so quickfix looks like ugly adapter for the smaller band. Quality of leather is low. Overall - unhappy with this purchase"
1.0,Terrible . Way too long & way too big. If you don't have curves don't bother . So disappointed
1.0,Broke after the first wear.
1.0,I purchased these slippers I was in love with them until ONE MONTH LATER when they sadly stopped working. I couldn't believe I was spending this much money on a pair of slippers to begin with but I thought at least they well keep my feet warm during this cold winter. Well unfortunately they didn't even last TWO MONTHS.. I wouldn't suggest wasting your money as they do not last very long at all....
1.0,"The photo shows a sturdy, well made felt hat with felt accessories. The actual hat is extremely thin felt and plastic accessories.  Huge disappointment!!"
1.0,"Dont judge something by the way it looks....its really cute in picture but in reality its so freaking huge!!! It  feels as thick as a telephone book, cheap material. Disappointed😔"
1.0,Order two sizes above.
1.0,Turned skin a dirty black color.  They saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; is true.  Better to spend a little more and get something that doesn't arrive tarnished already.
1.0,"The crossbody strap on this bag broke after less than a week of use. I really loved the look and size of this bag, very frustrated with the outcome."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b0b040d8facefd06084ad3a02b662366]] It would have served its purpose if it didn’t tear apart after only 6 weeks. Pretty weak overall design.
1.0,"The stripes on the dress waver back and forth and it looks very cheap and awkward, not to mention it did not look like the advertised dress. I was given the runaround because they did not want to give a full refund (shipping was too expensive, yet still located in the continental US just as I am) and had to file a claim through Amazon to get my refund."
1.0,I have to iron it because it wrinkles after washing and drying it
1.0,Cheap and flimsy! They scuff up easily not worth the buy
1.0,"Very cheaply made, I will be amazed if these last ponder then a season if that. Feels and looks like cheap leather and the “leather” ripped some while putting them on spur. I don’t recommend ANY Showman products from experience with more than just this item. Very cheaply made and quality does not last. Silver studs did fall off immediately during installation on to spurs"
1.0,Cheap<br />Fades<br />Goodwill is better
1.0,"Do not buy. I bought these camel leggings to wear as khaki pants for work.. I will never wear these and will return. First, the material is not regular legging material— it’s more like super thick tights that look shiny as if I’m supposed to be wearing it in a circus show. Second, the camel color is not khaki/beige, it is a light shiny yellow gold. Thirdly, you can see right through them even with nude-colored no-show underwear."
1.0,The top is at least 2 sizes too large and the shorts have wide legs but the waist is synched tightly and cuts into her. The material is very papery which I wouldn't have minded due to the price but the size is horrible.
1.0,They came with a hole already in the crotch. Do not buy these they are terrible!!!! I was supposed to be refunded but it never went through and they will not do anything about it.
1.0,Purchased this for a friend
1.0,Broke first time I wore it.
1.0,Paper thin and see through. Size up 2 sizes - way to small. Color is true to picture
1.0,Could not apply to my feet.  Instructions say to roll down and pull on feet.  Problem is when I rolled it down the inside was too small to pull up over my foot.
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes larger as directed and was still too small.
1.0,No sirve se rompió
1.0,I ordered a small and it's like a tent on me. I'm 5'6 and 120lbs.  Wayyy too big.
1.0,I’m pretty petite the medium was tiny on me and not in a good way. Muffin top to the extreme. The top is awkward- I thought the lace up was the back- it’s the front. Returned
1.0,What a terrible purchase. Bought in November or December and the zipper has ripped from the seam all the way around and kinky carried my phone and a book. I want my money back. Unacceptable. Wants photos? Got em.....
1.0,"This is pretty, but it runs super small on top; no place for 38 DD's.  My 13-year old had same issue with the top.  &#34;A&#34; cups might stand a chance."
1.0,Broke right out of package not even worn
1.0,"The wires keep catching on everything, was not made well"
1.0,Nononoo muy malo no enviaron el conjunto solo el de arriba y mi talla es l y pedí xl y aún así muy pequeño y lo más malo que solo me enviaron la bata el camisón de adentro no lo enviaron
1.0,Fell apart after 3 months. The pins started falling apart.
1.0,"Sound quality was good, but unfortunately after the initial charge I could never sync again to use.<br />FYI- If you have a small head this will be big on you."
1.0,The show is stretchy. It doesn’t support your feet and let’s your toes slide off from the shoe Lmaoo
1.0,This won’t fit a laptop. Very disappointed
1.0,"The only thing good about these is the price. The headline claims 20-30mmHg, when in fact they are much less. My feet ballooned wearing them."
1.0,"They looked nice, but after wearing just a few times two of the blue tiles came out.  Sad because they were sharp looking and solid."
1.0,"I had been in the market for a wood watch as I love watches and the idea of a wood one I thought was very cool. I bought this as an entry level wood watch to see if it was something I would wear. After receiving the watch I was very disappointed in the style of the watch. In the picture the wood grain looks very detailed has a great color to it. In the picture the leather strap appears to be a very nice quality of leather. This could not be further from the truth. The wood colored the face of the watch is darker than the outside part. It is so dark you can barely see the hands of the watch as they move. The leather strap is very thin and poorly made. The glass or plastic cover is so cheap that the one day I decided to try to wear it, it cracked when my arm lightly bumped against the wall at a restaurant we were eating at. I showed all my friends and they could not believe it either. They also hated the look and asked me why would I buy such a cheap looking watch. When I showed them the picture they also agreed the watch I had looked a lot different.<br /><br />BUYER BEWEAR!!! Do not buy unless You like cheap products."
1.0,very cheap total wrong size than advertised wouldn't give refund
1.0,"Terrible quality , colors are so faint , not a good buy . I’m trying to rep pinoy pride but got China scammed ."
1.0,This shirt is a very weird brownish color and peach.  Not at all like the pictures for the shirt. It really isn't pretty in person.  I bought a size up so it fit everywhere except the length on the arms.  They literally fell 6 inches below my fingertips!
1.0,These things would hardly fit a ten year old in a large.
1.0,Way too big. Not great quality.
1.0,Wtf supposed to be a necklace n it comes like this 3 clasps  3 wtf
1.0,Does not fit.

1.0,Sizes are way off. Couldn't even get up my leg/thigh. Waste of my money.
1.0,"This fits  well but not long enough,I give it one star because  the dress is stinky I wash it next day after I receive  it, it still smell  would not recommend,"
1.0,Material not as advertised.  The gown was very heavy and super long.  Returned it.  Watch for a switch in materials.
1.0,They too little for my nose.Total Waste of money 🤦🏾‍♀️.they look bigger in pictures
1.0,very fine / fragile fabric. only for an operative block for a few weeks.<br />too expensive for fabric quality.
1.0,They were cute but none of them had the balls on the ends I had no way to fasten then. I am not aware if they were to be purchased separately or not.
1.0,Don’t like them at all.
1.0,"First of all I ordered a small, cause i am petite. 5'1 skinny. I dont like the material. Also its too long and doesnt fit the way zi want it to."
1.0,Necklace is for a baby's neck.
1.0,Completely see through!
1.0,This is crappy and poorly made. Don’t waste your money on this product. I would return it but it felled off my chain just after my first wear. Please learn from my mistake.
1.0,"This item runs very small around the waist, because they didn’t tell about the lace band around the middle of the skirt which as no give."
1.0,Not a good fit. Width was ok but too short.
1.0,"Super cute dress, but was huge. I could’ve ordered down a size or teo"

1.0,These shorts were way too small for my husband.
1.0,Fell apart after a couple of uses
1.0,"We purchased 6 pairs of these for our daughters. My 4 year old daughter wore a pair on the first day, and the rubber bubbles busted or peeled off day 1! $20 for 3 pairs is a lot of money for socks that are cheaply made."
1.0,Incredibly disappointed with the quality and fit
1.0,Ordered a xl was like a medium way to small
1.0,I didnt like the fabric. Felt cheap.
1.0,"Looked very pretty. Very disappointed in the fact that even though it wasn't an expensive piece, it should have lasted more than wearing it a couple times."
1.0,Not even remotely close to the color I ordered. It’s very golden. Not even close to olive.
1.0,"Fabric is low quality. I'm afraid if I wash it, it will shrink."
1.0,The locking mechanism failed the very first time I put the belt on.
1.0,Poor quality  and the size was not an adult size  type of lanyard to go around the neck there is no safety release  and the screen  silk screen printing is very poor is wish it was more heavy duty. Not recommended for mature men in our fraternity.
1.0,It does not fit as described. I have an average size adult head. It fit my 3rd grader perfect and is adorable on her
1.0,"Would not buy again. I was going to gift these “state”key chains to people. But I was very disappointed when they arrived. This product is too small, cheap and flemsy to use on a key chain."
1.0,Too cheap looking. I wouldn't even want it for free. Have to return it.
1.0,"Wasn't impressed.  Seems stupid but I could not figure out how to wear it, way too confusing for what should be a simple swimsuit coverup!"
1.0,"No stars is more like! I purchased this because I like the color and the message. I washed it with all our laundry before I wore it (as I do all clothes I purchase) it went into the wash a 2x and it came out a size large. I didn't return I just decided to use it as a sleep tshirt (mind you I'd never spend $15 on a shirt just to sleep in it). So I won't be ordering the other colors which was my plan, so disappointing!"
1.0,Doesn’t do well under my “hard hat”
1.0,The snap broke the first time I snapped and snapped off
1.0,Too long and I look like wearing my grandma's dress.
1.0,Bracelet is junk. So small woukd barely fit a childs wrist. It was broken on one end when i opened it. Junk junk<br />Please issue my refund and i will return at your expense.
1.0,"The tooth was waaaaay too big, almost like an XXXL size."
1.0,"Disappointed in the fit. The pattern is cute as is the material print selection, but it just doesn't fit right, and I'm pretty easy to fit. Oh well - I returned it."
1.0,"I understand for the price I was not going to get something high quality, but this material is terrible.  Save yourself the money and get something at TJ Max or Ross."
1.0,"I had to return this top. It said to order a size larger because they are made for Asian market. I could have ordered a size smaller. I am short, but overweight."
1.0,Product was poorly printed
1.0,This robe didn’t fit around my bust. If you have anything bigger than a double a bra size this won’t fit you.
1.0,It fits horibly.. it looks like a design disaster
1.0,Plastic broke after 3 wears. Did not last long.
1.0,The light stopped working less than a week.
1.0,Its so cheap and unflattering.
1.0,Absolutely nothing like the picture. Small hat. Not as described.
1.0,Runs small.  Looks cheap.
1.0,Very disappointed about the sizing
1.0,I would like to return this item olease
1.0,"If I can give zero stars... is how this review is going to start. Being that said, you should know how this review is going to end... and trust me it’s not going to end well. It was super cute. My daughter loved it, until the 3rd time she used it, the metal brackets started falling apart. So glad it didn’t poke her in the eye!"
1.0,Very cheap pants and huge period gave away to my 7 month pregnant cousin.
1.0,Style not as described. Saw the bad reviews but thought I'd try it out myself. Should of went with the reviews. Returned it immediately.
1.0,Looks great at first but know it fits small and falls apart after 3 or 4 wears.  Quality doesn't match the price point.  Save your time and money and get something more durable if you plan on doing any real workouts in these.
1.0,The dress didn't fit me. It was the right size in the shoulders but it was just to big everywhere else. I couldn't size down because they didn't have an extra small. I also wasn't impressed by the quality of the fabric. I loved the pattern but since the dress didn't fit I ended up sending it back.
1.0,It's very beautiful and was just what I wanted. Couldn't wait to wear it. After a couple hours the stone fell out onto the table at dinner. So embarrassing.
1.0,Not cute
1.0,"This fabric is not modal. Modal is a type of rayon. This is polyester. I cannot wear polyester shirts when I'm working out, much less the type that catches on my finger tip skin. I'm returning as soon as possible. Very disappointed to have been misled."
1.0,Too short length in trunk and arm!! Loved the warm fuzzy inside lining And thumb holes! Whis it was longer would have kept it!
1.0,Product too small if you want 2xl  you might want to order 4xl cause it was way too tight
1.0,Not sure how anyone could use this as a scrub hat. It is made of a thin lightweight fabric and doesn't have the inner lining like other scrub hats. A small inner lining makes the difference as this scrub hat wouldn't stay put and came off my head easily. One would need bobby pins to keep it in place. Basically this an overpriced scarf. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Falling apart almost immediately. Impossible to get on because the different components of the sock are basically separate with some regular, weak stitching."
1.0,Wore them once and the silver pin that keeps the clasp connected fell out.  I now have a useless shirt stay.
1.0,Terrible ...washed first to get rid of the hard stiffness..that didnt work! No tags of any kind inside showing what it's made of..or size...couldn't even tell front from back on bottoms as pockets were sewn in backwards..waste of my birthday gift card!
1.0,Our of the box they seemed good quality. For nice. The first time you wash them. They shrink now they’re the perfect size for a child
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Beware. This dress runs way too small. It’s more like a child’s XL!
1.0,Fits nice.  Not same design in photo.  Disappointing.
1.0,"It is very annoying, especially irritated me neck is very rough"
1.0,Doesn't fit well as bracelet or necklace
1.0,"I hated it!!! I gave it away..... looks nothing like the picture... and I have a hour glass figure!!! It’s like around the waste I had to hide material under the belt cause it’s just to much material... I ordered XL ... the arms of the shirt just not it, upper body fit<br />Just to much material for the look they say u will get"
1.0,Very disappointed. Ordered this for my kid’s graduation photo shoot but it only came with cap and gown. Not as described the 4 items! Now I don’t even know if I have time to order new ones!
1.0,"Did not look at all as advertised and I truly question the 60 % cotton claim. Looks totally cheap, very disappointed I returned it."
1.0,Clingy
1.0,"I was so excited for this shirt to come.. So disappointed, the material looks nothing like its pictured. Its actually a polyester shiny material . The fit isn’t great. It’s pictured very loose but its not that at all…"
1.0,It's the right size but its not leak proof cause it gets wet when regular ice is used n too heavy when filled with cans. This is only useful when ice  packs n food is put in it no cans or bottles.
1.0,Smaller than anticipated.  Material way too flimsy and sheer for my liking
1.0,Very cute but came with a few of the pieces already broken off.
1.0,Barely used and the boots and soles have failed. Holes on the soles of both boots. Used less than 20 times.
1.0,Broke when removing out of the packaging
1.0,"The sizing is off, the backs of the “eyes” scratch the skin, and the shape of the shoe causes major tripping. They are also quite obviously made with cheap materials, more like what you would expect from from a Halloween costume to be worn for a short period of time - definitely not a full school day. I do not recommend these."
1.0,Completely bad quality and see through
1.0,"The material was very thin and stretchy. I'm 5'2"", 100 lbs and the small was way too big."
1.0,I think it will look better if you’re shaped like a ruler. But it’s very unflattering ;I looked like a bag of potatoes.. I wear it at home as lounge wear. Shorter than expected too.
1.0,They don't keep your feet warm at all.  They're too thin and actually kept my feet<br />Cold.  I even had a pair of thick socks on over them.  I don't recommend them.
1.0,Shorts are way to short.  Length nothing like pic.
1.0,"I received the stem of this item broken above the curved handle. I know it was not Amazon's fault. The stem is extremely thin, and would be worth about 5 bucks and last maybe 1 or 2 uses if received undamaged. Don't bother..."
1.0,Cute boots and comfy but they are not waterproof at all. My lil one was driving through puddles yesterday with boots and socks soaking wet!
1.0,Cheap material hole in shirt
1.0,"I ordered the pictured &#34;Money Clip Wallet&#34;. The one I received opened like a regular wallet for bills. The label / bar code / description on product had right info, just wrong item in box. Stock needs to be checked for correct items in boxes as described!"
1.0,I could not even try it on! It was broken when it got sent!
1.0,These pants are awful. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,I wore these one day and they started coming apart at the seams in the crotch area.  A total waste of money.
1.0,"Thin, inexpensive material.  Sizes weren't even close."
1.0,Horrible it was fun but then 2 daud later it was pure black snd stained  so dont buy not good
1.0,It's not a blue light blocker
1.0,"Tooo tight, too small, won't buy again"
1.0,IT SMELLS BAD
1.0,Broke within a day.
1.0,Received today...4 were broken...Poor quality control! First and last time buyer...
1.0,Product had potential until it lost all of its shine/color during the first two days I've worn it.
1.0,Came apart 1 week after I got it. I got it as a gift for my husband. Disappointed.
1.0,didi not fit my wallet
1.0,This is how the product was delivered.
1.0,HORRIBLE!!! Too long and bad quality
1.0,WAY WAYYYYYY TOOOOOO SMALL. UNHAPPY AND RETURNED. NEVER HAVE HAD GOOD PURSE PURCHASE ON AMAZON. CHEAP QUALITY OR INCORRECT DISCRIMINATION.
1.0,Its pretty but arrived broken. I fixed it but it broke again within a few days.
1.0,You would be better off finding a higher quality outfit at a Halloween costume store
1.0,The dress looks nothing like the picture.  Imagine a long rectangular bag with added sleeves.  Its like a bag.  The colour is correct.
1.0,I'm a DD and they would not hold me in place. Started dealing off before I could even get my dress on. So bummed.
1.0,It's so tiny it goes through my piercing hole
1.0,"Edit 9-25-2017- After about three weeks the metal part where the Velcro goes through broke on one shoe. My kid is so disappointed! I either got a defective shoe or I got what I paid for! Either way, there is no place to contact seller for a refund or exchange.<br /><br />First review: My son loves these shoes! He is 8 and says these are very comfortable!"
1.0,"I like that I get a bunch of different colors but it’s hard to bend the ring to open up to put in your nose , plus the hoop isn’t that big so it’s uncomfortable to wear , and I have a small nose .. couldn’t imagine having a larger or wider nose wearing this .. the hoop should be a lot bigger . The quantity is better than the quality on these . Not worth the money tbh"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:cd958980a157afb8294eb93ffd767648]] One star for appearance and warmth. The 'grip' is plastic and any thing you touch or try to hold is EXTRA SLIPPERY.<br /> I almost had a car accident because the steering wheel repeatedly slipped while I was trying to make a turn ... no matter how tight I tried to grip (see video uploaded - hopefully the loud sound from the 'plastic' sliding on the leather stirring wheel can be heard). I literally had to take the gloves off.  the touch screen feature only works occasionally. Although the lining is nice and warm, it 'bunches' badly in fingers making an otherwise perfect fit glove very uncomfortable.  Had to return."
1.0,"I have liked this affordable shirt and this is my third. However, this purchase arrived in a crumpled ball in the bottom of the bag and without the tag.  I assume I'm not the first person to receive this shirt. I will not return it as I'm staying home due to the virus."
1.0,"Pants are supposed to be 100% linen as advertised however, after ordering and receiving them I noticed they are not what so ever. Very disappointed I don’t even want them anymore because I only wear pure linen. Don’t waste your money if you want real quality and not a blend. Total waste of money!!"
1.0,I returned the original item for a replacement and received the same garbage. Non of the clasp works!! Don’t waste your time!
1.0,It was not what I yhought it would be. to smallnot what I thought. It was to small.
1.0,Save your money. Poorly made
1.0,"I gave this to my wife for her birthday. She wore it to work. She works in an office so no manual labor. By the time she got home that night, 3 stones had fallen out. This review is not directed so much at the crummy product but at Amazon. Buyers rely on Amazon to maintain quality in the products offered. Unfortunately this is the second product in two months that I bought from Amazon that turned out to be junk. Buyer beware."
1.0,"This is a cheap knock off product.  There is no image on the back,  it's not an officially licensed product and the image on the front is crooked. Don't buy it!"
1.0,You get what you pay for. 80% of the charms I've bought from this brand have broken.
1.0,"The color was not as expected--calling the color in the photo yellow was already a huge stretch, and it wasn't even that yellow. Then the shape--I looked way too much like an actual sack of potatoes. It's a no from me."
1.0,"Did not come with the complete box. The ferrari/rayban cleaning cloth was not included, no proof of authenticity and the temples were really loose"
1.0,Too short. I’m 5”10. Dress was above my ankle & the more I pulled it down the back came down to my butt crack. I took the loss & threw it out.
1.0,Used a couple of months and the zipper is broken already. All I put in it is a clipboard
1.0,"Terrible quality fabric, it doesn't even fit well, it is too small. I bought a medium but it fits like an extra small.It is also too short, I am 5'6 and it has an awkward length on me.ugh"
1.0,"These are really small - too small for my 6-year-old, and the lens was scratched upon arrival.  Also - they do not appear very durable or kid proof."
1.0,color runs
1.0,They are nicely padded but the legs creep up so bad they were uncomfortable for my daughter. I ended up just spending the money to get her ones with grippers on the legs. I should have just done that to begin with.
1.0,"Not as good as the older ones that I have.  I bought these for my husband because he really liked mine.  They are not made the same way.  The<br />frames are really poorly made and the lenses stain and are very hard to clean.  Would not buy again.  Do not recommend.  There are better glasses for less money.  Also, they are not polarized."
1.0,This fit like mediums and were more like booty shorts almost.  The material is heavy and nice but the fit is too small. And too short.
1.0,"Very cheap, poor quality.  Material is not sweatshirt material!  Runs small!"
1.0,Hate it..it's nothing like the pic
1.0,so ugly
1.0,I feel certain that the Dodge/Mopar patent or quality assurance was not consulted on this cap. The cap is fine but the logo is not embroidered on. It's not even ironed on. It's appears be cheap 20 bond paper probably glued on! I promise you they won't refund this. PPfft! Bag of Dung.
1.0,sunglasses will fall apart after approx. 10 uses. if youre ok with that buy it.
1.0,The material is awful! Soft but awful! It’s thin and wrinkled no matter how much you iron or steam it! Wore for a costume and was good for my time constraint but wish I had spent the money on a higher quality skirt I’d get more than one wear out of!
1.0,solo me llegó una correa y eran 5 o al menos eso decía lo que YO pedí aún sigo en la espera de las otras 4 que faltan
1.0,I liked the design and material.
1.0,"I put on the bodysuit and the material feels really cheap, like a garbage bag. Also I put on the belt and the gems fall off, they just hot glue the gems on, I could’ve made this costume myself. I will be returning it"
1.0,Get a size up. I’m so disappointed . I ordered a medium because I’m a medium in all other thrasher shirts. I need a large.
1.0,Belt wasn’t big enough not true to size
1.0,The top looks fine but it is way too small.  I ordered a size up and I could not even slip it on because it is so tight.  I'll be sending it back.
1.0,"These are more on the clear side, not so much solid white like I was looking for and how the picture indicates."
1.0,"These are just simple wires, not good for pressure at all. Stiff wire."
1.0,"I really liked the weight and style of the chain, but it was much too orange in color and looked super fake because of that."
1.0,"Sorta' don't get it.  They feel okay once they are on, but they are a PITA to get on and harder to get off.  I cannot recommend."
1.0,"This is just about the worst pair of boots I've ever owned;  a)  The soles of the boot wear out very quickly; b) The insides get wet very quickly in snow & rain; in other words, the seal between the sole & the leather is horrible, allowing water to seep in with the smallest exposure to external moisture; c) They stretch immensely over time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but understand that the boots will stretch to become at least a half size larger.  I do not understand the use value of these boots.  One would think they are supposed to be warm winter boots made to be used in all types of weather; they are not; essentially, they are overpriced slippers that can be used in dry winter weather to take-out the garbage or perhaps take the dog for a walk.  For this kind of money, I'd look elsewhere for a higher quality boot that can stand-up to winter weather like snow, sleet & rain."
1.0,"More comfortable than the OEM band.  Easy install.  Deduct one star: the band has twice popped off, neither time while active. Both times tracker fell close.  Easily popped back on and secure, but not sure why it occurred at all.<br /><br />** Reducing to 1 star **  After two months, band now pops off with the slightest wrist movement.  Drying hand with a bath towel now causing the band to pop.  Will buy the genuine bands.  Not worth saving a little $ to have my Fitbit beat up falling on the floor."
1.0,Super excited to try these less than a month in two have come apart. The lenses separated from the frames. Would not order again!
1.0,Sizing is definitely not for US!
1.0,This dress is not worth 5$. 1st off I ordered in two colors and I still havent received the second. I was told I received the other color I ordered. This dress is made of very uncomfortable material. There is too much of it. It's not lightweight like it appears in the photos. The top has two much fabric in the overlay. The underside is normal but the top should have been tighter. Had it been made of a stretchy material ( how it looks in the photos) maybe it would have worked but even so the top wasn't sewn properly because the back part of the dress is coming through the front/top. This dress is hideous.  I took pictures in a similar stylecheap dress I bought a while back that was 12$ to show how a normal dress should look.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:96db5a82a91498b8dd7b65dca93f98bf]] Not too big not too small, not too boring and not extravagant! These are perfect for any occasion!<br /><br />Update a few days later. They have tarnished already. And also I do not believe that these are true stones or gems they make a very plastic sound when you kind of touch them together I own some real stones at home and they don't make this noise that these do and like I said they changed colors within the first couple of days that I've had them it's only been about 3 or 4 days"
1.0,I was hoping to mix some less expensive jewelry with my expensive turquoise. Unfortunately this did not work. Just didn’t look good. Ring is smaller then I expected as well.
1.0,I need a replacement. The pictures of the cheetahs in all 3 pieces cut the ears off because the picture has been placed far off center.
1.0,"My belt just came apart into 2 pieces.  I bought this belt because it says ""One Piece""<br /><br />It is NOT ONE PIECE"
1.0,Kept sliding off her glasses
1.0,"Small on shoulders and shot, not like the picture."
1.0,Ironed it and the material left iron marks with low heat! I bought 10 dresses from this company I really hope all of them don't do this! I'm afraid to even iton any of them looks like I'll have to take them to dry cleaners and steam iron! Not happy😑
1.0,"I even took an extra step and bought a protective spray, still, by the end of the summer this umbrella faded terribly.  I don't expect much - typically you get what you pay for, however, I did expect it to at least last one full season.  Horrible quality."
1.0,I returned the device and the extra band the device did not work as advertised I received an e-mail from the MFG and they said they would send one to me free of charge with the new upgrades so  far no answer from them so there is no way I can recommend this device to anyone until they hold up their end of the suggested offer they made. I hope they get a chance to read this and will respond with a positive acttion
1.0,"I definitely liked the design and softness of the material. The problem was that it was too loose a fit for my face, like to large. For me, it did not have the protective fit that I hoped for."
1.0,These are NOT for wide feet and the sole is hard!!! Going to send them back!
1.0,To Small I Like Big Earrings
1.0,Don't bother.
1.0,"I didn’t like it at all. The cloth was too thin, it fit too small, and the “design” is really just a corner of fabric sewed on poorly on one of the bottom corners of the dress. Not worth it at all especially for $16. Anything over than 5 dollars for this dress is a rip off.<br />Edit: Their customer service is AWFUL!!!!!!! Worst I’ve ever had!! They need DESCRIPTIVE EXAMPLES of how the dress sucks. They seem to not understand the quality is just awful and the whole thing is overpriced.<br />Again: DONT BOTHER GETTING ANYTHING FROM THEM. They’ll just respond three Dayan later if you have an issue and not solve anything. Don’t waste your time. Horrible product and horrible customer service."
1.0,Adorable but they don't fit. I even ordered a size up.
1.0,"First off, the dress is about 3 sizes smaller than actual size.<br />Second, it has the tie up back like you see on so many prom dresses - not a zipper as advertised.<br />Third, this seller was very difficult to work with. The dress I bought was free returns, however, the seller wasn’t going to provide a shipping label until I asked for one. They also refunded only a fraction of my order even though it was supposed to be a full refund. Thank goodness Amazon backs purchases. After a couple weeks, I was finally able to get my full refund."
1.0,I put my hand in my pocket and the fabric tore! 3rd time wearing these pants and of course it’s past time to return them. Done with this brand!
1.0,"These look nothing like what is pictured.<br /><br />The ends are completely different, and I did not even get a rose gold/silver/rainbow ring like in the photo."
1.0,DIDN'T LIKE THE COLORS
1.0,They don't fit well and stick to your feet. Whatever you do don't get them wet as the colour comes out and then you leave black footprints all over the house!
1.0,Became way too small after washing in cold water no less. returned..
1.0,Such BS when you order something battery powered and it shows up DOA.
1.0,"It could have just been me, but I found these incredibly unflattering.  I am 5'3 and a size 4 so I realized that it could be my height that affects the look.  Very sad though.  Returning but beware~ you will have to pay the return shipping too."
1.0,Don't waste your money!!! 50% of these don't work!
1.0,Too big!!!! I order a small and fits like XL!!! Very unhappy
1.0,"In December 2018, I purchased a Fit Bit Versa watch for my wife with a peach colored band. The original band still looks great, but she wanted to try the pink sand color. After about 1 month of use, the pink sand band Ouwegaga Band seems to have lost it's color along the band edges. It looks ""dirty"". My wife tried to clean it with mild soap, without good results. I would not recommend this band to other Amazon shoppers."
1.0,I just used this for few times. Unfortunately 4 of the stone already came out and the beautiful blue stone is moving around and I don't feel comfortable to wear this anymore. I feel I wasted my money.
1.0,WAY TOO TIGHT!!!! AND ROLLS DOWN AS SOON AS YOU START TALKING!! WASTE OF MONEY!!
1.0,"These are TINY, the xl is basically a medium."
1.0,Cheap  wrong  color for me.
1.0,This product runs extremely SMALL!
1.0,"DO NOT TAKE THE WARNING LIGHTLY<br />Easily discolors after a few wears, even after trying to not get them wet at all. Really loved them until the color transfered onto my skin"
1.0,"The bracelets look just like the picture and are the perfect size for my toddlers' arms at 2.75&#34; in diameter, but I did NOT receive 12 bracelets as described. I only got 4. Even after refunding and reordering, I received another order of just 4 bracelets."
1.0,These are terrible quality! DO NOT BUY... the minute i put them on all the strings started coming off...just terrible ... buy a better brand on these ... NOT WORTH IT AT ALL
1.0,Arrived with hole in the pocket and a few months later the strap broke. Horrible quality. I was very disappointed.
1.0,I couldn't even enjoy these pants cause they arrived broken.  The material was disheveled and the whole crotch was torn.
1.0,"Sending back. Not cut well, cheaply made."
1.0,"I guess this was one of those should've looked at the review first . This item runs small , it's an odd shape and looks nothing like what you're wanting to order . If you want a t-shirt night gown like your grandma may wear that's too small in the chest , cut and  Sewn crooked then this item is just right . I have requested a refund ."
1.0,it lost its color and faded.  I only wore it once. Material looked like it has a stripe on half. I really fell in love with the fit and style . The color is the best.
1.0,Las  mangas demasiado anchas
1.0,Wasn't made the way it was shown in the picture!
1.0,"I can’t believe the reviews on here. I had majors issues with 3 out of 4 umbrellas I orders<br /><br />Out of 4 umbrellas<br />1 was the incorrect umbrella all together<br />1 came  with the box all damaged and incorrect color. It was most definitely a return of an opened item.<br />1 came damaged. The box was Completely open. Not even taped close. The hardware inside was opened and missing pieces. I can’t believe it was delivered.<br />1 came okay.<br /><br />This company has no quality control for what they are shipping out. I don’t expect perfection for $140, but I do expect not to get open damaged products and the incorrect products."
1.0,"The stitching arrived falling apart, the fabric isn't cut to correct length and over extends to adjoining fabrics. Feels like it would fall apart when putting this on. I am 5'8 150lb trying a small, not good for me.  This is more expensive then &#34;Tesla Men's Compression Baselayer Running Tights&#34; and much lower quality. Please avoid at all cost. There are much better compression tights out there."
1.0,"The picture makes it appear that it's larger than it is. My bad for not reading the size, but ""wand"" implies something you hold in your hand, not a cocktail stir."
1.0,very uncomfortable  and they're hard to attach to the mask..don't waste your money
1.0,This was a terribly cheap product. It came to us already broken. It was intended as a gift and when my daughter opened it it was already broken. I fixed it. She wore it once went to wear it again another part broke. I fixed it with a replacement piece from another necklace. She goes to wear it again it breaks in another area and then we gave up. Unfortunately my return period ended yesterday and I can't find how to contact seller so I guess I am stuck with it and will throw it in the trash. I at least need to write a review for others to not waste your money. This is a VERY cheap product and breaks constantly. I understand it was inexpensive but literally can't even be worn once.  If I could give 0 stars I would.
1.0,Does not fit anywhere near to size. The legs are NOT tapered.
1.0,To plastic looking. Returning.
1.0,I only received 2 colors instead of 3
1.0,Would not buy again.  This is the second time I have bought this item and it breaks each time after two weeks or so of use.
1.0,Looked horrible. Returned it the same day I received it.
1.0,"I am disappointed. This material is not good quality at all. This material fits and feels the same as buying a cheap, scratchy bath towel from the dollar store. It’s also completely see through where the flowers don’t cover, and is a body on dress; not free flowing and spring-like. I was super excited to wear it the same day it arrived and that was a major no go. Returning this item."
1.0,"Does not look like the pic. What I mean is that when wearing the mask, the nose portion doesn’t really look like a nose portion. People look at it and do not know it’s the bottom half of Jason’s hockey mask. Disappointed."
1.0,GROSS ITEM! Received a washed and returned sweatshirt that stunk of perfume and was covered with animal and human hair!!!!!
1.0,These earrings will not close....impossible.  I wrote the company and they suggested a way to fix the clasp.  Well...nothing works..... I damage my ears trying to get them to tightly close.  What a waste of money!  So sad....
1.0,"We all loved the watch and my son was obsessed with it the two weeks he had it. He wore it just about every day. The one star is for false advertisement. It is not water resistant.He went swimming with it once and it got foggy and didn't work. No, he did not push any keys. I put the watch in a rice bag for over a week and it ticks now, but it is still foggy and does not show any digital. He can barely read the time so he doesn't want to wear it. :("
1.0,I gave up on trying to adjust the time on this.  There is nothing that does anything when you push on or turn it and I can't pry it open with anything to get inside.  I should have returned it but was just too busy to deal with it.  It is useless with the wrong time.  I was not expecting high quality at this price so I won't complain about the look or feel of it.  I did expect it to be adjustable for accuracy.
1.0,I tried these and I am very disappointed because they don’t work like I thought it would. They stick but for only a few minutes it starts sliding out of place. No use at all
1.0,"At first glance, these appear to be heavy duty shirt stays. But alas they are not. The metal brackets DO NOT stay on your socks. They also will wear sores on your legs and discolor your skin throughout the day. Plus, after only a few wears, the metal brackets fall apart. I've gone through 2 pair in the last 3 months."
1.0,"Beautiful colors.  Fit is too small!<br />Don’t buy because the returned item has to be sent to China.  The vendor will tell you it’s too expensive to return.  So “give it to someone, sell it or they will only refund 20%.” How ridiculous!!"
1.0,Improper English
1.0,More like a dress than top
1.0,I ordered a L in U.S. and it fits like a s/m they run extremely small
1.0,Do you like “hammer pants”? Because that’s what these are.
1.0,Sweater looks great in pictures not so much in person. It is uneven and not flattering at all. I did return the next day.
1.0,"Upon opening the bracelet,  the magnetic clasp stayed where it was and the end of the bracelet pulled out of the clasp.  So, it's broken and  I can't wear it that way.  I want to return it.<br /><br />The replacement I received is okay to wear the class works but one of the beads does not stay in place it just rolls off to the side I might try some glue on it but I'm just done"
1.0,"I don't feel comfortable wearing these, the design is very off-putting."
1.0,Hooks did not match up
1.0,"First off, took about 5-6 weeks to receive this and it’s not AT ALL what I thought it would be.  It’s barely bigger than a coaster and not really made out of wood. It’s on plywood that is super super thin. The sign is nothing like a barnwood decorative sign. Total waste of money and the item is completely misleading. This is nothing that you would hang on your wall because it’s so junky. I NEVER would have ordered this had the picture actually looked like the product.  I am going to request a refund."
1.0,cheap looking and small good for a young girl
1.0,"POOR FABRIC AND FABRICATION, THIN....THREW IT AWAY!!"
1.0,The ones I received look nothing like the picture.
1.0,"This shirt... is a whole no no. The pictures are misleading. The shirt is super super short. It rises up in the back and the front is longer. It’s a one star because the material is very cheap looking. Even though it’s not an expensive shirt, it doesnt look like the picture at all. I bought it in large but I could definitely size down."
1.0,Dress is beautiful but fits way larger than expected.
1.0,"Big, bulky and not comfortable. I returned them."
1.0,Cute suit but probably because of the amount of polyester it doesn’t fit tight to the skin at under arms or legs.
1.0,Really bad quality and very disappointed
1.0,This is a small blanket with a slit and some fringes. Get a Dollar General $5 throw and make it yourself with a pair of scissors. Nothing like the picture shows. Save your money!
1.0,This shirt is so undersized. I ordered a 3X so it would be baggy. It fits my daughter who wears a medium. I understand all sizing isn't perfect but that is way off.
1.0,First strong gust of wind frame bent and rod snapped. Had it for 2 weeks.
1.0,I didn't receive my necklace just too pcs of rocks...
1.0,"I bought this a month ago. I loved the color and the style. Unfortunately, after only a month, the band has already broken. If you’re not going to wear it daily, I’m sure it’s fine, but as an every day wear, it won’t last."
1.0,"This ring was splendidly gorgeous, my husband bought for me for our anniversary and I wore it immediately, the next day I woke up and my whole finger was green!"
1.0,Not what I expected....too snall
1.0,What I ordered compared to what I received are completely different cuts. There was not even an option to choose the horrible high neck boxy cut dress that I received so it couldn’t be my mistake of choosing the wrong one. The material is extremely thin and cheap quality. The colors are dull and nothing like what is pictured.
1.0,"Started with the medium, very stiff feeling and very small. Ordered the large which appeared to look the same size. Will not be trying these again."
1.0,I got this product yesterday. It works but not great. First off it's more pink than red. Second it collects a lot of dust making it very cheap looking. Third the band that holds the band in place keeps sliding off and I have to constantly put the band back through. Fourth it is not truly reversible because you cannot remove the clasp. I really wanted to like this product but I don't. I will not be buying anything else from this company.
1.0,The product sent was completely not as advertised and was made in china. It felt cheap and not protective at all.
1.0,"These are total JUNK!  I wore the gold, starfish Ankle Bracelet for approximately 12 days before the finish was TOTALLY gone!  ""Made in China"", so I'm fearful of lead.  Save your money, these are JUNK!"
1.0,i wish I could give fewer than 1 star
1.0,I thought it would be much much longer. The legs go up to my mid calve
1.0,The description read that I would receive different colors from a picture showing bright colors.  I receive black black navy and grey.<br />One pair already fell apart.
1.0,I don't receive the label to return😌
1.0,"I wonder if I got a production sample because this feels and sounds like parachute material and I don't think anyone would want to wear it. Overall slightly big on me at my normal size but there is a modesty snap at the top of the v-neck that causes a gap if it's closed. The snap is really cheap and is completely sloppy looking - thread all over.  I really wanted this to be nice - I love the style. The sleeves are fun, the length is perfect. Totally not worth it though."
1.0,Terrible.
1.0,"LADIES PLEASE don't waste your time in purchasing this necklace. It looks so nice and beautiful in the picture.. once you see it you'll be suprised. its not even metal, its some cheap plastic, its too short. fits me good but makes me feel like im choking. dont buy, yes its really cute in the picture, but once in person you'll be very disappointed ."
1.0,"Too stiff, cut into nose and chin"
1.0,"Very large and cheaply made. The return policy ended a day after they were shipped...so technically no returns. Save your money, do not purchase."
1.0,Theres nothing to attach the gem to the actual lip ring stud …
1.0,"When I received the package it was open, looked like it had not been sealed closed and there was nothing in the package. Please refund me."
1.0,"Not at all attractive. In the image they make it look textured, and nicely faded and fitted. It is none of those. Black buttons, a cheap polyester material that won't fade no matter how often it's washed, and just an ugly print instead of texture. I've attached a photo. Returning."
1.0,"Loved these earrings in the pictures, but in person the stones are more of a carnation pink bordering on fuschia rather tHan the slightly berry color shown.  As a result they really look a lot cheaper in person.  I was excited to receive these when I bought and I have't worn once."
1.0,I was really looking forward to this dress. Unfortunately I did not expect the fabric to be so cheap and feel like a costume. So sad. Returned
1.0,"I am 4'11&#34;, 92 lbs, 23&#34; waist, 32&#34; bust, and 33&#34; hips. Everyone said this ran super small, but I got an xs anyway. It was huge. It looks like a pillow case. If you are curvy then you might like this product"
1.0,These were huge for my niece!! Very weird sizing
1.0,The cut is strange and looks like a blouse
1.0,"This is a very lightweight and inexpensive locket. I would not recommend it. I have would returned it but it was a gift for my granddaughter and I received it the day before her birthday. She liked it but I need to get a longer chain. Overall, not a good purchase and very disappointed."
1.0,poorly made<br />wastoo expensive for the quality of the material
1.0,Stopped working after 2 weeks. I returned it.
1.0,"Don’t buy these, they are not silk. Pretty bad polyester shorts. They are labeled silk but are not.  Go elsewhere."
1.0,"I don't even know where to begin. The product has a bad smell. I have broad shoulders, so I'm usually dealing with a jacket that is a little too small across the back, but this jacket won't stay on my shoulders. Also, the fabric is cheap and flimsy"
1.0,I’m missing a blue beret hat. The hats are cheaply made. You can see the superglue on top of the hats. Disappointed and wish I would’ve purchased the other brand.
1.0,Nice socks but they were described as navy but they are actually royal blue.
1.0,"As they say &#34;you get what your pay for&#34;. These earrings were cheap, even for Swarovski standards. I have seen Czs for half this price that are much nicer"
1.0,"Terrible, broken within weeks and also considering it said it was stainless steel it’s definitely not since it also infected my skin!!"
1.0,"These came very timely are beautiful. But... They were the wrong size 00gauge when I ordered 0gauge. So only one star because as much as I love them I can not wear them. Bummer!<br /><br />To be fair my last order was 5 stars. Beautiful plugs, arrived quickly, and the right size."
1.0,Extremely lightweight & cheap-feeling material. The fastening buckle on the shoulder strap broke in half the first time they were worn. We had to hold it together with wire. The straps slide through the length adjustment buckle and don't stay the length they are adjusted to. Worse than disposable because of the price.
1.0,"I'm a huge fan of into the AM, have tons of there shirts perfect fit, this is not true to size. All thete is to it"
1.0,What a joke it was short and wide ! Nothing like the pic. I'm sending it back. Will not be ordering any clothes on this site.
1.0,Fits nothing like you think.
1.0,Ok for the money have a glare
1.0,Poorly made. The staff strap broke the first time I wore them
1.0,"Looked cute, but never received the item"
1.0,Ummmm it was wayyyyyy too small even though I sized up . Be careful unless you’re a small or medium don’t buy
1.0,It Broke in two days
1.0,Color didn’t Match the picture and not an oversized tee
1.0,Arrived.  Very pretty.  Dead battery.  Returned.
1.0,Not made for a human arm. Too short to go up to the shoulder and roll up off the bicep to collect at the elbow. I returned them after purchase.
1.0,I WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STARS!!! I waited 3 weeks for this set to come in and when it finally did.. 1-it wasn’t packaged in its box. 2-ALL chains are made of cheap material and can snap with one light pull 3- when I opened the package ALL OF THE NECKLACES WERE BROKEN !!!!
1.0,Material is thin and not good quality
1.0,Horrible gloves the lining inside the gloves is the worst can't stay in place pull your hand our and out comes the lining as well.
1.0,"They DO NOT look like the picture, and they are very small."
1.0,"They might be pink but definitely NOT sized for a woman.  I always wear a size 9 and in some shoes, I need a 9 wide size.  This sandal will not stay on my feet - they are super, super wide.  Toe to heel they are fine."
1.0,Came with one lense popped out. Very dissapionted will be getting refund.
1.0,"No one in the world wears the sizes they provide. It's dumb as hell to make clothing that doesn't fit like all other clothing, and it doesn't cost more to have normal size charts. Will never buy clothes from there again."
1.0,Way to short!
1.0,Don't buy!! They broke within days.
1.0,Such a cute pattern but very cheap. I could have sized down yet while I was pulling the suit on it sounded like all the seams were ripping. Also the neck area around the zipper was very sharp and uncomfortable. Really bummed because it’s so pretty but not worth it.
1.0,Very poor product the material is stiff the pants are way too short the shirt is way too stiff and short I would not recommend gave it away immediately
1.0,The t-shirt in the photo is obviously a woman's fitted T but what I received was something that looked like a potato sac
1.0,Difficult to adjust. If you figure it out before you break it. Doesn't come with instructions and it doesn't size down enough for small wrists.
1.0,"Beware,  sizes run way smaller then listed. To return them you have to pay shipping witch costs as much as the item. Dont risk it."
1.0,"This was made so cheaply. All nylon, polyester doesn't stretch at all. Returning it."
1.0,The outfit was too tight and short. I’m 5’7 and 190lbs
1.0,I received my item 4 weeks after ordering but it was missing the vent clip. The magnet is not much use without it. I emailed the seller and have not received a reply.
1.0,Product was damaged.  And it runs super large! Don't buy!
1.0,"It wasnt good material, it was they type of material that when it stretches it doesn’t go back to its shape, because of that it doesn’t conform to curves and kinda looks like a trash bag. I also thought it was floor length but it was mid calf length."
1.0,"This was too small, smelled horrible and looked really cheap. Customer service has been horrible in the refund process. I paid almost $20 to ship it back to them, provided tracking to prove it was delivered to them on 12/2/2022 and they still won’t refund me my money. Now I am out $77 dollars on a dress I don’t even have in my possession. Do not buy from them. I am disappointed all around."
1.0,"sizing off.....couldnt  wear, too small for XL."
1.0,a small is way too big
1.0,Very tight around my feet. Not affective.
1.0,Definitely not a relaxed fit. Very small size. Button broke off very first try. Didn't even get to wear them.
1.0,Waaaayyyyy too small of a wrist band and I have small-medium wrist size. Could barely get that thing on
1.0,"the shirts i got were almost see-through, super cheap fabric, and were not to size"
1.0,"I was really excited for these glasses to arrive in the mail. When I received them, they were missing the left lense and it was no where to be foind in the package. I feel as though I wastes my money because I don't even know about how to get a replacement lense. I'm disappointed"
1.0,"NOT COTTON...ITEM IS  100% POLYESTER.  ILL FITTING, TOO LONG DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...I  ORDERED 2 OTHER DRESSES THAT NEVER ARRIVED...."
1.0,This purse is like a gumboot- super shiny plastic and not cute at all. The inside was good with lots of compartments but cheap looking. Would not recommend at all
1.0,It didn’t hold its shape. It’s too big. And it’s a polyester like fabric kinda shiny. Not what I was hoping for at all.
1.0,Too small sizing way off
1.0,Cute but came broken.
1.0,Moldy and not edible
1.0,"The shipping cost is almost the price of the dress. When the dress arrived it had a HORRIBLE smell when I opened the bag. I had to shower once I took it off. The length of the dress made me trip as I was trying it on. The cost of the dress, shipping, cleaners, and alteration was NOT worth it!!!"
1.0,The glass fell out with in two weeks.Very hard to return
1.0,"I ordered this shirt because i loved the style and colors. What showed up looks nothing like the advertisement. The picture I took actually makes it look a ton better than it does in person. The colors look to be screen printed on and are light. I didn't expect it to be the highest quality shirt at this price, but I at least expect it to be close to the picture. When I requested to return it I was told they were sorry it didn't fit. So they didn't bother to read what I wrote as my return has nothing to do with it fitting (I didn't even bother to try it on) I was told I could get a 20% refund and I had to pay to ship it back...ridiculous. Don't fall for it!"
1.0,Looks like a bath robe.
1.0,My Air Force son took it on a vacation one month after we got it and the zipper ripped out. We had to fly back rigging the zipper so it would stay closed. Unfortunately unable to return it because it was too late. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Came broken and bent. The baggies look like they have been through hell and back, I immediately returned it back into the bag and filed a refund. Steer clear or gamble your luck be better than mine."
1.0,This is not a good product at all! I could have made this myself.
1.0,"Pretty, but to big for earrings, arrived broken, had to be glued."
1.0,The plastic zipper broke within 3 months. The seam threads unsewed. Had to go to walmart and buy another winter coat. Very dissatisfied with quality. Especially for the price you pay.
1.0,Image was not centered on shirt.  Washed on gentle cycle with cold water.  Shrank at least a whole size or more.  I won’t be able to wear it.  Will give away.
1.0,"lace material  and  lining  of the dress was  stitched together,  so  the  dress  look  pretty  awkward on the  lower hip,  could not  stretch it out as  the  lace  material  was  so  very  delicate,  had  high hopes  of  wearing for  girls  night out,  oh well  guess  I  can  wear  for  Walmart shopping..so  very  disappointed.."
1.0,I wanted to love this key chain. It's really cute! But it constantly falls apart. I keep finding the charms in my purse or hearing them hit the ground. The little rings are giving out from being bent back into shape after about a month of use. This is way overpriced for something I have to keep fixing and may only get to even use for less for 2 months.
1.0,This dress was ridiculous gave it away
1.0,"It is impossible to take links out. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong so I had two other people try and they could not remove the links either. I then got on here to try and find a solution but it seems that a lot of people had the same issue. If anyone has figured out a way to do this, please let me know."
1.0,"Super lame that the description doesn’t say explicitly that these are clip on earrings. I thought maybe I missed it 🤷🏼‍♀️ But nope, read the description again and nothing saying clip on. Would have been fine had they been for pierced ears which is what I was looking for."
1.0,"Dollar tree has better quality masks. This one is falsely advertised, cheaply made, uncomfortable, awful chemical stench."
1.0,Very flimsy doesn’t stay on Velcro not strong not a good product at all
1.0,"Very cheaply made, strap broke within 2 weeks"
1.0,Looked dull and dark. Almost like a really dark grayish army green.
1.0,Cheap as hell..i wore it twice to work..and even worked with it..when dust got on it amd i washed it off with soap amd water than went to polish it..the link faded..not worth the money<br />Just spend  on a real braclet. You cam find a nice 8mm braclet on amaazon for 899-2000 depending on the weight you want.
1.0,I could not see right<br /> out of  them… the lens were messed up.
1.0,They looked nice but i wasnt able to see  wurh them. Everything was blurry and gave me a headache.
1.0,"In my opinion it runs extremely too small. I ordered a 1x and my sister who wears a medium could not even fit it. Also the material is lightweight, very cheap."
1.0,Las orejas nunca se pararon y asustada a los niños
1.0,It was broken and stones were missing. Very thin frame.
1.0,Had to give it 1 star since I really can't use it.  Only 1 side was attached for strap.  I really did like it and it's perfect size....now it's sold out 🙁
1.0,The watch cracked withon a week or so and than stopped working altogether from the contact with water. This was supposed to be a good quality water resist Casio watch - but turns out it is REALLY bad!!
1.0,"I have a very similar pair of lounge pants that feature the guardians of the galaxy that are also 100% polyester so I felt comfortable buying 2 of these in the same size. Unfortunately, I could not get these pants past my legs they were too small, there's no elastic in the waist like my Guardians lounge pants either. These pants were a good 2 sizes too small, I think if you wanted to buy a large you'd need to buy the 2X and if you wanted to buy an Xtra Large you're out of luck as 2X is as big as it goes. The size was very disappointing and I don't think I'll be buying any pants from ""Mad Engine"" ever again.<br /><br />Other than the size, the material is very thin and doesn't have any give at all, not what I'm used to in lounge pants. I'm not sure these pants would have lasted very long. My wife is going to hem the length and my kids are going to wear these around the house."
1.0,"I just got this from last week ,but really cheap material looks like swimming clothes y got it<br />very stained with deodorant.  don't buy it"
1.0,"I purchased these earrings to wear during a wedding weekend. The plan was to wear them at both the rehearsal dinner and the wedding. Sadly, when I returned to my hotel room after the rehearsal dinner, I noticed that one of the pearls had fallen off of the earring. This left me scrambling to find another pair in time for the wedding ceremony. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
1.0,Only had one tights inside the package
1.0,Sunglasses WERE awesome... Broke 3 days into my 7 day vacation at the beach. Good thing I brought another brand with me. Never again.
1.0,Ordered a yellow tie for a wedding for my husband.  It's the same 'yellow' of a padded envelope. Not bright like the picture
1.0,"Ordered the glasses for my husband. They were attractive, comfortable and light weight. He was able to use them less than one week before the broke. He kept them in the box when not in use. Very disappointed."
1.0,This was 4 times too small:(
1.0,"Wow -- this skirt is SO not-special. I was looking for something versatile and easy to fit. However it's really expensive for such an unremarkable, lightweight, poorly constructed garment. Sorry! (I hate to be negative -- but I would never recommend this to anyone!)"
1.0,"The place where the plastic met the strap on the wrist gave me a violent rash. I didn’t sweat, I didn’t wet my wrist, I followed all the precautions that I have been using the Apple Watch band for 2 years, and I have never encountered a problem."
1.0,I'm not a fan at all makes your boobs look weird.  I'm a 36D
1.0,Can I send it back? It's beautiful but made wrong. Does not stay on and does not look like the picture.
1.0,I didn't expect much being so cheap but wow... extremely disappointed.
1.0,"I wasn't satisfied with the fabric itself. The mediums fit baggy up top and tight on the legs, while the smalls are tight everywhere, lol."
1.0,"I had high hopes for these but after wearing them for only 30 minutes, the fabric at the knees are horribly stretched out. These pants do not retain their shape and are not flattering for the leg. I wish I could return these, but I am past my return window."
1.0,This dress was poorly made.  Strings hanging from everywhere and beads flying off every which way as soon as I tske it out of the bag. This dress looks cheap and was made with no special attention to stitching.  Terrible... Do not buy this dress!!!!
1.0,Awfully small! Order 2 sizes up!
1.0,these were not made to wear on anyone that is not under two or three. They are so small and the post is so thick that you only have 1/8 th inch in which to get them on your ears. Does not work!
1.0,One wash & this is how they look!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e66fc619014871bca9eff0e2514b15e]] Disappointed in the quality of the band.
1.0,"Fit fine, but the zipper broke the first time I ripped it up."
1.0,"I had polarized prescription glasses years ago and they really made a difference with reflected glare.  These glasses had pretty good reviews so I thought I would try them for night vision and driving in rain.  They made almost no difference when it comes to glare.  I stopped by the optical store and asked the optician how to tell if glasses were polarized.  He showed me by looking at the glare of off a window at an angle.  When you turn the glasses around, the intensity of the reflection should change.  There was no difference in the reflection intensity when these glasses were turned around.  He told me these were just tinted plastic like the cheap sunglasses.  Told me I could get the same thing at the dollar store for $1.  Stopped by the local dollar store and sure enough, same glasses for a dollar.<br /><br />So bottom line, what you are getting are nothing more than a pair of cheap yellow tinted, non polarized sunglasses.  The only value in the product is the nice box and cloth bag that comes with the glasses."
1.0,Turned ears green.  Won’t repurchse and wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,"Pretty bracelet, however it was too big, and not adjustable"
1.0,size for a small was the size of a medium...
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e880cfc8d4c722cd436033a7eba7e271]] The video is self explanatory.
1.0,"Didn't serve the purpose, too tiny and very low quality."
1.0,"The product is too small and the material is so cheap like plastic. The color is not the same as in picture, it is more of dark navy blue"
1.0,"these were horrible and i returned them.  First, they were sent in a bubble mailer but not mailed protected in any way otherwise.  Very thin and cheap, like a Halloween accessory type of cheap.  Tons of black marks on them like scuff marks all over the frames, bumpy parts and one section looked like  a piece of fuzz or hair was painted over.  Disgusting!  Not worth even 99 cents.  Better quality from a dollar store."
1.0,This item did not come new.  I opened the box to a jumbled mess seriously that’s not cool
1.0,This is not what i bought
1.0,"Well this dress does look adorable, it contains a material that one would refer to as flimsy. Also if you are rather large chested, you will look ridiculous as the way it is cut for the body will not be flattering whatsoever."
1.0,Do not waste your time or money. Item shipped was a string triangle bikini no where near the item description or picture being shown.
1.0,"Wow! I bought this costume last year and LOVED IT! Not only was is completely inappropriate and offensive -- it fit really well too! J/K. We want this costume taken down!<br />I thought wearing this costume would boil an entire culture down to a racist stereotype. And I was right: Turns out, I was representing the culture in a super inaccurate and unflattering way! We want this costume taken down!<br />The best news: I wore the costume on Halloween to be funny. Then the next day I took it off, and I was just me again. Isn't it awesome that I didn't have to deal with the racism or oppression some people actually experience on a daily basis? Best Halloween ever! LOL BUT SERIOUSLY: take the costume down."
1.0,BROKE
1.0,Felt like I was looking through a bubble-eye lens.  Distortion on the edges.  The area of mid-focus was almost non-existent.
1.0,"Based on the sizes and measurements provided, I figured I would fit into the 2XL, but I couldn't even get it around my thigh.  I tried stretching the fabric, but nothing worked.  The boning is hard; but I can't tell you how comfortable it would be on, since I never got to actually wear it."
1.0,The picture is deceiving... It is 1 strap. They show a pack of different colored ones.
1.0,"These gloves arrived and they appeared to be worn…seams opened, all pulled, loose strings etc and the quality is a joke!!"
1.0,Don't work as expected and are not countable
1.0,Very disappointed with fit. Size I ordered was 2 or 3 sizes to small for what I ordered. Don't how they measure their cuts
1.0,"Worse Amazon purchase ever! The 'sports bra' is not a sports bra at all. This is just material attached to a blousey tank top. No support, no true design just awkwardly shaped piece of material."
1.0,Broke before I could effectively wear them. They are very cheap.
1.0,Frame broke when I put them on! Cheap plastic junk! Never again!
1.0,The leggings were to small. I'm not sure if it's because of the lining. The quality was nice.
1.0,The hour hand is off and it is impossible to set the time correct! I would not recommend this to anyone! Extremely frustrating and poorly made.<br /><br />*EDIT: I was emailed by them and they offered me an exchange or a refund so the service I would give 5 stars. Still waiting on the new replacement and hopefully this one will keep proper time 🙏🏻<br /><br />**EDIT(2)<br />The watch was replaced and the new one works perfect for a DAY. Then it broke again. DEFINITELY DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,It came in with a cute lil package then I tried to put one on it fall out tried the next one fall out it can’t never stay in place
1.0,Can't get it to stay on my ear
1.0,Way to slim and tight fitting
1.0,"Pearls keep falling off and I barely purchased it, not satisfied, it's very beautiful just hard to wear when the pearls fall out of nowhere."
1.0,It was unable to keep my fingers warm in 40°F. It kept freezing...
1.0,You can either get this from the carnival or a bubble gum machine or the dollar store.  What?!
1.0,"Item I received is NOT as pictured! The &#34;gold&#34; piece that the cat hangs from is thick and looks solid in the picture.The one I received is thin and looks like it came out of a bubble gum machine. But then, for $2.19, I guess I got what I paid for: JUNK!"
1.0,"Once I got it over my head, it was way too small. I ordered the 2xl I have a 38C chest, and it was way too tight."
1.0,"Sizing chart is not at all accurate. I went up to an XL and it fits like a M, maybe even smaller."
1.0,Don’t waste your money. This necklace tarnished within 2 weeks. Would not recommend.
1.0,First order received:  hook broke as soon as I tried putting it on; just because it is inexpensive doesn't mean it should be so cheaply made!  Ordered another:  same thing happened.  Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,I had no idea that I would need a jeweler's loupe o see thing.  Will be returning the item.
1.0,You get what you pay for. This skirt was a complete joke. My daughter wouldn't even wear it. Take some elastic and sew some tulle on. That's it. It's uneven. The waist is turned. Would NEVER buy from again.
1.0,"Nine peace wore it fo a a while until the metal attachments bent,? I’ve had victori secret bra that hve lasted for years. If you are looking for a long lasting bra this is not a good choice."
1.0,Not what l expected.
1.0,it doesn’t go past your hips. Really cheap material. Average size fit
1.0,I ordered this skirt in my normal size and it was way too tight.  I had to send it back.  I ordered the same one in the teal in the same size and it fit fine.  It would have been a cute skirt but it dug in my waist to the point of being very uncomfortable.  I don't know if the size was mismarked or it was cut wrong.  The waistband between the teal and this one was off about 2 inches.  Very inconsistent sizing.  I ordered a white one which I am still waiting for so I hope I don't have to send that one back too.
1.0,"It gets 1 star because it does do what it says. Showed up in a nice box with extra clasps, but that’s where the good news stops. Bad news: showed up severely tarnished with a black finger print on one end that can’t be cleaned off. It has the 925 stamp on it, but I’m pretty sure it’s not full Sterling, but plated. I have a 925 Sterling item that is 15 yrs old and has never tarnished like this. And at this price and for how small it is, it should be full Sterling. There needs to be more transparency about the actual metal as some people have allergies and if the plating wears off, someone could have a bad reaction. Ultimately, I’d say look for other options. This one is not great."
1.0,"Sizing is way off!  Ordered a 2XL for myself because I usually wear a XL but like them baggy and with dryer shrinkage I figured it would last me a while.  Fabric quality is decent so I gave them to my nephew who wears a L.  Would not purchase again, beware!"
1.0,Looks really cheap in person. Scratched immediately.
1.0,Ordered 17mm band - what was received was NOT 17mm; no marking on band but was NOT 17mm; more like 18mm. Do not recommend ordering 17mm band.
1.0,the fabric was extremely poor
1.0,Very bad quality in all 4 helmets
1.0,Came in WAY WAY to big
1.0,"It’s nice but I have big bones and this band is to small for me, so I’ll return it"
1.0,Good thing I don’t plan on wearing this in public.  The shirt is 3 different pieces of material sewn together very poorly. In the back the stripes are crooked and run up hill. The material is very thin.  You what you pay for.  A small price for a crappy product.
1.0,Followed the instructions and still was misshaped metal is way to soft.
1.0,"When mine arrived, the glass was cloudy and cracked. Inside didn't look like dandelion seeds, but a spider's egg sac. I plan on throwing away the glass bulb and keeping the chain. It wasn't worth it."
1.0,I have a large foot (9 1/2 female) and these socks are huge on me! They also don't feel any different than any regular pair of socks.
1.0,Wouldn’t cut through fabric only paper
1.0,Received the white shorts ripped. Also it's see-through.
1.0,The edges of the band are so rough it snags on everything. Ruined the cuff of two sleeves and pulled strings out of sweaters. Sent 1st one back hoping it was just a bad band but replacement is just as bad.
1.0,First time we wore them they got holes in the bottom. On all 3 pairs I bought.
1.0,The dress is not white! It’s ivory or cream color.... as well as see through!
1.0,The dress clearly stated and pictured as a green dress. I recieved a blue and silver dress. If I wanted a blue dress I would've order a blue dress. Bait and switch/ false advertising whatever you call it. Very disappointed.
1.0,Not warm at all.
1.0,I ordered more than one for a wedding. They were all different colors. Some of the backs were brown some of them was blue. Some of the buttons were falling off and one was missing a button. They were also 2 sizes too small.
1.0,"With all the great reviews I didn't hesitate to buy this dress. When it arrived, it had a horrible chemical smell. After it aired out, it was way too small on my daughter and is not the teal color pictured. The top and skirt are totally different colors of green and blue.It's very poorly made as well, with the stitching running on and off the seam line of the skirt."
1.0,"This is a product where you get what you paid.  Fabric cheesy, extremely large, will have to sew for size adjustment or just throw it in the trash.  Also came from China and took weeks to arrive.  Do not buy."
1.0,"The jump ring usnt strong enough, gets caught on stuff and has pulled to mishaped."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:971d76b33ce8a09aca1678a44765e81c]] Watch band plating came off onto my wrist within 24 hours of the very first time i wore it!!!<br />Also, the second hand was not working right out of the box. I did contact the seller immediately when i first recieved the watch, but then nearly 3 weeks later after they promised me a replacement i got tired of waiting and tried the watch on. 24 hours later the plating flaked off and onto my wrist!!!??<br />Watch the video and look at the pics and you'll agree. It's a crappy watch and that's it. Period.<br />To be fair, i could return the watch within the specified time allowed but that wouldn't make this watch any better."
1.0,Was cheap looking. Had a plastic look to the faux leather.
1.0,"The pants are SO much shorter than they appear in the picture.  I'm only 5'6&#34; and they barely touch my ankle.  I'm severely disappointed but don't want to have to return Yet Another item to Amazon.  If you want what's pictured, don't bother here<br /><br />EDIT:  Forget it, they're going back.  Tried wearing them and the too short pants started riding up Even More walking 5ft because the material is so much lighter than the pic would also have you believe.  Just not happy with these at all"
1.0,The flowers broke off of both pairs with the first use.
1.0,single use product
1.0,It would have been super cute but it came without tags and the front Hem was ripped out. I can't believe they shipped it.
1.0,Can’t say these pads made a big difference
1.0,Too big for a average earlobe.
1.0,"I was very excited for these and ended up very disappointed when they arrived. I have ordered many times from Turquoise Network and have always been satisfied. The craftsmanship is wonderful and they were delivered quickly, but unfortunately, these earrings arrived scratched and extremely heavily tarnished. Additionally, the silver on the backings of the earrings has completely peeled off. These were obviously pre-owned! I'm returning :("
1.0,Bestido
1.0,To large and wasn’t made correctly came damaged
1.0,Do not buy these pants unless you want to waste your money because they are completely see through! I bought 2 pair on a lighting deal only to be sadly disappointed when they arrived and cant be worn because they are so thin you can literally see everything under them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,much brighter (cheaper) color orange and the fit is nothing like pictured. I missed the return date by two days or I would have returned it.
1.0,So uncomfortable even for packing it
1.0,"It has a tear in it and the dye is missed on the fabric.  I would send a picture,  but I dont want you to have access to my phone camera and files"
1.0,"I purchased these to attach to a pair of prescription blue light blocker glasses. I have not been able to find blue light blocker reading glasses, so I thought this might work. I don't know if it is the film used for the blue light blocker, but these simply would not stick. They would immediately lift and fall off. I am sadly returning them."
1.0,They fit awful!! Water pours in.<br />Spent the whole time swimming trying to get it to stop. Would love to return but just got warm enough to try them and missed my 30 day window of return.
1.0,fell apart after a month
1.0,"The pink advertised is more fuchsia, but in person it looks neon pink almost orange!"
1.0,"I love the fit of these pants. However, the fabric is noisy when you walk - very annoying"
1.0,Fits as expected but the white option is completely see through.
1.0,"This bag is advertised as being able to accommodate a 14 inch laptop, but my Lenovo T400, which measures only 13 inches in width, is way too wide to fit. The only reason that I am not returning it is that my smaller Lenovo X301, which is a bit smaller than the T400., will barely fit. Knowing what I know now, I would not recomment this bag for anyone who has a laptop more than about 12 inches."
1.0,"The stones were out, and hooks of the earrings are broken and the way it was delivered was not good."
1.0,Too small and cheaply made iron on logo
1.0,Not even the same dress was sent. The one I got had sleeves
1.0,"Don't let the photoshopped images fool you. These masks may look good on a shelf. But, they are not big enough to fit an adult face... despite what the pictures may lead you to believe."
1.0,Extremely big.  Looks terrible like a dumpy billowing short.
1.0,Garbage shoes!!!!
1.0,It is a cute little hat. A bit small. But I’m very disappointed that there is no ghost. there is a wire for one but it’s not there.
1.0,Belt doesn’t latch. Waste of mkneh
1.0,"Watch band arrived in the worst packaging ever. No box, just curled up in an old plastic bag. The band was a pretty blue but obviously defective; parts of the mesh strap and parts of the magnet had grey metal showing through where the paint (?) had worn off or had not been fully covered."
1.0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers that said this leaks!  I have ordered directly from Bubba before and been very happy with my purchases, but I needed this quickly and it was marked as Prime, so I ordered it.<br /><br />Do NOT waste your money on this.  I also highly recommend ordering directly from the company.  They stand behind their product, whereas Amazon only gives you 30 days."
1.0,I bought this because it was super cute and I am a teacher for elementary school children. The Best quality and after using it only two days it broke apart and could not be fixed.
1.0,"I ordered these exact glasses two years ago, and they finally broke after much abuse.  They were great.  I ordered these replacements (2 pairs).  The page shows a +1.00, but these are in fact not lenses... they have no magnification at all.  Also, they don't have a return policy, so I'm stuck with reading glasses that aren't reading glasses.  Additionally, the picture (which is of my old glasses) didn't match the new glasses."
1.0,Dont waste your time and money. Just use a sponge. seriously
1.0,"This was the most uncomfortable, ineffective bra I have ever used.  Extremely disappointed"
1.0,It broke in less than an hour of my daughter giving it to her friend.
1.0,The lense is not original.<br />Bad quality finishing
1.0,"Look and feel of junk. Wouldn't wear it, and too much trouble to return. Very disappointed."
1.0,It broke the second I took it out of the box. I went to change the time and the dial broke. It was a birthday present for my son. So disappointed
1.0,"This is the first time i got a piece of jewelry that comes in pieces.<br />The cuff links came without the stones.<br />For the money I would not buy, nor recommend anyone to get this."
1.0,Buyer beware!! Cute. But I washed this by hand and the face peeled off!!
1.0,The fabric is horrible
1.0,"It doesn’t work, perhaps needs battery.<br />I have not wear yet."
1.0,Color isn’t pink it’s clear poorly wrapped wire around ring
1.0,"The pictures make the glasses look nice. However, in reality they are cheap looking and worst than glasses sold at gas stations."
1.0,these were very cheaply made and broke soon after i bought them.
1.0,The shirt wasn’t printed correctly. The “dissent collar” is longer on one side up by the neck which makes it look cheap & poorly made.
1.0,"This swim suit was horrible the top which could not stay on my breast because of the fabric used very cheap, need elastic or snifters around the edge of the cloth for the top it would stay to the body and not slide off"
1.0,Waaayyy too small.
1.0,"Awful, wore it one time and had nothing in the pockets and it still ripped at the seam. I ordered two with the intention of buying more to have monogrammed for my daycare. I am glad I did a trial run before buying 100 of them."
1.0,cute idea but the wire bent very easily and they wouldn't stay on after one wearing.  Good thing they were cheap.  Would not buy again
1.0,They were cheap but look even cheaper
1.0,Terrible-- no liner and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Broke after only a few uses, also had a glare from the sun so it didnt really help me at all."
1.0,"They are two different shades of purple and look used, very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,I ordered a 3x because thats what size I normally wear and it fitted terrible.
1.0,Don't bother. Came out of the package looking like a rat's nest. I didn't answer about the size because I could't get it untangled enough to even put it on my head. Threw it away.
1.0,Horrible bra! Cup size is not right material is uncomfortable. I so waisted my money.
1.0,"product was to small, barely fit over my small head. And it was tight around my nose and neck. This was see through. If you are trying to use this to protect you from anything, think again.  Returned the same day it was delivered. Thats how bad it was. Dosen't look like pictures. Super thin fabric cheaply made ."
1.0,It’s a woman’s vest not men’s.
1.0,I thought this was baggy and unflattering.  The fabric was too thin to be warm and it was simply too baggy to be attractive.
1.0,It’s waaay to big and I need to exchange it
1.0,"Cheap material, you’re better off using a shoelace than these.....The seller also lied about their shipping time, they take 3-5 days"
1.0,Bad quality fabric!
1.0,Definitely misrepresentation!!
1.0,Horrible material.  Very thin.... and they fit huge.
1.0,Don't believe what they say about sizes. Always too small...
1.0,"The glass just broke and they fell right off my face only after having them for about a week. Not made very well, cheesy craftsmanship."
1.0,Very poor qauki
1.0,It is hard...rough material...I can’t believe it’s even called a dress...trash. Don’t order this.
1.0,Ripped ends of package
1.0,Fits great but the colors don't last
1.0,Very fake dress this is not the dress in the picture it is a mess big and short
1.0,"My son is built very small for his age. Although I ordered his regular size, they are a full 2 sizes too small. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Way too small. Made for a child if your child work rock gear. No instruction guide, etc. so you're left to figure out the clasp."
1.0,"Cheap about to fall apart I feel like they are going to break in my hand, I doubte that they are authentic most liky Chinese knock offs. Unless u have a head like Andre the giant then they won't even fit you; dont buy."
1.0,"I was disappointed with this item the most.  I loved the picture and it looked even better in person.  But, it was too tight across the chest and in the sleeves wear the black fabric and colorful fabric meet.  I ordered the largest size.  I gave it to my 11 year old niece who will wear it as a dress."
1.0,"Beautiful dress but it’s made for a very tall woman, even with a pair of heels this dress way way to long. You would need to be at least 6’ to wear this. 😕"
1.0,"Dress came with a big stain near the bottom. The back lacing isn’t enough to hold the front in place. The weight of the satin was fantastic and the pockets a great bonus. But unless you want to go topless, try another dress."
1.0,Cheaply made. Very thin material. No elastic or hem. Doesn't stay up when you use it as covid face cover. Looks like it was cut with scissors and left jagged to fray. No hem.
1.0,"Won’t fit my 6yo, my 10yo, and I’m 34yo and it won’t fit me. I’d want to return but I’m going to be considerate since we already tried them on and we don’t want the next customers to get a used item. I would have to try to sew them"
1.0,Kjh
1.0,"Horrible quality, definatly not secure. Got as a gift for my husbands Gear S2 to dress it up a bit and the same day i gave it to him, it literally kept falling off his wrist. The clasp on one side would not stay connected and by the 2nd day it completly detached. Luckily it happened at home and not out somewhere where he would have lost a $200 smart watch! Save the hassle, money and potentially losing the entire watch. Do not buy!"
1.0,The color is so weird. Looks cheap.
1.0,These are a great concept. However... I bought them for school (I’m a teacher). They just filled with condensation (which I was afraid of) to the point it drips on the inside. Gross! Great in theory but not actually helpful.
1.0,Was expecting some length to it it's really short nothing like the photo
1.0,"Do not buy if you are looking for a aesthetic necklace.<br /><br />Extremely light, material is very low quality.  Is gimmicky and costs nowhere near 28.00 (5.00 shipping).  For 30$, I’m extremely disappointed by this purchase."
1.0,"My son got these for Christmas and they are not his full-time shoes. However, they are already quite literally falling apart! How do I get a refund??"
1.0,"I purchased XL.  NO WAY were theses even close. I am 6'2&#34; and 235 lbs.  I couldn't even get 1 leg in!<br />Figured, maybe my son (who wears a medium) could fit in these. Even on him, they fit like yoga pants,<br />or pantyhose!!! Obviously, they were mislabeled at the factory.  This last purchase, I got 3 different pairs<br />of lounge pants. All have be inconsistently sized. Best to buy an item like this IN PERSON. Where you can<br />pick up, touch and actually SEE how they will fit. Waste of my time and money buying these."
1.0,No instructions came with it so after spending a long time trying to figure it out I tried to install it and it was terrible.
1.0,I realize I wasn't purchase a $1000.00 watch... I realize that. But the connecting link/snap broke the first day of me wearing it. Wasn't worth the purchase at all. I've attached a photo.
1.0,"It was return, not user friendly"
1.0,These are very pretty but not at all dainty. I absolutely could not wait for them to arrive. I've never been so disappointed when they did arrive. I noticed immediately they were very thick (gauge). They are twice as big as my normal jewelry not sure of the gauge but they are even to large to get in my ears which have standard holes. I actually traumatized my nose trying to making them go in because I wanted them soooo bad! So unless you have a large gauged nose piercing don't buy these 😕
1.0,"Runs small, not lined and looks cheap.  Not happy!"
1.0,It was more like an extra small than an extra large piece of crap do not buy one it sucked
1.0,These are ridiculous! Only one side?! My fault for not noticing. These are embarrassing!
1.0,Zipper came broken.  Not satisfied
1.0,Prompt delivery but smaller than expected and the pearl fell off of post on second time wearing!
1.0,Snag material . It's from China would not purchase !
1.0,Trying to bend the little tabs breaks them off. Useless
1.0,"Well there is not the right choice! This does not look as pictured and does not fit as expected, but not too big or small. I did not like the material either. I will be returning it."
1.0,Terrible. I'm 5'10&#34; and tightening the strap to it's smallest size is still to long for me to use it.
1.0,Do not buy nothing like the pictures very cheap ugly material and very long does not fit right anywhere on the body DONT BUY
1.0,Lo devolví muy pequeño
1.0,Not at all true to size
1.0,I ordered an 3xl. It's not even close.
1.0,The top sleeves and pants never stay at your wrist nor the ankles.  Always bunches up and very uncomfortable.  Terrible!
1.0,"Bought it and does not work. Not sure if the battery that comes with it is old or it just doesn't work. With the price they are charging, they should have better quality control!"
1.0,So small I felt it was cutting me in two. Threw it away.
1.0,The sandal it’s self it super cute ama the wedge idea doe kiddos is great for older girls but the latch broke easily off so my kids unable to use the now bad luck or badly made! Idk.
1.0,not plus size ar all
1.0,I wore it once and the blue gem fell apart.
1.0,This bag is cute but poorly made. The Velcro is sewn horizontal on the bag body and vertical on the flap. It doesn't even secure. Aggrevating!
1.0,Was an off brand and not delta
1.0,"It be pic I posted was the item in process of being superglued, I doubt it’ll work. So as soon as I went to unscrew the too it totally came out. Easily too."
1.0,"After 4 times wearing these, there is already a hole."
1.0,Clasp broken out of package. No return available.
1.0,I wish I would have measured my heels before wasting money on these. I bought them for myself and my 5 bridesmaids for my wedding. We did pictures on the golf course so I thought they'd be perfect but they only fit one girl's shoes. The rest of the heels were too thick or too thin to wear these. Be careful!
1.0,These slippers are so thin. They are not comfortable.
1.0,I can't say enough about how bad this watch is. Save your money.
1.0,Just flopped on me. No support whatsoever otherwise it is a beautiful dress.
1.0,I’m a solid medium and this would not even go over my head. The fabric is also kind of cheap feeling. Bummed because there were so many good reviews.
1.0,These don’t have the size dot inside and no packet. They aren’t authentic.  Even the inside tag is different than originals.
1.0,There was no box for me to check so I will say that this product was terribly hot!! My skin began to sweat within 2 minutes. I gave it away.
1.0,Nothing like advertised
1.0,They got discolored after a few weeks of wearing them
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. Huge rip off, do not buy"
1.0,It was more like a shirt than a dress
1.0,Pictures say it all. Not worth $50 in the slightest.
1.0,"I was so excited for this! But when I got them so dissapointing. As soon as I put on the bracket it broke, and the time Turner necklace snaged on my shirt and broke. I was heartbroken!"
1.0,"Poor Quality was broken when I opened the bag,"
1.0,It’s so pretty but the quality it’s not what I was expecting. Some parts are red and I just had wear it a couple times
1.0,"Purchased two different colors, both were wrong size and one had a hole."
1.0,For their cost they are very tiny. Hardly will be visible unless you have very short hair. I expected better/more especially for the money.<br />I'm not a happy customer right now and I really wanted grown up looking dog earrings if that isn't an oxymoron! 🥺
1.0,This wallet fell apart the first week that I used it. The &#34;leather&#34; in the corners started to chip away and now the rest is falling apart. It looks as if I have used it for years.
1.0,It’s a gamble if you receive the one you ordered<br />It’s a gamble if you receive a dress of good fabric<br />It’s a $$$ gamble when it shouldn’t be a gamble.
1.0,The jacket looked almost nothing like the photo. It was so short it doesn't even reach the top of my pants
1.0,The small petite I bought for my wife is about the size of a regular medium. Will be returning.
1.0,Says women’s xxl for more like l/xl
1.0,"They were very small and said they were 60% cotton, but were not."
1.0,Too small because I received 3 sizes smaller than what I actually ordered. The package said xxxl (which I ordered).. and I received a L. I originally ordered a larger size because the reviews claimed this ran small anyway. Huge waste of money.
1.0,I literally just got this 5 minutes ago and a gem already fell out. And now it looks absolutely ridiculous.
1.0,"My baby is 90th percentile for things but it still seemed a bit small for the size. Shoulders are boxy. Just, not very flattering."
1.0,I have no clue what body type this bodysuit was made for. I am 5'2 and 125 lbs. i ordered my usual small and when it arrived it was HUGE! it honestly was sized more like an XL. Sadly I had to return it.
1.0,What the heck?!  This is a see- through turtleneck!!!
1.0,I ordered this item size XL and paid for it as a replacement for size L that fitted too tie. The invoice read XL however the item  sticker read Large. No explanation for this discrepancy however the size I received as replacement fits better.
1.0,"Way too small and I bought 2 sizes bigger than my normal siize. Fabric is cute and lightweight,  perfect for summer"
1.0,"Cheap material, feels still and poorly made. Lace appliqués add to the stiffness of the garment. Very disappointed"
1.0,I was so excited to receive my bag! I rushed to open the box and when I opened the dust bag was sooooo disappointed!!! Immediately saw hinge was broken☹️<br />There was no way to get it to close all the way! Bag is nice but try different company.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT! I l
1.0,"I bought this for my stepdaughter before we go on vacation. Really disappointed I didn’t get the bottoms, now I have to send this back"
1.0,Does not fit on husbands glasses.  Slides off.
1.0,Just receive my Mary J Blige hoodie today. I was so excited but it came with something sticky on it.  So disappointed.
1.0,White was see through!
1.0,"The front tie on this Tee did not work for me. I was expecting this to be longer in the front and it barely came to my waist. The sleeves were also a little shorter then I expected.<br /><br />For reference: I am 5 foot 2, 155 and I ordered and XL."
1.0,This shoe grip only comes for one shoe like come un atleast the should of put for a pair of shoes not just a shoe first and last time buying lame kung shoe gril
1.0,does not work well. hard to open defeat the purpose of the click belt
1.0,Couldn’t figure out how to make the knotted front
1.0,Broke in half after wearing it on my bracelet 5 times.
1.0,Two of the flowers if these flip  flops fell as soon as I wore them first time
1.0,It is pretty but it looked like a shirt. It was so short.
1.0,I got this hat for my brother who was in the 173rd. I had gotten him one a few years back with the adjustable metal clasp and he loved it. This one shows it having the same metal clasp but it does not. The hat in the picture is not the hat you will receive. It is cheap junk and false advertising.
1.0,Eh.. didn't fit had to cut it . Disappointed a bit but eventually we made it work .
1.0,Well 1st off...: this is very sheer. Completely see thru. So its defn. Not a dress. Top with leggings maybe or bathing suit cover up.  Also i found it ran on smaller side. I am sending back
1.0,Quality of the metal is terrible! It looks really cheap when you get it not like the picture. I expected it to be smaller and it was quite large.
1.0,Dress is going to be returned. Maybe if you’re more shapely this dress will fit more like the picture.  It looks like a bad tent on me.
1.0,Fell apart after a week's worth of wear.
1.0,"Cute set, but it was very itchy everywhere there is a seam. Pass!"
1.0,"I took a chance on this romper because there were several positive reviews. Big mistake. Not only is the quality so poor that the seams are pulled and the stictching looks like it was done by a blind person or a broken machine, but I had to spend half of what I paid for it to ship it back for a return. Do not trust the positive reviews! Ok now convinced they are fake!"
1.0,The band is too flexible and the included pins are weak. The band popped off my watch twice in two days.
1.0,"Bought this as part of a costume for a steampunk party.  Upon arrival, it was not a costume shirt, but an oversized shirt,  that was extremely wrinkled.  I ordered a small, and it was way too big.  The fabric quality was hard quality similar to a table cloth, and itchy.  Was not pleased."
1.0,I purchase a large because I have a big bust and te top was still too small. The body was a lil big but with some adjustments a made it work. Had to give it away..... Do I give it a one star!
1.0,"If you narrow feet, not the shoe for you"
1.0,Horrible piece of junk! It broke in 7 days! So disappointed.
1.0,Low quality & loose arms
1.0,"Very poor quality, fraying edges, smelled bad"
1.0,"No tempered glass cover, a basic flimsy screen protector. Also the case is really flimsy which will definitely break and phone will be damaged. So a rubber cover will not fit over it incase you like the look."
1.0,"I have sensitive skin and I found the material to be itchy. I was expecting it to be softer based on reviews. To be fair, I also had this problem with a Woolx top which was admittedly softer than this one. I will be going with synthetic fabrics from now on."
1.0,This almost looks like it came from a sweatshop in China. The material was very cheap and thin. It reminded me of Halloween costume material. Not worth it.
1.0,Typical of this style of bangle.  I have had no problem with it.  The aquamarine is more like a blue topaz but it is prettier than the correct stone.<br />Changed rating after stone fell off the bracelet.  Have no idea where the charm is.  Gone and bracelet is worthless!
1.0,Too small for the large size I ordered
1.0,Plugs chipped and the emblems fell out rather quickly.
1.0,I was sent this pair of shoes without the necessary cleat nuts included in the shoe box. I am left without being able to attach cleats to these shoes...
1.0,when I received the package some  the pearls weren't even attached. since I spent only a cup od dollars didn't bother returning truly disappointing. won't over these again
1.0,I own three pairs of Shebeest from several years ago. They WERE previously Made In USA. They are NO longer Made In USA and the quality is DEPLORABLE. These are not the bike shorts I have purchased in the past. I had just recommended the brand to a friend and figured I'd order myself another pair--what a MISTAKE😳The arrived very cheaply packaged. I opened the box and pulled out the bike shorts thinking they sent the wrong pair. They were indeed Shebeest-- but the quality is so pathetic--I will not buy them again. The padding was minimal. The fabric was cheap. So sad to see a product that was a quality American made product become just another poorly constructed import.
1.0,"this product is extremely misleading claiming they are “surgical steel” when they are in fact made of NICKEL which is an extreme irritant to most skin types bc of the fake metal; it’s the equivalent to buying forever 21 earrings and your ears itching after an hour of wearing them. i had these for 2 days, took 1 shower and it already began to RUST and was infecting my piercing. definitely 100% do NOT recommend."
1.0,The top straps are not adjustable and are huge. I could fit my thumb width between my foot and the strap.
1.0,The picture of the dress and the actual dress is very different I returned this dress
1.0,"The elastic waistband was exposed, sections of it sticking out at the seam. The skirt had holes in it. Waste of money"
1.0,Pictures make it look like stainless steel- it is cheap black plastic and the majority of the compasses (I bought a dozen) are off by 30 degrees. Unfortunately I bought these for a presentation and do not have time to reorder! Buyers beware!
1.0,The charm fell off a few days after I gave it to her. Then less than a week after that the chain broke!! I’m highly unsatisfied!!!!
1.0,Was broken when I opened the bag it was in
1.0,The quality of this sweater is terrible.  Colors are too bright and yarn is very cheap.  The colors do not match the model.  There is no return receipt or information included.  Don't bother!!
1.0,Watch hands are a different style from the photos shown. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"I like the idea but the product is MUCH too small for a grown man.  The opening won't even fit over my husband's head.  It is probably a good product for a child.  But if you are a full sized adult, this won't do it for you.  Gave it away...."
1.0,The strap broke within an hour of wearing this dress the first time.  It can’t even be repaired because it frayed so much when it broke.  The wearer is not top heavy and was not dependent on the straps thankfully but if you’re blessed up top just know the straps do not stay together.
1.0,"This watch is poorly made and of low quality.  Within 2 weeks of buying, the handle &quot;clicks off.&quot; I was going to also buy they parking meter shaped watch as well, but after this, I will never buy anything from this company again and I suggest everybody do the same."
1.0,Liked the watch  but only work 2 days and won't charge or turn on
1.0,"I got this item for my twin boys. They’re both over 38 inches tall and weigh about 34lbs. This seesaw allows each side to go so high off the ground it’s impossible for my kids to use it without an adult to save them. There is NOTHING to moderate the speed each side rises and falls. So my kids literally took turns launching each other over the handlebars until I took it away. The ball underneath each seat needs to be MUCH bigger if it’s going to be advertised towards 3/4 year olds. This toy should be advertised towards 4/5/6 year olds, but with expectations  of a short life span"
1.0,"I liked the idea, but after a few months it appears where the hinges are attached - it came loose and it won't close.  Good idea but should last longer."
1.0,ordered an XL to make sure it would be long enough...... yeah fits like a small :( not happy!
1.0,Was supposed to be 3X but fits like med-large
1.0,Ordered a large and it’s a child’s large. Everyone laughed even me. I have it to the 8 year old next door and it’s small on her<br />Hahahaha
1.0,I bought a 2xl and it fits like a medium!! So sz up two sizes. Also feels really cheap.
1.0,It looks nice quality but mine arrived visibly used with deodorant marks. It also smelled like body odor. Not cool
1.0,"Very pretty BUT, NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO WRAP!!! Nothing but the long material<br />So where do I go to get ground school instructions"
1.0,not even super dark
1.0,Super poor quality. Literally sewed backwards.
1.0,I have had the Oakley Flak xlj POLARIZED Blue Ice lenses before.  After looking through them on my frames.  These are not the same as the Oakley polarized lenses at all.  Item returned.
1.0,Does not hold bug breast
1.0,"All 3 pairs fell apart. I bought an eyeglass kit and all of the screws were too small, so I couldn't fix them. For such a cheap price I didn't expect them to last long, but each pair only got about 1-3 wears before a screw falls out, because every time you move the temples the screw come out."
1.0,Too large. I ordered twice and still couldn’t get a proper size. I wanted 49in bust size so got size L but when measured it was 52in. Now third time I am ordering size M to find the proper size. Size chart is not accurate.
1.0,I have a Shiba Inu 17 pounds. He bit right through the fingers. I was trying to put drops in his eyes and he went nuts. So I went to get my gloves then that made crazier; he won the battle and my fingers got punchered. I felt I was going to be safe and got my ass kicked.
1.0,Cheaply made (to be expected at this price) but worst part was lettering was off-center and crooked. Took awhile for delivery and was underwhelmed when it arrived.
1.0,It arrived with a broken button.
1.0,This was supposed to be for family Christmas pictures today. Super disappointed. I've not even opened the packaging and you can see they are dirty or used or something. They were so pretty in the pictures I was excited to wear them. Waste of money.
1.0,When I bought to watch it was working  I wore yesterday and I did not work I reset it to time was wrong then is still do not work this is the 1st time ever wore just watch I want to return it
1.0,The chain fell apart before I managed to get it opened.  It looks and feels like trash.  Sorry I purchased it.
1.0,"What I want to say keeps not being approved. But can't deny that the shoe arrived in horrible condition. There's white marks and a sticky substance on them. When took them out the box my youngest was afraid to touch them. I took pictures. They're not wide calf, they are snug. Look elsewhere for boots. These are not worthy."
1.0,"Unable to use it because it was too heavy which it is impossible to stay on your face, and it was too big for my face. I did not return it."
1.0,I wasn’t able to try the outfit on as it arrived with a hole in the sleeve and the ends frayed.
1.0,Material of this hoodie is very uncomfortable and scratchy.  Don’t waste your money
1.0,Faded the same day I wore it
1.0,"Looks nothing like picture, very thin and hard to tell what the print is. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Prongs don't line up, they aren't pressed down. Stone is glued in."
1.0,"Ordered adult extra large, they fit my 5 year old who wears a size 5/6 in little girl sizes... Terrible"
1.0,Way toooo smalll not much give in fabric.
1.0,Stopped working after 1 day.
1.0,"I've been ordering the Ripple Junction --usually Archer branded -- tshirts from various sellers on Amazon. Mainly, because the first<br />few I ordered and received were of high quality cotton, and screen printed graphics!<br />Now I order from various sellers -- because Ripple Junction doesn't ship to Australia.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quality has been hit and miss.<br />The DANGER ZONE tshirt sold by the HAUNTED FLOWER seller is awful.<br />I order larger sizes, because I have big shoulders and a wide torso.<br />Even with XX large, the fit is somewhat tight.<br />And the &#34;cotton&#34; of this tshirt is either some OTHER material, or the Rumplestiltskin character they had<br />make it is using extra thin cotton on his loom.<br /><br />NOT sure if this is the fault of Ripple Junction -- are they suddenly producing low quality shirts? --<br />or if it is the third party sellers, in this case HAUNTED FLOWER.<br /><br />To paraphrase &#34;Archer&#34;: THAT'S how you DON'T get customers<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS, either way."
1.0,Doesn’t give you true night vision improvement
1.0,The fabric doesn’t look like any swimming ware. It look spoiled after the first wash only.
1.0,"I am so so disappointed . I purchased this bag with high expectations and to my dismay in less than a week , yes in less than a week the straps / handles torn off , can you believe it. Now i have  no no bag to wear. I am requesting that i be given a full refund or a better ... way better bag be sent to me immediately. Thank you.... i am so disappointed."
1.0,The fabric feels weird and the cut is not flattering.
1.0,"Lovely dress, however. This dress was worn at xmas and then retuned. How did i know this? There was a sticker left on the dress with xmas pics on it and the name of lindsey roper on it. It was stained and had snags on it. The lady must have been too large for the dress as the bust had a tear at the middle and the back part of the dress was stretched out. Ive tried on the same dress before and it was gorgeous. Seller just got the dress and didnt even look at it. Shame"
1.0,"not worth your money. all the same size, too big."
1.0,The product that I received was not the lemon  earring.  It was an orange slice earring.
1.0,The Velcro fell apart after minimal usage.
1.0,"So they sent me a stained and poorly stitched mask. As you can see in the pictures, the stitching is very poor and there are stains on the inside of the mask. Not you mention the printing is pretty faded. Not cool at all!"
1.0,"The material is rather cheap. I have heavy natural boobs, and I barely pulled on the sting to close the back and one for the loops tore out. I'm sure it works fine for smaller chests."
1.0,Seemed durable when I received and opened. 2 weeks later the spring shot out of it and the metal clasp fell out. It is now worthless.
1.0,"Do not order. It is nothing like the picture unfortunately. I received a waffle material shirt with a lace bottom, not a true peplum style like the picture. Save your money, do not order."
1.0,Was given as a gift. Very disappointed child when it didn't work :(
1.0,"Look good, but too tight and hard to pull up"
1.0,Picture shows shirt coming down over hips. Actual shirt hits around your belly button and is way too short.
1.0,they fit my arm but not my leg and i'm not a big person. i had a pair of these when they were made in the usa which these obviously were not
1.0,I bought this sweater for my boyfriend.  I bought the extra-large.  The sweater is so small that even though I wear a small it is too tight for me.  There were no instructions for returning the product so I am stuck with a sweater that only a child could wear.
1.0,"This case looked great and functional, but ended up being of poor construction.  I bought it as a side gift for my son's birthday.  He opened the case and the slats or &#34;dividers&#34; all fell out.  We tried to stick them back in but they are no more than a thin piece of cardboard with a little thin piece of felt covering them.  We eventually had to glue them in.  I wanted to return it but my son, being the polite person that he is, said it was fine and that he loved the gift and insisted on keeping it.  What a great gift, a box that smells like glue!!!  Not functional at all!"
1.0,I gave to my 3yrs
1.0,Broken elastics in the first few days. Not worth the money
1.0,Skirt material is very cheap not I what I was expecting at all for my money.
1.0,"If I could give ZERO stars I would ! This dress is a disgrace and I cant believe that Amazon would ever agree to let this dress be sold on here! It is NOTHING like the picture and looks like a $2 piece of cloth, nothing like a dress at all!! .....I'm putting in a complaint. Trust me, I'm NOT super picky but this is AWFUL. Save your $$$$"
1.0,"Shame on me for not realizing this is not returnable to amazon. Due to the cost of mailing back to manufacturer, and there is no guarantee you will get reimbursed. I will not be returning this item.<br />This dress is well made so I will give it to my daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than the labeled size on this dress. It should fit her..."
1.0,the threading came out right away and the shirt only lasted one wear. I hadn't even washed it yet. Waste of money but I guess I learned my lesson about ordering on Amazon.
1.0,Loved the look but it was too small.
1.0,"I got this item and it was missing the band.  Still, the ring appears smaller than what it does in the photo.  I tried to match it up with some low eternity bands that I have and none fit right under the setting.  Each one has a huge gap and that just makes it look ugly.  Am returning the item."
1.0,"I was so excited for this to arrive and it finally did today. It fits terribly 😭. I sized up and the bottom half fits well, but the top half is HUGE! Can't be worn without serious alterations."
1.0,Very very very long.
1.0,The dress is made of thin cheap material.  It runs small and does not provide coverage.
1.0,"Just wasn't what I thought it be . Looked nothing like it did on woman.  The Parton bottom where you wrap.was so big, didn't fit correctly.  Was very sad.."
1.0,Not what was pictured looks more like a guys sweater the material is the weirdest material I have ever felt
1.0,"These flip flops are bizzare.  They are slick as glass on the upper part where you put your foot, and just as slippery on the bottom.  The square toe is extremely unflattering and takes me back to 2001 (twenty years ago)."
1.0,"The ring isn't stainless steel, at least the one I received wasn't. The ring itself is thickly plated with a layer of rub off material. After wearing this ring for about a week the pewter underneath started to show. This caused my finger to turn a dark green and the metal slowly began to take a sort of light copper appearance. Not as advertised, and a waste of money. Seriously just save up for a good ring. This costume jewelry will only satisfy so long as you're looking for a ring that won't last. I hope people heed the warning."
1.0,"I thought the scarf was pretty, light for spring and would match many outfits.  I placed the order on March 10, and it still isn't here.  ETD was, at the latest, April 21. Today is the 24th.  This listing now says it is out of stock and unknown when it will be available.  I would stay away from this seller.  I just today sent an email, but don't have time to see if there is any response.  So, that is why the feedback is here as it stands.<br /><br />Too good to be true.  yes, and it was."
1.0,I ordered a 2x.. I usually wear a large.<br />Its to tight across the back..the material is very very thin.. sending this back.. My first return.
1.0,Does NOT  fit at all  like in picture. Gave it to my niece.
1.0,Isn't good fabric I'm not happy .
1.0,"I bought the suit in a xtra small and the quality was great and matched the other reviews, however, I realized it was too small. So I ordered a size up and I am greatly disappointed that I received a phony with bad quality. I'll be trying again for a third time but this unacceptable."
1.0,I don't like it cheap looking and feeling. Looks nothing like picture. Was giving as gift but to embarrassed too.
1.0,This is for a girl not a woman
1.0,Fabric is not as expected and snags easily. Picture is much nicer than actually is.
1.0,Frames came in used and bent. Not happy at all
1.0,Not as advertised at all. They do not work as touch screen gloves. I have to take them off still and they do not keep your hands warm. My hands froze. Do not buy these gloves. They may look cute but that's it.
1.0,Too tight like a swimming cap it would probably be cute on a toddler
1.0,"fit like regular cotton leggings you can buy at target or kohls, not good for running unless you like to jiggle"
1.0,Inaccurate and inconsistent readings even after going through the calibration process a few of times. Definitely not worth the money and can not be trusted.
1.0,I ordered according to what the size chart says. And taking into consideration that is asian size!<br />I usually wear M or L so I ordered XL and I received like a 3XL!!!!<br />Impossible to wear!!
1.0,"Only wore them one night, didn't work so well"
1.0,"Both of them keep falling off keychain.  I don’t know how, it’s just cheaply made. Worthless.  We didn’t even get to use for a week."
1.0,Zipper broke within the first try on. And when you touch the zippers then smell it smells like bronze on your finger. Very cheaply made zipper but besides that I love them!!
1.0,"Loved these straps at first. Easy to install and liked the ability to keep the loop size where I wanted it.....<br /><br />But then one day the controller slipped out of my hand and the 1 thing this strap is supposed to do, failed. It snapped at the connector and the controller flew across the room...."
1.0,"Sizing is ridiculous, so small but so wide."
1.0,"Blurry,  the 5 dollar as seen on tv are far better in my opinion"
1.0,The picture doesn’t show that the zipper goes ALL THE WAY AROUND THE HOOD! I probably could have handled that if the zipper was a small tooth plastic one but it is a LARGE GOLD METAL that gets caught on your hair  and scratches the side of your face. When you Need a jacket because it’s cold outside why would you want cold metal on your skin? VERY BAD DESIGN. I was going to return it but the shipping was $25!!! Unacceptable!<br />It would have been a nice jacket otherwise
1.0,"Not only is it three time it looks in the picture, it's cheap and UGLY. I am so annoyed with it, I literally have to throw it away now."
1.0,The sizes are much smaller.
1.0,"Hard to damage something that is plastic, but my bracelet meat came in cracked and damaged and split. Not easily usable, and an able to return the product. I guess you get what you pay for…"
1.0,Fell apart after 2 days. Dont waste your money.
1.0,There is way too much fabric on the shoulders.
1.0,"This is the worst!  Not worth a dollar!  It arrived vacuum sealed.  It fluffed right up but it smells of gasoline and sheds so badly.  It looks totally cheap, is poorly made and very lightweight.  ( I have purchase items for $26 that look, feel and smell great, not this item.  I only gave this sweatshirt one star because I had to in order to write a review.  Pass on this one, don't waste your money!"
1.0,"These stocks have very poor quality. Within 10 days of me getting them, they had already torn a hole in the heel of one of them. I'm not sure that I wore these socks more than four or five times before they gave out. This is really unacceptable. Keep looking for similar socks that are made of much better material. The idea of wool is great, but they simply do not hold up."
1.0,It broke the fist day I used it when it was raining and windy outside
1.0,Doesn’t have lace up front closure. Looks cheaply made
1.0,"Poorly made.  I ordered 2 of these thinking that the first was just a fluke, however the second one was just as bad.  I returned both of them."
1.0,The belt stretched the first time I wore it. It's cute but wayyyy too cheap! Wouldn't suggest ordering it at all
1.0,"I loved this purse, until the strap busted off in less than a week. It's not like I fill my bag with bricks or anything, just average everyday items. This bag gets one star until the company sends me another bag."
1.0,Product stopped working after 2 months despite putting a new battery in it
1.0,"Color was highly misrepresented (deep/dark blue instead of the light navy vaguely sanded which I loved).<br />Secondarily, ""M"" size was WAY too small compared to other ""M"" sizes you find in similar products."
1.0,"I wanted to like this top, but the buttons were badly misaligned along the front, and one button fell off within an hour if putting it on for the first time. If it weren't for the quality issues, it would be a great top."
1.0,"These do not keep my feet warm, even in my sorels.  Not at all the miracle sock I had so hoped for :("
1.0,Worst ever. This fell apart the second we got it and then it fell off the chain and was lost so I can't even return the piece of junk.
1.0,Returned this product because it did not have all of its components.
1.0,Emblem is of very poor quality
1.0,"I was so excited about this, but the seams came unraveled within hours on the skirt. It is too late to return because my daughter wore it for a few hours. I am bummed."
1.0,"I've only worn these glasses a few times, and already they are extremely loose to the point that I can't even turn my face slightly downward without them trying to fall off . It's really sad because they are so cute and I really liked them at first, plus now it's too late to return them"
1.0,this is WAY too small. it does not fit a 40C. I missed the return window by 3 days.
1.0,Got what I paid for!  Shrunk to a small and thread unraveling first wash.
1.0,"So warm and cozy and I freaking loved it, until the first time I washed it and it got holes all over the back of it. I washed it on delicate by itself and it ripped where there wasn’t even seams. I got a replacement so hopefully it was a fluke because I really do love it"
1.0,"I have this same dress as purchased on Amazon from a different seller.  While it may be suitable to wear out in public one time after you receive it (I.e., before washing), the fabric looks a bit cheap, and feels even cheaper after washing. These dresses just don't wash well - the fabric kind of gets rougher with slight pilling/beading up (which is actually weird for cotton, though I haven't even looked at the label, so assume it has synthetics in it as well.)<br /><br />This type of dress works well as a one-off outfit and then probably best to reserve for wearing on the beach or when on vacation - when &#34;actual&#34; clothes/outfits aren't necessarily expected or required.<br /><br />In the spirit of this observation, I decided to keep the one I already have to wear around the house in the summer as a nightgown, and bought two more from this seller to wear mostly as PJ's, or a &#34;house&#34; dress for when I get out of the shower at night -- it's easy to throw on, without bra and panties, and just lay around the house in comfortably.<br /><br />This particular seller's dress however, is not like the one I purchased before.  This dress is made with thinner and cheaper fabric than the other.  The fit is sort of the same in that it's supposed to be a bit oversized, however I ordered an XL and XXL and neither are roomy enough in the arm, bust/chest, or neck area.  This dress would not fall off my shoulder or hang like it does on the model image, even if I were to order a dress 3 sizes larger.  I typically wear an XL but even the XXL fits more like a large up top, but is XXL sized on the bottom.<br /><br />Additionally, the tailoring (or lack thereof) of the stitches in this dress (I bought both the black and white and fuschia and white) is just plain weird.  I assume they were trying to make one side asymmetrical by gathering some fabric on the right... but whomever put this design together doesn't quite understand how that works. The hip fabric gathers oddly and I look like an Oompa Loompa (but only on one side.) This dress reminds me of the Gordon Gatrelle shirt that Denise made for Theo on the Cosby show.  Not impressed, not even to wear to bed.  I am a bit overweight, but I have curves and can definitely come off as very shapely, sexy, and put together in the right clothing. However I look fat and old in this dress; it's frumpy, odd, and not flattering on me in any way, shape or form.  I am trying to return it but haven't yet received any response from the seller.  Cannot recommend this for anything other than maybe a bathing suit beach cover up."
1.0,"This is not a necklace. It is not 28"" in length. The little metal clasp that the rope runs through looks like it could snap off in a light breeze. JUNK! I do not recommend it, unless of course, you are buying it for a doll that sits on a shelf. UGH!"
1.0,Won't fit an adult.
1.0,Only 14 out of 40 lights worked and some buttons were completely broken off. Don't waste your time and money!
1.0,"Makes you look like a potato, doesn’t have a shape, very wide, highly do note recommend for anyone that has breasts bigger than a C"
1.0,"Bad quality, lasted 1.5 months"
1.0,Fits odd. Not worth it
1.0,Skirt is much much shorter than expected...also size up - fits small.
1.0,"Greetings,<br /><br />The Subject Order Met With Prompt Arrival...<br />However, We Shall Be Thoroughly Displeased With The Item Received.<br /><br />We Searched For: ""Blouse, Tops, Gauze, Light Material, Lavendar, Size Small""<br /><br />The Item Received:<br />Material: Rough, Thick, Most Uncomfortable<br />Size: ""Tent"" Size :(<br />Colour: ""Orangish Puke""<br /><br />Outen To The Debris  - Trash Container"
1.0,VERY POOR QUALITY! DO NOT BUY! THE METAL SURFACE IS TURNING COLOR RIGHT OUT OG THE BOX! TERRIBLE!
1.0,One of the earings came broke.
1.0,This band broke after first use while removing it from my watch.
1.0,"I bought a similar dress from this store and it was cotton spandex.  It was wonderful.  These dresses are not cotton and the quality is poor. I'm very disappointed.<br />Update: if the material is listed in the description on the specific dress,  it's cotton spandex,  if not,  it's polyester.  A second dress that hadn't arrived when I wrote this came in and it was cotton.  The new problem is that the stiching is visible and it looks awful.  The previous dress I bought looked much better.  Still a one star,  but not entirely because of the fabric anymore.  Now I'm adding shoddy workmanship to the list."
1.0,"I like to wear a watch and I'm allergic to nickel so this watch fit the bill. I opened the package, admired the watch and ditched the packaging.<br />The first time I wore it, the glass fogged up INSIDE. Geez, I shouldn't have expected any better, considering the price.<br />Will be more careful in my next selection!"
1.0,"I think I might have gotten a defective one. It’s as if La Croix started producing belts. It has the essence of a belt but still keeps you wondering if it actually is. The locking mechanism within the bucle pretty much stopped working. Unless I’m standing relatively motionless within a minute it starts to loosen more and more to the point that every five minutes I’m having to re tighten it. I’ve had this style of belt before and have never had this problem.<br /><br />Update 4/23:<br />I got a replacement belt. I’m still having the same issue. Works perfectly fine for about a week or so, the the locking mechanism just gives up and the belt is kind of useless."
1.0,Bad quality<br />Broke on fist use
1.0,I don’t know if i return this item because when i try to wear it there’s a lot of particles that come out to my under shirt i don’t know if its normal or damages  (fluff)
1.0,Super mirrored lenses... too much mirror for me
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f61363d67f5cad001edeb9a36a569033]] De muy mala calidad, malas terminaciones, horrible. No lo recomiendo"
1.0,"The skirt in the image of this dress on this site both has a curved seam connecting it to the upper panel, but also has very full volume. WHEN IN REALITY the skirt portion is essentially flat & looks nothing like the image promoting this dress. VERY disappointing as I've been eyeing this dress for some time. Also, it's clear that the fabric shown in the image on this site is VERY different than what this style is actually made of. The image shows a very drapey, flowy, lightweight fabric & the dress I received is incredibly stiff.<br /><br />I could not be more disappointed in this."
1.0,"Very small, very cheap looking.  Not happy with this product."
1.0,"I ordered a size XL.Floral Lilac Purple with ruffle.I usually where a size14. This dress looked like a long top! Not even a short dress. It wasn't even long enough to be a swim coverup, let alone a dress. It looked like it had been washed, shrunk and returned by someone else. Very disappointing but I did receive a refund when i returned."
1.0,This bra was far too small than the size depicted it would be.
1.0,Completely see through. Worst material ever. Ordered a size up and it was still way too small.
1.0,Piece of garbage broke the same day I got it absolutely worthless garbage !
1.0,"Liked the hat at first.  But after wearing it several times and wetting it, it began to smell sour around the inside band.  So bad I didn't want to wear it.  Washed it by hand but once dried still smelled. Washed in the washing machine out of desperation outdise band came apart and still smells. Feel like I wasted my money."
1.0,"Didn't even use it and the scythe is broken. I know, I know. My fault for ignoring reviews but I thought we would get one use out of it"
1.0,Beware. This sweater looks nothing as pictured.
1.0,Looks very low budget
1.0,Save your money...
1.0,This scarf is a cheap fabric and very shiny.  It is also too small to wrap around your neck.<br />It can only be draped and not actually wrapped like a scarf.
1.0,"Received the dress and I opened the bag and started sneezing. Without taking the dress out of the bag, I already noticed some kind of PET HAIR ON THE DRESS. I didn't even try it on because my roommate and I are both allergic. I didn't see any tags on the dress I'm pretty sure it was USED!  What a bad experience. I will not order from them again! Waste of time!"
1.0,Does not work for me
1.0,In the picture these looked really cute like they might be very comfy. However when I opened them up they felt like they were made out of some kind of strange plastic! I’ve never seen anything like it. They went back without even trying them on. Reminded me of those sauna suits from the 70s!
1.0,The charm fell off after one week of gentle use.  Very sad
1.0,While this lists as 'beige' it is closer to an orangish tinge that is not as easy to match to other colors. As it was only $20 I will keep it as I got it more more warmth than fashion but had really hoped for something closer resembling 'beige'.
1.0,"These socks are fine, but there is zero compression."
1.0,The description says white apron with black writing. Instead I got a black apron with white writing. Apron isint a thick apron material either. It’s a thin type of material that is most likely going to be hard to wash and get stains out of. Very upset.
1.0,"This is like a cheap copy of what is shown in the photo., the design is not even the same, another user put photos of what you will get."
1.0,"Lens do not change.  Mine are clear and stay clear outdoors.  Plus, they may be bigger, but not on me.  Small and tight."
1.0,"I like the thing in general,but if you want any kind of length order the tall.Way way short!"
1.0,One of the shoes' straps is very short and does not even reach the buckle.  Have to return these.
1.0,Fit was perfect but the missed stitching and holes were horrible. Should not have passed quality control. Amazon had excellent service and refunded my money.
1.0,"Claimed to be ‘motorcycle gloves’<br /><br />1. There’s no armor or extra padding of any kind for motorcycling. Your hands will get shredded if you wear these.<br /><br />2. I tried using them to operate my motorcycle and the thickness of them makes it impossible to operate the clutch or comfortable roll on the throttle. They’re just not designed for motorcycles.<br /><br />If this was just a review of them as winter gloves then they would get a 4/5, but they’ve advertised themselves as being motorcycle gloves, or at least for motorcycling and they’re not."
1.0,will not keep my watches wound.  if the power so much as blips will turn off and lose all programing.  i have all of my watches on it and they will not stay wound even on the highest settings
1.0,I bought this in EARLY OCTOBER. It is now LATE DECEMBER and I still haven't gotten anything. I thought they were really cute so it's a shame it's such poor customer quality. Want my money back so I can buy something that will ACTUALLY SHOW UP.
1.0,They tarnished and within a week that I had them they look awful
1.0,"Cheaply made, at first glance they look like they are going to fall apart.  I bought these as a gift, but not sure I want to give them to the person.  Also, the picture makes them look like they are a lot longer than they actually are."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fc503a7bc6f0d9b4f5fe7948c8e625db]] Very flawed design broke in 2 days the connection is just glued in terrible quality
1.0,"Cheap product and broke with first 5 minutes of wearing them, I would avoid this one."
1.0,"The size large cover fit my bare finger fine, but when I put it over my size 7 ring, it stretched the ring cover to where it cut off blood supply. I don't have a huge ring, slightly over 1 carat. Very disappointed and will have to return."
1.0,Talk about awful this was a joke it was to tight looked like a blueberry when i tried it on<br />It was the worst material
1.0,Was the wrong size
1.0,way too small wanted clip on earrings these were terrible
1.0,The fabric felt cheap. And it didn’t fit like it showed in the picture
1.0,Bought a XXL and couldn't put my arm in the sleeve.
1.0,"Cheap price, the clasp mechanism does not work well, the locking section is never tight against strap and it is loose. If the clasp section was better built I would recommend It came from China, tool almost a month to get to US. Do not recommend purchasing, look elsewhere"
1.0,"the quality is terrible, do not waste your money, I am so disappointed"
1.0,Ordered a 9. Fits like an 8. My daughter wears an 8 and it fits her. I always order a 9. So disappointed.
1.0,"Horrible, I don't know why this blouse was made only for someone with flat chest!"
1.0,in the picture it’s kind of loose and it’s sexy but the actual product it’s tight and it doesn’t look like the picture
1.0,I ordered a size larger because the review say it runs small. I realized after too late to return that even a medium is WAY too small.
1.0,You must weave the tie through the mesh to tie closed. Will be quite long for short ladies (I am 5’2”)
1.0,Just bought these and the soles ripped up from the base of the shoes on both sides . Waste id money
1.0,Not happy. .when I received its broken. The toe ring is separated cannot repair
1.0,"Every now and then I make mistake. My mistake is using the picture to order the product. The product obviously is good, I just didn’t read the description get enough and paid way too much for a very small bottle of this oil. Once again lesson learned you got me don’t waste your money on the small bottle go to tractor supply and you can get a much larger bottle for half the price I would send it back but I’m tanning a hide and don’t want to waste anymore time. Find a different Seller."
1.0,I lost my I watch due to very poor clasp.  It came off my wrist so easily I didn’t even feel it.  So upset and out hundreds of dollars
1.0,Looked was a returned item. Smelled like ciggarettes. Wasted my money.
1.0,Find something else- used once and won’t close.
1.0,No swim  cap received which is the main reason I ordered this
1.0,"Returned, paper thin material, bright red collor"
1.0,"I couldn't even try it on.marked3 x, it fit someone who is a medium. Made me so ashamed of myself because of my size. Also description said warm winter coat, it's a sweatshirt."
1.0,Strange loose fit and the fabric is almost the same as their t shirts
1.0,This fit when it arrived after washing and hanging dry it shrunk up in length 2-3in
1.0,I returned the top. It was not tailored right.
1.0,"These shoes started falling apart after second use.  The White pealed off, and it was for a 1.5 year old and he is hardly wearing them the way an older toddler would."
1.0,No stars!  Look like they run 14 sizes too small and are as thin as paper!  You can see right thru the material!  Do not recommend.
1.0,Very poor quality!! Stopped working the very  first day!
1.0,The material is much cheaper looking and feeling than expected. The sleeves were itchy!
1.0,"What you get is nothing like the picture.. so if you are looking for a loose tee, don't buy this one!"
1.0,"Very nice bag. The zippers are a little rough and cheap, but I'm very pleased overall.<br /><br />Edit: The zipper broke after six weeks. I don't even use it every day. I don't over-stuff it. The zipper split and, though I was able to move the pull it back to the open position, when I tried to close it again, it split immediately. The rest of the bag seems fine, but the cheapness of the hardware is very disappointing."
1.0,I only add one star because I have to these gloves were delivered today and my son wore them for two hours and the emblems starting coming off on one and the other completely off I don’t<br />Even know where it went I’m so disappointed for the cost and the quality is horrible I would not recommend at all.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt in the same size of other similar shirts I wear. This shirt was much too small. It is sized at least a full size or more small. Shirt seemed nice, but I had to send it back."
1.0,They pinch at the top of my calf
1.0,The satin caps are so out of shape. The elastic wares out in a couple of days. Very uncomfortable. Do not recommend at all.
1.0,"Well, first time using the product - first time cleaning my TYR goggles - ruined. Completely ruined.<br /><br />I followed directions. Rinsed goggles first to rid them of debris. Then applied TYR Anti-fog Drops & Lens Cleaner, wiped it off, and voila - scratches all over. It's like this product took off a coating on the goggles! My goggles can no longer be used. Can't see out of them!<br /><br />Throwing my goggles and this product away."
1.0,The  size runs very big not small but good  material had to give it away&#34;&#34;&#34;
1.0,It was black...it was thin...and too large for a medium...will return the belt
1.0,"EstacMiseta no es 100% algodón como lo describen, esta super delgada y el meterial se siente corriente 😔😔"
1.0,Logo is extra small. Very disappointed. You can barely see Chris Browns face.
1.0,The colours of both cuff link vary ..1 is lighter and 1 is darker . Unfortunately we ordered it through someone who got it for us in India so don’t know how to return it
1.0,This product was way too small. Ordered the biggest size and it looked like a youth size. Don’t order it’s a waste of money .
1.0,Material was very clubland did not fall well upon wearing
1.0,"These watches are complete garbage.  I bought one, had to have it replaced when moisture got into it the first time I took it in the pool (keep in mind they are waterproof), the replacement I was provided with lasted all of 6 months before the second hand literally just fell off one random day.  I fought with customer service to get that one replaced and that replacement lasted a little over a year and before, wait for it, the whole thing stopped working after going in the ocean for 20 minutes.  Don't buy these Hong Kong made pieces of junk."
1.0,Don't waste your money. Its not a sweatshirt at all and the sleeves arent sewn right. And the pockets aren't really pockets. The sellers wont give a refund.
1.0,The shirt runs large. The cutouts in the shoulders were huge. Made the whole shirt look very unflattering
1.0,Do not buy piece of garbage
1.0,I had been wanting to get this jacket for a while and was finally able to snatch one on sale. Even on sale I am beyond disappointed!! The one in the pic looks like a really good quality snugglie sweatshirt. The one I received looks NOTHING like the picture! The material is paper thin annnnd it’s too small! I normally wear a 1X but I ordered a 3X just  in case but it’s still TOO SMALL!!! It fits like an XL! So…Uhhh…Sorry but this is Asian sizing and not American. It’s not even shaped like the picture! Amazon REALLY needs to take this down and not even allow it to be sold! The seller’s name should probably be called “Wish”
1.0,These items constantly break from the arms of my eyeglasses.  I will not buy again.
1.0,They are large flat frames.  The flatness is really weird because anytime you look in your peripheral vision (actually you don't even need to be looking that far side to side) you are looking outside of the sunglasses (much more so than a normal pair of glasses) and it's annoying.  The combo of the size and flatness I think looks weird and I don't like wearing them in public.
1.0,Returned i work outside lenses not dark enough.
1.0,I need to return it!
1.0,These do not hold on the earlobe. The magnets are terrible.
1.0,"These shorts don’t run small nor as expected, I purchased a black pair in an XS and I’m 103 pounds and they fall straight down."
1.0,The material is not what the pictures display. Looks like made in China and Terrible material.
1.0,I can't wear these things for more than 5 minutes without developing terrible soreness.  That soreness lasts up to 10 minutes after I take them out.
1.0,I ordered mui mui sun glasses but didnt came without a case.Ordered large case but sunglasses couldn't fit.
1.0,I've had these now for a few months and there absolute garbage. With in 1 day of wearing each one the balls just randomly fall off. Total waste of your money if you purchase these.
1.0,The elastic will not last passed one washing
1.0,"The plugs look better on the picture. The glitter part is sticky. I was thinking of using these for my sister-in-laws wedding since we have to wear gold accessories, but these are totally not worth it. They are very sticky and do not sparkle at all. Very disappointed."
1.0,The material is awful the shorts fit extremely small. All in all it was a terrible purchase.
1.0,These were ao thin that we had to return
1.0,This sweater was thin and too big for a medium
1.0,DOES NOT STAY FLAT

1.0,The tie tore while unpacking
1.0,dont wast your money.
1.0,This is maybe a L. I think my junior size 3 11-year-old might be able to wear it.
1.0,You get what you pay for.  The fabric was terrible...strange texture and very flimsy.  Looked very cheap.
1.0,Looks like it can fit a toddler
1.0,"I threw it away. Every time I tapped it to see the time, it appear with the setting to adjust the time. Half the time I tapped it nothing appeared."
1.0,"I ordered this coat and finally got it after about 2 months only to find that it does not fit, the sleeves are so small my wife cannot even get her hands threw it and to top it all off I have to pay for its return!!  This is the most HORRID experience I've ever had with Amazon.."
1.0,Made for a child
1.0,Horrible screen protector. It isn't clear and it causes the phone to lag between touching it and the phone responding.
1.0,I am returning! Do not waste your money this set is just like something out of a claw machine at an arcade!
1.0,"Wrong colors, nasty shades of light blue, red, yellow, and white. NOT the colors listed in the description. The yarn is cheap and shiny looking, not at all suitable for historical reenactors. Very dissatisfied with this product and am immediately returning it."
1.0,The watch arrived with the minute hand completely detached from the watch dial. The package showed no signs of damage leading me to believe it’s a manufacturing defect. Unusable and unrepairable out of the box.
1.0,The red has bleed into the white...dissatisfied:(
1.0,I put the hat on and it literally goes down over my face past my chin past my neck!<br /><br />Waited 2 months until it came and was way too big! And unfortunately I don’t return anything cuz it’s a hassle so I now have slipknot bag
1.0,"Very thin material,upon opening noticed there is a run all the way down the leg.."
1.0,For weird
1.0,The dress is beautiful but really small I’m  order XL look like XS
1.0,Popped a stitch and came to pieces after one night. Avoid.
1.0,I bought this suit in November and in 4 months of doing water aerobics it has completely  faded and is almost see through.  I bought it because it said chlorine resistant.  I’ve had other suits much less expensive that lasted a year before they looked this bad.  I can not recommend this suit if your planning to wear it in a chlorine or bromide)<br />(Salt) pool on a regular basis.  Not as advertised
1.0,"I gave the necklace for a gift, it began to unwind yesterday, last then two weeks old. I will contact Amazon for a return."
1.0,"Broken,  without a clasp. Cab you wear a necklace without a clasp. I should've listened to the reviews."
1.0,Paint flakes off easily
1.0,"As soon as a I saw the plastic bag it came in it was a red flag. The material is cheap and it is small. I didn't even try it on the kids, but the one for the 6 year old looked like to would maybe fit the 3 year old."
1.0,Too small . ordered an X large. Fits my 11 year old Granddaughter who is 90 lbs.
1.0,It tarnished after a couple weeks of wearing. Think twice before purchasing. The seller will not work with you.
1.0,This was really huge for my head. I thought if I put my steampunk goggles on it would be decent but it didn't do the trick. It had this weird tugging on my hair that was really uncomfortable. It felt like it was ripping my hair out.
1.0,"These gave me a major camel toe 😅 so it’s definitely not flattering and I just don’t wear them because of that.<br />I looked at others reviews before buying and it seemed like it wasn’t gonna do that, but unfortunately it just doesn’t fit me well.<br />Idk if maybe a black color would work best? But It sucks I can’t wear mine"
1.0,"my bracelet broke right out box, I took it out of the pouch and it was broken never got to wear it. Very Dissapointed.."
1.0,So happy and excited for this shirt to arrive. I'm let down however about the fact it's not wearable. The sleeves are short and I can extend my arms in upward motion. My other LIG shirts are perfect however.
1.0,"Thin material, cheaply made, poor quality, flimsy and runs small. Reminds me of a Halloween costume from Wal-Mart. Definitely returning."
1.0,Am trying to return this item but no where in my vicinity can do this type of label... please give me another option!
1.0,They fell apart the first time I wore them
1.0,"The material was nice, but it came with multiple stains on it"
1.0,"I always have to adjust the sides of these socks during Pilates class.  Non-slip grip poor construction, I almost fell.  Too bad I can't return them as I've worn them already."
1.0,"Cut deep in the cleavage and I have a small chest. I can't imagine how this would fit someone with a big bust. Also, bottom is nearly see-thru. Stay away from flash-photography or from being outdoors in the sun! You will see EVERYTHING. Would definately need a slip on under this dress. This design/pattern is awesome though."
1.0,It’s not very good I can remove the chain in a pull
1.0,I wore these glasses 4-5 times and the plastic broke in half on back.  I will not purchase again.
1.0,I hated this dress. What I received was not what I saw in the advertised photo. It fit terrible and looked very cheaply made. I did return it. I must say both the seller and amazon were wonderfully helpful with the return. It was unfortunate because I usually like what I buy from amazon. Rarely disappointed.
1.0,"I wish I read the 1 star reviews before purchasing.<br /><br />The description and photos are very misleading. They say/show 5 keychains, however, only one ships.  Very misleading advertising. I would not have spent $8 on one keychain.<br /><br />Also, these are too fragile to be used as a keychain.  It appears to be more of a novelty item.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the misleading product description."
1.0,"It is too clunky, too heavy!"
1.0,"Aside from the fact that I ordered this in April and got it in June or July, this thing is cheap! You definitely get what you pay for for this. This is like a costume like fabric and it is not comfortable. The outside looks tie-dye, but is obviously printed because the inside is completely white. Look at my pictures for reference. Don’t waste your money, buy the real thing from vici.com."
1.0,Box was dirty and the seal was already opened. Looks like it was a returned item not something you would want considering the item nature.
1.0,These glasses showed up broken. A lens was already off when I opened the box.
1.0,"Order and when I recieved it, the package was bent so the hat was bent, then the logo on the hat looks very poorly ironed on.  The logo looks like it was half way cut out between the C and the S, there is different coloring on the different sides of the logo.  have submitted a return request."
1.0,Had these one day and the tiny began coming off the lens. Complete garbage
1.0,Fits terribly
1.0,I ordered 3 sizes larger and it was very snug and the sleeves were not as seen in picture. I returned
1.0,They don’t  adhere properly. Hard to know where  exactly to place them.  The  strength of the lens are not accurate. And very noticeable.
1.0,"While I enjoyed the cut of the stones, I was disappointed that the labradorite is fake. I have been a collector of minerals and crystals for 25 years."
1.0,After a few months these started ripping. The waistband started coming apart. Such a waste of money.
1.0,it was wrinkled up and i cant straighten it out
1.0,"I can't even give a ONE star review,  these earrings came to me beyond defective. On one earring,  part of the decoration wasn't even attached to the Lever back and the drop of that earring doesn't even ""dangle"". The other earring,  the ""dangle"" drop wasn't even attached and I can not attach it back because I'm afraid I will break the connection that is supposed to hold the drop... Saying I'm beyond disapointed is an understatement. If they had came to me the way they were shown on Amazon,  they would have been beautiful. Now I'm sitting here,  dissatisfied  and beyond disapointed...."
1.0,XL is more like XS.  Definitely not true to size.
1.0,Not what it looks like in ad at all
1.0,Ridiculous. The flower is so heavy that it hangs down where you can't even tell what it is. And they hurt my ears. Waste of money.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, see through and the sizing is ok...overall not that pleased with this purchase..returning"
1.0,"This is not a Reebok cap, feels cheap, doesn't even have the logo on it. Back it goes."
1.0,These would not stay on so I had to put a drop of super glue in the hole. The left one fell off within 10 minutes after wearing them.
1.0,The glue that they use is not good as you can see in the picture
1.0,too large plus the picture and the product is different i wanna trade now
1.0,Have only worn a few times and the piece on the zipper that you use to pull up the zipper broke on them also the belt looking straps that are on the sides one of the sides the ends of the straps stick out and won’t lay down and one part come off that’s suppose to look as if it’s holdinf the strap down
1.0,"These are plastic not metal. The packaging was also pretty beat up on arrival. Did not look nice, box was bent and plastic peeling off."
1.0,I received the wrong size and the tag was cut off from the bodysuit and the threading is loose.
1.0,"This sweater took about a month and a half to arrive, it smelled awful, the quality is not what I expected, and it was too big. The sizing is partly my fault for ordering a size up, but it was also longer than I expected. It says not to machine wash, but you definitely would not want to wear it without washing it - there is a very strong factory or acrylic scent to it, and I am admittedly lazy about hand washing. It also doesn't seem like great quality material - a few threads were already pulled out on the back side straight out of the bag, and it states the material is 100% acrylic. Returning this and hoping it doesn't take a month and a half to get my money back. This definitely wasn't worth the wait or the money as many other recent reviews state."
1.0,The rings are gorgeous in the pictures and was really excited to get them.<br />Only problem when it came there were no rings! :(
1.0,Product was at all like pictures. I tried to return; however a month later and I’m still waiting to hear from seller.
1.0,Cheap and terrible. Very low quality
1.0,Don’t waste your money. One pair had the lens cockeyed and I couldn’t see anything with them. They don’t fit well and are heavy.
1.0,Holes are not aligned right and you will  ruin your watch trying to make it work. I broke a screwdriver stabbed my hand and ruined my watch trying to make this work! DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Fabric is stiff and doesn't have shape to it. The V-neck is subtle not like the picture. Not happy at all and will return. Looks like scrubs.
1.0,Looked like a huge potato sac not flattering at all
1.0,"It’s a very comfy coat, but the button was rip out of the whole when it arrived!!! Not happy!!"
1.0,Nothing in mailbox!!!
1.0,I like the color and style but nothing else.
1.0,You have to put this together yourself. Wouldn't be a problem if it actually held together using the tape they give you.
1.0,This ring is awful in person.... I was so excited to get it and when I did I was so disappointed. Its also to small.... total waste!
1.0,These are not red.
1.0,"Returned, not like shown and poor quality and sizing."
1.0,"Received what appears to be someone else's product with the tags removed, sent back for replacement and received the same thing a second time. Several holes/cuts where the tags were cut off.<br /><br />Definitely ordered from the listed manufacturer (MAKEMECHIC) so it would seem they are repackaging factory seconds or overstock."
1.0,these are HUGE. adult sized not baby sized.
1.0,Product is good when there is no wind.It was broken just for normal wind
1.0,Very cheap looking  don't look like picture
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ab80494c179d240ee6e40e391db25156]] Not acrylic; broke before I could wear them.
1.0,"I bought this without reading the reviews which was a mistake. It arrived on time but within 2 or 3 hours of wearing it, it randomly broke. I would not recommend buying this even though it is cute, unless you can fix it continually."
1.0,"Well if you have large breast, it does not work for you."
1.0,"I returned these because they are not as pictured. The material is stiff and thick, not flowy. I am a size 8-10 and ordered the large and the shorts were tight, not loose as pictured."
1.0,"These masks are thin which is fine but the shape that these masks were cut were nothing like the picture. They were cut in a way where the area by your nose has a small high pointed crest which doesn't allow much protection around your nose. Not only that but they were not cut evenly, it looks ridiculous and a few masks were smaller than the others. I like the designs but that's the only positive.<br /><br />I purchased this while it had a discount on it, not even sure if I should keep them or send them back because I doubt I will be using these when I have other masks that are much better. I do not recommend these."
1.0,"Run small, cheap, but cute. Can't wear them though."
1.0,"Weird material, super tight, not what I expected."
1.0,I ordered a large and it so small
1.0,The texture was weird hated how it looked
1.0,Horrible fabric quality. Oddly slinky and shiny. Sent it back pronto.
1.0,I have had this for two months and the strap broke off. Now I can't use it. No way to contact company as they don't sell it anymore. Now I'm stuck with a bag I can't use.
1.0,The material is very cheap. This top almost feels like a costume. I don’t recommend.
1.0,"Adjustable, which is cool. Changes color of ring and finger within days though. Maybe polish w clear nail polish but not for regular wear."
1.0,Not at all as I expected
1.0,I ordered this expecting to match all my other coyote brown gear and this does not even look brown in person. Don't buy this if color matching is important to you.
1.0,"So pretty, but I bought this in silver back in June and it’s now November and it has turned brassy. I didn’t wear it more than a few times, most of the time it was hanging it up. I didn’t get it wet or anything I’m very disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,diferent color like the pictures
1.0,"Too Small, the feathers are already coming out."
1.0,"Is does not work! At all! I tried it on both brass and sterling silver- both somewhat tarnished, but not heavily. Followed directions, first without moistening surface and then again with moistening surface. NO results! Returning.<br />Will go back to Wrights Silver Cream and Copper Polish. Although a little messy works wonderfully."
1.0,I needed l to xl but got medium . dont fit the ordering sizing was to complicated.
1.0,I don't know if the ad is correct but the ones I received were too large in diameter and the wrong threads for my strat...rather than mess around trying to return I turned one down and re-threaded it to 10-32 as should be for my strat
1.0,"Ordered This, Recieved a Large T-Shirt that Says &#34;I like Big Boats and I Cannot Lie&#34; with a tag that said Infant IH Logo One Piece."
1.0,if you are short this would probably would be ok but if you are average to tall forget it.
1.0,"When they say M,L sizes they need to say that they mean a child sized between the ages of five and seven years of age.<br />When they say XL/XL they may mean that it may fit the most petite 5’2” extremely narrow straight up and down built female."
1.0,All the jewelry fell apart within a couple of hours
1.0,Canada
1.0,Super small. VERY clingy!
1.0,"Don't be fooled into buying. The photo is not what you will receive. The official Lamborghini version is pictured. This is a bad knock off. Heat pressed fake logo on cheap wrinkled ball cap. Not embroidered, not even a decent knock off. Couldn't pass inspection from a blind person. Complained to Amazon and they just brushed it off since it's a 3rd party seller. Seller wouldn't even respond. I'm out $$ for crap. Amazon should crack down on this it's becoming too common."
1.0,This mask was so ugly that it gave people nightmares! Totally not SVEN at all. Maybe Sven during The Purge or the bootleg version of Frozen. Poor packaging had the mask all bent up and looking extra special.
1.0,Cute shoes. but totally unexeptable for young kids feet.
1.0,This is very cheaply made. Necklace and pendant tarnished badly after wearing a few hrs. I did contact the seller on this!!
1.0,"Beautiful set.  Would've given 5stars,  but hook on earrings aren't very sturdy, the plastic end guards on the posts are on so tight one snapped of while I was trying to get it off."
1.0,Garbage.  The Earsocks are too short and the inner diameter is too large.  These two issues make the rubber free spin and slip all over the frame.  They look absolutely ridiculous since they don't fit and also have &#34;Made in the USA&#34; and &#34;CE&#34; molded in huge letters on the insides.<br /><br />The nose piece replacements are made of extremely hard rubber or plastic and all four were crushed and broken upon arrival due to the cheap material and the fact that they were shipped in an envelope which ran though a USPS machine.
1.0,"These are very uncomfortable!  My children said they ""really hurt"".  While they are thin plastic, the edges are very sharp.  I do not recommend."
1.0,Too big-  I wish I got the SM<br />But in most things I am a MED<br /><br />Looks very boho in the picture and in real life it doesn’t look as boho-  it looks heavy and thick
1.0,"Not true to size at all , runs very small. I got a 2x, fits more like a medium."
1.0,Want a green bellybutton then send it bro
1.0,"I was really disappointed in this dress. I love the pattern, but it was way too small. I have ordered from Mitily before and its been great, but this dress was a let down."
1.0,I bought these shoes for my 11 year old in May. It’s now June and I’m already having to buy him another pair of sneakers. The souls became detached. I wouldn’t recommend these at all
1.0,"I purchased this as a surprise for my husband and i received it today and loved the look and the material but when i went to try on the babydoll part(not g-string) it came absolutely nowhere close to covering my breast i was not able to tie it even with the straps adjusted,. great look but absolutely not for big busty women!!"
1.0,"I was very excited to recieve as I've been shopping around for a cute sherpa zipup fpr awhile.<br /><br />Sadly I was very disappointed. Fabric is very poor quality and cheap, both the sherpa and the lining on the sleeves. It was shedding straight out of the bag. Zipper sticks and is also cheaply made.  It was also much longer than in the photo."
1.0,quality was terrible product was severely mishapen
1.0,I would give this product 0 stars. Suit fit perfectly but filled up with water right when my legs entered the water. This is a cheap suit with cheap zippers and stitching.
1.0,"Not for short girls. I’m 5’3”, 140 lbs and this made me look frumpy."
1.0,"I hate ordering something that says it is one size and it is way off, do they do the measuring from a doll or what"
1.0,It was not boatneck but very tight crew neck. Returned.
1.0,Just outside the return window the waist button closure came off
1.0,"After handwash or machine wash , the dress will shrink"
1.0,"I bought these for my husband thinking that they were boxer briefs as stated, but they do not have a slit in the front so they are really just shorts. He isn't able to use them so I just use them as shorts to sleep in. I'm mostly disappointed because I thought he would really like them and because they are not really men's underwear he can't use them."
1.0,Terrible material. Was not flattering and front was much shorter than anticipated.
1.0,Really bad see through
1.0,"Incredibly difficult to attach to my glasses.,Gave up and returned them"
1.0,Nowhere in the description does it say this product is crappy fake gold. They trick you with the black and white photo. It is poorly made and looks like crap.
1.0,"My wife loves Sakroots purses and I have never heard her complain about them at all until this one.<br /><br />The credit card slots are NOT for credit cards, apparently.  Someone made a serious design flaw.<br /><br />This one is going back."
1.0,"the suspenders were a great price, $5.99,  you get what you pay for, low quality, the snap closers would not stay closed, returned this item"
1.0,"This bracelet is garbage, it doesn't stay tightened on your wrist, you have to tighten it every few minutes (annoying), plus all the silver on the bracelet started to rust! And that was all within the first few days ive worn it!! do not purchase!! Waste of $$! Not happy!"
1.0,Pretty but turned green within a week.
