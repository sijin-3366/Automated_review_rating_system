1.0,One of the earrings were broken when they arrived.
1.0,What is in picture was not what I received
1.0,Poor quality wore once all the embellishments washed off .washed on gentle inside out.Doesn't even get 1 star!!!<br /><br />But would not let me submit review otherwise
1.0,Very very poor quality! I opened the package and they were the widest 6-8 size I have ever seen! The fabric felt very cheap. It was unsatisfactory.
1.0,The sunglass has not good quality both for frame and glass.
1.0,"I ordered these shorts on MAY 12.  Amazon sent a note that they would be delayed until mid-July at the latest. They arrived today, August 3rd.  When I went to return them, I was told that ""the window for return closed August 1st.""  They do not fit and are not attractive and  I would have returned them today, but I can't.  It's not that much money, but this infuriates me!  I am a loyal customer and this is not how I, or anyone else, should be treated.  There is no way to contest this online, so I am writing this review and will probably give the shorts to the Goodwill, where, hopefully, someone will get some use of them, which would be good.  No kudos for Amazon or the manufacture on this one!"
1.0,"I'm really not in the mood for this, these issues just frustrate me even more, why does your medium size fit like a small?????"
1.0,"Not what expected, returning"
1.0,Very very cheap material. Failed the initial water test the instructions tell you to do!!
1.0,"These don't work at all,  I can't even tell if they look good on me."
1.0,Waste no use...
1.0,"Cheap, don't even waste your time."
1.0,"I was so excited for this dress! As it looked cute and light, but when I first got it in the mail I received a completely different dress. I asked for a return to get the dress I did order and they shipped the dress quickly which was nice. But, upon getting the dress again it was damaged. It looks like the sleeve got melted and holes. There were spots on the dress too that made it look like it was used. The fabric was not what I was expecting either. Very shinny light fabric that would Kling on unwanted areas. This dress had so much potential…"
1.0,"I love friends and thought this would be a good addition to my many shirts. It’s pretty but it’s very thick, even without the filters. I know this is important to some people so if you want a thick mask this is for you."
1.0,Not that scary.....
1.0,Fabric is really cheap and the shape is not right at the top. Falls off shoulders even when it is otherwise the right size.
1.0,Lights quit working
1.0,Does not block the sun
1.0,Junk! Do not buy.
1.0,This dress was made very cheap and it did not meet the expectations of a $35 Dollar purchase. You couldn't tell the front from the back. The dress didn't have any tags to determine the front from back. Very poor item.
1.0,They both broke the same day I bought them for myself as soon as I put them in the (stones) fell out almost simultaneously I'm kinda done buying on amazon I ordered this watch two separate times it never came
1.0,"It took 2 weeks to get these masks. Was excited to see them but when I opened the package, it was not as expected. The colors were correct but NOT 3 layers! The back of the masks was a thin piece of cloth and had a pocket for a filter, which was not in the description. So disappointed"
1.0,"They both had broken handle.....The first one I received had broken handle, so I asked to replace it. But, the second one also had the same problem.....OMG"
1.0,It lasted less than 2 months before the light button fell off. Don’t plan on buying these again!
1.0,I love this company. But I only received one earring which was upsetting
1.0,"As noted above the watch was shipped out of box. Box is two piece, and was together in a way used for display. Appears watch and open box thrown into package and shipped. Watch band was broken, missing pins, etc. Watch backing plate was off and would not go on, damaged. Watch unusable. So, 39.95 plus shipping to go from the shippers trash can to mine. Pretty unethical stuff.<br />To be fair - its a cheap, cheap watch. But it should show up in one piece, not multiple damaged."
1.0,"This does not look like a coat, rather more like a fuzzy bathrobe. Trying to return for full reimbursement. However seller is not responding to my email."
1.0,"Too small, had to return."
1.0,"I was most disappointed with this mask. I have a Catwoman mask bought in the mid-90s, not long after the film was released, and the quality of that older mask is still 100 times better than this awful thing. The smell of rubber was putrid, the stitches lazily painted - no nuance, no quality here. The &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34; stamp was huge on the back - and it was so small my head could barely squeeze in before cutting circulation off around my eyes. Such a shame."
1.0,"I did not receive this dress. The cut is completely different, there is no belt, it is not fitted, and it looks like a plaid sack. I’m returning it."
1.0,"My husband bought these, but they are very distorted and we returned them."
1.0,First off the lenses are far too close together to where they barely fit on my nose but rather sit on top. Also the frame is bent around the right lense. Disappointing.
1.0,"Terrible quality, super cheap. Will never wear again"
1.0,The picture shows a short sleeve. Mine was long and loose
1.0,The dress fits well and is flattering and comfortable. The fabric is thin but I was looking for a summer knock-around dress so that didn’t bother me.  Wore it for the first time to walk to lunch with my husband. I had a cloth purse over my shoulder and were ever it touched the dress it is now terribly pilled.  I imagine another wearing or two and it will start to look like a rag.  You definitely get what you pay for.
1.0,Maybe this was a junior size skirt. Definitely not a womans size.
1.0,The sleeves on this shirt are sewn on very weird and create a pocket on your shoulders when you were it. I was super bummed about it because the material of the shirt is soft and the design was nice. Do not purchase!!!
1.0,Does not keep accurate time inspire being an automatic timepiece
1.0,Broke with a week of buying. Very cheaply made
1.0,Could not really use it. It's hard to get card out of it
1.0,The designs aren't as aesthetically pleasing as they appeared to be on the site. I couldn't wear these and feel like I look good.
1.0,"The color is lighter than in the pic. The whole thing looks cheep, really cheep. I did not return it on time and I totally tegreat it. I won’t use this outside home never."
1.0,"My mother in law just passed Tuesday, an this was purchased by my husband and I for my sister in law. She was upset with how this came out and as am I. There is way to much white glue or whatever it is holding the diamonds. Not worth the price for it to be sent out like this."
1.0,"These shoes are of horrible quality.  First of all, they're basically socks, they barely provide any protection from the ground and they provide no support.  They are also very slippery.  Worst of all, my son wore them for maybe 2 weeks, and they COMPLETELY fell apart.  They got ripped to shreds and the sole detached from the rest of the shoes.  These are not even worth the $7 you pay for them."
1.0,Doesn't send texts to emergency contact unless in bluetooth range.  It is not an unlimited range as they say..Very deceptive advertising.
1.0,"This was the wrong size.  However, the major problem with the purchase was that the belt smelled like motor oil. ( Is that what is meant by oiled leather?) I doubt that this belt is really leather.  I returned the belt."
1.0,"Mismatched pattern, buttons not centered…not as pictured.  I would not recommend!"
1.0,I ordered white gray and pink but received light gray dark gray and pink. Then was told I was wrong as if I don't know my colors.
1.0,"I’m so incredibly sad. These fit beautiful, so so comfortable. I’ve bought several others and these just didn’t hold up. The quality just wasn’t there."
1.0,Not worth it to buy comes off
1.0,It came to me broken. The ring was detached.
1.0,"I've purchase size 32, but it runs sooooo big, it's like 38-40.  Cannot return it because now the package is in the Dominican Republic so return items its more expensive.  I am looking forward to give it to a relative."
1.0,"It's completely see-through! Also, the cut is large and strange. The whole booty area sags... The ruggles and bows are cute but... 😬"
1.0,"This jacket is a scam.<br /><br />EDIT- and now the company Is emailing me like crazy begging me to take this review down but it was nothing like the picture, extremely small, and all the fur/hair feel off when I opened it and went all over the carpet."
1.0,Purple coating flaked off almost immediately.
1.0,"I have to admit disappointed because I was flat out sent the wrong size.. twice... I really would have loved these because the material felt soft and light, but it is not good to not be sent the size that was ordered."
1.0,Looks nothing like the pants on the model. Got a 4x and they were still too tight.
1.0,Can I return for a smaller size?<br />This brand's M size is way bigger than all other brand's M size.
1.0,"This is so badly made. Cost more to ship, no wonder it is so cheap,  I am so upset with this product. PLEASE READ COMMENTS BEFORE YOU BUY"
1.0,Waaaaaaay too small and not adjustable at all.
1.0,Very flimsy.. They were delivered in an envelope. They are a cool shape but quality is poor not worth the cost.
1.0,Thoroughly disappointed. Do not buy! Cannot wear this at all.
1.0,"I was very excited about receiving the watch because I thought it was really great when I saw it, but when I opened it, it immediately fell apart. I tried to put the piece back on then realize that the other side did not have a opening for the latch to stay on. I wanted to wear this to an event that I am going to on June 5th now I'm unable to. I just received this no more than 5 minutes ago."
1.0,El reloj parece un súper reloj y en realidad es muy pequeño
1.0,There is a great supply of toe rings for my wife to chose from however she couldn’t find 1 that fit her. She has average toes and they were all way too big...very disappointed.
1.0,The fabric is shiny and cheap- has a slippery feel to it. I ordered a large (39 inch chest) and it was too big. Returning it DON’T BUY!!!
1.0,"When the straps arrived, it was not a set of 4 but 1 single strap. When the clasp was locked and you pulled on the strap, the clasp just pulled right apart. It would never have held a piece of luggage together."
1.0,Frames are lopsided and the lenses look weird on your face
1.0,"Hard to review an item you cannot wear!! Super small, beware!<br />If you wear a small order an xl!"
1.0,Never looked like the pictures
1.0,The storage pouch is not connected to the bag. There are better alternatives than this
1.0,"Buyers beware. The hats pictured with the 7.1"" brim and two little buttons with loops at the edge of the brim to hook onto the button IS NOT AVAILABLE. The seller is aware that the pics and description are wrong and will simply offer to let you return it. The one you get (I ordered two different colors) does NOT have the button on the side or loops at the EDGE and is ONLY 6"" at the brim! There are several listing with this same hat and I've ordered now from 3, all to get the same exact hat! 6"" brim! There are also several with a description showing a 6"" brim and that's fair - at least you are getting what you ordered. Just know that the hat you receive is NOT the one described or pictured. With that said... the 6"" hat I received is bright in color, seems to be well made and lightweight. It is snug as others have said and I don't have a large head. The large brim and wire edging is why I wanted this hat. Just wish it was the one described and pictured."
1.0,Loved the style and color but it only lasted a whopping 2 weeks. I will not be buying from wristology ever again. I am returning/going to try to get a refund as it lasted a literal 14 days....
1.0,"Something weird happened with this shirt.  I wore it one time and then washed it.  The white turned a very dark yellow.  Nothing else in the wash did that nor was there anything in the wash that has ever had any kind of an effect like that.<br />Of course, I can never wear the shirt again.  It looks hideous."
1.0,"The first two orders arrived OK, but the third order came with a pair missing.<br /><br />After several months we are still awaiting a promised replacement, which I believe will not happen.<br /><br />Shame, because the product is excellent."
1.0,"I had this bag 6 weeks, shoulder strap broke, front zipper torn out"
1.0,"Really cute. I ordered a large even though I wear a medium.<br />I didn’t like the material at all.<br />The fit, let’s just say I can always give them to one of my granddaughters."
1.0,Trash came a part at the seams first wear
1.0,"The material is so sheer you can almost read through it. In normal lighting, the pants would show everything. In low lighting such as a night club, they would be fine. And since they are so sheer, they are thin acn and cool for dancing."
1.0,"Cheap junk, painful to wear."
1.0,"Definitely not gray, but I knew that was probably the case by reading previous reviews. Seems well made. Smells pretty bad, and I don’t exactly know what the smell is? I’m going to leave it out all night with fabric sheets in it. Hopefully that will rid the smell. 3 stars only because of the smell.<br /><br />****decided to return item....the smell is so offensive I don’t want to put anything I own in it*****"
1.0,Wasted my money on this.  Way too small even though I tried to adjust the size as stated.
1.0,"I bought the exactly same one in the same link a couple weeks ago, the color was off but still looked a little like the picture, this one is TOTALLY different"
1.0,I absolutely fell in love with this necklace when I got it!!!! But it broke with in a week. I haven't been able to fix it sadly. I wish I could order another one but I lost my job. So I just keep it in my makeup bag and look at it when I do .my makeup.
1.0,"This jacket is very disproportionate. The torso section is super short while the arms are normal length. I really liked the color combination on it, but I don't understand how this would work for working out or comfort purposes at all."
1.0,6 months looks like for 3 months. Too small and very tight!
1.0,"The Winchester is a cheap sticker, i touched it and it started to peel off, Its not worth your money!"
1.0,Might as well be naked pretty ichy too
1.0,This product runs ridiculously small.
1.0,awfull
1.0,The gold rubbed off with in a week
1.0,I wanted to love these but they seem flimsy and don’t sit right on my face.  The kind of sunglasses that give you a headache after 5 min.
1.0,Way to large for size listed not  worth wasting time or money  when needed  to  return  you have to pay own shipping and  12 to 18 months is more like  a 3 years old size
1.0,If you have any chest then the dress looks like you are trying to hide a pregnant belly. Already sent it to the thrift store.
1.0,Product turned dark after two days of use
1.0,"It's pretty, I suppose, but was only a small fraction of what I expected"
1.0,Nice shirt for a women
1.0,I'm very displeased with the quality of the material.  It sticks to itself and to anything put into it.  I bought it to replace an old wallet with a broken clasp and zipper but I luckily didn't throw it out and have already switched back to it.  The shiny material sticks to itself and is coming off rapidly.  An absolute waste of money.
1.0,"Awful stitching, started tearing apart within a week. Back pockets look odd, too spaced out"
1.0,Did not fit did not open properly very small
1.0,GOT THIS FOR MY MERMAID OUTFIT AND IT BROKE BEFORE I COULD EVEN WEAR IT THAT NIGHT:/
1.0,"This was pretty, but more blonde than red. And my daughter could only tolerate it for 15 minutes. The hair was decent quality, but this was a flop for us."
1.0,Returned them as they were way larger then depicted in the online photo.
1.0,"We lost this after one use. While we properly secured it, it was missing off of our luggage at the end of one flight."
1.0,"Bought 2 dresses.  Badly made,  wanted to returned and they don’t want to return my refund….."
1.0,This dress looks nothing like what is pictured. The material is scuba-suit like and the neckline is almost a turtleneck.
1.0,"Cheap material, small cut. I went up 2 sizes and the dress didn't fit.  The cut in the front of the dress is also too high. I literally felt exposed. The dress is made similar to picture but doesn't hang or look like it is picture. I was so disappointed."
1.0,Print wasn’t right - like it had rubbed off.
1.0,"The style and fit of the shoe is great however after wearing the shoe for 30 minutes,  I noticed my toes looked dirty.  Upon removing the shoes I found the black dye was rubbing off onto my feet!"
1.0,Worst bow purchase ever. It came off the clip the first time she wore it!!
1.0,"I bought the band to replace the original one that comes with the Fitbit Charge 5.  Although it latches on and seems appropriately connected, it randomly falls to the ground.  I bought both the brown and black bands.  Neither function as advertised.  Both randomly disconnect. Very disappointed and will not purchase this brand again."
1.0,"If I could put less than one star I would, this top is nothing like the photograph, Not only was at the wrong style but it was cheaply made and damaged...<br /> Poor quality and holes throughout as if somebody took a pair scissors to it...<br /> I am extremely disappointed"
1.0,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT! The clasp on every single one of these broke immediately. It’s extremely cheap and horrible. I went through 6 of them before I could get one that fastens and didn’t break. Awful
1.0,"How is it when I purchased this plug there were no reviews. Then as soon as I receive my item with only A SINGLE plug in it, I go to double check if I made a mistake and then all of a sudden there's a couple reviews saying they had the same issue? Makes zero sense. Definitely returning it, I'm not paying another $10 for another ONE and have to wait two weeks for it anyway."
1.0,"Firstly the appearance looks nothing like the item sold! The jacket sold looks more like some 70's era costume! The fit is equally as bad, the sleeves are like an extra small and the length is like an xxxl! To sum up, I think any 5 year old could have did a better job in constructing a jacket! What a joke!!"
1.0,These are footies/booties they are NOT socks at all-very disappointed 😡 AND THEY ARE SEE THROUGH!!!
1.0,Varying degrees of sizes and actually being seen together.
1.0,had a hole in it before it was even worn. I went to put them on for the first time and there was a large hole in the leg. Terrible quality.
1.0,Nice looking band unfortunately broke in a week and almost caused me to lose the watch.
1.0,Junk. False advertisement! DON'T BUY THEM  They don't like to refund money.
1.0,The steam on the back of the earring was broke upon receiving.  Never got a chance to wear them. :(  However they are very cute.
1.0,This non-returnable (apparently) glasses case does not hold my eye glasses which are of standard size!  Do not purchase this brand you will be highly disappointed!
1.0,"First off the measurements of these are off and not really an &#34;aviator&#34; the width says 58mm but mine were 53mm.  And the height was only 45mm?? These are like a navigator-aviator hybrid.  Picture doesn't look what like what I got.  Other than that the left lens wasn't completely in the frame but it was sturdy and took a close inspection.  Also the right ear rest was bent but was fixable.  For $9 the construction was as expected, maybe a bitter better even.  The lens is pretty dark and fully mirrored but not polarized (didn't say it was saw some questions answered that said they were).  So basically the size and shape was messed up and since I wanted aviators gets a 1-star.  Not worth sending back will probably use as a trash pair."
1.0,"The bracelet broke as soon as I put it on the first time. It's very pretty, just what I wanted. It was just not very sturdy."
1.0,Terrible quality. Fell apart within a week my Girlfriend and I had them.
1.0,0-3 months is more like 3 -6 months. Did not fit my friend's one month old.
1.0,I sent this piece back.
1.0,Very disappointed in these slippers! They are very cute; however they are extremely wide. I ordered an 8 and in a week they are so wide they barely stay on. Could have ordered a size smaller. The inside lining sheds and comes out  on the floor. These will not last long. Another issue is when I ordered they were $30 and the day they came were listed for $15☹️ Very disappointing!
1.0,"What a piece of crap , it’s a silk screen insignia, peeling off"
1.0,"Hard to get into bag with the 2 compartments.  Inside zipper broke on first opening.  Zippers cheaply quality. Bag looked nice, good size though."
1.0,They may look expensive but they’re cheap as hell the first pair was delivered damaged and I still haven’t heard back from that the second pair broke within 12 hours of putting them on my face ...a piece of cheap plastic
1.0,"My size is 34B, 29, 36 and I got a large. Usually that size fits me in lots of cosplays and Asian tailored garments. But this has the worst fit. It barely fits at the waist for the skirt and the shirt hardly buttons. If you do decide to get this cosplay, size up two or even three sizes!"
1.0,Malisima<br />Calidad!
1.0,"Photo leads you to believe at the very least the sleeves are a warm woven fabric when in reality the whole thing is cheap polyester, not warm, thin."
1.0,Beautiful but WAY too tight! go up a size or two.  Wish I could return it.
1.0,"Wore them for one morning. I had planned to keep these at my work so I could wear winter boots back and forth. This was by noon on the first day. Amazon won’t refund unless I send them back, and I didn’t want to bother, because LOOK AT THEM. obnoxious. I’ll drop them off at a kohl’s but ridiculous."
1.0,Didn't work at all. I am top heavy but honestly a woman who wears a C cup or bigger this just won’t work for us. No matter what u see on the pictures it’s doesn’t hold up!
1.0,Two different size charts in item description. Color discoloration at neckline when received
1.0,"The product took weeks longer than estimated delivery date. The metal insert that is to go on the bridge of the nose that can be squeezed to fit the child's face is sewn in on the wrong end of the mask.  When worn to have the metal on the bridge of the nose the dinosaurs are upside down.  My kids think it looks funny and now is a fight to wear them to school.  Poor quality, took much longer than expected."
1.0,Cheap material- matches the cheap price though so you get what you paid for
1.0,Turned my wrist green and broke
1.0,I ordered a XL and it's still tight fitting. I wear a L in everything else or XL. Only this XL is to small. Wow!!!
1.0,keychain ring detached all of a sudden.
1.0,Sleeves are too short. Body is loose.  This picture shows it pulled back.  It is not tight.  I returned it.
1.0,"Not what they look like in picture. But fit well! They look more solid color, but aren't"
1.0,The material is very cheap and the color was not as expected. It's like shiny dance material. There is also a huge seam running up the front that I didn't notice in the photo. Very unflattering. Forget about returning it. They don't offer this but instead will give you a whole $4 back if you're lucky. Cross your fingers and hope you like them otherwise a total waste of money.
1.0,The glass came off within one day of use. The design is good and covers whole eye especially during driving but this has very low durability.
1.0,Literally broke in in three places within less than 1 hour of the first wear.
1.0,These pj's are not made from soft materials. The purpose of pj's is to relax in them and these are not comfortable. Made in China
1.0,There are faded spots on the back of the dress like someone spilled bleach on it
1.0,The severe defects was found after the lens was put on.  Feel like being cheated!!!  The seller should be removed from Amazon seller list.
1.0,We returned this shirt my husband didn't even out it on he put it up to his body and it clearly was too short & it was very thin. If washed it definitely would shrink.
1.0,Rivets fell off as soon as I took it out of packaging
1.0,"Super big up top, weird and super large around the hips!"
1.0,i disliked the product the earing posts were bent.
1.0,If I can put no star I would.  The rings didn't fit my hands. If you have tiny hands than the are perfect for you. I requested a refund and they didn't respond.
1.0,The umbrella came apart with the first use.
1.0,The lens have waves in them.  Makes you feel like you have something in your eye
1.0,"This bag is supposed to hold a computer, and it literally started to fall apart the moment I received with one of the two zippers breaking. Then within a month the handles stiches fell apart. Do not buy this bag (as cute as it is), unless you do not plan on using it with a computer."
1.0,Can only hold a cell phone it
1.0,One washing and they shrunk 3 sizes.  Could not even get them on my feet.
1.0,"Tall (5ft) 11 year old, this is too short"
1.0,Having trouble contacting the actual seller. Only option I have is to process a return through amazon.<br />The issue I have is that my eyebrow ring was stripped within days of receiving and wearing it. I have both pieces at the moment but occasionally have to use the bar to ensure my piercing hole stays open. I was hoping to speak to the company directly about sending a replacement before I send in my defective eyebrow ring.
1.0,"These lighted slippers work as advertised except for one huge, overwhelming flaw - the bottom is so heavy that the slippers fall off your feet when you try to walk.  This is a ridiculous design flaw that a little testing would have uncovered. I tried sewing the top to make them tighter, but they still fell off.  Finally, I went to a fabric store and bought a one inch wide elastic strap that I sewed on the back to wrap around my heel.  They stay on now, but I give them one star because the customer should not have to fix a product to make it work."
1.0,"The sizes do not match the actual sizes as expected - not true sizes, way too small and wrinkly fabric"
1.0,"Awful fabric. Not cotton as advertised. Slippery feel, and WAAAAY too small. Sized for a child, but long enough for someone who is 6'5'."
1.0,These gloves aren't like the photo provided - they are cheap and thin and ripped the second time I wore them. They do not have a wrist clasp or seams on the back of the hand.
1.0,really bad quality and sizing. They don't know what they are doing with woman clothes
1.0,"I will have to loss some weight before it will fit.  Everything I've order before in this size always fit, not sure way this one does not."
1.0,They have it listed at free returns. That was not the case. I’m being asked to pay for shipping back to china! Late response from customer service too. The vest was too baggy to be an XS.
1.0,"These glasses are so huge, and poor quality;  I thought they must have been designed for an green alien, with huge almond bug eyes, and from another planet. Don't bother, they are so huge that they didn't make it out of the flimsy envelope, it broke right at the bridge.<br /><br />They are so cheap i wont bother even waeste my time to return them.<br /><br />No, no, no."
1.0,Such a sad waste of every penny. I am not a small girl – I am 5'6&#34; tall and 240 pounds. I wear an XL or a 2x and my bra size is 42 D  but based on everyone's comments I went ahead and ordered a 5X and hoped it wasn't going to swim on me. For the record – 450 pound people can wear a 5X  in the real world. I received the bra today and I could tell when it came out of the package that it was ridiculously small. It wouldn't even go around me and the cup size was about a full C.  I am so sad because I was really looking forward to having a front zip bra. Now I need to go through the hassle of returning it immediately. I put my hand in the photo below to show scale. Ha ha- the cup isn't even a handful.
1.0,"Once I finally got them on, they easily feel off. Unfortunately the short time they adhered to the lenses, I couldn't get rid of the bubbles no matter how long I tried which caused them to be utterly useless."
1.0,"Not at all the advertised glasses , maybe not at all ANSI RATED lenses"
1.0,"I did not buy mine from Amazon, but from a store... and they broke before I ever used them."
1.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and was sadly disappointed.  First off, the dress itself is very cheaply made (loose threads, stitching poor) and I doubt it would last very long.  Secondly, it is extremely long and, unless you're a seamstress, you'll need to have it shorten or wear very high heels.  Although I loved the pattern on the material, as soon as I put it on I knew I would be sending it back.  I just won't pay for poorly made dresses."
1.0,"the zipper popped open before i even left the house, not because it was too small.  very disappointed the dress was so cute."
1.0,Looks adorable couldn't wait for it to arrive only to find I could not get it into my ear because the bull head does not move or come off.
1.0,Purchased this when it was blatantly false advertised as a natural stone. It's as fake as can be. So disappointing. And now I'm stuck having to drop it off at ups to return. Annoyed.
1.0,These don’t have a long enough piece of Velcro to tighten to your foot.  They run wide.  They’re too loose on my feet and slip off when I walk.  The arch support wasn’t very noticeable either.  I returned these.
1.0,This way misleading they are not the size they say at all i got a 2/3x and i was given almost like a large or medium didnt even go over my thighs so if your a big girl and have big thighs dont even waste the time and money.
1.0,This has to be the worse dress I have ever seen.  It was very wrinkled and just looked very cheap and the way it hung on me sure did not make me feel pretty.  Not the dress I would ever wear for my wedding anniversary.<br />It looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,Fots horrible
1.0,Definitely does NOT look anything like dolphins. Very disappointed. The 1 star was for the fast shipping
1.0,I will never buy this bra again. It does not push up your breast like advertised. It does not stick very long either. I bought this for a wedding to go under my strapless dress and I ended up going braless because this bra was an absolute fail.
1.0,"This is the second suit Iv received, I first ordered the red in M, and it was too small so I returned it. I'm 5' 120lbs... I ordered the black next since the red was out, and this time I got a large. And now the bottoms aren't high waisted! I'm not happy about it and will be returning this suit. Buy at your own risk"
1.0,Too heavy for my earlobes.<br />Returner it.
1.0,Faded day one
1.0,Looks cotton but is more like polyester. Not cute
1.0,It’s not a miracle worker. Very thin and flimsy.
1.0,Didn't like this item.
1.0,Poor quality feels like a pillow case
1.0,The outfit itself could have been adorable but it was full of gray marking pencil spots<br />that won't come out without fading the pink fabric. How could they send that out to<br /> a customer and think that it's acceptable??<br />Not a snap crotch so you have to pull the entire outfit down to change a diaper...too inconvenient.
1.0,"The pants were fine when I wore then for the first time, but when I went to put them on a second time, I noticed a “run” like you would find in stockings - like maybe one thread had pulled out or something? I figured it was no big deal and would just be a minor defect that no one would notice.  But when I wore them the third time, the “run” ripped wide open while I was out with my family.  Super embarrassing!!! I would not recommend buying these because they are obviously not well made. I’ve never had anything like this happen before and I have owned A LOT of leggings!"
1.0,"Worst.....I regret buying this chain,turned black under 24 hours.shame"
1.0,The stitching looks extremely cheap. I am returning this.
1.0,I really dont know if it was too large or too small. the elastic kept rolling up on me. So I would constantly have to pull it down or unroll it. I tried wearing it inside out to see if that would alleviate the rolling...I was displeased with this item
1.0,Cheap looking and doesn' t feel good on hands... 9$ is expensive ... upto 3$ would have been fine......will return !
1.0,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas to replace a very worn out one. We recently went on vacation and he used it for the first time. After one day, the lining ripped inside of several of the pocket areas and a zipper got stuck. Thumbs down!"
1.0,"Poor quality for the price. Customer service is terrible, and will not accept returns or offer refunds. Leggings are thin, cheap and not squat proof and will not withstand any serious workout other than gym selfies."
1.0,"Pésima calidad, además llegó dañado."
1.0,The seam in the front of the open cardigan was stitched crooked. It wouldn't lay flat on the one side. The fabric was puckering!
1.0,My Wife didn't even have the ring for a week before a stone fell out and it chipped. So not pleased with this company or this ring. I will not recommend or go back.
1.0,I was initially excited as they look nice but they tore after first use between the 2 fingers.  Very disappointing as I hoped they were quality and would have some durability.  They are soft and that may be why the durability is so poor either that or I got a lemon.
1.0,Took forever to arrive - fake buttons - feels awful to wear
1.0,"The headband was meant for Halloween, but was late. When it arrived, it looked nothing like the one I ordered."
1.0,"This suit is tiny. Even the bottom was smaller than expected. If you have breasts or anything larger than a flat, elongated back, this suit will not fit. Returned."
1.0,Horrible. I’m so upset that I wish I would have never spent the extra money for it to ship faster. It’s extremely small on the legs and it’s tight everywhere except for my thighs the hand glove fingers are very long and I just wish I would’ve saved my money. So much for the cat woman cosplay I was planning.
1.0,"Lesser quality material, not up to standards of other products, online show's it as beige, actually is camel tan. Size is fairly accurate."
1.0,Totally not the right color and it’s definitely not oversized. The only thing right with it is the design. Waste of money
1.0,"I owned the original v1 bag however it was unfortunately stolen. I replaced it with this version that I have just received a it is inferior in quality and design in every aspect to the original. it is very apparent they have cut a lot of corners to produce a lower cost item with better margin.  I am very disappointed, I hope they return to the brand I originally loved however until then I am returning this bag."
1.0,one shoe stays on for five minutes and goes off. The other shoe quit working all together first time he worn  them. He is very disappointed in them. So am I. I think I will be returning them.
1.0,I bought almost every single color in the shirts. So far this is the only color shirt that fit smaller than the others.Also after a few washes they’ve gotten some pilling. Too bad because I really liked the fit of the shirt!
1.0,Smaller size<br />Don’t looks like a picture 😳
1.0,"I  just did not the material very thin and not even the pattern I  ordered, super unflattering. Overall a cheap dress"
1.0,They where very uncomfortable and kept sliding off my feet.
1.0,They are not high waisted pants so I was very disappointed !<br />They are  stretchy and comfortable but NOT high waisted
1.0,"Very cheaply made, not worth the money. Ad says great for period costume but received children's size. No where in the ad does it state children's. Will be returning ASAP for refund."
1.0,I received this with about half of the crystals in the plastic envelope - NOT on the earrings!
1.0,Didn't last a week.  Material tore quickly
1.0,"Looks like a pack of factory seconds.  inconsistent stitching, each shirt hangs differently, yeah, not bad for the price, just not great either.<br /><br />update:  these don't last.  each subsequent wash magnifies all the defects inherent to the shirt.  they're all cut-off length now.  in the trash they go."
1.0,Both bracelets are not worth the money. Very disappointed ! To the garbage..
1.0,They fall apart in less than a month. You get what you pay for...
1.0,"The dress is very poorly made, the fabric is super cheap, definitely not worth the price.  The lace portion over the tan underlying dress was covered in holes throughout the dress."
1.0,Did not like the fabric it is not as pictured. I returned it.
1.0,Looks cheep 😕
1.0,"Not Cotton.  Wish Amazon would fix their search engine as this shirt popped up in a search for cotton tank tops.  This shirt is definitely not cotton, some sort of nylon."
1.0,Esta enorme !!<br />Para nada es como lo imaginaba<br />La tela y la confección del vestido no es para nada como los otros vestidos de Michael Kors que he comprado
1.0,"Don't buy this bra. Less than a year after I got it, the underwires came out. This was after I treated the bra with kid gloves. I'd expect this from a $50 bra, but not one I spent $150 on. I don't know why this company has such a good reputation."
1.0,"I was so disappointed in the sizing. I ordered a Large, but it looks more like small. Ended up giving it to my very thin daughter."
1.0,Way too small! I ordered a size 5 and what came was practically a size 2!  Would not ordered from these folks again.
1.0,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
1.0,The sizes on this jacket is at least two sizes off (Extremely small) It must be made for people in China.
1.0,I previously reviewed this product based on the quality of the product I received. The color was not good. There were white lines in the material. The dress is about a medium but was marked as an XL. There is a tear in the seam at the pocket.  This was an honest review. I had ordered this dress based on the rave reviews from other customers so I was surprised at the poor quality. Then I received an email from the company asking me to remove my bad review since they will do better in the future. This is probably why there is nothing but good reviews for a poor quality product. I probably should have just returned the product when I saw it but I was shocked after reading all the 5 star ratings. the problem with removing an honest review is that it causes other people to have the same experience I have. So I am not removing my review and will see if this one is allowed to be posted.
1.0,"hese are good yoga pants, but aren't the ones shown. The ones that were sent to me have subtle thick horizontal lines, and are somewhat see-through.  Also, I was very keen on not wanting the vertical hem line on the outside leg trim, and these came with the stitch line from hip to pant bottoms. I really don't care for them."
1.0,This shirt was extremely too small. I ordered a 2x . I couldn't get half way into it. I ordered a 1x from China.-different shirt but same material as well. It fits great.
1.0,Was not what I received
1.0,It broke the first time I tried to wear it. Completely ripped in half.
1.0,"The only reason I bought this item was to have a better understanding if a real one would look good or not. I had to bend the two bars together more so that it would look even semi real, but even then it is too wide. From the angle that I took that picture, it looks okay… but any other way you look, you can tell it’s very obviously fake. So to conclude, it’s too wide and I’ll be returning it. Also it does hurt to take out after wearing it for awhile."
1.0,The image is blurry on the mask and there is no real/ realistic glitter; just a blurr
1.0,Poor quality<br />Too small for my 9 year old
1.0,We thought we were getting just two separate gangs but it came in a full denture it broke in half before I could even put them on don't guys these
1.0,Didn't fit at all. The part you lead into the piercing with is way too short
1.0,No where near the right size. I normally wear a 34 C and I ordered this in a 40 C but it’s no where near the right size.
1.0,"This is an illegal counterfeit knock off shirt, so you will get what you pay for.  theChive doesn't sell on Amazon.  You have to buy direct from The Chivery.  Don't buy this knock off, it's garbage."
1.0,muy pequeño parese que es para niños
1.0,"Very cheap quality, frame came off. Broke in pieces."
1.0,"This product was terrible.  Putting it on, if you pulled too hard it tore.  Your fingers will also make a hole in them."
1.0,"The color is off white, I order the apricot color. The sleeves are to short."
1.0,this hoodie looks nothing like the picture and is horrible material. it’s so thin and cheap looking so don’t waste your money. For sure returning.
1.0,"Looks fake, cheap buttons, donated to church."
1.0,I went to finally put this dress on and found a hole in the back of the sleeve.  Unfortunately my return window is closed.  I am so disappointed in the quality.  I ordered early to make sure I would have it here for a special occasion and now I can’t even wear it.
1.0,So cheap looking.
1.0,Came apart after two weeks
1.0,This dress has a funny smell.  Need to wash before wear.  The button is hard to button..need a bigger hole so the button can go through! I will be sending this back!
1.0,i was in love with these pants when i seen them when they finally arrived i tried them on and they are extremely tight for a mens large i could barley get them over my hips and forget about trying to sit down i was afraid i may have split the pants if i sat down took so long to get her just for me to send them back
1.0,It looks different from advertised and frankly it was at least 2-3 sizes bigger than what i usually wear in all stores. i'm a 10.5 by the way
1.0,These band keepers are EXTREMELY Cheaply made and will tear putting them on if you are not careful.  These were not as thick as my original keepers (which Broke).  More Cheap Chinese C@^p.  Stay away from these.  You've been warned
1.0,"Fits okay but, some parts were not sewn properly."
1.0,No shape to dress and icky material.
1.0,Not that I expected some glorious piece of jewelry but it slipped off my hand into my palm a lot and looked like deal anyways. I ended up not wearing it for halloween which is what I purchased it for.
1.0,As much as I would like to return this item I am unable to do it because it was for a present. The reason has nothing to do with the necklace but with the false advertisement. The package came with a little card for a free necklace and all I had to do was enter the Bogo code provided when you email the vendor. Well the code was provided however does not work. I contacted the vendor via email and is being two weeks and I am still waiting for them to reply being the reason why I decided to write a review reporting the false advertisement.
1.0,Had the quality of the dress & not true to size no way near a plus size dress...
1.0,Both watch straps broke within 2 weeks. However the magnet was very strong and the watch band was very comfortable for the total of the 4 weeks I was able to wear them.
1.0,"The shoes look awesome!  We gave them to our son for his birthday in June.  After about 5 weeks, we realized that one shoe is a size 5 and the other is a size 6!  It subtle and not something I noticed until he was bragging to his twin sister about his shoe size being a 6...when I corrected him, as I ordered the shoes.  We were shocked that they were different.  I didn't think to check, just assumed they were right.  Now I feel like a fool for paying $100 for mis-matched shoes!"
1.0,Don't recommend! Broke in first use
1.0,"The first order I was missing a stone so I requested a replacement and the box was all ripped up and taped back together and the ""opals"" are two completely diffent colors. I am afraid to get another replacement. I love the design but the ""opals"" are not like the picture and twice I've recieved unsatisfactory plugs."
1.0,This item is MUCH smaller than I expected. I even ordered 2 sizes bigger than I usually wear and it is STILL too small! Very disappointed.
1.0,Very polyester feel!!!
1.0,"Cute outfit, fits great! Came with no headband.!! Very disappointed"
1.0,"This hoodie is not oversized at all. It’s a nice material but not loose, fits very snug. Definitely order up in size and it’s not long it’s more on the shorter size in length."
1.0,Sorry for the bad review but it broke my boyfriends ears out and that has never happened till now. May just throw them away.
1.0,"When I ordered this dress the first time, I ordered a size Large and received a size Small.  I processed the return and was told I would be sent a new dress in the correct size.  Instead, I received another size SMALL.  I gave them a 1 star because they obviously can’t read a size tag!  As for the dress, if you wear a size small, then order it.  It’s a very nice dress!"
1.0,Ya know they're supposed to b stainless steal they aren't tho  I'm allergic to anything but stainless n these broke my mouth out do they look cool yes but that doesn't make them functional.... It ends up being a waste if you're allergic to jank jewelry which I am but they said they weren't someone lied about what they had online imagine that lol.
1.0,These earrings are cute but so cheaply made they all fell apart after only wearing them a few times.
1.0,Wayyyyyy too tight
1.0,This s*** 💩 was way to small
1.0,"Used it twice.  Worked once (sort of on a bit of oatmeal) but not twice.  The 2nd was a pure white cotton t shirt. Stain still there, and I did 3 times.  Stain was very small, from a tiny bit of chicken grease. I used it right away, but it didn't work.  Tried again the next morning, and it's still there.  Probably hard to removed from anything white."
1.0,"This item is very cheaply made and not practical for most watches. It is very poorly designed for its purpose. I regularly remove and add watch links and I had high hopes for this  when I ordered it but the first time I used it I knew it was not designed properly. The most important part of removing any links is that the band has to be perfectly lined up with the pin pusher. The pin pushers are very fine metal and the tips will break if they are at any kind of angle. This device virtually assures the band will be at at tilt  and therefore there is a very good likelihood that the pin removal tip will break off and that is exactly what happened the first time I used it. There is almost no way to lie a watch band on this device to get a straight in push. With the Plier type link removal tool I usually use, I break a tip off maybe every 100th watch. This one broke the tip the first time.  So its back to my link removal pliers! On the positive side it only cost me about $6.00 so I am not out much but I should have known it was too good to be true!"
1.0,"Horrible,  never got the clasp open due to it being put on crocked."
1.0,The picture shows L bars there not they have the lil ball on the end of it and there too short
1.0,Changed color not real silver
1.0,I order a bigger size and for it to fit tight not happy
1.0,The length was too short. Barely covered my backside. The sleeves felt cheap and itchy. Was not impressed.
1.0,The XL is way too small.  Check US equivalent before purchasing this
1.0,"I purchased these undergarments for a trip, the lease is very hard, and started tearing up, very unsatisfied with these products. I’ve also ordered them 3X, they were very very tight, as if it was a large. I had to do more spending the night expected."
1.0,The posts are weak and snapped. Don’t buy.
1.0,"Awful, cup size is wrong need to purchase 2 sizes bigger than your actual. I had to wear it because I had a backless dress and had no choice. Most uncomfortable bra I ever had."
1.0,No me agrado. Material muy baja calidad.<br />Y pésimo acabado.
1.0,The quality is not good. The slipper material started ripping after a week of purchase.
1.0,I didn't like it .......i gave it away.
1.0,Hated it! Didn't look like the picture at all....Looked cheap....
1.0,This product is waste of time it not the same as pic however  its very short bought  mother and daughter
1.0,They were not YELLOW. They were LIME GREEN AND RED. Please do not put a description saying yellow when they definitely are not.  I thought maybe my computer lighting was off a bit and that's why they looked a littlegreen but nope.<br /><br />Definitely going to send back. Needed them for a costume and green would not match at all. Very disappointed
1.0,Looks great but it will not stay buckled. Constantly slips a complete waist of money.
1.0,All of the post fell off
1.0,Top was not oversized. It was just longer than a regular tshirt. I even bought a larger sized than what I normally wear and it was snug in the chest.
1.0,Really cute for a moment but almost immediately the gem fell out. I re-glued it but the loop connecting it to the key chain broke a few days later. Over all not happy with the product.
1.0,Too stiff and doesn’t stretch. I returned it.
1.0,Had to cut it off. Latch stuck in last position and would not release.  Save your money. Buy traditional belts.
1.0,I ordered hat with USA colored fish.  Received the correct color hat material but with a dark blue fish.  What I received wasn’t even a choice option!  t’s not what I ordered.  But today I’m giving as gift and do not have time to return it but certainly will if the recipient does not like it.  Disappointing!<br /><br />I decided to return first hat since it was not same as advertised.  Received the second hat today and it is same as the first.  So do not buy unless your okay getting something that isn’t what you ordered!
1.0,Two sizes too small and I cannot find return info.
1.0,I had to return these. I ordered a large and they came in and I couldn't even get over my hips. They looked more like a small. I'm 5'8&#34; and 170 lbs and I normally wear a large...not this time.
1.0,THIS ITEM IS NOTHING LIKE THE PIC AS FAR AS MATERIAL GOOO!!! Its a nylon material which IS NOT WHATS PICTURED IM ONE PISSED BRIDE!!!!
1.0,"This dress feels and looks cheap, and the quality is more like underwear. Very thin and wrinkled with strings hanging off the seams. It's also much longer than the photo. I'm 5'9, 150 lbs, and the medium hits me mid-knee."
1.0,Not for adults ...kids only
1.0,Itchy and doesn't hold shape once on.
1.0,"These masks are made of very thin foam.  There is no way these are machine washable and no way they will last five years.  Stay away, do not buy these masks.  They aren't worth even five cent a piece.  Complete junk and WAY WAY overpriced.  Junk at its finest.  Hate that I had to give even one star."
1.0,Necklace fell apart the 1st time I tried to put it on. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"There were not flexible at all.  While they fit into my nose hole, they were not able to be adjusted, so they stuck out. Looks horrible.  I ended up buying some from somewhere else."
1.0,"Way too long for a 5'3"""
1.0,Cheaply made & has bad odor. Sent back.
1.0,"They’re absolutely nothing like the picture. I thought I’d be getting cute sweatpants. They were weird, silky, camo pants."
1.0,"They were way too large on my son and the size I purchased was the size he wore also they were not quality looking leather like it is shown in the picture they were a completely different shoe . I was very disappointed , glad they had free shipping both ways ."
1.0,"Cheap looking and nothing like the picture.  no buckle band anywhere and buckle was painted on in a blue ugly color.  A square was sown in the flap middle, not around the edge as in picture.  I requested to return and receive a refund, but because I had a $10.00 courtesy coupon added to this order which had about 4 other items,  Amazon applied the coupon credit to this item and only sent me $0.1 as a refund.  Total disappointment."
1.0,"Not sure if I received the same shoes others are giving 4 or 5 stars for.<br /><br />1st they're a little tight, maybe half a size smaller than I expected. Heavy socks make them unwearable compared to other shoes I own. That's not the biggest issue though.<br /><br />They aren't particularly warm, at least in the toes. As soon as I put them on and go out I can feel cold air against my toes. I mean almost instantly. Sure my ankle is warm but can't ever remember being concerned about my ankles over my toes. Really can't remember having to.<br /><br />Not waterproof, not even water resistant. Water goes right through mine as if it were cloth/nylon. Ok for short trips in snow but wouldn't make a day of it with these shoes.<br /><br />Now to be honest I didn't expect too much. Bought these as an quick purchase because snow was coming and I didn't have time to actually shop, so that's on me. I just suggest thinking hard about these unless you're in need of a cheap, knock around boot you don't want to care about beyond 1, maybe half, a season."
1.0,"Supposed to be a women's large, was a men's large. Screen print not centered on shirt. Returned."
1.0,Sizes too small I ordered an extra large and that’s still small I’ll never order that again
1.0,"The product material  is not as shown in all the first pictures. I was very disappointed with the quality. It's a pale color in a stretch material. That becomes even paler if the material is a bit stretched. Better but a slightly bigger size ,loosely fitting. Deception"
1.0,Elastic waist is set too tight for the size.
1.0,squeaks hurts my feet had to get dr.scholls  now shoes does not fit properly it's been a month very disappointed
1.0,Felt cheap and did not feel good on
1.0,Hat too HOT  and itches when worn.. material is hot.. emblem is good though.. put emblem on another cap made from cotton and pls send me one.. will not recommend this cap to any of my fellow shipmates.. tks
1.0,"Very  bulky, cheap looking watch. Stay away..."
1.0,These were too tight to wear...tiny tiny pair of tights even though supposedly 24...get 3-4 sizes bigger...if you want to be able to wear them! Wasted my money...
1.0,"Brake easily, one time product"
1.0,Not designed for those with shoulder problems.
1.0,The size did not come close to matching your sizing chart suggestion.
1.0,"Rec'd the watch, it doesn't work, the rings around where the numbers would be have come loose and are sliding around on the inside of the watch I contacted customer support they have never gotten back to me I will not buy from this company again"
1.0,Product fell apart after 2 months of use. All the interior sleeves fell out.
1.0,"I am so disappointed in this 2 piece set, the blue in the top is navy blue and the stripes in the bottom are royal blue that don’t look good together at all this is why I don’t like ordering things they look one way when you see them and look another way when you get it it would be so nice if they were the same color, I hate that there are not matching 🙄☹️😞☹️😩😫"
1.0,To small had to return them
1.0,"I bought the copper one and although I liked it. It also arrived with big scratch across the front plate. As far as usability goes, the cards are a little bit difficult to pick out of the wallet."
1.0,"I have ordered these glasses twice both times they have come in used one had scratches on them and missing the plastic that go over the glasses when you get them, the little thing that goes on the glasses was on out side of case. Second had something splatter on it and the same things I had with first pair. The second pair came in some plastic bag that was sealed."
1.0,Super thin and cheap material. Also see through.
1.0,should be red and blue paint spots. It was black
1.0,Cheep used one week inside stitching came loose
1.0,Cheaply made and didn't fit
1.0,The adjustment side of the strap is on the front of the shirt.  Almost like someone sewed it together backwards.<br />It’s also extremely long
1.0,I was so excited I love red but I put it together and it connect correctly the magnet on the inside of my wrist instead of the outside like it shows on the pic and the connection part to the watch is way to lose and it could easily pop out
1.0,Before I even wore them. The bottom stone fell out on both pairs I ordered.
1.0,I have a small head and still this was super tight! I threw mine out. It gave me a headache!
1.0,These shirts are very cute in design.  However after once wash they discolored and the white one faded after only one wear (I separate clothes by color and wash delicate).
1.0,Ring is fake. It’s not sterling silver as described
1.0,"they look cool, but if you have a wrist the size of a young kid, these wont fit you"
1.0,Nothing like picture. Doesn’t fit right or hang as portrayed
1.0,"I was looking forward to this shirt, since it appears to be a nice cotton, black sleeveless with a little bit of extra color.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed.  First, the shirt part is so thin and cheap that “paper thin” would be a vast improvement.  It’s completely see-thru, due in large part to its low quality, and its light weave causes it to not fit in any way that is acceptable.  The waist will ride up and crinkle after just a few minutes of wear, the chest area sags and the parts that connect to the ribbon in the back are already tearing away.<br /><br />Add all of that to the fact that the not-too-attractive ribbon weighs 2x or more as much as the shirt.  Once you manage to get it on (no easy feat, believe me) you immediately realize that the tie in the back is dragging the shirt back over your shoulders - adding another dimension altogether to the weird fit.<br /><br />Maybe the best part is that it leaves tons and tons of black lint on everything it touches, which is ironic since it really had very little material to start with and can’t spare any.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I do NOT recommend this thing.  No attempt was made to create an even mid-level quality garment.  Look elsewhere."
1.0,"This item was placed on my toe since the day I received it. Today, for no reason, it just disintegrated. Not happy about this."
1.0,I missed the return window on these slippers.  Who wants slippers you can’t wash and u can’t wash these.  You can fluff them whatever that means.  Bad purchase!
1.0,Can't believe I wore this twice and look at how the buckle destroyed the tan section of the belt.. I want a refund..
1.0,Very heavy weight straw that doesn't move it all very stiff and uncomfortable.
1.0,Poor quality and the size is immensely large. About 3 sizes larger than normal
1.0,"3 out of 4 clamps broke during the first day of usage. We think perhaps our garage was too cold and the plastic just snapped as soon as pressure was applied, but seriously?!"
1.0,"This shirt was sent to me, while delivery was faster then expected it had no tags on it, and had deodorant stains on the sides. The fit was a little looser then I imagined it would have been."
1.0,Size running small.
1.0,Not all the same size!!!!!
1.0,"I'm 4 10, 100lbs and bought the small. It was way too loose and long. I should've known better."
1.0,Pésima calidad.  HORRIBLE
1.0,worst thing I've ever bought...so ugly
1.0,"I bought 3 of these belts for a flight to California and only 1 survived the trip.<br />  The clip broke on the green one, and the orange one was frayed almost in half.<br />  I was going to return them, but &#34;the window of return has closed&#34;."
1.0,This dress looks used its faded and the red has blue into pink in places. Very disappointed in the difference in the picture and the product I received
1.0,I can't find my packet  i don't know what is going on with this.
1.0,I had this wig on for about 5 minutes when the side pieces started to fall down. This is a one-wear item. Disappointing due to the price.
1.0,This blazer is not sized like the picture. It is not as oversized (in regards to length) as the picture shows. Width-wise is oversized but definitely wish it was a little longer. Quality is good so I’ll be keeping it but just disappointed in the length.
1.0,Did not fit correctly
1.0,Price is good but  my kid could only use this for 10 days and then it torn apart.
1.0,I am of average height (5’5”) but this shirt was WAY too short on me - fell above my pants.
1.0,Didn't fit top or bottem  no molding bar and I didnt receive instructions with wit. Dont care how much it cost. Waist of money.
1.0,Wore 2xs and one of the buckets broke off and a shoe string broke
1.0,I was so excited to give this to my daughter for her birthday.  She got 1 day of use out of it before the screen cracked while she was wearing it :(
1.0,"I received the wrong color. The material is ""alright"". Dont buy it. No very fashionable."
1.0,"I have ordered several dresses over the  summer and greatly disappointed. My conclusion is there is some highly skilled Photo Shopping and/or lighting (editing) to make products appear higher quality than it actually is!  Or the material in the display is absolutely a higher quality, different material.  This dress the material was not suitable to wear in public! A slip would have been visible."
1.0,"This watch is disgustingly cheep, even a  jeweler couldn’t remove the links without damaging the link. Total rip off"
1.0,Horrible. Save your money. Wish I didn't have to give that one star
1.0,Does not flatter and its looks frumpy
1.0,I don’t see how these could fit anyone’s teeth and they bent very easily.
1.0,"The material was soft, but the product is to small"
1.0,"It was so Tiny, you couldn’t see the sloth<br />Very disappointed, I bought it for a gift and<br />Did not give it"
1.0,The top part did not stay on and I eventually lost it. :-(
1.0,This necklace was cute but I could only use it for a day because it broke. I wore it all day at school and the little bulb part fell off by the end of the day. It wasn't like I was tugging on it or anything it just came off. I wouldn't recommend
1.0,Came crushed and very tight.
1.0,Great fit but the fabric was very thin and no lining
1.0,Very poor quality return.
1.0,vuarnet uses glass or organic lenses exclusively .  not plastic as per their web site.
1.0,"It’s too big in some areas, too small in others. Not very good quality. Maybe I just got a one off."
1.0,Too small to fit the IPhone
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Wish I would have read the reviews. Do not order!
1.0,Dress runs small.6
1.0,Back strap wore out after 1 week
1.0,I prefer a loose fit so I bought a 2XL (I wear a XL) shirt fits like a large. I figured it would be cheap but the material is very uncomfortable.
1.0,"After having purchased a number of pieces of jewelry on Amazon, I was very disappointed in the quality of these earrings.  I actually purchased them to match the heart shaped pendant that I had already purchased ( which I really like).  I would not put these earring in the same category.  The are very chintzy looking, in my opinion.  Not worth the money I pad for them.  I did not try to return them as I misplaced the paperwork."
1.0,"Bought this sandal a little more than a month ago. Love the color and style and that they fit my daughter well while she played (they allow for more mobility and stay on better than a cheap pair of flip flips). However, they have had more than one issue in their construction. First, the toe strap came unstitched, so the were unusable until I sewed them back together. I contacted the company and they assured me each shoe goes through a rigorous quality assurance check. Not sure how we got the one defective pair because that week, the entire ankle strap ripped off, along with a chunk of the foam sole. No fixing that!<br />Ultimately, the shoes are useless and I'll have to look for something else for this summer. Disappointed and couldn't recommend this shoe."
1.0,"Sizing wrong, too small"
1.0,"Very disappointed in this product.  Like the idea, but not executed right."
1.0,The opening on the top is too wide.  Your boobs will fall out of it no matter what size they are
1.0,First day or so they were comfortable to wear but after 4 days of usage they already got flatten. This is very disappointing because I only wore them indoor with moderate walking. I will be returning these.
1.0,"Cheaply made, can't sit down in it at all."
1.0,"Shiny material, runs small. Very disappointed."
1.0,They fit great. Only one problem. I ordered grey and one of the three is grey. The other two are borderline dark grey/black. Really wanted three grey ones. Also forgot to mention that one of the leggings had a quarter size hole in them.
1.0,"arrived and as soon as i took out of package it had a LARGE HOLE on the side of the stitching. instead of returning it, i just got it fixed. i do like the way it fits. its oversized great with leggings. not the most comfy but i enjoy the look of this. especially after a large meal haha!"
1.0,"The size small is listed as 30-34&#34;.  The belt may be 34&#34; from end to end, but when buckled using the last hole (for the largest waist size) it is barely 30&#34; in circumference.  The small would not fit any waist larger than 30&#34;.  Also, the belt isn't flat as I had expected.  It is thick and rounded, which adds about an inch to the appearance of my waist.  Very unflattering."
1.0,Waaay too small for an adult head. Waste
1.0,"Broke as I was putting on the first time. Bummed out as it was very pretty, but cheaply made."
1.0,I wear a 3X very loose 6' 2&#34; 290lbs. So when I saw runs small I got a 4X. Large guys shouldn't even look at the company's shirts . They most make shirts for little people became my 8 year old can almost fit this shirt.
1.0,I really wanted to love this shirt but I could barely fit into it. I am normally a medium and ordered a medium but seems to be 2 to 3 sizes too small.  Possibly Asian sizing.
1.0,No tenía un acabado prolijo
1.0,It make it look like there are a lot of socks in the picture and there’s two pairs
1.0,Terrible quality! Straps and buckles are bright white... Top and sides of shoe were wrinkled from packaging.
1.0,DO NOT BUY! This is a terrible purchase. I bought this top thinking it had a liner but it was completely see through and just super weird and awkward.
1.0,"It was cute at first until I got on a (cold) flight and noticed that there was this light brown stuff melted all over my hoodie. As the flight went on I noticed the stuff was getting on my chair, pants, seatbelt, everything. Eventually my husband realized that the “stuff” was actually the lining of the backpack melting off (the lining surrounding the front pikachu specifically). You can see in the first picture that you can actually pinch and mold the material—and THAT was cooling the backpack off a bit. We were not in a hot climate, and even if we were a backpack shouldn’t be melting? I requested a refund and was denied because it was past the 30 day mark… even though this product is obviously defective."
1.0,I'm quite sure this is a fake vera Bradley wallet. Additionally the zipper gets stuck and it's incredibly difficult to pull out a card from the plastic section of the wallet.
1.0,Not satisfied. . .
1.0,"Too small for my face. This mask restricts my nasal passages and I struggle to breath, even when I loosen the Velcro. Haven't used it since I bought it and used it the one time."
1.0,Too thin! Your sizes are very different on all clothing
1.0,"1/2 came already broken, not the colors listed in the picture, wrong size. It came in the mail quickly and was cheap that was about all that was good about the product. Still not worth the price plus shipping."
1.0,"Prior to the black cord locks, I purchased a 20 piece package of two-hole cord locks that were clear. I have black fabric masks that are STILL wearable; just excessively worn. The difference between the black and colorless ones was size — the black double - holed cord locks were bigger than the clear.<br /><br />It was uncomfortable with the lock pressed against the back of my ear. And they were noticeable. The smaller, glass-like colored cord locks were barely visible by sight and touch.<br /><br />I am going to reuse them for my laundry bags and pajama shorts with drawstrings."
1.0,"Too short and the material after 1st wash on gentle cycle  it,<br />Completely became shreds! Don’t buy"
1.0,Not fit to size.
1.0,"No support, and poorly constructed if you're busty."
1.0,This watch lasted less than a year before it completely died.  It looks good but is not made to last.  I would stay away from Fossil watches.
1.0,Hollpw on the inside. No stamp of surgical stainless steel....no stamp at all that it's real steel. The inside is sharp so if you pull your ring out it hurts in the inside. Actually you might even scrape it if you pulled in an angle. Also consider all the soap and dirt that's going to settle in the hollow space inside.<br />Oh well it was only 5 dollars.<br />Returned.
1.0,"The designs look nice, but they do not have a finished edge, and they were super thin. Fun looking designs but not usable for Covid safety."
1.0,didn't glow like the pictures
1.0,It was way too big for our kids
1.0,"It is larger than expected with a bad look on the body, and it's bad material like plastic. The color goes off when washing even with only cold water! It's not even fit but it shows my bras. I don't recommend it even to my enemy :("
1.0,"The piece of metal that connects the two halves, that goes through the hole in the watch band, is too short to even fit through it. Even when it’s off my wrist it’s too short to close it in place. So I can’t even wear it."
1.0,Bonitos pero llegaron manchados defectuosos 👎🏻
1.0,The threads on these do not hold the ball on..this is terrible while in the middle of a conversation my balls fall off and now I lost one already. Waste of money
1.0,"ordered the same size as before and these are 5 inches shorter!! can't wear them, they'll go to Goodwill"
1.0,Wrong size sent. Super disappointed. They seem comfy for the price but they're at least 2 sizes too large. :(
1.0,These shorts are made like a cheap garment and are very expensive! One thread came loose and the entire drawstring came out of the waistband!
1.0,"The speakers seem to charge but don't work and I can't find replacements. Not sure if it's the battery, can't find a replacement battery to solder in either. Good luck."
1.0,I bought this because the picture looked like the jeans are long and skinny type. Definitely not what I received. Above my ankle and the cut of the boot was ugly.
1.0,Can not keep it fastened and the length is longer
1.0,Broke off in my hand!
1.0,Like having a plastic bag over your mouth
1.0,I'm embarrassed to have purchased this garbage but would have been irredeemably mortified if I had been the one who sold it.
1.0,Much smaller than indicated
1.0,I ordered a medium. I am 5'4 125 pounds. It was extremely small. I should have ordered an XL
1.0,"I ordered adult XL. I have a son who weighs around 135 pounds, these tank tops are even WAAAAAAY to small for him!!!!!"
1.0,"Product received is nothing like advertised . The top’s length is short , neck pattern is entirely different, no buttons in front, instead has buttons at the back to close the collar neck. Disappointed! Returning it."
1.0,I never wear this ring it looks so cheap.
1.0,Very rough feel. I know it was inexpensive and wasn't expecting something out of this world but it feels cheap and not soft at all as one would expect for something described as fleece. For the price there are many other options I suggest trying one of those instead.
1.0,Item came full of what looks like black dog hairs as well as long blonde hairs. Im disgusted to say the least. Returning it.
1.0,frayed and fell apart the first time it was worn. Total waste of money.
1.0,Runs very small in size. Quality of shirt is not what it appears in the picture
1.0,Not a sweat shirt definitely a terrible fabric  Not happy
1.0,"It’s a beautiful dress but when I put it on the day of my graduation, the strap broke! I was really sad."
1.0,I took a chance ordering this since I hoped it would do a good job of staying on the head during physical exercise unfortunately it worked the same as the cheaper ones or should I say didn't work. It soaked up sweat and as soon as it was wet with my sweat it fell off continuously after 10 minutes and wouldn't stay on.
1.0,Paper thin. Bad
1.0,"This is a very cute hair piece - and a nice alternative to a LONG lot of loose Rapunzel hair for a little girl.  That said - the circumference is TINY.  To boot, the plastic band snapped when my daughter (who is only 4 - and hardly has much strength) was pushing it down onto her head.  I am hopeful I can figure some fix out before Halloween (do NOT want to purchase another).  Seller got the item here quickly (thank you!) - but quality is POOR.  My daughter is devastated, to say the least..."
1.0,"Ordered my normal size small, and I got it and it was like a triple xl.."
1.0,the XL is more like an XXXsmall!!  my 4 yr old wives 45 lbs and is tall and the waist on the pants barely fit her!!!  never passing again!
1.0,"Way too thick, it's like applying a piece of gum to your mustache."
1.0,The shipping box and contents were well packaged but the mask was apparently folded in half and broken into 3 pieces..
1.0,"Cheap. Simply cheap. It broke about five times since I tried it on. I repaired it multiple times, but it still broke.  In addition, it discolors against my skin. I regret to inform you that this piece of jewelry is no longer gold. It's not worth it. DO NOT spend your money on this item!! Keep scrolling honey. Even if you have to spend a few more dollars for a more durable and well-connected item, please do. Don't waste time viewing this item any longer or contemplating whether or not you should proceed to purchase. Simple answer: DON'T!! On to the next."
1.0,"This is like putting a cheap nylon poncho on. And trying to return it was going to be a mess, so it became a gag gift, with instructions to keep it away from heat, as it just might melt!<br />Please don't waste your money!!"
1.0,Not as cute as pictured. Quite large actually. I wish I would have known you can’t return them before purchasing. Yuck
1.0,As you can see water sticks to it and hat get wet over time. Some of the water runs off but hat absorbs the rest.
1.0,They run small and are very stiff and uncomfortable.
1.0,I hate these earrings the post are short and they are so thin that they don't fit any earring backs.  They feel very insecure. I wished I would have returned them.
1.0,"If you think you will receive a regular length cotton T-shirt, think again!! This is made out of some cheap silky polyester, not cotton. It is also a mid-length, boxy cut. Like a longer crop top. It is manufactured in and ships from China. If you don't like it and want a refund, you will have to fight for it!"
1.0,Very cute and stylish but the screw come loose too easy and I’ve just lost it and my car key won’t fit on the ring part by itself
1.0,"The first vest i was sent did not come with a battery.  The 2nd one did not work at all.  I used the battery from the 2nd one for the first order and it sorta worked, however,  the vest is so glitchy!  When I first plug in the charged battery,  without turning it on,  I can already feel the heat.  When I do turn it on,  it will either shut off automatically,  or it'll give me about 10 minutes of heat before it decides to shut off.  I keep having to unplug the vest from the battery and re-plug it back in."
1.0,"I bought these thinking they would be right for my Achilles tendinitis, since the ones I usually wear were out of stock.  Big mistake!  These socks made the pain worse!!  Too much of a nuisance to send back, but am very disappointed.  Would not recommend... keep looking!"
1.0,"The shoes really do fit well, but unfortunate they lasted less then 2 months 😒 For the price... should have lasted at least 6 months. Kids grow, but not that fast."
1.0,Unfortunately the buckles are pretty bad. It looks amazing but the buckles do not close correctly. Pretty sad.
1.0,Not recommended for medium or long hair. It smushes your curls and not all of my hair fit in it.
1.0,"It’s very cute, but it was wayyy too tight in the chest/shoulder area. It did not fit. I would size up."
1.0,was not the size we requested and messed up y daughter's halloween costume
1.0,"Poor quality and hung like a sack on my body. The fabric is very clingy and unflattering. And it was way too big for the size described. Find something else to buy, not this!"
1.0,nothing at all like the pic
1.0,This shirt would be good if it was t too tight way to small
1.0,"They were very pretty, I was unable to wear them because they were bent when they arrived."
1.0,"The white dress was more silver than anything, but unfortunately the bottom was poorly put together. The band on the skirt was twisted upon arrival, the skirt went down past the knee, etc. sucks because it was meant to be a New Years party outfit."
1.0,"Returned this item.  Not as pictured.  Interior was beige, not leather and not well made."
1.0,"THE PRINT ON THESE 3 ITEMS, COLOR, NOR PATTERN MATCH"
1.0,This item is cut very small and the quality of the material is horrible. DO NOT waste your time.
1.0,Attractive appearance and style BUT can't wear them. The wires are far too short to go through an earlobe let alone close. Buyer beware and see other similar reviews. Not worth the time and expense to return so off to Goodwill with these.
1.0,The shorts were soft and fit super well but when I washed them the black bled into the white seams. I tried to wash again to get the color out but it didn’t work. Super cheap don’t waste your money.
1.0,poor service from this vender wrote them on 2 diffrent days about the bad quality they  do not have a good product mine fell apart the first day and now I have nothing  to pass on a waste of time and money this company does nothing to help
1.0,More like knee highs. Very thin material. Always rolls down.
1.0,I bought this for my granddaughter it looks like something you would see and a garage sell . It was Faded and had dirt on it in fact the sleeves were rolled up and looks like it had mustard stain on it . I have bought  several clothing items from Amazon I will be very hesitant to ever get anything again
1.0,"The lace fabric does not drape well and the cut of the garment is awkward. Would have returned it, but missed the return window."
1.0,No Sweatpants in any way! Nylon not cotton! Sizing way off! Complete disappointment
1.0,Terrible quality! Can't even return now since 30 days has passed. What kind of guarantee is that!!  Wore ONE TIME.  WHAT A RIP OFF
1.0,"They r not what I expected, I was really looking forward to using them, so disappointed they are flimsy and loose,  they look polarized but my eyes felt other wise."
1.0,Not true to size. Cheap zipper
1.0,I plugged this in and NOTHING.  Looked nice but did not work at all.  I did try many times but still nothing.
1.0,TOO SMALL... Large is for 10 year old girl. so guys buy 3X large . good luck
1.0,Falls off your head. No grip to stay on at all. Never wear them.
1.0,This is not made for adults. An EX LARGE is super small. Definitely smells like fish. Absolutely disgusting! Wouldn't recommend and will be returning.
1.0,Battery out 2nd one needs special  tools  to put in watch. Amazon has good return policy.
1.0,"Después de dos días de usarlos en un collar cambio su color totalmente, tanto en plateados como en dorados, tendré que reinvertir para mis productos, dinero perdido"
1.0,I returned these they are huge not the fashion statement I want to make.
1.0,"Fits like a shirt, not a dress! I should have returned it!"
1.0,Shirt runs really small. Poor quality. Guess that's what you get when made in China. Not showing much American pride after I made this mistake.
1.0,Nunca me los enviaron !!! Los pedi en invierno y ya estamos en primavera casi verano y nunca llegaron siguen diciendo en camino.
1.0,"Love the top but unfortunately the wrong size I ordered medium for all four tops, and this one is an XL<br />Way too big.<br />Too expensive to post it back, but it as the one I liked the best.<br />The other three are really nice and I a. Looking forward to wearing them.<br />Cheers<br />Jennifer Brass"
1.0,Didn’t receive the pants just the jacket.
1.0,When I got this hat out of the bag that it came it is had a brown / darkish stain on he bill. Which is very noticable. I 10/10 would not order from this company / manufacturer.
1.0,One of these earrings broke before I could get it in my ear. They are beautiful but the quality is very poor.
1.0,I am beginning to think I received a knock off. I am totally disappointed in the quality of this item. I've only worn it twice and the thread around the arm sleeves is coming out. For the money spent on this item it shouldn't fall apart after only two uses.
1.0,The outside temperature was 0 and within thirty minutes my feet ( toes ) were very cold. I also had another pair of thick cotton socks and felt.lined boots on. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
1.0,Cheap knock offs
1.0,Way to big for my 7 month old i suggest your get a size or two smaller.
1.0,"Very flimsy and sort of like a parachute. Its weird all the way around. I don't care for it in person, but to each it's own."
1.0,"Band is super cute, but it is not the right size for my watch even though I ordered the correct size. Will be returning."
1.0,"Edit: The only time I wore this, the leather cord separated from the clasp, so it is irreparable. Returning for refund.<br />The charm itself is cute but the rest of this necklace is garbage. There is no o-ring on the charm, it hangs on a flimsy piece of metal that joins together where the charm sits. Easily comes apart."
1.0,The dress material was so cheap it looks like my kids Halloween costumes. Very disappointing
1.0,It was way too small. Color was great but I couldn’t use it and had to return it.
1.0,"I usually don't have a issue with buying clothes on amazon.. But this shirt fit perfectly around mid section, flowy but chest area way too tight. C cup. This shirt has no stretch to it either."
1.0,Doesn't hold in place and the pins break in the first hour of wear. The were sold as a discounted item. I know why!
1.0,worst hat i ever bought way to small and this is after reading about them being oversized. i bought my regular size and its way ti small. also the return postage would be half the price of the hat. didnt send it back ill wear it in the pool but what a total letdown
1.0,"I wish I could get a refund! This fit small.  Pulled everywhere after 1 wear. Decal pulling off. Seams are so big and rough, gave ny son terrible rash.  Way too expensive."
1.0,"The color was very off, was very flimsy did not work for me"
1.0,Wore the item 5 times. A total of 40 hours. &#34;Bling&#34; is coming off. Poorly made. Very disappointed because I love the belt.
1.0,Way too small to fit over your foot... No stretch to it.  It's now a bracelet
1.0,"The product is incredibly poorly made and not at all as represented in the pictures. Not scrub quality, would not wear it in any situation. The print is blurry. The material is very light weight pajama type material."
1.0,"The description says 100%, they where 80% polyester and 20% cotton. So I sent them back!"
1.0,"I thought the bracelet was very pretty, but it definitely didn't seem worth the high price tag in comparison to some of the similar knockoffs. I've purchased 3 real Swarovski Stardust bracelets and two knockoffs, all in similar colors. By far the knock off didn't look as nice, but their clasp was way more secure than the Swarovski's clasps were. I'm very shocked that the magnetic clasp on the real item would be so weak that it would cause the bracelet to fall off multiple times while wearing it around the house. I never ended up wearing the real Swarovski bracelets outside of my house because I was afraid I would lose them. I wore the knockoffs multiple times to work and as I went out and about on my day and have never had any problems with them at all. I would rather have it look like a knock off and be secure and cheaper than to be the real thing and I lose it immediately after purchasing.<br /><br />I mentioned this in my other reviews of the Swarovski Stardust bracelets I purchased at the same time, but want to note it here for those who aren't reviewing my other reviews. The low rating is wholeheartedly based on the defective clasp and not the beauty of the bracelet. This is a stunning bracelet, but for the price its not worth the insecurity I would feel wearing it."
1.0,Would give 0 stars if possible. Bought this for my niece and would never give such a hunk of junk as a gift. It was advertised as Sterling silver and nowhere on the package or item say's 925. Very disappointed. I ordered a beautiful silver necklace and received costume jewelry. I've already started the return process
1.0,Clingy not a nice flow at all like the photo looks - it is a strange cut and it does not drop over the hips like the photo suggests - the fabric is not nice and I returned this item without a second thought.  Not a good look - I ordered a small and it hung strangely - I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 120 and it was still a misfit in every way.
1.0,"Seriously, the fabric was so thin you could probably read the printed label on your underwear.  Too bad 'cause they are SO cute!"
1.0,"At first I loved this jacket until I realized that everywhere I went there were feathers. The feathers wound up on EVERYTHING! In my car, my house, my office. If I wore dark colored clothing the feathers would be left on me. I finally got rid of the coat because I got tired of having to use a lint roller every time I wore it. Not worth the annoyance."
1.0,"Waste, they look great on the screen, no so much in person"
1.0,These are literally just painted. I wore It for 2 days before it looked like this and my piercing that I’ve had for 12 years is irritated. Poor quality! They’re also much larger than they say.
1.0,The fit is too large and after one wash the strap literally fell apart
1.0,Too long. I am 5'3 and I found it looked awkward on me.
1.0,save your change.
1.0,Horrible QA - 3 of the 25 sliders were not even sliders!!  see pic. If I didn’t absolutely need the other 22 sliders so badly for an upcoming event - I would have returned them entirely.  Beware.
1.0,Chain broke within 16 hours of receiving it as a gift! This was all he wanted. In the process of returning the necklace now.
1.0,"They run small and the material is nylon not good to me for sweatpants, I rather have cotton"
1.0,Was too big and couldn’t be flipped up like it’s supposed to be.
1.0,Unfortunately I had to return the pink leggings because they were completely see through. I could see my underwear through the from and the back. Otherwise they were super cute and comfy! Very sad about this because the color is gorgeous...I guess I’ll just have to try the black ones instead. I’m 5’1” 145 and I bought a medium and they fit great.
1.0,Tooo big
1.0,If you wear a large you should order an Extra large
1.0,Too large and awkward.
1.0,The size is wwwwaaayyyyy smaller
1.0,Took forever to get and then the size was way to small.  Would t get again
1.0,Much shorter than pictured. The burgundy color is fire engine red and hideous. Not recommended at all. Product not as described.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:a005508b23fb508ad4dccb3c27c29fcd]] This is a child crop top. Picture is very deseaving. Not an adult full size shirt
1.0,When I purchased this bracelet it didn’t state the size of it and it did not (and still doesn’t) say that it’s silver plated.
1.0,Says adult but not large it’s a child size opening for head and arms save your money and buy from The Mountain then you get the correct size and quality
1.0,Very thin! And not at vibrant as the picture
1.0,"i had high hopes for these compression socks: large enough calves to fit mine, yet still tight around the ankles, and toe boxes that don't threaten hammertoe.  Unfortunately, after one afternoon's wearing, I ended up with a rash on both legs, from ankles to knees, that featured red skin and small bumps that itched like crazy for over a week.  I've worn Copperfit medical socks before with no problems other than too-tight calves.  The price and fit were okay, but the discomfort was horrible.  Returning."
1.0,I gave the mask a initial wash after receiving them and the seam in front of the mask on two came apart. It like as if they were held together with glue. The rest of them have small gap in the seam when I try to tug in it. You will not get protection wearing these.
1.0,"My daughter does swim classes four times a month and She’s only worn it for two months, now and the color is fading already like if it’s ripping alway not great quality for it being Nike. The size fit well But that’s it I wouldn’t buy this product again poor fabric."

1.0,"This was in the listing as being 6.25"" x 3"" -  actual size I received 7.5' x 3.5"" To Tall to  fit shirt pocket.  Very disappointed in the lack of seller not putting in the correct size of the glass case."
1.0,Be careful with this product! You may have to order 2 or more sizes up for a good fit.
1.0,Cheaply made and the sizing is off.
1.0,The cactus-heart was like a photo copy in plastic. This was the cheapest looking tee shirt I’ve ever seen.  I wouldn’t pay .50 cents for this at a garage sale!
1.0,I followed the sizing recommendation and this suit was extremely small and unwearable.
1.0,Piece of crap! Didn't last four hours into the day and chain just broke! Didn't bang into anything just fell apart

1.0,order next size up...
1.0,Watches band disconnects itself from the watch face all the time. It just falls off your wrist!! Not surr if they're all like that or if I just got a bad one.
1.0,Not impressed with the quality of this product. I’ve used purse hooks for years. This is the first time I have ever had the metal snap on me. I use the hook work for my tiny cross body purse-only fits my case wallet & ecig. After 1 week of use the metal snapped.
1.0,"Sizes are not accurate at all and run  too small , So ordered a second one two sizes up while a i returned the first order had to send that second one back and just gave up . I would pass on this one and the second one arrived with a white stain. Very disappointed."
1.0,Color much darker than photos.
1.0,Product does not fit as advertised for this model of M Frame Oakleys. The tab on clip is not even big enough to secure lens to frame and the shape of the clip does not conform to the frame shape. Look elsewhere for a replacement clip.
1.0,It’s see thru
1.0,Size was way off
1.0,Horrible quality. I’ve worn these for two nights and already the seams are coming undone in a major way... the only reason it even gets a star is because amazon makes you put at least one.
1.0,Would not be warm for winter time they are very very very thin
1.0,Came completely apart in less than a month. Very poor quality.
1.0,"Nope. These just slowly loosen up and ai ended up sagging. They seem to work great at the beginning, but two hours in, they were like a slug....just Oozed on down... it was sad. I had high hopes. (Pun intended). I am a 36DD. Waste of my money."
1.0,Hat was small . The bow was like adult size but might be even big for me .I ordered for my 9 month old . The pants are baggy and the onsie was so badly made .The caller part is so wide and basically falls off her shoulders.
1.0,This hat is much too large for me.
1.0,All sequins fell off from the day I got the dress very sad I bought for my daughter now she cannot wear it very horrible material.  .
1.0,"Complete junk. When I received it I thought it was great, however the safety clasp in the back has already broken and does not work. Also the finish is coming off the metal and it looks like crap. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone and I wish I would not have wasted the money"
1.0,Stopped working as soon as we opened it. :(
1.0,Item way too small!  It was not even close to a 2XL!
1.0,"The mitten part is already coming off, and there's a huge hole in the the thumb. I've had these for less than a month. Bad product. Do not buy."
1.0,The concept does not work well for me.
1.0,"In short, it doesn’t match. So kind of useless."
1.0,"Not even as close to the size you order. Let's just say if your kid wears a 6, then order an eight 🤷🏾‍♀️"
1.0,"I really was excited when I received this bag really love the pattern, bright colors and all the pockets. Unfortunately after a few months the zippers are no longer working and the bag is now useless. Very disappointing"

1.0,"Is not what I expected, the picture looks nice but when I receive it  doesn't look what in the picture from the add!!!! Try to return or get the refund but I'm having  so much trouble so I just don't bother anymore.!!!"
1.0,"The pictures made this dress seem much different. I felt like I was wearing a floofy old potato sack. If I kept the sleeves pulled up over my shoulders, I looked like I was a woman in medieval times. If I put the sleeves down, then the back would slouch and show my strapless bra. No matter how I tried to wear this, it did not look good. This made it's way to the Goodwill box immediately after trying on."
1.0,"This is my second time purchasing this case because it's functional and really cute HOWEVER it breaks very easily. Each case lasted a max of three weeks before the bracelet fell off and was irreparable. I wish I could return them both but the window has expired. Great idea, executed poorly."
1.0,These bands broke after about the 5th day of wearing them. They pull apart from the inside of the band and detach from the base of the fitbit. I do not recommend.
1.0,Sz small was still too big for my hands and they did not keep my hands warm at all.
1.0,Buyer Beware! Do not buy this product!<br />The mouse on both charms is smushed looks like it's shrink-wrapped to fit the tiny bead I bought it for my sister-in-law cuz she collects Pandora and this product said it fits the Pandora bracelet but it looks horrendous I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy if I didn't know it was Minnie Mouse I will just think it's a white blob with color behind it. No good
1.0,"Too small. Bought for my sister, but she couldn't wear it."
1.0,"The slit is literally in the middle and comes up SUPER high... if you dont want to show your private parts, dont buy!"
1.0,I ordered black pants and pictures shows solid black but the item us more black and grey stripes pattern. Will be returning.
1.0,This purse lasted me about a month amd a half before the buckle that clip to my purse broke. And there really not enough room.
1.0,"The stone is extremely dark in color, unlike what you'd expect a sapphire to look like. And it is also full of imperfections. Looks murky and has spots just under the surface."
1.0,I bought this pair of short and 2 others.  This one was made of cheap material and the crotch ripped while I was wearing it.  The other short worked out fine.
1.0,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE - THE PRODUCT FEELS CHEAP AND THE COLOR IS WAY OFF THAN WHAT WAS SHOWN ON THE SCREEN. THEY REFUSE TO GIVE A REFUND AND THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO WORK WITH ME.
1.0,Not at all the quality I expected
1.0,"The material is soooooo thin! I bought this in both black and blue. One was HUGE the other SMALL. The arms are very snug, baggy in the stomach area (it's cut like it balloons out in the abdominal region in a not so flattering way), and an odd length. I'm 5'6&#34;. One came down to mid calf the other to my feet."
1.0,There is 2 stones that already fell out of of this bead is there anyway I can return for a refund or swap for a different one?
1.0,Terrible quality but cool shirt. Lettering started coming offf on second wash. Horrendous.
1.0,Cute sweater but runs too small.
1.0,The clasp broke before I even put it on.  You get what you pay for!
1.0,"Did not like material, looks like plastic"
1.0,Ridiculously uncomfortable
1.0,Not what the picture portays. Do not buy.
1.0,I order this skirt its nothing like the pic it looks like a sweater that you tied around your waist. I was very disappointed. returning it
1.0,"This charm is t. i. n. y. And I mean TINY, PUNEY🤬<br />I bought this charm to add to a charm bracelet that was given to me by my Aunt, to give to my cousin who just graduated from medical school. Said Aunt was her Grandmother. It just looks RIDICULOUS next to the other charms that I have PRECIOUSLY collected through the past 45 years. It was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to find a Caduceus symbol, plenty of nursing charms, but the Caduceus, almost nil. Apparently the company’s that carry the charms believe that WOMEN are only nurses. AND, this has NOTHING to do with nurses. AT ALL!!<br />All’s I am saying is that I just wanted a NICE charm for her. This charm is NOT THAT."
1.0,your large and 2 X are deceiving. Sizes are not American.
1.0,Cheap material. You surely get what I pay for...
1.0,Sized extremely small. Nice quality shirt. It is a shame I can't wear it again.
1.0,These bracelets lasted a few days at most. They wouldn’t wrap around the wrist and lost shape
1.0,The watch did not work. I need to return it.
1.0,Really irriated my daughters ears. We bought these because she has sensitive ears and can only use surgical steel/piercing studs or gold and silver. These say they are steel but her ears were hot and red and swollen overnight.
1.0,"I wouldn’t buy this again.<br /><br />I was in a uniform position for my job.  The pants had to be tailored to you, no belt loops on them.  I bought this in hopes it would be an option for weight fluctuations.  It didn’t really work for me."
1.0,Made for a doll and I don't mean a grown up woman. Awful. Do not purchase. They will not allow a return and you're stuck with doll clothes.
1.0,"Broke within 2 days, not worth returning"
1.0,I have always had a seamless return with Amazon. The product was listed as having free returns. The seller insisted on charging for the return. The material of this shirt was not of good quality and it didn’t fit well.
1.0,"The dress was way too small, I bought a XXL and it fits like a medium size.. Im very disappointed..."
1.0,What can you say about a product you cannot use?
1.0,Does not have suitable way to attach the band to the Fitbit. The wrapped elastic is looped and sewn with the fabric around it. Then you put the connector spike through that loop to attach to the face.<br />There is not enough room for all of that elastic and fabric inside the connection area.
1.0,I specifically looked har for big heads and this one was not big I couldnt wear this
1.0,Sent back immediately
1.0,It does not help hold your body heat like others I've bought. It is soft but does run bigger than normal.
1.0,I did not get this watch in the box just the other 2
1.0,These look nothing like the pictures. Very disappointed. I would give them 0 stars if I could.
1.0,"Im disgusted with the condition of this jacket. It’s not just a missing button and a stain, it’s all around. The pictures show all."
1.0,Too small.  Returned them to sender.
1.0,"Not worth the time and effort. Get the stirrup type shirt stays instead. This was uncomfortable, and a pain in the ass to get on."
1.0,They are way too big.
1.0,Poor quality. Wore twice and the &quot;sterling silver&quot; was a brassy copper.  Extremely disappointed.
1.0,it smells terrible
1.0,Did not fit my moto smart watch
1.0,This is terrible force advertising looks  nothing like in the picture the xlarge is so small this doesnt deserve no star.
1.0,Poor quality  you can see through material
1.0,"Altho labeled as xl, extra large, median compression, they were too tight to go over my foot ........unusable."
1.0,Came with ripped seams/not completely sewn
1.0,Not great quality. Feels cheap. The pleats are not pleated all the way to the end of the skirt. Also material doesn’t breath so it not summer.
1.0,"The belt itself is fine, but the color was nothing like it should have been. I ordered the real green, and I got a bright turquoise blue color, which was nowhere close to what the picture showed."
1.0,Too small. Sent back.
1.0,"Broke within 2 months.  Save your money, don't bother."
1.0,"Talla S 120 libras Muy linda, pero no acolchada y se nota el bras,tela transparente 👀 Y pequeña la parte del busto, pueden escoger una talla más grande"
1.0,"This dress is cute, but just is super awkward feeling in the fit. I’n 5’7 1/2 & 120lbs. Too short. Not worth it unless you are petite with short stems."
1.0,Was supposed to be purple but was blue
1.0,"Super cheap material, looks like a Halloween costume dress. Very unhappy"
1.0,Supposed to get 5 and only got 1
1.0,I wear 3x not even 5x would fit
1.0,Not at all the same color nor cut as the photo.
1.0,BBig and bleeds
1.0,ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED IN THE PICTURE APPEARS TO BE GEMSTONE-RHINESTONE
1.0,They were all smushed upon arrival.
1.0,I don’t know anybody that this would actually fit. I have average sized ears and this just doesn’t work. Requesting a refund.
1.0,Nothing like the first picture 🤦🏾‍♂️
1.0,Doesn’t look a damn thing like the photo. What a waste of money. It’s pretty much white with some color dots spread on it. It’s soft that’s what gets it one star. So mad.
1.0,"I was planning to wear this on a trip to Vegas. I loved the idea of this suit but as I tried it on, moved and the top and bottom broke. First the chain on the right side of the bottoms broke, as I was trying to fix it the top broke. The top broke in the middle between the cups.<br />I’m glad I tried this bikini on before wearing it because I would have been completely exposed.<br />I understand for a cheaper bikini you get what you pay for, but I would of appreciated to actually be able to wear it first before it falling apart, literally."
1.0,Leg zipper broke just after a month of wearing. Worn only twice during that month though. Too late to return. Not a good buy.
1.0,"This is basically the same material as a dri-fit t-shirt. The dress fit me well, but the outline of the pockets was so obvious. The gray is lighter than pictured and not flattering. There is no way anything could have been put in the pockets without looking lumpy and ridiculous. I returned it and got a refund, but didn't have to send it back."
1.0,Same mask found at Staples in a 3 pack for less than price paid. Buyer beware.
1.0,"not well made, fit was poor and short!"
1.0,The package was horrible as well the jewellery looked so old and cheap quality. the product is not worth even 2$ made out of cheap quality..please dont buy...
1.0,Broke the moment I tried to put it on.  Took a long time to arrive.  Not worth the wait or the money.
1.0,The colour runs
1.0,Unfortunately came damaged ((
1.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding I have coming up. I looked at all the reviews and pictures and was super excited about this dress. Unfortunately, when I tried it on it would not fit AT ALL. I got the largest size available which is also the size I generally wear in dresses. This dress must run smaller than usual, because it did not fit. Also, the top part of the dress looks like it could rip apart if I move the wrong way. I have returned it."
1.0,"Really... I so loved my ring when I received it everyone gave me compliments about the ring.<br />It shines like crazy, the size of the stone is just right, and the color of the finish was beautiful.<br />After one week I notice my rose gold changing to a yellow gold Epic Fail WHYYYYY!!!<br />I love the ring so much but the fading is not a good look. Now I don't know what to do with my once lovely now faded ring. :("
1.0,Doesn’t sit nicely. Bigger than expected.
1.0,"To small, cheap material..it has no stretch to the material."
1.0,Have to order 2sizes up
1.0,"I thou this was a embroidered logo hat, it's not, it's a cheap iron on like screen print."
1.0,"I liked this watch when I first bought it  but later i realized that you get what you pay for. the watch stopped working 3 months after I bought, and before that the watch was not staying on my wrist. i wouldn't recommend this watch."
1.0,"I purchased these for my babies. After a couple of months of wear, they tarnished. Tried cleaning them with natural cleansers (e.g., baking soda, vinegar). It didn't work.<br /><br />These earrings are simply silver-plated. I have to buy two new pairs of earrings for my girls. I do not recommend!"
1.0,Terrible product. Not finished on the edges. Literally just cut and sewn together with no care<br /> Uneven stitching and terrible quality
1.0,Poor quality also
1.0,Horrible- moldy substance or oily marks on the case interior which is a velveteen material so couldn't just clean it. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,Too big and floppy had to send them back
1.0,its not seamless<br />its unconfortable
1.0,Itchy polyester and looks cheap.
1.0,Not very durable.. I guess you get what you pay for. Some chip marks on the gray side and black is showing underneath. Also a dent/rough groove on the belt buckle? Not sure if maybe my particular item was defective or if they all come with cosmetic flaws.
1.0,"Looked amazing until one day they just falled down my face, don't know if this was a bad pair or what buy they just broke like nothing so buyer beware."
1.0,Not attractive at all
1.0,"This broke in the first 5 minutes of use, I squeezed the bulbs gently and then after a few times, I heard a pop on the right side. Unfortunately, it’s 1 day after the return window closed."
1.0,Kid glasses
1.0,This shirt is very very thin and one can see though the material...cheaply made...my lesson...you get what you pay for
1.0,"This is my only one star review ever on amazon. Im usually very happy but this was nothing like expected. First its a cheap polyster, very thin doll clothing type. In addition to the horrible fabric the neck is very ill fitting. nd the arm pit area comes down incredibly far. Even my strapless bra couldnt be worn unless I wanted it sround my waist. Its unfortunate as the top looked good in pictures."
1.0,It broke the day I put it on .
1.0,Needs to have a liner. You could see through the entire dress. Sent back immediately.
1.0,The earrings are plastic that looks like this. I put them in a donation pile to go some place that can sell them or give them away.
1.0,Awkward fit. I returned
1.0,Fit well and seemed to be well made. But is NOT wrinkle free..in fact there's creases from packing that don't go away. Care was supposed to be machine wash..tag says hand wash or dry clean and line dry in shade no less. Material content was supposed to be 60% cotton..tag says 2% cotton and 98% some other material I've never heard of...it said on the tag but I've already returned the shirt. There was also a strip of discoloration on the back of the shirt. Wouldn't buy from this company again.
1.0,This thing is cheap quality and runs small.
1.0,"This hat, while stylish is very thin.  It is SPF but the sun passes right through it, and there is little protection for the eyes, even with sunglasses.  The brim needs to be double in material for extra sun protection.  I live in Florida and need more substantial covering from the sun's rays.  I had to return it."
1.0,Did not even have this a week and my wrist started turning brown.  Took it off put my original back on.  Sorry will not purchase again and I do not recommend.
1.0,"Terrible quality, hard plastic bent out of shape. Save your money."
1.0,Wasn’t even small
1.0,it looks very cheap and kitch
1.0,"I've ordered many, many of these jeans.  All were perfect, love, love, love them.....BUT, this particular order is way off the sizing.  They are almost 2 sizes too small.<br /><br />Not happy about that.  I have always ordered the same size and absolutely love these jeans.  I'll be leary going forward."
1.0,I regret buying this. It looks very cheap. The photos fooled me.
1.0,I'm in my 60's so this was not very flattering!
1.0,Dislike: It shrank and does not even fit a 2 year old child. I got 5T Bad experience. It was not even used because we usually wash new clothes before wearing them. I lost money in this stuff!  It does not even deserve  STAR ⭐️
1.0,Product is a bit short in length for 2xl. I wouldn’t order this product again based on that. Nice colors but feels cheap material. Not sure if this others reviews are paid for. I’m 6’4 so if you’re around this height I don’t not recommend.
1.0,Terrible quality. Falls right off
1.0,"Once you attach to the wrist, the buckle doesn’t stay on the wrist. It comes right off so it’s pointless."
1.0,I need the rest
1.0,Didn't care for them and too pricey!
1.0,The watchband fell apart before I even got it on my wrist the first time. The 'leather' was scraped and showed white spots. Very disappointed.
1.0,Hole could be smaller for the pole. Using it on top of an umbrella stand to hold it in the wind. Do not know how long it will last as it leaks at the drain so refilling will be required after only two- three days! Rather pricey for the lack of quality that will not hold water. Added hose tape to try and slow down the leaking.<br />For the price would not recommend this product.
1.0,DO NOT buy this. It turned black on my mom after wearing it for a couple of months.
1.0,These made absolutely zero difference to night driving glare. None.<br />Don't waste your money on these.
1.0,"Broke the first day I wore it, but hey I mean I guess you get what you pay for! Hope you have better luck :)"
1.0,My package arrived with no bib.
1.0,My fault! I read the reviews about the horrible hinging. Upon the second day of use they failed! Just as reviewed! If the hinge worked I would really love them! Exactly what I was looking for
1.0,Ohhhh no......
1.0,Flimsy and impossible to iron some creases and wrinkles out of. No where on the inside to attach bobby pins.
1.0,Is a knock off. Couldn't send back.
1.0,"I loved the actual look of this item, but I am a thick girl and this item run very small. I wasn't able to wear myself, but passed it on to my daughter who loves it!"
1.0,Looks beautiful .....when I opened it is was devistated. All plastic!! You can barely  even see the design. It's definately somthing you'd expect from a gumball machine. Very very disappointed.  I would give no stars if I could.
1.0,"This shirt doesn't know what it is. I thought it would be a sexy night out type, but it's a fleecey material, more like a heavy t shirt. It's definitely not silver but a dull grey. Too boring to wear out on the town, too sexy to just wear anyplace."
1.0,Item is not as described!  these would be a compression sock on a 5 year old not a grown adult
1.0,These are child- not women's sizes.<br />Unfortunately a waste of my money
1.0,Did not like the material or how it fit
1.0,trash
1.0,Just a somewhat fitting shirt.  Almost no strength to the stretch.  Definitely not &#34;compression.&#34;
1.0,"Cute, but doesn't keep time. The minute hand moves around if the watch is not kept still. Not useful to carry around in your pocket."
1.0,not the quality i expected
1.0,"Thought 2 would come, Nope only 1 and they are super flimsy. You will break it into if you bend it"
1.0,"Received dress unbuttoned, stuffed into a bag and with a broken zipper."
1.0,"Let me start by saying, my daughter has participated in pageants for the last 5 years and I have ALWAYS purchased her formals from Amazon. But this is the first time I've gotten burned.<br /><br />This dress is the worse knock off I've ever seen. The patern of the accents on the bodice arent even the same as what is pictured. The sequins on the tulle of the skirt are GLUED on, and not well either. There were multiple stains on the dress, one on the inside of the bodice from god-knows-what, and tons of stains from access glue from the accents being poorly placed. The modesty panel in the corset back is HUGE, and sticks out the armpit, and cant be folded because there is boning or something in the top to keep it stiff. The seam on the back is poorly stitched and an absolute eye sore. And the dress didnt reach the floor on my average height child.<br /><br />We are very cost conscious when it comes to pageants (they add up quick!), and this the most I've ever spent on one of her dresses, because she loved it so much. And it's the only one I've ever gotten that couldn't be adjusted or altered in some way to work. Its a hopless mess. Thank goodness I ordered early enough to return and find something different."
1.0,The shirt is super cute the shorts are ugly and a very bad material not comfortable at all
1.0,Ood fit and weird material. Wish I could return but window to return passed.
1.0,"Not that great of a buy, thin plastic and seemed oversized .. I returned them"
1.0,"Totally misleading, I ordered it to glow in the pink like the photo, but when I got it, it glows the faintest of green, doesn't even hold its glow for more then 3 seconds"
1.0,while the band looks great using it is not very functional. it’s difficult to get the metal nub into the hole to fasten band onto wrist.
1.0,The neck on this was huge! Too oversized and schlumpy for me to keep.
1.0,"I thought this was going to be a cotton hat but material is a thick polyester type of material instead. Additionally, hat is SO LARGE that it keeps sliding off. I purchased bc this pack of 2 ($18.99 for 2) seemed significantly more affordable than the single hats on amazon for $15.99, but it is clear why it was cheaper. The quality just doesn't compare to the other cotton scub hats I purchased through amazon. be aware"
1.0,the colors didn't match my personality
1.0,I ordered a dream catcher belly button ring and it came in as a skull hand and wasn’t even a belly button ring it was like a tongue ring or something. Defiantly was not happy with it I threw it away.
1.0,"Soft?  If you consider cardboard soft.  If you enjoy wrapping yourself in tree bark.  If you like the sensation of a 10 year-old starched hard towel scratching against your body.<br /><br />Otherwise, uh, nope!"
1.0,Slides off the table.  Too difficult to use because of having to screw the loop together.
1.0,"This dress was see-through, sadly."
1.0,The jewelry is pretty but had allergic reaction by the morning :(
1.0,This item was sewn incorrectly and was very noticeable on both items I received. The had to unpick and re-sew it due to time constraints.
1.0,This product turned out to be very un secure my phone fell two times the attachment does not work well contacted company and they never even answered me
1.0,"Admit have had this charm for a while, but noticed last month that the red paint fell off. Now I have a green and white Italian flag."
1.0,I didn’t like the material at all.
1.0,Its way to small for the size. The grown woman on the picture that picture aint true... screw this..
1.0,These are not compression shirts. More like a silky tang top.
1.0,We loved the watch so much but after 6 months the watch died... new batteries don’t even make it work. I’m so disappointed bc this was a Christmas gift that I thought would last a long time...
1.0,"I have an Inspire 3 and no matter which band I try with the little pins put into place, they won't click in. I bought other bands that worked just fine. I'm returning these."
1.0,I like the style but too short. Its not the same as the pic
1.0,They are so small. You can buy the earrings at your local beauty supply. Not even worth the money to ship it back for a return.
1.0,"These are not what I expected! The back of the pantie is very low, the front comes up too high. The cotton is thin and &#34;scratchy&#34;, ugly colors, the elastic has no stretch, it's just sewn in.  Overpriced on top of it! I'm done with Hanes, they used to have great quality but not any more; in many of the items I have purchased recently. Woman's sweat shirts, sweat pants and another style of under panties, also, men's sweatshirts; all a waste of money :-("
1.0,Totally off sizing
1.0,Wa ok not what I expected
1.0,Very short. If you have anything above a c cup this is very short.
1.0,"The straps broke as soon as I put the wings on.  I was able to tie them & they made it through 3 of my 6 Halloween parties - but then I had to find a new costume last minute.  I would suggest these only for extremely petit (small & thin) girls, no older than 16."
1.0,AMAZON SENT VENDOR A REFUND ASKING TO REFUND IN FULL.  ITEM WAS RETURNED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED (TRUE TO SIZE / SIZE WAY OFF).  MATERIAL THIN QUALITY.  THE BRA WASN'T AN EXTRA LARGE!!!!!!<br /><br />WARNING!!!  IF YOU AREN'T SURE YOU WILL 100% LIKE VENDOR PRODUCT DO NO BUY.  YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE A PARTIAL REFUND EVENT IF THE ITEM YOU RECEIVE IS NOT AS ADVERTISED.
1.0,"The glasses are way too big, do not stay on! Great for someone with a big head!"
1.0,"These dresses are nice but they are not stitch properly, they want you to pay so much money for there items and not even so all properly stitch them it’s a disgrace."
1.0,The chain is bigger then the strawberry and it was faded
1.0,These arrived and it looked like they had been worn and not even in packaging. One of the collar tags was so tattered it seems is years old.
1.0,The complete look of the dress is like a undefined box nothing like the picture
1.0,dont buy it
1.0,I like the magnetic aspect of the band but it catches on the sleeves of my clothes and snags them.
1.0,It is  way to tight on the wrist.
1.0,"Was very short , way shorter than it looked in photos"
1.0,Ordered a large for my Daughter and it is tiny! More cropped than I thought it would be too. There is no tag inside for me to know if I got the right size.
1.0,Totally not rip proof. Ripped while my husband tried to put it on.  Very disappointing
1.0,Not good for plus size girls.
1.0,Need a larger size than I ordered. If ordering I say order two size a bigger if you want it to fit like in picture. I ordered larger size and still too small. And it advertises flannel but it is not flannel.
1.0,The back posts are not gold. Ears started itching within minutes
1.0,Loved the appearance but unfortunately one sleeve was very defective.
1.0,These gloves barely gets warm
1.0,To small for the size we purchased<br />Returned product
1.0,Don't waste your time buying clothes on Amazon.<br />Falsely advertised<br />And sizes are irregular
1.0,Muy delgada y corriente no me gusto
1.0,Ordered an XL since I have big breasts and it was waaaay too small. XL is my usual size
1.0,This is a piece of garbage. The provided screwdriver stripped installing the trash on my surge so I have to buy something else to return it. The provided screws were smaller than the holes on the band so the band just fell off. On top of it I ruined my surge in order to install it so now I'm out another $100+ dollars.
1.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and 170 lbs the XL in this dress was not even CLOSE to being able to zip up on me.  I have no idea what kind of non rib cage, flat chested woman this is suppose to fit, but It was completely unable to come close to zipping up."
1.0,Don't bother with this. I impulse bought this and didn't read the reviews. The next morning I tried to cancel the order and I couldn't. The shirt is a weird shape and length. It doesn't flatter your body and its not very long either. Its also itchy as hell and the decal is cheap and stiff. The package smelt funny when it arrived. I've washed it twice now and its still scratchy and stiff. Waste of money.
1.0,"the crotch is EXTREMELY small. No room for the boys at all, everything gets crushed :p"
1.0,"not only it was too small when I exchanged they send me the same kind without the straps I never open the plastic until when I was going to use it and the bigger size fitted perfect as I expected but they send me the wrong model and Im unable to exchange, Im  very upset If I knew that was one with straps and one without I would have opened and tried it immediately since this was for a later occasion and I knew how it would fit from trying the smaller one I packed on my bag for my trip got there only to realize there was no straps which never works for me so this is going to the donation pile."
1.0,The watch came lose after the first time wearing it.
1.0,"I used it for halloween, had to repair the clasp was broken. Had a problem with the site."
1.0,The earrings look all silver. They do not look like sunflowers because there is no yellow color in the middle. Very disappointed because the middle is white.
1.0,cheap material....its tooo small....and I ordered blue but they delivered black one....dissapointed...
1.0,These mask are huge and offer no protection
1.0,"thin, flimsy, like a groceries bag,straps cutting to my shoulders ,not for any weight"
1.0,No son del mismo tamaño del frame.
1.0,"The fabric feels like plastic, no cotton at all!  I just found out 'no free return'. I don't even bother to send it back to China to waste more money on shipping. Lesson learned!!"
1.0,Not useful waste of money
1.0,Product was nice looking. After several days my keys fell off because the key ring just broke.
1.0,The legs fall off iron man easily.  The figurines are painted very cheaply. I am not amazed this item is no longer offered.
1.0,There was no elastic  band in this swimsuit. Very disappointed.
1.0,I thought it’ll look exactly like the picture it didn’t
1.0,I love love love the frames but when I  went to get Rx lenses put in they don't have anywhere to unscrew to put them in.
1.0,See through. It’s thin material and absolutely see through on the rear end.
1.0,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! Broke the second day I wore it.  Was nearly impossible to program in the first place and by the second day of wearing it the clasp mechanism was broken as was one of the side buttons used to change the screen display.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS WATCH!
1.0,Cheaply made.. Collar uneven... I have several of these dresses in different colors that I've ordered from other sellers and they were made way better
1.0,The tool broke while adjusting just the first link of the watch. This means I'm unable to adjust the band length to fit my wrist making the watch useless. Waste of money. Don't buy.
1.0,"I love sweatshirt dresses, this is not a sweatshirt dress, tunic or blouse. It is made from the thinnest material, almost see thru.  If you're going to describe it as such at least use sweatshirt material."
1.0,It won't fold up all of the way.
1.0,This necklace was poor quality and I ended up giving it away.  I guess you get what you pay for. Skip this one folks.
1.0,"It is very see through (as shown in the ad's for the product). I was ok with that, however, it was very large, had 2 holes in it and felt like it had been stretched or worn before. I returned it."
1.0,"These are sized for kids...I ended up giving to my 8-year old daughter.  Do not buy, if you are an average US size 8... :("
1.0,Too small I hate it
1.0,Can not adjusted  it
1.0,"like the femine look; BUT, the band has two loops to secure the part of the band with holes.  The first loop is (1) way too close to the fastener and (2) too tight to allow the part of the band with holes to go thru it.  Sure, I could cut off that loop, but when something else breaks (which I expect) it will be my fault."
1.0,Broke the next day
1.0,The arm broke within hours of wearing them - you get what you pay for.
1.0,It came dirty with a white piece of paper that had been wet at some point with blots of ink. The ink transferred into the shirt and there were signs of mold.
1.0,"Gold didn't match my watch, it was a different shade"
1.0,"Received used dirty item with staines on front, and smelled like a ton of perfume. The color also doesn't match the picture. It's a much brighter yellow."
1.0,It was soo cute with a belt...kinda like Amy wine house dress but after 1 wash it shrunk and is now too short to wear again
1.0,Looks like cheap $1 store jewelry
1.0,Cheap thin plastic. Like wearing a large garbage bag. Not worth anywhere near $60.00.
1.0,I ordered an extra large to make sure I could wear them. They fit my 8 year old Grandaughter.
1.0,The chain broke.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. Poor quality. Cheap material.
1.0,These may be silver in color but are made of plastic.
1.0,"Not worth the money, cheap product."
1.0,This chain arrived broken and unable to be fixed. It's not worth returning really because of shipping. My son wanted this for christmas. A bit disappointing
1.0,I have ordered these before and they were perfect but the product has clearly changed and now they slide down and do not stay up on my feet. I am very disappointed as these were the perfect socks.
1.0,"This dress is of rather poor quality. It fits incredibly loosely, I purchased a large (I am 5’9” and busty)  and honestly could have maybe fit in a small. The material is very thin, and doesn’t hold its shape at all. The length came above my ankles and fits more like a tent."
1.0,"This COOFANDY Mens 3PC Paisley Vest Tie Set Jacquard Necktie and Pocket Square is a nice idea.  It’s great to have a matching vest, necktie, and pocket square for special occasions.<br /><br />However, every item in this set is small.  Even if you follow the sizing chart, the vest is a bit too small - very tight in the chest if I try to button mine.  The tie is a full 5 inches shorter than standard neck ties, and it’s a full inch narrower. The pocket square is several square inches smaller than standard pocket squares as well.<br /><br />All three pieces come folded up with very severe creases in them, and because everything is 100% polyester, you must be very careful and only iron at a very low setting - it’s difficult to iron neck ties and have them turn out properly."
1.0,"I first ordered a size 4 in this suit. When I put it on my larger 3 year old the shirt, vest and jacket were a bit snug but not so tight that I felt like it wasn’t going to work. However, when I put the pants on they were so big and long they barely stayed up and were bunched up at the ankle. I thought maybe if I ordered a 4T instead of the size 4 it would fit better, however when it the “4T” arrived it was the EXACT same one. No difference what so ever! So the the whole 4 vs 4T in this case is a fallacy even though there is typically a real difference between the two. Returned one and kept one even though I’m not actually all that happy with it, just can’t seem to find anything else right now."
1.0,Item was not worth the price and nothing like the pictures. Packaging seem like it was used and the gold is faded already. Literally took it out the package looking like this. Won’t be purchasing again.
1.0,product defective. bad seller
1.0,Very Very Very small. Had to return. Does not look like pic! Do not waste your time you will be mad!
1.0,Would work as a shirt. Literally didn’t even cover my butt! Crap. Don’t buy it.
1.0,"Bought for a costume, they smell terrible and glad I only had to use for one day"
1.0,"It's not real leather. It's a strange rubber coated cloth. It rips easy, not very playable or comfortable. It arrived damaged. Not for the working man. Save your money, because I waisted mine on this."
1.0,"No support!!! Wont held them in place.....I bought the because of somo of the good reviews, but the have no support, not a sportsbra!!"
1.0,"I really liked the bracelet when i first got it but less than 2 months later unknowingly one of the stones fell out,<br /> so disappointing because i thought it was very nice and looked good while wearing. unfortunately return window closed, nonreturnable, unusable. So i am unfortunately disappointed in N.J. Sharing this story and the image because the bracelet is not cheap at around 80 bucks and other potential buyers should consider what happened to my purchase probably a rare thing to happen but as visible above has."
1.0,I do understand that the description said loose but wow.  The top part of the dress was true to size the bottom half of the dress was very loose and unflattering.  It reminded me of a bell. I did contact the seller and they did agree that I could return it.  It would cost almost as much to return as it was to purchase it.  I will end up donating this dress.  I am 5'5 and the dress just hit the top of my ankle.  The dress itself was beautiful and the colors were exactly as pictured.
1.0,This necklace was disappointing. The clasp came broken. The stones are super small. The yellow stone is white. These stones don’t look real. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Terrible! It came without a belt buckle! Just a useless piece of leather! First product I’ve ever had to return through Amazon l!
1.0,Way too loose. Not as advertised. I ended up returning this item. There were also threads coming out before I tried it on
1.0,For $25 I expect a little more. It felt very cheap. The material is like paper mashe. I felt like if I pulled it with a bit a strength it would easily rip.
1.0,"Cheap quality .  Much larger than pictured,  Posts are not centered in the middle , so earrings hang weird"
1.0,These pants are by far the worst fit ever . They are marked as a large and literally fit like childrens pants. I mean come on I couldn’t even pull them on by far the worst sizing I have ever seen these definitely aren’t sized for woman 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻🤬
1.0,I wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase this dress!!! EVERYTHING about this dress is horrible....
1.0,Product arrived in pieces.  Looks like it would be really cute.
1.0,"It did not fit. I have large birds, brahmas and this was too big for them. They may fit a duck or goose."
1.0,Great for theme bracelet t....bad for everyday wear
1.0,I AM NOT EXAGGERATING.  THIS IS CHEAP CARDBOARD COVERED BY THE FLIMSIEST PIECE OF PLASTIC.  I RETUNED MINE RIGHT AWAY.  JUNK
1.0,Después de un tiempo cambio.de color
1.0,These are cheeply mad and fall apart after 1 wask
1.0,So stiff.  Very very stiff.<br />No way would I try and wear.
1.0,"This dreaa got a lot of good reviews.  I don't know how. The fabric was sheer, you could see everything. The tag was ripped out so no idea if it was the right size but sure didnt fit like it was. It went back without hesitation."
1.0,This top was paper thin and even felt like paper. It ran a little smaller than expected but the material was the worst problem. Returning!
1.0,"I wear slippers daily due to neuropathy and swelling of my feet.  These slippers were comfortable, but they shed all over my house. When I take them off my feet are covered in fuzz from the slipper. I washed them and that did not help the situation. If you like peeling fuzz off your toes, then I'd say they may be right for you. I wore them 2 days and never again. Wish I could get refund."
1.0,Fabric and design are not as shown. Returned it for refund
1.0,I did not like this item. It looks like a nightgown
1.0,"I received it broken!!! It's so awful. I hate it!!! Don't buy it! Never ever, 😠"
1.0,I ordered this jacket in an XL to be on the safe side and it was smaller than what a small should be... also if a terrible smell to it. This is very poor quality.
1.0,Pants are okay but top is way too small
1.0,"I really wanted to love this. But I had to throw it out. I appreciated that the vier part moved up and down. But it is very sheer and my face still got sunburned in Cali sun. And one day as I was putting it on, it just snapped in half. I wasn't doing anything crazy. I've had a visor that is 10 years old and is much better than this one."
1.0,"Description is misleading, says 100% cotton. No label on the actual PJs and there is a stretch to them so there is no way they are 100% cotton. They don't feel like they have any cotton in them. Fabric not very nice at all and I doubt they are breathable. Going back. This is not the first time Amazon has had incorrect or misleading or incomplete descriptions. They are starting to lose it."
1.0,No me ha llegado el pedido. Favor si pueden pasarme el N° de trackking para hacer el seguimiento
1.0,"We ordered a size larger than my toddler is and it was way too small. The cushions are too soft, making it hard for her to walk in them."
1.0,"Seller WOULD NOT issue refund said that they would give me a 10% discount on my next order and after I sent them an email telling them, It wasn’t fair they offered 35% on my next order…Amazon should indicate this seller has a NO REDUND POLICY. I did not like the fit or the neck holder piece, very uncomfortable"
1.0,I like the look and feel of these shorts. But that's about it. I couldn't even get these over my thighs. I ordered these and the white in a medium. The white fit just fine but these fit like a small or an extra small. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This product is awful, arrived with so many holes and is supposedly brand new. I do not recommend for anyone."
1.0,"The mask is very big + very misshapen. It looks like it was flattened and it’s barely curved at all. The actual mask itself appearance wise is pretty nice, but it doesn’t make up for the other flaws."
1.0,"Cheaply made, thin itchy fabric, feels like a cheap $5 kids costume, no other way to describe it. Just terrible."
1.0,"These pajamas ran small & I have purchased this brand before so I expected they would fit the same, but no. The reason that I gave them a low rating is they cannot be dried in the dryer after washing.  Who ever heard of cotton pajamas that must be hung up to dry?"
1.0,easy to broken
1.0,This case was a joke! Cardboard and flimsy plastic.
1.0,It came broken. I didn't even get to see what it was suppose to look like because it was all messed up. Very disappointed
1.0,Weirdest fit ever! I'm 115lbs and got the medium and still was the most awkward fit. Don't waste your time and money!
1.0,Not as expected. Returned item
1.0,Wish I had known that it is not loud at all.  My animals are not afraid of it.
1.0,"Ugly, cheap and poorly made. This is a HUGE disappointment and the necklace looks NOTHING like the one in the picture. I figured it was a knock-off, but for the love of God, the manufactures of this piece of crap need to MAKE AN EFFORT! Even a few of the disc of cheap plastic were lopsided and not fitting properly into their backing. I'd send it back but it's just not worth it. Into the TRASH it goes... Potential buyers need to be warned and save their money."
1.0,"AWFULL ! Fits weird I got an XL because come on it’s coming from China . Still way to small and I’m a M ! It awkward it DOESNT STRAIGHTEN UP CRAP , plus the buckle in the front digs into your soul"
1.0,Small. Not true to size or brand haha
1.0,It doesn't stay put. Edges stick out.
1.0,Very difficult to open/close and the handle broke after one use.
1.0,To big and ugly I will never put this on.
1.0,Do not fit at all.
1.0,"Small.  See through.  The built in bra looks awkward, like you have two round pads on your chest.  The material feels cheap, like it will start to breakdown after the first wash and dry.  Returned them."
1.0,"Looked good but after a couple of days, silver color became bronze. Wish it can be replaced but return period has passed I believe."
1.0,"I can't believe the high ratings on this item that looks like a huge cheap ugly gaudy eye made out of aluminum. Perhaps a child could appreciate this, I would NEVER wear something So cheap and cheesy.save your money!!"
1.0,It's so cute but wayyyyy too small I'm just gonna give it to my 11 year old niece
1.0,The quality is low.  Mine broke within a month.
1.0,Item is extremely thin ..runs small .wonder if it will make it in the washing machine..
1.0,Transparent and material is of bad quality
1.0,It’s made out of very cheap material and one of the zippers broke the same day I bought it. I’m very disappointed in this product.
1.0,Several of the beads were missing.
1.0,Felt like a piece of cheap plastic
1.0,"The dress is very small and not sized accurately.  When I have tried to return, the vendor has failed to provide me with the address to return the item to.  Check the vendor out carefully - do your research before buying because I have found that vendors advertise with “American” names but are actually goods from China with high costs for shipping and returns and not good quality or accurate sizing."
1.0,Loved the fit around and the straps but the cup size is WAY too big. Definitely not a C cup
1.0,This dress looks nothing like the picture. The bottom looks all faded out and I am so disappointed! I ordered these to wear for beach pictures but I will be finding something different! Run small! I will not buy again!
1.0,"The pockets are awkwardly placed very low on the dress, and the way they are sewn makes it obvious from all angles when wearing. I love dresses with pockets but this one would be way better without."
1.0,Zippers and clips started to break off the first week of using it
1.0,arrived BROKEN in six places. thin and flimsy!
1.0,To small not the right color cheap material! Don’t like it give it away
1.0,"My 7 year old son worships this kid Ben, and was so excited to get some of his “mercy”. We were really disappointed in the quality of this shirt. First time I washed it the shirt faded and the logo got lots of cracks through it.<br />Such a Shame. I would not suggest buying it."
1.0,Product is not the same as Walmart rack. Too small and thinner material.
1.0,This product was very disappointing.  It is not true to size. Very small
1.0,"Not great quality, not very flattering"
1.0,The description indicated a cotton/polyester blend.  The tag that would indicate fabric content and washing instructions had been cut out. You can see where it was by the remnant remaining.  I am suspicious that this item is polyester with no cotton content. Material was thin and low quality. I'm returning it.
1.0,"Absolutely terrible quality. The bodice was 90% see through. The fit was ok, I’d say true to size. I ordered a medium and I wear size medium pants and shirts, size 6-8 pants"
1.0,I ordered an extra large and had to give it to my eight-year-old granddaughter
1.0,On star because they were made in china
1.0,"Purchased for my husband on May 2, 2021.<br />After 2 1/2 months the clasp would not hold.<br />Checked with Amazon but said had to be returned by June 2......REALLY.<br />Another reason I cancelled my Amazon Prime. If purchased locally I know I could return within 90 days."
1.0,"Not what pic shows, name is on side of hat and doesn’t have the r at the end of spider"
1.0,"Gonna have to give this one away.  Scratchy fabric, the fit is way off - most certainly not how it looks in  photo"
1.0,Fit was off
1.0,"Dont know what others got, but I got a horrible necklace. The chains are so thick, and not that thin and elegant as it appears on the picture. The bar is way smaller than the picture. Never gonna buy cheap stuff on amazon again."
1.0,Watch quit working soon after opening. Also did not keep time accurately
1.0,The  price  and  it runs large.
1.0,I ordered these for my oculus quest.. They came in a zip lock bag but the bottom of the bag was never sealed so they were all lose in the box and there were only 7 out of the 10 of these tri glide slides .. A waste of time and money.
1.0,Worst product I've ever received from Amazon!
1.0,"It was pretty, just a bit small. My only real qualm was the pain. It felt like the metal was burning through my skin so the magnets could get to each other. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"The product is too large. After a wash, the size shrunk, but the socks would not stay on my foot when I wear them. I had to fix it every couple of steps when I wore them outside. I tried all pairs now, and I'm confident that none of them worked."
1.0,Not what I expected. Disappointing.
1.0,Material is super thin the size is ridiculously huge for a face covering.
1.0,These were a waste of money! Awful product!
1.0,"They fit as expected, they just ball up when washed. ( I wash all my pants on cold delicate cycle and hang them up to dry) The material is also very thin and see through."
1.0,Way smaller than it states.
1.0,Es de muy mala calidad se le rompió el cable de la Luz enseguida
1.0,"poorly made, the heel came off after wearing them just once. my daughter cried the entire night because her feet were hurting. the shoe offers zero support, just a costume type shoe that can really only be worn once."
1.0,"The sweatshirt I paid for was a heathered charcoal, ultra thin, loose cut with boat neck and long length.  What I received was a grey sweatshirt like what I could buy from Hanes.  Literally, just a basic dark grey round neck, thick elastic, boxy cut, very thick fabric basic sweatshirt.  I wish these Chinese knock-offs would just post the photo of the REAL ITEM they are sending you, not the marketing photos of the item they are copying."
1.0,good product!  I tried one pair and never could get them on even after washing by the instructions
1.0,Too Small And Too Thin
1.0,chips of blue paint and glitter before you put it on. :(
1.0,Itchy. Small. Not what is shown in the picture.
1.0,I brought the socks my 4yr and they were way too small. These are baby baby socks
1.0,"I bought it because in the description it said it was cotton and it is not, it also runs small and I am petite, my weight 124 pound and height 1.62.<br /><br />Where is amazon quality control on these items, they should not sell items that are not as described.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot return the item since I dont live in the USA and it will cost me."
1.0,It shrunk after first wash. Runs small
1.0,"Cheap plastic, maybe good for a kid, not a good alternative for higher end fashion sunglasses."
1.0,"The body of the shirt is too big. The arms are too small. I ordered up a size larger than I usually wear as other reviewers suggested. Also, I can’t return it. Not happy with this purchase at all."
1.0,"On web site Saids come with leather case NO did not, Aldo said come with soft tissue to clean is faulse did no come eather‼️ Is a shame how toke advantage of us as customers  I feel betteya and Lied completely<br />Want my money back"
1.0,"Needs shatterproof crystal. Two watches, both crystals shattered very quickly."
1.0,I wish it had fit me better its to tight
1.0,I ordered unicorn #1 but received unicorn #2. The bag it came in is labeled as #1 but the contents are incorrect.  Super disappointing since it's not what I wanted. Looks cute otherwise.
1.0,I got to wear this ONE time. As I was taking it off the strap broke! The plastic parts on the front of the bra holding the straps also dug in my skin on certain movements. Terrible! Most disappointing is it BROKE! I'll never get to make use of it again.
1.0,"I rarely give a poor review, but this product is pretty horrible.<br />The under chin strap is totally useless since the buckle is a cheap price of stamped plastic that isn’t properly stamped. The strap will not go through the buckle at all. Even if it did, it is cheap and will readily break with any tension.<br />Surely making a hat that is one-size-fits-all is a challenge, especially if Big Foot is in your target range of head sizes. The bungee draw cord at the rear off the hat is a feeble attempt to provide adjustability but even when pulled tightly, the hat is just too large for us mere mortals.<br />The face shield is quite generous too and has no adjustability so it serves little purpose unless your only goal is to hide your face so you can rob the local convenience store.<br />My advice would be to make several sizes available to overcome the design shortcomings, and hire a real quality assurance team that actually inspects the product prior to shipping."
1.0,"I love the shoes but the buckle keep falling off, already lost them"
1.0,I laughed when I saw this skirt. Don’t buy It. Very ugly. I got the yellow one.
1.0,"Cheap transparent fabric, tiny cut. The picture was a cute dress. Not as great in person."
1.0,I did not like the material. I returned it but it came back to me. I was so angry that it was returned that I just gave it to Goodwill. I don’t want anything for this company again.
1.0,"Bad,bad,bad...."
1.0,"These earrings arrived on time, and looked very, very close to what I wanted. However, instead of saying &#34;KC&#34; for the Kansas City Royals, they said &#34;UK&#34; for the University of Kentucky."
1.0,If I find one I’ll let you know so far not as advertised.
1.0,"Lasted me two weeks, the blue light filter fades off after a while"
1.0,So disappointed I can't even wear it
1.0,"The drawstring doesn’t work, it is sewn on. Also the small is too large, fits more like a medium"
1.0,En esta específicamente muy chica las otras que he comprado muy bien excelente
1.0,Super thick unbreathable
1.0,wearable but short
1.0,Black wears off pretty quick and has started to stain my dress shirt sleeves!
1.0,Not happy with this. Why put seam ends on the front? Hoped to have a pretty kimono for work. Looks tacky and unprofessional. Won't wear for work. Would not buy again
1.0,"Not sure if Cosmos changed product or if Amazon is flooded with cheap substitutes from marketplace sellers, but I've purchased from two sellers in recent weeks.  These are terrible, thin, and ineffective...a real switch from the same product purchased in 2013."
1.0,Both watches sent to me did not work.
1.0,The top is perfect for anyone who's boobs resemble two small horizontal bananas.
1.0,poor quality not at all as appears on the website
1.0,"I got the largest size, which my measurements are in range for, and it BARELY fit me around the chest, and hugged everything else in a way I did not find flattering. It also arrived with an spot between the bodice and skirt that didn't get sewn down correctly. Cute dress, but not made to correctly accommodate curvy women."
1.0,The chocker is too small cover half of my neck the bracelet too big
1.0,The band is pretty but the link removal tool broke immediately and the pins aren't actually part of the watch so I can see them getting lost immediately. I already had to send back because the links weren't even included the first time. I quickly got a replacement but just not good quality. To be expected with the low price. I don't recommend
1.0,The mask fit my 9 year old perfectly. Unfortunately the strap tore off it the first time he put it on. So didn't get to use it for school.
1.0,Took forever to get .
1.0,to small had to return
1.0,The material fit was not as rich texture as expected. My derier area made the lines look black and white and stretched. I had to return
1.0,"Not like the picture,very cheaply made"
1.0,"Green size small.  It is just plain ugly, material scratchy, not soft.  Pockets give extra hip attention, and not in a flattering way.  The slits pop out at the top of the and are cut to high up and have a rounded U shape at the top and makes them look silly.  Also the piece of material across the back of the neck is too short and pull the shoulders in and looks ridiculous.  I will return it for sure."
1.0,I only received one sock. Customer service reps are unresponsive.
1.0,While trying to put this ratings in they broke so I never got to wear them.
1.0,If my toddler made this ... I would be ashamed to even look at it! I am surprised that they sell a product that will only cost then money because they will pay for shipping to send it and return it !
1.0,Color was nothing like the photo. Wanted a pale light blue but it is more like a brighter Carolina blue.
1.0,Tarnished first day warn. Needs clear coat.
1.0,The shirt is cropped.
1.0,Pretty sure they sent an xl in kids.  VERY small!
1.0,"Chain arrived already broken into small pieces. Since I had planned this for a Halloween costume, it is too late to order another for my purposes. I'll take the hit. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Cheaply made, does not work. I had to return it because it did not open easily and looked too cheezy."
1.0,"I ordered 2 of these for each of my girls for Christmas. This one arrived with the top ONLY!! I don't really care about the white belt, but NO PANTS?!?? REALLY???"
1.0,Came in the package all tangled. While tryin to untangle it the metal chain broke apart. Ended up just throwing it away. Don't waste the money.
1.0,"It was a gift for my hubby, sadly is far from what was advertised, colors are not bright at all, it seems as if I bought it in 1984 and kept it under the sun till today. The printing quality is below ok. Not recommended at all!"
1.0,I am disappointed in the look and feel of this dress. It is certainly not worth $29.99. I ordered a medium although I wear a small in this type of dress.  It is too tight in my bust area and way too big in my waist area! I am small chested...so I don't understand the sizing of this dress. I am returning immediately! I read the reviews which is what I always do before ordering. It was not what I expected! Disappointed!
1.0,"The stitching and panels are not done well, so it doesn't lay nicely in xxl.  In a smaller size this wasn't a big issue though."
1.0,The bag was ok looking but was made with cheap materials. The strap broke right after the return period ended. Since when does Amazon only have a 30 day return period? I'm very disappointed.
1.0,Didnt fit as expected..
1.0,"I ordered the one with the stars.  It took about a month and a half to arrive.  It looks nothing like the picture in terms of fit, colors, and textures.  It is weirdly small, not sweatshirt material at all, but rather some shiny, cheap material.  I'd like to return it, but it's probably not worth my effort."
1.0,"Not very flattering. In the picture the coat looks like it drapes nicely. But with it on I looked like a number 8. To be fair, I am between sizes in Northface. My bust is 42&#34; so I ordered the XL. The large probably would have fit better. The sleeves are generous for my long arms ( I am 5'10&#34;). Just too shapeless for what I wanted."
1.0,Could not wear them made my ears sore.
1.0,"The button that attaches the strap to the mask failed the first time I tried to reposition it. I know this is a cheap toy, but the hardwear shoud allow at least one button removal before failing. Good thing I bought this ahead of schedule and don't need it yet. It would be a terrible surprise if it happened on Halloween."
1.0,Was completley unsatisfied with the material and the box like shape. It is not the shirt shown here the colors are similar but definitely not what I was expecting. I will be sending  it back. I'm not keeping something so deceiving.
1.0,I am very disappointed in this charm!  With in two days half of the lettering was already wore off! It is not worth the money.
1.0,These came defective/melted and were three sizes smaller than ordered.
1.0,Item looked nothing like the picture. Very flimsy. Could probably fit pictures in there but not credit card. Requested a refund and still no response
1.0,Please save yourself some time and order at least 2 sizes larger than you think you'll need.<br />Beautiful color. Nicely lined. I ordered another one 2 sizes up. I'm awaiting it's arrival.
1.0,The strings broke and I lost the pendant. I would give 0 stars but the lowest I can go is 1.
1.0,"I have never been so disappointed in a product. I knew that with larger breasts (36D) these wouldn’t be super supportive and I was okay with that. I bought an XL and L to see which would work better.  The only different is the band size. Both have the same size cups which is insane.  The elastic band doesn’t stay under your breasts unless you pull it down and then your nips pop out the top. The support is the least of the issues with these tissue paper bras.  I got these on clearance from a big retailer for $11 and I still think it’s too much.  They are poorly made, super thin, and the sizing is all wrong. Worth less than the crappy sports bra multipacks at tj maxx. This company is a bummer."
1.0,The pin is actually gorgeous BUT it's a little more than an inch in size. Look at the photos of the models wearing the pin. If you think your pin will be that size you'll be sorely disappointed.<br />The only saving grace is that I didn't buy the silvertone one as well.
1.0,Broke 3 days  after the return policy. Will not re-buy ever
1.0,"If you need a coat to wear while you take out the trash, this is the coat for you."
1.0,“Sweatsuit”... this is literally tissue paper. It’s see-through even with minimal light. The whole outfit is NOT as pictured. The shirt has strange tight sleeves that end halfway up the bicep and there’s a seam that makes the shoulder part puff out. It’s like wearing a t shirt with tight long sleeves rubber banded to it. Horribly ugly and not as advertised.
1.0,They are bit smaller than they mentioned size over the post.
1.0,"I used these for two kids. Neither worked, and water got in no matter what we did. Swim instructor even noted the low quality."
1.0,The size 9 year boys bathing suit has no lining-it is spandex material and fits like tight boxers for a 6 year old!
1.0,Broke with in two days. Very disappointed
1.0,This was disappointing. The fit was shapeless and very unflattering. Very cheaply made. Returning it.
1.0,"I ordered an Indigo blue tote but was sent a tote that was part Indigo blue and MOSTLY Fuchsia pink.<br />I find it odd that pink was not shown in the photo nor was it offered as a color choice?!?  So I asked for a refund and placed another order for an Indigo blue tote bag, hoping that the seller will get it right this time.<br />Very disappointing not to mention an inconvenience returning the item."
1.0,"literally plastic cloth, bad quality. Too expensive for being plastic cloth"
1.0,It was a goat not a llama. Gift was a bust
1.0,my child didn't even get to wear it! The stings on the pants completely came undone
1.0,"Too small. The top of the shirt is wider, and the bottom is very narrow. It's also made of a very thick, synthetic,  sweater-like material, and does not look light weight like it does in the picture."
1.0,The hat is too little and badly shaped bad choice on my part for buying.
1.0,Very cheap made and cheap looking gum ball machine quilty .
1.0,Cheap!  I like the color and the mixture of fabrics<br />But returned the jacket. The sizing sucks!<br />Big letdown ☹️
1.0,This item was really a piece of junk. I was very disappointed with the quality of the item. This item looked cheap and more of dollar tree quality. I wouldn’t recommend this item.👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
1.0,They're not oversized
1.0,Wasn't true to its size !
1.0,Don't waste your money on this watch. The clasp broke on my first attempt to adjust it.
1.0,"While the material was soft, the thinness of the leggings caused the pants to be opaque at best when worn. Also, the material hangs loosely, not form fitting. They might be good for a hot sleeper as PJ bottoms, but this product does not meet my expectations."
1.0,If it's clothing made in China or any other asian country. Don't bother getting. It won't fit.
1.0,"Don't know how they fit, because they were already worn by someone else! Had a run in them already."
1.0,"These gloves are fairly warm if they do not get rain or snow on them but are horrible if they get wet. I went on a snow ride(sxs) in 30 degree weather wearing these and my friend had to let me borrow a pair of 2 dollar brown cotton work gloves that did a better job of keeping my fingers warm. They do look nice though, just don't get them wet."
1.0,"Good quality, but if you have larger breasts they are spilling out sides"
1.0,"Not at all like described. Expected denim capris, got ugly stretchy Mom jean capris. Not even denim. I will wear them around the house to clean."
1.0,"Just got these in the mail today (they were meant to be a gift...) and there is a hole in the inner lining with brown marks around it. Not sure what that is from. I am returning these, and although they were what I was looking for, I won't order them again."
1.0,"This product is not what they say, no type of support"
1.0,"I ordered a 2x, knowing that some brands run small, and couldn't even get the top on. I gave it to a petite friend to wear.  What a waste of money!!!"
1.0,This dress looked like a Capri length dress on my 5”3 daughter. I had to buy her another dress and I couldn’t return this one because it’s past the return period. I ordered early to make sure my daughter would get the dress in time for homecoming but that backfired.
1.0,Very cheap appearance and quality
1.0,I’ve ordered this in other colors and have been able to return it for free through Amazon but apparently ordering this color charges you to return even if the quality isn’t what is expected. Save yourself the hassle and the money DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,One work - yuck
1.0,Looks cheap bad quality and too big. Never wore this. It tarnished by itself just sitting in my jewelry box. Bad buy!
1.0,Chipped after less than a month.
1.0,"Definitely more like tights than leggings. Oval section sewn in the crotch area like tights, rather large, seams make it feel like the tights are falling down even when they are not. Thicker than tights, but not what I was expecting. Did not wear, so can't speak to durability. Will return."
1.0,"This product was close to see through, I’m not sure what it will protect against."
1.0,Did not work for me & not easy to remove links
1.0,"I AM a small, about a size 4 or 5 and these were too small and flimsy. Not worth the price so I sent back"
1.0,Actually a horrible purchase. The feathers are constantly coming out and it has a very strange odor that hasn’t gone away after several washes.
1.0,They didn't fit anyone's shoes.
1.0,"I purchased to wrap up my hair at night or during the day! The scarf measurement are correct according to description however the photo in the description is not what I ordered. I orders a scarf with bold royal blue trim and this doesn’t have it, also the scarf on the model has so much more fabric/longer then the true measurements.  Otherwise ok product."
1.0,"Too short for us, and too boxy, not like a fitted T on top, but a tunic pulled together with elastic. Returned item"
1.0,Feels and looks like I'm wearing a paper bag as a pair of shorts.
1.0,Runs very small.  Maybe it’s a 32A sized for 36C
1.0,To small and the neck was stretched in the back. I had ordered a large the first time and it was to big. Thought I would order 2 medium and they were to small. Oh well...
1.0,The cufflinks sent to me did NOT match the picture. Do NOT purchase this if you expect to receive what the picture looks like. Very disappointed. I received cheap looking plastic basketball cufflinks. DEFINITELY not worth the money.
1.0,Very disappointed. The sizing shown on this product on the website is incorrect. It states L = 7.5-8.5 when actually on the product itself it says L = 9-10. This is way too big and I need to return.
1.0,"I followed most comments and ordered a size up. I normally wear a size small, but for this I ordered a size Medium which was size 4-6, which is my size. The bathing suit was cute. I can't deny that. The material, however, felt really cheap. It felt more like a makeshift silk material rather than the normal elastic bathing suit material. The seams did not blend well in the top or bottom. In the top, there is a large seam going straight down the front of the bathing suit. The ends that you use to tie the bathing suit seemed to have just been clipped when some scissors. The elastic at the ends were sticking out. For the bottoms, again, the seams did not blend well. The bottoms were not was not elastic at all, so it did not stretch to put them on. It seemed to be a piece of string that was holding the top of the bottoms together. Overall, I would not buy this."
1.0,"I thought the design was adorable, as I love sheep, but the &#34;denim&#34; color is not as expected. It is actually a very dark blue, which means that the black parts of the sheep don't show up. Instead they look like little amorphous white blobs. Not exactly what one is going for when one buys a sheep patterned scarf. The scarf itself seems to be decent quality, and if I hold it up to a bright light the print looks fine. Not sure how the other colors would look, they would probably be ok. Since the price was very reasonable and it shipped from China, I'm just going to bite the bullet and pretend they are clouds in a night sky."
1.0,They are very heavy. Not pretty at all. Disappointed.
1.0,The buckle is scratched. Do not recommend.
1.0,"Way too large. Fit awkward. It’s form Shein, so I bought it here since you can’t return to them. Glad I did, since now I need to return"
1.0,Do not waste your money
1.0,"After 1 wash shrank two sizes, would never recommend this product."
1.0,"Horrible color arrived. Neckline is not the same. Overall very unflattering. The bottom is very small, so you have to take very small steps just annoying and ugly"
1.0,too hot
1.0,Lost 2 stones within 3 hours :(
1.0,did not like at all... was to big and spandex like material. i dont wear it not happy...
1.0,It fell apart after proximately  seven wears. Obviously not made by a Marine!
1.0,"Not like the picture advertised, face so dark y can’t read the time, you have to hold it at a certain angle to see what time it is. I returned it and got a full refund minus shipping"
1.0,So very disappointed. Fit was way off and it was poorly constructed.
1.0,Very very cheap
1.0,"Either it doesn't actually work for D cups or I did it wrong.<br />Whichever,  it was a bad decision purchase on my part."
1.0,The material is terrible. It does not fit loose as it appears in the picture. I did not return it because there was no paperwork included in the package. Money lost!
1.0,Arrived late
1.0,"Had to return, ordered expecting an oversized comfy sweater. Fit as a normal sweater, hit at the waist, no slouch at all and the material was on the itchy side"
1.0,Very thin and plastic like. Very disappointed.
1.0,The artificial product.
1.0,"Severely disappointed inthese socks. They are sized very small even before washing them. They rode down to my ankles, didn't wick moisture away and even after washing them twice they cover my feet with fabric strands. Would have been better off buying a 6 pack of Haynes or Fruit of the Loom crew socks."
1.0,This may be the cheapest sweatshirt material I’ve ever seen. The frog is basically a sticker that looks like it’s about to peel off. It’s super thin and smells. Returning immediately!
1.0,Fits extremely too small a large doesn't even go over my thighs and I'm a size 10. I wouldn't recommend. Shipping took forever and didn't have time to exchange before trip due to this issue
1.0,"—if this was helpful, please click “helpful”—<br /><br />Yuck this looked atrocious on me! Very unflattering. The top of the tank is very wide and strangely cut. I purchased a small, too. The x is in the back and not the front as well. Strange. Save your money.<br /><br />For more beauty reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram!"
1.0,"Design flaw and/or wrong chain. I really liked the idea of this, and the cage is well build and locks firmly, the problem is the chain. It kinked within 5 min of wearing it and continues to kink again and again. It has something to do with the fact that it is permanently welded to the hex loop not allowing it to swing freely - that, and the fact that the chain is either square or flat so that it catches on itself. I think a rope or round chain would not have this problem. As a result it twists and twists like a telephone cord and spirals up actually bending the links so that when you untwist it the kinks are permanent. So, while the idea was great I had to return it."
1.0,Not happy with quality. AT ALL.
1.0,I couldn't get the silver one to open. Very hard to close and if you have a high priced septum its not large enough.
1.0,CHEAP!
1.0,"what looks like a set of 2 bras (as I have purchased in the past with this brand) is actually only one bra.  The picture shows 2 bras - one white, one beige.  I mistook this to mean that this was a set of 2 bras - one white and one beige.  But in fact, it is only one beige bra.  I won't buy from this vendor again.  Misleading."
1.0,"Stone in ball fell out within 30 days. Called Mr Piercing left numerous messages, no return calls.<br />Emailed them and they couldn’t find order, said they would send a replacement. Ball sent did not fit, and crystal was a colored.<br />Called and left numerous unanswered messages. Emailed. Finally they said send back.<br />Am skeptical but will send.<br />IF I could give 0 stars I would. Also, if I get the replacement and it’s better quality, I will adjust stars."
1.0,Ordered the 3x because I can usually fit a one to xxl  wow... The 3x is like a large
1.0,Material looked like and felt like a costume. Didn't find this flattering.
1.0,I did not liked it. Its so big it can cover my whole face .
1.0,Ordered an adult XL and it fit like a S. Order up in size!
1.0,Had to send back. Came ripped up. No apology or offer for another hat to replace?
1.0,En la ibfirmacion dice que son 2 unidades y yo solo recibi 1.
1.0,Stolen artwork. Very shameful.
1.0,I was aware from the reviews that the Jacket sizes run small so I ordered an extra large and they still sent me a large. This was very unfortunate for me being that I needed it for work and now I have to go out of my way to send it back and wait on another one. I could not be any more dissatisfied. The jacket is nice but my receipt says extra large and there is no excuse for that.
1.0,"Cheap, thin, and bent. These are really poor quality."
1.0,Not as in photo. Fabric is low grade denim. Not true to size.
1.0,"The band was attached slightly askew, so it did not sit right when on the wrist.  I returned it."
1.0,"They tarnished, very poor quality. Made my ear lobes itch. Shouldn't get any stars."
1.0,"Entirely too small!!  I usually wear a large or XL, got a 2XL just in case, and was still way too tight in the shoulders!! (I'm 5'4, around 150, and have a large bust). The difference between an XS and a 2XL in the shoulders is LESS THAN 2 INCHES!! Had to return!!"
1.0,They broke within days of my kids using them.
1.0,"Demasiado pequeños y los recibí dañados y no los puedo usar, los tire a la basura"
1.0,Fell off of my wrist 3 times.
1.0,"The image of the dress appears to be a satin. The dress I received is a cotton like material. And the dress does not even have ruching. Unfortunately I’m not attaching a pic of the actual dress, due to the fact that I immediately packaged the dress up for return. Honestly, I’m not even giving it a chance stricture on the strength of it not being what I expected. If you’re expecting the dress in this image, DO NOT ORDER or you’ll be disappointed too"
1.0,Multicolored Dress: Too small. Completely see through. Colors not as vibrant. Didn't come with belt. Looks and feels like a knock off. Very disappointed.
1.0,Should have been listed as a child's shirt
1.0,Terrible - doesn't hold anything in because the fabric doesn't have any structure to it they're basically just high-waisted shorts.  Definitely do not recommend if you're trying to hold in a gut.
1.0,"It came in a very small size, and tight.  Terrible"
1.0,"Skirt is too stiff, too thick, too hot.The skirt portion feels like thick flannel material that has been starched and ironed."
1.0,Watch winder doesnt work well. Keeps moving out of place and makes clicking noise. Cheap construction
1.0,"I have had the coat just over a month. I purchased it for wearing when I go to town to run errands which isn’t very often, I’ve only worn it a handful of times. It pills a lot and loses fuzz. There was fuzz all over anything that touched the coat, including my hair. I could have lived with it, but then it got a giant hole at the front of the shoulder seam. I was very careful to treat the coat well, and all it took was the movement of putting it on and driving somewhere to rip it. I would not recommend this coat at all."
1.0,"Everything fits nice on these pants, but just because it’s cheap doesn’t mean it’s just “a good deal” i had to oil the zipper bc it was so corroded and gross it wouldn’t even zip up anymore then I noticed all of the metal components even the button was also corroded. I am able to replace those so I thought nothing of it. I tried these pants on, holding my nose; they reek of chemicals and soy sauce, and I barely started to pull them up and the fabric by the belt loop in the back completely ripped open. No big deal, I can fix it. Next I fully get them on and button them, I take 3 steps and it rips from the crotch seam to the back pocket. The fabric is so old and decrepit that it tears extremely easily. The little decor they put onto the pants is literally glued on and barely holding anymore. Please don’t buy these."
1.0,"I bought three of these shirts in different colors because I liked the way they looked in the pictures.  The actual products are terrible.  The label claims they are made from “98% cotton 2% other”.  Either that is just a flat lie, or the “other” is something really strange, because these shirts feel like they are stitched together from thick plastic hefty bags.  The material doesn’t breathe and is extremely stiff, heavy and sticky like plastic.  Also the colors don’t look anything like the pictures.  The yellow shirt I bought is a bright clown yellow that I would never wear out in public.  The fit was also on the small side.  I tried washing the shirts a few times to see if that would help anything, but it just made them super wrinkly."
1.0,"This was two sizes too small. I wear L/XL and this L fit like a small.  I returned it, although the style was nice."
1.0,Can I return it. Not want I wanted. Thank you
1.0,sent 2 right foot boots
1.0,you can't see the picture with your eye.  the bracelet even comes with instructions to use your phone's camera to see the picture.  it is a total rip off.
1.0,Size at bust is incorrect. Very disappointed!
1.0,Size was way too small.
1.0,"I hoped that by spending a ridiculous amount of money on a Woolrich hat, that I would get quality. Boy was I wrong. I've had it a month, and it's fine--except the color is fading--and I haven't even used it in the sun that much. I know that black often fades in the sun faster than other colors, but I also know that cheap dye jobs fade fastest of all. If you want to spend 5 times as much as you have to to get a hat that looks all orange-black sun-bleached fade after one month of minor use in the sun, this is the hat for you. Whoever invented the phrase, ""you get what you pay for"" probably was rewarded with one of these hats by a disgruntled believer. Oh, to have been born a genetic mutant with all thumbs--so I could point all of them DOWN for this hat."
1.0,"Los pedi pink y me llegaron de este color que corresponde a otro, esto no fue lo que solicité"
1.0,Waste of money. Can't return either.
1.0,"I bought this to be cool & comfortable. However, the fabric is too see through to wear without a slip. And, it's too short to wear a slip."
1.0,The strap broke the first day I used it. I was on vacation in Vegas and had to buy another purse to carry...:(
1.0,i believe i purchased a large and it was above my belly button.
1.0,No mention of size anywhere in listing. Attempted to use this stretcher on my men's size 12 boots and they max out before I get any decent pressure. Another product description fumbled between China and Amazon resulting in wasted carbon transporting this product that I never would have ordered in the first place.
1.0,"Not a dress for me!  The material seemed nice but I could not get a size to fit me. I tried the 1X and 2x (for reference my bust is 44&#34;, waist 40&#34;).  2x was too big and the 1x I could not zip up because the band of fabric does not stretch!  Also it is a little more low cut than it shows in the picture."
1.0,"These are cheap and smelled like chemicals.  I threw them away without wearing.  Not worth my time to return, wouldn't donate them to my worst enemy."
1.0,"I previously had this bra a couple of years ago with no problems. Unlined, great summer bra. But this one squeaks between the rings and the strap in the back whenever I move.  It's a design flaw.  I think it's too late to return but I'm disappointed. I'm an average size .person wearing a 34C"
1.0,It is plastic and cheap
1.0,"i have ordered several pieces from NYC. They are rhodium dipped. i bought this bracelet and ring seperately.<br />With in a month, ALL ORANGE, RHODIUIM WORE OFF.<br />I bought them to wear when i travel(dont want to loose the real jewelery)<br />Now what do I do with a black velvet bag, w blue letters????  im pissed. Not that cheap.<br />Please tell me how to oroceed with this VERY FAKE looking jewels that are ORANGE.<br />THANK YOU,<br />Rachel Greco~Macias"
1.0,The movement is very cheap and the second hand is stuck resulting in 5 min lost per hour
1.0,After less than a year the gold is starting to unravel along the edge making sharp spots and almost unwearable.<br />While it is a beautiful bracelet my wife is very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />Hoping to contact the seller about replacing or repairing
1.0,Worthless sunglasses and worthless night glasses. Totally a scam. Falsely advertised. I want to return them
1.0,Low quality and oversized.  It’s trash
1.0,Chain was broken when the box was opened disappointing for gift.
1.0,Very cheap and wrinkled
1.0,"Too heavy , gets scratched easily."
1.0,Wore a pair first day and they fell apart.
1.0,Absolutely not shock resistant.
1.0,Broke on first day
1.0,Too thin and cheap feeling
1.0,Order 1-2 sizes up
1.0,Bought a 2 pack.  Received ONE!!!!
1.0,Can’t figure out which side is up!!!!
1.0,Ordered the black off the shoulder and I received a black shirt that is a different material and not at all the same style! Returning it! Bad! Missing most of the sleeves!
1.0,One of the earring came with a hole. Unfortunately I have left the country so I can't ask for exchange. I hope you ca...
1.0,"I am 5'9&#34; tall, 180 and wear a 38D bra. I purchases XXL This shirt fit perfectly everywhere but the bust and looks horrible due to how it is cut. Not made for ample chested women."
1.0,the come but they come ripped not a scam but i guess they are what you call fragle
1.0,They broke the first time I used them. I had ordered several pairs other 2 pairs were missing lil stones n kept one n they broke 1st time I used them. Very cheap made
1.0,"Just an extremely cheap and poorly made top. The material reminded me of a cheap table cloth. And the fit is just awkward and bad. Wanted for a renaissance costume, but this isn't worth the money. Returned.....still waiting on my refund. Save yourself the hassle and find a different top."
1.0,"Zero stars if that was possible.,<br />Awful stitching, a hard material like a twist tie that pokes your skin, and cheap material overall. It belongs in a $1 store if that."
1.0,The plastic holders stretched to point they would continually slide off the bows of the eyeglasses. Not worth the purchase.
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I ordered the oysters, charms and chains as a recommended set and the pearls didn't fit in most the charms and the chains had to be altered (basically broken) in order to fit the charms. This was for a birthday party and there were several disappointed kids 😒"
1.0,"Fits awful, too tight on my arms and too baggy everywhere else."
1.0,I did not like anything about it because It didn’t fit
1.0,Way too small and tight fitting
1.0,I am not happy with the purchase of this watch. I wore it on Mother's day and it is broken already. Father's day hasn't come yet. The buckle came off and so did the 2 small straps. It does keep good time. I do not recommend this watch.
1.0,I bought this looking for something I could put on the end of my watch chain.  These are much too small for that.  Can't even attach these to my chain because the loops are much too small.
1.0,Do not purchase these. Horrible buy! One star because Zero isnt an option.
1.0,I wouldn’t recommend this item. In a few days it tarnished. The chain was of very poor quality
1.0,Looks ugly in real life
1.0,Poor quality fabric and the torso doesn’t extend far enough for me (6’). The whole thing feels cheaply made.
1.0,4x size of a large
1.0,"Very cheap watch. Looks good in pictures and at first glance, but the more you look the cheaper it appears. Very cheap manufacturing, and it shows once you try to resize it. It even feels flimsy. The links were clearly machined down after they were pinned together so that they could save money instead of making nicer parts that actually fit together well. I have the tools to resize and work on watches, and I work on my own (as well as others’) mediocre and nicer watches. There is a clear difference now that this has been my experience with a really low end watch. My girlfriend thinks it looks cute though since it’s her first watch. I will likely spend the money on a mediocre improvement for her in the near future (something like an Invicta that’s a bit nicer and easier to work with)."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8ff9fdd2c5eca0fb983327acc215483e]] This is a disappointment at best. The shirt colors are dull and not bright like shown. The sleeves do not match the pattern of the shirt because they are plain with no pattern as shown. The interior of the hood and shirt are white not the same color as the shirt as shown. The size runs small as well. It took a little time to arrive but not to bad. The material itself is not to bad. Wish it was as shown.
1.0,Its not true to size
1.0,These earmuffs are huge/bulky in comparison to my usual 180s (see photo).  I like to put them in my purse or pocket when I take them off indoors; I could not do that with the Halemet Unisex EarMuffs.
1.0,Is nothing compare with the one in the picture. The colors are completely different. Looks very old fashion
1.0,"Very thin. Soft fabric, but see through. Very small fit"
1.0,The welded loop that enables the cross to hang on a chain broke off the first day my son wore it.  He wasn't yanking on it.  He fastened the necklace in the front and then turned it around and the loop fell off.  Huge disappointment!
1.0,"Thin. Not thick corduroy. More, long shirt. Cute but not worth the coat price. I returned it."
1.0,"Buena calidad, pero demaciado pequeno"
1.0,I loveds the ring but it turned so dull I don't want to wear it.  Needs a way to clean or reshine it.
1.0,"Terrible construction, cheap materials used and a bad attempt at a copy of what is pictured in item description."
1.0,Made with very thin cheap material doesn’t look anything like the picture. I would return but waited to long
1.0,It's plastic. Don't buy it!
1.0,was about the same size roughly as a sleeve off of a shirt could barely get it over my head and when I did it felt like somebody had their hands wrapped around my neck choking me I spent a few minutes trying to alter it to make it fit better but it was a lost cause ended up in the trash ☹️
1.0,"I was so excited to finally receive my bracelet and went to put it on immediately. However, I can't because there's no clasp!! I am so disappointed. Is there no quality control? Who puts a piece of jewelry in a box missing the most important part?"
1.0,Very poorly made. Cute little dress and it fit perfectly but the first time I actually went to wear it the zipper broke and the dress had to be cut off.
1.0,Earrings way too big for my taste
1.0,"looks used - too wide. too flat, no arch support at all - feet will be tired. +only-looks stylish"
1.0,"Way too big, fabric was scratchy"
1.0,"Within an hour of wearing this hat, the brim started to unravel...eventually the hat was in two separate pieces. So disappointed! :("
1.0,Horrible dress didn't even know what it said seems like they just put letters together and put them on the dress not worth the price would not recommend it
1.0,"Well it's hard to review an item when they sent you the wrong one - similar but definitely not what was shown in the pictures. Regardless, I wanted to share with others in case they decide to order this item; given how popular these are becoming.  Bracelet neither came in the cute &#34;leather&#34; box, nor did it match the style shown in photos. The 7th Element item has obvious square cut type indentation for holding the hair band, the one I received does not. It's has a slight curvy indentation.  It's lovely silver, shipped quickly and fits well, but I am worried (given the previous reviews on the style of bracelet I actually received) that when I'm being active, the hair band will slip off rendering it ineffective. Contacted seller, hope to hear something back soon."
1.0,Way to small! I ordered a medium and they are more like an xtra small. It fits my 11 year old daughter who is an xtra small in women's
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!<br />Came way to small, material was awful.<br />So disappointed<br />For my son"
1.0,"These pajamas were not made well at all. Did not fit right. Too tight in arms big in stomach area and too small in bottoms. Not at all like the picture. Oh well, I guess that's the risk when buying online. I recommend you don't get these."
1.0,Stone fell out of piece a few days after wearing.
1.0,This broke within 3 days! My son was so upset. What a waste.
1.0,Cheap materials and way to small And I bought an Xl I'm average guy 5'11 about 170lbs it might be xl on a child.<br />Very poor construction very light weight  looks like something over priced you would grab in a hurry at an Amusement park if you needed one but don't expect it to last.
1.0,I received one size 9 shoe and one size 10.
1.0,Smells like old dirty mildew rags.  Will need to washr and hope it helps. Does not smell like a canvas bag. Do not buy.<br /> Would never give this item to my neice or use for our wedding.
1.0,Does not do anything it says it does. Good news Amazon allowed returned
1.0,"They are cute & tiny! However, they do not have the stick part that goes in your ear very odd!! Should they be considered earrings without having the part that goes into your ear? It also took a long time for these earrings to come in 2mos"
1.0,"The color isn’t as the picture depicts, poor material, terrible shipping time....it’s just a nightmare for a last minute purchase."
1.0,"Only one pair out of the three had the bows attached, they are not sewn on they are glued on. And I did not receive a red pair as pictured I received a white pair with red bows"
1.0,These earrings were to be a gift. They were the worst looking product I have ever ordered on Amazon. The metal had left marks on the feathers from rusting or rubbing the product. The color and quality were both awful. This is actually the first bad review I have ever sent.
1.0,It was cheap and totally a disappointment.
1.0,dislike !!! wish I could send back
1.0,Product came wrinkled and smelled bad in packaging. Fit was way bigger than expected. Awful outfit.
1.0,"Not at all, bat quality"
1.0,"I cannot wear this simply because of the scratchy material.  It is sad, because the design is cute."
1.0,I didn’t even take this product out of the package as it can bunched up and felt hard like a rock. So I returned it unopened
1.0,I waited weeks for this shirt.  Pretty sure it came directly from China. I wanted to return it because it had a very weird cut making it look too big at the shoulders and not in proportion at the bottom. I wear xlarge top and 12-14 pants. The quality of the shirt really is poor. Very disappointed. I guess the nice part was Amazon didn’t want me to return it and gave me my money back. I’ll give it to Goodwill. Thank you Amazon😁
1.0,PILLED badly right away & had to involve my cc co. 2 getare fu nd !
1.0,No! My shell fell out and its truly sad!
1.0,Extremely cheap!!!!!
1.0,"This product is fake leather,, sorry I bought it,"
1.0,Very poor quality- it arrived broken.
1.0,The tape left a sticky residue on my dress and bra.  After multiple washes the residue is still there.  I can no longer wear the dress because of it. It did hold the dress in place.
1.0,I used to buy these and they fit great.  They are no longer fit they are TOO LONG
1.0,No es como esta en la foto falso
1.0,"I wear small to x-small, or 0 in pants. I put these on and they ripped as soon as I put them on. They are not only too small but also such poor quality that they ripped so quickly around my calfs as I put them on. They never made it all the way up :("
1.0,The fit was horrible
1.0,Wanted to like this skirt but it was big on me and the straight style of the skirt wasn’t flattering on me
1.0,Didn’t receive it
1.0,I bought this necklace for my wife and promptly return it upon receipt. It was too short for a 22 inch and the links were too flimsy. It also had a brassy smell to it.
1.0,"Takes three weeks to arrive. It's very sheer lace, but not as long as pictured on the model. I'm 5'3&#34; and it only goes down to the top of my thigh. It's loose and drapey everywhere except on the arms, where it's cut so small that I couldn't get it past my elbows, so forget about getting it onto my shoulders. Plus the ends of the fabric all along the neck and bottom haven't been finished, they're just loose threads that would start to unravel if I wore it for an hour or two."
1.0,Bought this based on the pictures for the heart pirates logo I've and I didn't get any of the mask designs pictured.
1.0,Took forever to arrive . You can not see the picture at all . Don’t waste your money .
1.0,"Is just a latex mask, nothing like the pics. Pics are for the PVC Helmet that i bought already from another seller."
1.0,"Doesnt look like the photo, material is different than it looks in the photo..has no stretch"
1.0,Highly HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED these are NOT big hoop dangle earrings they don’t even look like the size on the woman with red hair<br />I was really excited to get these because they looked cool and different but when I received them...wow totally not worth it they’re the size of a regular house key (small) if you like small hoops go for it but these are not statement pieces
1.0,"Wrong panties. I ordered a waist-high panty with a wide band, super stretchy in the picture. What I got is a standard bikini in non-stretchy cotton. Oddly, I received 10 pairs, not 5. Quite a deal for 5 bucks, but... not what I need in panties."
1.0,Stones fell out first week I wore it.
1.0,"Terrible fit, cheap material.  Awful.  Returned it."
1.0,"Their sizing scale is off by AT LEAST 2 sizes. Got my husband a 2XL, which fits him with every other shirt, but this looked like it was made for a kid.<br />Very short, and way too small. The 2XL is MAYBE the size of a Large.<br />Other issue is that I don't see any free returns button, so I either pay shipping or find a kid to give the shirt to.<br />Maybe I'll just make a pillow out of it.<br />Cute shirt, but useless sizing."
1.0,"it is a plastic rose, not from a real rose"
1.0,"I am small and I could not get the bottoms much past my knees. They also looked very different than the picture, fabric is very thin."
1.0,"Pésima calidad y tamaño muy pequeño, una 2xl, es una L"
1.0,These straps are ridiculously short! They would never be long enough to do a criss cross back.
1.0,For 10 dollars not bad. Came in nice box it's a bit big around my wrist but will take some chain links out then all good. Looks pretty for that price.<br />Can't remove chain links its all glued together. Way to big for me to wear. Also can't open the back to change battery. Used to sell watches and put batteries in. This explains the low price looks good but that's it.
1.0,Did not like material. Thought was more cotton.
1.0,"These lenses did not fit my Spy Cooper sunglasses, careful there maybe Cooper + size as well."
1.0,Do not buy both of the balls fell off! Very disappointed in these!
1.0,While I love the rings I'm disappointed that I was shorted some septums. I did not receive all 20 and I read a review before purchasing that said the same so I'm not sure if the advertising for 20 is false or someone was lazy in their counting. It's a bitter sweet buy
1.0,"I hate it, i am not even going to hear it at the concert…. Really bad quality of picture..looks rally cheap m."
1.0,Item returned.
1.0,This is good for a big kid. It is too small for an adult.
1.0,"This product was a failure, doesn’t spin 😏"
1.0,I wore this one day and it fell apart.
1.0,"As other reviewer said -- Pink is really extremely bright orange-red (more orange).  Much more bright that I would ever wear, and I have some orange-ish red clothing items I think look good on me.  Basically a neon shade, if neon came in red-orange.  The rest of the item looked as pictured.  But... didn't matter as I can't wear this color at all.  I don't think it's a popular shade to wear at all."
1.0,Only the waist is too tight and the other part is big.
1.0,it is like junk
1.0,"I was excited to purchase these because of their style and price. Unfortunately, they do not block any blue light. I have two other pairs of actual blue-blocking glasses of different strengths and in comparison, these do not block any blue light whatsoever. In fact, they seem to almost have a blue-colored film which increases the appearance of blue light. Cute for fashion, but not for function."
1.0,Gave my ear an infection and became irritated. Metal is poor quality
1.0,So uncomfortable and material was scuffed in areas out of the package
1.0,The box was all beat up almost falling apart.
1.0,"I wanted to like these, but I guess I got what I paid for. Out of the box, they looked great. Didn't matter to me that the frames were stiff. I can live with that. But about 2 days after having them, the arm on the left side became so stiff that it won't even close anymore. It SQUEAKS like a badly rusted door. And when I needed to wipe the fingerprints off the lenses, the left lens popped out of the frame. It pops out every time I go to wipe them. Oh well. They sit in the car because I'm not ready to just throw them out yet, but as the frames don't even close, they have to lay on the passenger seat as there is no place to put a half-opened pair of sunglasses. They were too cheap to bother with boxing them up and sending them back. Bought 2 more pairs of sunglasses this week and I made absolutely certain to steer clear of anything made by 5zero1."
1.0,"These socks r not how they r described. Bought mens big and tall,they r long enough,(i think) the top of these socks r so small wont go over husbands calf"
1.0,"3 sizes to small, gave it to my daughter.  would not order again."
1.0,The shoe is not comfortable for walking
1.0,"Buyer beware. Seller is in China, does not accept returns and plays games. The item itself is oversized and flimsy. It looks nothing like the picture. I trusted the good reviews but sometimes they're phony. This is a piece of junk. Do not buy."
1.0,Didn’t care for these at all. No different than any other light lenses sunglasses.
1.0,This sweatshirt was too small. I ordered a large and it was intended for a 12 year old but this was clearly too small to be a large.
1.0,These do not withstand daily use. We have 1 left. The clip breaks from the fabric. Not worth the money.
1.0,Product did not fit as expected!
1.0,They have no prescription. Only a SMALL portion in a corner of the glasses have the prescription but the whole glass doesn’t have any prescription. A waste of money.
1.0,Not sure what happened. I bought my girlfriend 4 of these and this black one smelled god awful and she couldn't wear it.
1.0,"Bought this because of the reviews, especially the one that showed the buyer jumping on the suitcase.  Two trips later, the suitcase has a large crack in one corner.  I have hit polycarbonate with a hammer before and it did not break.<br /><br />I could understand if this had happened after 2 to 3 years, but nine (9) months later just worthless piece of garbage. Hope they honor the three (3) year warranty."
1.0,"Amazing idea, however very cheaply made. Save your money and look elsewhere for something better"
1.0,Not as expected. Material is not as rich as it actually looks. Very thin and inferior looking.
1.0,These are very comfortable - wore out a pair and wanted another for a trip to China which would involve a lot of walking. Unfortunately they offer no and I mean no grip on wet polished marble and granite which most walkways in Shanghai are made of. Nearly broke my neck more than once. Also one of the eyelets fell apart.<br />For a shoe company that makes Top Siders that I have depended on for firm footing on wet fiberglass for years these are a total fail.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable! Actually felt like I was suffocating! I bought them so that when I was getting autographs at a convention, the actor would be able to see my smile. I couldn’t even leave my room with it on for less than one minute!"
1.0,"This bikini fit much smaller than its size. The color was also much less vibrant than shown online. The back clasp was nearly impossible to work, even with assistance. I would definitely not recommend this bikini."
1.0,The zipper split within 30 seconds of trying this on. I did not have it too tight. It wasn't the seem that ripped. The zipper itself was super cheap and weak. I'm sending it back. The rest of it looked nice. But I never got to wear it because the zipper broke instantly.
1.0,my palette came all broken and I couldn't even use it. so sad.
1.0,I purchased this coat to keep me warm but it was not any better than the coat I already had.  PASS!
1.0,Product was advised as 95 % cotton.  This was fake information and a waste of my time.  I have to travel far to return product. The label on dress  I received says polyester I wish this agent will stop this fake advertisement..
1.0,"It only came with blue eyes where the picture shows it having multiple colors lights, straps broke the teeth cut up along face and it warped."
1.0,This product is not advertised.  Looks like a man’s sweatshirt with cheap Colorado decals ironed on the front and back<br /><br />It’s made in China and literally comes from there so if you were not home you would not be able to receive the package because you have to sign for it... would have been nice to know thank God I was home<br /><br />Super cheap material I washed it and it definitely shrank I could see myself wearing it running errands but I would never wear it as a cute fitted sweatshirt like I thought I was buying<br /><br />I would return it but that means I have to ship it back overseas and I do not want to deal with that
1.0,Ordered a medium and it’s like an extra small on me. Very uncomfortable. Didn’t return because I ripped it in the process 🙃
1.0,Not even one star. This dress is a joke. I ordered an XXXL and it won't even fit over my breasts. So disappointed I wasted $40.00.
1.0,it is nothing like advertised. Cheap quality I want to return it.
1.0,Don’t like.. wasn’t cute. Kinda cheap looking. Returned
1.0,low quality fabric..
1.0,These are the worst earrings!!! They do not close! I’ve just spend an hour trying to wrestle them closed! They do not click closed. I’ve tried several of them and a few I cannot close with out being in my ears. I have septum rings with the same style clicker and they were hard to go in these are so much worse!
1.0,"It is very cheaply made and the ""Rose Gold"" is a pink dip that looks cheap and childish. The stones appear as though they will fall out anytime and the pimk is bubbling already so sure to tarnish my finger. Not even worth the 7.00!"
1.0,Like the print but is too sheer and not properly made
1.0,"BOTH of them split at the thumb.  One of them split the second I took them out of the package to try them on.  I did a quick hand stitch to make them wearable.  The other split open mid outing & I don't have large hands.  No way they were stretched too far or anything. The fingers are very long - but I chalk that up to not having large hands - my problem.  Overall, disappointed with the quality."
1.0,Material not what I  expected.
1.0,"There was only one pair.  The glasses are okay, but the left lens is slightly off.  Disappointed."
1.0,"The first time that I washed, the color changed...looks like old...so disappointed..."
1.0,Poor quality material.  Was badly made which made the fit and hang terrible.  Returned.
1.0,Loved the band but after 30 days the outer shell separated and it fell apart ☹️
1.0,My goodness. This was NOT for a kid. It was not a Frederick Douglass look either. Just get search for “old man hair and bread” and there is a great one online that’s cheaper and looks more like Frederick Douglass.
1.0,Very cheap material and 2x fits more like a medium to large.
1.0,They did not keep my hands warm
1.0,"For what I paid for this, I was expecting a better quality TShirt.  Highly disappointed!"
1.0,The product came with dirt marks on it!! I ordered for a birthday party and now I don't have a gift for the girl.
1.0,BROKE RIGHT WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE RAPPER
1.0,The hem in the sleeve came out before I ever I got a chance to wear this dress.  So disappointed as it is super cute but the quality is poor.
1.0,The shoes were adorable. Getting them on…a mission. My straps were defective
1.0,Broken made me not a happy camper
1.0,"As I am an elderly senior, I found the bag too large and cumbersome for me. I think a younger person might find it just right.  Jean M."
1.0,"They don’t have any hold,"
1.0,"Ordered the mustard yellow skirt with red flowers and received a dark blue,purple, and gold striped skirt which wasn't my taste. Would have been a great price if not for that."
1.0,Did not like this dress.  Fabric was too flimsy and thin.  Sent it back for refund
1.0,Cheap product. Stems too short for ear lobes and mine are just regular size. Plastic is bent on some. Will not buy again
1.0,"I ordered a 12/14 for my 7 year old and she barely squeezed into it. She’s normally a 10/12 so I bought what I thought would be a size up for growth, wow, was I wrong!"
1.0,Quality is good but the fitting is really weird.
1.0,Ordered a 4xl and they fit more like a xl there quality is awful to there thick werid fabric not at all what i was expecting
1.0,So small it could only fit around the wrist of a child.
1.0,Paint on them were stuck and some of the clips didn’t work
1.0,There were no rhinestones on it just silver paint?
1.0,Sizing on this product runs small.
1.0,These bras unfortunately did not meet my expectations. They are flimsy and offer no support to my breasts. I do not recommend them
1.0,"If could give no stars I would have, the glasses gave off glare and distortion, hurt my eyes"
1.0,I thought this was wood not plastic
1.0,Threw them in the trash. Seriously.
1.0,These bras are cheaply made and fit weird.  Not proper support. I returned.
1.0,Not Dark Blue. More Royal Blue
1.0,"Don’t waste your money!! This was the most unsafe mask I’ve ever seen! The zipper has wide gaps in the teeth-enough to let germs in or out. There is no nose wire so mask does not fit close to face. When held up to light it is fairly see through, which the CDC says is not a safe material. I returned it immediately!"
1.0,The hat was crushed the Tesla emblem was smeared cheap quality
1.0,NO LO RECOMIENDO  NO LLEGO EL COLOR  ELEGIDO  Y COMPRE  DOS  VECES  Y  LA DOS  FUE LA  MISMO  ERROR  COMPLETAMENTE  MAL
1.0,These are the worst sunglasses ever.  The lens falks out and they are foggy to look out.
1.0,Does not do what it says...I wear glasses got these because of advertising on anti fog... Still fogs..don't waste money
1.0,"These are the worst, cheapest leggings I have ever ordered on Amazon."
1.0,These were very cheap material . I would not recommend buying them.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5d80d31f1a78ec68644a8ef01f9f839e]] Stains
1.0,"These pants if you bend, it shows the fabric stretching. I work in a business enviroment and they look cheap and feel cheap. If you want to look professional avoid these."
1.0,I am usually very excited to scarletion bags. This being my fourth. This occasion was very disappointing. My first day with the bag and barely 2hours later the shoulder strap burst.
1.0,The y broke
1.0,they were horrible.  could not  get  them  on.  got the  largest  size  to  no  avail.
1.0,"Ordered this dress for a cool comfortable  maxi dress for summer. It arrived in a very different  color than pictured, much more blue and thr fabric was heavy, clingy and very non breathable...not good for a hot summer day, I returned it as it was not as described  in listing."
1.0,Had to return. Material too thin.
1.0,The material was very thin and it runs small. My daughter that is 5’4” and 115 pounds it fits her.
1.0,Great shoes - they extremely comfortable and stylish!<br />Great for everyday wear with jeans or dress up a bit with a dress.<br /><br />Update: I’ve only won these 3 times and the lining is unraveling. I would’ve returned but I’m out of the timing. Cheap shoe for the price I paid.
1.0,"The shoes were returned as they were not comfortable at all. I have purchased skecher flip flops for my son before that were really comfortable and expected the same, but these were not. Still like the brand but not these shoes."
1.0,Rip-off. The elastic keeps popping off the masks. Will not order again.
1.0,not what I expected. the material is cheap and I don't like the fit... the neck is also small
1.0,I ordered an extra large in men it felt like an extra large for boys instead
1.0,"Please don't waste your time or money on this! It literally disintegrated in the first wash. I knew it was cheap, but come on! It stank of vinegar and sizing and seems to be made of old material - or just old and nasty. It even got black powdered material on the rest of the clothes which have to be rewashed."
1.0,The socks broke right at the heels-the first time I wore them! So basically wore them once and then trash them...
1.0,These hurt and also come off easy. When I’ve pulled my hair up they have fallen off and I couldn’t find the back piece.
1.0,Make sure you buy 3 sizes larger!
1.0,I purchased these according to the size chart and they were way too big. Maybe 2 or 3 of me could fit in them!! Had to return
1.0,The size chart has been added just since I had attempted a return and never received a reply for return! Ordered<br />an extra large which was more like a youth extra large...
1.0,"Fabric fraying, all different sizes and fabrics. Bad quality."
1.0,"I am shocked at the poor, flimsy material from which this piece of luggage is made. I just don't know how else to express my disappointment but I certainly wouldn't expect it to survive being packed and carried in a car, let alone suffer the abuse likely to come its way from air line baggage handling. Horrible"
1.0,"I don’t normally write bad reviews, at all, but this came in the wrong size. It was much longer than the ordered mm, the stone size was bigger than what was ordered, and the worst part? There was crust on the jewelry (attached to the stone and bar) as if it had been worn, put back into the package, returned,  and then resold. Absolutely disgusting and unethical. Don’t purchase from this seller. Don’t risk wearing a piece of jewelry that someone may have already worn. I would’ve sent it back, but I do not want anyone else to receive this same product. Unbelievable."
1.0,I disliked the delivery date that was supposed to arrive 10-28-21 but arrived 11-1-21 plus the outfit had no tags & smells like someone’s cologne! I’m very disappointed 😢
1.0,The material feels very cheap. The length did not work for me. I am 5’3 and it hit right at my ankles. Too long for the style it’s supposed to be but a few inchces too short to be a full length pant. I returned it.
1.0,Super cheap looking.
1.0,"One of the holding bars came broken, I can literally see the spring .. it doesn't seem to fit how the picture says it .. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"these are way smaller than the size chart. if you are size 10 or more, even the largest size won't fit. :("
1.0,"DO not buy this product.  The zipper opens up and when wearing on wrist, the magnet clasp opens so phone is hanging open  along with any cards in slots.  Very bulky and very cheap feeling."
1.0,Jacket was ordered for size to be xl.  could not get the jacket closed around my chest. Way to small. Maybe it was labeled wrong.
1.0,This dress felt like I was wearing a garbage bag. I'm 5'4 and the medium was too short. Very shapeless and unflattering. I would wear this as a nightgown but that's it. It made me look 10 lbs heavier.
1.0,"I wear a Med or large<br />I ordered a xl and still too small<br />Pants fit - not shirt , shirt is way too small<br />Sized more like a small not xl"
1.0,"The material was very thin,"
1.0,"Not a good workout top - leaves sweat stains in fabric, and I’ve never had that happen with another top. (Didn’t even sweat much)"
1.0,The material  was too flimsy
1.0,Not made for women with longer torosos
1.0,"I ordered a large and they didn’t fit at all I couldn’t get them past my lower thighs, and they didn’t look nothing like the picture the cuts look like they didn’t care how they looked. So I say don’t order from this buyer you won’t get what you paid for"
1.0,"This watch is sized for a man. I bought it for my 90 year old mother since she wanted a easy to put on watch. It hung on her wrist. It hung on mine as well. I don't believe we are tiny women, this watch is just an enormous size. There is nothing more frustrating then having to turn the watch around to find the time.  If they made it in children's size I would probably buy it again. There is no way to make it smaller and the black paint? rubbed off after a while."
1.0,"I was really looking forward to getting these boots for my daughter. As soon as she saw the box, she screamed in excitement. The first thing I saw, however, was how destroyed the box was. It was shipped in a bag. Why wouldn’t it be shipped in a box to protect the shoe box? No big deal, it’s not like we ordered this for the box. We put on the boots and I go to tighten the shoelace and the plastic piece that holds the shoelaces together has been broken off on one of the boots. And I notice some kind of material on the faux fur that is sticky. Needless to say, will be returning this product. I’m very hesitant to order another but my daughter is disappointed that she no longer has her “annaelsa” boots."
1.0,"Items is very cheap looking, nothing like the picture looks like.  It very very thin, and not of good quality!"
1.0,If it arrived as pictured I would be 100% satisfied. But it looks like I got two parts from two different watch bands.
1.0,"Very disappointed.  Fit was too small, even using the guide.  The top snap buttons are loose and come apart easily.  I bought the dress in white, and it’s a bit sheer.  If you purchase it at least one size up (maybe two), it might seem less see-through and not so bare up at the shoulders.  Wish I had returned it in time."
1.0,"This cover is a work of art, and fits they fob like a glove! Unfortunately, it terribly limits the signal by far more than half of its normal range.<br /><br />It got so bad that it wouldn't start my car and almost left me stranded. Luckily I was able to start the car, but I thought it was the battery. After battery replacement, I still noticed limitations, so I tested without the cover and I was able to use the fob as normal."
1.0,Ordered two of these masks for my girls to be scarers in our haunted lane. However when I put batteries in both of the masks I was very dissapointed only one lit up and the other one did not.  I needed them for this weekend and that is why ordered them when I did to make sure that we had them in time. There would have not been enough time to return one and get another one in time. I was really excited for the girls to get to wear the maks lit up but that just did not happen.
1.0,"The fabric is cheap, thin and clingy.  Tried to return but seller won’t respond.  Runs small."
1.0,These are not real boots - more like dolls boots. Sadly I missed the return window - total waste of $.
1.0,"It brought the blonde out and did not deepen at all, and has lots of perfume in it."
1.0,Awful bras! Material is cheap as it gets and it is totally not flattering or comfortable. Worst Amazon purchase ever.
1.0,Terrible watch. Extremely hard to adjust. Feels really cheap. Do not buy this watch’s
1.0,"Made in china, inferior fit and quality"
1.0,"Very thin fabric, not warm at all. Plus the pocket seams were not sewn right & I have to sew them myself! Won’t buy again!"
1.0,Short. Don't be fooled by the pics.
1.0,"Fake gold, all im going to say... decent looking though"
1.0,Too large wanted 1X got 3X
1.0,Eye pieces fit well and they don't fog up.  The only negative that I have is the strap is slightly uncomfortable. Update: Already broken after 2 uses!
1.0,Cheap. Odor when opened. Not a nice fit.
1.0,I never received the Sapphire blue teardrop jewelry set...Not happy at all
1.0,Complete garbage. Broke the first time I wore them.
1.0,"What a joke. The picture on the Amazon page looks correct, but the actual product is a disaster. “Overwhelmed” is spelled “over whelmed”. Not a big deal, but it gets worse. “Remember” is spelled “rememer”, “daughter” is spelled “drachter”, and “crown” is spelled “crow”. It’s absurd and shameful. The ridiculous mistakes turn this from a touching gift into a farce and a gag gift. The makers should feel humiliated. For crying out loud, just use the picture on the freaking website.<br />This is a huge let down. An absolute waste of time, effort, and money."
1.0,"Was not impressed with the look,"
1.0,cheap and fall apart in no time
1.0,"I want to give this a good review because I was really excited about it, but mine came unsealed and leaking everywhere with a terrible smell."
1.0,JUNK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING. DOES NOT FIT OR WORK
1.0,Material not super stretchy. It fit extremely tight with a Large. And I usually wear Medium/Large.
1.0,Top to 🤏
1.0,"Product received was obviously used by someone else, full of greasy finger prints and scratches on lens, would not recommend this brand."
1.0,"Sucked, then returned"
1.0,When I first received these slippers they are very comfortable. However after less thsn a week they completely fell apart. I was very unhappy since I originally really liked them.
1.0,Stitching lasted a day. Ordered a size bigger and it fits like size smaller
1.0,I liked the swim suit bottoms but the top was way too small.  I usually wear a 36F/G so I ordered a XXL; didn't even some close to covering up by breasts.  The top does not offer any type of support so if that's what you need you should not buy this tankini.
1.0,"hat is very, very large. i have a small head but reviews told me it would fit a small head better. it does not. the brim in massive too. i am embarassed to wear it. only thing i really like is how the brim can be bent into a variety of positions"
1.0,The item didn't even come in the mail. I'm currently looking for a refund. Waste of money. I don't recommend it.
1.0,Poor quality.  Crappy piece of garbage. returned mine.
1.0,"The product I received were  not like the picture. The pic are bright and colorful, what I received are pale and several all almost the same. Do not buy!"
1.0,Totally disappointed because the dress looked cute on me and I got compliments but the 2nd time I wore it the zipper completely fell apart. Contacted seller before the listed amazon return date and the only offered a partial refund and weren’t very nice about it. Don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,Broke the day I put it on. Very pretty but breaks so easily that it isn't worth it. I'll be returning it.
1.0,"Looks good and eye catching but, it’s not what it looks like.<br />Very cheap looking, colors are very faded.<br />I tried to make it work with different shoes/boots but, theses are leggings you would were around the house or to bed.<br /><br />Make your own they would look better than these. Do not waste your money and do not get your hopes up."
1.0,The pants were way to short! Or maybe I’m just to talk
1.0,Very poorly made!
1.0,"Doesn't really look like the pic. To me it's not worth the money, even tho it was just $8 or so. Looks like kids jewelry. I'm probably going to end up wearing it as an anklet think...."
1.0,"This shirt is tiny! I ordered a medium and it fits like a xsmall. I really wish I would’ve sized up about 3 sizes. Shipping also took forever, definitely not worth the wait."
1.0,:(  Deceptive in the sizing descriptions. Disappointing.
1.0,order ex large woman got child size
1.0,Not a pretty pink at all if yu our an adult.
1.0,The fabric is see through ☹️
1.0,I just like the dress because she lied about being 4 ex it was a petite small
1.0,"This hat is paper in texture and I have been trying to reshape it.<br />It doesn't want to conform to the stylish look above, it is the strangest material."
1.0,"Cheap. Yeah it may be leather, buts its the thinnest leather I've ever seen, on top of a cardboard form. Returned."
1.0,"Too tight for upper arms.<br />Probably best fitted for a teenager, not an adult"
1.0,"The socks feel like good quality socks. However, they should all be the same length, not various lengths."
1.0,These boots were uncomfortable and looked cheap. Rubbed my shins and ran big.
1.0,Two pairs were completely destroyed upon arrival
1.0,"....And the pockets were too deep. Similar to another pair that I loved, that didnt have deep pockets, but also havent come unglued 9 months later."
1.0,"Cheaply made, would not reccomend"
1.0,The buttons are so loose they make all kinds of noise with the slightest movements
1.0,Just unboxed the item to blend. It didn’t work!! Really upset at this...
1.0,Sizes not posted. Were to small.
1.0,"They just didn't look like in the picture. I think these are designed for kids. Both the arm and leg warmers were extremely short and didn't stretch much. For reference, I'm 5'7"" and weight 115 pounds, and these didn't even reach my knees or elbows. Also, I thought they were gonna come with a red or reddish pair, but turns out it was a bright pink.<br />Lastly, in case you are wondering, they are not warm. They're just meant for costumes."
1.0,First time wearing the jacket it ripped st the arms when zipping up the jacket to wear it
1.0,Turn colors right away do not purchase
1.0,So odd. The sides are odd and stick out. It does not fit as shown on the model.
1.0,Worst hat ever it say its fits adults but it didnt even fit my 7 year old so pissed off i didnt even want to give it a star but it makes u
1.0,Too sheer.  Returned it.
1.0,Wore one time and the band separated from the part that slides into the side of the watch.
1.0,Eah
1.0,Way to short!!!!!
1.0,My daughter received this for Christmas and opened the present this morning. She washed it before trying to wear it and this happened. The fabric on those places just disintegrated. The powder was all over our other clothes. Will never buy from this seller again. My daughter was heartbroken.
1.0,Not original at all.
1.0,Rainbow no red
1.0,Would have rather had a curved barbell. Not as well made as I would’ve hoped.
1.0,Waisted money
1.0,Tarnishes first time you wear them. No wonder it’s so cheap. Don’t buy
1.0,Description stated brutes - no belt included with item. Zero stretch - size chart is way off. Will be returning.
1.0,"I bought this ring set for the chain-link ring, chain-link ring came to broken and deformed the rings were at first too small but most rings I could stretch out. I try to stretch up one ring and completely snapped in half I didn’t put a lot of force in it so this was a surprise. Some rings I could not stretch those rings cannot even fit around my pinky finger. Absolutely ridiculous. Horrible quality do not buy."
1.0,"Not true to size, Very Cheaply made. Bad fabric"
1.0,I wear a 9-91/2 these are so big i can't keep them on my feet. I'm sick of making trips to ups  to return items that are sized wrong or broken or not as described.
1.0,This dress is made awful.It doesn't close in the front so you can see crotch area.Dont waste your money!Not going to mail back.It would probably cost almost the amount of the dress.lol.
1.0,I bought these for my fiance for his birthday. I bought a set of 2. One of the skulls refused to clip in right and ended up lost before a full 24 hrs after putting them in. Now barely even a month later all of the finishing has come off the other skull. I really wish I hadn't of wasted the money now.
1.0,Bracelet broke within 5 minutes of my daughter wearing it.
1.0,See through too good but bottoms no
1.0,Earrings were defective and I returned them.
1.0,The actual hook wasn't long enough to hold it on ear there was barely any hook.
1.0,Awful. They would barely fit a toddler. The material almost feels like spun plastic. Don’t do it.
1.0,I installed batteries and plugged it in.  It did not work at all. I returned it.
1.0,These run very large. At least for me. Even being large they were nothing like  what the model in the picture has on. I had to return them unfortunately.
1.0,didn't like the look
1.0,It's see through. Don't buy and it's way to  small
1.0,"Was excited when these came3 in. they were long so we rolled up with cool looking cuffs and they fit quite well.  About 3 hours into wearing them, pulling up after the restroom, the entire seat ripped open.  Don't recommend."
1.0,Too tight for a Large and as I mentioned the crisscross in the back was not comfortable. I would have returned it but the packaging was thrown away.
1.0,"Love the design, hate that the chain is way too short...one star."
1.0,The inside lining starting peeling up within a week of purchase. Pay a little more and get something that won’t fall apart.
1.0,"It arrived broken,"
1.0,1st day wearing it my pocket ripped. So very cheaply made.
1.0,These are knock offs of another brand.. I bought these 2 years ago and I loved them. The length was Long and they fit well. I wanted to buy them again so I found them and bought them. Well i should have known they were knock offs because each pic is a different pair of pants just same colors. Im so mad when i got them because the length was shorter than capris on me and i even got a large when im a medium. I finally found the actual pants I ordered years ago but of course they are out of stock.. This product was horrible for someone who is tall.
1.0,Honestly couldn't imagine its not as picture
1.0,I bought these for my son to use while we were on vacation. I put them on his head on for the first time and he pulled them off and the clip on the back clasp snapped off. I am pretty disappointed. He never even got to try them out.
1.0,"Ordered the hat pictured but when I opened it, it was pink. Not for me. My daughter did decide to keep it. So not a total loss."
1.0,Completely bent and unwearable<br />Very obvious crookedness. Unable to bend it back
1.0,It's very hard to read and it stopped working not long after I bought it<br />Dissatisfied with this product
1.0,Gross. Completely distasteful. Zero form fit.
1.0,"I ordered the orange and sea foam blue. It was a dark orange and dark green. Disappointed, will be returning."
1.0,"Based on some of the reviews and the sizing chart, I decided to size up. I'm normally an XL/1X (size 16 dress) but I bought the XXL. I was literally swimming in the dress. The bust drooped down and was baggy and the sleeves kept slipping off my shoulders. The fabric was very pretty and felt very light and airy though. I would have exchanged it for a different size if the seller didn't demand that I pay return shipping.<br /><br />Even though the order was fulfilled by Amazon and it said it was free to return the dress, the seller says that, &#34;Only product(s) that say that they are eligible for Free Returns on the product detail page are eligible for Free Returns. Free Returns only applies to product(s) fulfilled by Amazon. It does not apply to the same product(s) fulfilled by other sellers. Your order is fulfilled by seller not Amazon. So it is not free return. May you can understand.&#34; I had to pay $6 to ship this back, which seems like a petty thing to get annoyed with but the only reason I bought this dress over another dress I found was because I thought I could exchange it / ship it back for free.<br /><br />Highly disappointed."
1.0,Does not look good in the front…
1.0,Phone holder spring broke on first stretch
1.0,"Based on the other reviews, I was looking forward to receiving the yellow earrings.  I got them today and they're hideous.  Big, chunky, thick, unpolished (like an uncut diamond looks like a bit like a rock...rough, dull, cloudy...until it's finished).  And the color?  These earrings are not yellow.  They're like a Gulden's mustard brownish gold.  Yuck!  I'm not even sure they're worth my time and effort to return them; they might go straight into the trash before I call it a day."
1.0,I sent these to my mom in Chicago and they're not fleece lined. She's keeping them but I paid $7 extra for fleece. What a rip off. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,broke in less than a week
1.0,"I love cheap waywafer sunglasses. They get the job done and typically look pretty good. You can sit on them or lose them or even break them out while hungover and it somehow works.<br /><br />These are so flimsy and ultra dime-store that they started breaking while wearing them on my face. Apparently the gravitational pull of the planet was just too much against the bridge of my nose and they became to crumble like shortbread.<br /><br />These are very, very, very low quality."
1.0,Terrible quality<br />Does not look like picture
1.0,It was too small yet too large. I'm also 32ddd so I guess it just wasnt made for me. I ordered a large and it just looked weird.
1.0,"Gang, I have several of these jumpers by various companies, but THIS company can't get the sizing right. Look at the shoulder strap length in the picture: it's 6"" long and this is an XXL. I usually wear a size 9 but I sized up to an XL because I wanted it to fit loosely,  then when it arrived the shoulder straps were 6"". I sent it back and bought the XXL, and these straps are also 6""! I AM SO BUMMED. What in the world? This one has to go back as well."
1.0,I hated it. It was cheap and very light. Not any sort of quality to it at all. The letter S was supposed to be all bling. It had some bling at the top is S and at the bottom of S. The rest was just very cheap and very thin metal. The small bling it had on it was so small it was hardly noticeable. I was very disappointed. I sent it back
1.0,I want to return this item
1.0,"Awful. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Fabric looked nothing like the photo, awfully made. Would return it if I could."
1.0,To pretty and perfect to be authentic
1.0,I thought it was a long shirt at first because it looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"its so thin that you could break it easily, it's nothing like the picture at all.<br /> just don't buy it, please."
1.0,Shoe was too small. Color off white. Returned. Disappointed.
1.0,they cling to yor body and make you sweat !
1.0,Lost fit bit five times on the first day wearing it
1.0,Very uncomfortable. No cushion at all. Left work each day feeling exhausted with sore feet and legs.
1.0,"So bummed, ordered just in time for vacation & they arrived with one of the lenses out of the frames. I was afraid I was going to break it trying to get it in...so having to return them."
1.0,"Deceptive description. Line is not included! I have only received a pair of handles, not the 2x65’ of 220lbs Dyneema line as mentioned a few times in the description. Although there is one small line that says handles only it is easy to miss and not part of the main title or the general description."
1.0,Did not last long stopped working within a few weeks
1.0,The leather looks nice but within 3 days the seams are unraveling and the edges appear frayed. Very disappointing for a rather costly item.
1.0,"i returned mine,, my hands were warmer without them on.. very stiff and uncomfortable.  They weren't for me"
1.0,"The face was scratch and the strap doesn't stay in place. Didn't send  it back as waited for ever for it to arrive, I just like the rose color."
1.0,"Not good material, size too big<br />I have learned that never buy any glass online, i have to try"
1.0,"I am sorry to say, they broke right away :( cant return them since I took off tags and threw away the box :("
1.0,I've bought a different brand a few months ago and really liked them. I wanted to buy more thinking they were all the same quality. These were slightly cheaper but unfortunately the magnets are just way too weak to hold them in place. The slightest movement made them fall out instantly. Spend a few bucks more and get a stronger brand!
1.0,Tarnished in 3 weeks.  Website description is a lie saying that it will not tarnish! It does! Stay away. Soooo disappointed & embarrassed as this was a gift that I got for someone.
1.0,Broken already
1.0,This item is horrible!  The breast area has a very tiny cup. Maybe just maybe a chickens egg can fit the cup size. Too bad because the suit is cute.<br />Seller never responded so I did not get my money back.
1.0,"I am constantly searching for really long, plus size tank tops. I thought that I hit the jackpot when I ordered this, but was very disappointed to find that it is made from some kind of scratchy artificial fiber. I was expecting cotton, or a stretchy cotton blend. It didn’t feel good on. I would return it, but I already threw away the packaging, and wore it."
1.0,Cheaply made.  Inside ties broke off first wear.  Returned.
1.0,Sizing is way off. XXL fits more like a Large.
1.0,"I think its ridiculous to pay this much money for 1, yes 1 pair of socks!!! They are totally NOT WORTH it, believe me!!!"
1.0,Ordered the wrong size. Also the pant is improportionately big. Although loved the cartoon but returned it.
1.0,The inseam rides up way too far and cuts you in half.
1.0,"I own this belt in several colors, and they are all very fashionable and I receive compliments when I wear them, but this BLUE colored belt smells poisonous!  I have ordered this belt twice hoping that the first one I ordered was just a fluke and that some toxic smelling powdered had been spilled on the belt.  Nope.  The second one smelled just as bad.  I returned the first belt to Amazon, but the second one just ended up in the trash.  The blue belt arrives covered in some kind of toxic smelling powder.  It made my ENTIRE garage smell terrible and was giving my family headaches!  I order the two blue belts about a month apart, and placed my order for the second belt before returning the first belt, so I know Amazon did not just resend me the same smelly belt."
1.0,Does not glow in low light and terrible band clasp. Don't buy.
1.0,Poor quality. Item not close to description. Poor customer service from seller. Not typical Amazon experience.  Buyer beware!
1.0,Got this watch as as present because i adored it and pivked it out online (royal blue). So dissapointed it doesnt work. Was gonna try to change the battery but cant figure out how. This watch sucks.
1.0,"Thick, not just big. Came broken. At least they seem light weight so IF they arrive in tact, they won't kill your ears."
1.0,"They would fit better, on a square topped head!  They are not ""rounded"" on the top seam."
1.0,They change color after you dip them in the water like directions say. They are super uncomfortable.
1.0,The shoes fit and they are cute. However the color is not what it appears it’s much darker
1.0,"Cheap, feels like vinyl"
1.0,Not as pictured. It's much shorter and looks even cheaper than it was.
1.0,"Cheap made, super tight around the arms, see through. Ordered for my maternity pics and now looking for a new one :/"
1.0,Poor product. Image on the masks are of poor quality and doesn't look like photos. looks like a poor screen printed image that is blurry. Shipping took too long as well
1.0,"Returned, did not like."
1.0,Cheap and see through. I would have sent it back but after paying shipping I would only save a dollar.<br />I might be able to wear it as a swimsuit cover.<br />Cheap. Horribly made<br />Save your money!
1.0,Horrible!! Feels horrible looks horrible! Never again
1.0,"The cut and color are nothing like the picture in the ad. The holes for the shoulders to come through are extremely small. About the color... it’s a lime green. Not like the darker green in the ad...either. Like the other 1 star review, it took a month to get it. Not a deal breaker for a good sale price and not needing it right away, but the end results is very disappointing."
1.0,"Not for women who wear a size 10 or above. They are from a Chinese company, and at 5'11 size 10, I am far from overweight and not plus sized, but the xtra large cuts into my hips, only covers 3/4 of my butt crack, and just doesn't work. If you are under size 10 they may fit but order 2 sizes up from your normal size. Also, the cotton piece that is sewn into the crotch area is in the wrong place and would only be absorbent and breathable for your rear end area."
1.0,"I hated that the frames have prints of stars, etc. on them and would never have ordered them if I had known."
1.0,I ordered two hoodies from you and the first one I got right away and I love it..the second one in different color came three weeks later and was different material and way to big (even tho they were same same size )…I didn’t like it at all!
1.0,Not stainless steel it's turning me green and not what I paid for!
1.0,will not order again. i'm actually scrambling to find something to replace it. i used it for less than a week and the seam down the center ripped. fabric is so thin i can see through it. there is no lining
1.0,Way too small!  It is one size fits all......only if you are a XS.  I am a medium and it would barely reach around me.
1.0,"I really wanted to like these. The wooden stick broke within an hour. I couldn't get it through to my ear lobe. It ended up snapping. I'm really annoyed. The space between the ends of the wooden circle is too narrow for my earlobe to be comfortable anyway. They're nice in theory, not in use."
1.0,"The headband was meant for Halloween, but was late. When it arrived, it looked nothing like the one I ordered."
1.0,Theses bras are Uncomfortable.
1.0,"I ordered this in a large as I am normally a medium, but it was still very small. Also it looks nothing like the picture. In my own thoughts I thought that this looked like a bathing suite for someone that wanted to look like they were wearing a prison suite."
1.0,"These are bad. Like, a 16 year old “artsy” student’s first sewing project bad. They are very see through, the rise on them was past my ribs, and they’re so long they would’ve needed to be hemmed 3-5 inches. Wouldn’t recommend, especially for the price."
1.0,Got xs<br />Color was not ok lighter than expected<br />Fit was as expected but way too short but thats fine for summer<br /><br />but the quality of fabric was a little disappointing its rough on skin and very thin that you need to wear someting inside so it kinde defeats the purpose of getting a dress for summer but the design is fine but too short<br />And maybe lighter pink is better since u will be wearing something inside anyway<br />I wanted the darker one thinking for me no need to wear something inside but there dark yellow was lighter and dull than expected<br /><br />This is for a 5'0 petite shape woman but still way to short this is a really mini dress but can handle it
1.0,The quality of the fabric and the colour was not what was the same as description.
1.0,WAY too small.  Can't get them on my feet and I'm used to putting on compression socks.
1.0,It was a plastic ring not metal. Broke after a few days of wearing it
1.0,They say -30f but I worked in -20f at my work and my hands would numb up in about 20 mins of being in their. Pointless gloves
1.0,"This item does not protect you from car exhaust fumes. It is advertised that it does. I purchased it and tested it and after 15 short minutes, you'll feel nausea. Amazon needs to inspect these claims because someone could potentially die if they aren't careful!"
1.0,smaller then advertised
1.0,Quality is what you pay for....and it's not much.  Not sure if I will wear it or not.
1.0,"I ordered one of each of the arrow head necklaces and choked when I tried to put it on...<br />chain way to small, gave them to kids....."
1.0,This sweatshirt shrunk at least 2 sizes. Do not recommend!
1.0,I purchased an extra-large and it didn't fit my size 3 daughter!
1.0,Bought for my son to take to Japan. They were not true to size...they ran small....this was the 2nd fail at an attempt to find him a dress belt for his trip. To this day we still have no idea what belt should have been with the instructions that were sent..sadly a big fail.. Haven't had time to figure out how to return them since I haven't deal with this problem before and the fact I have been very ill...Assuming it's past time for a return so earing the cost on these belts however if they would have fit I did feel the quality was good and they were very nice belts the fit and instructions were the only issues
1.0,Doesn’t stay clipped.
1.0,"We were disappointed. This looked so cheap. The bar was so big and the chains were cheap. Very, very disappointed."
1.0,Cannot get the writing off even with nail polish remover.
1.0,Never buy this brand of watch. Cheap junk.
1.0,I love the color but it is very cheaply made. I wore it for about 5 minutes and it broke.
1.0,"Item is suppposed to be a large does not fit, way way too small. Aafter washing, item shrunk to the size of a five foot tall 100lb person."
1.0,Not cool man. XXL for children maybe. You embarrassed me. I have to live with this thing now.
1.0,Perfect if you’re a size 1 & 100 lbs.  way too small for me 150 lbs size 12.
1.0,I put them in my ear and wore them for 15 mins and the back broke right off of it! I love loved these and was so excited and then the back just snapped😭...disappointed at the low quality.
1.0,"So terrible. I am 5’10 which may have partially contributed tto the problem- but this dress - in white- is a cheap, Lycra, see through, long t shirt. It was the most terrible quality and fit and looked absolutely nothing as depicted. Don’t make the mistake!"
1.0,returned because strap is to flimsy
1.0,Too big and not flattering.
1.0,Basically children's size and thin won't waste money again
1.0,Upside down pattern
1.0,"I did not like these shorts.  The padding was too hard in the front, and it felt like the legs would continually creep up.  I sent them back."
1.0,I exchanged it twice and the sizes were still too small. The sizing chart provided was incorrect. The jacket also never came with the belt. Highly dissatisfied.
1.0,"The sizing was off, too small. Found out too late to return."
1.0,Not as expected.  They look rediculous and that is the BEST thing I can say about them.
1.0,"I'm 5'6"", so I usually do not have this type of trouble. It was a big disappointment and I quickly returned. Color described as green but background was black. Disappointed because other than that, the fabric felt good."
1.0,It shows full length but it only reaches the knees. Amazing considering I’m short.
1.0,Not for plus size women like it says
1.0,Broke the first time I used them.
1.0,"Not only did this take a long time to arrive (shipped from China), but the pattern is not the same as in the image. The dala horses are there, but they're very large and don't look like horses when I wear this as a scarf (the whole point of getting a scarf)--it's a floral pattern instead. If I DID use is as a wrap, the horses always look upside down. Beyond all that the fabric is SUPER shiny and slippery. Looks cheap and feels cold on the skin. Very disappointing. I'm learning my lesson about ordering cheap junk from China."
1.0,Worst fitting sweats ever! Tight in hips and legs and baggy in stomach area! Awkward for sure!
1.0,Has very cheep look. Not what you see
1.0,Stretched WAY out almost immediately. I wear size 9 but if I get these again I'll have to get an 8.
1.0,Horrible quality. So I comfortable I won't use it
1.0,The arm strap torn
1.0,"I’m a size 6 but with 34ddd, and this gave me no support and was way too small for my chest. I had to return it."
1.0,"The skirt only has one layer of tulle. The picture makes it seem thicker. And it's more pencil shaped than bell shaped. It's completely see through. The color is more grey than dusty blue. Overall, this was a horrible purchase."
1.0,Product did not seem to work in cold weather and fog on glasses.
1.0,I'm very glad this is no longer available.<br />It is STILL scratchy!<br />It's been a year since I bought this.  It has been washed and dried many times in several modes. With at least 3 different types of fabric softeners.<br />It's STILL scratchy!<br /><br />If I knew someone with rhino like thick skin I'd gift it. Looks just as new out of the bag. Did I mention... it's still scratchy?
1.0,"This skirt is orange, not red!"
1.0,Fell out on first use.
1.0,Cheap....they won't last long. Shipping was on time though.
1.0,Liked the design but the quality of the product was poor and fell apart the first use with seam breaking and needing re-sewing
1.0,The links quickly broke and I had no recourse for either replacement or refund.
1.0,Very low quality.  Not meant to be worn anywhere.  They rip at the slightest touch
1.0,Returned because they roll down!
1.0,Stitching came apart as soon as I tried it on.
1.0,"From the picture on-line, I didn't know this was the Nets team.  Being a grandmother and unfamiliar with basketball socks, I ordered three pair for my soon to be 17 year old grandson - all wrong players and teams.  A total waste of my hard earned money!  No refund granted by birthday time..."
1.0,they were broke and poorly made
1.0,"Quality control must really be hurting for this company. It was very unfortunate that these arrived and one of the cuff links were broken. The knot had broken off and evidently, the joint is designed very poorly and there was barely any contact point for the weld."
1.0,Isn’t strong ! If I use garbage bag is better
1.0,Light weight<br />And short<br />.
1.0,They quit working after a week. Their junk. Dont waste your money.
1.0,they weren't strong enough and can't be ordered stronger.  Also they can't be returned so they are totally useless to me
1.0,When trying to put the charms get broke in half the big link after finally added to my shoe hot broken when I was walking! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ They are cute but to fragile m. I don’t recommend this!
1.0,"Hate it.  Wide straps/wide back, high- thigh cut, so it makes my waist look even shorter.  Very low cut at top.  Cannot wear without being obscene.  It's definitely not the right fit for anyone with larger than C cup boobs.  I'm a 36DDD, and it feels like I'm trying to pt on a toddler's onesie."
1.0,Not at all what is appeared to be. Chain is extremely thin.
1.0,came and was bent out of shape and couple of area of the chain was broke
1.0,"The nose pads are too small to fit over the bracket of Maui Jim Red Sands MJ432<br />In the photos the small pads are the replacements I was sent, they do not fit."
1.0,Poorly made.  Fits infants not toddlers
1.0,"Very cute! It showed a little more chest than I was hoping it would, but really the problem was after the first time that I washed it. Afterwards, the material on the back just sort of turned partially white and looked like it had been worn through. It was incredibly disappointing."
1.0,"I wore one bracelet for like 4 days. But removed it to bathe. Didn't matter, it still turned dull and ugly. Sent them all back."
1.0,Really cheap... 'weathering' looks spray painted.
1.0,Broke before I even made it out of the house.  Guess I can be thankful it happened there than at the event.
1.0,"Horrible look and fit! I purchased these just for fun to where as pj bottoms around the house, they are so ugly that I will never where them! They do not look like they do in the picture. Seriously not worth the money."
1.0,It’s completely see through I don’t mind but I wouldn’t wear it again it’s kind of a funky material
1.0,Came super quick but doesnt fit like its supposed to.
1.0,Cheaply made sadly a lot of the stitches were coming loose and strings were hanging off of it straight out of the bag I hadn't even tried it on :( it was a Christmas gift and I was so excited about it! Disappointed
1.0,"I ordered a Youth Short Sleeve, Youth Large.. It’s my sons birthday and I got this item for him to wear to a game on 12/15/19. Bucs vs Lions at Detroit.  To make him happy I had to buy a T-Shirt at the game today for 35$... The tickets cost $300 + Parking 30$ + Fuel $45.  Highly disappointed, as I thought it was a great shirt for him to standout in the end zone as an away fan"
1.0,To small had to give it to my sister's granddaughter
1.0,Bracelet turned goldish and both the charms have fallen off and are lost.
1.0,I will never buy thing product again. Just don't buy . Go buy a different one or just go buy a pair of socks. Can't go wrong there. Rite.
1.0,"I replaced the pins many times only to have them fall out again, almost lost the watch. Leather was stiff and did not lay comfortably against my wrist."
1.0,It was very white it was very cheap and I think after the first wash it would shrink to the size of a in xxx small and I take an XL. I am upset on the hoodie they ranged from $30-$60 when I went to buy it again .
1.0,"Material was cheap stuff, scratchy polyester not soft t-shirt material as some reviews claim and the color was inconsistent within the fabric. The stitch work was uneven  and clunky. Fit was fine, I am usually a large and I got the l-xl also that was the only thing that was right about this product. Personally I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1.0,"The sizing chart is either incorrect of these dresses run large. The one that arrived was way too big in all the wrong places. It is also too long. The material is just ok. It is thick with renders it a better dress to wear in the winter but with no sleeves I don't see how that is possible. If this dress were smaller and looked better on, I'm sure I would give it more stars."
1.0,I did not purchase this bracelet.  I looked up the definition of PU (polyurethane) leather...<br />Synthetic Leather is a man made material that will represent the look and feel of Genuine Leather but in fact is NOT.
1.0,This material is soft and love the color but not long enough I’m short so this was too short I was expecting it to cover at least half my butt so up to preference I didn’t like it!
1.0,Would like to return
1.0,"Stones won't stay in the wire hold long enough to even wear once.  I bought two pair, one for me and one as a gift... both are unwearable."
1.0,"I wear a 2x/3x but I ordered a 4x assuming this shirt would be large and loose for Vegas weather.  Shirt was so short it didnt even come down to my belt.  Its probably 5x in size width, but only XL in length.  Terrible.  I already gave it to goodwill."
1.0,tarnishes and broke my skin out
1.0,"Doesn't look like the pictures, it's run small. Very small and I'm not tall, im 5.3 and around 130lb and I can't even close it around my body.  The pattern its cut, very bad cut on this one. I returned it and asked for my refund.  In the pics look cute but un real life baaaad."
1.0,awful and you can see through the material
1.0,Material too flimsy
1.0,I ordered the swisher sweet socks.  The printing is not good at all there are streaks in the ink as if the printer was running out of dye and when you put the socks on and the material streched the printing was so shallow it looked like a years old faded sock. Not anywhere worth $12.99
1.0,I wore these with snow boots in Michigan after a few inches of snow came down and temps were around 25-30 degrees...my toes still froze.
1.0,Fits any to small. Ordered a size larger and it still didn't fit.  Supposed to be plus size!
1.0,"Skimpy.  I am slim, 5’8 of medium build but these leg warmers were not comfortable.  They felt cheap and didn’t fit.<br />I would not recommend them.  The leg warmers I used to have were soft, generous, long, and cozy.  These don’t compare."
1.0,Don't stay up
1.0,"Bought this a while back to wear when I didn't want to wear a gold ring.  Didn't expect a whole lot for the price, but didn't expect it to turn copper-colored either. If this is stainless, I have a full head of hair. Bottom line - you get what you pay for!"
1.0,"It's pretty. It's soft. It's also VERY small. There's no way that it's anywhere near 75"" long. On the model, it shows the length hitting her at mid thigh. This thing will cover your shoulders and that's it. It also took longer to get here than it should have considered it's a Prime item. I needed it for a gift tomorrow. It's going back. Huge disappointment. Do yourself a favor and learn from my mistake. Buy something else."
1.0,These are going back.  I received for D rings and only managed to open one of the screws.  They are so tight that they cannot be removed.  I had to stop after my philips screw driver got messed up.  The least they could have done is loosed the screw a bit for you before mailing them to you.
1.0,"Way to lose to fit on my head. They fall off constantly, the &#34;arms&#34; are really lose had to tighten them"
1.0,please dont buy this! horrible for any of the uses claimed... especially if your looking for mask wear .. wasted money
1.0,"I bought this for my husband for our anniversary, and even spent extra having it engraved. It died after 2 weeks. I'm highly disappointed."
1.0,This watch is just too complicated and difficult to understand. The instructions aren’t clear and pressing one button seems to reset every alarm.
1.0,Too heavy and couldn't see with them.
1.0,"Disappointing buy, looks not like picture, it shows purple but the one I had sent to me is blue...not what I expected...."
1.0,The item said children's slippers and apparently they're not they are adults slippers in that wooden an extra large and my granddaughter is only 9 so of course you wouldn't fit him
1.0,It looks pretty in the pic but it looks a little cheap.  Most importantly- the metal star embellishments are not flat on the inside where it hugs your skin. When I took it off after wearing all day I had stars imprinted in my skin pretty deeply- and it was extremely uncomfortable to wear. If you like your watch to fit snug as it should to monitor your body- I say a big fat no.
1.0,Chip quality
1.0,"Ordered 3 different sizes to get a good fit as they were so big, then the bow fell off within ONE DAY of my daughter wearing them. It's just glued on, it should be stitched"
1.0,"Stuck this baby in my nose, and the post was bent in the opposite direction as the picture shows, so it was super uncomfortable. Wore it anyway, barely touched my nose and a whole stone fell out. It's cute, but definitely not worth the hassle."
1.0,I bought them last year and was a little confused when they came in the mail and the bead on the black band was blue with two white stripes and i thought that maybe i just looked at the picture wrong and then today it cycled back in my “reorder” suggestions which i thought was actually perfect because my boyfriend just broke his while we were camping. Looking at the picture now i can see that they sent me the totally wrong bracelet
1.0,horrible fit & MATERIAL.
1.0,"I’d give this 0 stars if I could. Came crumpled in the bottom of a bag, deodorant stains in the armpits & reeking of perfume (almost gagged when I opened the bag). Immediately returned."
1.0,I'm not happy at all. The material is very scratchy against the skin and the shirt runs much smaller than the pants. A total waste of money.
1.0,This was a size 3XL and it was very tight.  I usually wear a size XL and I ended up sending it back due to it being so tight.
1.0,I wore this for one day and the clear crystal has fallen out of the metal part
1.0,too thin and cheap
1.0,Very cute but way too small.  Disappointed plan to pass them on to a friend!
1.0,"Ordered these after many people recommended and they fit great and felt great, but they got a hole in the seam on the first west. Pretty disappointed"
1.0,Very thin material. Definitely not for women that have breast. You'll need to size up by 2.
1.0,it broke after wearing it once!
1.0,It was cheap plastic and arrived broken in half I was supposed to send it back but I travel way too much to do that. So I just threw it out they also didn’t give refund unless I sent it back .
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on
1.0,Does not look like the picture it's ugly in person
1.0,[[VIDEOID:88d49890c60bf2419b5b92205f7a99b3]] This item doesn’t fit my Apple Watch SE.  it doesn’t lock in snug and can just fall out if pulled slightly.
1.0,poor quality....product appearance does not maintain its look as in shine or smoothness
1.0,These are cute and lightweight with a faux pearl. They don't come with earring backs. I bought a second pair for a gift and the pearl was broken off so I snapped the pearl off the matching earring. I assume you get what you pay for.
1.0,So much slippery fabric it was impossible to wear and was not at all flattering.
1.0,Very poor quality.  Should not have bought these.
1.0,This was huge in the waist and super small in the hip. I returned. I’m 5’8 and wear a 12. I ordered xm just to be safe. It didn’t fit
1.0,The shoes arrived wet with mold on them.
1.0,"I got these, barely a week later they are wearing out.. color is almost rose now, I got gold plated.. didnt wear to bed or in shower.."
1.0,Nothing like what is photographed.  Fabric is floppy and not structured.  Looks like a bad lampshade.  Don't buy it.
1.0,"The fit.  Heels,  toes,  and side of feet hurt the entire time that I wore them.  So disappointed as I have worn gdfyers for many years with no issues at all... Long distance walking and no pain at all. I wish that they worked well for me."
1.0,"Vehemently dissatisfied. Not at all sized the way it should be. I ordered the 5xl because I wanted it looser on me and there's less than 1 foot of fabric between each arm hole in the back, so if you have the worlds smallest shoulders, this is the jacket for you. I will be returning this first thing in the morning."
1.0,"I purchased one of these watches for my husband for our Anniversary. Two months later, the watch won't keep correct time even after switching out batteries, but because I'm out of the 30-day return window, I'm out $180. I've written to their returns email to see if I could just get an exchange. Until I get a response, I'd suggest you don't waste your money."
1.0,Wish I could give 0 stars. Worst piece of junk I’ve ever ordered. Broke twice within 5 minutes of trying to put it on. When I finally was able to use it my two necklaces were tangled all day. Worthless garbage do not waste your time or money.
1.0,"Itchy. Terriblene fit. I will not purchase anything from here again. The color is not as shown in the picture. In person it looks orange, not gold."
1.0,You can see sweat when you workout in these...
1.0,One out of the four shirts that came was broken at the strap
1.0,beautiful bracelet but it's broken already just after the return window closed!
1.0,Cheaply made don't last more than a week
1.0,The quality is not good!
1.0,"I bought this (admittedly cheap) watch for a specific function where this level/quality of watch should be used - inside my life jacket when I paddleboard so I know what time it is (I saw in the reviews the compass was crap so I didn't buy it for that). It fit the bill but didn't even last a single season before it died. Cheap is one thing, but non-functional is another."
1.0,"Bebe leggings fit great when the size is true to chart. However, lately they seem to label their clothing by chance. I have Mediums that fit like Large and Large that fits like Medium. My last purchase was a Large that fit like a Small - that was when I decided I'd rather purchase them in person. The worst thing is that even if you notify their team, they really don't care - they're killing their own brand."
1.0,it runs very small
1.0,I really wanted to love this dress. Sadly the sizing is all wrong.
1.0,"Cute but they don’t look rose gold at all, They are pink. I wore them to work and about 2 hrs in my ears were burning, I took them out and pus  was coming out of my holes. A day later and they still hurt and are very red. I’m not one who normally has a reaction to any metals in my ears"
1.0,Definitely not like the picture shows. Be aware that it’s not a sweater. It’s more like a thin pullover long sleeved shirt. Very misleading by the seller. The print matches the pic. But this isn’t what I paid for. It’ll do...but it’s not okay.
1.0,"The color isn’t KHAKI, it’s really CREAM almost white. The materials feel very plastic and very little fabric used if any."
1.0,"It is too small to be a necklace, too big to be a bracelet, it broke the first day. YUCK!!"
1.0,They are not true to size I order a 2x and I wish I would have never did it the jeans didn’t come up my legs at all. These are not plus size jean at all.
1.0,I was so excited for these but they didn't stay at all.
1.0,Same exact bag and brand for half the price at Target!
1.0,The belt looks good.  I got around to transferring my cash from old belt and found that the zipper on this one does not close when it is zipped closed.  It stays unzipped no matter which way I move the zipper tab.
1.0,Weird skirt.I hate it. It doesn't match with anything
1.0,So small. Made for a 3 year old. I was so disappointed
1.0,"I wanted this to fit, it's so cute!  but ordered 3xl and it fits like a medium!  So disappointed!"
1.0,It didn’t do as promised. That was the reason we returned it.
1.0,Belt broke in half after one week of daily use.
1.0,Broke in less then a month.
1.0,"Mala calidad, se veían muy ordinarios, no cumple con las expectativas, los retorne."
1.0,Watch did not work upon delivery. Bad battery or just doesn’t work!
1.0,Junk. These shoes are basically flip flops as the rear heel support is nonexistant.
1.0,The lens is too slim. It rattles when you install the lens in your oakley 2.0 frame. The first one I ordered  is from Saucer and it does not fit correctly. Make sure you can return the item free of charge.
1.0,Could not wear so I donated it because it was my correct size but it was too big to fit me
1.0,"Don't buy this. The clasp is only glued in place, not stitched, so the first time you put it on your wrist the clasp pulls out from the band, making the watch band inoperable."
1.0,No fit in zte max pro from metro pcs is very short
1.0,The XL barely covers the nipples for 36C tatas - return
1.0,very bad quality is the worst thing I bought in Amazon
1.0,Cheaply made. Out of proportion pants vs top vs jacket. Altogether terrible and way overpriced
1.0,This dress was cheap didn't even take it  all the way out of the bag.
1.0,Bracelet was purchased as a gift. Only lasted a couple days and broke. And this was second bracelet purchased from NinaQueen. Two different bracelets and both broke in same way.
1.0,It looks more like a nightgown.
1.0,Baggy Pants Not Cute!
1.0,2nd pair of goodr. This pair fogs something fierce.  1st pair i bought are awesome.
1.0,"Flimsy, bent easy, annoying sound just by carrying it"
1.0,The shirt is cropped and doesn’t look that way in the pictures but it definitely is.
1.0,"Very disappointed, did not come with us instructions nor an extra battery. The bad news is...it won't even turn at all. If it would just work I'd give 5, but till then...awful waste of money"
1.0,Not happy the item broke in a week  time.Very<br />Dissatisfied...
1.0,"The bracelet I received doesn't come close to matching the picture provided by seller. It matches a picture posted by a previous reviewer.  Upon reading the description provided by the seller closely, it describes the one I received, not what is pictured.  I returned it."
1.0,But very cheap looking.
1.0,The quality wasn’t great.
1.0,Wore them for less than a week and they’re already tarnished. Bad quality.
1.0,"Well it fits but I ordered up in size I purchased the 4x because I wanted to have room. It didn't give as much room as I wanted but it worked I'm normally a large. The jacket has gaps in it, you could see the faux leather which made it look cheap. I have this same jacket in all white and it's perfect,  I have no idea what happened with this but, I will be returning. I'm disappointed."
1.0,I received my dress today!! It's super thin and you can see completely through it!! It doesn't have any pockets like the picture and it does run small!!
1.0,"My granddaughters earned money doing chores & purchased these masks.  We probably should have read more about them but they expected hard masks.  These are very flimsy, stinky rubber.  The painting was bad too...very disappointing."
1.0,"I’d like to start this review by saying that the overall cuteness of this jewelry was awesome! I couldn’t wait to get in my ear. However, my problem came into play with quality. The adorable little lizard in the middle of the bar is fixed into place. He won’t slide up and down like other jewelry I have. So my piercing was healing very nicely and I had no keloids at all until I tried to put this earring in. Because the lizard doesn’t slide, I was unable to pull my ear far enough to get the top section of the bar through and couldn’t push any farther down as the lizard was already jammed into the bottom hole. I tried a bit too hard and unfortunately developed keloids on both the insides of the top and bottom holes of my industrial piercing. I am extremely unhappy about it. While it is not the sellers fault that I tried too hard to get the jewelry in, I still DO NOT recommend this jewelry!! Don’t buy anything where the gems or decoration in the middle is fixed because unless it was custom made for your ear or just fits your ear perfectly then you will have problems. If nothing else, please take the jewelry to a piercer you trust and ask them to put the jewelry in for you. They will know if it’s safe or not."
1.0,It didn't fit right first off but regardless even if it did the amount of 'boost' from the front ties is minimum. It made no difference it was more decorative than cleavage enhancing. Runs small but the shape isn't even flattering on a gal pal of mine who tried it on and was the correct size for it anyway. So it just wasn't a flattering piece.
1.0,It's really a necklace wound up!!  Disappointing!!
1.0,Not even fit my wife's glasses. No worth the trouble to send them back.
1.0,This top was not slim and the sleeves were way too long and around the wrists was really big!
1.0,Fabric and material not as expected
1.0,I ordered a medium and you could wrap a volkswagon with it
1.0,"I really wanted to love this dress I did. I purchased this dress for a funeral. After reading all the reviews decided to go for it. Only problem I had was my breast 40D at the moment didn't fit at all. This might be my fault as I just had twins a month ago but thought if I ordered the XXL it could work. Boy was I wrong, I'll have to give it a while before I try again with this dress, maybe for a better occasion."
1.0,Not at all what I was looking and not long enough
1.0,"The description clearly states that these are enamel pins, but they are actually plastic.  I am very disappointed and will be returning."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:ce9d89611658966d1b56a88eb9cb5298]] Looks like trash, like something from a home printer that you iron on"
1.0,"This watch is a complete waste of time and money. I got a brand-new, and the date and setting functions will not perform normally. I sold diamonds fine jewelry and fine watches for many years. This piece is worthless and is good for nothing but the trash I do have two other Invicta watches that he pretty good time but these two are a resounding disappointment you can read my review of the next one that I bought, but don't waste your time on this one. Go get a Timex Expedition if you're looking for an inexpensive but good timekeeper with a mineral crystal and normal water resistance. You won't find it here, save your money."
1.0,"El vestido que me enviaron no es el que yo compré, es un modelo diferente (manga al codo, no tiene hombro frío y el ruedo es irregular. Nunca lo hubiera comprado."
1.0,"Well, it's long.  I'm 5'4 and it would need a hem if i was going to keep it.  I like the material is soft and nice. (IT HAS POCKETS!), though if you're chubby in the middle, this isn't for you.  I look freaking pregnant again."
1.0,Fell apart when I opened it
1.0,This was a joke!! Anyone who wears a 2x should not even try this on. I Gave it to my small friend.
1.0,Fell apart as soon as I took it out of the package. Don’t buy!
1.0,The chain broke the 1st day i got it.
1.0,I gave 1 star because it looks like the shirt in the picture but a freakish version. .the front comes up to my bellybutton and the back is literally under my butt!! Ughhhhhhhh
1.0,"The dress is a pretty thin material, no slip underneath."
1.0,"They are tiny. Baby-sized in all directions. I laughed when I opened the box. I can put them on the end of my nose and bend the hinges out for a brief look through, if I cross my eyes. They do fit in a shirt pocket without sticking out, but they no fit this man. Don't think they'll fit my wife either.<br />For half the price I also bought the &#34;Eyekepper Spring Hinges Round Reading&#34; --much better.  Ordered a second pair."
1.0,"There is a hole in the pants, was not given any option for a replacement. I wear a medium and ordered a xl and it was tight in certain areas. I now do not have an outfit for an event."
1.0,Hate the color. Ordered tan and received an army brown.  Pants are tapered no straight leg.  Returning
1.0,"These are truly ultra soft and the perfect shade BUT these pants hoes do not last long! Very good for only one wear if that. The pants hoes tear very easily, even if you haven’t worn them and are trying to put them on. Very frustrating. I’ve spent so much money constantly ordering these same types just because they’re soft but at this point I might as well by expensive tights then continually throwing money away."
1.0,So to start off with the elastic in the waistband at a relaxed stage is only 20 inches. when stretched out it's stretches fully out to 48 inches. so unless you have a 20 inch waist it's gonna be pulling really tight on you and actually hurting to wear. then the quality of the material itself is incredibly cheap. it is a very thin material that tears very easily.  finally the look over all is just ugly. they just look terrible on I highly suggest nobody else buy these pants.
1.0,Received a dress with a broken zipper that's unwearable. No help offered when I wrote in about it. Huge waste of money.
1.0,"Ball of knots and I had so much trouble when I tried to style it, I went and found a better brand that holds up better. You can’t even run your fingers through the hair I’ve never seen a wig like this."
1.0,"Waaaay too big, my feet keep slipping out of them. Very disappointed."
1.0,It took over a month to arrive. This shirt fits horribly! It does not fall of the shoulder. It stays tight around the shoulders.. and it does not fit big like it looks on the pic.. I would not recommend.
1.0,The items was used before there was Scratches all over the crown
1.0,"I bought the double pack of these socks.  Opened bag 1st pair one has hole in it as shown in pic, right out of the packaging.  The other pair are way too big.  Hopefully shrink up some after washing."
1.0,"The size did not fit at all,however it was written that the size fit as expected more than 70%..i bought 2 sweatshirts and both of them me & my friend we will not use them cause of the unfit size..Actually it was upseting for me and my friend"
1.0,Way to smal
1.0,"Very cheap fit, not true to size, cheap material"
1.0,See through & poor quality
1.0,"Did not look as cute as the picture, super unflattering cut, and the zipper looked crooked. Not in a cute intentional way, like in the photo, but in the irregular discount bin kind of way. I returned and bought a simple hoodie instead."
1.0,I have a smaller head but these fit great. Unfortunately the lenses sound like they're popping out every time you open them.
1.0,"ugly in person, very thin, completely see-thru, do not order or maybe not in this light beige color."
1.0,"I don't like writing negative comments about products. But, these shirts run super small. I usually take a men's medium, which I ordered although these shirts looked like childtens sizes. The fabric was of a poor quality. The shirts collars width were super thin. I would not buy again from this vendor. As usual, Amazon's return service was superb. The 2 shirts were credited immediately."
1.0,We don't know if it fits for its a Christmas gift
1.0,I couldn’t wear this watch band because only 1 of the 2 parts to the band would attach to my Garmon Forerunner 645. The edge of the leather stuck out too far to insert the spring action pin into watch.<br /><br />The pins also were not springing back like normal. They had to be pushed both ways.<br /><br />I sent the band back and a new one is coming. Honestly I have little hope it will be any better.
1.0,Clunky and cheap looking. Not worth returning after waiting weeks for it to arrive.
1.0,No extra link so they don't hang right.
1.0,"I had a similar experience as the one described by reviewer J. Cutts &#34;jimmybro&#34; (see &#34;They don't work, and they aren't as described&#34; on February 3, 2012).  The finger lights I received weren't even in a bag.  They were stuffed in a too-small box and not sealed properly.  I couldn't believe all 40 were still in the box.  19 of the 40 worked.  However, of the 19, some lights were very dim and some required wiggling and/or pressure to light up (and then would stop shining once pressure was released).  21 would not work at all.  The final straw is that the description on Amazon reads:  &#34;Replaceable batteries: 3x AG3 cells per light, included!&#34;  First of all, the lights should just work when received.  I shouldn't have to spend additional money on batteries.  But, second, &#34;replaceable&#34; is a bit of a joke.  There is no convenient battery compartment with a screw to remove the cover.  I had to gently pry open the entire plastic casing, being careful not to break the plastic nor let any tiny pieces fall out.  I didn't actually replace the batteries (I don't have size AG3 just sitting around at home) but I imagine that it would be extremely difficult.  Just opening the toy to check out the possibility of replacing batteries and putting it back together was tricky enough.  The button switch and light bulb fall out very easily.  Don't plan to be able to use more than half of these unless you are willing to shell out extra dollars for batteries and test your fine motor skills in replacing those batteries."
1.0,"Too small, not for Western women.  Too short, more like a blouse."
1.0,Clip comes loose or pinches to hard. Kind of uncomfortable for long periods of time
1.0,"I love how soft it is, and I love how it looks but damn on any hot sunny day the sweat just get soaked right into the shirt. There is no where the shirt can breathe"
1.0,I did not like the pantyhose-like fabric. These are just ok. I wore them for compression after having surgery on my arm but bought them for sun protection while motorcycling.
1.0,Sized all wrong
1.0,pretty cheap glasses
1.0,The pants were way to small ... but at least the top was fine.
1.0,They suck
1.0,"The dress is very beautiful. However, the side zipper goes way too far up. It was impossible to continue zipping up without getting my underarm skin. Unless you have the longest torso ever!!!!! Don’t waste your time on this. The fabric was damaged as well when I received the dress. I had to return. The dress was somewhat heavy and looks really nice. But it was impossible to zip as high as they had it."
1.0,This is adorable but it was ordered as a present and it took WEEKS to get it. It never made it to the recepient because it took TOO long! I can not believe how long this took.
1.0,"I like rimless glasses and so succumbed to temptation.  They BROKE on the second wearing.  I did not carry them in my purse, but rather, left them by the bedside for nighttime reading.  I was wiping a lens clean and one of the arms came off.  Ridiculous."
1.0,The glasses look nice but broke before they were ever worn even once.
1.0,I ordered this in a medium because the white I ordered in a medium and that’s my size. The material is nothing the same as the white one. There is zero stretch to this tank so I ordered a large which came labeled as a large but was the exact same fit as the medium with zero stretch. Since then I have ordered another white a gray and a black and they are all true to size. The tie die not so much.
1.0,I am returning it. Looks cheap and smells like chemicals. I tried airing it out but the weird smell persists. Color not as nice as photo.
1.0,"I bought a pair of these sunglasses and they were just what I was looking for! Since plastic sunglasses are not very durable I purchased a second pair just in case they broke. The second pair I received had a big scratch or defect mark on one of the lenses. I received an email from the business owners asking how I felt about them and if I had any issues to respond directly to their email. I informed them of the scratch but almost 2 weeks later have still not heard a response, it is for these reasons why I am giving them one star, otherwise these glasses would have received a five star."
1.0,"Very thin, and tore when I put them on. Cheap looking, nothing like the photo."
1.0,Disappointing. The only thing that lights is the power buckle. The lace is just plastic.
1.0,The pictures are not as seeing the product  in person. I would like to return it.
1.0,"My son has been wearing these for a couple weeks, but not every day. The Velcro strap has torn off the shoe. Waste of money. Do not recommend."
1.0,Material cheap and poorly made.
1.0,Zipper came out on my first day of use...very poor quality.
1.0,Can’t use because is too large!
1.0,"I ordered these because they were cute for the price. Well what I received was no where near worth what I paid. My earrings came damaged and some completely broken. This is ridiculous, inexcusable, and I will NOT be ordering from this brand ever again. Terrible and shameful quality. Should not be priced the way it is. Total crap in my opinion and not worth paying a penny for. Save your money for something else."
1.0,Cracked and very very small..not worth the high price
1.0,These earrings are very cheap. My stud fell out the first day I wore them.
1.0,Necklace was broken when it arrived.
1.0,It's too thick for Easter it is mostly sweater type material and was sewn on the sides. I personally think it's too thick for a newborn will make them too hot.<br />The picture on the website is deceiving it's nothing like what you get. Regardless how other people posted pictures it is not as nice way to thick. In my opinion chunky material. The only thing cute was the Hat but I'm returning both. I will include a close up picture so you can see how thick  this sweater is. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this keep looking for something else.
1.0,Sadly I bought this super in advance of Father's day and wasn't in the return period.  The mechanism didn't work at all.
1.0,Was sent only the tops to the pajamas there were no bottoms.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Lenses were super foggy. Tried to clean them with lense cleaner and a cloth I have for my prescription glasses. Couldn't get them clear. Also way to wide. I typically wear men's sunglasses but these would have even been to wide for a head like George Lopez. Not impressed
1.0,Horrible quality shirt. Super thin material and the stripped parts are printed on. The fabric is poor quality and looks plastic.
1.0,Mine broke the moment I tried it on. I am very disappointed.
1.0,"It's itchy, not true to size and definitely not worth it. I can wear a normal XL just fine. This is not sized right."
1.0,It’s awful. Material is scratchy and it shaped like a box. I ordered a size up to ensure there was enough room but I honestly think I could have sized down. I sent it back and don’t plan to repurchase! The material itself is enough reason not to
1.0,"Not a good experience.....I was sent a pair of post-style earrings instead of these.  I cannot wear posts, because of the way my ears are pierced.  Sooooo, not too happy with this purchase."
1.0,"The material. It looks cheap, and when worn it gets too hot. I would not recommend buying this pant. Now this pant fits well just not high waisted. Also the zipper is in the back which gets uncomfortable. I personally would not buy again."
1.0,"pants were small, i usually am a medium but they did not fit like mediums"
1.0,"Bought these bands so I could have some different color options and, initially, I liked them. They are soft and comfortable and look just like the original band. I put the blue band on a few days ago for the first time and on the 3rd day of wear, I was grocery shopping and my Fitbit caught on the side of the shopping cart and the one strap came completely loose. I caught it and put it back on, thinking how lucky I was not to have lost/dropped my Fitbit and continued shopping. The next day I realized that the band was coming loose where the silicone is attached to the plastic connector. Doesn't seem like these are as durable as the original band and I will be throwing them all away now seeing as how I'm outside the return window. Definitely don't trust any of these to keep my $300 Fitbit on my wrist. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on these."
1.0,This blouse is poor material.<br />The stiching is poor.<br />The neck is awful.<br />Don't buy you will be returning  like I  am.
1.0,"I thought this at least had holes in it, but it didn’t."
1.0,T-shirt material...might fit an infant.
1.0,Ordered the XXL (2X) and it was way too small. TThe fabric was soft but thin. Order two sizes bigger than needed.
1.0,"These just didn’t work for me, but I have sensitive feet."
1.0,After only a week one of the bows broke through the rubber ear coverings<br /><br />Edit: after 2 months these have gotten worse. The lenses fall out while the wearer just walks with them on. I cannot recommend these. The seller contacted me and offered a $30 credit to remove my rating because they will use my feedback to improve the product but I cannot do that knowing how poorly made these are.
1.0,Did not get the hats that were in the picture. I got scammed returning asap. Be careful.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6a9697b3e86a4ae15f2ecafd73fbbb5c]] I loved the chains them selves but you are advertising a 2mm 27 inch snake chains  and send me 1.5mm chains then I did not realize that those chains were only 1 .5mm not 2mm so I hit the but again button and know they sent me three  1mm chains and it is incorrect I should be getting 2mm 27 inch chains 925 sterling this is avscam. MICHAEL STASEK
1.0,Way to light and don’t hang down right
1.0,Super small. My daughter might wear it as a bracelet.
1.0,"I ordered a medium, I am 5’4” 136 lbs. It fits great, but the colors are not anywhere near as flattering as the picture shows. See attached picture for true colors, make sure to click on it to see all the colors.  The material under the arms are not loose fitting as described in the picture either. It looks like a men’s shirt when I put it on."
1.0,Falls over at the first gust of wind
1.0,These bras are beautiful on!  Great vibrant colors.  My only probably is that within two days two different bra straps broke.
1.0,"NOT SURE, ITS ME"
1.0,The color not al all as shown and completely see through
1.0,Do NOT buy. This is an awful fit. The chest is down by the waste. Returning and they are charging me $6.00.
1.0,The quality was not there for the money I spent.  Would not buy this product again.  The lining or inside separated and has not stood up very well.
1.0,Very poor quality.  Several were broken.
1.0,Not at all like the picture or description. Sent back
1.0,"I was excited to wear these pants - the color is gorgeous in person! When I put them on for the first time I heard threads snapping. They were actually a size too big, so that was not the reason for the breaking threads. I ordered a medium and should have ordered small - I am 5 foot 6 and about 135 pounds. I didn’t see any holes initially so decided to wash them and wear again, hoping they would shrink. When they came out of the wash the threads had unraveled and the seams were all coming undone! They are clearly cheaply made and I do not recommend."
1.0,The goggles or I guess sunglasses were tiny.  Distorted vision if you look around.  Couldn’t wear and drive or was worried they would cause me to wreck.
1.0,"RUNS VERY SMALL, AND IT HAD A BAD ODOR I THREW IT IN THE TRASH NEVER AGAIN."
1.0,"I want to give a great review bit will not i was charged 20.99 over the the price and they said they did not do it. I love the boots though, they fit great. Now just waoting on the rain"
1.0,The leggings are not at all the material that that picture shows. They are completely see through. Very cheap material. I wasn't happy with them at all. Very disappointed because they look very cute and not see through on the model in pictures.
1.0,Just stay away from buying off-the-shoulder stuff here! It's always a failure.
1.0,"One of the earrings was missing a hook, and instead of fixing the problem I have to take it to a UPS location."
1.0,Esta despintada y manchada con pintura blanca. Se ve usada.
1.0,False description- this is polyester spandex
1.0,its ugly. its funky fitting. what's with the random side piece that sticks out? looks like a 6 year old made it for a class project for fat people! HORRIBLE!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!
1.0,It’s too small and I ordered a large
1.0,The Necklace turned black when worn!
1.0,"I am updating the review after used this product for sometime, it gives more blurry image and clearly that is the problem with the quality. And specifically, it is more weight and I am not able to use it for long time"
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it
1.0,Wrong size was suppose to be an X-Large!!
1.0,"The material was nice, but being a larger lady, the pattern in the dress was terrible!! I wish I could ad a picture."
1.0,I purchased this dress in Ivory.. however the material is really see through. You have to wear the perfect under garments.
1.0,Dull & tangled easy
1.0,Biggest. Joke. Ever. Way too large and more flimsy than paper. Do not waste your time or money. Sent mine back and thankfully they refunded me with no grief.
1.0,"I am not sure if this is the last one pair or not. But this is what I received. One boot with a hole and both bots are very dirty inside. It seems that some liquid was  spilt on it inside. Anyway, I am not happy with this and I will return it."
1.0,"I ordered up 2 sizes to get an oversized look for my vacation and was disappointed that this shirt was about 2 sizes smaller than my normal size. 4 sizes off! And was hard and crunchy, with no stretch. Cute but had to send back. Disappointed."
1.0,This sweatshirt is a polyester fabric that looked nice when I opened the package but after being worn only 2 times it is ready for the trash!! It is so pilled up it has fuzzies hanging off everywhere and looks horrible. Don’t waste your money like I did.
1.0,Strands were coming off constantly and it was pretty itchy
1.0,runs small quality could be better
1.0,I tried this on and loved it until I turned around and noticed a large circle cut out of the fabric in the back of the skirt part.
1.0,Item was nothing like the picture. It was flemsy and to thin.. I tried to send back and was returned Rome. Not happy!!
1.0,The smell is really overwhelming.  I can't wear it after washing numerous times.
1.0,I got this for my self-converted camper van because it was cheap and the crank handle seemed simpler and more reliable than a powered system. The crank mechanism and crank handle broke with only minimal usage. You get what you pay for.
1.0,This is not real stainless steel. It started corroding on my finger and turning it green the very first night I decided to wear it out. False advertisement.
1.0,"These are cheap metal, and they either don't fit or are so fragile that if you bend them or even wear them, they break. I broke three in as many days just walking around with one on. Would never wear them or even buy them again."
1.0,These came out of the box broken!!!!
1.0,"The listing says this is a child-size. It is definitely a large, adult-size mask. The straps are adjustable, but there is just way too much fabric to be comfortable on even my face, and I wear small/medium size masks. It actually fits my husband pretty well, but he wears large-size masks, and he is not the Kirby fan in our house. It was disappointing."
1.0,Whoever made this suit has not a clue about plus sizes.  My youngest niece could not fit into this swim suit.
1.0,"The sweatshirt quality is not great. The design feels like it will wash off, very cheaply made."
1.0,"This is a fraud product.<br /><br />I ordered these because I needed NATURAL fiber hand mitts because I work around fire (historical cooking) and don’t want acrylic melting onto my hand in case a spark touches them. I also didn’t want to take the time to knit my own.<br /><br />Upon receiving these, I was VERY suspicious. They felt acrylic and had none of the characteristics of natural fibers. I immediately did a test by heating a small piece of fuzz I managed to pull off with a lighter. Immediately it MELTED. Acrylic/polyester melts. Natural fibers like alpaca fiber does not! Had it been real alpaca fiber, it would have turned to ash. Not a sticky residue. These were sold as authentic alpaca fiber. I’m glad I did the test and did not wear these! I’ll be returning them immediately."
1.0,"Love the look and style, but very hard to put in yourself. Can't wear them unless someone is here to help latch them. Difficult insertion into the ear itself as well for to the curved post."
1.0,"Very thin, can see through them."
1.0,I regret my purchase & I would not recommend it to anyone. Everything about it SCREAMS CHEAP!!! From the weak band material that isn’t even close to any type of seatbelt to the cheap looking buckles I’m super disappointed & wish I hadn’t wasted my money on a band that I will likely never wear.
1.0,This is huge!! Pieces heavy and bulky. Not what I wanted
1.0,Don’t work no good
1.0,"I purchased these shorts for $14.98 during Amazon Prime days thinking I was getting a good deal.<br />NOT SO!  A tag in the pocket indicates they are sold at Walmart as George brand shorts for $12.86 every day.  They also have no hem...just some zig Zag stitching around the bottom edge and they're too short to hem them myself.  The fit and fabric quality are fine but they should not have been sold as a Prime Day Deal at a price that is higher than Walmart and when they are available everyday on Amazon at the same price.<br />I won't be looking for ""deals"" on prime days again."
1.0,This shirt was so small it fit my 6 year old niece comfortably.
1.0,Not as nice as my other PINK clothes. Maybe they changed material or manufacture.
1.0,Cheap looking . Looks like a pijama and the white part is completely see through .
1.0,"The grill was way too big, it looked ridiculous. So basically a waste of money."
1.0,"If you are a true American lover like myself, you refuse to buy anything from China if you can. This is made in China and not worth the cost."
1.0,"Really awfully made. Too small, wide, and short. Don't bother purchasing."
1.0,"I was very very disappointed in the way the product was advertised. It said pj set of four. However, when I decided to purchase the set of four, I realized that I have to purchase each one separately. I bought them because I really liked it for my family but I thought the way you advertised the product should have been more open, up front and direct. I felt drowned in and then trapped. It was so very disappointing."
1.0,Hole in pants by seam
1.0,"Absolutely horrible! Looked decent in pictures but when I got it I was very disappointed. Cheap looking, felt like a mix of plastic and rubber. Do not buy this!!"
1.0,Does not look like picture at all. Imitation Umgee but not done well.
1.0,"I'm pissed of, ok."
1.0,Can’t get wrist band to attach to watch. Please provide assistance
1.0,It's an okay dress. Looks like picture but it's really stiff and uncomfortable. I returned it.
1.0,Made in China  horrible quality  way way to large perfect if you are 7 feet tall and have a head the size of a watermelon  . Terribly Disappointed  !!
1.0,The dress was poorly made and thin.  I immediately sent it back.
1.0,"It arrived out of it's box and incomplete (only one strip), however it does have good quality and fits my Huawei Watch GT 2-F15, ordered size 22mm."
1.0,Not at all what I thought.  The picture makes it look like a solid material.  This is basically a floppy Halloween mask.
1.0,"Had to return these. I was looking more for a bike short fit but the legs are huge, and no where near the length pictured.these were not much more than a brief with huge leg openings, and no lining.  With the legs so short and big, I felt very &#34;exposed&#34; and not at all comfortable wearing these.  A smaller size wouldn't work, they would have been shorter!"
1.0,Absolutely Tiny!!!!!!
1.0,Lots of wrinkles after washing<br />Very hard to iron
1.0,Cheap iron on decals
1.0,I was originally thrilled. They looked beautiful and were quite sturdy - but they immediately started to tarnish - but NOT tarnish. The silver just came off leaving a dull gray metal - that was giving my neck bumps!! These are advertised as solid sterling silver.  They are not.
1.0,This was very unsatisfactory and we sent it back.  The buttons were plastic.
1.0,broke day 3
1.0,One size does not fit all. For small sizes
1.0,"Is nice design,but is very small only 4 card and ID is really hard to close 😡 I'm not happy spend to much money for nothing"
1.0,Item was too small. I used their size guides and still came too small. Couldn't even get a refund much less was offered to exchange it
1.0,"I just wanted some cute pjs that were silky and comfortable, and that made me feel luxurious and confident. Unfortunately this set is not only overpriced and cheap looking, but the shape is not flattering. I have a flat stomach and am in the 165-170 range, and it made me look like I have a gut. The seams in the garment have no stretch and feel uncomfortable when you press against them sitting and doing normal activities. My boobs keep falling out the cups and my nips show. The elastic wasteband is high wasted and makes my stomach look like a balloon, I do not recommend tucking. The only way I get the garments to look good is by keeping my shirt untucked and covering up with a robe, but to me that’s not functional. I’d be less tough on this review but honestly I’m very disappointed. This looks like a stitched together satin pillowcase made from a Joann fabric pattern, I’d leave 0 stars if I could.<br /><br />Update: the strap to the tank top also just broke and I’ve had this set less than a month"
1.0,They are so small!!!! I dnt even wear them
1.0,As others have pointed out. The fit of this shirt was strange. Ordered the extra long shirt. After one wash this shirt shrunk to above my belly button. I mean it shrunk almost an entire foot. It also bled all over my other clothes in the washer. Super dissatisfied. Would not recommend this product.
1.0,I’ve had this charm for 9 days and it's already turning.
1.0,Item was returned. Looked and felt like wearing a hooker fishnet. Not of the quality I expect from Castelli. I question whether it was  Chinese knock-off as I bought from a third party. Always had 5 star from many other Castelli purchases.
1.0,Very cutie and dainty.  Good gift for a teenage girl since the lenth may be too short for an adult.
1.0,This dress was poorly made and didn’t look anything like the picture. It came broke and was too short in length. Do not recommend to anyone.
1.0,has sharp spot that rubs wrist raw!
1.0,"I ordered this in Green and got grey.  The picture is deceiving. They don't even offer a grey so if your se r on green i would pass.  Also the picture appears to look like a knit, it is not knit, much cheaper material"
1.0,"This is an attractive item, but I wish I had read the reviews. After a weeks use, the latch broke. When it does close, it's near impossible to open. And most of the time, it springs open randomly, ejecting all of my cards. It no longer closes. Save your money and pass on this item, there are better products on the market. This is absolute trash!"
1.0,Very disappointed. Poorly made.  One of the loops isn't in the spot it belongs. I played with it for about 10 minutes trying to put the curtain that goes in back to cover the neck thinking there was a pattern of attachment but no.  It's just poorly made with a loop randomly in a word spot.
1.0,Very disappointed!! The quality is horrible and the image is crooked under the &#34;dome&#34; and the sides are all nicked.  Even the clasp on the chain doesn't close.  Looks nothing like the picture. My 13 year old is bummed.  I read all the 5 star reviews before ordering and was confident. There's no way I received the same product.  One star at best.  Future buyers beware!!!!
1.0,"This looks nothing like the picture! Not cute, or flattering. Colors are off, the whole thing is just not good looking at all."
1.0,The shoes were defective upon arrival. Buyer beware.
1.0,"They are very poor quality and I would not recommend them.  The backings were both broken whan they arrived.  I didnt mail them back to the sender, becuase I thought it would be too big of a hastle.  Waste of money."
1.0,Lasted 1 week before it stopped working
1.0,"Ordered this as I liked the print and it was cheap...You get what you pay for!  I should have known! Very cheaply made, will not withstand much for washing so not for everyday wear...has serged edges instead of hemmed edges.  Only plus to the fabric is that it is a blend of something that should not wrinkle.  If you want this for a onetime use...it would be perfect.  Otherwise dont buy."
1.0,"Should of listened to reviews, it looks nice yes but the leather is very cheap quality, if it stretches it starts to lift. I wouldn't give this as a gift . First and last time buying this through amazon. Youre better off going to Samsungs website and buy the bands for a bit more money even if  it's only for one but I know the quality is much better! Believe me I threw them away and did that instead to save a couple bucks ended up paying more"
1.0,"Arrived item has a sticker on the box ""genuine leather"". The box is different then on the customers photos. The belt is thin and cheaply painted. It's definitely not full-grain leather. Be aware!"
1.0,Item was bent upon receipt.
1.0,"The product that arrived is not at all what I ordered! Fabric pattern is similar but that's all. Also, the sizes are not US sizes and 3XL ( I ordered big knowing it ships from China) does not fit American size 10. Poorly put together. Clear attempt to make it look like the product advertised but something all together different!"
1.0,Very disappointing. They fell apart after just a few uses. The metal separated from the wood.
1.0,It was cheap quality
1.0,"The dress is beautiful, truely is and if the top chest part wasn't too big it would have been perfect for my brothers wedding. The reason I am giving a 1 star is the customer service. They offer free returns but the label they sent me did not cover the cost to return it and when I reached out to them they gave me the run around and I had to go to Amazon Customer service. So honestly I do NOT recommend buying solely for that reason. They offered no solution but to get Amazon involved after I explained the label they sent me was not going to cover the cost to return it. Do with this what you will. The dress is beautiful but not worth the hassle in my opinion."
1.0,Fabric faded after first cleaning they are very short
1.0,"Material is awful and thin like paper, super unflattering just all around bad"
1.0,Material was very thin!!! Wouldn't recommend to anyone!!!
1.0,Extremadamente grande.
1.0,Had it on for 5 minutes and one of the band of beads busted and flew everywhere.
1.0,The lenses are purple not blue like the picture
1.0,"Too small, very light and easy to see through. Zero stars if available."
1.0,La tela es muy ordinaria no me gusto
1.0,"Tight on the arms, thin material, didn't like the way dress hang.  Returned item."
1.0,It rusted within a week.
1.0,"I was really enchanted by the way that this looked on the women who posted pictures, but this did NOT fit my body shape. I'm 5'3"", apple-shaped and 195lbs. I ordered a 2XL so it would be loose enough in the shoulders to have the same ""off-the-shoulder"" look as other buyers. It looked so silly on me. The neck elastic was way too tight, and looked just weird. But the weirdest part was that the bottom is a tiny, tiny hole, so it's hard to walk in, because it restricts a full stride. The dress is shaped like a diamond, with the side points hitting me at about mid-thigh. This put the weight and emphasis at a really unflattering place. I returned it, but not before doing a few silly dances in it for my partner - at least it made both of us laugh."
1.0,"It broke the first day I got it! I ordered another one thinking that maybe it was just the one defected, it was not! Do not waster your money on this. Made of very cheap plastic."
1.0,"Too small, did not fit as expected, returned it."
1.0,Poor quality. Hinge on one pair broke after less than 5 uses. Returned.
1.0,Wasn't impressed. Has black marks on.
1.0,Disappointed.  Thought they were stoppers but they are not. Guess they are spacers ??
1.0,"Wow the pearls are beautiful and I have no problem with them, the length of this necklace is so short that it may as well be a choker but only for a very petite woman. It needs to be longer to make for a practical necklace for the common woman. My mom loved the bracelet but I had to return the necklace because it is just unreasonably too short."
1.0,Save your money this product looks cheap
1.0,Details said lobster clasp but the chain came with a regular circular clasp
1.0,Very poorly made. Cheap fabric.
1.0,There’s no structure or anything. It does not stay up if you have any ounce of breasts. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,They looked very cheap and looks like something for a child.
1.0,Disliked eriod
1.0,Broke in first hour
1.0,To small and cups gapped pretty bad.
1.0,Fit and style was good but the colors are deeper and not anything like the picture. It was the colors that drew me in to order this and I am very disappointed.
1.0,What I hate is the price I paid for socks that don't keep my feet warm
1.0,"This item took about 3 weeks to arrive. I took a chance on ordering it because it's ""Prime"" with ""free returns."" When the item arrived, I knew it was an absolute joke. There's no label, the material is thin, and the overall fit is incredibly odd (shoulders cut in making your shoulders look broad when they're not, tummy area is pouchy, shorts are almost half way between knee and hip making for an awkward length).<br />So I went to return it. GUESS WHAT, IT'S NOT FREE RETURNS. YOU HAVE TO SHIP IT YOURSELF TO CANADA. So yeah, it's going to cost more to return this item than the freaking material used to make this heinous piece of crap.<br />Skip it. Buy something from a reputable company."
1.0,They say tummy control but they aren't tight enough to do that. They're very thin also other reviews said they had pockets and they don't
1.0,Very disappointed with this product the paints chipped upon arrival of the clip attachment bar thought there were more pockets and dividers inside the tool bag for organization very let down by overall product
1.0,The shoe fastener came off the shoe the first time they were worn
1.0,"I only wore the bracelet a handful of times and it unraveled, No longer able to wear. For that kind of money, it should  last a bit longer."
1.0,I ordered one size too large and they do not fit as expected  the actually too tight.  They are in no way baggy or loose.<br />Extremely disappointed  hanging in my closet not to be worn
1.0,"This shoe is pretty but poorly made because your feet slips forward, hangs off the front and is very uncomfortable."
1.0,This is nothing like what is shown in the picture.  The material is horrible and it is just ugly.
1.0,The top part of this sweater dress is really cute.  They did something very wrong to the bottom.  It looks like it was attached to a sweater and then  stretched out of shape.  It's much longer than the picture makes it appear.  It really looks like the two parts of the dress were made by two different people and then attached together.  The person that made the bottom part failed.  Disappointed!
1.0,"Poor quality, broke as soon as I opened the umbrella."
1.0,It looks totally different in person.
1.0,Could not try on because hooks were stuck to the latch. Had to bend the hook and latch to open.... obviously that ruin the earrings.  Would not buy
1.0,"No.  Too long, material is thin and can stretch up to 2”.  Should not be sold more than $12... not worth the cost.  Returning.  Don’t recommend."
1.0,Shrink when washed.
1.0,I like the style of this shirt but I don't understand why they made the underarm holes so small.  I am petite too so I don't know how bad it would dig in the underarms of someone tall.  Disappointed and send back for a refund.
1.0,"I paid $33.03 for this case and it was not what I expected (Small and Stiff), so I wanted to return it and it cost me an additional $5.99 to ship it back and my refund was only $18.38. :-("
1.0,Does not fit well for an adult. And I do not recommend for anyone. Certainly would not want my teenager to wear this. Too short in the front and extremely awkward in the back. To embarrased to post a picture.
1.0,"Very pretty, but broke after a week of wearing."
1.0,"OMG. These are not straight fit. More like skinny. The worst part is the hideous lining. Reminds me of a cheap motel blanket, the kind that melt next to a cigarette and it's a rust orange. These should be called Snow Boarding Pants. They remind me of oven mits. The exterior is nice but they completely blew it!"
1.0,wouldnt even give this 1 star. horrible and cheaply made.
1.0,Made my arm break out in bumps and hives after 24 hours
1.0,"I loved this ring….BUT - I wore it once at a graduation, and was clapping...and lost 6 stones.... returned it and got my money back...very poor quality."
1.0,I'm a size xl in jeans and i couldn't even get this up my legs.
1.0,"Hated them. Came home from long hospital stay and opened package to wear. Can't because not cotton as described but synthetic fabric. Sensitivity to polyester. Can't wear but because of illness and being impatient so long, threw away money on misrepresented product. Gee thanks. Dig the knife a little deeper please."
1.0,It looks beautiful but the first day it came off the pin and cannot be replaced. Returning for refund
1.0,Very bad quality. I wish I could return this.
1.0,Not very comfy
1.0,I would not have spent that much money I thought it was more the size of the picture or a little smaller  Patricia Mallon
1.0,"Charms get easily lodged, one on top of the other. Band isn't that long and even with the &#34;extender&#34; clasp, the band still won't stay down."
1.0,Way smaller than indicated. Waste of money.
1.0,The color is vibrant. I bought two but the shirt sizing is off. The fabric is thin and shiny. It looks and feels of poor quality. I bought a similar shirt costing $2 more and it was better quality even in the package.
1.0,This item is a plastic piece of garbage and barely fits on a key ring. It was not worth the price paid and looks cheap and is a joke. Do not buy. Returned this immediately.
1.0,My baby is 4 months the bonnet is too big for her head it slides down to her nose dangerous
1.0,Frayed after one wash
1.0,The white is pretty see-through and material is very thin.
1.0,"I will be returning this product because when it arrived the bottom seam was ripped almost all the way around the garment. It is ripped beyond repair. Also, even though I ordered the right size according to the size chart the item was too small."
1.0,Product was two sizes too small
1.0,"Got an XL and it's like a tent on me. It's very long too which might be ok if the rest of it fit - but it doesn't.<br /><br />The shirt feels heavy and won't work for me in Texas in the summer. This shirt is stiff as a board. Not a cool summer shirt!!<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the button hole openings are horizontal, not vertical, and that does drive me crazy. Who Does That??<br /><br />I basically don't like it. Going Back!"
1.0,"Garbage. I sh$t you not, trash. I think this insult to real watches literally told time for 2 months. Do. Not.  Buy."
1.0,Super cheap. One of them wouldn't unscrew. The other one broke while increasing the end off. ...i guess should have expected this because of the low price.
1.0,Awesome clip...until it broke. Had it less than 2 weeks.
1.0,I'm still waiting for my FULL REFUND! Tooooooo small she wears a Med-Large and XXL still too small
1.0,"Not enough support--failed the bounce test.  No underwires.  And it's tight on the shoulders but just not firm enough.  Light impact ok, running--no way, they'll end up at your knees with this."
1.0,The mask was too big I didn't like it at all
1.0,I don’t like the way they fit.
1.0,I love the look of this necklace. 1 star because it came out of the package broken and I have not been able to fix it.
1.0,"I had my eye on this dress for a long time and was excited to receive it because it looked so pretty and unique. However, when it arrived, it was a size too big and the seam underneath the zipper was ripped. In addition, the fabric itself is quite cheap feeling and looking and not sewn together very well overall. I still love the dress design and I will say that the print on the fabric was accurate and crisp, but the dress was not executed very well, which maybe I should have expected for such an intricate dress at such a low price point. Such a bummer."
1.0,"These fit alright, not fantastic. They kinda shove everything to the middle and I hardly have a middle to shove in the first place. They made it look like I have more of a stomach than I do, it's odd. Also, the waist rolls down non-stop.<br /> I can deal with both those issues but my main complaint is how much they hurt! The seams in the crotch are thicker and wider than any other gym leggings I've owned and they rubbed me raw.<br />I purchased these in March and they sit in the back of the drawer until all my TSLA ones from Amazon are dirty and I forget to do laundry. So since then I've only worn them maybe 5 times. Told my husband tonight to not let me wash them - they need to go straight to the garbage!"
1.0,My son wore it for less than a month and the sandals ripped. Very poor quality.
1.0,These masks were awful. The edges were not even finished off. It was just a piece of stretchy material.
1.0,"Apparently this item ran three sizes too small. I couldn't even pull it up pass my knee cap. I read all the reviews,  I ordered up X 3 sizes."
1.0,Item ordered and packaging received say XX-Large (US MEN 12.5-15.5). My wife wears a women's 7 and she can barely get the socks on...<br /><br />Awful.
1.0,"Poor quality product. As photo, it may look good but it turned out to be rough/no quality product. Fitting is not good."
1.0,I dislike like it don’t buy it
1.0,"They were okay. Like the photo, just expected the detail to be better."
1.0,"Nothing like photo! Print looks nice from afar but as soon as you try it or look closer. It’s super cheap looking!!! Im so upset that I waited so long to get a falsely advertised item! Material is thin, cheap “satin” feel/look when the photo shows a “flowy” cotton pant. I feel very scammed!!! Give me my refund!!! I’m super upset!"
1.0,I was looking forward to getting this necklace and when it arrived it was broken and it doesn't look like the picture
1.0,"This is scrunchy, hard plastic!  I bought for a birthday present! No way I would give this to anyone."
1.0,"PROS<br />1) Skirt is hand-washable, drip dry.<br />2) It has an elastic waist, is gathered on the sides, and has a self-lining for modesty.<br />3) The Medium is a size 10.<br />4) The color is vibrant and really beautiful.  And it's nicely made, too.<br /><br />CON<br />1) The design of the skirt is problematic. The fabric has a white stripe around the hips that makes me look both wide and square.  The gathers coupled with the huge bullseyes on skirt - one on the back and one on the front - only add to the illusion of width.  It's just not flattering on me. (I am thin with curvy hips.)<br /><br />I hate to have to give such a vibrant skirt a 1 Star review.  Unfortunately, its design and cut make me look like a wide, shapeless balloon from the hips down."
1.0,Sadly this one lasted 2 weeks before it fell apart
1.0,My husband purchased this item for my Christmas gift last season. Within a few months the gold on the outside ridge began to break away causing sharp edges. Then I noticed that the gold was falling loose from the frame of the bracelet. Not worth the money and I can't wear it as it causes scratches on my skin.
1.0,I had to return because they are for a small child not an adult.
1.0,Produxt tore inside a week of travel.  Avoid!
1.0,According to the labeling these pants do fit smaller(As can be expected from the Asian market). These pants do look and wear nicely and the pockets are well placed and functional. However if you plan on squat pressing or if you happen to be a practitioner of marital arts you will need to look else wear.
1.0,These are very cute and sizing was true but I could not tolerate the smell. Have NOT worn them because even after washing twice the (toxic) smell lingers.
1.0,so thine
1.0,The fit is wonky.  The arms are different lengths and it's very see-through.
1.0,Looks good but I can't wear it.  It is really cut small.
1.0,I bought these for my daughter but they fit all wrong. Cute in picture but the waist in real life is really big for the size - almost like they were stretched out. Returned them.
1.0,This is cheap looking and the clasp is too small and weak.
1.0,"This dress looked so cute in the photos, but it is made of the same kind of material as Halloween costumes or dance costumes.  I am returning it."
1.0,Started itching and turned my skin green within a few days... :-(
1.0,Bad quality. Wrong dimensions.
1.0,"I was very disappointed with the fabric the suit was made of.  The fabric was of poor quality, in addition to being stiff as a board.  I have nothing good to say about it.  The moment I took it out of the bag I knew it was something I would not wear.  The picture the seller showed on Amazon gave the impression it was a classy/high-end suit.  Take a look at the picture and see what you think.  I was looking forward to wearing the suit to a special function.  The suit was a size 12 and was too big (I usually wear a 12).<br /><br />By the way, this and a number of other sellers have this style suit in numerous colors.  GOOD LUCK"
1.0,"Was Eeyore and Tigger - Received Tigger only, contacted Amazon ~ no problem will reorder and send out.  Again, only received Tigger."
1.0,Something you'd buy on a rack in Bangkok for $3. Look fake. Bad style. I literally threw mine in the garbage immediately. Not even worth the time it'd take me to repackage and bring to an Amazon return depot at the local 7/11. Trash.
1.0,"cheaply made, very short, and not the same color as the picture. A very unattractive shirt."
1.0,This was tiny...
1.0,Feels so cheaply made. Gonna be in the closet collecting dust
1.0,Very poor quality. It’s one layer which doesn’t protect a all. Don’t buy
1.0,"It came incomplete, missing one earring"
1.0,"Nuca recibí esta falda y hice mi reclamación pero ello dijeron que ya lo avían entregado pero no lo recibí, Y no me dieron un reembolso y perdí mi dinero."
1.0,"I ordered an extra large, just in case they ran small. This is very small!. doesn't fit anyone I know. maybe a ten year old girl. It measures 12 inches across the waist and doesn't stretch at all. I tried sending it back. I guess no one wanted it cuz I got no response."
1.0,"The lettering is not complete, I would like a replacement"
1.0,Definitely need to order up in sizes. I ordered a XXL and it won't even fit my 13 y/o granddaughter! Waaay too small!
1.0,This shirt runs small!!!!!!! Order a XL and fits like a small
1.0,"I really liked these at first, they started ""pilling"" really quickly, but wasn't too worried. I think I have 3 pair and I have three different socks that have holes in them (none in the same spot) I didn't even wear them much, or doing anything like running or hiking. I really liked the materials, feel, and look, but ultimately wouldn't buy again due to durability issues."
1.0,Top coat was way to thick to even apply. Liquid cement consistency. Very disappointed.
1.0,This watch had one of the small number indicators came loose and lodged into the gears. The watch stopped working. Seems like an expensive watch to only last 6 months.
1.0,This are cute but I bought them for my daughter and they ended up too big and heavy not recommended for childeren but good for adults
1.0,"Said it was returnable,  forgot to mention,  the return cost twice what the product cost. Sizing was off by about 2 sizes.  Not happy with this seller."
1.0,"I was about to wrap this for my daughter for the Holidays but the bottom piece was a little skewed so I lightly tugged on it to straighten it and a chunk of the small ring holding the top and the bottom just broke off... there was no salvaging it so it went straight into the trash. Very weak, bad materials in these... though the color and sparkle was absolutely gorgeous."
1.0,"I either got someone else's return, or the quality control is just THAT poor, because one of the shoes arrived with a broken strap."
1.0,With my experience the bra doesn't work. I bought a D and that's what I wear and it gave me zero support also it was extremely small. My daughter is a C so I gave it to her and it didn't work for her either. It kinda smooshes your breasts together offering zero support and you can see the thickness of the bra through any shirt or dress you wear. Also the box looked all crushed (the bra was fine no damage at all) and there wer no instructions with it(I have seen many videos online how to use to so I was well informed) that could be a problem for somebody who ever seen a tutorial on how to use this bra. Save your money
1.0,This photo is after giving them on for 3 hours I would not recommend
1.0,This is way too smal!
1.0,When they arrived I was pleased at how pretty they were. Then I tried to wear them out to dinner and the post that goes into my ear broke right off. Disappointed because I looked forward to wearing them.
1.0,These look nothing like the photo. And one was broken upon arrival. The other broke the next day. Disappointed...
1.0,"Dislike, to small and thin"
1.0,Below average and low quality
1.0,"The sweater I received is not the sweater I ordered. I ordered gray, the sweater I got is nearly white. Nothing like the dark gray that shows in the picture. Also the stitching looks nothing like the picture. THIS is why I stopped ordering clothes from Amazon years ago... I figured, I'd try again. Maybe it had gotten better over the years.<br />Sadly no and now I'm out $30 for a sweater that looks NOTHING like the product pictured..<br />Lesson learned.. again.."
1.0,I returned this product right away. It's advertised and shown as light pink. It's not. It's brown.
1.0,"Cheap,  I returned it"
1.0,"Cheapest made coat I’ve EVER seen. Arrived with a hole in the pocket. The pocket unsewn from the coat itself as seen in pic, and also was sewn so screwed up you can’t even put your hand in. The entire coats seams are done with a single stich. Lining already pulling away in shreads. Thin plastic buttons complete the cheap look. Yikes. Keep looking."
1.0,"I’m not one to write reviews, I got these about a week ago and the one I put in started rusting after only a few days."
1.0,"Not even right costume, supposed to be 6 foot dinosaur and it’s a pair of pants with alligator biting the butt"
1.0,Amazon was most gracious and allowed me to return it.
1.0,Not like pictured... This item is very small and doesn't come below my belly button. I will have to wear this as a crop top this summer because it's definitely not when I expected. Get a MUCH larger size if you want it anything like the picture.
1.0,jf
1.0,"No pockets, and pockets are a must for me! The upper thigh legs were bigger than I expected. These would be a perfect pair for sleeping in, not a pair you would wear out in."
1.0,"I was so excited to use this and the color of this luggage was beautiful! I took a trip to New York and once I went to baggage claim I was sad to find that one of my front wheels broke off and the bottom part of the shell was cracked. I really did not want to spend that much more on finding a luggage again flying back, so I tested out just to see how durable this luggage really was. Keep in mind, this is the larger checked in luggage. Flying back, I laughed by just how weak this material was with the luggage. The front part of the luggage cracked and the back wheel came off AND the TSA lock wasn't working anymore. Also there is this heavy chemical smell that is inside the luggages and even with washing it the smell still got on my clothes. So safe to say, I won't be purchasing luggages online anymore and don't bother wasting your money."
1.0,Earring fell apart before I left the house-first time wearing them. Totally unacceptable!
1.0,"They are cute, but stem of one earring was bent. Too much work to box it up and return it"
1.0,"I like this style of clamp,  unfortunately the pair that I bought broke the third time I used them."
1.0,Advertising on Amazon said that it would fit Pandora bracelets. I gave it to my Fiance on Christmas and was very embarrassed when it did not fit. I am returning this product and not buying from Brilliant Love or NINAQUEEN again!
1.0,Paper thin and completely see through. I will be returning these.
1.0,"I ordered 2 T shirts, both the same size (10 - 12) and received one the correct size and one a lot smaller even though they have a tag saying they are the same size. See photo."
1.0,Junk! Do not buy!  Some of the earrings I received were not even diamond studs as pictured. They were just flat . Totally disappointed and thinking about returning
1.0,The leather does not look like leather and smells moldy.  I am disappointed with the necklace.
1.0,"cheap product,  I had not even had a chance to wash it yet and there is a tear in the seam on the side.  probably worn it 3-4 times."
1.0,"The pics on the earring are so faint and blurred, looks very cheap."
1.0,Lense broke out on the first day I wore them. Not worth it.
1.0,me llego el estuche vacio sin el reloj
1.0,"I thought this was a woven cotton beanie. It is made of cheap spandex.  The beanie opens at the top, so it is like a beanie/head band.  The color design was printed on and not dyed.  It looks super cheap/ generic.  It also came smelling of a very strong nauseous perfume or deodorant.  So strong it literally hurts to smell it."
1.0,"Very uncomfortable , my son doesn't want to wear them (which is unusual for him). Don't buy!"
1.0,"Ordered grey like the picture, and received a weird icy blue shade."
1.0,"This top was  way overpriced but I took a chance anyway because I liked the style...<br /> I have to say for a size 6 it is way too small. There is no way that my granddaughter’s head could even fit into the tiny hole...I think they need to redo their sizing in India... I am not saying this in a critical way because I know in China they also size very small I do want to say though the material itself feels good but I don’t know how it’s going to wash I have a feeling this cotton shrinks a lot... it almost feels like it’s bamboo....Or, maybe they should’ve mentioned that it runs small so I would’ve bought a larger size so I’m returning it..."
1.0,It says &#34; for Pierced + Non Pierced Ears&#34;. It's mainly for people with pierced ears. Most of the earrings have a post. I don't have pierced ears. I will send these back.
1.0,DESCRIPTION STATES:<br />Victory FlexStrap Chinstraps are compatible with Riddell SpeedFlex helmet with housing meant for the ratchet style strap.<br /><br />IT DOES NOT FIT.<br />.THERE ARE NO RIDGES ON THE BOTTOM STRAP TO FIT THE RIDELL...<br /><br />WISH HE WLD HAVE READ REVIEWS BEFORE- bad BUSINESS
1.0,3x fits like xl at best  . zipper on wrong side. big let down
1.0,"The zipper on this coat is horrible. If I fight with it long enough I can get it zipped, but it gets stuck all the time, making it basically unwearable. It's a shame because the coat itself is ok, but if I can't zip it, it's basically of no use to me."
1.0,"I’ve had this flag flying for only a few weeks, and it’s already faded to a color that is not representative of the team. Should be Navy or Midnight Blue, but is actually purple.<br /><br />I would return it if I could."
1.0,Unless your neck and waist are about the same size this will not fit. I could fit 3 necks in this thing and the way it puckers in the front makes you look like you have a giant stomach very unflattering. I ordered a small and I am 5' and 105lbs I am not a big person this thing fits awful and I ordered it before all the reviews posted in the last week if i had seen this i would have never even considered this. I honestly think I could wrap a sheet around me and look better than this. Save your money!!!!
1.0,It’s a nice product in the magnet is strong. Difficult to use if you are attempting to charge the watch. It stays circular and so you don’t have the opportunity to lay it flat as needed to charge the watch. It becomes problematic
1.0,I returned this.
1.0,Muy pequeño Tenía que coger XL y peso 180
1.0,These say they are anti-slip but they slip which defeats the purpose of them!
1.0,Garbage. Don’t buy
1.0,Completely see though on the white color
1.0,"Wig was not at all like picture, really poor quality, hair goes all over the place (mostly sticking upright) and doesn't fall naturally at all. Not like the photo."
1.0,Broke the first day and had to return. Leather piece came out from the clasp.
1.0,The dress is beautiful and it fits great...the downside is the fabric....very see through.  I would buy if it was made of a different fabric
1.0,"Not very well made... They make an ""under-wing"" in the areas stretching from the armpits to the breasts. Not flattering. At least, not on me (36 D with broad shoulders). Also, didn't love the low fabric quality.<br />They were a good deal and I didn't send them back... I gave them away to someone with a smaller chest and more narrow shoulders."
1.0,The zipper broke within less than a month of usage.
1.0,"Very flimsy, broke almost immediately"
1.0,The leather was not fully attached to the handle.
1.0,Super thin/fine material.  See through.  Arrived with the tag cut out..
1.0,Poor quality. Don’t bother.
1.0,Verrrry cheap quality and small.
1.0,"These shirts size were all over the place. I wear a large shirt, jacket, t-shirt I ordered a large and it's too long. Too tight at neck and too loose at waist. I am 5ft11in 165ish pounds"
1.0,Awkward fit for me. Was disappointed!
1.0,"9-10 ball rack arrived damaged.<br />8ball rack almost tight , third ball on the edge always with a gap."
1.0,"Not as depicted. Grey is lighter color, looks cheap"
1.0,"These shoe fell apart after just one week of wear.  The flower came off first, then the strap pulled out of the shoes.  What a disappointment."
1.0,It came with out the butterfly
1.0,I hate that you go to a local store and this are expensive but when you think you ordered the same thing here the Gems fall out within a week yet the pair I bought from the store have the gems still and wore them for over a month with rough cleaning and they are still like perfect :(
1.0,"true to size - however, the &#34;hold&#34; was not good enough for me ... once sweat hits them, they get lose"
1.0,They look great but fall off too easily even when at the tightest setting
1.0,Even too small for my face masks. Also the storage bag was missing.
1.0,Not what it looks like in the picture.
1.0,"it looks fake, I do retune and they give me back my money, but for me, it looks like plastic, and don't Waite that for coach watch."
1.0,"Item received is NOTHING like described. It’s a heavy material, nothing like the picture."
1.0,Seam in the pants ripped after first wear. Waste of money.
1.0,The quality of the material is awful.
1.0,"received many complements , flattering cut"
1.0,Returning it!!! Awfull material. Bunches up.
1.0,This slippers are not recommended at all.
1.0,Comfortable fit but does nothing for the glare other than turn it yellow.
1.0,Unusual material. Runs very big.  Did not line.
1.0,Frist time I used it -it broke it is not worth putting the order out for it. I work on waitches this is the only peace of junk I have ever got Ian so sorey
1.0,Very thin and was very short. I sent it back.
1.0,I ordered a pair of Nike Capri but instead got a pair of Brooks mini shorts.
1.0,"the band is too tight, rough itchy material on the inside of the elastic band, it scratched your skin and leave a big red skin rash on the forehead and ears. 1st and last time to wear."
1.0,Incredibly flimsy and cheap With no support at all they feel like you’re just walking on the ground
1.0,"Total crap. Listen to the reviews. Absolutely not made of the material pictured. Think of cheap recycled t-shirts. Also, I'm a big dude and these were so big the cloth covered my eyes. These are throw away purchases. You will regret purchasing these masks."
1.0,Opened it up it is a ugly cheap purse
1.0,"It’s not worth it. It never came with the belt. So disappointing. If I were you, I’d buy a different costume."
1.0,These stick to the bottom of your shoe for about 100 steps and then they fall off. Huge waste.
1.0,Love the initial but the chain is basically a silver thread. It wasn’t even threaded through the initial and took me forever because it’s so light. Seriously need to up the chain weight on this. I planned on giving as a gift but now have to buy a new chain and have a jeweler thread it because the bail won’t fit.
1.0,Colors inaccurate to picture and source material.  Not blue but purple.
1.0,Lens cracked and chipped not worth the money!!!!!!!
1.0,"I normally wear a 1x, ordered a 2x so it wouldn’t be too tight, and it did not even come close to fitting...skin tight, ridiculously small sizing. The color of the background is like brown mustard, not true “yellow “  it seems like it is well made. Will have to give it to my daughter..."
1.0,"Not remembering that the product includes an auto close button, i reached inside to close the umbrella and quickly cut myself on the sharp ribs inside."
1.0,The caps were small and tight. The pack of dozen was used for a food booth in a church fundraiser and the ladies could hardly fit them through the top of their heads so not like what the photo showed. Not sanitary to return them so we’re stuck with this item.
1.0,"First of all, the color was slightly off from the picture. It appeared to me to be a nice bright yellow but it really is more of a chartreuse, or a mustardy color with a slight hint of green. Even my husband, who is color blind, noticed it right away. It does have that night bright yellow color I was looking for on the inside though, which leads me to believe the product was somehow faded or sun damaged or something like that. Who knows? Even though I was disappointed in the color, I liked the size and everything else seemed to be as pictured. So I was still willing to live with it. As soon as I took it out of the package and tried to open it, the zipper pull came off right in my hand. I never even got to open the zipper compartment ONE TIME before the zipper came off. Still, you get what you pay for, I was annoyed but not quite ready to throw in the towel yet. I got a pair of needle nose pliers and bent and manipulated the little ring thingy to reattach the zipper. After that we were good to go........for a couple of days. By the end of the week, the whole zipper compartment has busted open. I zip it closed and the pops open In the middle. All I had in there was a few dollar bills, chapstick and a small set of house keys. I can no longer keep anything inside the zipper compartment because one day while walking to the store, half way there I noticed the compartment was busted open my house keys were missing. I had to go back and retrace my steps to go find them. Luckily I did. Anyway, like I said this was an inexpensive product and I certainly didn't expect the highest quality item, but I did expect to at least get through the summer with it. It didn't even last a week! I'm too lazy to return it (lazy, or just tried from the long stupid walk trying to find my keys???) so I figured I could at least channel my frustration into writing a snarky review and hopefully saving someone else some minor, first world trouble."
1.0,Broke every 5 second with barely anything in it.Will never buy again
1.0,"I had to return this product it was so bad. The tag was actually ripped off so you couldn't see what size it was and this was clearly a small or a medium, both of which I cannot fit. Dropped it off at whole foods and got a refund, no hassle."
1.0,Too small unable to return as expected given product was prime order.
1.0,Runs really small.  I love leopard print clothes and shoes!
1.0,"There is absolutely no “tummy control”! It’s a thin elastic band set really high in the waistband that just digs in. The fabric is loose under this band, so it makes you look like you have a muffin top AND a muffin bottom. Just ridiculous. I returned them."
1.0,"This piercing ring looks a lot cheaper than the photos, and the clicker is so hard to open. I don’t even dare to put that on in case I can’t take it off."
1.0,"Had to send back. The straps do not stay ""snapped."" I did not realize they are buttons. This would not work anyways. It's unfortunate that they would even sell something like this know ing it will not work."
1.0,Expensive return $22.50
1.0,Cheap!! I like this style ear ring...But Not These!!.<br />I got them on flash deal thank God...They we're listed for 30 something original price...So I thought surely they'd at least have an actual valur of more than $2.00...DON'T BUY!
1.0,It's not the right size! And has glitter in it. It was listed as a men's ring. I'm very much not happy with this product.
1.0,"The color on the gray shirt is deceiving, it is a darker gray than shown, so the black text is barely readable. Disappointing."
1.0,"Son bonitos, pero muy pequeñitos son para niñas pequeñas"
1.0,The box came without the band inside. All I received was an empty box.
1.0,It broke after one used
1.0,Didn't have the dangle pretty on it as picture showed - zipper kept separating
1.0,"Nice Amethyst. The bar may be good steel but the material the stones are set in are not,  had a very bad reaction."
1.0,"It's not a hat, it's a disaster. Came completely smashed in, it's formless and looks awful on my head."
1.0,"It broke as soon as I opened it, very bad quality"
1.0,"Cheap is the first word that comes to mind when I think about this item. Fabric is thin and stretches a lot. Fabric fiber easily starts to pull and pill. It is doing this as I am wearing a new pair for only one day? These are no where near the type you get at the hospital. Size is accurate. For example, I wear a size 10. The XXL size seems to be aligned what someone would want if they were a size 11 or even size 12 shoe size. Overall, I am unhappy with this purchase. I do not recommend this product unless you are purposely looking for a thin sock that will get thrown away after a washing or two. I consider these one or two time wear disposable socks."
1.0,Does not have any effect on night driving or fog.<br />I don't recommend them.
1.0,very cheap looking...not what I expected:(
1.0,Wore them 3 times and they the material started to pull on the front legs and then came apart at the back pocket seam. Very disappointed.
1.0,Jersey it’s self is nice. However. It runs about two sizes small. Just be aware when ordering the right siza
1.0,Advertised as a womens size but its clearly for juniors. Way too small to wear. Wasted $20.
1.0,Could have been cute but was so big!
1.0,Torso is too short.
1.0,This fit terribly.  Would not recommend
1.0,"The sizing is off, and they were wayyyy to small, doesnt really look like the picture, more like parachute pants, with bows."
1.0,"AVOID! If I could give negative number stars, I would. I’ve worn about five pairs of the set only one time apiece and already, all of them have holes. The fabric is thin and absolute garbage. I’ve never seen worse quality. How someone can proudly manufacturer and sell these socks, I don’t know."
1.0,Doesn't even fit my 6 year old it's too tight
1.0,No focal
1.0,"These are poorly made junk! As the photos show, the stitching and fabric are coming apart. This is straight out of the package. My daughter never wore them. They also run about a size too small. Going straight back. They wouldn’t last a day!"
1.0,"Broken within the first 24 hours, after very minimal use or handling...  If you want something like this, spend a little more to get MUCH more as purchasing this is like throwing your money away!"
1.0,"The gems look so pretty, why do you have yo make it out of cheap material?! The red spirit stone came chipped already, and the gems look ugly when their color is chipped."
1.0,horrible.
1.0,I would give this zero stars it’s too small looks nothing like the picture in size and it doesn’t close once to put it in and after you take it out to close it. Waste of money!!!!
1.0,Till now i still can't believe why in the world i order this jacket.it's ugly and maybe even my grandma will not wear this.Not for me and everytime i tried to put it on and look at the mirror it hurts my eye lol.But then again this is just me and my opinion.
1.0,Came broken :(
1.0,Cute but no room for busy area
1.0,"hard to find shirt like  ths  where I live.  Walmart has  a few occasionally,cheaper than this one, but quality and selections much  better  at this store.  Got this for my son in l aw who restores cars.  He wore it to car show and concert tonight,  Shirt is well worth the money and I recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful quality shirt."
1.0,Shirt fell apart as soon as we opened it.
1.0,Design and quality has changed -  Fabric is very thin and can tear easily. Zipper breaks and no pockets - the old style had pockets.  Would not recommend this coverall anymore.
1.0,"This piece is so beautiful. I fasten the clasp, held my hand out to admire it on my wrist...and it broke. I didnt even touch anything. I was heartbroken. I literally hadn't worn it a full minute."
1.0,The black started coming off onto my fingers. At first I couldn’t figure out where the black was coming from and realized the color comes off. Smaller than others I’ve used
1.0,Waaaaaaaay too big. Not made for a woman's wrist. It just falls right off.
1.0,"Very cheap material, fits horribly"
1.0,"Although the seller sent this super quick, the item was sub-par. I ordered two of these, one for each hand. I have average size female hands but these are made for small/child hands. The stretchy string holding the beads and bones together isn't very strong and I didn't even get one on without the string breaking on the beaded rings with the beads flying everywhere. I'm going to try to fix it with extra parts and stronger string from the hobby store cause they are kinda cool. Hard to return because I believe the seller is in China."
1.0,"This product was a disaster since it arrived the base immediately broke, after that the umbrella top snapped leaving me with nothing but a broken umbrella on my deck. Do not buy"
1.0,broke within an hour.
1.0,The product is not true to look and fit.
1.0,One of the stones fell out relatively fast and then the bracelet broke in half where it locks.
1.0,Horrible quality control standards - misprinted the baby’s name on my order.
1.0,So flat like an ass
1.0,"The picture for this item does NOT do it justice; so here are a couple REAL, unaltered photos of what you will actually get. Not only did this take more than a month to arrive, it does not look nearly as good as the photo. This is cheap and that IS why I made the purchase, however I did not expect a pixilated cardboard cutout beneath a glass dome. I can’t say that I truly expected more than what I got. I think this would be great for a child just wasn’t quite what I was looking for. And do enlarge these images I have provided so you can see what I’m talking about."
1.0,Wasn’t as expected chains hanging
1.0,My search was for a man's sterling silver necklace......this one I received was barely long enough for my 5 year old niece.
1.0,Nasty fabric. Returned. To small
1.0,Received the product and immediately returned it.  The sizing for the strap was correct but the over strap was way too large and thus unable to actually hold the footware to my foot.
1.0,These run small and they are for short people I’m average height and they are short.
1.0,"I bought these at a pool store for the summer.  The store did not have the brand of goggles I usually buy for my kids and I didn't want to wait for shipping, and these looked cool.  My son was excited at first, but now he won't wear them because he says they hurt.  I also bought my daughter a pair of these (in a girl design) and she won't wear them either because they don't stay on.  So I just ordered the old brand my kids like.  These are a waste of money."
1.0,"It is a waste of money, poor material, looks cheap, it don’t feet well, it is not comfortable. The ribbon is right over the ear and If you put it over, you can see nothing.<br />Don’t buy it!!!"
1.0,"Very Flimsy, and cheap, dont buy."
1.0,The nose rings are way too long and come out every time I wash my face and dry it with a towel. They are not bent enough so they come right out.
1.0,"Front of the watch is the star attraction.  Domed glass, fair to good fit and finish.  Black looks like paint and not anodized, but it's not a deal breaker for me.  The 3 complications small dials has black hands on dark grey dials, it's hard to read in low light from the reduced contract, but small hands are aligned correctly with the markings.<br /><br />The glass back is snap in type with an o ring and not screwed, so the water resistant claims could be exceedingly hopeful rather than fact.<br /><br />My major complaint is the movement is slow by more than 7 minutes per hour (not days!).  It's not usable as a time piece.  Returned.  It's possible mine is a one off as I've had good experience with the cheap automatics."
1.0,Shirt seemed to be flowy but was actually pretty reduced
1.0,Did not like the fabric or how the stitching on the front looked. Didn't lay across the bustline right. Looked weird. Returned the shirt.
1.0,The skinniest jeans ever. Can’t even pull them on
1.0,Suit runs small.14/16 fits a girl size 4/5 not happy
1.0,This dress fit almost perfectly. It’s a little big in the bust. The fabric is really nice for 20 dollars. I am going to wear this to a wedding. The dress overall is great. I have two complaints. One is the zipper is cheap and I feel like it’s going to break. Two is that the petticoat under the dress itches in the back by the zipper. It’s annoying. But I put a pair of shorts on underneath and I can’t feel it at all. I really love this dress the color is great and the material is nice. I kind of want to get the black or yellow one!!!<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Wore it to a wedding. I tried to unzip it and it broke. I only wore it once... Woomp Woomp...
1.0,It worked about a month.
1.0,"I bought what I thought was a matching set- leggings, sports bra, and crop top. When I finally received my items the leggings were a different color than the sports bra and top. I contacted the seller and all they said was that it was due to a different thickness. However, they weren't different shades but completely different colors. Seller didn't offer any help whatsoever. Am returning all items."
1.0,"I bought these for my toddler since we have non-carpeted floors. I have bought non-skid socks before, but these are coming apart just after about 2 to 3 washes at the part where the different colors meet. I feel I paid good money for these and was ripped off. Other brands I bought still hold up after months of use."
1.0,"Sizing on these are very inaccurate. I ordered this dress by the seller's sizing guide. The XXL came and was smaller than the XL of the same exact dress. The XXL had a US size tag that said it was size 12, and the XL had a US size tag that said it was a 14."
1.0,I don't remember how many times I wear it but the arm broke from silver point in the first few weeks. Waist money and don't recommend.
1.0,My son like it very much
1.0,One pair arrived broken. The lens were snapped in three pieces. The other pair was okay. Couldn't see the color when looking at my reflection though
1.0,Product is not fit as in the picture
1.0,These slippers look purple because they sent fushia and I wanted hot pink. No return info or invoice included so have to rebox and send bk
1.0,"The measurements were wrong, I usually buy a couple of pairs of shoes, so theres no reason for 2 other pairs to fit and not these ones"
1.0,One of the seams came undone within an hour of wearing.
1.0,"I have to return this for the following reasons. Not even close to what they advertised. Super thick and doesn't not wrap around your neck nicely, just turns into a giant blob that looks more like a neck brace. Colors are also way off. Super disappointed."
1.0,Cheap shoes no lining
1.0,"The design is lovely! The colors are vivid! Unfortunately because the fabric is of a really thin summer fabric, I think you would need to be on the small size of the chart !"
1.0,"The color of the beads is nothing like the picture. My beads were drab, dullish, dark, and didn't shine or have the light come through the gems like in the picture. I was sorely disappointed in how mediocre and dull the beads are, compared to the photo."
1.0,Broke within 3 mos.
1.0,The padded center is thin. The adhesive makes my skin break out and itch. These are so sticky they will wax your nipples right off. Cheaper than buying them at the drug store but not worth the savings. I would NOT recommend these!
1.0,I was excited to receive the colorful socks for my granddaughter. But I received a different style and was<br />unhappy with the substitution.
1.0,You get no free returns on this one folks. You have to pay a restocking fee plus shipping and handling. I bought this shoe for my seven-year-old-- it was a little too small but then I went to return it and learned I had to pay $11 plus a restoking fee! It  just wasn't worth it. I will never buy this again.
1.0,"Color what was expected, overall length is fine but overall size too small and sleeves too short.  I am 5'6 and not overweight, so this is not what I expected."
1.0,"IMHO this watch is a complete waste of money because it is so poorly designed and .engineered. The two most egregious failings are:<br />(1) A poorly designed clasp on the watch band. This clasp does not function properly and as a result, it will NOT STAY ON YOUR WRIST; and<br />(2) The hour hand and the minute hand are advertised as being luminous so the time can be read in the dark. These hands were completely unreadable in the dark. With every luminous watch dial and/or hands I have seen, shining a very bright light on the face of the watch will “activate” or “wake up “ the luminous treatment so the time can be read in the dark. On this watch, the hands NEVER GLOWED after having a very bright light shined on the dial.<br />(3) Finally, the picture of this watch is very misleading. As depicted on the sellers listing, the dial is shown as being a slightly darker than normal shade of blue. In reality, this watch’s dial is almost black and looks nothing like the dial shown in the seller’s ad.<br /><br />Don’t waste your money on this watch as it is a real POS. I now have to waste my time re-packaging this watch and printing out a shipping return label."
1.0,"This watch strap appears to be made of foam, and is difficult to bend, so you can tell the design will crack right away. Terrible, cheap product, certainly not worth what they are charging!!"
1.0,Was bummed out it ran small. Oh well.
1.0,They feel very uncomfortable. The fit is terrible. Not recommended.
1.0,USED TWICE AND RIBS BENT
1.0,I bought this for my graduation out of town only to put it on and the zipper was messed up. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️I'm glad I brought another option I'm so mad
1.0,Sent this to my 89 year old father. He says<br />They are too big and can't wear them
1.0,these were originally described as 5 inch strobe lights but they are actually 3 inches.
1.0,terrible! Sent back
1.0,Dislike item
1.0,Didnt even get to wear them a week one day it was over 100 degree's where i live and i got ready to put my shades on and as i lifted them up they broke in half
1.0,Very thin. Not cotton. Returning this product.
1.0,These are not real leather.  I ordered the small because I have small hands and They fit as expected.  I think these are really nice gloves for the price but I hate they were falsely advertised as actual leather.  I hope the hold up.
1.0,"Horrible, these will sour too easily."
1.0,Didn't even try them on. They came in a bag and when I pulled them out they were so cheap feeling it wasn't even worth putting them on. It felt like they were made of thin plastic.
1.0,"I purchased a small and have similar measurements of the model, but the top was very large on me. I looked at other reviews and it seems that many people stated that the top runs small and is form fitting, which is the opposite of what was received"
1.0,"Honest to goodness, after reading reviews of this 'SUNNOW Women Fashional Slim Shirt&#34; I have to believe that those who &#34;love&#34; the shirt had to have received a different shirt altogether.  I've been searching and searching for a white long-sleeved button down shirt for work, to no avail.  After opening up the folded shirt, every button I unbuttoned from the holes were stuck with thin threading where I had to delicately pull thread from each button.  The material is made of something I've never worn or felt before; it's like a disposable shirt, honestly!  I'm 5'4, 128 lbs with a 34 bust and the shirt is a tight fit and I don't think I'll be wearing it to work.  Again, when reading the reviews, one has to believe that they most definitely wearing a different shirt made by a different company and I'll bet anyone dollars to donuts that they are Amazaon Prime Members.  What say you?"
1.0,I received the mask with missing stones and it was sewn crookedly. The material is barely comparable to the thickness of 1-ply toilet paper! Unacceptable and cheap!
1.0,It fits much larger than a medium.
1.0,"This mask will cover my entire face, and still have room left. This won't fit anybody of normal stature, not to mention the app that it uses is completely janky and haphazardly programmed. I would not recommend this brand."
1.0,largest size is too small - sent back
1.0,Didn't work. Broken.
1.0,Tiny cloths not worth the money.
1.0,"Doesn't give accurate readings. I'll take my temperature orally three times in a row and get readings that different by 2 to 3 degrees. One reading it will be 96.1, second reading 99.7, and third reading 98.4"
1.0,"The shirt fit alright when first worn. However, after it was washed and dried, it SHRUNK ABOUT THREE SIZES! I gave it to my grandson. I am TOTALLY DISSATISFIED!"
1.0,This was made with very cheap material.
1.0,"It broke 2 days after the return deadline, and I can't seem to get in touch with the company"
1.0,i ordered 3 of these watches and they either came with a dead battery or battery went dead within a week.
1.0,Gave these as a Christmas gift and they are falling apart already!
1.0,"These pants went straight to the garbage. I’m not sure what kind of material they’re made of, but it felt cheap and scratchy. There was no return label so I threw them away. Do not waste your money. There are plenty of affordable, comfortable, cute lounge pants on Amazon. Keep shopping."
1.0,Of course they make the cap size different than the other flask so I have a straw now for nothing. Item look good but Ill never know how it works. They package the product inter tangled in the crease of the seal so you open the package and rip the bottle. If they refund me I will order again and review the product which looked pretty good.<br /><br />Update* Returned the item to a Locker never heard from it again its been almost two months.
1.0,I didn't care for the way the felt.
1.0,The dress was shrink wrapped.  The wrinkles were so set in that I don’t think they would ever come out.  The dress is extremely short (I’m 5’2”).  And the material was so unusual it was almost slimy - maybe because of the packaging? I do not recommend this dress.
1.0,"Yuck on style (pic looks cuter), yuck, yuck, and yuck on quality 🤢"
1.0,I did not receive what I paid for. The shade of blue is horrible.
1.0,Very cheap looking comes apart very easy
1.0,"I got this as a casual hangout dress... after trying it on,I wouldn't wear it as a nightgown! The material was soft enough but looked like a linen knockoff. A large was too tight all over at 5'8&#34; 158 lbs. and 38' C.<br />It looked like prison garb. Plain and ugly!"
1.0,Did not wrap around enough to cover my no no area
1.0,It’s super cute but it breaks way too fast
1.0,sizes were way to big
1.0,After taking off to shower
1.0,Too tight throughout but mostly on the sleeve.  The fabric is itchy and very thin.
1.0,"The clasp was broken. There is also an extra amount of fabric in between the straps in the front, it like waves and bumps out.<br />Just beware with this purchase, looks like some people have had success, I just was not one of those people."
1.0,This was extremely small. My 8 year old<br />Could not get in it at all.
1.0,I wear it as a moo moo dress
1.0,One side of the band fit but the other side was a different size and was too small to fit on the watch. I plan to return as it’s unusable.
1.0,This shirt is for tiny people. It is very thin. Almost see through. I will find a tiny person to give it to or return it.
1.0,Terrible fitting garment.
1.0,I order this thinking my 12 month old could wear and it's way to big!
1.0,lens quality is poor
1.0,This says Mens in the title... but is in fact BOYS sizing.
1.0,buy ray bans you peasants
1.0,Cheap made I rhink it actualy makes my boobs way smaller and hurts bc there is no padding just a really flat tight layer of fabric for the cup I didn't think it would be so bad when I orders but i was so wrong ill keep to the same one from fall sweets its made way better an worth the money
1.0,Really poor quality. Looked a year old after only 1 week of wear..
1.0,It's not what I was expecting doesn't look anything like the picture too big. And it said free shipping and you charged me $10 I want them back please.
1.0,Estaba confundido con las medidas.
1.0,The product is not the same as advertised on the picture. Very short when it should be long covering the butt area like it looks on the picture.  Don't waste your time and money.
1.0,Item received not at pictured the neckline is much smaller and the print was poorly done
1.0,The key chain is super small nothing what I imagined
1.0,"Leather over cardboard, cracks all over the place after short usage. Not worth buying."
1.0,Material is very heavy to the wearer opening your sweat pours making it uncomfortable. Disappointed I had to return item.
1.0,The dress faded badly after 1 wash.
1.0,Really disappointed. It was a nice wallet until my husband started to put his stuff in it and the middle piece fell apart. Will be returning
1.0,Polyester is not cotton. I would not have bought this if I had known.
1.0,"Huge buckle - way too big for my taste. If you really want people to know you have this belt on, wear it. They will know."
1.0,Just spend the money and get Lululemon. These felt cheap and fit/looked odd.
1.0,The charm is very scratchy when I WEAR IT
1.0,Very cheap! The chains do not adjust so for a tiny haed and wrist it will not work. Waste of money
1.0,"O my dear God , please don’t u ever order this pants , it’s 100 % scam , nothing look like a picture, cheapest material I ever see , ugly ugly pants make me so sad and angry , I was waiting for delivery almost 1 month and look what I get it ….."
1.0,"Mine...clip broke after 2nd day, trying to put it on and snap."
1.0,"They are really cute, but they rust within 2 days. And break easy."
1.0,So small an adult head couldnt fit through it
1.0,Description says stainless steel. I received girl volleyball player with disk and I❤️Volleyball key chain for my stepdaughter. Who just made volleyball team for school. I bought as a surprise. And as to my surprise it’s copper charms. Stainless rings only. I work in the jewelry industry and thought I would polish off the pink color. And white platting came completely off. Yup it’s copper. So $15 on copper. Not sure if I can send back cause I laser welded the charm rings closed and polished it. Pink color was already showing through. I’m very disappointed in this junk. Will not recommend lies...! 1 Star for receiving package in timely fashion. I will update review as I try to exchange or return.
1.0,Ring is very tiny and doesn’t look like a cat.
1.0,"LOVE IT AND THE VIBRANT COLOR. It's very stretchy...I wear a small to a medium normally but all they had was the XS, so I went with it since it's free return. And I'm glad I did. Great buy!! I'll wear it like a turtle neck/ undershirt. It's very comfortable and the velvet black patches are so cool and soft! It is mesh like material and slightly see thru. I think almost any size you get will fit....<br />UPDATE!!!! After wearing it for 3 hours the black fuzz started coming off. Returning it.  I'm truly sad to say because I loved it.<br /><br />For the blue I bought the XL going by the chart and it's big"
1.0,"My daughter wears a 3T in most clothing. This 3T fit like a very tight glove. Plus, my poor toddler looked like Evel Knievel. 🤣 It wasn’t a good look, needless to say. The return was super easy."
1.0,"I was so excited to purchase this shirt. I thought it would be fun to wear, especially at work. I ordered xxl to be sure it was big enough. The cut of women's shirts tend to make them run small. I washed the shirt, like I do all new clothes, it is now closer to a large or medium shirt. I understand that certain materials shrink but that much?"
1.0,"Wore this swimsuit for 4 swim lessons and as soon as I washed it , the wore off color . Have attached pictures for reference"
1.0,This product was cheaply made and was sized poorly.  Large was definitely not large
1.0,Look nothing like the picture.. it’s more likely a baby shirt
1.0,"The lace trim around the neck is very ugly and not fitted, sticks up around neck"
1.0,Wore one time color change not of good quality
1.0,This product showed up as an unmatched pair. I’m not sure what happened here but it looks like I have one anklet and one foot chain. They fit poorly and slide around when you put your foot down - you know like to use them while walking. How else are you supposed to use these? I’m so confused...
1.0,"This sweater is cute however save your money.  It shrinks up, rides up constantly."
1.0,too big and clunky!
1.0,Poor quality.  Would not recommend
1.0,"Not what I expected! Soo small, not what I saw in the picture when I bought it, can't hardly see the inscription 😳"
1.0,This was junk. It had very sharp edges and yellowed stones that weren't even glued in right. Returned
1.0,Not as we expected. Very flimsy and cap run big. A wasted of money
1.0,The product was cheap and not worth buying anymore. My daughter only wore it for 3days before it broke. I give this product 2 thumbs down 👎🏾👎🏾
1.0,The socks are very thin and there is one sock has a big hole on it.
1.0,"I really loved the fabric and love the colors but I'm 5' 7"" and its just too short.  Another thing I loved, the pockets! I didn't like, for me, it's too tight on my boobs and I'm sure going up a size with not fix it being too short and too tight."
1.0,I have to send back foot would not sleep into opening to small
1.0,Got a 1X and it was to small don't like it.
1.0,I put this flag up on August 25th and it already ripping.
1.0,"Must be Asian sizing because this dress was wayyyyy to small! Couldn't even get it on around my chest area. Material feels rough as well. I wanted to like it because in the picture the dress looks cute. Measurements 5'-6"" 150lbs 42D and got the XL."
1.0,"No lo recomiendo la verdad todas mis expectativas se fueron cuando lo recibí, no es hecho con hilo de buena calidad es corriente y lo peor es que llego lleno de pelo de algún animal parece de gato o perro, y sobre todo NO huele bien."
1.0,These are not shaped good unless they got messed up during delivery but it doesn’t sit I. Bf daughters head evenly very cute but a waste of money bc I’m not using them they keep falling off her head and if they are in her head only one ear is covered because of the way they are made
1.0,Very cute pants.... for a kid. The Asian imports strike again.
1.0,It’s basically swimsuit material. It’s stretchy silky and  clingy.
1.0,"I wish I could give this item a zero star. Putting it simply, it's a waste of money. I don't recommend it to anyone. Cheap (even for the price), doesn't look like the picture, wrong size, and tears. Don't bother."
1.0,"the watch did not work right. the second hand would not go past the other hands. unfortunately, i did not try it before my trip because it was dressier and i was waiting until i was dressed up.  now i find out i can't get a refund so i wasted my money."
1.0,Only one of my three pack was wearable. The other two had straps that weren’t sewed correctly. I’m a busy mom of three (with a newborn) so returning and doing all of that wasn’t worth it.
1.0,This dress was very small and see through. I usually wear a 10/12 and an xl.  The xl fit more like a medium.  With it being so tight it is also very see through.  I returned the dress.
1.0,2nd time purchasing this and broke again on the first day wearing it. Was cute for a few hours.
1.0,I recieved the wrong shirt.
1.0,I didn't expect these to be the best quality because they were so cheap and I only needed them for a Halloween costume. I would say they are &#34;dollar store&#34; quality. The top came frayed. They go just past the elbow. My biggest complaint is that they shipped from China and they took almost a whole month for them to come (No where was this advertised).
1.0,It does not tie on the side. Entire chest area exposed.
1.0,NOT true to size ordered an XL fit more like a medium/small.
1.0,The outfit is not how I pictured it I ordered a small I’m 5”2 110 and I was huge on me and the packaging was terrible 😞 I will be returning
1.0,"I dislike this item because the  the gold beads turned tarnish right away and not even after 10 minutes of wearing it the eye pedant broke on one side of the hooks so I could not wear it at all , don’t get me wrong the bracelet is pretty and all but not work the money for only 10 minutes of use 🤦🏻‍♀️"
1.0,"Love the socks, unfortunately, one pair has a HOLE.  These socks are bit pricey to arrive with holes in them. Hopefully a replacement will arrive or I will need to return them all."
1.0,"Horrible tights. Unfortunately I’m out of the return window by one day due to travel. Can see all the lumps and bumps while wearing it including underwear lines, I felt very conscious of my body when I went out for a walk. Material is ok, quite thin but fairly warm. Overall, very unhappy with the purchase."
1.0,Hooks don’t close so the masks can easily slip through. Bad material. Hooks come of the lanyard too.
1.0,gaudy
1.0,They rip too easily since the slot that the tab goes into for adjusting the size goes all the way to the edge.  Had to tape them all together.
1.0,"Picked one up from Homedepot for $50. Cheap- really cheap quality. It took off real fast - and came down equally fast. After 2-3 min of jittery flight, wouldn't take off. Recharged the battery. Flew less than a min before giving up again. Imported small video clips - didn't like the quality. Will return ASAP."
1.0,"Get what you pay for. Flimsy, but a good knock around change"
1.0,Shoes were made poorly. Not a boot for outside wear. Maybe alright for indoor wear only. Wasn’t satisfied at all.
1.0,SCAMER
1.0,This was so small that I couldn’t even wear it when I wasn’t pregnant. I’m five months postpartum now and back to my post pregnancy size which is a size small and this is still too small. It’s made for a child. Very disappointed
1.0,"Looked awesome on the site. I was excited when  I received them. but as soon as I opened the case they come in, I saw that one of the lens had fallen off the glasses. needless to say that was a big letdown."
1.0,"I've received the wrong color and style. I've ordered the cobalt blue color, but received the purple one. Also the cardigan I received doesn't have any buttons."
1.0,I wear a US size 10 in women. I ordered a large These socks run big and are not true to size
1.0,"Compression, where? Fits like a tee shirt with thin loose spandex."
1.0,These hats are extremely small.  Like for kids 5 years old small.
1.0,"This is not an original product for Seiko Sportura braclet. I receive, not the real one."
1.0,Got a reaction from wearing this ring. Whole finger and hand swelled up.
1.0,Waaaay to small
1.0,In this product description it said 90%cotton and there was no cotton at all!
1.0,didn't seem to help.
1.0,"Has no room for tightening, no stretch."
1.0,Looked nice really liked it but only had it for a month and stone fell out already...very cheap ring
1.0,"I like that these come in a 3 pack. However  they are very very short on the stem and will be ripped out of your nose with the slightest tug. Painful indeed, i lost 1 due to this. Was simply putting on a shirt and got pulled out.😣😢"
1.0,Christmas present that went wrong. Half the charms fell off week 1
1.0,La tela es de mala calidad y muy cara no se aprovechen de las personas el dinero cuesta
1.0,Horrible!.0 stars..
1.0,"Shouldn’t an extra large fit, I realize these are made for super models, but some women aren’t that fortunate."
1.0,I returned this item. The pattern was completely different than what is on the picture.
1.0,"The seams ripped with normal wear. Also, the buttons are not centered correctly."
1.0,it runs extremely small.
1.0,Too small and the width is too thick for my nose.
1.0,I even ordered several times to hope they would fit.  Just NOT a well made shoe....
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,Very slippery and slips off my heels. Knew it wasn't going to be good right away so I went to return it and it says they're not eligible for return. Lame.
1.0,This was a gift for my son he has wore them Spence they were delivered today he noticed the left shoe is coming apart at the soul I now have to buy another pair my son is in work release and he really needs these boots the box they came in was thrown away can I use the new box to send them back
1.0,"Super cheap/poor quality.  The material is see through, the pockets can be seen. The feel of material is awful. Too long! Must return it."
1.0,I absolutely loved these leggings. They were squat proof & overall extremely comfortable. Unfortunately they ripped today in the crotch & I'm really upset I had planned on ordering another pair but now I'm not so sure. I'm not too sure if this seller even accepts returns so keep that in mind when purchasing.
1.0,Lasted 6 weeks and the strap pulled apart and the metal is discolored
1.0,Cute bracelet but it broke the second time it was worn and fell off somewhere.
1.0,"NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE OR AS EXPLAINED!!!!<br />The pants don’t even come to my ankles, it’s thin, nor flattering at all & the “belt” is like a ribbon not a belt at all & is not help in place by anything.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,"The bottoms fit fine, but the top was too small. I wear DDD and it just barely fit. Ended up returning it."
1.0,Keeps time poorly and fits awfully.
1.0,As soon as I opened the package I could see extremely thin chain it was attached to had already been stretched and broken before I even got it out the packaging.
1.0,"This thing fell apart with 3 uses. I am not hard on my necklaces, it was just poorly made. Now I have to fix it."
1.0,I love the design but when the shirt gets washed the shirt shrinks. So to short for me to wear now. I got a large but these shirts not nit reg shirts.
1.0,It looks like two right shoes when u look down at them.  Poor quality
1.0,Looks nothing like the pic. It looks like a mini a line dress. Not a T- Shirt dress.... looks horrible then I can't even return it because I would have to pay for the return fee. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,I have ordered 5 of these dresses. The first 3 in the ivory color came as ivory. The next two I ordered in ivory came as a soft pink. Super frustrating.
1.0,I ordered an XL. It is so small<br />My friend who wears a small or extra small even sometimes cannot wear it.
1.0,"I purchased another one of their skirts, the coral, and FELL IN LOVE. So much so I wanted one in every color. So I ordered this purple one. And much to my dismay, it arrived and was TINY in comparison. The elastic band was thinner, the dress was not a large in comparison to the other large of the same brand but was more like an extra small. As well as the tag was different (same name, different style tag). Overall I was highly disappointed especially for the overall cost. The fabric is heavy and of quality, but if sizing isn't consistent then how am I to order any others and trust that I'm not wasting my time and money? Truly bummed. Especially given the color of the purple is so unique."
1.0,"Bought from this brand based on great satisfaction from an older pair from over 5 years ago.. apparently the company has changed its quality and manufacturing process ,. Glasses came with lens cracked at the frame in 4 places,, tried to return, they wanted to charge me for shipping and the reimbursement would be only 2/3 of what I paid. So I kept, and watched as the lens got scratched up like no other glasses I’ve owned,,<br />Super cheaply made in China , overpriced garbage.<br />Glasses broke after a couple weeks when they hit the ground once.<br />Will not buy from this company again."
1.0,Returned it. It looked too cheap. The chain looks cheap.
1.0,Recieved it today. On time. But... the engagement ring was missing a stud on each side of the band...
1.0,It’s huge and not flattering. That was the medium
1.0,"The seam hit too low & there was hardly any color on the bottom at all. Sent it back, got a refund quickly."
1.0,El pedido nunca llegó y me lo cobraron
1.0,Very bad quality i dont recommened
1.0,These are the worse thing in the sunglasses world.
1.0,these are extremely cheap and not worth buying. these are the others I purchased and need you to resolve this issue
1.0,"These turned my fingers green within 5 minutes , just wanted them for a fairy costplay but couldn’t stand them long enough. So sad"
1.0,Awful quality and the XS was HUGE!
1.0,"Very disappointed with this jacket. The &#34;leather&#34; is already flaking off after wearing it only twice and the pockets have holes in them. It is poor quality and not worth the price. It fits good and looks great, but poorly constructed and already falling apart."
1.0,So when I got the product it didn’t even work and doesn’t light up
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress! The arms and chest area fit great... but for some reason the back is shorter than the front, enough to where its unwearbable. I thought I could just turn it around, but it is just an awkward fit like that. Im so bummed."
1.0,Low material quality. Started showing serious wear in the butt area after 2 days spent at the pool.
1.0,"This dress is terrible!  The fabric is very thick, heavy polyester—translation:  HOT and uncomfortable.  It fit weirdly, and the fabric is really just awful.  I returned it immediately.  Even if it had fit perfectly, I still would have returned it because of the awful fabric!  I definitely do NOT recommend this product to ANYONE!"
1.0,"QUE FALTA D EINFORMACION, NO HAY COMO TENER MEJOR CONTACO, NUNCA ME LLEGO MI PEDIDO Y QUEDE ESTAFADA"
1.0,Was definitely not a 5xl size like advertising or tag says.
1.0,These things were tiny. I couldn’t even slip my foot in.
1.0,If I could give this zero stars I would. Looks like nothing like the photos. The material was like a dollar store table cloth. Went straight to the trash.
1.0,No sizes were offered
1.0,"Very cute, but it turned during the 1st wear! Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Worthless.  It is so thin, that it looks awful with anything.  I would not purchase this belt ever again."
1.0,Very disappointed ... This looks like and feels like something you would get out of a gumball machine. I've tried polishing it with a microfiber cloth to remove the discoloration but I've had no luck! Thinking about returning it.
1.0,Too small!  I wear a large size 10....
1.0,Too short and too tight.  Waist is tight. Order two sizes up. They were short too and I’m already short. One pair looked like it was returned once already. It had an extra zipper pull attached onto the existing one.
1.0,"Comparing the information of Amazon, it is very small."
1.0,"Fighting Hawks was voted on as the new nickname. As a UND alum I'm disappointed in this type of response. I can't say I'm a big fan of the new nickname, but this shirt is childish and disrespectful to current students and athletes. This isn't going to do anything except incite bitterness and division. Try using your grown-up words and try to get over a school nickname that is not coming back, no matter how many temper tantrums you throw.<br /><br />Again, the current students and athletes are the ones you are punishing but they are NOT the ones responsible for the old nickname being retired."
1.0,Good material poor style
1.0,Too plain on top and badly hemmed. Returned
1.0,"They are all uneven.  YES THEY ARE. Some are sort of close to the calf, most are crew length. My husband wears a 14 shoe. tried to wear them for his work boots. When washed all the elastic disappeared. Wouldn't stay up, couldn't just pick a pair you had to match up the short and the longer.. DO NOT BUY THESE SOCKS. My husband was cussing every morning...  Gold Toe over the calf... Worth every penny."
1.0,Photo makes it seem like it's a cotton type fabric with the pattern embroidered - it's all just printed on the cheap fabric that most shirts from China seem to be made of
1.0,"I’m really disappointed on this product, it looks completely different from the picture that is on here.<br />The design or print of the dragon is not sharp, & not at all the color that I saw online. It’s red on here, but the dragon is orange, the one I just got.<br />This shirt was for my son."
1.0,It should come in an xs.
1.0,"Why is the women's version of this jacket more like a sweater?  Note the sleeves...Same price as men's but not weatherproof except on front of body.  I get tired of manufacturer's ripping women off and going for ""style"" as opposed to function.  When I want a jacket, I want a jacket, not a sweater"
1.0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. OUTFIT FITS HORRIBLE AND RETURNS ARE A NIGHTMARE
1.0,"I bought the five pack shirts for my grandson, he wore it to school, when he came home it had snags in a couple of places, I thought he is a pretty rough kid and didn't think much about it.  The next day he wore another one, the teacher called me to bring him another shirt, because as you can see in the picture it was snagged everywhere.  I was very disappointed."
1.0,This case has a horrible smell! It is nauseating and I have tried everything to lessen the smell. I tried using the case several times but between the rubber falling off all the time and the smell it's useless.
1.0,Very poorly made. This is the second one I bought and didn’t have it two days and it broke in half. Junk
1.0,"Really cute but cheaply made, fell apart the first day that I wore it...."
1.0,The pins did not fit (too big). I had to remove and use the pins that came with the watches original band. It was honestly too much of a fight and I just put the original band back on.
1.0,Disappointing to get caps of the Cubs that don't fit that well and are flimsy. Most caps I have bought have some support inside. These cheaply made caps are not worth the money it cost me. I am a very disappointed customer.
1.0,Don't get it<br />It came extremely late
1.0,"I’m a size 8 women’s so ordered small. Fits way too big and the toe box is super baggy- so much so that the material bunches and causes blisters on my pinkie toes. I have to adjust the toe boxes through the day. Also, material makes my feet sweat. All around horrible socks. Throwing away."
1.0,"Definitely not a ""compression"" tank as stated very thin  but comfy as a tank top"
1.0,Shirts are very small. Order an XL and it is probably a medium. Gave it away.
1.0,Way to small and I got 2XL and I’m a size 14 in women’s. I usually only get an XL
1.0,It's so big I tried making it work because it's a cute hat but it just kept falling forward and I couldn't see. The front of the hat looked weird I guess the way it was made...? I Was expecting better but with that price it was too good to be true...
1.0,This is the ugliest shirt ever.  It is square and huge (and I'm a big girl). I purchased 2 of these on clearance for $5 each and didn't return them because the seller wanted $5 shipping fee to return it.  I ended up using them as smocks in my classroom.
1.0,Earrings were not good. Cannot wear them again made my ears puss.
1.0,Watch band keeps coming apart
1.0,"No! It is very light which I like, BUT it broke very quickly."
1.0,"Put them in the shoes, took 5 steps and took them out. The arch is so pronounced it gets painful."
1.0,Very disappointed in the product.  It looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Sleeve too short
1.0,"cheaply made as reflected in the price, flimsy, no foot sole/arch support, more of a slipper than a boot"
1.0,they were a bit too big/ the hem was pulled as it was sewn and will not lay flat/ I have washed them in hopes the hem would lie down/ no luck
1.0,I’m sending the necklaces back. One was missing an eye.
1.0,My writing on my shirt is wrong. And 'it' is spelled 'ti' on the shirt and none of the letters look like actual letters...just very loose cursive. There was no button for them to exchange it out for one that is correct and they didn't have the color I bought either...so I kept it and hopefully can get a friend to fix it. I ordered the smallest plus size and it's fit like an average medium but there is no stretch to it. I'd recommend sizing up.
1.0,"This bracelet was one of the cheapest looking pieces of jewelry I have seen in a while. I bought it for my dad to give to my mother for Christmas as she loves elephant jewelry. It looked so cute in the picture!<br /><br />It arrived in a small envelope inside a ziploc baggie with the invoice wrapped around it for packing material. That presentation was my first clue.<br /><br />The bracelet was lightweight, looked like it was molded from aluminum foil, and worst of all the links did not even lie flat on the wrist. They kinked up in every direction. Needless to say, I returned it. (After Amazon sent me an email saying they were ""requesting if this item was eligible for return."")<br /><br />Poor value for money."
1.0,I would love these...if the print wasn't UPSIDE DOWN! That's just stupid.
1.0,I HATE when I get something other than what I ordered. These are NOT PILLOW PAWS socks. DO NOT ORDER. I am returning.
1.0,There is absolutely no way this should be advertised for a D cup. This might fit a B. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I honestly cannot understand this dress. I ordered this thinking it would be a nice, bright casual dress to add to my summer wardrobe. When it arrived, I was shocked to see that it is made of an extremely thin material. The dress is much more sheer than expected and will show every lump and bump on your body. I seriously don't know how you could wear this out, I feel so exposed in it. The color is nice and as pictured but overall the dress is unflattering and frankly, unwearable."
1.0,"More cheap Chinese junk, sure does not look or feel like leather to me"
1.0,This skirt is way too small . It will fit only women with 26 inchs waist .
1.0,Broke taking the screw back ends off. Never even got to wear. Actually very angry at this product. DO NOT BUY! VERY CHEAP.
1.0,"The dress was too big, and the picture on the dress is upside down. I was very disappointed."
1.0,"These were comedically short, barely came past my elbow. Returned them right away. Super dissapointed."
1.0,"Never actually worked, fit or stayed in."
1.0,Feel like I got what I paid for..
1.0,Sending in for warranty
1.0,"Once you cut the plastic, the gem cannot be rethread on. Essentially, these are useless if you need to cut down the size; they come so long, I don't see how anyone could wear it at the normal length."
1.0,NADA SIMILAR A LA FOTO
1.0,Very odd fit. I’m tall and the top was too long and tight at the hips.
1.0,"Went up a size n still WAY TO SMALL, my daughter is a small n the XXL was tightn her NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL"
1.0,"Put a pair on then finished regular hair/make-up routine, by the time I went to put my shoes on (15-20 mins later) the heels were worn. No way they would have made it through being worn in shoes all day. Super disappointing bc they are cute. The ones I bought at Nordstrom hold up so I know it's possible. These just didn't have the strength."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money! The quality it poor, I couldn’t change the time to an accurate timeframe, the watch doesn’t have great battery life. It was just a waste! Another item that looks pretty but doesn’t deliver!"
1.0,"Not real turquoise,  just plastic,  to big"
1.0,"Don't waste your money. The fit is beyond weird and I'm almost 5'4, & 119 pounds.<br />I love my shirts long but this one is long, with an obnoxiously long slit on both sides. Normally everything I buy from Amazon I absolutely love. However, this shirt is horrendous."
1.0,This dress did not come as  expected extremely scratchy zipper was broken holes everywhere and it wasn’t very pleasant sprinkles everywhere from far beautiful but I guess you get what you pay for . I will be returning
1.0,Thought they were for children. Too BIG! Took way way way to long to deliver. I canceled when I realized I would not have them in time for a gift.
1.0,I ordered this despite the reviews and they were right. As soon as I put my cards in they started sliding out so I had to put them in the zippered pocket. It's cute if you want to do that. But if not don't waste your money.
1.0,I ordered 4 all black silk masks and I got these horrible multicolor masks? They have the weirdest folding pattern so they look like a duck mask and they’re so scratchy. I got silk because I have very sensitive skin and needed something soft- this is the opposite of what I want!!
1.0,The size was totally wrong. Waste of money.
1.0,no shape to the dress.
1.0,Too long and poor quality fabric
1.0,Snaps rusted and broke onlly wear when going out
1.0,I’m thoroughly disappointed in this hat. I purchased as a gift and it arrived in a box but it was all distorted. It won’t hold proper form now.
1.0,Why smaller than it says
1.0,Very small to size.
1.0,Pants split from crotch to knee first day. Hood is starting to separate from jacket.
1.0,Like the bracelet but poor quality. Every bracelet broke within one to two times of using...
1.0,Expect only to wear once unless you plan on never washing them! I am so disappointed in the quality and that my daughter only got to wear these one time!
1.0,"the glasses were too small, not mens sizeing at all.  it was made for a teenager"
1.0,"Cannot use it, I now have to return it."
1.0,I’m not sure it would even fit a child
1.0,definitely no stretch waist
1.0,Do not purchase.  I’m 5’7” 150lbs. I ordered a large and it fit short and right. The fabric is so bad. The patches are so horrible and cheap. It is not the same item as the picture by any means.
1.0,"One earring is smaller than the other, not noticeable when in my ears so I’ll keep them. Because of their sloppy quality control, I will never order from this company again."
1.0,I didn't order this . It's still in my shopping cart
1.0,Put in the refrigerator to scare whoever opened it but it never worked. Waste of money so threw in the garbage.
1.0,cute but not true to size
1.0,Picture was deceiving. Product was miniature version of what I was expecting . Not worth the price at all
1.0,I ordered an xl I’m typically a medium or large in swimwear and I couldn’t get it up my thighs.
1.0,terrible ring tarnished after a day and the stone fell out too.
1.0,Pants do not stay up at all. Will not purchase from this seller again.
1.0,Product seems good. But received wrong size twice.
1.0,"The clips on the blue earrings broke immediately when I tried to open them and put them on my daughter’s ears.  The stones fell off the pink shoes day two.  Doesn’t seem like this is going to last long, can’t find any way to contact seller or I would have done that before posting this review to give them the opportunity to address our issues."
1.0,Seems cheap. I returned them
1.0,These earrings are not as pictured. They are horrible looking.
1.0,"They are too small.  I had to cut it and extend the headband with elastic.  Don't understand why they can't make it a little bigger.  Nice colors though, just small."
1.0,"Absolutely way too small. I wear a 36C and typically order large and this large fit like a small. Even my husband said “you’d need a xxl to hold your boobs in with that”. Size up at least one, probably two. Also didn’t love the material."
1.0,"Not an attractive dress, awful quality and not how it looks in the image. It did fit as expected, but not worth the cost."
1.0,It fits extremely small. Had to give it away.
1.0,Cheaply made dress. The pockets appear to be sewn on backwards. The lining of the pockets stick out making your hips look big. I should have listened to the negative reviews. Returning.
1.0,I bought several from your store.<br />When they arrived they were soft and looked nice.<br />After a couple of washes they faded so bad they looked 10 yrs old.  And they felt terrible they are full of fuzz balls that feel terrible on the skin.<br />I can’t ware them they are so ruff to my skin.  I want my money back I have to buy all new gowns now to replace these.<br />Please send me a label and I will will send products  back.<br />I am disgusted with these gowns.  I spent a lot of money and these gowns are horrible after a couple of washes.<br />I do NOT a recommend anyone buy these.
1.0,face fell off now i have to super glue it. Fell off after 1 day very cheap. comfy ring easy to adjust but broke right away
1.0,It's very unflattering if you have a large bust. You have to size way up for the top which makes the bottoms way too big.
1.0,Beautiful mask but it broke at the top. Brought this for a masquerade ball party and got a lot of compliments from it but it didn’t last the whole night. Very disappointed.
1.0,Wanted tiny shorts but still way too small. Couldn't button and ordered a large. I wear a size 6
1.0,They do not show them in comparison to anything to show how tiny.  I would have returned but my mother likes small earrings and wanted them.
1.0,Worst choice hook dropped off the same day I receive it
1.0,Piece of crap! Broke within first 15 minutes of wearing it!
1.0,"While the size was accurate, the V “neck” extended beyond the waist and to my belly button. Additionally, the material is completely see through and the hem was falling apart. Unfortunately because of the incredibly low front slit, I am unable to wear a slip under to balance out the sheerness of the fabric. I do not recommend this dress, unless you are expecting close to full front exposure. It may be very cute as a beach cover up with a bathing suit under it, however."
1.0,Junk broke after 7 months and now I have to buy a new one
1.0,I ordered a large and got a 5x. It was ridiculously short. Even a large would have been a belly shirt…
1.0,This jacket shoulders are cut too shallow and it runs very small.
1.0,Not true to size at all about three sizes smaller than listed
1.0,"The advertisement did not match the product. The beeds were bright yellow and very uniform. It looked like cheap plastic beads, not stones or natural looking."
1.0,incomplete.NO CARE INSTRUCTIONS THIS PICTURE SHOW 3 ITEMS I GET ONLY 2 AND ONE OF THE BEATS OUT OF PLACE..
1.0,Broke first day. After it would not program.
1.0,Small at bottom perimeter of jacket.  Had a terrible formaldehyde Oder!  Caution!
1.0,"The shoe itself was cute.  My 4 year old daughter loved them.  Unfortunately, they must have been defective because one of the elastic laces snapped and cannot be repaired."
1.0,Not real gold and cheap looking
1.0,so small you need a magnifying glass to see it
1.0,These socks are such a ripoff. They didn't keep my feet warm or dry while we were camping.
1.0,"Its very long which is not shown in the picture. And fuzzy in the inside, which is too hot to dance in"
1.0,"I'm sending this back. The material is cheap, the zipper pulls come off in my hand with one use, and one pocket doesn't even have a zipper pull so I can't get the pocket open."
1.0,"The fabric felt like paper, and didn't fit correctly."
1.0,"I loved the ring and it fit perfectly when I first got it. However, not long after wearing it I noticed the silver changing color and leaving color around my finger. I was very disappointed."
1.0,The product doesn't fit like described.<br />Won't click in. Not recommended for fit bit luxe..
1.0,"Not true to size, runs too small"
1.0,My daughter wore these shoes a couple of times before the Mini USB wires broke on one shoe. After reading more reviews with similar mini USB  issues I wanted to reach out to the seller. That is not an option unfortunately. There is no one to speak to about options for replacement or repair.  For this reason alone I say don't buy.
1.0,"Very pretty, but buyer BEWARE! It was listed below $50 so I was going to purchase another one. Two days later it was listed at over $2,000!!!!!  Something seems fishy."
1.0,No sirve se puso de otro color muy rápido
1.0,"Item was so small, I would not recommend ordering your normal size.. It would have to be 5 sizes or more too small. :("
1.0,Didn't like the fabric to small a fit
1.0,Do NOT buy if you are looking to replace your Suunto Spartan watch! This is inaccurately advertised to replace the Spartan watch.
1.0,"I order this face mask a few weeks ago thinking that I can get it before school starts . Last night I received a message telling me that my package was lost .Yo ordene estas máscaras hace varias semanas pensando que podrían llegar antes de que las clases comenzaran ,anoche recibí un mensaje que mi paquete esta perdido y mi hijo comienza clases mañana!"
1.0,"If you are a large or smaller, you can order this xxl and it should fit like the picture. If you are bigger than a large please don't bother buying it even though it's cute in the picture."
1.0,"These are NOT yoga pants, they are pajamas like Walmart sells! Won't return because too much on shipping. Very disappointed but can always use new PJ's."
1.0,"It camp from China, so it took about two months to arrive, and when I wore it, it  immediately (a few days) turned to rust...not tarnished, rust. Being that I don't purchase products from China normally, I'm not surprised and I should've known."
1.0,Watch looks okay ...simply doesn't keep correct time
1.0,It’s too big I order small and it fit me like Large !! I was gonna return the product but it’s just waste of my time !
1.0,Se ve muy lindo puesto pero desde el primer día la bolita rosca se me cayo por q no ajustaba y al tercer día paso esto... se desprendió el colgante.<br />Tal vez no tuve suerte 🤔
1.0,Shrunk to Barbie size after the 1st hand washing and line dry.
1.0,"Material is very very very cheap, it almost looks and feels like a Halloween costume looks and feels, I’ve had better quality clothing purchased from Walmart for cheaper!!"
1.0,"Look longer on pictures,but love the pattern"
1.0,So impossibly small it was comical
1.0,All three of the belt clips broke loose within the first week of use. They are no longer usable. I wouldn't suggest you purchase these for everyday use. The materials are heavy duty but they are not put together correctly so they fall apart easily.
1.0,"I purchased these gloves for the sole reason of wanting to keep my hands warm when I am outside with the dogs. I can't speak to the waterproof claim but I was just outside in 26 ℉ weather and within five minutes my fingers were completely frozen and felt as if I had no gloves on them. So much for the -30 ℉ promise! I also can't speak to the touch screen claim because I don't think I could bend my fingers to comfortably type on my phone with these on. Based on the measurements, I needed a large for my finger length and a small for my hand size so I went with a large and that size was long enough. I'm glad to have a decent pair of gloves but I'm kind of sad and disappointed that they just don't keep my hands warm."
1.0,Do not buy this I wore it for a week maybe and was taking it off and the metal piece broke that you have to use to get it to hook on the watch this product is a piece of crap
1.0,"I was going to return this item as the top was really large and the bottom a little snug, but I kept it in hopes of altering the top. It a nice suit but the size is totally off."
1.0,Product had very little gold and some silver.
1.0,This is so tiny you can barely see it and I would not call it a charm. It did not come with a ring to attach it to a charm bracelet and no area t put a ring. I do not recommend it.
1.0,Can I give no stars? This arrived broken and was daughter was crushed. I was hoping it was better because of the 4.5 stars. Wouldn't buy again :(
1.0,the dress looks a lot different than in person
1.0,The rainbow stripe looks cheap and bad. Fit is ok but not super comfortable after a few hours.
1.0,Plastic not glass very disappointed
1.0,Material was very cheap looking and the fit was not flattering.
1.0,I ordered this dress for a cruise - it was huge and had barely any shape. I'm 5'1 and ordered a medium. It was HUGE and looked like a bag!
1.0,Horrible. The &#34;metal&#34; coloring was so chipped I'd be embarrassed to wear it in public.
1.0,"These are the tiniest pieces of facial jewelry I've ever seen. 2/6 pieces are useful to me, and I already have an identical piece to 1 of those 2! Going to return and look for something else."
1.0,The bottom was too small so I sent this back.
1.0,"Cute, but wouldn’t stay on my toddler’s face. However, the worst part is they are not scratch resistant AT ALL and were completely unusable less than 2 weeks into use because he could no longer see through the lenses. Cheap quality, wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,Not made well.  Zippers did not close completely.
1.0,Received item with 2 holes in it :/<br />Beautiful coloring and fits great though.
1.0,The quality was terrible  and there's a half a design on the back and fit small.
1.0,The bands was way to long
1.0,Faded after one wash. I threw it away. Hated it.
1.0,These are the worse socks I have ever owned.  There is no silicone on the heel to keep them in place and they slide inside my shoe within minutes of having them on.  I'm so sorry that I bought them.
1.0,Amazon recommended me get a medium I should have ordered small.
1.0,"El artículo no llegó a destino, me enviaron un sobre vacío."
1.0,Material is as cheap as a trash bag. The neck guard is flimsy and leaves part of your neck uncovered  due to its button design. Do not rely on this to protect you from the sun.
1.0,Did not get the dress I ordered. Not even close to the same. I won’t order from DB MOON again.
1.0,I bought a small hoodie and it's not small at all.<br />It looks like a large sized hoodie.
1.0,Came stained and clearly used<br />Returned for full refund
1.0,They fit perfect the first time. Every use after they wouldn’t fit! They stretched out and were unusable
1.0,Wow!!!!! LOL
1.0,This is too big and not a good quality!
1.0,Nice but design was not as expected. Outer portion of hips were 3XL or larger - too much. Would fit someone with saddlebags weighing 300-400 lbs. Material was nice and comfortable.
1.0,The material was very uncomfortable.
1.0,Picture is so fragmented looks stupid. Waste of money.
1.0,Watch face fell off after couple weeks of light use
1.0,The bag was not what I was expecting. Poorly made. Cheap looking.
1.0,I returned this item three weeks ago and I’m still waiting for a refund.<br /><br />Reason for return: The gloves were massive. I’m a 6ft tall woman with large hands and my hands were swimming in these. Only buy if you have some meaty mitts.
1.0,"I’d give no stars, but not sure if I could do that. These are I’ll fitting, some were 2 left feet. I bought them for my yoga students. How embarrassing to give such a cheap item."
1.0,"I ordered a 4XL. The kimono was more like a small or medium. It is pretty, however. I would not recommend this product or company."
1.0,This was total garbage ! Don’t buy this crap! Nothing like picture and not suitable to even be used for our Halloween costumes! Totally disappointing and not at all what is pictured had to use a star which was only because I had to use one
1.0,Frustrated !!!! The color looked too different when compared to the picture on-line. I can't wear or give it to someone as a gift because the bracelet look awful.<br />Don't buy it.
1.0,The rose goldtone rubbed off immediately! I wore it 3 times and ended up throwing it away. Not worth a dime!
1.0,Kids size seem to run small.
1.0,I should have checked the details but these are not leather and not even a good PU
1.0,The slippers make a loud squeaking noise as you walk.  Something wrong with the sole material.
1.0,I’m 5’3’’ so me saying a it’s too short is rare. But this Top was VERY SHORT. Came to belly button. Kinda tight in the arms/shoulders. I bought a large.
1.0,I dropped it and it broke into two pieces.
1.0,Sweeter came in a Air tight  bag<br />Full of wrinkles can not get out<br />Very disappointed
1.0,"This product was okay but I did not love the color of it. Also, the fabric was not comfortable. I would recommend sizing up if you do buy it."
1.0,"I am not satisfied with this product, it's already changing colour and i've literally just received it."
1.0,This necklace looks good but I received a broken necklace which has a &#34;No return policy&#34;. I hope I CAN GET A FULL REFUND inspire of their policy.
1.0,"I'm writing this here becuase I wasn't sure where else to write this.<br />Route Package Protection auto Charge:<br />When I received my order confirmation email I saw that there was an additional ""route package protection"" charge on the order. When I went back to the website and simulated a purchase I saw that there was a tiny toggle, the default of which was set to on, which added ""route package protection"" fees. You have to explicitely specify that you do not want the charge, and if you do nothing you are charged. That in my mind is a scammy thing to do.<br /><br />Bras:<br />The one bra was stiff and overengineered but provided no padding or protection.<br />The other bra was ok. The cup size was too small, but I will not go through the hassle of an exchange as can be seen with my costumer support exchange below.<br /><br />Leggings: Due to their intense marketing and website I was excited to receive the leggings. I removed the tags as I was quite sure I was going to love them and tried them on. As soon as they were halfway up my legs I realized I'd made a horrible mistake, they didn't fit me at all. The upper portion of the leggings were stiffly shaped in an apple configuration. When I put them on there was a permamently shaped balloon like portion all around my mid-section which bulged outwards in 360 degress around my body.  The fabric was rough and itchy. I called customer service and received a voice mail. I left a voice mail. I messaged them on their website and received a stock response a few days later specifying that once tags are removed there is nothing they can do, I replied to the response email and received no reply. I called again and received a voice mailbox. I messaged them again a couple of days later and saw that they had automatically closed my ticket. I went to their support ticketing system website and left two notes in a ticket. I finally chatted with them and had the most unhelpful conversation. It was a serious waste of time. The operator was condescending, asking if I read the policy before trying them on and just repeating the policy. Once tag removed, for any reason whatsoever, you cannot return or exchange the leggings.<br />I was resigned to just have to eat the $108 (plus taxes and fees) when a manager called me and we had a phone conversation. They agreed to return the leggings for store credit and a restocking fee of $25.<br /><br />Just be aware that this company has a very strict and hardline return policy. Be absolutely sure that you will love these before purchasing or returning."
1.0,Sizing is way off
1.0,I got a size larger than usual and my daughter who wears a size 0-2 can't even wear it! Unfortunately I washed them and can't return..but will not purchase anything from this company again!
1.0,One side lost its suction gasket rendering the goggles useless.  Get what you pay for I guess.

1.0,There to big for my face and they are to bulky worst sun glasses I every had and owned i
1.0,I have an average size head and this thing is wayyyy to tight to even wear comfortably so I gave it away to a girl I know. Save your money
1.0,Looks NOTHING like the picture in the ad.
1.0,Necklace came broke
1.0,I am appalled. This is honestly laughable. It was only 5 bucks so guess it’s on me for expecting something more than an unaligned print on a metal circle connected to a chain. Sorry for the dark photo.
1.0,looks good on the picture but in person its cheaply made and its suppose to be a large size and it fits very small and Im skinny!!!
1.0,Although these are super cute and great deal - they both busted with hardly any use - i purchased Feb 2019 and now April 2019 - so sad - wanted to order more - Hardly worn and im not rough with my glasses have many pairs for many years -
1.0,The glasses came scratched and are warping on one of the arms.
1.0,It had a run in it when I received it :(
1.0,ITs lil pinching the skin underarms because of the shimmer design or fabric
1.0,"Love the cause, but bracelet is garbage and fell apart within 2 days. The cord is too delicate and frays VERY easily."
1.0,"Fabric is stiff. Received pants, hat, no shirt."
1.0,"Took them out of the package.  When my wife tried them on, they ripped on both sides next to the seams.  They were the correct size, just poorly made. She was easily able to pull them up her legs."
1.0,"This is not anything like the picture. The back is just a flat piece of wood, no straps like the photo no curve to it going in, just a quarter inch piece of flat wood with some holes like that could be a handle. I was not expecting this to be real but i did want what was shown. This thing is way too heavy also and has no way to hang it which is all it is good for. Save your money."
1.0,It is not worth it. Do not buy.
1.0,Didn't meet my expectations and cost more then I thought
1.0,Soft fabric but shapeless. I am petite (5ft 100lbs) and the smallest size was huge on me!

1.0,Product not true to size
1.0,"I put these earrings in before work. Before I even got to work, 15 minutes away, one had fallen out. Now I have one earring and one missing earring. Not impressed"

1.0,I ordered a round scoop neck slit side shirt as pictured and I received a baggy  but very tight spandex very low cut v neck  that is neon red. Absolutely is not what is pictured. So upset and I don’t have time to return it and get something new. Very upset cheap and horribly made and not as pictured
1.0,Mine are very cheaply made. Brown film INCOMPLETE especially around the edges of the lenses. NOT WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR THEM.
1.0,"The black and pink leggings are SUPER sheer. The black leggings fit 2 sizes smaller than all the other colors. The purple are my FAVORITE. Super stretchy, squat proof, and make my booty POP. Do not recommend the black or pink."
1.0,Cheap stuff......🤬
1.0,Didn’t get a chance to wear….a number of the crystals  fell off during first hand washing.
1.0,"Very cheap quality. Also, they are flat. Like zero contour. Maybe that's desirable to some but not for me. I returned mine.<br />The color was really nice though."
1.0,Put them on and with in an hour I had rips from the seems by the pocket on one side. Won’t order from this place again
1.0,Not sized right!
1.0,I even bought a size larger and the waste was too tight.  I returned it.  Needed it for my up coming vacation.  Very disappointed.

1.0,Zero stars if I could! Feels like paper stay away don’t buy!
1.0,Cheaply made. Way too small. Gave it away to the local clothes closet. Not worth the hassle and expense of returning it.
1.0,Some of the jewels were off the earrings when they arrived and at bottom of bag. About 15.
1.0,I returned  the socks they were all nylon and so long they looked like girls kneesocks
1.0,That it’s not Speedo.
1.0,I had this bag for one day at work and he strap broke! I love how cute it is but the gold straps are made out of really cheap material.
1.0,"Cheap, thin and poor graphics<br />DEFINITELY will not purchase items like this on Amazon again"
1.0,Quality of the workmanship seemed okay but the sizing was WAY off...much too small!
1.0,Buckle constantly falls off
1.0,The material is more like pantyhose than leggings. Can only wear under a dress or a very long top.
1.0,When this arrived it Stunk so bad i couldnt use it.  total waste of money
1.0,"This is a dry clean outfit.  That would have been nice to know before I even bought it.  I dont dry clean things, and it was washed before I saw that and already too small for my son."
1.0,After one day of wearing the bracelet the beads faded<br />It just looks like clear beads now doesnt look real gemstones at all . Not worth it
1.0,Poor quality and ran about two sizes small had to send it back.
1.0,The watch pictured is not what was received .. also watch was not in a box as shown on pictures. Wish o could give zero stars
1.0,Much too small for sunglasses...only holds a small pair of regular glasses...a waste of money.
1.0,Not made for big boobs. This shirt fits like a tent! Returned.
1.0,star was bent forward
1.0,I ordered a new vest and received a new vest without any tags. So I’m sure it was a return that was sent back out. I would be ok with that if the item was listed as new without tags and priced as such. It was sold as new and I paid new pricing. I will rewrite my review of the take care of the issue. I’ll update as soon as I can.
1.0,Metal is very cheap - trying to return but have not way to send a photo - who knows what will happen.
1.0,"This bra is listed as a ""high impact"", but it is not at all. It is more of a yoga or leisure bra. Fits way too small in the band and too loose in the bust."
1.0,Garbage - worth $1.00
1.0,Broke after I wear it for 2 times
1.0,This band just broke after one wear.... I would of lost my watch if I wasn't paying attention
1.0,I did not like that it looked very cheap it was actually missing one of us that little fence and it took forever for me to get it
1.0,This shirt looks like someone just iron glued the A on a plain white shirt. The fabric is thin and cheap. There was nothing “Official” about it.
1.0,"This product is made of very cheap looking mesh material. I tried one on and it fit but I had ordered one size smaller than normal, so they are a bit on the larger side per size range. I cannot image the material or stitching holding up to a couple good workouts and a wash. I returned it for a different Neleus product, the runners dri-fit tops, which are much better and worth getting."
1.0,Not true to size. Not comfortable because of it. Love the color have one in black but got it from Target. Thought it would fit the same and it didn’t. Disappointed!
1.0,Purchased this for my 6yr old... my 4mo old nephew ended up using it. Extremely small!!!
1.0,These were made for a very slim person and the quality was not good.  The sequins started falling off as soon as I took it out of the package and even more so when I put them on.  Good for a costume on a slim person and maybe only for one use.
1.0,Never mentioned the pants are bell bottoms. I hate bell bottom scrubs! To return the item you needed to pay shipping and a restock fee. It wasn't even worth it to make the return.  Thumbs down!
1.0,Nose saddle is narrow- scratches the nose- no soft nasal clips<br />Tried to sand the area down - does not quiet work<br />Good for  the price otherwise
1.0,Ordered a 13 inch necklace. Got an 8 inch bracelet instead. Filed a complaint and have not heard anything since.

1.0,"I normally wear large, but bought x-large to ensure good fit. X-large was too short for me (I am 5'11"")."
1.0,zipper broke before I got on the plane. Very disappointed.
1.0,"LOVE the designs, but could not wear since it was so tight it gave me a headache.  If the loops were larger they’d be perfect.  Had so send mine back."
1.0,La talla esta muy reducida no es como las xxl normales parece talla L
1.0,"I bought this pocket watch and it was delivered Sunday September 4th, and the watch never worked. The battery is dead. Very disappointed. Will not buy again."
1.0,WAY too small.
1.0,What is the measurements of the actual cross?
1.0,"Very very small and short. Literally should have been labeled a child's medium.<br />This was either a wrong item sent or I got a defective made one I'm thinking.<br />Wouldn't close in front and didn't cover half my booty... it was a short,  not even a short dress...a shirt.  And a short shirt at that lol<br />Junk"
1.0,Dress was wway too small and not the quality expected.
1.0,I can literally see through this fabric. Also We purchased an XL for someone that wears a Large  and it way too small. The XL fits a small. The Decal is also very thick.
1.0,I normally wear a small or a medium in women's Is this sweatshirt fit by 9 year old perfectly weight way too small for me my 9 year old normally wear a size 10/12 youth boys. And I ordered this in a lazy large
1.0,"I like the bag but it is soft unlike many woven bags you see advertised. But I like the size and the fact that it has a zipper and inside pockets. However, there was no scarf enclosed as was advertised."
1.0,"This thing feels like a hair shirt, it's so rough and itchy.  I'd have to wear a fully long sleeve turtleneck underneath it (I was planning on wearing a tank) to make it even slightly feasible.  And it's small - I ordered a size up, hoping for a big poncho-like fit; I could barely get my arms through the sleeves and the sweater itself only came around to the sides of my chest - it didn't even make it to the front of my body.  And frankly, it was ugly - I guess that's a matter of personal preference but I was not preferring it.  Since I got it so cheap I'm just going to donate it instead of go through the hassle of sending it back, but I can guarantee I will never wear that thing."
1.0,"its not worth it for the prize, its not loud enough to scare people."
1.0,The description states that it's 100% cotton and it's not. It's polyester and it's so thin it's see-through. It also states that the sizes are in men's size and that too is false. I've contacted the seller for a refund and they aren't working with me. Highly disappointed and dissatisfied.
1.0,Masks fog up immediately after putting them on. Complete waste of money.
1.0,"Unfortunaley the blouse runs very small, so if you are a plus size, keep this in mind"
1.0,They look fake and don't fit the nose at all.
1.0,The glasses full out immediately no good very cheap but for the price they should actually be a lot better
1.0,This is extremely unsafe. I am begging amazon to restrict this item from being sold. Extremely unsafe. As soon as I plugged it in smoked
1.0,"Very cute shoe, but literally fell apart after four hours of wearing."
1.0,"The band links are hard to take off with the punch included. Plus, honestly, the band doesn’t look good to me vs the pics. Buyer remorse."
1.0,Not what I expected! This bra does not fit or lift my boobs! It was a waste of my MONEY!!
1.0,The fabric. Very cheap.
1.0,"Distressed was supposed to be Ivory but as you can see from the picture, clearly it is bright white. I needed it for a photoshoot and there was no time to return it. Very disappointed."
1.0,"This item is held together with hot glue. Before taking it out of the bag the ears fell off of the headband and  the elastic fell off the tail. Yes the elastic that is used to put the tail on your body is held on with glue, not sewn."
1.0,"so I have this kind of a rule that when something does not work as intended or is made incorrectly the best I can give it is two stars.  Thats the case here.<br /><br />The glasses I received look enough like the ones in the picture but were made incorrectly.  **You can see from the lined paper that the &#34;arm&#34; on the right side is attached to the frame lower than the arm on the other side.  I tried bending the frame at the bridge but could not get the sunglasses to look correct.  I've taken a picture of it on my face and it looks crooked... terrible.<br /><br />when viewed from other angles (as seen in the other photos) the sunglasses look cute enough.<br /><br />So, not a fan."
1.0,Was looking for a pretty keychain and it came in with a huge flaw.
1.0,This is not the case that I received.  It was a completely different cat on the case.
1.0,The post doesn't even go they my ear. Way too short. Waste of money.
1.0,Do not buy! Cheap as can be. Spend the extra money 💰 on a yoga one arm bra.
1.0,"Felt cheap, fit small and the skirt was way  too stiff.  Returned it"
1.0,Bra strap hooks broke after first wear! So I have strapless bras until I get some straps
1.0,Not good material; weird fit
1.0,These are weird colors that don’t go with anything.  I kept the black one and threw the rest away.  It was an unthinking purchase on my part.
1.0,This product does not look like the picture. It was too cropped and it felt cheap. Returned and would not recommend
1.0,They are way overpriced for h  oh w tiny they are.  Not sturdy.  Broke first time I wore them.  Junk buyer beware.  Do nit waste your money.
1.0,worst quality ever!
1.0,"Not even a week after beginning to wear this, gems started to come off left and right. I have had to reglue several gems on. Once a gem comes off all the ones around it start coming off as well. Very disappointing and not worth the money."
1.0,Shrunk the first time I washed it.  Basically spent $30 for a dress I only wore once.
1.0,This is the second time it has completely fallen apart. The first time happened about a month after i started using it. We put it back together using a cut up safety pin in lieu of the missing spring part and it worked for a while. But it just fell apart again a couple of days ago so I kinda gave up putting it back together. Im sure it's a great keychain. But there's always a bunk one in the batch and I got it this time.
1.0,Only giving it one star because there is not a zero star.  Horrible material and product picture is very deceiving.
1.0,Everything was terrible about this.
1.0,Not cute at all
1.0,Nothing what it looks like
1.0,"Super thin, silk like material. Keeps falling off while working out/moving around. Not pleased."
1.0,This broke after less than a month of my son wearing it.
1.0,If I could give it zero stars I would! Looks NOTHING like the picture and the sleeves stopped halfway down my arms. Stay away!
1.0,"I ordered small/medium and it was too small and tight around my arms. I normally wear small/medium in regular clothing. This fit like an x-small. Also, the color was definitely white and the dress does not look like the picture at all. Had to return..."
1.0,"Bad, bad product!!! Super small ... I'm usually a large, but because of other reviews saying that it ran small, I decided to buy an xx large...still didn't fit ☹️<br />It looks nothing like the pictures!"
1.0,"Unconfortable, too tight, unmanageable fabric. Too small, didn't fit,at all. Never buy it again."
1.0,Cheaply made.....bed sheet material
1.0,It doesn't look at all like what is shown in advertised pictures.
1.0,I ordered the blue beanie and was sent a grey beanie. Very thin and extremely small. Save your money.
1.0,It fits like a normal hat. But the queen logo is a cheap iron on decal. Not worth the money.
1.0,its very fake material.
1.0,This corset said it was steel boned but it is not. It is plastic boning with only the steel Hooks in the front. Size is completely off. Based on my measurements I should have gotten an XL. Bought a 2XL just in case and it was still too small. This wouldn’t be the biggest issue if it was really steel boned but it is not and I am extremely disappointed.
1.0,This necklace came in a small baggy so when it was taken out it had weird creases. It also has a strong order. Wish I could return it!!!
1.0,"I am large busted & their is not enough support from the shoulder straps as they are to long , plus you can see the out line of the pads."
1.0,"the smell was absolutely terrible, it's so bad that it made it unwearable. Also it will leave some blue mark on your skin after you take it off."
1.0,Does not reach to knee level..
1.0,"Really cute hat, unfortunately the rivets rest of the first time wearing out at the pool. The fit was good but the color staining around the rivets made it look dingy."
1.0,They tarnish fairly quickly if you wear them often. I will have to get a new set for my bridesmaids to wear on my wedding day.
1.0,I didn't like the fact that the dress was to small for my breasts. I bought the dress for Christmas and it didn't fit.
1.0,Dated looking and not flattering.
1.0,"Looked great out of the box, snapped into directly fit my Oakley's, however immediately had a Halo with oncoming headlights while driving (which some polarized lenses do, so not a huge deal to me) the problem and why I am giving a 1 star review is because after one time on the boat, I jumped in the bay ) saltwater if course) and the mirrored finish literally just wiped away."
1.0,Was hoping this design was small and on the side.  Nope!  It’s large and awkwardly located.  Disappointed!
1.0,In the mail came 6 rings and a few were very difficult to spin and one didn’t even spin at all. it would just slightly move side to side. disappointed.
1.0,"Not good quality at all. Crooked seams and the arm holes are so small, I could only get it past my wrist and I have pretty thin arms. Returning item."
1.0,Too big and very frumpy
1.0,xxl but fits like large.. definitely not for those of us with boobs. very thin low quality fabric. returning. bummer.
1.0,"I purchased an 8, but the label lists it an 8T. What the heck is an 8T??? It’s very small and short."
1.0,Too small. I ordered my usual size did not fit. The sweatshirt did not look as pictured. I feel it was misrepresented and I was very disappointed.
1.0,"Didn't like this keychain at all!!  Cheap, poorly made and not functional."
1.0,"Not at all what is pictured. The blue is a brighter color, not the navy blue as it is described. The pants are also made of a very cheap, thin material which were not worth the cost of the pants. The cute bow in the front was an additional strand that had to be weaved through the notches of the pants then tied. Overall, the pants need some adjustments but they werent a good fit for me. However, they may be enjoyable to others"
1.0,"These looked so cute online, but sadly they were so see thru I had to return them."
1.0,Dislike the quality. cheap and sized for a pre-teen
1.0,"Cheep, seethrou, and runs very very small..."
1.0,"I wear a size 7.5-8.  These are supposed to fit up to 8.5, but they are really short. They only barely cover my heel, and after a few steps, slip off.  Entirely useless."
1.0,"Obviously worn, poorly repackaged, did not look at all as pictured."
1.0,"Very pretty, but they broke in my hand the first time I wore them.unfortunately had to return them."
1.0,"I would give a five star, except for the fact that it’s MADE IN CHINA!"
1.0,"terrible belt, cheap defective,  contact seller got the run around, maybe someone living under a bridge would ware it, lost my money"
1.0,So wrong in many ways
1.0,The item was way too small.  I gave it to Goodwill.
1.0,Look good but doesn’t last more the a month
1.0,"Pretty sure my chickens are of ""standard"" size but this came no where close to fitting on my poor chicken... the design was cute though, and quality was good"
1.0,"I took a chance and bought this online instead of a leather shop. This leather feels cheap right out the box. It's thin and plasticky, and the inside feels like sand paper. Absolutely uncomfortable. Don't buy cheap. Especially leather."
1.0,"gave this as a gift, and it broke just putting it on. she liked the design of it but could not wear it. would not recommend this item or the seller."
1.0,Not true to size. Bought for a woman. Fit my child.
1.0,Cannot get it to sit right and it’s not attached to headband and just cannot get it to look like it should.
1.0,They came broken and very cheap
1.0,"I knew it would be low quality for the price, but it’s not even wearable. It’s literally the worse quality piece of clothing I’ve ever seen."
1.0,"The bracelets seem sturdy.  Unfortunately, I only got three instead of the six that were advertised.  With just three, they are not worth the cost."
1.0,"These leggings are extremely thin (think wind running right through them) and have no label to indicate which side is the front or back. On top of that it's hard to tell which side should be on the outside, you'll have to check the stitching."
1.0,Get one 2 times your size because it runs very small. I returned it.
1.0,I like the color but it is too small for me. I am a Asian and medium built. This dress is made for very small women
1.0,These don't have the elastic bands to keep them on your head. They have plastic sleeves with holes to adjust them on your head. This makes them uncomfortable and falls off. These will be okay for people in daily life going to the store but if you are a healthcare worker or healthcare students these are not the ones for you.
1.0,Did not screw in. One was broken.
1.0,"This is a very thin, slinky fabric. It looked much more structured in the picture but is very very bodycon..."
1.0,"I used this band to replace a nylon one and the bar end clips are different for those two bands.  I was able to make them work and I love the resin band simply because my watch won't stink anymore.  I ordered my second one after the first one broke, figuring I could just use the buy it again feature.  The picture above shows the watch band I wanted with the gap in the middle, but I got the other kind with the tongue in the middle. Now I have a watchband that I can't use and no watch to wear."
1.0,Cheaply made<br />Low quality<br />Fell apart out of the package
1.0,"I was hopeful. I was. The red and white striped and completely crooked where the blue meets the red/white stripes. Also, it’s huge. I’m usually a M/L. I ordered a Large. It’s gigantic. It’s so big it could be an actual flag at a used car dealership."
1.0,Not even close to what you show on line ............. The printing is way to light to read.
1.0,Cheap! Bad quality. Did not like it. I sent it back.
1.0,"not a good mask to wear, too heavy."
1.0,The sizes are not true to size order up
1.0,Awful. One of the beads was stripped right out of the packaging. Which is a bummer because it looks really cute.
1.0,Had to return them because they were too narrow
1.0,It was a fake product.
1.0,awful material and shape waist was to small then ballooned out at bottom bad purchase
1.0,Trash! Broke in 2 days! Total waste of my money.
1.0,When I ordered this I was expecting green not black and white. This looks like it was cut out of a black marble countertop. Disappointed and such a waste of money!!
1.0,This shoes are nice and everything however they are cheaply made ! The bottling part of the shoe is starting to fall off and you can see the glue coming off.
1.0,This material is see threw and the quality sucks .
1.0,Terrible quality rip so fast
1.0,Part of the reason you pay this price for children's shoes is because the package is irresistible. This was to be part of a birthday gift for my granddaughter but literally the box was torn at both sides and frankly looked like it had been soaked in water. Disappointed in product quality going out the door.
1.0,"Sloppy work, jewel in clasps is crooked and top of the nose stud is also bent. Does not look like the picture."
1.0,Snaps are not strong. It’s comes off the moment I roll my wrist.
1.0,Not made well at all.
1.0,I bought the the xxl and it runs at least two sizes smaller than all my other xxl cycling gear.
1.0,Shirt was ripped on BOTH sides...threading was WAY off....shirt was NOT properly made.
1.0,"These diapers are extremely cheap so this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations. The prints are adorable and the stitching is nice but the microfiber insert that is attached is horrible. The diaper isn't constructed in a way that allows for proper cleaning (an all in one should have a tongue style). I added cotton doublers to help with the fact the microfiber didn't hold anything and it just made the diaper huge and still leaked because it was pushing the diaper away from my baby's skin. It's a total waste of money - just invest a little more and go for some of the much much better brands out there! Thirsties and Bumgenius make excellent diapers that are trim and leak-free!"
1.0,Fabric ripped first day. Waste of money
1.0,"When I walk in them I feel like I'm going to fall, they are very uneven inside and very uncomfortable. Can't wear them."
1.0,It broke to quickly
1.0,Product fits 2 times smaller than it appears. Returning.
1.0,"I found these replacement thumbsticks to be fragile in two ways:<br /><br />1) The rigid plastic within the rubberized thumb pad broke within the first several uses, so that pressing the stick in one direction makes the pad flex and bend. This made the thumbstick more or less useless.<br />2) The texture of the rubberized grip wore off extremely quickly, leaving little black pieces of rubber all over the place."
1.0,Strangely large in the bust which is quite a feat considering I wear a 36H bra. It fit relatively well elsewhere and probably a couple of darts would have made the bust fit; but the tailoring would have cost more than the dress and it wasn't good enough quality to be worth it. Sent it back.
1.0,Band broke after only having for 1 month.
1.0,The sweatshirt arrived on-time and I was pleased with the product.  Unfortunately even an XXL was waaaaaay too small -- I normally wear a size 14 or 16 so it should've been nice & roomy.  Had to send it back for a refund.  :-(
1.0,It was nice while it lasted. The letter broke off within a week:(
1.0,This was not true to size. No stretch.  5'9 269lbs normally wear a stretchy 18 or 20
1.0,this broke on the first day I wore it the whole stem just fell out of the watch
1.0,Everything I have gone from Amazon has been great except for this item right here one of the worst things I've ever boughten
1.0,"The Russell brand has always stood for quality, but the sweatshirt began pilling after 2 washings (in cold water).<br />If I could return this item would, but the allotted time has passed."
1.0,Way over priced for the quality. This type of accessory would be worn just a few time and costs too much.
1.0,"They might be okay for the price, but the quality sucked overall. Got my mobile and wallet all wet in rain."
1.0,"I like the soft material. However, I would not recommend purchasing this item."
1.0,"This is a large, heavy (6.2oz), wrist watch. Not at all what I was hoping to find, but still I would have kept it if it was not obvious that this was both a used and/or returned previously, watch, and not properly assembled."
1.0,terrible material and fit
1.0,These are flat and very cheap. You have to curl your toes to keep them on your feet.
1.0,"Initially these slippers were extremely comfortable, but after wearing them indoors for just over 2 months (purchased on October 26 2016) the sole has come loose from the tip of the toes to the ball of the foot. They just didn't last, I had high hopes for these and am quite disappointed with the durability of these slippers. Kind of a let down."
1.0,Nothing compression about it.
1.0,I bought this dress to wear to a special event this weekend it shipped and was here within two days! However the dress with a wrinkled mess and had a huge hole in it right in the middle of the front. Not repairable! Now I don’t have a dress for my event.
1.0,Wasn’t as nice in appearance or as well made as I expected. Donated.
1.0,Lettering peels off easily and they were only 30”.
1.0,"The turquoise does not have any brown and is cut much wider than the pearls.  In the picture, these looked elegant, slender and subtly colored.  In reality they are loud and cheap looking because of the large and very blue pieces of turquoise."
1.0,Broke in 3 days. Not worth returning.  In the trash!
1.0,I bought one of these as a fan or the story from when I was younger and read comics. I bought one and when it arrived one of the stones was already missing. They sent me a replacement item but today most of the stones fell out of this one. I wouldn't recommend unless you only want it to look at.
1.0,Too short and too wide
1.0,"Terrible quality, after one wash is full of little lint all over, picture looks a lot nicer.  Also larger than expected."
1.0,"Bright peach, not champagne"
1.0,"Came broken, I didn't have high expectations, I had it on, very cheesy looking...I wouldn't suggest buying this."
1.0,Dress was NOT long. Was high/low and was not what the picture in ad showed. Even the white polka dots were bigger. Returned unattractive item.
1.0,"Too big for my head. When I adjust it, it doesn’t look good in the back. Too much of the strap hangs out. Not made like most LIG caps, which I have a number of."
1.0,"This bag was a disappointment! It had a very strong smell that made you feel sick, it was an odd color pink, and it was very cheap looking."
1.0,What I received was not at all what the picture shows. Material is very flimsy.
1.0,It broke before i even got to wear it. It broke as I was just trying to unscrew the top ball.
1.0,It’s huge. I ordered a small and it fits like a large.
1.0,Bit smippy
1.0,Does not fit size way to small had holes in product
1.0,"why replace the battery on a new watch.  tried and sent back two watches,  both were DOA."
1.0,"“Magnetic therapy” does not work. It produces no measurable effect on blood flow. Blood is not ferromagnetic, so it does not react to magnetic fields. This product is fraudulent."
1.0,"Button hole, but no button on it to use it."
1.0,False advertisement. I only got one scarf. I am going to report to amazon. Bad business practice.
1.0,Sizing was extremely large
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c2db6036f986daf80d576e94a1004f20]] 4th Edit. These are junk and may only work for so long. You're better off making your own to make sure you leash is fitted properly! Lost two of my Breeze disposable vapes. So frustrating! I'd give a zero if I could!
1.0,"Looks Cheap, Husband was not happy"
1.0,"I wear a 14-16/xl and I ordered a xl.  This romper is WAY off!  Love the material, very pretty colors but the sizing is at least 2 sizes off."
1.0,One was broken wouldn't stay closed
1.0,Most of these didn't work when they arrived it was a waste of money. If they all worked they would be great
1.0,The band doesn’t have support to stay on it keeps falling off
1.0,"1/30/2015, I just returned your watch today, for a refund. It didn't keep time very well; and I'm was not satified with it. arhttp://www.vintageivy.com/catalog/_media/2014/10/E-future-Pure-Brass-Retro-Skeleton-Unisex-Roman-Gold-Mechanical-Chain-Pocket-Watch-0-310x500.refund.It was very pretty but it doesn't keep time very well"
1.0,"This is ridiculous. It was advertised as a whole costume, even described that way. It's just a cape. My son was supposed to have his costume for tomorrow. Now I'm scrambling to get something else for him."
1.0,Fits but not what ordered. Its a different color but still feathers.
1.0,"shipping took 7 weeks For item to arrive, it has a terrible odor to it that makes me want to throw up when wearing it.<br />I have washed it multiple times and the smell never came out.<br />Only wore the shirt for a few minutes but yhe fit was pretty decent."
1.0,Very cheap feeling.. not soft at all. Zero stretch & they run small.<br /><br />Waste of money. Do not recommend.
1.0,Listed as no slip. They slip.
1.0,Dis like
1.0,The two sides were not aligned and created double vision when looking underwater. Will NOT buy this product type again;
1.0,Size chart is misleading had to resale dress to someone else
1.0,Order never came and they ignored my request for a refund. Avoid them. Lots of other vendors . Their tracking numbers do not work.
1.0,I have used this luggage for less than 6 months. On the large suitecase the handle on top and one of the casters broke on the 3 and 4th trip respectively. The medium size handel broke  on its first trip. Poor design handles and caster mountings--not durable.
1.0,This is at least three sizes smaller than stated. It smells so bad that I got a headache.
1.0,The print of the shirt was upside down.
1.0,"I bought two of these for a Christmas stocking stuffer and the boys hate them. I can’t return them, but if I could I would get the one that has the money clip. I bought two of them, one for me and I like it a lot."
1.0,"They do not come as shown in the picture. Where they are opposite and therefore symmetrical. In the picture, one side is shorter than the other and it shows the opposite side shorter for the other ear. I received these and they are both exactly the same, short on the same side. They look stupid. I will return them."
1.0,Poorly cut.
1.0,I bought the ex lg cause that’s my size according to the size chart but they’re so small I can’t even pull them over my butt . I’ll be returning them .
1.0,Display is too dark to read easily outside
1.0,The threading was off and it ruined the entire navel ring!!!
1.0,I ordered this hat and the coloring was way brighter than what is pictured and it is not criss crossed  in the back at all it is just a hole for your pony tail. My hair is short and the hole is to high so I exchanged it for a new one and noted the issues I had with the first one. I received the replacement and it was the exact same color as the first and again not criss crossed. I would not recommend ordering this item
1.0,They were uncomfortable across the nose
1.0,"Order this if you do not have a Dollar Tree, otherwise it's a gouge"
1.0,I returned these because they are totally see through.
1.0,"I don’t have time to take it back, very disappointed"
1.0,"I had to have this repaired because the stitching never caught right under the pocket area, there was a inch hole in the leg under the pocket"
1.0,"I put them on and one of them snapped in half while on my ear and fell off - less than five minutes.  The other seemed fine but one of them was obviously so weak it couldn't  handle the pressure of just being on my ear so I took the other one off carefully and fought back tears.<br /><br />I've been looking at these for a long time but could not splurge on myself.  I finally saved up, gave in and bought them and they looked so pretty.  I was dreadfully sick when they arrived so I didn't put them on.  I finally got better and took them out of my jewelry box the other day and put them on - was impressed for a few minutes and that was it.<br /><br />Considering all my health problems, it's nothing to cry about a broken earring but at the moment it was a total bummer. Apparently I should have put them on sooner because putting them on this weekend was a couple days past the return date.  Not only did I finally splurge for myself, I assumed they were quality because they looked so pretty - bad idea.  Now I wasted my only luxury money and got nothing for it. DO NOT BUY THESE, they are not sturdy enough to sit on your earlobe - I can't imagine they would last a night out or wearing them to work on a regular basis.  I thought I would get a pair and if they were really great I could get them for my niece at Christmas, thank goodness I didn't get 2 pairs right away or I would be even more upset, a 14 yr old could never make these last if I can't wear them for 5 minutes."
1.0,The ankle footies fit well. I was disappointed when I put my 1st pair on and after wearing them without shoes I looked down to  notice that I had a whole in the footie. Next day I put a pair on and noticed another whole developed on the left foot.
1.0,These glasses are made very cheap! You get what you pay for but they look really nothing like this. To me they resemble those 3D glasses you get at the movie theatre! Will not be wearing. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Advertised as 1 size fits all up to 43+ bust. So 40"" here & there was no way I could button it up. Unless u r sm. busted, don't bother ordering!"
1.0,I wouldn’t give this dress any stars but you can’t do that anyway I ordered a 3x but the dress looks like a small smh I won’t be ordering from them again
1.0,"I bought this for my nephew's 8th Birthday Party. He is obsessed with Fortnite and I bough a ton of items from Amazon, Party City, etc. The one big fail of the day is the Boogie Bomb as it does not work. Myself and four other family members put in multiple sets of new batteries, and nothing we could do would make it work. Very upsetting. The packaging was slightly mangled when I got it but i initially chalked it up to moving around in the delivery box. The packaging says you can test it, I did and it did not work so my initial assumption was that it just needed new batters. My assumption was incorrect as nothing we tried would make it work. Very disappointing."
1.0,If your not a size 2 your wont be fitting into the xl
1.0,I liked the look of it but two of my stones fell out the second time I wore it!
1.0,"Right off the bat, the very first time my wife tried to put these in her ears, a piece snapped off. She's been wearing pierced earrings for decades, so she's pretty good at putting them in, and I can't blame it on fumbling around trying to find the hole.<br /><br />It appears by looking closely at the earrings, that they have tool marks all over them, especially noticeable on the wire shafts that go into the ears. It looks to me like the maker used some kind of pliers to make ""grippy marks"" on the shafts so the plastic piece that slips on (backer) will 'grip' the wire and not fall off.<br /><br />Trouble is, the marks went so far into the soft silver wires that it compromised the shaft. The slightest touch made it snap off. Honestly, I think they would have been better off omitting the ""grippy mark"" attempts, and just leave the wire shaft alone. It doesn't really need a backer, since the wires are so long.<br /><br />So either not a good design, or bad quality control, I dunno. It's a shame, because the earrings are cute, and she really liked them. Unfortunately, I can't recommend them."
1.0,I’ve bought a brown Wallet and i received a black wallet
1.0,"First of all, the photo doesn't look at all  like the blouse I received. The photo shows an asymetrical hem, which was not the case in the item I received. The linen materal looked okay (didn't wash it of course)  but when I tried it on, it looked as if I were wearing nurses' scrubs! Strange thing is, if you have 4 weeks or so to wait for its arrival, you can find the very same tunic on Amazon, shipped from Asia, for a fraction of the cost. Go figure! I don't have the time to shop in clothing stores, so I try to order clothing items on Amazon. Some work out well, but most just don't live up to the photos and descriptions, alas. Thankfully Amazon accepts returns, of which there are many on my account due to inferior quality arriving at my door. But returns take time to process, so I am hoping Amazon can offer quality American made products at a reasonable rate."
1.0,"Do not buy it, the rubber that holds the strip to the glasses cracks, it does not last more than a month."
1.0,It rust  you literally cant scuff them (scratch) at all or it will start rusting
1.0,"Instead of a Clear White Quartz Gemstone, we got a cheap piece of plastic shaped like an arrow.. Returning ASAP."
1.0,"This is 27""by 27"". It looks nothing like the picture. Should be a - star rating."
1.0,"Item is listed as a pack of 3, only received ONE! Really disappointed! Don't bother!"
1.0,3rd party trying to return it.too small!!need label too return this please help!
1.0,"Nunca me llego , lo bueno es que me hicieron. El reembolso y lo pude pedir nueva mente voy a ver si ahora si me llega"
1.0,"I wear in between a large and a 2X in shirts so I listened to reviews and ordered a 3X, I cant even zip the darn thing up. Its too tight."
1.0,Just terrible. Loked like part of a costume. Returned immediately
1.0,"I purchased a 2x and received a medium, I'm going to give it to my niece for Christmas. Very disappointed!"
1.0,No es lo que ofrecen  solo es una mentira  la foto es una  lo que le mandan es otra una maleta experiencia
1.0,"Frame of dress was very cute, but the material was very cheap and flimsy. Buckle for back of dress was suspect, not secure at all"
1.0,"Too big, will donate them at chemo center"
1.0,"This product is a farza, it does not work, it is only nice on the outside, but in the days of having it the pin of the needles was twisted, it had to be Chinese."
1.0,Color was not as bright as the picture looked worn not what I expected
1.0,Sized up two sizes and still didn’t fit. Seller does not do returns.
1.0,"Purchased this ring in July. By August 30th, A stone had already come out. The ring looks better online than it does in person. Looks fake. Can't send it back with free returns because the window for returns closed in the beginning of August. Not. Happy."
1.0,Broke after wearing one time
1.0,Not what I expect from Pandora- looks cheap
1.0,Too sheer/see through
1.0,"This is NOT a boot knife as advertised! The sheath is nylon with a belt loop, no way to secure it inside your boot, no clip at all."
1.0,Quality is not good. Didn’t wear well.
1.0,I'm not sure if the pair I got was marked the wrong size or what.  I ordered a large and based on their size guide it should have fit perfectly.  My daughter normally wears a women's XS and these barely fit her.
1.0,"Ridiculously small lol. Ordered a large, unstretched and not including the foot part, the legs are about 1.5 long. If i were to wear this the crotch of the costume would be at my knees. I looked like baby legs from Rick and Morty."
1.0,"I had to return this bag due to back zipper malfunction.  Just got another one today same problem, Ughh"
1.0,The watch looks great and it worked fine for about 20 days.  Then I was working outside and it was hot and I was sweaty.  The watch totally fogged up and stopped working.  Amazon gave me a refund but be careful.  It is not at all waterproof or even water resistant and in a wet environment with a lot of sweat and it is toast.
1.0,It appears to snap but it doesn’t really fit correctly. The easily clasp disconnects from the Fitbit when you’re in motion. (Even just walking) so if you’re in the middle of an intense workout you might not realize that you’ve lost your watch. That’s a huge and expensive risk just to change the color of your band.
1.0,"Stretch pants, advertised as 88% nylon, 12 % spandex, were more like parachute material instead of stretch.  My Wranglers, 96% nylon, 4 % spandex, are more flexible than these... and 1/3 cheaper. The sizing chart said size 34 would fit waist 34"" to 36"" which they do not."
1.0,This skirt is made from a thick cotton like material that does not “flow” but it is rather stiff. Will be returning.
1.0,Product is very thin and runs really small. Did not offer good refund
1.0,Size mentioned and shown on the webpage and the actual product size is very wrong. Had to buy more than required because of wrong size. Sending back is not an option as the postage cost is more than the value of the product.
1.0,"This top looks nothing like its picture, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to this one. It is boxy, too big, and the lace arms come down way too long. Returning it ASAP."
1.0,Very poorly made. I bought a large it would have fit a child. The sweater was very itchy. Do not buy!
1.0,I used it for six miles it’s hard to remove from the cleats despite adjustments very dangerous I don’t feel safe using it
1.0,"Very cheap looking, doesn’t look like the picture at all!!! Very disappointed.."
1.0,I brought this for my daith piercing and was highly disappointed. For one the stones and gold plated metal look extremely cheap in person. Secondly it’s bigger than 8mm as another buyer stated. My ear is slightly bigger so I took a chance. Last but certainly not least the metal irritates my ear and left the inside green in one area. So cheap!
1.0,"One of the strands fell off the necklace the first time I wore it. I was walking down the street and one strand literally dropped off.  I'm so disappointed, as it's a lovely necklace."
1.0,It was broke. You can hear it raddleing .
1.0,I WAS DISAPPOINTED ON THE SIZE OF THE EARRINGS.THEY ARE FOR A CHILD NOT AN ADULT
1.0,"It's cute, I love the idea. But there's nearly no way to put it in your ear. Couldn't even use it. Do not buy this."
1.0,I ordered a gym shirt but received a multi pack of fuzzy rabbit ears? Now I have to run around to return it. Frustrating
1.0,Save yourself a headache. Buy a Chinese tourbillion. They are about $300. They keep good time and are actual tourbillions. Mass produced using stamped parts granted. No where near swiss quality of course. They run a few seconds fast per day. I recommend Aesop Tourbillions. Skip any other Chinese movements.
1.0,"Very Poor design, nothing to hold your boobs in the top fits horrible, can not recommend tried to different sizes both fit the same in that area!"
1.0,I disliked how small they were.
1.0,Fits too small does cover when sitying
1.0,"I'm 4' 11"" tall 36C bra. Short upper torso. This shirt is horrible on me. Neckline way too deep. Stiff fabric."
1.0,TOI THICK TO FIT
1.0,Did not function as advertised. Material rolled into itself when attempting to install on my glasses.
1.0,"Did NOT look like the picture.  Very boxy, not at all fitted.  Cut a hole in top of a pillow case and toss that on.  Same look/feel."
1.0,"The print is exactly as shown in the picture. It is somewhat large so that the cut outs fall off the shoulder for me. but the most important thing is as soon as i opened the package, there was horrible chemical smell. I could not wear this top without getting a headache. have to return..."
1.0,"They don't work.  I had a pair that did, but they did not fit my head right.  They were too small and I have a big fat head.  I bought these and they fit my head but the lenses did not help any.  I don't think the lenses are dark enough.  The pair I had, had much darker lenses."
1.0,We just got this toy for my son and it’s awful.  And now they won’t let me return it.  He’s in tears and I’m 🤬. No cool!
1.0,Cheap fabric and thin. Not in any way worth what I paid.
1.0,Leggings are soft and warm but definitely not squat proof. Big disappointment for the price of the leggings
1.0,"Bought in 3 different sizes.  On the surface, it looked nice.  One of our kids got a hold of one to play with and before you know it, the ring came apart, then the stones started to fall off.  Keep in mind, it was just regular play.  Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,i couldn’t even walk down my hallway. i’ve never returned anything faster in my LIFE
1.0,"hate the material, the texture is just off unless that wicking is what you like I personally don`t. I prefer more cotton in the blend"
1.0,Total crap
1.0,"This looked really pretty straight out the package, but it’s basically just a glittery piece of elastic. After a week of wear the elastic starts to loosen. If you wear it daily it may catch snags."
1.0,Bought for my sister arrived broken it matched a bracelet I bought her she loves butterflies now I made her sad thanks.  She knows l'm sad
1.0,"not well made, the seams ripped on every pair the first time I wore them."
1.0,Poor quality - see through
1.0,Stones fell off immediately
1.0,"Great idea, poor programming the app.  The only thing you can program is text in the mask."
1.0,"The shirt is beautiful, I loved the texture, but the smell of the print is unbearable, I've washed it 3 times and still haven't been able to use it."
1.0,Broke on the first day using it and started leaking water everywhere. Completely useless.
1.0,It was not true to size. It did not fit and I was very disappointed and sad.
1.0,The beard is so thin you can see right through it.  So very disappointed
1.0,Not good quality at all. Returned. Looked used or repackaged.
1.0,Did not adhere very well at all
1.0,The quality is what you pay for. None of them were the same colors and none were the same size.
1.0,This was a very thin sweatshirt that cost too much money cause it had an nfl team logo on it. It was thinner than most sweatshirts u can purchase elsewhere.  Very disappointed and returned the shirt.
1.0,I let them know it was too small and they said they put the us size and the china size which they didn't. Was very unsatisfied.  Didn't even know it came from china.<br />The only thing I can say good is that it came before the time specified.
1.0,Silver finish is bubbling and coming off straight out of the box so I can only imagine what it's going to look like after a couple wears.... disappointed...don't waste your money.
1.0,I don't understand why the same comapany size their different model clothes differently. Way to tight.
1.0,"Ordered according to the provided size chart and was very snug. Definitely not the “flowy” fit advertised. Also, it barely passed my waist so not tunic length either"
1.0,"This was a great winter coat (nice length, comfy size for layers, nice big pockets for hats and gloves, plenty warm for a Wisconsin winter) UNTIL the zipper snagged on itself (nothing stuck in it) and became useless a mere two months after purchase."
1.0,Had to buy another chain in sterling silver. Chain turned color less than a week. Bad chain.
1.0,"Horrible quality, paper thin."
1.0,Devolucion completa Por favor mi reembolzo please era muy grande ho return mi reembolzo devolucion completa help me refounds ok devolucion complete big size mo more dress ok devolucion help me refounds more penalty ok no tengo fotos pero no eran my size ok
1.0,Broke the first time it was worn.
1.0,got this dress and the stitching was already coming apart under the bust.
1.0,You won't be able to see straight and you also cannot see much.
1.0,This item arrived dirty and stained in the underarm area. Disgusting. There was also a rip in the seam that connected the shoulder strap. Totally unsatisfied with this product.
1.0,The shirt looks nothing like the pics on line.  It looks home made and cheap.  When I receive the other two I ordered I will be sending them back. SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!
1.0,"broke as soon as i wore it. it broke into 3 pieces, and i feel like i want my money back for it or a replacement that isn't going to break"
1.0,Matching pouch was not delivered.
1.0,Not happy with these clip on shades. I don’t like The clip on part. It doesn’t hold on good. But you get what you pay for.
1.0,"These worked well, for a week. Waste of money and  your child will be disappointed. Immediately one of the remotes did not work and I wasn't too upset, but a week later each shoe stopped working as well. If you want light up shoes, don't buy these. My poor son is so disappointed and I am not able to return these."
1.0,Too pink unlike the picture.
1.0,All the letters and graphics are peeling off after just one wash!
1.0,"I bought this in the blush color and after washing in cold water ondelicate cycle, there were spots that faded to white - almost like bleach spots, but I don't have any bleach in my house.  I have never had this type of thing ever happen with any clothing. Can't wear - garbage."
1.0,The baby turtle come right off. Not sturdy.
1.0,"I am so sad about this product. Those necklace are a metal odor, it is so strong."
1.0,The shirt fits oddly - doesn’t drape well and it may be because there isn’t room for error.
1.0,"OMG, are you serious? These XL are more like XS. Waited forever to get them and must return. Which I see now this must be mailed back overseas. So the refund will take forever. Don’t buy this unless you’re the size of a 10-year-old skinny boy!"
1.0,Ripped after use
1.0,"This item that I ordered which was a small is more fit for an extra Large size. And there is what looks like a bleach stain on the top back of the jumpsuit, I cannot wear this, it looks so much better on the picture than on."
1.0,This is not a real shungite. When it scratches it shows silver color underneath.
1.0,sent me a random shirt
1.0,It did not fit right..
1.0,Poorly made and the fit was terrible. Would not recommend.
1.0,The black well grey one was very faded and the white one had dark marks all over.
1.0,ZERO STARS! worst purchase to date. As soon as I felt the pkg I knew I was in for it. This is most definitely NOT a chunky oversized sweater(see pics) I ordered a medium and it may be an oversized for a person that normally wears XS. The material is so thin and and so loosely knitted that I might as well have bought a fishnet sweater. Ok now let’s take a moment to laugh at the sleeves. 🤣😂they are NOT full length and they are not even the same length. AND they are not the same circumference. One fits tight and the other way too loose.(see pic)<br />Oh boy and then there is the collar issue. It is uneven and one side is loose and wavy almost like the sleeve that is too wide. Save yourself the time. Keep looking. DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,Nice belt had it fit. I wear a 34 so I ordered a 38 for the belt. Needless it was too small and fit my 11 year old perfectly.
1.0,wayyy too small. did nothing at all for me.
1.0,"Ordered down-filled booties on March 10, 2020. Got information that they were delayed and would ""keep me informed"".  Wrote first part of June, 2020 asking for refund; got a reply June 14, 2020.that booties would be here in one month.  I refused and, again asked for a refund.  Booties were in my mail box today, June 17, 2020. These come directly from Zhejiang Province, China.  As my headline states:  Buyer Beware!<br />"""
1.0,Way smaller and shorter than expected.
1.0,It’s short sleeved
1.0,Read all the reviews and thought I was safe with my order. Nope. It was huge. I could have easily gone down two sizes and still had it fit. Oh well.
1.0,Broke the second I put them on
1.0,Got for Xmas present last year. My daughter was not rough with this and it completely fell apart. Big waste of money.
1.0,"The earrings are absolutely gorgeous but unfortunately, a pair of them have broken clasps! I hope to contact the seller about this!"
1.0,Purchased twice thinking the 1st time it broke was a fluke. So I purchase another I like the way it looked and it was “leather” broke again reached out to seller “surprise”. No response
1.0,They are so tiny. I am very disappointed!
1.0,It so see thru not good if your wearing this without a long shirt. I had this for a few months and it already ripped. I wouldn't buy this is again.
1.0,"Item advertised: Evrimas Men's Ripstop Nylon Expandable Waist Cargo Shorts. Item received: Han Ton Nylon Cargo Shorts. Also,poor stitching around the button hole such that the button catches on loose threads. I will return this item."
1.0,"Very upset. Got this bookbag for my 5th grade cousin and before buying it, i read it was a big bookbag and has alot of space. WRONG. It cant even fit more than 1 binder. How unfortunate."
1.0,Looks like I bought it at the dollar store- very poorly made and crappy thin fabric
1.0,Cuando el hielo se va derritiendo el agua entra en las botas
1.0,"You can’t totally tell but the pics are leopard print. So, wasn’t expecting that. Also it’s really small. I’m a size medium and it fit skin tight."
1.0,This shirt stinks so bad! There is a chemical smell that won't come off. I returned it!
1.0,Flimsy material. Didn't like the company name printed on the bottom of the SKORT! Fits very small. Ordered a medium and fits like an xsm.
1.0,Watch looks ok but it came with a dead battery. That's a lack of QC. Now I have to go to a watch shop to get a battery exchange.  Thanks Amazon for sending me a dead product!!:D
1.0,I ordered one size bigger and it it was still too small. I ordered a large and it was more like a kids large. I tried contacting the seller and it's been almost a week tomorrow with no response. Don't order.
1.0,I hate it.
1.0,"Very disappointed with the dress. First of all, it's too big for XS. I would've still been alright but the material is so cheap. There were weird white patches all over the dress, which shows how cheap quality the material is"
1.0,Sent them back.  Cheap product and oversized.  A little gaudy as well.
1.0,Literally worn away and faded in 4-5 terrible quality don’t buy
1.0,Super Cheap! They’re cute but not for $5 Something that should be in a dollar store!
1.0,I was disappointed the white was more like beige.
1.0,"It was not faded the way the picture showed. It was much brighter and the flowers were very pixel-y. Size-wise, the large fit as expected. Will be returning because I do not like the flowers being out of focus."
1.0,Super unflattering. It’s basically a men’s top
1.0,"Returned to seller, descriptions should say that the shirt runs big. Prime didn't arrive in 2 days. Very poor experience ordering from this seller.<br /><br />I'm 6', 195lbs, average dad-bod build and the shirt had way too much room, arms were too long and very baggy."
1.0,"These earrings are tiny,but I guess I should have read the description more thoroughly"
1.0,Straps came off so 0 Stars
1.0,I wouldn't recommend these earrings to anyone who has sensitivity and can only wear real gold.As soon as I put them on my ears turned red and inflamed-just what happens when I try to wear cheap earrings! I do not believe these are real gold as I never have a problem with real 14K gold.
1.0,"Received as a replacement because the first one  has wobbly arms listed as Brand NEW but when I opened it up, right lens has 2.5 mm scratch  right out of the box?  Really?! It's a shame because the frame looks really good but the most important thing , the lens is damaged.  Poor quality control. Returned!!!"
1.0,Not all the pieces was there
1.0,Very poor quality. Wanted for Hallween received too late.
1.0,Quality was very poor!! Shirt was suppose to be navy but was mismatched with black sleeves. The sewing of the seems were very poor with overlapping in the material.
1.0,These pants were advertised as 34 waist and 27 inseam... They were at least 36 waist and 32 inch inseam
1.0,"These are as cheap as they come. Arrived with one earring intact and the other, not. Plastic and really really bad quality. I expect they would likely fall apart after wearing once."
1.0,This dress looks nothing like the picture! the fabric is cheap
1.0,I ordered a small and I am 5’3 135lbs and the small was too big. The zipper is way too long when you sit down it bunches and sticks out.
1.0,The design stated to wear off within minutes of wearing it. I returned it within a week because it was almost all work away. Do not but this product.
1.0,This bathing suit is for a toddler but the bottoms look like they are for an adult.  The top was fine but there is no way the bottoms will fit within the next 4 years.
1.0,I purchased the white linen pants for a vacation coming up soon but they were too small. They run small. That’s information I didn’t have at the time of my purchase.
1.0,These sock are so tight that I could hardly get them on and off. Caused leg pain because of the tightness.
1.0,Broke after 1 month of normal use. A pin fell out that holds links together
1.0,I don't know how someone can confuse a dress with a shirt
1.0,"Lasted maybe 4 months before beginning to fall apart and fray along corners, straps weakened in 4 months, started to break 5 months. It is now in the bottom of a landfill somewhere.  If you want a purse to use maybe 40 days - this is your purse."
1.0,Cheap quality for the price.  There are better options.  I would not buy this belt again.
1.0,Not polarized - lenses ruined after they got wet.
1.0,"Very poorly put together. Darts/seams were way off. One seam for one breast was really close to the shoulder and the other side,was near the waist line.<br />I returned it. They were very gracious on the return."
1.0,"I purchased the 10ft cantilever umbrella a few months ago.  It arrived without the swivel piece that mounts the umbrella pole to the base.  Instead of returning it, I reached out to Wikiwiki support to try and acquire the missing piece.  They said that they would send it to me.  I never received it.  After a week and a half went by I reached out for an update.  They again promised that they would send it but never did.  It's been two months since I ordered it and still have not received the missing part.  Terrible quality control with even worse customer service."
1.0,"If you wear a bigger size bra, this is not for you. I wear a 38DDD in regular bras, and ordered one of these and lets just say my hand was bigger than then cup of it."
1.0,I wear XL or 1X.  The shirt does not hang loose. It showed every ounce of fat. Had to return.
1.0,A very nice sweater except the sleeves are not finish and it gives it a very cheap look.
1.0,Not what I wanted waste of money see through don't buy I I want my money back

1.0,Locket does not stay closed.
1.0,Worst quality ever! Do not buy. I returned.
1.0,The watch broke with in the hour of wearing it.
1.0,chap stick falls out of the holder.
1.0,This isn’t a flattering shirt at all. I’m 5’2” and about 120lbs and curvy… this shirt looked like a tent and the color looked faded.
1.0,Dont waste tour money I only got this because it was the cheapest ring i could find to test out the sizing but it feels plastic both in weight and the polish quality
1.0,THE WORST!!!! THE TEETH ARE NICE!!! TOO BAD THEY DONT STAY ON!!! THE GLUE STINKS AND THEY FALL RIGHT OFF!!! NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY!!!
1.0,It won't let me push the only got over my head. Button as in....whoever new sellers are clothes sure are tight.  I've lost 4p lbs down to 160.  2x should not be tight 5 of last orders too tight.  Thinking of using another site that is more accurate.  Might just be me.
1.0,Warning! Look up Tahitian black pearls before you buy these.
1.0,"The box that the shoes arrived in was broken and torn. Inside, the shoes were blemished and of extremely poor quality. The leather itself looked like it had been scuffed and only parts of it polished. There was dust and debris all along the seem were the leather met the sole, as if they had been sitting out in a storage area for a while. They smelled very strongly of rubber, which unfortunately lingers, which in turn would make wearing them in a professional environment impossible. I had better hopes given the reviews on these shoes, but they are on their way to be returned."
1.0,"This has a very weird fit. The sides are absolutely straight, no flare for the hips, and the pockets are very high.  It can be unbuttoned completely so I'm using it as an overshirt instead."
1.0,Distory
1.0,Does not work with Timex Expedition; cannot attach to watch body. I think this is for a smart watch.
1.0,Absolutely not the same as presented.  This must be a joke and they charge for returns too.  Will never buy from them again.  These pants look appalling.
1.0,Loved the way this item looked when it was previewed online but when receiving the item it had a completely different look and feel I was expecting. Looked nothing like the picture. Super short way above my ankles. It look more like Capris. Very unhappy especially as it’s almost 40$ I’ll be returning.
1.0,small and uncomfortable
1.0,"They fit well, but not comfortable with the higher wedge. They were cute!"
1.0,"These panties are for girls not woman. I normally wear size medium in panties, but chose to get large for just in case it runs small. I found out even the large is too small. Not worth buying at all, waist of money!"
1.0,The color pink looks different and is very ugly. Case is sturdy
1.0,"The cape was way too short, couldn't even use it. Going to return it."
1.0,The sun already destroyed them and they are not comfortable at all!
1.0,"I wear a size 4 in women's, I ordered a med, these things didn't come close to fitting me."
1.0,One is bent badly. Can't get barely any good luck on Amazon these days...reordering and hopefully the second pair will be better.
1.0,Pretty but arrived broken.
1.0,"We purchased 2 of these for Halloween for our daughters. While they are the perfect size hats for children, the hats are cheaply made. Both hats ordered had strings hanging down that we had to deal with and within minutes of one being put on, the seam came unraveled, and a big hole appeared. My daughter was crushed. Luckily we had time to go get hats from another store,"
1.0,Band is cracking/peeling after exactly one week of use.
1.0,"Too thin, too small and did not use it at all. Waste of time n money to be honest."
1.0,"The dress is  not African material. If u r looking for qood quality , don't buy this dress. The size fits great but it looks cheap..i will give mine away"
1.0,"This product was not what I thought it was going to be. It doesn’t fit, not even close and the material is cheap."
1.0,These pjs run very small and very tight. I had to return them
1.0,"i've had it a month and carried three credit cards in the slots under the strong magnetic money clip.  Now, all three of my credit card stripes are stripped and are no longer readable."
1.0,Missing buttons on front of coat seems too be worn I would not recommend this I do like color. But cheaply made 🤬
1.0,"This band fit my Casio AD-S800WH watch.  The band itself if very pliable, but on the short side for an average sized guy.<br /><br />Edit:  It's been about a week, and it broke already at the pin where it fastens to the watch.  While I've been wearing it, I was on the third to the last hole in the band.  It is just not long enough.  I will not purchase again."
1.0,Arrived cheaply made and broken. Was not able to use them. Didn't pay much so I'm not that upset. Tossed then.
1.0,Horrible don’t buy
1.0,"Ill-fitting. Save your money! Dress was tight in the sleeves though that wasn't a deal breaker for me: The bust was entirely too small/narrow and ""high up"" in the dresses design. Finally the pockets. They weren't bulky but they, too, were placed too high on the dress. With my hands inside them (reaching upward to do so), I could easily squeeze my ribs or pat my tummy. No way I could store anything in them, especially a comfy place for my hands, the way a slouch dress *should* fit."
1.0,Arms are too small.
1.0,LOW QUALITY
1.0,This is very cheap material however I will use it because I just primarily needed something that would cover me and stay as I apply my make up and do my hair..
1.0,Scratchy material and the elastic around your wrists is annoying. Plus it’s very small.
1.0,They are awful uncomfortable too big
1.0,Need to return product<br />Poor cut and too small
1.0,Frumpy...not a good look.
1.0,I am not sure what size chest people have but I have a do you to DD and when I tried to use this product it did not stick very well at all I’m not sure if I was doing something wrong maybe I was supposed to wash my breasts before hand but it did not stick it all and I did not receive any support from that whatsoever I might have as well have been just going Braleass
1.0,returned. too small. sizing off
1.0,I order weekly from Amazon for work and personal.  This product was NOT what was pictured.  It will not fit unless you have hands like my wife.  WILL NOT purchase from seller again.
1.0,I didn’t really like it. It ended up getting caught in my hair a lot and it didn’t look like the picture
1.0,This is not silk.  It is a cheap polyester scarf like you would buy at K-Mart.  Not even WalMart quality.  Very short. Not worth the time to even send it back.
1.0,Useless never stayed up
1.0,I get the wrong size
1.0,only order if you are a very slim person
1.0,Looks nice but quality suck lasted 1 day little metal pieces started popping off and now band won’t lock into place junk and unless now
1.0,Not at all like the picure. Doesn't hang down that low on the shoulder even if you try to force it. I wear a medium and ordered a small. I should have ordered XS or XXS and I still don't think it would look right. Waste of money. The only way it looks cute is if you stand just like that for a selfie. Just walking around looks like you're wearing a sheet
1.0,Cheap material! Hated it.
1.0,Horrible! Unbelievably cheap quality! Inaccurate sizing! Very disappointed!
1.0,This set only includes 4 pieces for mitten clips. One of each color.
1.0,I wasted my money on this much to small!
1.0,When it arrived the first thing was the color. It’s a doll very dark grey. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,The hair tie will not stay on AT ALL. A total waste of $.
1.0,Ordered woman’s size XL and got a pair that would maybe fit a size 10 little girl. Comes from China so having difficulty returning it.
1.0,Poorly made. & more like a T-Shirt. So angry I spent money on this garbage!
1.0,"I don't even know why they included these in this product page, because the 3 pairs selection are not heated, just regular socks.  Now they might be good enough socks but that's not what I thought I was getting.  I saw this in the Vine program with the picture of heated socks as well as when I clicked on the option to order, so I merely glanced at it and ordered.  Even on the product page, the description for these doesn't even change, only the price does, so they are claiming to be heated as well, which they certainly are not.  Buyers beware."
1.0,Very small! This skirt was fitted on my sister who wears size medium in regular clothes
1.0,Peanuts Gang characters looked different. Not cute. It's priced cheaply and looks it. Had some ugly crystal-looking plastic beads that made it uglier.
1.0,"Loved the picture online, doesn't reflect any 3D in person, disappointed."
1.0,"came in wrinkles.no any kind of information of item,  looks like from garage sale"
1.0,I loved these socks but I was so disappointed that the stitching started coming out of the sock! I didn’t even wash them!
1.0,Nice look but sleeve is short and not very soft
1.0,3x is more like large.
1.0,"Unfortunately when this tie arrived it was extremely wrinkled, has lots of loose threads and has a spot on it. I am hoping to be able to get the spot out as the function that it was ordered for is in 3 days and I don't think I have time to exchange or order a new one."
1.0,These were terrible pieces. They did not fit at all how the picture shows them. They are made from a cheap plastic covered in told paint. Three of them broke the first day.
1.0,"This item is not for tall people and it looks nothing like what the model has on, a waste of money."
1.0,They had a very horrible smell to them and I even ordered 2 sizes bigger and they were way to small.
1.0,Runs extremely small. This is more like for a child or teenager based on the size.
1.0,I purchased these pants four different times trying to get the ones that were in the pictures of people posting reviews unfortunately I never received anything close to those
1.0,Seams ripped apart after one wash. Stay away from these sweatpants.
1.0,frame stretched too big for head kinda hurt around nose ... cheap cheap cheap<br />But they look good lol 😆
1.0,Absolute garbage.  Pattern does not match what is shown.  Fabric is awful.  Had to throw it away.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Scam scam scam
1.0,The quality of the product is not what I was expecting
1.0,"Very disappointed in this piece of jewelry. It does not look the way it is shown on your site. Very CHEAP, money lost."
1.0,"These masks are mostly a polyester material which is misleading considering the title of the item says cotton masks. It does says it is a cotton/polyester mix once you look at the description, but read carefully! Ruined my tie dye project I had for Christmas presents. Don’t waste your money if you want these for tie dye."
1.0,"This ""hoodie"" was thin like a workout tshirt. Not warm at all"
1.0,This would maybe fit a Barbie doll! Ordered an extra Large it is tiny!! Material is aweful too buyer beware!
1.0,Arrived with the main stone missing in one earring. Disappointing because I was planning to wear them for a special occassion.
1.0,"Pockets are ridiculously smalll, like non existent! So basically a slit made to look like a poker. Way disappointing"
1.0,Very cheap. Ripped within a day. Wouldn't buy again.
1.0,Received a damaged product
1.0,"Bought twice, went up in size, but the neck is just too small no matter what size you get."
1.0,Paint starts to come off after 30 minutes after arriving paint job is garbage. And looks nothing like. The gauntlet in the MCU the middle of the fingers has no paint overall I think it’s worth 15$ not 35$ the stones look terrible too
1.0,You can’t even tell what it is because it’s so tiny. I returned it.
1.0,I should have read the details which was my mistake. Poor quality. Two rings total I thought they were connected as one. Turned my toes brown and rusted after a few day. Very dissatisfied will not purchase again. Ook a long time to receive also.
1.0,Full apart after one week 😔
1.0,Theses are a piece of garbage one was broken when received the other one broke on first wearing<br />Don't buy this!!!!!
1.0,"I bought these shoes for my 18 month old, they looked nice, but were too big for him. When he fit into the shoes I realized they had no liner, so there was no cushioning inside the shoe. I was very disappointed, they looked they could have been good shoes if liners had been included."
1.0,Very poorly made! The lining doesn't match the outside of the bag so it puckers and won't stand up. Had to return. Bottom looks NOTHING like the pix!!
1.0,Was so excited to put this on and take some pics around the house but the snaps on the muzzle were off mad it look bad kinda to close together and lopsided. Will probably just return it and look for something better.
1.0,Would return if not for being auto ammunition compromised. Not 100% cotton. Too long by several inches. Fabric not something I’d care to sleep in.
1.0,Not for you if you have a small chest or long torso.
1.0,"After ONE wear, that threads on my arm started unraveling. It for fine. Color was dope. Jacket was 🔥🔥. Soon as I finished leading worship I saw all these strings. I returned the jacket."
1.0,They are too small and not eligible for return. After washing them they lost elasticity and fall off easy.
1.0,The dress in the picture is totally different from what you get. You get a long black and white floral dress. It is beautiful but since I am petite it does not work for me.
1.0,Distorted vision
1.0,These earrings do a disservice to costume jewelry. The ones I receive were missing two small rhinestones on one hearing. I'm sending them back. I was also quite taken aback by how cheap they looked. I've paid less money for earrings at Charming Charlie's that looked more &#34;authentic&#34; than this. very disappointing
1.0,As socks go they are ok. But disappointed with the print. From far away they look like Christmas socks. Up close you cannot tell what is supposed to be on them.
1.0,Glad trash bags have better material than what's used on these leggings. Don't waste your money. You can't even pull these things up over your behind and I'm not working with a donk here ppl!
1.0,Terrible. Not even worth the price seriously something you get out a gumball machine at pizza hut. Extremely lightweight and the moonstone looks like dried glue from a hot glue gun.
1.0,"This product was a disappointment as it is made out of sterfoam and the lids do not close,a crack lets air in and will not keep things cold ,save your money and buy a cooler that is more substantial."
1.0,"I bought the necklace expecting it to be beautiful, however the necklace came tarnished. Black on the back and the front of the necklace. Very disappointing."
1.0,Don’t buy size is not the correct size
1.0,Sent me 2 right feet boots.
1.0,These are not for peirce ears. The balls are not removable and they turn very quick.
1.0,The pin that connect the band to watch broke only after a month of use.
1.0,Sucks didn't get my earings<br />I rate it a zero
1.0,tarnished after wearing 2 times
1.0,They are very pretty but I'm disappointed because they will not fit. They are extremely small and will not fit around the actual nipple so that you can screw the ball on the other side. Very pretty but cant even wear them. Very upset.
1.0,Side boob
1.0,"The watch is cool looking when it lights up, but the battery doesn't last more than a week. The watch looks nice and is very heavy."
1.0,"Size adjustment clasp does not have any teeth and will not stay at the adjusted size,  slips to a bigger size."
1.0,"product took 3 months to ship and arrived molded,damp,and smelled like a musty basement"
1.0,I lost these in a month lol and they stretched my original ear piercing.
1.0,Absolutely massive on a ridiculous level.
1.0,"These sandals look really nice, just what I was looking for.  However, when trying them on I wasn't able to connect the buckles on the heel.  My husband tried and failed as well.  Too bad, they were cute and comfortable."
1.0,"Sloppily made, excess molding, chips in silicone.  Hardness less springy than silicone I’m used to.  Felt tight compared to 00g plugs I currently own.  Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,This product stopped working? After a few months his should not happen. Unable to return on Amazon. Would advise to never purchase this product.  Hoping seller can correct problem.
1.0,"If you don’t wanna lost or accidentally damage your watch, don’t buy it. The band is constantly unfastening"
1.0,"I should have listened to all the other reviews claiming the same thing: these earrings sit in the ear weird + therefore show the ear backing when you are looking head on. From a profile view these earrings are beautiful, but head on it's odd you see the back (which looks different from the front). The backs have a heavy metal presence covering up the tortoise piece, so looks bad."
1.0,These earrings are TINY.  They would get lost in an infants ear hole.  Description is for the packaging size and doesn't really say how big the earrings are.  Don't buy them unless you are looking for a tiny earring for a 4th hole.
1.0,Don't waste your money.  My feet freeze in these. The sock cut off your circulation and are not the same compression all around.
1.0,Says 2T but this is more like 18 months. They are tiny.
1.0,I am very dissatisfied with this purse because the zipper broke after a few months.
1.0,These are small!  More like a women’s size and didn’t fit my hubby at all- so disappointed
1.0,It was so paper this and had a huge hole in it
1.0,"After a few months use, the interior lining ripped.  I hate buying inexpensive bags for this very reason- they don't last!  Bag is still usable, but it will be going to Salvation Army.  Bummer.<br /><br />Nice bag, but I would have preferred a lighter color interior- as I do with all bags.  Dark interior make it difficult to find things.  Also, I'd be happier with larger and deeper side pockets to accommodate my phone or even handy wipes.  That said, I'm fairly happy with the bag."
1.0,"Product was sent with a small tear in the shirt, otherwise it's great! Wish I could wear it."
1.0,This product is not worth your money! It came crumbled up from shopping and had breaks in the cheap plastic. No not recommend at all.
1.0,Buy it at the dollar store for $2.00. Don’t waste your money on this CHEAP a** piece of garbage
1.0,Face not really red and the cover fell off the first time it was worn.
1.0,I had an older Kenneth Cole wallet that lasted me years and I bought this one and it doesn’t even hold up 2 weeks. The snap broke! Now I have to go buy a new one. Seems fake.
1.0,The glasses arrived broke. the arm on the left side was completely off the front of the frames. also bent very bad DONT BUY THESE!  Update after several attempts to discuss this with the company they  do not respond. Their customer support does not exist .
1.0,Broke right away. Disappointing.
1.0,I'm sure this hat is right for someone but my husband did not expect what was received. The hat was coated with some sort of plastic or shellac. (?) It was also stiff as a board. What he wanted was real fabric with some give. So we had to send it back.
1.0,"The shirts were more like kids sizes and not Women. I ordered a medium and large and they were both too little. Also the return policy is deceiving. It says fully refundable but the shipping is not refundable. Also, buyer has to pay for return shipping."
1.0,"DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXTREMELY CHEAP, SUCKY, CLOGGS. THEY ARE NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AND STILL NOT WORTH THE PRICE !!!!!!!!<br />THE MATERIAL IS SO BAD. THE COLOR THEY SHOW LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS. THESE UGLY HOLLOW PLASTIC  SHOES ARE TERRIBLE !!! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM!!!!!"
1.0,Not very good quality. The seams in the middle are not very comfortable.
1.0,"For some reason, it won’t let me post my pics or videos. However, I was excited, as the tiara came in 2 days early. Unfortunately, nothing else good came of this purchase. It came already loose in one area. I figured we’d try it out, since it was inexpensive, and at least get one wear out of it. Yet again, more disappointment… my 18 year-old daughter got to wear it for all of 5 min before it completely broke while simply sitting on her head. Again, I knew it was inexpensive, but didn’t realize it was this incredibly cheap. She’s was wearing it to Evermore Park for NYE and it completely devastated her after merely walking through the doors due to it breaking - outfit was pretty much ruined. Should’ve brought a backup with us."
1.0,Distorts vision slightly... Gave me a headache.  Never used them after.  Pay for the real deal and actually use them!
1.0,These Very Hungry Caterpillar socks are way to big for toddlers.
1.0,These are just terrible. The material is scratchy and you can definitely see through them. Returning ASAP.
1.0,Worst draft board kit ever. Poster was missing rounds and player stickers I got double sheets of same players and also missing sheets/players
1.0,Quality was horrible. The material was so sheer and the sleeves were so short??
1.0,"The bathing suit itself is cute and fits fine but it smells like cigarettes and even after multiple washes still stinks. It's supposedly new but as soon as I pulled it out of the plastic zip up bag it was in, it smelled like cigarettes. I can't seem to get the smell out. Should have immediately returned it instead of trying to wash it multiple times."
1.0,Color as described but much thicker sock than expected--not as soft and forgiving as needed. Also elastic band at top of sock too tight and confining even on very slender ankle.
1.0,After a couple days the pink starts peeling off. Dont waste your money
1.0,Yep 6 shirts.... however they fit short and are really itchy.
1.0,"Cheap fabric that doesn’t breathe, would be fine for a teen but looks immature on anyone else."
1.0,The concept of bracelet is amazing. The quality is horrible. The bracelet fell apart within hours of wearing it.
1.0,The watch doesn’t stay tight to the wrist so you have to keep putting the code in!
1.0,"American flag products should be made in America. Vendors should be required to disclose the country of manufacture in their Amazon product ads. Note: ""designed in San Diego"" or ""assembled in Ohio"" does not mean Made in the USA either!"
1.0,"Not Good! This cannot be brand quality Puma.  Where as a previous pant my son wore for two years before it wore-- this one , after ONE wearing developed a run and then a tear! Terrible quality. Also, the manufacturer phone no. given by Amazon, they didn't answer phone, gave a recording saying due to circumstances they can't answer phone. Amazon says it is beyond the return window. At least Amazon FINALLY made it right but I'm so so disappointed with Puma."
1.0,This dress has a very obvious seam right down the front middle and the pattern is off. It looks so tacky!
1.0,"I read the reviews and against my better judgment, got them anyways. They are just as cute in person as they are in the pictures which makes it 100x more depressing that they run like... 5 sizes too small...<br /><br />I’m usually a size 5, but because I wanted to be safe I ordered the largest size... it was like I was I was trying to squeeze into a size 1 lmao... they have NO stretch.<br /><br />I even gave them to a friend who is smaller than me, in hopes they could look cute on SOMEONE! But even she couldn’t button them!"
1.0,I ordered two of these for my sons and both broke.  Today I went to try and return and it's past the window.  Bad product for sure!
1.0,wayyyyyy tooooo big!!!
1.0,The picture is not accurate the dress is heavy and the skirt does not flail
1.0,This is advertised as a sweater but it is tee shirt material
1.0,"Had to hike it up to get it to cover my boobs, and straps kept falling off my shoulders."
1.0,"THESE CAME SO SMALL, I COULDN'T MAKE IT A WHOLE DAY WEARING THEM."
1.0,"They don’t look as elegant as the photo, they look pretty cheap and plastic in real life. I guess for the price what can you expect but wouldn’t have bought if I knew what they really look like."
1.0,Literally the worst shoes I’ve ever purchased. These came with a staple sticking up from the sole and tore my food apart. They were incredibly painful and NOT worth it.
1.0,Many spots on the fabric. Paper thin and horrible quality.
1.0,Sent back. Way to big. Could where as a  night shirt.
1.0,DONT BUY THIS!
1.0,To hard to figure out how to do the mold.
1.0,"My baby used these once, under close supervision, for 10 minutes. They were kept in a protective microfiber bag.  The second time I took them out to use them the arm broke at the end after I put them on my baby. I thought these were made of rubber?! I don't understand how these are supposed to be durable enough for a baby. Unfortunately a waste of money it seems."
1.0,"Not comfortable, arch support is tiny if there really is any,  and they are very wide."
1.0,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!! I would give 0 starts if i could.. Doesn't fit/look nothing like the picture..  Very disappointed!!
1.0,Too tight for long periods other than exercising.
1.0,"This thing is not made for thick people! My daughter wears mediums regularly, she couldn't get the medium up past her kneecaps. Lol."
1.0,I was very disappointed with the fit. The fabric Is a shinny material not of good quality.
1.0,"Expected something else, it's cheep so I don't complain, let's say that for the price it's ok, I only liked one ring"
1.0,The left pocket was folded over and sewn shut in place. The only thing that could fit in the pocket would have been a nine volt battery. On my third time wearing these shorts the zipper broke.
1.0,It is such an effort to put this thing on or off.
1.0,It came completely tangled. Returning.
1.0,I've bought it since I liked the color and the price but the strap isn't fitting into my Rolex  126710 or my 16570.<br />When I do make the spring bars to lock there's a gap on the rubber to the center of the watch lugs.<br />Save the money and get a Mr rubber or something more quality.
1.0,I wouldn’t buy this if you’re not a “petit” person.
1.0,"I ordered an XL tho I'm a size L. It was the size of a Medium. Tho pretty, I'm sending it back."
1.0,this is a knock off!
1.0,This face mask is too small for an adult.
1.0,"Purchased adult extra large. Look & fitted like a medium . I will be returning it , not reordering ."
1.0,This band came with two loops to keep the strap from dangling. The loops are of poor quality and they both broke.
1.0,Don’t waste your money! Way too long. Am 5’4” and looks like it’s 10 inches too long.  And size is way too big. Would not recommend for you to spend your money on this!
1.0,"This dress is for a wedding. It is too large in some areas and too small in others. Also is not the pink it says, it is more a peach color."
1.0,"So uncomfortable!  Weird pattern?  Way too small!!!!!!!!!  I wear a size 6, & there was nothing I could do to alter these to be wearable.  Don't waste your $$$$$$$."
1.0,It stunk horribly. I sent it back 😔
1.0,"They sent me a used bra! It didn’t have a tag, and it had little lint balls on it from someone’s shirt rubbing against it. I washed it and used it anyway, but I wish I just sent it back. It hardly supports my breasts at all. And, the material gathers lint, obviously. You can see the little balls through tight fitting shirts."
1.0,Color is not as pictured. Size up if you want a more relaxed fit as shown in the pic
1.0,I’m a D. Doesn’t hold up well. After 10 min it starts losing its grip and starts drooping
1.0,Very cheap and color is way off from the picture!!
1.0,"This isn’t sterling silver - it isn’t stamped 925 like is required of all sterling silver jewelry and looks/feels like silver-plated copper or alloy. The stone quality isn’t terrible but definitely not as nice as the image. I went w/ Anna Silver ultimately and was highly impressed, just as I have been in the past w/ them."
1.0,It's to small I order it big just in case and still was to small
1.0,Never got a chance to wear them... one of them broke when i was reaching into my jewelry box to wear them. Guess it’s not happening.
1.0,It doesn't fit nicely on your face and the straps are too thick. The material is uncomfortable.
1.0,The swim suit is really cute but it has stains in the bottoms looks like someone returned it after they put it on in that’s just nasty in why would you send this to me very upset 😡😡😡
1.0,"On strap that has a plastic loop at very end, there's no way to loop itself around as shown in web ad  photo..  If  there is, No documentation came with it to accomplish that"
1.0,The Advertised colors look like blue and hot pink but they are actually burgundy and pink which are the most horrid colors together. I sent as a gift to my daughter-in-law and was greatly disappointed and embarrassed.
1.0,"Poor quality dress, looks cheap. The fabric is really thin, not suitable for a dress for a grown-ups. The actual color is so far away from the color shown here I didn't recognize it at first when it came in. The sizing is OK. It fits the size chart, and the dress fits nicely. Except I can't wear it."
1.0,Arrived torn!!!
1.0,Too small and the adhesive is very low quality. I wore this in the winter with a long sleeved bodysuit that was backless. It didn't stick at all. I even thought it was a good idea to try it without lotion and that this would help it adhere more...no bueno.
1.0,At first I was very happy with it but sadly literally after the first use the handle popped right off I'm so disappointed by this
1.0,"These sunglasses look great, but they don’t fit over my prescription glasses as advertised. Like, not even close. My glasses are averaged sized so I’m surprised these dont fit over them. I think the product photos were misleading. Disappointed."
1.0,Very poor quality. The boots are peeling after 3 months of wear. My daughter had her precious pair of boots for 2 years and never had any issues with them.
1.0,"Quit after 4 months. I replace the pulley in movement twice, then the motor quit, avoid this and their look alike Chinese crap."
1.0,"Front was white but had splotchy, cream color on the front"
1.0,Shoe was not white. It was ivory. Wearing it with a white dress clearly shows it’s not white
1.0,"I purchased this dress last minute to wear for New Years Eve and it arrived on time (2 days before New Years Eve) and I was really happy about that. As soon as I tried it on.... immediately regretted it. I got a size x-small. I'm 5'1 and I'm usually a size small, waist is a size 24, bust is 34, and hip is 26. The dress had a stinky leather smell.. very cheap material. I didn't even make it work, it was just a very ugly dress that i could not salvage. Overall, very disappointed. I wished I took a picture of me in it, but I just couldn't wait to take it off because of the smell. Hope this helps."
1.0,Ugly material. Runs very small.
1.0,Cheaply made. Ugly button. Not at all the quality for the money.
1.0,These don't fit right.
1.0,"Runs small... fabric is not very comfy... thought is was going to be silky like the picture, it is more itchy fabric. I have a long torso and it was too short. Definitely not true to size even when following the size chart. Returning."
1.0,tried to put on and broke
1.0,Made my boobs look weird and was uncomfortable
1.0,"Al ponérselos se enrollan de abajo porque no se ajustan bien a las muñecas , no los volvería a comprar"
1.0,Would of been a nice anklet but the first anklet was already tarnished when I received it. Ordered a replacement and that one came tarnished as well. Now I can’t even get a refund I can only refund it to an amazon gift card.
1.0,"These slippers are cute, and came as pictured. However, they sole ripped almost immediately. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,Just a piece of cloth. Stitches are unfinished. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,These do not look like the picture.  You can't even tell what they are. Waste of money
1.0,...and now im swimming in it. seriously. this shirt is ENORMOUS. not even close to being as close fitting as the ad. waste of time to return. oh well.
1.0,Product is not as pictured.  Very poor quality and way too large to be worn on the lapel.
1.0,Not anywhere near correctly sized
1.0,Did not match the color and brightness of the photo provided in Amazon ad
1.0,Did not work. Broke on first use!
1.0,"Your colleagues will be asking, “Why did she wear her PJs to work today?!”<br /><br />I admit it, I was duped by the picture with the advertisement.  That lady looks so classy in these black pants and her high heels.  I would look like a crazy woman if I tried that--I’m pretty sure I’d get demoted, too.  These are poor quality crepe-like pants.  I would use the word sheer, but they are not quite that thin. I'm 145#, 5'6"", and got my regular medium--I'll let you decide based on the photos if they fit true to size, I say no. They are weirdly long in the leg, make your crotch (sorry, I couldn’t think of another word) area hang low, and drape weirdly in the back. They are very roomy in the hip area, adding a good 10 pounds on your frame.  If that wasn’t enough to convince you not to buy them, the waist is uncomfortable and has to be adjusted all the time.  There are pockets, and I love pockets, but if you put something remotely heavy in the pocket your pants could fall down (don't ask me how I know)--you’ve been warned.<br /><br />Just pass, please just pass, on these pants.  But, if you happen to buy them and look fabulous, please post a picture--I’m so curious if it can be done  :-)"
1.0,"I normally buy more expensive brands but was impressed by this watch so gave it a try as I thought I could use it for causal/sports wear.  Bought this watch 2 months ago and had battery problems from week 1. Even when is shows up as fully charged the battery drains in a day and then you need to keep it in sunlight all over again and go through this cycle all the time. I would have never expected this from Tissot. Took it to the service center who kept it for a week and then said its all fine. But once again the problems started.  I intend to go back to them, but really this is terrible for a reputed brand.<br /><br />I know I wont be looking to buy a Tissot again because it is just not worth the effort and frankly their brand appears damaged by such issues."
1.0,it's too thin.
1.0,too big but the nine is too small
1.0,"I ordered this for my son's birthday he was so excited to get it....he put it on over his shirt right away.  When he took it off 1 hour later to go play outside he noticed the name and number on the back of the jersey is peeling off.  And because there is a slight delay on some items because of the virus, I ordered it well in advance of his birthday to make sure it came in time.....hopefully I can send it back....he really still wants one."
1.0,"This product gets 0 stars. I received it today which was earlier than expected.  There is only 1, I thought there was going to be 2 but that may have been my mistake in reading the description.  It arrived broken, tangled, and links were not connected. It was a waste of time purchasing, I wanted it for my maternity shoot. Will be returning immediately."
1.0,I ordered a black one. When I received the package today it had a burn hole in it.
1.0,It’s nothing like the picture it’s silky like a bomber jacket not a Varsity jacket. Waist of money
1.0,"I normally wear a XXL. I couldn't even begin to button a XXL in this shirt. It is poorly tailored. And The ""light blue"" shirt is grey, not remotely light blue.  And the shirt is misrepresented: The model has his sleeves rolled up and it shows stripes. My shirt when rolled the same way, shows white. The shirt is remarkably thin as well."
1.0,"This bag costs $2 at HEB, its being over sold."
1.0,Run way too small
1.0,I ordered 6 packs and only received 3 needless to say I am not happy!
1.0,Very cheap looking ..don't buy
1.0,"It arrived soon but is too small, I will give it to my 15 years old granddaughter"
1.0,Certainly do not live up to the description!  All they manage to do is color the glare amber!  Too dark to use while driving would make driving extremely dangerous!!!<br /><br />For some reason Amazon thinks these are Shoes so can't answer the other questions  - but No they do not provide good arch support!
1.0,Fits great but one use and is already coming apart the seam of the pants in the first used began to break
1.0,"Within 5 minutes of using this mask, my toddler pulled it off of his face and the ear-loop part stretched and frayed (see picture). I would imagine for a child's mask that this should be more durable, I'm not sure how much longer it will hold together."
1.0,"These are really cute but whatever ""metal"" is used to make the post burns my ears within seconds of wearing. I have lots of inexpensive earrings that will hurt after a few hours of wear, but these are definitely the most uncomfortable ones I have ever owned. Too bad because they are cute!"
1.0,Faded after only 2 weeks
1.0,Dont bother. I bought a 4x for my 17 year old thinking there was no way it wouldnt fit but it came 3 sizes too small.  What a waste
1.0,Definetly not work gloves.  I used them for 2 weekends with what I would consider light work and they already tore through 1 finger.
1.0,The paint peeled off all the balls
1.0,"Ordered a large eventhough I usually wear a medium, but it was too small."
1.0,The look is great but quality is crap. After one day of wearing the silver plating wore off. Ring turn my finger too
1.0,"Different dress. The dress we received was the right color-but wrong design. There’s no sheer lace over the shoulders. The cut is different on top, it looks more like a halter top."
1.0,Product itself seemed decent.  Sizing is not.  I ordered a 5x because I wanted it bigger for sleeping and lucky if it was a 1x.  I usually wear a 3x.
1.0,The straps on this sandal where way to large causing them to fall off my feet. Returned them.
1.0,I used my measurements and everything. The product was way too small.
1.0,This is supposed to be a kids cap<br />It was too big and the window to return was short so now I'm stuck with a hat that doesn't fit my child
1.0,"If I could give these earrings 0 stars, I would. They are such poor quality. Cloudy & dull...absolutely no sparkle to them. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,It said it would be blamk but it says PARTY. Not exatly appropriate for my trip to Disney with my 2 year old. Not happy..Total waste of money.
1.0,Chain very thon and tangos
1.0,Cheap chain and the pendant sits in a weird position. Not good
1.0,"Nice looking earrings, but stem had bent in delivery."
1.0,Looked like pajama pants.  No way I would wear them out in public!
1.0,Ordered a larger size hoping I could get them on... but I could not even get the sock on the first foot...the compression was SOOO tight I couldn’t use my hands to put them in.  Am SOO disappointed. -  thought these would be such a good answer to foot swelling.
1.0,There is something like melted to the lens and the same lens is pooping out don’t stay in
1.0,"FABRIC TOO SOFT, IS JUST LIKE WEARING REGULAR T SHIRT"
1.0,Dress runs small. Otherwise nice. But the return window is 30 days and I thought it was 60 days. 👎🏼
1.0,I bought these and did not recieve six pairs and they are clearly childrens socks!!! Do not buy!!! You will regret
1.0,"I didn't care for this item.  I was really hoping they would have more stretch to them.  Since they were called Pajama jeans, I completely expected them to be super comfy, but they we snug and unforgiving.  I have other jeans that I think are more comfortable.  I sent them back b/c I didn't think they were worth the price."
1.0,Did not fit my daughter and was not able to return because of no return policy for sizes
1.0,Highly Disappointed!!! Do not buy!!!! Less than a week and the belt broke. So disappointed. This is second buy of the same watch from January 2019 which also broke. Cheap material on the belt. Avoid going through this hassle.
1.0,No pockets! The whole reason I bought it.
1.0,Followed directions to the letter but glasses fogged up the same as without the treatment. Very disappointing.
1.0,"While I usually love a nice ‘thin’ cotton poly blend t shirt, this shirt is cheap, flimsy ‘see through’ and had I seen it in the store I would have never purchased it. It is staticky and clings( and did I mention, totally see through 🙄)...and definitely will NOT hold up after a few washes.<br />Also don’t feel like it looks like the photo on Amazon (that one looks better!)...it has a light gray flat felled seam down both sides that stands out and isn’t flattering."
1.0,Quality was inferior. Nothing like the photo
1.0,It cam however the button on there cant hold a regular paper mas
1.0,"I am returning these. The quality is awful, the fit unflattering and the fabric is just this terrible unattractive cloth."
1.0,I did not like the fabric plus it was too small
1.0,Its cute but to small
1.0,Although they are beautiful straight out the box. Literally within days of wearing one. They tarnished and started to fall apart. Very disappointed in these.
1.0,Cane tainted with blood stains
1.0,i sent this product back because it looks nothing like the picture.  In the picture it looks like the buckle is separate from the shoe cover but that product I received was all one piece like the buckle was printed on the material.  It was not glittery at all is was a dark purple that almost blended away to where you could even see it.  Not worth it.
1.0,"El primer día que me la puse se le salieron los hilos . the first day I put it on, the threads came out the fabric is of very poor quality"
1.0,"Bodice too tight, length way too long by several inches."
1.0,"When ordering clothes; I have learned to order at least one size bigger.  However, the clothes still seem to be on the small size."
1.0,"These are cheaply made, way over-priced and only marginally effective in reducing wind noise. Basically a huge waste of money."
1.0,Ordered small and it fits like a toddler small... poor quality :(
1.0,One size fits all is not accurate.
1.0,All of the side boob on display. Soft fabric at least.
1.0,Poor craftsmanship and horrible feeling material.  Don't waste your money  on buying it and they will charge you to return it.
1.0,Very plastic looking and feel. If I had known it would be anything like this I would not have bought it. Took forever to get here from China. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
1.0,My daughter loved it for about 3 hours until it broke off the chain.
1.0,Was like a childs size. Will not buy clothes from amazon again.
1.0,"The packaging was not so good. The headbands arrived all crumpled and folded. I ordered these are return gifts for all the little girls coming to my party this weekend, and now I have to either iron out all the headbands to make them look crisp, or I have to give them in the crumpled state which makes them look used. It's ok for personal use but bad for gift-giving.<br /><br />Also, as someone else mentioned earlier, some headbands don't match the bows, for example the peach or the yellow. I ordered 3 sets of these, and in one of them, there were more mismatches than what's shown in the picture here. The teal bow came with a grey headband! Does not look pretty at all. I would not recommend this again."
1.0,My 6th grader picked out this backpack and it looked great when it came in. On the second day of school a huge hole appeared on one side of the backpack. A week later another similar hole on the other side. Looks as of the material is just falling apart. Such bad quality. I've never bought a backpack that has failed so quickly.
1.0,Not at all like described. Horrible quality and doesn’t fit well at all.
1.0,The pants were not made well.  The elastic is misaligned.  My son will wear them as pajama pants.
1.0,Horribly and cheaply made. Did not fit true to size and I’m sending it back right away!
1.0,Poor quality sequins popped off when trying on. Wish I returned but I didnt try on right away
1.0,It was nice but it broke the minute it came out the bag I was pissed 😡 Didn't give me the chance to even put it on for once
1.0,Unfortunately this purse proved to be very poor quality I received it in July and it broke well actually the strap broke before the end of August with light use.
1.0,This dress is awful it looks like a &#34;momo&#34; DONT WASTE UR MONEY!!!  ZERO STARS IF I HAD THAT OPTION
1.0,"I love this podcast and was super excited to get this necklace (it's so fun!) but the quality is AWFUL. Such a short chain that it comes with so I needed an extender for it to look normal. The actual ""Daddy"" part BENDS all the time with normal wear. It will definitely break and sometime soon which is such a bummer. For $40 dollars, this is SUCH a rip off. You can get a customized necklace that says the same thing for the same amount but that actually has quality. I bought this because I love the podcast but I wish there was a review like mine to keep me from doing that."
1.0,The sizing on this leo is way off.  I even went to their website and used the sizing info to measure my daughter.  She measured for a M (8-10).  I ordered the L (12-14) since the other reviews said it ran small.  She put it on and couldn't even stand up straight is was so tight.  The fabric is very thin and almost see-through.  Awful.
1.0,"I just received these in the mail and I was looking forward to wearing earrings that look like the photograph; however, I received earrings that look nothing like what was listed."
1.0,"Unlike what the description states as far as the product being breathable, this face mask is made up of two layers, one exterior and one interior.  The interior layer attaches to your mouth and  nostrils when trying to breath or speak making it difficult to breath. I will be returning this product."
1.0,"Bought 3 dress for my girlfriend.  She tried them on, and of course I ordered the wrong size. We were on vacation when they arrived so I tried to send them back 3 weeks after they arrived but was told I was too late!  Brand new dresses, in the bags, with tags on and at 3 weeks they would not take them back. Never again.  Ridiculous."
1.0,"These tights were not made the best and didn't hold up to wear, so they were returned"
1.0,Horribly made will never buy from this company again
1.0,the shoes was broken.
1.0,Wayyyyy too short in the back... Literally exposes my entire bum...I have to wear leggings with it rather than the panty hose I bought for it so I'm a little unhappy. I didn't fill out the return in time as I work 70hrs a week but definitely would have if I had the time. Waste of my hard earned money
1.0,The size is deceiving.  Toooooooo small for a normal adult.
1.0,"The pullover looks nothing like the picture, it’s not fuzzy at all. And when I tried to return it. You have to ask for permission from the seller to return it!!! Do not buy this product."
1.0,The shirt itself is cute but runs WAY TOO small!
1.0,Clips were not sturdy at all and broke so easily
1.0,Poor product! It came broken. Not worth the 17.99 I paid for!!!
1.0,"These are weird. The socks are short, so they slide off my heels. I wear a size 8 1/2. The toes are also short so my toes slip out."
1.0,"Crap quality, printed on one side chinesium"
1.0,"The day we received it, the letter broke off and unable to put it back on."
1.0,I bought these shirts for my daughter to work in. When she washed them they shrunk to about 2/3 there original size. I would not recommend buying this product.
1.0,Did not fit me.  To small
1.0,My experience with this company was very poor to say the least.  I knew they were probably on the small side when I ordered the gloves due to other helpful reviews.  They arrived promptly and were somewhat small but still fit well enough. The major problem I had was that I wore them once and a big hole ripped up the thumb side not on a seam.  I sent pictures and feedback to the company and they said they would send a replacement glove but never sent confirmation of the shipment and needless to say it never arrived.  That was in December of last year.  The replacement glove still has not arrived even after emailing twice to check.  I wouldn't want it at this point due to the poor quality and do not recommend this company at all.
1.0,wasn't a good fit. too chunky and short. also very see-through.
1.0,"This was a lovely ring, but sadly, the first day I wore it, it broke in half.  I wouldn’t buy it again."
1.0,"Are you buying an umbrella for those nice, long, rainy, uphill walks windy enough to push you into oncoming traffic on the streets of San Francisco?<br />BUY A BETTER UMBRELLA.<br /><br />I don't know if it's a flaw or intentional, but there's &#34;give&#34; when it's fully open, making it incredibly difficult to stabilize the umbrella in high winds. It also makes it hard to fix the umbrella when the wind turns it inside out.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm pretty sure I have a defective umbrella, AND it's a piece of crap with a cheap design. I straight up chose to just walk in the rain with my hood up in last night'a huge storm because I was so f***ing sick of fixing the umbrella every 10 feet."
1.0,"While these are described as polarized, a simple test showed that they are not polarized."
1.0,"Small size was way too small for my size 00-2 daughter, 5-8, 115 pounds,  medium was ok fit.<br /><br />Be careful, we have tried to return the first dress pursuant to the &#34;free return policy&#34; and free shipping on the return. The Seller would not honor and wanted us to pay the return shipping. No response to our emails regarding the deceptive return policy.  The Seller's complete lack of response has likely jaded my &#34;rating&#34; of the product, but coupled with the sizing being very small, it is fair under the circumstances. ."
1.0,TINY...very small...  maybe for a child
1.0,Doesn’t fit... and the material is super thin and not nearly stretchy enough.
1.0,El color se puso feo rápido
1.0,Absolutely horrible. Looks nothing like the picture. Very poorly made. Do not waste your time or money ordering these.
1.0,Color is dingy and shorter than expected.<br />For some reason I thought  it had slits and side pockets... but I could be wrong. It arrived with two black marks on the material material as well. I might’ve kept it if it hadn’t been for them.
1.0,What a joke. They do not work as advertised.
1.0,This is the 2nd one I have bought for my son. We got it on Feb 22nd and I got home to it was broke again today. So just over a month not a happy mom here.
1.0,I've bought several Casio watches over the years. This one was the first I wouldn't wear.
1.0,This shirt looks horrible. It’s like a shiny thin cheap looking fabric material. It’s not fitted or flattering at all. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Ugly huge bulky cheap looking
1.0,"I would not have purchased this at a retail store.  It is too heavy, does not have Velcro closure, but rather snaps that come undone easily.  I bought it for the crumb catcher, but not using it due to the other issues."
1.0,"I ordered a first Bostanten which was good. So I ordered again, same price but different seller. The name is stencil writing, the material color is lighter and the zipper works when it feels like. It is an utter disappointed for $100. They gave 10 dollar discount. It's not worth it. Spend the $10 or more to get something with quality. Wish I could give it zero stars. Disappointing."
1.0,This is after the first wash! shrank and the waist is reshaped and messed up. No way to fix it. So the overall quality is zero.
1.0,The child size didn’t fit my 4 year old’s normal-sized head and isn’t stretchy at all.
1.0,Dress was too large
1.0,El producto me salió dañado
1.0,"Clasp was broken when it came in, no way for the necklace to be worn. Returning"
1.0,"Ring Missing- says it was in package???!!!<br />I’m furious have an event and have the earrings and a pearl ring, but No emerald ring in package!!<br />I checked very carefully in package"
1.0,"Wrong size and style, plus seams seem to be imperfect"
1.0,Hi Band Broken pulled from Mounting Hard ware .
1.0,Very cheaply made. I ordered a women’s 2xl. When I received it it was more like a juniors m. Very thin and very cheap.
1.0,"Of poor quality. Seams are raw and unfinished, unravels quickly."
1.0,AWFUL! I was hopeful with the reviews that this would work but it was too small and SO awkward. DOES NOT look like the picture.
1.0,was not a nice red like picture showed
1.0,Cheap (obviously).  I have what most consider to be small ears and this still didn't fit me.  The head broke off immediately when I tried to bend it to make it slightly larger.  Maybe this earring is intended for the ears of 4-year olds.
1.0,These glasses did not darken at all.  I tried them on in sunny weather and did not notice darkening.  I tested them by wrapping one lens in a washcloth to block light and set it outside in full sunlight.  See the photo with the washcloth.  After 10 minutes I added my regular reading glasses to show contrast.  When uncovering the lens one would expect the covered lens to be lighter than the sun exposed lens.  It was not.  These glasses have a pale yellow hue to them as if they had a coating.  But sunlight simply did not change them at all.
1.0,They were made of plastic...awful
1.0,"This umbrella was horrible.  The box I received it in was thrashed and then when I went to use it, it broke in 3 pieces I never was able to use it even once.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1.0,"Cheap looking, thin material.  Does not look like the picture.  I hate it."
1.0,The shoes fit perfectly but I need a left and a right shoe to wear them not two right shoes. I don't have two right feet.
1.0,Very very long and super skinny tube sock not what I expected I would never wear them
1.0,"These were purchased for my husband to use while he worked. Unfortunately, they tore before he had a chance to really use them. Was disappointed as these were such a great bargain. Now I see why."
1.0,Did not like this at all. Looked different than pictured.  Too big and the material was cheap.
1.0,I am 5'8 and ordered an XL because I wanted a loose fit. This is made really small and is not made for taller ladies. It gave me a major C-toe if you get my drift.
1.0,If I could return these I would.  I purchased them for a dying project and even after pre washing they did not take the dye well which leads me to believe they are not 100% cotton.  I'm definitely bummed with the results and wish I had chosen something else.
1.0,"Super disappointed. I ordered an XL per measurements of the company, and they were so small they weren’t even close to buttoning."
1.0,Don't waste your time or money...horrible material & it looks nothing like the picture...
1.0,Worse dress I have ever bought. Looks cute on the Internet but when they send it to you it has half asked knitting and the hem stitching is terrible. It looks like a play house dress.
1.0,This ring looks nothing like the picture! Looks like it came from a candy machine
1.0,"I buy a lot of products on Amazon but this rates as one of my worst disappointments. Looks great in the picture but if you have ever bought a shirt or a pair of pants that wrinkle so bad you not only have to iron it every time you wear it but never quite gets rid of the wrinkle marks, this is it. Price great. Product cheap."
1.0,The stitching was letting go after 1st washing on cold setting ….
1.0,"Very attractive charm, yet the hold of the charm is not big enough to insert a standard size pandora bracelet."
1.0,Not happy with this at all. It says it's for a septum but the ring is way to small!!! Very angry.
1.0,"Couldn’t use, made incorrectly."
1.0,El vestido está muy bonito solo que la tela al sentarte se arruga de masiado
1.0,This fits very snug and it’s a very open weave. Which is very delicate.  I don’t know how long it will last. My bust size is 40” and I ordered the 8-10 size. I also wanted the shorter length and if I had chosen the 12-14 which is the next size up the cardigan would be longer and I wanted the balero style.
1.0,Great product...but size down. I ordered size 10 for my husband. And they came in size 10/11 so very loose -especially for electrician occupation. Neat design.
1.0,Is much smaller then an XL in womens
1.0,I ordered two of these and they are cheap and VERY small. Smell funny too!
1.0,"First off, this product took forever to get here, when it finally did arrive almost a month later, I had forgotten I had even ordered it, I ordered a small but the shirt fit as if it were a extra large, for reference I am 5’2, b cup, 135 lbs, the shirt has no shape to it, and looks like a tunic sleeping shirt, huge disappointment, now to try to return this thing"
1.0,So small and I got extra large
1.0,"Trash. Smaller than expected, thin as paper and had a run in it on arrival. Save your money."
1.0,looked like a green jail jumpsuit
1.0,GOld wore off in three days and then broke
1.0,"Horrible!  Watch size.  i ordered 3x thinking it might run small but it was huge and in a weird way too, very long ascwell, material smelled and was rough.  wanted to like this but returning."
1.0,Way shorter than photo. I have no idea what size I got. No label to tell me.
1.0,"This is comfy but not as pictured. The dots are HUGE,  which looks cheap and Minnie Mouse-ish. It is shorter than pictured also."
1.0,Pretty much impossible to put in ! Not happy with this product at all
1.0,If you use this on your bare skin you may have issues with rubbing sensitive part of your chest. The material is very rough  think sanding paper :(
1.0,To small.  fabric is gross.  Cheap.
1.0,"Lasts maybe a month , lens kept popping out"
1.0,Didn't last a month. Ordered 2/2 broke 2/25. Today at school the peace that holds the string onto the bag tore off and I had to carry my bag the rest of the day.
1.0,Cut badly
1.0,I wish I could put a picture of what they actually look like. Waste of money.
1.0,Didn't work well for me.... As soon as I put on lotion the clear plastic started to unwind.... :(
1.0,"I've bought other jewelry pieces from this seller, so I did not think that this one would be an issue in spite of such a low price. Unfortunately, I was proven wrong.<br /><br />The order came two days later than estimated and one day after promised with paid shipping. When the ring did arrive, the black heart stone had two problems: a deep scratch/crack on the underside near the point and the stone itself was not set properly. I don't know if it was damaged in production or in transit, but it's not good either way. Things came to a head though when the heart stone came out completely on the second day of wear. Unacceptable!<br /><br />I would not entirely write this seller off, but I also would not recommend THIS ring."
1.0,"They fit pretty large, would have had preferred if it had been a little smaller"
1.0,Very cheaply made. They are dollar tree quality... Don't waste your money.
1.0,Not the same print at all.
1.0,I ordered the largest size you had and it should have been larger than what I need and I could not get the shirt on. I normally wear a 2x or 3x. The only reason I gave it a one star us that I did like the material and style. Save your money.
1.0,Never again!
1.0,The wallet feels like cheap plastic. As soon as I tried to put my license in the card slot it ripped! I’m returning and staying away from this brand!
1.0,"Poor quality trinket. The plastic handle part is not on straight. It rattles, it's hollow but to add weight they put something inside that rattles around. The picture makes it look much higher quality than it actually is. Disappointed for the price, worth a few bucks at most."
1.0,It listed as free return. But the seller asked me to send back to india that will cost as much as the dress. The dress material is really cheap.
1.0,"After one time wearing them, the material ripped off the sole."
1.0,"Ordered a large which is what I wear from a target, but the cups are way to small. Still only for some one who is an A-B cup size not any bigger."
1.0,Stop working after two uses
1.0,"Fits super weird throughout. I’m 5’7”, fit, and it did not fit me well at all."
1.0,"Horrible. One longer than the other, not centered, flipped over"
1.0,Too small too short and not much stretch
1.0,"The band was NOT red, it was orange! Very disappointed!"
1.0,Flimsy thin material
1.0,The pieces would not stay connected when put into the device.
1.0,"This picture is stolen from a boutique. Use your own pictures! The model is from the boutique ‘Saved by the Dress’. Even IF your dresses look exactly alike, you should not be using their photos for your own advertisement. Pretty shady."
1.0,Great design BUT incredibly poor quality - watch falling literally apart
1.0,Not happy that I am I not able to return this product
1.0,It broke it about a week. What a waste of money
1.0,Malisimo la peluca se le caen los pelos y muy pequeña
1.0,"I'm usually a large or x-large. I ordered x-large, the largest possible size and it was still too small to even get on. This is ridiculous."
1.0,The suit was too small sent back 2 before the last one. The third one was bigger but still not big enough. I kept it tired of sending they back. Not satisfied at all!!
1.0,"Turned my fingers green without me using any water, lotion or anything. Just bring on turned my fingers green.😣"
1.0,"The waist fits quiet high like High waisted pants vs. gym sweats, so if worn on hips the legs are too long.<br />Not the best fabric"
1.0,"Frayed seams, back and arms were way smaller than expected. I usually wear a medium, ordered an extra large to be safe and it still wasn't as roomy and baggy as it looks."
1.0,This is absolutely awful!! It does not stay closed and now I can’t wear it or return it
1.0,You get what you pay for. The edges are so sharp that they cut into your finger. Very poor quality
1.0,"El pantalón se rompe con facilidad , no tiene calidad"
1.0,I didn’t like them because one legg was longer than the other
1.0,"It's very crapy. The smell is horrible, and the picture that I took speaks for itself. The heart is plastic made, and was cut smaller than the frame, but the worst for me is the smell. It smells like iron. I know that the price is cheap, but I think that the item could be better."
1.0,"I've had this ring since July and have worn it daily (as one normally wears an engagement/ wedding ring) I noticed tonight that the underside of the ring is losing its ability to retain its ""silver"" it looks like its pealing off. I'm very dissapointed and only now realize in the description under (metal) nothing is listed. Sorry for the poor picture its the best one I could take to try and show what was happening."
1.0,I really liked these pants when I received them but after only having them for 2 short months all the seams started to fray with the white elastic threads coming thru. I’m wondering if it was a defect because I’ve had a black pair that I’ve hade for 3 years with no issues. I would love to exchange and see but the one month return policy has past
1.0,Not as it was decribed!
1.0,"These are 8.1/4"" way to big for a child or woman unless the woman has very large wrists. I don't see a man wearing these, but then what do I know."
1.0,I don't think their large it the American large. so sad to pay for something you cant wear.
1.0,"The photos here are from Lauren Aston Designs from the UK, not this crappy acrylic version from who knows where. I’ve purchased and knit the real thing - watch out everyone!!"
1.0,Received this watch band on November 26th and have been wearing it daily since then. Initially it seemed well made and looked very nice but as of today (December 5th) the strap is already ripping where the spring bar sits and I fear it won't last much longer
1.0,I bought umbrellas for my kids for Christmas.  This was for my 13 year old daughter and as my 9 year old son easily opened his from a different brand she couldn’t open hers.  I went to help her to discover that it’s very very hard to open and feels like it will break with the first use.  She was very sweet and said she really liked the flower print inside but I told her it was ok and I’d be buying her a different one and she laughed in relief.  It’s cute but poorly made.
1.0,"Coat ripped on the first outing. It was much thinner than expected, and I was so disappointed."
1.0,Product arrived in a timely manner.  In attempting to use it the Detrapel Sneaker and shoe product NO SPray !!! I bought two bottles  BOTH did not disoense NADA!!!!!!  I trusted the product so as to protect very high end shoes  When I tried to return it a “this product is not eligible for return” notice appeared.  Now  I’m left no protection out $$$  I sent message thru Amazon to the vendor 4 days later no response.
1.0,This fit way too small and part of the leg was already unraveling when I got it. I would not purchase this again!
1.0,Won’t stay facing out. It’s basically a dollar tree necklace.
1.0,I seriously regret buying this it's HUGE !!!! I followed the size chart correctly but unfortunately I'm left with something I'll probably never wear
1.0,Very disappointed in quality. Looks like a hospital robe
1.0,Pic. Looks way better than what I get
1.0,Too stiff.  NO give whatsoever in the sandal.  No bend.
1.0,This is just a moisturizer wicking tank not a compression tank. This word needs to be taken out of the description for this product.  I was very disappointed when I found out it's just another tank.
1.0,"I hang dry these types of shirts to increase durability, but this one I was just not impressed with the print quality at all. I was cheap, but on sale for a reason, I think."
1.0,Broke before I had the chance to use it. Was removing the plastic tape from the band and a non removable link broke at the end. I was so excited about getting a ceramic band but unfortunately it didn't pan out. Very disappointing.
1.0,Toy only worth about 1$. Only about 12” long and flimsy.
1.0,Worst sweater I have bought in my like---very poor quality and not looking as pictured---sizing is off
1.0,"This necklace broke immediately, I didn't even have a chance to put it on. Pretty sure I've had jewelry come out of a 25 cent machine with better quality. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Save your money. The text wasn't lined up and was cut off at the bottom. Very cheaply made....I feel like this belongs in a dollar store to be honest. Return in progress!
1.0,"Very beautiful, its why I bought it.  after 1 week the band was so discolored and faded, after about a month it stopped working.  It is INCREDIBLY cheaply made.  This is not worth your money people. stay away."
1.0,Did not like at all.... Rubs way too big and not the same color... not flattering.
1.0,Glasses were broken when opened. Cheap plastic. Don't buy
1.0,"Supposed to be free returns.  Item is too small even though I ordered 2 sizes larger, tried to return, but company doesn't seem to know what is going on."
1.0,Ordered large. It had to be an extra small. Gave to my niece.
1.0,"I loved how pretty this bra was. It looked so nice when you put it on. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the quality of the bra.  Immediately after I tried it on the middle hanging beads started falling off.  Eventually, they all started coming out throughout the night.  Very very cheap material and does not last.  Did not return because I needed something fast for a Halloween party. You can see in the picture the beads falling out. If it was for the looks I would give it 5 stars but because of the quality of the bra I am only giving it 1 star."
1.0,Very disappointed that they sent me the wrong colors. I ordered gray/yellow (as shown in the picture) and they sent me blue and gray shorts. The material felt very cheap as well. I wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,Too large and the neck doesn't lay flat after one wash.
1.0,"Very cute. Other reviews were correct... order a size up. When I think of slippers, they should slip on. These don't, I have to work my foot into them<br />."
1.0,Looks really pretty in the picture but its equivalent to wrapping a bed sheet around your body and calling it a dress.
1.0,All of the Red Hanger Shirts look like rags after a cold handwash and drip dry. I bought quite a few for work. Now I have to send them all back. They smelled funny also.
1.0,Didn’t like this at all and it was too small.
1.0,"I thought from the description that this would work for my job in the desert. If it breathes at all, it doesn't feel like it and it's chafing to wear. Sorry I bought 2 without testing one first!"
1.0,"I ordered a size 8 and got what i believe would be a 4t. The material of this jacket is trash bag like, its cheap, poorly made."
1.0,"Cheap price, cheap looking.  Bought them, they arrived and I do not plan on wearing them. YOu get what you pay for though."
1.0,I wanted to use this blender to make my shakes. It just did not have the power I needed to crush the ice good. It took a longtime and just did not come out smooth. It’s very small however if you don’t need to crush ice it might work well. I love the glass idea of a personal blender. I did return the item. I really wanted it to work. This is the second one I’ve tried of different brands and the second one I’ve returned. Maybe it’s just not feasible to get the power I need in a battery operated blender.
1.0,The gloves are the correct size but when using them in hot water they are ineffective.  They do not protect you from the heat of the water.
1.0,Could not see out of these at all and they didn’t stick like other brands I’ve used. Return.
1.0,Too small didnt even fit kids face
1.0,PRODUCT BROKE UPON THE SECOND OCCASION OF WEARING IT.
1.0,Did not receive the correct item
1.0,"Lenses are bigger than i thought, doesn't look good on me."
1.0,"Hi,<br />I have to gave this gold chain 1 star, because this chain couldn't hold on with just a light tug. This chain was poorly solder. I wish I could found out before the deadline for return. I couldn't get my money back.<br />I didn't know until I used this chain for my rosary making.<br />If you the seller didn't know about this don't sell this anymore.<br />This chain is so bad I couldn't use for anything except melt it down or  send it to Rio Grande for scrap money.<br />I am sorry to write this note."
1.0,Lightweight and cheap.
1.0,"It's says real leather but it's not, so fake and waste of money. I bought 2 and regret it."
1.0,Very disappointed i was sent a used-returned pair with the tag cut from the inseam as well as the retail tags cut of the shorts.<br />overall quality seems to be cheaply made and i assume the shorts will not hold up well.<br />I will be returning
1.0,really poor quality for the price
1.0,I was really excited to try these leggings as all the reviews were great! When they arrived I tried them on immediately and they fit perfectly - I was so excited! Then I wore them one single time and I ended up with three small holes all about the knee and the stitching had completely pulled apart. So bummed!!
1.0,Pay a few bucks more foe better quality
1.0,The item arrived too small to wear. It was obviously a child’s costume but nowhere did it say this. Very disappointed!!!
1.0,"I like the style but, I wanted to wear this to my moms funeral but, received the wrong color. I ordered off white and received beige."
1.0,"Came with no instructions, the magnets detached from their casing so the magnets didn’t work whatsoever. I wound up just cutting the original laces & using the clamps included in the package to clamp the laces. I’d recommended just getting another brand"
1.0,"Doesn't work, wore with wadders wgile duck hunting in 29 degree weather feet still got cold. Had socks and insulated neoprene wadders in a blind not in the water, feet were coldest part of hunt."
1.0,"These beads are NOT malachite. I bought these back before the description stated they're simulated. Theyre not even....They're made out of clay. If anyone knows what real malachite looks like, you'd be a fool to think it even looks real. They don't even look like a natural stone in any way. Don't look like a fool trying to pass these off as a gemstone, you'll get made fun of by anyone who knows that rocks don't look like polymer clay."
1.0,"This dress was so cute, it was just way too big! The top gaped open and the skirt was way too billowy!!"
1.0,Cute but turns on you
1.0,Worn the belt like 6 times and the grommets are already breaking free.
1.0,"Fit was very odd. The push-up feels weird and uncomfortable in the bra. The bra did not fit flat against my chest no matter how much I tightened the straps. Clear straps are very difficult to tighten and loosen. Maybe if you have a smaller chest it would fit nicer, but for people with a bigger chest, everything seems to be spilling out of the bra. I ordered a 34C which is normally my bra size."
1.0,Too small not the correct size
1.0,I got something different than what’s shown.
1.0,"They bent this hat in order to ship it in a small package. Bending this hat ruins the structure so the hat cannot possibly be flat or function like a hat in the way that one would expect, it still has a permanent bend. I tried multiple things to get it to flatten out, placing between items to flatten, letting it dry flat, nothing will work because the bend has ruined some part of the internal structure of the rim. I’m sure the hat is probably great, if nobody ever bends it."
1.0,Looks nothing like pictured. Very very thin (and sharp). The engraving is very light. Feels cheap. Also my engraving goes right up to the edge. Overall not happy at all. A dog tag from the pet store would have suited better.
1.0,I bought this for my granddaughter for achieving excellence in an educational endeavor. She is  13. It broke the first time she wore it. I replaced it and it did the same thing. I definitely do Not recommend anything from this company!!!
1.0,"The band itself did not snap onto the watch in the way that the original one does. Additionally, the provided screwdriver broke after roughly 2 minutes of use."
1.0,"I am 110lbs I ordered a small and it is way too big, also the material is very cheap."
1.0,had to return them. were scratched when I opened the box.
1.0,"It's pretty much useless since the brand new light that came with it didn't work staight out of the package. I removed the plastic insert that keeps the batteries from contacting to prevent running out and...NOTHING. The shirt itself is nice, probably running a size small. I ordered the 12-14 year old size for my average height, lean 11.5 year old. It JUST fits him with no room for growth. I wanted to return it, but my son liked the style of the plain white box printed on it and thought it would show up nicely since there were going to be blacklights at the party. Now, it's just an overpriced black t-shirt with a white box since the light never worked. I held my phone light up to it to see if the white portion would glow....ehh. Maybe the pen light works better?...that is IF the light works? I would not buy again."
1.0,"Made my ears break out, the clip is too tight."
1.0,this took forever to get here and when it did it's paper thin super small the zipper is junk.  I regret this purchase 100%
1.0,"I am very disappointed with this onsie. I got this for my son and when I went to put it on him, I noticed that it was missing the snaps on the back side to snap it closed."
1.0,"Cute shirts, but the sizes all run different although I purchased the 14-16 size. I'm not sure what's going on with these t-shirt companies."
1.0,"Fabric quality is cheap and abrasive against my skin. I'm 5'3 and ample-bosom. The sleeves are too short,  and the fabric is not fitted. I agree that it appears frumpy on short average size.  The hoodie part does NOT even fully cover my head."
1.0,Unfortunately this was too short and shrunk when washed.
1.0,The s win suits are very small made.
1.0,"It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but I returned it because of the poor quality of the product."
1.0,"The American flag print mask was purple instead of blue??? And the battery pack just goes everywhere, very uncomfortable."
1.0,The image faded at the first washing and material developed a small hole. Very poor quality. Don’t buy it.
1.0,Size small. Cut was way off.
1.0,I ordered the 18' it was too short. It was two necklaces. For a child neck
1.0,"Latch pin broke on one of them on day one, but still useable. Other one shattered within two weeks."
1.0,"The watch looks nice and was exactly what she wanted, however the watch is junk quality. Tried to set the time and the pin will not do anything in either open or closed positioned. So she cannot use it as a watch. She still liked it enough to want to wear it, but after wearing it around for half an hour the metal banding connection of the watch bracelet broke and now is in two pieces. If you get lucky and your watch time can be set to the correct time then you might want to buy some super glue just incase... the bracelet is only held to the watch by some thin bent metal and nothing else. Also, the paint on both the bracelet and metal connections to the watch chip easily if you try to reconnect the bracelet. So find her something that won't break if her heart is not set on this watch."
1.0,Couple this was ordered for was very unhappy
1.0,"The clasp on this tarnished so badly by west number 2. I did not wear this in water, humidity, or anything else that would cause it to tarnish quickly."
1.0,"Loved the charm, but hate that it tarnished so quickly!!"
1.0,"Terrible dress. It’s very thin, more like lingerie than a dress. I do NOT recommend this product at all! Do not purchase it. Picture is fake."
1.0,"Does not say in description malachite is a bead. Bead is not polished, as description says it will be. Has cheap fabric cord for necklace.<br />Not worth the $."
1.0,The picture is misleading. You only get the see-through part which is too overpriced.
1.0,Thin and uncomfortable
1.0,Metal clip visible. No way to cover it up.
1.0,Fabric is heavy not soft or stretchy as the picture appears.  Not comfortable fabric. Not what I expected.
1.0,My daughter received this for Christmas and the rabbit fell off after only a few minutes!  Too bad because it's a very pretty bracelet.
1.0,Broke as soon as i got it. Didn’t wear it once. Waste of money and hoping to get my money back.
1.0,I bought them based on the size chart but they are at least 4 sizes too big. They must have been mis-labelled.
1.0,Since when did 100% cotton mean spandex added.  Stretchy yuck material
1.0,Awful material
1.0,My son walks and they dont light up even if he stomps I literally have to go in the shoes n take the soul out and press the button myself very disappointed
1.0,These are not ankle pants as shown!!!!
1.0,The colors are very pretty however it looks like a clown costume. I ordered a small as i am 5'5 145lbs. It would fit someone who's  5'7 150 ish. Returning item ASAP
1.0,I didn’t like it. the fabric or cloth is very hard and thick.
1.0,"These are, in theory, nice bands.  But the little tabs that hold the band together when on your wrist are not very secure.  I reached in the back seat of the car to give our dogs a treat and the band caught on the seat cover and very easily fell off.  Thankfully, it was not outside when I was with our horses or swimming in the river with the dogs.<br />I will try to put some velcro on them to see if that helps.  But if it does not, then I wasted the money on them."
1.0,Worst  belly ring ever. Don't waste your money!!
1.0,bad materials VERY VERY not worth the price
1.0,ALL LIVES MATTER
1.0,"If you lift more than 5lb dumbbells, get one size bigger! The dress is tight but my arms felt like they were glued to my side"
1.0,Rosemarie collection this is what happens after a month .
1.0,They were too tight for my head.
1.0,"Horrible sweatshirt, runs super small and uncomfortable."
1.0,Arrived broken.  Returned.
1.0,"The fit of this dress is just odd. Very matronly. It is cut skimpily, which makes the fit of the dress to small to have any flow, yet too big for it to be fitted. It just looks unintentional. Like a matronly dress that’s too big. No bueno."
1.0,"It smells like garbage, the material must be the cheapest they could find. Don’t waste your time."
1.0,Way to big; looks really strange on.  Will be returning this one.
1.0,"Incómodas tienen un filo cortante al caminar debían de tener esos filos de los bordes de la parte de arriba, con una terminación de algún material que no permita las heridas cortantes, muy bonitas pero desastrosas en los pies"
1.0,It is a very dull silver and when I saw the Apple brand it was such a stark contrast because the Apple brand was a beautiful bright silver.
1.0,"The case is cute, but too small.  I can not use it for its intended purpose.  When I first put it on my phone, it appeared to fit fine.  But, later, I noticed that I kept getting a message regarding turning off my phone.  I discovered the top of the case slightly pushes down on the on/off button of the phone.  The side buttons also do not properly align.  I can turn up the volume on my phone, but not turn it down.  Unfortunately, I already threw away the packing material or else I would return it."
1.0,VERY hard to get on and off - even with the directions they come with. Comfortable when on but not worth the trouble!
1.0,These pants are TERRIBLE. the material is awful and thin and they came ripped.
1.0,One sleeve is actually longer than the other and both sleeves too short. And length of the shirt  is much shorter then in photo pf the adversement.
1.0,I wear between XL and XXL. I usually go XXL because I like the loose fit. This shirt was way too short on the torso. It fit more like a crop top than a sweater. Returned to seller.
1.0,"I liked the color and it's comfortable to wear, but it ripped along the picture seam a month into wearing it. I couldn't trust it to hold my ID anymore. I will be purchasing another from a different company."
1.0,This bra was terrible and does not fit the dimensions stated.
1.0,"Very nice looking band however it catches on clothing or any fabric you tut h and rips is, I’m very sad this band didn’t work out for us :/"
1.0,Mustard yellow... Cheap material.. Just not what I was looking for.
1.0,It broke as soon as I took it out of the packaging
1.0,"I got this so I may try some martial arts in it, but it literally is falling apart after trying it on (not even really using it) a few times, it's literally a $40 halloween costume max there selling for way over price I could make this myself for like $30, it's  not a real kimono or hakama at all. The strings are falling out and the hakama is way too long (amoung other things, although not as bad as the kimono), not to mention just not good quality. I've tried on crap costumes that were better than this, I'd say its a borderline scam considering the conditions. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Length was perfect but sleeves were really tight
1.0,Didn't like it. Want to return it.
1.0,"Terrible disappointment! They are super short and run small. The bottom is very tight, almost as if there's a band hugging your leg. Description is not accurate. At least I got a good laugh when my hubby tried them on."
1.0,It’s not real implant grade titanium
1.0,Cheap material size to big too
1.0,After the first wear these boots scuffed up. I bought them for a special event. I was breaking them in. They scuffed on the school ground carpet. I emailed Dr. Marten and the warranty team calls this “normal” wear and tear. I am greatly disappointed in this boot. I have never had a pair of Docs have a mark like this until years of wearing them. They sent me a kit for future protection. However my boots will just look terrible for the purposes they were purchased for. I don’t think they will be my choice shoe anymore.
1.0,I’ve got 2 stones not 3. One stud came with brown and yellow ish substance stuffed inside like it has been used through someone else’s pierced hole. I don’t even know how this passed the quality control. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,"Sewed backwards<br />Poorly made<br />Brought some different venter and same thing , Believe its same venter using different name<br />Wasting good hard money on products not worth using"
1.0,"There is absolutely no stretch in the denim, and the pants run smaller than expected. I ordered a size up and they were still too small."
1.0,Terrible quality. No shape and material is cheap and itchy
1.0,To small and took forever to arrive
1.0,"I bought these with very high expectations. However they are very cheaply made...the flowers are glued on and therefore flop on the band, the flowers and lace band has threads hanging off. They don't even fit my 6 month old, the bands are all stretched out.<br />Too expensive and waste of money!"
1.0,"It wasn't the correct color that I needed so I did return it, thank you!"
1.0,Wry poor quality.  Ordered a size 3X and it is like a size medium.  Made from very cheap material. Rip off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
1.0,I am now on our second pair and the buckles are junk.
1.0,"Wrong wring, have dispute may times for months"
1.0,"I have the light color purse, bought last January, and it is very discolored from where it was in contact with my clothing. Also, the metal tab that holds the zipper pull on the top broke, making it hard to zip and unzip. This purse is a waste of money."
1.0,"I typically wear an XL or a 2x. I ordered this in 4x because I wanted it to be loose and flowing like in the photo. Its so small, not even what a size large should be. Veey disappointed. its a very thin t-shirt type material. Nothing at all what I expected"
1.0,"Okay ladies, I read reviews about this before deciding to get it and I went for it... do yourself a favor and DONT. I usually wear a L-XL in pants and 38D breast. I got the biggest size available in the pink two piece and it was still too small. The bra barely covers the nipple- had ton on spillage and when you try to tighten the straps, the back goes way up your back and it so unflattering. The shorts- which I really was looking forward to, were so tight and NOT HIGH WAISTED. There was so much camel toe it wasn’t even funny. It barely even covered my butt.<br /><br />Now, I’m sure this would probably work for a girl who wears a size 0 pant and a 32A bra... but for a woman who wears 12-14 pants and a 38D bra, it was a huge and disappointing NO. Totally regret buying. Hate returning by mail, but I guess I have no other choice. Ladies with curves, DO NOT BUY"
1.0,No - not what I wanted ! Would like to make a return .
1.0,"The fabric is so thin, it’s truly a waste of money for this dress."
1.0,It just was so small once I put it in it couldn’t be seen properly
1.0,I got this for my 11 year old. She loved the style and color BUT when she tried it on it stuck to her body instantly. The static was too much to be dealing with it. We live in AZ where there is almost no humidity so maybe that could be the issue. We had to return it. I wish it was cotton fabric.
1.0,I bought a them in the exact size I already have. I bought my original ones at Gordmans. The online pair is about 3 &#34; too long.
1.0,Not as described! Poor quality. Only a single prong on back; the pin that was supposed to keep it on fell off when I opened the pkg. Would not stay attached. Disappointing!
1.0,"This is a joke right.?...anyone that has given a good review for this item, (I do believe, after reading all of these reviews)..<br />Is... &#34;A&#34; FAKE/LIE/BULLS#@%/etc....BY someone that has a stake in the company or a paid employee who has been promised a promotion or trying to help someone that got stuck with a crap load of these after going to market and getting taken ..THEMSELVES & PASSING it on to the customer ...I MEAN COME ON&#34;...... REALLY.?........FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN.. Over 96% of these reviews for their description of the &#34;CHAIN&#34;, CALL IT, EITHER... &#34;A Cord, or String &#34;....THEN There's even someone, explaining how......<br />&#34;The ends of &#34;(?)&#34;.......Came or frayed apart..&#34;WHAT&#34;!!!...OR how about the lever  breaking on the clasp and disappearing within itself.....hah!!....&#34;WHAT&#34; CLASP?....THERE ISN'T ONE..

1.0,I returned this - I was looking for a cotton t shirt and this was mostly rayon
1.0,"So I looked at that picture and just iMAGined my wife in that outfit. She has ...ummm, attributes... that would do well in this very low cut T. Alas, shirt arrived and the air went out of my excitement as I laid it on the floor (pic), aghast at the height of the neckline. Then my wife came upstairs, saw it and liked it before I could snag it and return it forthwith to the Farktop Store. UGH! Now, as she wears this rag to bed, I'm certain there are nuns out there who would find this ideal sleep attire. And ""to sleep"" is what it puts me. Bad form, Farktop Store! Bad form!!"
1.0,"I ordered for a present and it was way too small for an adult.  I had to buy another present.  I loved the t-shirt, but unfortunately I don't know of anyone who is that small and I ordered and Xlarge."
1.0,Bought this for myself and went a size ul since it said it runs small. I gave it to my 7 yr old daughter who it actually fits lol
1.0,Awful!!!  Please don't waste your money.  This swimsuit looks great in the picture.  But I am 5'2 and 113 lbs.  I ordered the medium and it looked like I was stuffing myself into a sausage casing!!  The latch on the back of the bikini top does not hold tightly and this made me fearful to ever wear the top.  I would suggest looking elsewhere for a swimsuit.  This item will only disappoint you!
1.0,"These socks are useless. They are very tight around upper calf (and my legs are not big :) and almost no compression around the lower calf, where its needed the most. I am returning them."
1.0,The gloves are for small children not adults.  Please don't waste time ordering. I am average sized women and could not squeeze into these gloves.<br />So disappointed and needed gloves for a costume.
1.0,"I read the reviews and was convinced it must be a good belt. When i received it I noticed the clasp does not properly secure, and will the belt will come loose."
1.0,Cheap materials for the price. Returning.
1.0,They were very low cut!
1.0,Super junky! They are like reg safety pins- super sharp!?
1.0,Didn't last a month before the lining started fraying.
1.0,"this was advertised as leather, but was cheap plastic I think the plastic bag it came in was thicker than the plastic coat. The buttons are chromed plastic USELESS. Waste of time and money. This is a big rip off basically fraud as the description of the coat and what you get are completely opposite. You expect a coat and get a cheap garbage bag with cheap buttons . Not even good enough to be a costume I gave it 1 star because it wouldn't accept my review without it but it really deserves a minus 10 stars. To return it it would cost me as much to ship it back as it has to be shipped back to china on your dime. Honestly the worst item I have ever purchased in my lifetime.  Complete GARBAGE!!"
1.0,"The shirt length is short.  The sleeves are short.  Quality of the tee is decent.  BUT...the image on the shirt is junk.  It’s feels chunky, super stiff and poorly done.  I paid $25 for this with tax.  I wouldn’t have paid $5.  VERY disappointed."
1.0,My daughter ordered a small and it fits me! I’m 6’ and 190 lbs. This shirt is terribly oversized.
1.0,Very disappointed. The package came and the button was lose in the bag. It wasn’t attached to the pants.
1.0,Muy mal
1.0,Super thin material.  Sent it back
1.0,Made for -0.  Sizing is really off.
1.0,"* update .. re ordered hoping that my order wouldn’t be so botched this time . No luck . Out of FOUR of the same exact order , ZERO came back matching the picture, and ZERO came back matching each other .. once again , neither even slightly match the dress I bought to go with this order . Literally a waste of time and money and they shouldn’t be on prime AT ALL .<br />This purchase was an absolute JOKE . I ordered two of the same item that is pictured . One as a head wrap , one as a shawl to match . I got two completely different patterns , and neither of the patterns match the one pictured , not even as far as colors . My dress I purchased to go with it is an entirely different color from both scarves I received . Completely dissatisfied"
1.0,Runs very small especially in the arms.
1.0,Not even close to a 3x. Too Small.
1.0,Did NOT receive. The gift is not in the box.
1.0,"size is way too small...I usually wear a US large...this is an extra small.  2 sizes too small...Material is also very thin.  Very disappointed.  This is also a ladies coat..not a mans coat...the zipper mechanism is on the left side...mens jackets have the zipper mech on the right side. Might explain why the sizing is so wrong...as these are womens sizes.  The term &#34;Mens Tailored&#34; is deceptive (as everyone don't know what that means)...and with only reviews by men...it made it quite confusing.  heads up: &#34;Mens Tailored&#34; is women's clothes fashioned in a mans style.  Tru Clothing is working with me to give me a full refund (including shipping) on this item, and is sending DHL to pick the item up from my home at no charge.  They are doing the right thing here."
1.0,I am usually a small to a medium depending on brand. I ordered this for a 60/70s themed party. The dress is so loose that I am not able to wear it. It’s a cute concept but these sizes must be wrong. Would not recommend. I am 5’1” 130 pounds as reference.
1.0,"The straps were poorly put together. One completely unraveled while she was trying it on. Looked as if they didn't even try to sew it into place. Even if I could've adjusted the straps, it still seemed to be too low around the chest area; it fit just fine everywhere else. But, I guess, you get what you pay for."
1.0,Only gave one star would give zero if I could. I usually wear a xl but ordered a xxl to have a little more room. They ended up sending me xl but it runs small so it doesn’t fit. Tried to return it but it came from overseas and they charge over $100 to send it back.
1.0,"While I like the style of this bracelet, the clasp doesn't stay closed and after a few days it fell off my wrist never to be seen again. The leather strands of the bracelet twist easily allowing the clasp to slip free. Also, the clasp itself is clunky and scratches easily. I bought the silver and gold versions of this bracelet and experienced the same problems with both. This needs a magnetic clasp."
1.0,Came with the stems flesh against the earring . Don't waste you money!
1.0,The fit was way too large nothing i can wear. I purchased a size medium.
1.0,Does not fit an adult wrist.
1.0,The size was off by two sizes.
1.0,"**UPDATE** I have now had this purse for a month and both straps broke. Will be returning.<br /><br />Love this purse! The quality is great for the price and there are plenty of pockets and sections. I agree with the other reviewers that the lining is kinda ugly but at least noone sees that part. I can CONFIRM that this purse will not fit a bill sized wallet. So if you have a wallet that can store dollar bills flat without folding, it will not fit in this purse. I just switched out wallets because I like the purse so much! Just like the pictures."
1.0,Not made very well fell apart on first wear.
1.0,"Ordered and extra large ... either they mislabeled or it runs extremely small, it’s more like a small-med"
1.0,"Too small, didn't fit right. I returned it."
1.0,"never got this one, i was sent the one with one pebble which is a total of 3 around not 6 around"
1.0,Aweful!
1.0,I was very disappointed because they did not meet the deadline.  I needed the product on the due date because I had an event.
1.0,They seem to block precisely zero solar rays. Maybe I’m wrong and the UV is cut out. Either way it was still bright as with them off while using them. They looked so promising too.
1.0,Came broken and had to return.
1.0,The measurements suggested don’t match no where near the size of the actual dress itself.
1.0,got it didn't look like the picture when she put it on
1.0,"I purchased these to replace 20 year old shorts purchased at Kohl's for leisure and workouts.  The pockets are designed in a way to defy using them.  One cannot put their hands in the pockets and extracting a phone or a set of keys is nearly impossible due to the design.  The Paul Jones lettering came off on the first wash done correctly per the label.  The side stripe fabric has worn through  in several places in the first couple of hours of wear prior to the first washing.  Very strange.  I wonder if the designer and manufacturer were trying intentionally to anger purchasers.  It was not incompetence -  Once could not do these things unless they were trying to do them.  I just cannot figure out the motivation.  They fit fine and thus earned one star.<br /><br />Update now that I have washed the shorts the second time:  The fabric that is the side stripe has worn through all along the edges.  I do not know if the shorts will fall apart but the white backing has worn through the dark surface fabric all along the seams.  They look really bad.  Too bad I cannot reduce my rating from one star.  I cannot figure out why any manufacturer would sell a product that has no durability at all.  They should try a pair for one week, wash them a couple of times, and see how poorly they stand up to very gently usage."
1.0,"This is awful, cheaply made and unattractive, and its the first thing I bought that I couldn't return."
1.0,Horrible!  Do not buy!  Stains anything it touches.  Color transfer is horrible and not easy to remove!
1.0,Did not care for the way it looked when it arrived. Return was easy.
1.0,"This product does not fit properly. Very cheaply made. Embroidery is not symmetrical on the dress. Sleeves are much more bulky and shorter than pictured. The back does not lace up as pictured. Very tacky looking on. And the odor of this and I order two different sizes, smells disgusting."
1.0,"The product is fine but the letter colors I received were not like the ones pictured. I REALLY needed the pink A's and the green K's. Super disappointed, I could not use them at all."
1.0,"Glove punctured after using for dishwashing for a week.  Would not have paid that much for this brand of dishwashing glove,  and feel that the seller should send me another pair or else reimburse me for their cost."
1.0,Had to rip out and completely replace lining within two weeks in order to keep using purse. Don't waste the money.
1.0,"The jacket had a terrible, rotten, chemical smell.  This company does not pay for returns, so I had to try to wash out to smell or throw it away.  The smell did not come all the way out and the jacket started to fall apart after its first wash.  Also, the sleeves are too long."
1.0,This dress is thin and shows every single bump and roll.....it is even to thin to wear shape wear underneath.  I tired all forms of shape eat and it all show through this thins fabric. And the dress was too big.  Not very flattering at all.
1.0,Shoulders too narrow.
1.0,I had to return skirt way to big!!!!
1.0,Didn't really like these. No pockets and the hair stuck right to them.
1.0,Super Cheap material and looks way better on the model.
1.0,Barely covered my boob. I am smaller chested and it was tiny on my boobs
1.0,Was birthday present broke clasp not impressed
1.0,"Received the head, never received the feet, even after inquiring.  Head is great.  My son and daughter love it."
1.0,Too hot not comfortable
1.0,Front glass was broke out of necklace when it came to me.
1.0,This item was too small and the quality was very poorly made.
1.0,"Bought as a gift, fit as expected before the wash then shrank about two sizes after the wash. The material is also very stiff, rough, and itchy. Will NOT be ordering this brand again."
1.0,Horrible i received it with one of the nipples covers missing so I only got one very upsetting I have large breasts and it did not fit right and it doesn't look good with a shirt on I want it to be discreet but it's really is not don't waste your money on it I wanna RETURN IT AND GET MY MONEY BACK WHAT A WASTE !!!!!
1.0,Is not really turned my neck green
1.0,There is no shape to the outfit. It is not flattering at all. Looks like it was home-made more than store bought.
1.0,I would never buy this again. It wont stay closed and what ever I put in it falls out.. I should of sent it back
1.0,Snaps broke after a month of use. Contacted company and haven't received any feedback.
1.0,"It should be noted that I purchased the ROMWE Women's Varsity Striped Heathered Sweatshirt in Black. When I go to my orders and click on it to leave a review, it brings me here. This doesn't look like the one I ordered, but if it is the same quality, beware. It isn't like a sweatshirt. It is more like a long sleeve t-shirt. I bought a size up (Large) because I read the reviews about it being a bit small.  It is still small.  I think I could have ordered an XXL and it would be tight in the arms."
1.0,"These popped right off my feet.  Also, they're unreturnable, so I can't get a refund.  That was an especially disappointing surprise."
1.0,Cute but really cheap.  Most broke within same day.
1.0,"Ordered XXL since I'm on the plus size, and it would not go on. I'm a 16-18 and it was too small."
1.0,"Did not receive the right shirt. Supposed to say &#34;baby bumps first christmas&#34; but instead it says &#34;eating christmas cookies for two&#34; & now there is not enough time to fix this, as christmas is only a few days away. Very very disappointed. Im already fat and pregnant, I dont need to draw more attention to that with a shirt that talks about &#34;eating cookies for two&#34; so thanks for nothing."
1.0,"This item should be removed! Look at what it's titled...&#34;GENUINE 925PURE STERLING SILVER STAR DUST FINE INTERTWINED BANGLE BRACELET&#34;....UH NO, it's not genuine, nope it's not silver, it's not stamped 925 and it's a piece of junk. I felt robbed when I opened it. It has a silver finish that I guarantee will begin turning the first time it's ever worn. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM,"
1.0,Don’t buy this product. It would have fit nicely but there are no button holes for the buttons!! Totally bummed.
1.0,These earrings are made cheap and looks completely different than the picture. Took a month and a half to receive and came from Malaysia which wasn't told when I bought them. Very disappointed.
1.0,It was too thin! Couldn't tell from the photo when i ordered the chain that it would be that thin!
1.0,I got a wound on my ankle from these stocking. Very difficult to put on
1.0,In reality it’s smaller than pic<br />Material isn’t the greatest<br />I think there are better options out there
1.0,"Even though I followed the chart provided by the manufacturer and read the reviews to estimate size, it was still about a size too small."
1.0,Too boxy looking on me.
1.0,This shirt runs smaller than size stated.
1.0,Subtle enough for daytime and dressy enough for evening.
1.0,Not sure what you can wear under this outfit that can't be seen.  It is very transparent.
1.0,"VERO MONTE socks weren't as promised. Not true to ""truly no show"" for one.  The one star is for at least having material comfort. If you have pain on your feet or toes due to an autoimmune disease, sensitive toes, or ingrown toenails these will hurt. The sock pulls on the front of your toes. The socks felt tight upon try-on the first time. However the rest felt stretchy and comfortable throughout. Only issue is the front part that seems to put strain on the toes due to the design. My foot size is 6.5."
1.0,Very odd fit...bunches up at the chest area...very unflattering!! Complete waste of money!
1.0,Hard as a rock soles. Skip.
1.0,"Just received theses in the mail, first is one is very thin and looks to be smaller than most and they are an ugly brown color not black. I’m sure I just wasted $12.00 on this purchase."
1.0,"poor quality and i only got the green one. the tiny package it came in said it was two pieces but there was only one piece in the bag. quite frustrated, not worth the money."
1.0,Watch was purchased a month ago and my daughter loved and within a month it is completely dead. Will not turn on.
1.0,Tarnished after a few days of wearing
1.0,Simply Uncomfortable.....
1.0,I am plus size woman. I have always been. So I dress and buy my clothes knowing this. I know to order the size that will fit cause that will look better than buying the size that sounds better. I bought a 4X I wear a 3X thinking one size up would be good. Nope not even close. Not even a hope. A waste of money. They are maybe a extra large . I had already removed the tags and thrown away pkg. Before I looked at the size. So dissatisfied. Do not buy it.
1.0,Started to tarnish shortly after purchase
1.0,"I bought these for my son and he wore them one time. When he went to squat down they ripped, but not a small rip like you’d see if the pants were too tight. They ripped completely down the legs. The material was very flimsy and low quality..."
1.0,These shirts are NOT fitted and NOT true to size!!! It is false advertising and should be renamed!!!
1.0,ONLY ONE PAIR HAS THE SILICONE STICK!!! Poor fabric. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,This is cheap horrible quality not worth the money spent for it. Started turning black in just 2 days of wearing it.
1.0,I gave it 1 star as it is cute when it works. But it’s very poor quality. It didn’t last 5 days and the strip with the lights peeled off. Had to throw the shoes away as there was no way to repair them !!
1.0,I’m very disappointed about this item. It’s so pretty but I wore it today and it turned my ears and neck<br />Green.
1.0,The pins don't fit my watch.  I did not buy the wrong size. The pins are more for a 46 not a 44
1.0,"Cheap, itchy, see through fabric"
1.0,"Only because I have to give a star , I gave one . These arrived in a timely matter , the material was nice and soft . The cup size is WAY too small . It is very difficult for me to find proper size bras , so i was counting on these to fit . Very disappointed  . I returned them . Do not waste your time or money . Sizing is incorrect!!"
1.0,"Cute shirt, but was way too small"
1.0,"They looked great when we got them, but after one practice they got ripped up. We had another pair of socks that lasted 2 months. Not sure what was up with this pair."
1.0,Came early but I ordered a size large and received a size 5x. They are huge. Cannot wear them.
1.0,I ended up giving it to my friend’s 9 year old daughter.
1.0,WAY too small and don’t stretch enough at all. I’m 5’5 and 130 lbs and I could not pull these past my knees.
1.0,"The scissors in this kit are horrible tried using them and they they dont even cut, their more like tweezers pulling your hair. For the price i  didnt have high expectations, but this was bad!"
1.0,Very small... Leather is real but poorly crafted... I do not recomend this necklace.
1.0,Package was delivered several weeks ago. Bracelet smells very bad. It made my entire house stink. I've tried baking soda and charcoal in a zip lock bag. Also tried soaking it in baking soda. Will not buy cheap jewelry again off the internet. Not worth it.
1.0,"This thing was thin, I mean really thin, like one of those loaner safety vests. I guess it's a sweatshirt because it looks like one. If your looking for something warm, this is not the one. folded several times it's probably as thick as t-shirt material. It was very bright. The smell o china was so strong, I washed my hands 3 or 4 times and it was still on me."
1.0,Smelled like straight up pee
1.0,"I’m sooo mad, during the Lock down i begin to do online shopping so i purchased lots of clothing off amazon but i didn’t really look at them for damages . Fast forward ...... i went pull this outfit down to wear and it’s ripped and it’s too late to return it. Im too mad and it’s too big so i could’ve have wore it and stretched it"
1.0,"This band broke within one year. After the color wore off. At the point where it joined with watch so it could not be fixed.<br /><br />Initially, the length fits my wrist great without binding or pinching with nearly constant use. Color is really nice for a plastic-like and pricey band. Dirt wipes off easily. Was concerned with silver slider on a gold colored watch but is easily overlooked. It's nice to have watch fit well, not sliding around. Have had no issues yet but haven't had it long,either. Am very happy with it."
1.0,Huge & horrible
1.0,"This bracelet is cute, but very cheaply made. Immediately one of the charms fell off and the wire bent making it difficult to close. If it had been five bucks, that would be okay but this was $27. I didn't expect a lot but I did expect better."
1.0,"Very cute, but not very functional. I feel like they're too open on the sides so they don't do much to block sun out of your eyes. I only wore these a couple times before giving them to my toddler."
1.0,Faded after five days
1.0,"I ordered this product twice, it runs very very small.  I ordered a size up originally, returned it, and then ordered a size up from a size up and it was still too small."
1.0,"This is an ok sweatshirt, but it is m9st definitely not off shoulder. It's a regular crew cut sweatshirt. Don't buy if you are looking for what is pictured because it is not what you will receive"
1.0,Broke within a week.  When first got it one side would not go into the watch and would get stuck half way in. The pin the holds the strap on bent just from normal use and the part that holds into onto the watch broke and doesn't stay in place.  The fabric stretched out a little as well.
1.0,"Super thin, returned it"
1.0,"I guess I have child like dimensions because not even the slim fit stayed up around the base of my skull. The color is also more purpley, not white as depicted here. Something else I didn't take into account is that when it is bunched up around your neck, you can't see the designs on it very well, and it just looks like a bunch of lines everywhere..."
1.0,"While I fell in love with the style of this dress, it is soooooo see through. I could even see the outline of my nails when I put my hand it in. Sucks cause it’s a cute dress but after reading reviews that it wasn’t see through I expected that. Disappointed!"
1.0,Worst purchase I have made in years.  Runs small. Frayed ends and loose threads. Flower is off from where it should be. Overall disappointed...
1.0,Horrible quality washed it once the gold completely washed off
1.0,Diamond is too small for price
1.0,It was way to big. And had rips.
1.0,1 set of earrings.<br />Very misleading as most would expect a set to include matching earrings for BOTH EARS...absolutely ridiculous and worthless.<br />I'll be returning.
1.0,The product became very rusty.
1.0,Very poor quality. It came sewed up in a knot. I returned this top.
1.0,Ripped in the seem first time wearing. Want my money back ASAP!
1.0,Not as pictured  and was huge
1.0,Waaay too small. This is more Asian size. Great quality just wish it fit.
1.0,"The itme came much sooner than expected BUT it arrived damage, chipped, falling apart in one place, and practically falling out of the box. Nothing keeping the piece safe. The bars that you mount the belts to are splintery and jagged. The name is just a sticker or decal type thing. For nearly $65 I'm pretty disappointed.. I wish I could have at least gotten one that wasn't broken and/or splintery."
1.0,I definitely should have read the reviews before purchasing!
1.0,On the website they claim to be real wood. They are not. Definitely not worth the money.
1.0,It's way to short. It's more like a shirt than a dress. And I ordered one size bigger.
1.0,Nice sewing but sizing not accurate.  Too many returns.
1.0,"I purchased  4-5T, but I received it that was sized 90cm.<br />I supposed this one for 2-3yaers old.  Color was more lighter than screen.<br />I returned it."
1.0,Page says cotton.
1.0,It's very thin and the gloves don't fit right.i wouldn't buy again.
1.0,Product is way too small do not waste your money on this item
1.0,This fit better than the first one but was poorly made the first one ordered fit amaizing but a bit too snug for my age
1.0,"The color faded the first day my daughter wore it. Poor quality, don’t buy it."
1.0,bra was not supportive
1.0,Beautiful charms but Clasps are much too small.
1.0,The magnet would flip so the silver magnet showed. The pic shows a girl with it in her nose. The directions when I received it says not recommended for nose. That’s why I bought it. I never got to wear because as soon as I got it in place the diamond would flip. Frustrating
1.0,The pants didn't fit. The bra area were too spaced out. .
1.0,Fit is way off. Super small
1.0,WEIRD
1.0,This turned my finger green within the 1st week
1.0,What the send is a knock off of what is in the image. The shade of pink on the sleeve and pocket DO NOT match the pink on the rest of the shirt!!! What?!? It's a dusty rose on the main part of the shirt and the pocket and sleeves are a hot bubble gum pink
1.0,"The size chart is wrong. RUNS VERY LARGE. In the item description the size chart says &#34;Sizes: Small (0-2), Medium (4-6), Large (8-10).&#34; I am 5'7 and about 135-140lbs. I generally wear a size 8 and I have wide hips. This skirt in large is WAY too big. Also, the skirt has three vertical seams. One down each side (which is normal), and one down the middle back of the skirt which is just weird and probably unflattering if the skirt fits right. I only buy clothes from here with free returns because you just don't know what you are going to get. This is being returned."
1.0,"Great price, but looks nothing like the photo. You get what u pay for....truly ugly!"
1.0,This coat runs very very small. Order 2-3 sizes up. Don’t expect a battery pack. I also didn’t plug mine in to test as it was like the Chris Farley skit in Tommy Boy. I even ordered a size up. It took a month to arrive. Then the seller made me pay for return shipping. Total crap.
1.0,Was to tight and clingy
1.0,"I will never get this charm bracelet again!! All the charms comes off so easily! I ordered it because i thought it was a great deal, but now i see why! The charms have ALL fallen off chain. Not happy"
1.0,I ordered the toddler size 2-4. The leotard we received is about the size of a 9-month infant onesie.
1.0,"These ended up not working for me at all, and never stayed on properly."
1.0,"Very loosely strung. Already have a gap of more than 1/4"" of bare string.<br />Purchased as a gift so i didn't have an opportunity to return."
1.0,"It dose not fit because you can not pull the pin back enough to snap it in the watch face. The watch band on the right, you can see how deep the slot is to pull the pin back. The one on the left is the pretty flowered one. Notice the slot is not as deep. This stops you from pulling the pin back enough! I am also giving one star because of its beauty & packaging. I am so sad!! Loved it the minute I saw it😥. Manufacturing should have caught the bad measuring. If you could pull it back even a 32nd or 16th of an inch more it would have been perfect!?"
1.0,"So many problems I don’t even know where to begin. Cheap, papery-feeling material. Weird chemical smell. Dysfunctional drawstring. Bunching up in odd places, even without drawstring tightened. I will definitely be returning this."
1.0,this was so tiny I couldn't even get it on...it was made for a child.
1.0,Too small looks like a woman watch also very cheap
1.0,"The white isn’t even that white. It looks dirty. I wish I would’ve returned this, but missed the dead line. Go with a different company for a leather band. Very uncomfortable and not worth the money."
1.0,Hat came bended in half causing rim to fold
1.0,"This arrived in a shipping bag. No tags, not in plastic or any packaging other than the shipping bag. The smell was atrocious. Chemical and purfumy."
1.0,"It was not clear that the dial circumference is small, like a woman’s size watch. My husband has been wearing this watch for decades andI have never seen one this small!  We have to return it."
1.0,The dress is just 2 pieces of fabric sewn together.  I usually buy a large but got an XL because i wanted it to be bigger .  It would not fit my medium size sister.  It is very sheer no lining.  If I could figure out how I would send it back.  I would not purchase from this company again. It made me give a star rating but I would not even give one star.
1.0,returned it.  Way too small.  Not a large by any stretch of the imagination.
1.0,"Much too tight, especially at the biceps.  Cut the circulation off too much.  Had to cut the fabric so my husband could use them for gardening. He is an average sized man--weights 160 lbs and about 5'10&#34;. Good price (about $10.00) and fabric--just way too tight.  The price point was excellent and was hoping he could use them instead of the Coolibars.  But it back to the Coolibar brand at $25.00."
1.0,Uncomfortable and the legs roll up.
1.0,Ridiculously tight… Way too small
1.0,Poor product in every way.
1.0,"Cheap plastic print, looks like you peeled a sticker off a piece of paper and stuck it on a shirt."
1.0,"The material of this jacket is very cheap in look and feel. I have to heavily starch it to make it look like it have any kind of weight. Its very filmsy looking and thin. Very cheap polyester. Definitely not worth the price, should more be sold for $5."
1.0,I didn’t even get to wear them yet and already a pair broke. Save your money. I don’t think I’m going to wear any out because it would be embarrassing walking around with either one earring or a broken one.
1.0,It was delivered to me with a faulty zipper.  It looked like it zig zagged when open.  It was hard to zip.
1.0,Didn't  fit.
1.0,My son didn’t like it and me too because the fabric and the design are so bad.
1.0,"Looks great, but I have used this only twice and it is already broken.  Would not recommend ."
1.0,The pocket lining material is very cheap.  The inside zipper pocket had a 2 inch section that was not stitched to the zipper.  The plastic to metal rivet for the strap came off 6 days after purchase.  The top zipper closure was missing some teeth.  I purchased the red.  The color was good.
1.0,"Nice looking watch, decent material, Sad to say but very cheap internal components.<br />It only works digital display, but the hands don’t work at all. I did an online research after this issue and its seems a common problem on SKAMEI watches. Recommendation: buy two or three, keep the good one."
1.0,The worst buy. Broke on first day
1.0,Hoping the mask will shrink some to fit better and the filters are to large for the mask. You will have to fold them in half or cut to make them fit.
1.0,"It feels cheap. We’ll, it was $21. It’s not flattering at the neck. The v is too short.  I’ll keep it and wear it to bed."
1.0,"I had a detailed review posted of this winder from 2017, with photos, videos, audio, etc., but it looks like that item number was delisted and the product reposted it as a new item, perhaps to purge the negative reviews from me and others.  I unfortunately do not have the videos anymore, but do have my notes on the problems with this winder.<br /><br />The good points:  I found the Juvo winder to be exceptionally well-made, attractive and classy -- it even came with a pair of white gloves to handle your globes (a nice touch).  But the LEDs on the front also could not be turned off; there is an LED for each winder and they come on and off intermittently when the winder is spinning.  If the winder is situated in a dark room, they'll light up the room at night with a distracting dance of LEDs.  The rotary dials on the back are also poorly designed; there are eight identical-looking ones on the back, two for each of the four winders.  Four of them control the power for the respective winder, as well as other functions.  As such, there is no front-mounted power switch, unlike Wolf, Heiden, and basically every other well-designed winder.  The knobs on the back aren't vertically lined up with the winder on the front.  If you're reaching around the back to turn the knobs (four of which control the power and other functions), there's a good chance you'll be turning the wrong knob.  If you have the winder sitting against a wall, you have to reach back to turn off a winder, which is a common necessity as you're supposed to do that to avoid motor damage when installing or removing a watch.  The lack of a front-mounted power switch for each winder is inexcusable for a winder at this price point.  This was a design that clearly optimized aesthetics over functionality.<br /><br />I could have forgiven most of these defects, but the motors...  They were loud.  My previous (and purged) review actually had a video with video showing the sound from the motors.  You could hear the noises from two of them from across the room.  One of the two ""quiet"" motors started getting louder about a week into usage, suggesting poor quality.<br /><br />My overall impression, after living with the unit for close to a week, was that the Juvo was an aesthetically pleasing, and in fact beautiful, piece of industrial design.  But as an actual watch winder, it was inferior to alternatives.  I ended up returning the Juvo winder and buying a Heiden four-watch winder, which cost less than half, yet was a lot easier to use and quieter.  It's working flawlessly after about two and a half years of use."
1.0,Not what description says
1.0,"Because there is no seam to help the socks conform to your heels, they pull down at the back of the ankle & bunch-up & wrinkle on the front of the ankle.  They are not ""L"" shaped - just straight.  This lack of shaping also causes them to rotate or twist so the ""dots"" end up on one side or the other of your foot."
1.0,"Absolutely terrible. With glasses on your vision appears to have to go thru a cloud and nothing is clear. The amber is supposed to assist and give clearer vision, forget that. I am disappointed."
1.0,Hurts my ears!
1.0,Returned item. This is not a sweater. This is made out of a jersey material. Not flowing.
1.0,Arrived broken.- Got out the pliars and put it back together only to have link after link come apart.  Not even worth the low price.  In the end we went to Michaels and made our own.
1.0,No le quedó a mi garmin
1.0,The idea is good but the material does not last. I ordered one and it arrived rip. I got replacement thanks to the seller. I only used a couple of times when I walk on the treadmill and the waist trainer has  ripped in several places. I can say it does help you sweat but again the material is bad.
1.0,Fit very odd color not what I expected. Wouldn't buy again
1.0,It's cheap
1.0,"I got an XL because I have big thighs. Turns out it wasn't big enough, got them half way up my thighs and that's as far as they would go. They are extremely thin and see through. You could see all my tattoos on my legs. It would be nice it they had other sizes and was a bit thicker on the fabric but not to thick."
1.0,"Please just look at the pictures. What is the world is going on? Why put the pads in if they are going to be this cheap looking. Can I take them out? Yes, I can but then I would be at the gym with rock hard attention seeking nipples which isn't the look I am going for. I was so disappointed in this cheap bra. The material (aside from the pad) is awesome, the design is cute and the fit is true to size. If these gross pads don't bother you, go for it. If you think they look as ridiculous as I do, stay away from this bra top.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the like button :)"
1.0,Terrible design.
1.0,One clasp came broken on one of the hoops.
1.0,"It's very cheaply made, it looks like a toy watch.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The time was visible on my watch but the date was all blurred."
1.0,Bar is too short
1.0,This dress is super short!!! I’m 5’7” and it was not even mid thigh by me. The fit was terrible
1.0,Did not fit as expected.  Love how it looks on the model but in reality does not look that way on most people.  The fabric is cheap...the belt positioning is cheap and off centered with the dress.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Could only use these for a few days. Even though I cut them very accurately and they fit very snug in the beginning my active 6 year old managed to crumple them up at this toes. I tried many times to make them even out and work but it didn't work. So back to other odor eating ideas!
1.0,Update: I returned both suits and they only refunded 1. Be careful ordering from these guys if you return things!<br /><br />Top is to small but the bottoms fit well. I guess you get that with any two piece you buy. Wish they let you pick two sizes for the top and one for the bottom. I got an xl and I am a D cup. It is way to small. But over all they are cute.
1.0,"I ordered this ""jacket"" to wear outside in 50 degree weather.  It was the lightest weight, thinnest fleece I've ever seen.  I normally wear a size large but ordered a 2X and it barely fit.  Because it came from China, the cost to return it was equal to what I paid for the item.  When I complained to the manufacturer, they did offered and I did receive half my money back.  Live and learn!"
1.0,Broke on first wear.
1.0,"I am size 14 and usually get XL, which is what I did here and they are way too small. So order a size up. They are very cute thought, I wish these ones fit me."
1.0,This alleged one size fits all was skin tight on my size 4 frame. Plus the stitching was uneven and ravelling already.
1.0,"I take XL in windbreakers, sweatshirts, etc. So, I ordered XL and I couldn't even try to get it zippered, never mind put a sweatshirt under it. It fits my wife just fine, and she is much smaller than I am. The sizing is a joke and I am very disappointed. This is off far more than just allowing for 1 size up."
1.0,Not eve close to the right size
1.0,This shirt runs very small and was tight and also shorter than expected.  I ordered it in pink and the color was different than what is pictured on the site.  It looks like a bright pink in the online photo but in actuality it's more of a dim rose color.  Had to return it.
1.0,The toe area is huge and they don’t have anything on top to hold them up!
1.0,"I love the color of it and the functionality however the material was stiff and if you put anything in it, the zippers bust open!<br /> I returned it"
1.0,The product didn’t fit as it was described.  Don’t like the fabric at all
1.0,These are way too small and narrow for adults & are not Puma's. These are bootleg knock offs.
1.0,"First off, the zipper on this dress is defective. You can barely zip it up. My friend picked this dress for her all her bridesmaids and we all had to return it because some were different in the back from the others and looked nothing like the picture or because of the zipper.  The seller tried everything they could not to issue a refund.  First by refusing to send the return label. Then by offering only $50 back in the refund. Next they asked if I could pay to return it to some address in the US. And the last straw after they delayed the return, tried to tell me that I no longer qualified for a return due to the time. I would caution against using this seller. Good think Amazon customer service got involved and helped me get a full refund."
1.0,"I mean its a dollar I don't really know what I was expecting, just buy a different one. The chain broke in seconds, its way to damn shiny, the design on it is barely carved out and its overall just not a good product."
1.0,Dont buy it. I never write reviewes but i had to for this item. Very bad quality and cut. Nothing like the picture. Dont waist your money.
1.0,"Was had to use, daughter could not do it . stopped working about a week ago"
1.0,I know this is supposed to be Ric Flair but it looks like Bea Arthur.
1.0,Way to big for anyone I know to wear
1.0,"Don't like this hat, back strip to ajust hat size, sucks"
1.0,Don’t stay in place and floppy. The whole design is poor. Hardly any pink shows. May return or swap out the clip for something sturdier. My daughter isn’t happy.
1.0,"I typically don't write negative reviews, but this is warranted. The product has terrible off gassing.  I opened the package to a pungent smell and got an instant headache."
1.0,"Not cute , looks cheap"
1.0,Fell apart in less than a month.
1.0,It looks like it came out of a bubble gum machine! Embarrassing to even think of wearing this! Sent back!!
1.0,"I can't seem to engage returns or contacting the seller.  I ordered two of these, got one, and some odd cord that I didn't order.  Bad experience all around.  These are way too small anyway.  There's no way they are going to work."
1.0,Material is a knock off polyester<br />It’s to small<br />I’m not happy<br />What you see isn’t what you get<br />I bought large and wear a men’s medium shirt<br />It should fit
1.0,They look clear in picture but my pair are pink we kept them but really disappointed the descriptionwas wrong
1.0,They did not fit our glasses properly. They are too big
1.0,"I have this dress in multiple colors and I absolutely love the the comfort. However with that said, the stitching on the wine red was frayed and just overall sloppy when I received it. I know it'll have holes in it after one wash so I'm sending it back."
1.0,Clip on the back of the shoe clip was broken sent it back
1.0,"As I washed the bandanas before using them, several of them became frayed due to improper hems. They are not printed on both sides as stated. Boo! I will be returning them for refund."
1.0,"Very poor quality thin materials started to unravel at ends after washing, washing is a must during pandemic very disappointing!"
1.0,"This key chain is okay, but is definitely not a bottle opener. It broke, while I opened my second bottle. And knife is just a joke."
1.0,Too small and see through. Very upset
1.0,"This &#34;dress&#34; was nothing like the picture showed. It came to my waist in length, not down to my thighs, and the opening on the sides went down to my waist, not right under my arms. We ended up donating it as no one in my house wanted to wear it."
1.0,Material isn't comfy. Doesn't look like this picture.  I wear large tops and this was like a 2x. Super bummed
1.0,No es de mucha calidad pero no es malo
1.0,"I bought this, it was fine the first time I put it on, the second time, the eye came out. Also I kept having to flip it over because the eye kept facing backwards when I wore it."
1.0,"One of the quick release straps is defective and the strap randomly disconnects from my watch. So far I've been lucky in that my watch itself hasn't fallen and been broken, however, as you can imagine, this issue renders the product unusable."
1.0,Broke within a few months - bought another one and it broke even faster.  Cheaply made!
1.0,It was not true to size .and the quality  was not good it shrank  when I washed it and I washed it in cold water.
1.0,Awful quality. We bought two different styles and they were both awful.
1.0,"Some of these fit my vest buttons, most do not. They will pop off. Returns are a pain as well. I do not recommend."
1.0,"Very nice looking and appears to be made of quality materials.  HOWEVER, the latch used to open ring and then secure them not only pushes in to add or take away keys.......it also opens OUT and if you aren't looking (and who constantly looks at their key chain.  I have had a key pop off in my pocket (not a big problem if you catch it.....but as happened yesterday, if an important key pops out (as did my home entrance key did yesterday) you might find yourself screwed.  I found another missing this morning.  I will be ditching this key chain, it is not worth the effort to return for a small credit.  Sorry guys, I have tried, but I learned my lesson yesterday...."
1.0,"I ordered this cover-up for my granddaughter for our annual girls' trip.  I ended up needed to purchase another one while we were traveling.  This cover-up is very sheer, as you expect chiffon to be, however, it had already come apart at a couple of the seams when we opened it.  Very disappointing. The pullover styling and the colors are great but we had to throw it away and replace it.  I was able to get a refund of my purchase."
1.0,It was packaged  and sold as 200 pieces but there were only 83 flat round and 35 tubular cord locks. I was shorted 82 cord locks. I don’t usually count things like this but it was so noticeable that I felt I couldn’t just let it slide. I had started to remove the label but stopped to count. What a scam.
1.0,These glasses were for little girls on your web site it said adults
1.0,Not a true fit  poor quality
1.0,Very cheap and shiny.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, very low quality, definitely not ""slip-on"""
1.0,NOT GOOD AT ALL. WAY TO SMALL.
1.0,Looks so much better in photos. The words are very hard to see and the stones look cheap. Overall disappointed with it. Returning for refund.
1.0,"I can't get these on.  The wire goes into a teeny tiny little hole and no matter how long I work at it I cannot get the wire to go into the hole.  I don't have someone living with me to help me get these on.  Frankly, it's ridiculous and in spite of the low price I'm not happy."
1.0,"I was not happy with my order. It says this is an adult apron, but it was in no way adult. My two year old could wear it. Amazon was great in sending me a new one the next day, but it was the same, so they have given me a refund."
1.0,"The screw is easily stripped and the end is flat. So your best bet is to jam an Allen wrench on the back end and try your best. It works the first time, but after that, you've wasted your money... I am not the type of person who just complains on Amazon, this is a special case. I highly recommend NOT buying this belt. If you have to switch from black to brown with any regularity, you'll get four months out of it, max."
1.0,These aren't steel. I got a nasty infection. Steel doesn't do that to me.
1.0,Lens popped out and frame broke almost immediately.  Useless.
1.0,"Very, very disappointed! Flimsy thin material that barely resembled flannel that literally tore at the leg seam after one night of wearing by my 11 year old daughter. Worst purchase through Amazon ever."
1.0,woah cheap. and seriously dark tint. photograph should better reflect tint of the lenses.
1.0,YEPAL very nice style  in horrible quality
1.0,Magnet for money clip is two week to hold more than two bills down and I would trust it to stay with a buck in it. Narrow card slots. Cheap material. Got a similar higher quality wallet at Wilson's leather for same price.
1.0,"I ordered the digital, desert camo, USMC ballcap as depicted in the picture. I received a flag. Returning..."
1.0,I loved this earrings but could only wear them 2x so sad because they are gorgeous 😞
1.0,Im tired of seeing products for girls cost more than the exact same product for boys. Don’t offer pink gloves if you can’t be equitable. It shouldn’t cost more to be female.
1.0,do not like them. They rub together. very uncomfortable and slide around in my shoes..
1.0,"It fit but after throwing it into the washer, the strings started to come undone. I'm really disappointed. I will have to find time to stitch it back myself, I'm still very disapointed."
1.0,I’ve hardly worn this and I really thought it was kool.  I put it on just recently and it snapped in half. I expected it to last forever since it t cost me $50.00. In actuality it is only worth $5.00. That was a lot of money for junk! Very disappointed would hope it would be replaced.
1.0,"Baggy, makes me look huge"
1.0,This product appears to be sweatshirt material but when received it is cheap shiny polyester material. Picture cute. Produce cheap looking.
1.0,"Stylish, comfortable, shirt ripped on bottom left from getting caught on side of chair like it was paper."
1.0,"I could've gone to Claire's at the mall and bought this for $12. Looks beautiful, but so do some of the fake and CHEAP items at stores like Claire's. Save your money and take a trip to the mall."
1.0,For it to be a woman size make sure you guys check the chart I did that but these definitely run smaller than the other items I may have bought off of Amazon this size chart was specifically made for smaller women even though the size chart that is given gives you the size for size 16 but I'm guessing it was made for juniors they clearly need to state that this is for smaller women for future references and purchases
1.0,"These fog up and condensation builds up on the inside. Also, IT IS SO HOT! I had to switch to a face shield instead. Do yourself a favor and just go straight for the shield rather than wasting $15 on these."
1.0,Super thin and cheap do not buy these !
1.0,CRAP! DO NOT BUY! Glasses don't fit correctly & constantly falls off my face which makes no sense cuz I've bought these same glasses before just w/out the case & those fit perfectly. Case is super cool but glasses are crap!
1.0,"Attractive, roomy handbag, but NOT 100% Genuine Leather.  Based on the seller's description, I was rather excitedly thought I had found an attractive GENUINE LEATHER handbag on Amazon at an incredible price. I ordered it immediately.<br />It arrived in the usual Amazon box. The first unusual thing was the the lack of packing for the bag. Nothing to insure it arrived without scratches to its surface--just the handbag tucked inside a clear plastic bag. No wrapped handles, no tags, nothing attached stating country of origin, nor materials. The lack of attention to details like this is quite unlike any other leather bags I have purchased in the past (either through Amazon or fulfilled directly by Amazon). Usually, the supplier/manufacturer goes to great care their product will arrive unmarred.<br /><br />While unpacking it, I was expecting the wonderful aroma of tanned leather to waft from the package. Instead, I got hit full nose on with the odor of plastic/vinyl. Hoping it was the lining which gave off the smell, I lifted it to my nose and inhaled. No leather smell, but more importantly, no leather feel. If you've owned quite a few leather goods, you'll understand what I mean when I say that both the feel and the temperature of the handbag was wrong. Most importantly, the fine grain was entirely too perfectly repetitive. Much too perfect.<br /><br />Upon closer inspection, I realized the entire bag was comprised of several layers of materials apparently bonded together in some fashion.  If there is any true leather in the construction of the handbag then it's some form of reconstituted/pressed franken-leather, a.k.a, BONDED leather.  From the SaddlbackLeather.com website: &#34;Bonded leather is the dust and shavings of the leather glued and pressed together. Leftover scraps are ground together with glue and resurfaced in a process similar to vinyl manufacture. Bonded leather is weak and degrades quickly with use.&#34;<br />Should a bonded leather product ethically be termed GENUINE LEATHER?<br />Given the limited description of the bag stating it was genuine leather, I expected a bag made with either full grain or top grain leather. This handbag is disappointingly neither. It is in the process of being returned.<br /><br />I usually do my groundwork prior to purchasing items such as shoes and purses, etc.  I guess I felt a false sense of security with the offer of an additional discount provided by the seller in return for my product critique.  The handbag's description truly needs to include the words &#34;bonded leather&#34; or something similar.  I am certain purchasers have made and will continue to make the same mistake I did in assuming the product description was completely accurate.<br />Overall, in spite of the questionable materials, it is nicely made with one large interior zippered pocket as well handy open pockets for a cell phone or sunglasses. It also came with an additional adjustable strap of which I've included a close up photo. It was the easiest way to show the handbag's multi-layer construction.<br />I'm disappointed it didn't live up to my expectations of solid leather, and I'm disappointed in myself for not applying due diligence.  Some things are really too good to be true."
1.0,Way too small doesn't even go passed my waist. Could be used more as a nursing cover.
1.0,"Have to say, I'm very disappointed in the quality. I wore them for less than 3 hours, took them out to shower and when I set them on the counter the ball popped out of the bead making them basically useless. Definitely wouldn't recommend buying these."
1.0,We’re to small but they are silver
1.0,Cute..too bad i cant ware it👿
1.0,"The size chart said 16-18, i wear a 14 and the 16-18 was really tiny .."
1.0,Nothing most about the pants I brought for my son n law for Christmas and the next couple of weeks they were in shredds I'm pissed off that I paid my money for garbage because that's actually where there had to go!!!!
1.0,"Super cheap and plastic. Would go with something silicone if you want it on a cheaper watch, but definitely doesn't look good at all on something dressy."
1.0,All the paint chipped off within an hour the whole reason for buying them.
1.0,Can see boobs through extra large arm holes. Fabric and dress is cheaply made. Zipper sticks. Not worth the money.
1.0,Knock-off that doesn’t even come in a package and does not fit the saddle!
1.0,"The shirt looks great, but runs a little small."
1.0,My little todder with small hands were able to squeeze her hand through. Some of the holes for fingers were literally non existent.
1.0,"Should have read the reviews before buying.  Sizes are not American, cheap sticker stars that won't survive a wash.  WAY Too SMALL!"
1.0,Top of the leggings are misprinted so the buckle doesn’t line up. Large white stripe across butt. I’ve ordered an exact replacement as they are soft and fit great. I’m a curvy 5’2 150 pounds with a booty and size Large was perfect.
1.0,"I followed the size chart and it is way too big. It took forever to get here, cheap material. Kept it only because return window expired."
1.0,The gold color of this bracelet was off. It looks fake.  It doesn’t pair well with my other watches which is how I planned to wear it.
1.0,"This purse is so cute, too bad that I struck out twice. For the price I didn't expect 5 star craftsmanship but this wasn't even close! The clasp broke on the first one when I went to attach it right out of the package.  I liked it so much I returned it and ordered a second one. One of the  clasps broke again about an hour into using it. If u have an extra strap at home, maybe u can take a chance.  I'm done."
1.0,"The picture here makes it look nice, but it is God awful ugly and cheap looking. These items come out of China and I am so disappointed in the poor quality they are made from. The colors are hideous. Don't waste your hard earned cash!"
1.0,"I ordered an xl. I’m 5’8, 250lbs, and I’m an hour glass shape. It fit great in my chest (38DDD) but once it got past my hips it was a no. It was much to short. It hit mid calf. It all around just was not very flattering. If it were longer I may have attempted to put it on with shape wear to smooth out the curves. I gave it to my roommate who is 5’5 and all around a size medium. It looks more her size. If it doesn’t fit her, I’ll return it.<br />Update: it looks amazing on her so basically not true to size. Xl fits like a medium."
1.0,"This dress did not fit at all. Who every  created needs to stop,"
1.0,Very cheap looking. I do not recommend it at all.
1.0,There is no bunching like the picture shows and the back part looks completely different. I ordered an XL and had to give it to my mom who typically wears a small because its that small. She wears it backwards because it looks better that way. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. The material is really cheap and wont last long.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4869603d8e966446581c9a1d15de8264]]
1.0,"At least 2/6 pairs arrived broken, with the bead detached from the earring"
1.0,This necklace was too small for what it cost. It looks bigger on the app
1.0,This product does not look original
1.0,This shirt would be great for someone who is 350lbs and 7' tall. My fiancé is 290lbs and 6'2&#34; and the 3XL Tall looked more like a dress on him. The design is okay but the colors are mediocre and already fading.
1.0,Gave it one star because I can't give zero stars. Cut two fingers on the band buckle which ended up needing a screwdriver as well as pliers to push the buttons to open. Didn't work at all when it arrived and after a day in a winding box it ran until I took it out and it stopped. This watch is a POS and I threw mine into my scrap metal bin.
1.0,"Didn't match the ad,image very blurry will not buy again"
1.0,The description is vague. I thought I was buying a set of headbands. I received one. You can't pick the color either. This item was actually cheaper at my local walmart...
1.0,Dress day oddly and was way too big. I am returning this product. I was not impressed.
1.0,This dress is cheap looks nothing like the picture its runs big and i returned it and they gave me a hard time because i needed have a tracking number. Dont waste your money
1.0,Ordered a large because that’s my size. Was too tight.  so I ordered an extra large and the extra large was smaller than the large. Junk
1.0,Arrived scuffed.... Didn't even try the shoes on. Will be returning.
1.0,Haven’t gotten to wear it yet and it has a hole in it. Super bummed.
1.0,"I had to punch one more hole for it to fit me, worked fine literally for one day then it stopped staying in the hole. Whatever holds it in place broke off that easily and now It just pops out of any hole as if it’s too tight. Absolute waste of money. If I didn’t have to drill that hole I would’ve returned and asked for my money back."
1.0,Not true to size. Basically super short and wide. Really thin and wrinkly.
1.0,The inside pocket has a hole already. Thought I lost my work keys and lip gloss but they just fell down into the bottom of the bag.
1.0,Shrank by two sizes after washing.
1.0,No chain?? Bought for a Christmas present and it doesn't have the chain
1.0,"Although the numbers and the name are stitched on to the jersey, the stripes on the shoulders REALLY cheapen the jersey.  They are a rubbery, tape like feel, that seems to be ironed onto the jersey.  The jersey also runs a size smaller.  A medium on me, fits very comfortably.  There is no way that I am a large.  No way is this worth $120.00.  I sent it back immediately for a refund.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"HUGE disappointment.  The zipper broke the 2nd day that I used it. I should have taken the time and effort to return it, I had already burned box and paperwork in fireplace.  VERY CHEAPLY MADE.  The purse is cute and just the right size, but unfortunately, without a zipper that works, the purse is useless.  Would NOT Recommend this product."
1.0,"We loved the design,  but the blue color is not accurate.  We were very disappointed!"
1.0,I ordered a size up because I like the long look.  It isn't long at all.
1.0,The strong kept getting loose and the metal grommet would always slip to the bottom. Would not stay in my wrist.
1.0,Not what i expected. Very thin and overpriced. They should be like $10 for the way they're. I'll use them as pajamas i guess.
1.0,Sent back. The doesn't stay in place.
1.0,I bought this because it was a wind up pocket watch. The crystal is plastic and the stem wind up broke after a  short time of using it. The orientation is right - size is right but seems to be a little fragile and I don't know how long the plastic crystal will last
1.0,Very ugly.. probably wont wear
1.0,Truly wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. This is no dress. It's a top at best and measures smaller tham advertised. Cute design.
1.0,"2 months in and it broke. I do wear this everyday. I love the look. I do not shower in it, wear it while I'm in the pool or anything like that. And the straps fell out of the clasp"
1.0,Terrible quality. Broke the first time I wore them.
1.0,"The zipper on this coat is the worst zipper on Earth making the coat useless.  The coat itself is fine.  Fits as expected, true to size.  Color is great.  Arm length is perfect.  Covers the butt as expected.  But, the zipper chosen for this coat is completely worthless.  When I tried to return due to a zipper that will not work I was refused return authorization.  I called Amazon and they forced it.  I got my money back, but only because Amazon got involved and I have Amazon Prime.  Don't bother.  The coat won't work and customer service will try to block your return."
1.0,Weird material.  Buttonholes were sealed!  Waaaay too small.
1.0,Way to small I'm returning
1.0,It’s a fall coat not a winter coat 😡
1.0,"I can 't seem to find anything I can wear these under. They show under everything, even under jeans."
1.0,"The stone came in pieces and the stone was out of the ring.It looks so nice , very disappointed.  What should I do ?"
1.0,"I had read the reviews of these glasses which prompted me to make the purchase.  The product seems to be of decent quality and the price very fair.  They arrived in short order.  However, I am disappointed by the effectiveness of these glasses for nighttime driving.  For me, they do not improve visibility at night at all.  In fact, I would say that I can see better without them than I can see with them.  They claim to reduce glare from headlights and to illuminate things at night making it easier to see while driving.  Well I am sorry to say that they don't do that for me.  The seller is good but the product does not live up to its billing. I would not recommend these glasses for nighttime driving."
1.0,"I am actually very disappointed. This item appears to be great material and looks really nice. However, size is not what you would expect. I ordered a large.Ex-Large and when I tried it on, it felt and looks like I am wearing a small/extra, extra small. Very disappointing....."
1.0,"I love all of the other colors, except this one.  I have 5 of these and they are great.  Apricot color is completely see through. The tunics are soft and comfy,  very loose and flowy. I gave the apricot away and felt half bad doing it."
1.0,Love this but it didn’t come with the attached belt.  I guess I’ll have to return and reorder
1.0,I had the Polo down vest from Ralph Lauren and decided just to replace Polo vest.
1.0,Not made correctly.  Wrap didn't have enough fabric.  The dress should wrap around to the farther side however it just gathers.  Not a good design in my opinion. Fabric was scratchy.
1.0,I got an extra large that does not fit me. It is a tight fit. I recommend one size bigger.
1.0,"After reading countless positive reviews here, I decided to buy this umbrella. I used it for the first time yesterday and three steps from my home and it turned inside out. By the time I got to the train, I was pretty wet. Wouldn’t recommend this product."
1.0,Don’t waste your money.  The don’t fit as expected they run so so small.  I bought a 3x because I like them use and they fit like a med
1.0,"I purchased the kitty face night dress the website description clearly states 95% Rayon 5% Spandex after washing in a garnet bag and looking at the tag for drying  instructions it states 95% Polyester, I am not a fan of polyester as I find it very hot! this is very upsetting as I am now stuck with it! False advertising at its finest!"
1.0,sizing off
1.0,Too small and not pretty as in the picture. I returned them.
1.0,This is the second pair ive recieved. They are actually a replacement pair because the first pair was scratched. And these were in fact scratched as well. No more replacements just want a refund no.
1.0,"Lousy, had to buy different ones."
1.0,The A came off of the holder.
1.0,i returned it...
1.0,"Me encanta el material, se siente muy suave!!! Pero lamentablemente vino manchado!!!! Muy decepcionada. Por eso pongo una estrella."
1.0,"Ordered largest size possible, very small, can’t get it on my 5,7” 250 pound frame. Fabric is a light terracotta color and scratchy. Do not recommend item for anyone larger than a size Medium"
1.0,No tiene la lengüeta antipolvo suela muy delgada y ruidosa en la altura del talón al camiar para el precio calzado malo no recomendable
1.0,They were a weird material. Much smaller than USA size. Not worth the money.
1.0,I bought it based on the picture - which made it look larger than it was.  The bracelet part of the band was very short - it did not even go 1/2 way around my wrist and the chain part was not sturdy enough that I felt comfortable having my watch on it. A total waste of money
1.0,The glasses are cool but the pair I received were already broken. The handle’s screw was loose cause them to sit lopsided on my daughter.
1.0,Not great! I bought it for a friend and in 1 day it broke in half! The size was right and if it didn't break then this ring could have been perfect. Wouldnt recommend!
1.0,"Size runs very small, I ordered a 3x (I am an XL) but fits like a medium would"
1.0,"Update; May 2019. My fiance loved these sunglasses until they broke today!!!. She has seriously only wore them a total of 15 times. They are always kept in case or in the built in visor case inside her truck. She went to put them on today and black plastic fell off of them near the silver metal piece on left side of frame.....the plastic that fell off was surrounding the two tiny screws that hold the side ear piece to the frame. Upon inspection it appears both sides are doing the same. Rendering the glasses broken and unable to be worn. I paid too much money for these for her to only be able to get approx 15 wears out of them since late Nov. 2018 when i got them for her. Due to this the the stars get knocked down to 1 star. These are obviously not the quality we thought they were.<br /><br />Very nice sunglasses. Bought these for my fiancee and she loves them. They look good and block the sun very well. The quality seems nice. They came with a hard case, soft case and a very nice cleaning cloth. I would buy again."
1.0,Very disappointed with these earrings. Looks colorful in picture but can hardly see any color on the actual earrings. Also received with the posts bend flat against the earrings.
1.0,I bought these for a cooler compression sock to wear this Summer.  The color is very yellow not a true beige. They won't go with anything. They aren't really stretchy enough to be good compression and the ribbing is uncomfortable.  These are Going  back.
1.0,"The  ""Dubly - double DD"" logo is slightly fuzzy instead of crisp of outline. The blue color faded on the first  laundry washing [in COLD water - all other laundry came out perfectly fine in the same washing] causing the shirt to appear almost tie-dyed.<br /><br />I've purcahsed other ""cheap"" shirts from Amazon and have not had this issue on any of them.<br /><br />Very unfortunate, especially at $19/shirt.<br /><br />This is really just a rip-off."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture,disappointed and it fits big.Its actually a Leggings made from spandex type material.size chart misleading,wish I didn't buy"
1.0,"This is the second dress I’ve purchased. Both dresses received  were not the dress pictured. Both were thick, true to size with thicker straps and a higher vneck. Not near as fashionable as the dress pictured in the stock photo. I feel the dresses purchased years ago were more like the photo according to reviews. Overpriced and false description. Very disappointed."
1.0,"It's extremely small. It'd work for a child, but not an adult. The snout is also creased in a way where it's just permanently damaged. This is important because the snout is also where the eye holes you look through are. I'm really disappointed in this item. They also don't offer returns. Please buy a better one elsewhere."
1.0,"I ordered extra large and this is like XXX large , The sleeves are about 8 to 12 inches too long so I just roll them up but it's nice and warm  and I like the pockets .I just didn't know how to send it back to get a smaller one or if that extra large was the size that it came in."
1.0,"I returned this costume because the fabric was not breathable and felt heavy.  The fit, overall, was too big--but the head opening was too small.  The hood also looked ridiculous and had to be held back to keep it from covering my eyes."
1.0,"I do not like this watch as the face is quite small and not readable for me.  This was not clear in the listing.  Further, it costs more to send it back than I paid for it."
1.0,Very thin! So thin that you can see your underwear through them. Definitely not wearing these to work out
1.0,Zero stars. This necklace fell apart within an hour if wearing it. Suuuuper cheap.
1.0,Horrible material. The tree arrived falling apart and my son could only use once.
1.0,2 sizes too big!!!
1.0,"So hard to click and when I did, the pincher would not be tight enough to hold them closed, They are even tarnishing now...not sure if this really is silver!!! DO NOT BUY"
1.0,It looks nice the first few days and then turns black. Also it's impossible to get it unscrewed. Wouldn't recommend it. A waste of money
1.0,Misleading photo. This ring was a gold/bronze color. Not shiny silver at all.  I returned it.
1.0,"When I received the shirt, it was absolutely adorable! I wore it one time. Washed it in cold water then popped it into the dryer on low heat. While it went into the wash an XL, it came back out a size small! No joke! I laid it on top of one of my daughters size small T-shirts and that’s how much it shrink"
1.0,"I am SO, so disappointed.  I was really escited when I got eearlierk and immeditely tried them on.  The description says their is elastic around the bottom of the legs. There is, butt he leg holes are SO big I could fit both of mine into one. They're long too.  The res of the leg portion fits normally, then it's tight, most definitely like a size XS instead of a S.  The top, is long like a small should be, yet the rest of the shirt is as small as an XS.  It isn't comfortable due to this at all.  Although even if sized right Idk if would still be comfortable or not, because it's like a hard material. It isn't soft at all.  Like I said, I'm really disappointed. I cn't recommend this item at all.  Sorry!"
1.0,"Returned, there is not enough eye space. You have to move your head from side to side a lot to see clearly."
1.0,This barely fit on me or my little sister.
1.0,Looks fake. Very cheaply made.
1.0,These glasses are not anti fog. My son wore these glasses on top of his prescription glasses and he was very uncomfortable.
1.0,"The bracelet I received looks FAR worse than the photo in the Amazon listing. I deemed it worthless--not wearable even if it were $5. Beyond cheap-looking.  I invite you to look at a number of reviews of products sold by this seller before making your purchase. Of course, some are positive, and those may be legitimate reviews or reviews by friends of the seller, I cannot say. But I am not the only one who was shocked at the enormous disparity between the photo of the jewelry and the actual item received."
1.0,They broke after a short time.  The piece between the toes frayed
1.0,I was very disappointed in the quality of the hat.  The artwork was ironed on instead of embroidered and the brim of the hat was severely bent in shipping because the hat was shipped in a bag instead of a box.
1.0,I ordered a 3t size.  That is not what I got!  It looked like a size 12 months!  This was WAY too small!
1.0,The tie around part makes it difficult and uncomfortable for child. Would like to return but window closed.
1.0,"This dress isn’t just disgusting it came nasty with DEODORANT MARKS on it and it’s wayyyy too short the fit is good but it is a horrible length. Very disappointed, probably my worst order from amazon ever"
1.0,Couldn’t even get it over my shoulders .. To small
1.0,These are not true to size. They fit at least two sizes too small. Xxxl fit medium-large only.
1.0,"Firstly, this costume is very cheaply made. The faux velvet is so thin it is see through. Also, the printing on the ghost parts is so heavy that those parts feel like plastic.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the hood and cowl are a separate piece and not attached to the dress.<br /><br />Another problem is the fit. I'm a bigger, pretty busty gal and there is no way this would fit me especially in the bust. If you are busty, you'll definitely want to go up a size or two."
1.0,If you have any boobs what’s so ever don’t bother . Don’t know how the rest fits because I couldn’t get it over my chest. I ordered a large to be safe and I almost suffocated trying to remove it . I’m only a b cup & a medium sized woman .
1.0,Very cheap fabric I don’t recommend that you buy it at all
1.0,I literally took an earring out the packets and the whole back with the stick fell off the earrings. I had bought them to wear matching earrings with my two daughters. What a bummer.
1.0,It was surprise to be a royal blue sparkly mask I got a darker blue with white dots I don’t know what part is sparkly . So I paid almost 80 for mask that are just plain cotton mask and they where for my daughters wedding this Saturday so semi tie dye will not work
1.0,"Beautiful dress and fits body perfect frown bust down. However I am a 34B bra size and the way the sides are cut show almost my entire side boob. It would work fine if I didn’t have my arms up or out but if I did a nip slip would definitely happen.<br /><br />Tried to return this, since they are located in China they didn’t want to return it since it would cost more and said they could give a 25% refund..... what?!?!! I’m never going to wear it and it is not my fault that the dress is cut poorly."
1.0,Purse handles broke with in a couple of months...not worth what you pay for it...save your money.
1.0,Air Vent fell off within a hour of wearing it
1.0,"This is so gorgeous, but it arrived in pieces.  This is made of some super flimsy stuff.  I was beyond disappointed as I really wanted to wear it with a special dress."
1.0,I received a faulty one! I can tell I received a bracelet that someone else returned and it didn't go through the process of looking new again. My bracelet had weird black marks all over it showing its been heavily worn. Also it looks really cheap! Nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Buttons fell off after first washing, and didn't return to its original shape."
1.0,Grandma style
1.0,"Cheap crap, dont bother"
1.0,"Ordered a M when I normally wear a S and it was STILL too small.  It was seriously like child sized.  XXS, short, tight, and thin material.  In the picture it looks as though it would sit at your natural waist-not the case. It is like a low-rise skirt."
1.0,The band broke after a week and it won't keep the correct time.
1.0,Didn't come with buckle
1.0,"Awful material, I just could wear it one day, it lost the color."
1.0,The sizes are smaller than what they say. I had to send it back.
1.0,Sanitized and it turned.
1.0,"Changing my review. The colors are vibrant, better than the pictures. After two weeks the color is starting to come off on the edges of the band, exposing the white band. I have not worn worn it in the shower or doing dishes and the color is still coming off."
1.0,I didn’t even try them on my son. The quality is very poor. Cheaply made.
1.0,Broke first time Grandson played with it flimsy. Returned for new one it did the same this time however Grandson went back home to NYC so couldn’t return it. Took a loss
1.0,I am embarrassed to give them as I planned for gifts. They look really cheap
1.0,"I really liked these shirt stays the first 7 times of wearing, but today one of the buckles came apart and is not able to be put back together. Super disappointed after reading the great reviews about how these last a long time, and hoping the seller will work with us for a replacement pair."
1.0,It runs small.  The material feels plastic.  Not a nice material.
1.0,"Color is beautiful, but it doesn’t fit right at all! It’s way too short!"
1.0,"I wish I had read the reviews that said they don't come with those lil rubber backs. Lost one the first time worn, just like other reviews. They are great looking earrings but crazy to not come with backs!!!!"
1.0,Definitely not true to size had to return 3X was more like a medium
1.0,"Too large, ordered size S but it fits  like size XL"
1.0,This belt doesn't stay in place and the Velcro doesn't stay closed
1.0,Oversized is an understatement; plus wrong color was sent.
1.0,"Very dark looking, not bright colored or shiny. The 1 star earring is bent and has a bent ear post. Would not recommend.  Very tiny rhinestones."
1.0,"This is undersized, probably above an xl you need to go up 2 sizes. I bought 1 size up and it does not fit."
1.0,Pearls Pearls Pearls!! Everywhere right out of the box. On my floor on my counter. Had to sweep for a while and run the vacuum for a bit to make sure my crawling baby didn’t find one and swallow a darn pearl. What a mess!  Wish I would have done a video to post the disaster but my baby was much more important.
1.0,"I'm almost always satisfied with everything I order from Amazon don't do many reviews but this was a have too, I am so unhappy with this item this was pure junk as soon as I tried to screw the ball off and screw back on it wouldn't get tight shipping cost more than the stud will never order piercing jewelry from here again!"
1.0,"Rock hard insides. I have worn helmets for 40+ years, this thing was more uncomfortable than an early 70's helmet. Looked good, wanted orange, but after 5 seconds it went back in the box and I ordered a more expensive unit."
1.0,"This was waaaay bigger than it appeared in the photo. Large enough to use as a door knocker. DO NOT run while wearing it, as having something this large thump against your chest may cause severe chest bruising. I returned it for a refund."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e22c04dd0ed9143bd69b08f80524e6bf]]
1.0,Too big-had to return
1.0,"Cheap material, it fits too high above my chest. Became cleaning rugs after wearing it one time."
1.0,These very pretty but and that’s a big BUT they are so wide it’s like BIG foot tried to cram his foot in them!! Don’t buy!
1.0,Not sized for American women!  Very cheap material.
1.0,"They wouldn’t work on my phone, like they were supposed to."
1.0,"This product is very comfortable, warm and exactly what I wanted, It’s hard giving this item a 1star. But it’s also heartbreaking when you only had it for 5 days and your walking to your home office at 6:30am in the morning and poof the strap unravel. I’m not going to waste my time with this product, I will be returning for a full refund."
1.0,Not true to size. Ordered an XL because that is my size and its too small in all ways.
1.0,Very cheaply made. You can fit credit cards OR a phone NOT both! Very disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered these shirts for a 12 year old boy. The shorts were a little bit larger than expected after ordering the “appropriate size”. The zipper on the back pocket was broke when it arrived. The hem around the waist band started to fray and unravel after 3 hours of wearing, and the back side of the shorts had snags in the fabric. The inside pocket for holding a phone for running or exercising was the reason for even buying these shorts and that worked functional but with all the other issues I would not buy again and the reason for only 1 star. Made very cheaply but did arrive very quick"
1.0,Fail socks
1.0,"Pulled out of package, put it on and this was already there."
1.0,No clue how to change the lenses out and the top of frame is too tall. It hits my helmet causing my none bridge to be quite sore.
1.0,Not worth the money. This item arrived late and looks nothing like the picture. It's a poorly made printed sweater.
1.0,"I ordered this back in the Spring.  I was so excited for it to arrive. I tried it on, it fitted perfectly.  Not the highest quality but kinda what I expected for the price.  I went to wear it for the first time yesterday 6/30, tied the back for it to snap completely apart.  I didn't even  leave my bedroom for it to break.  Never even wore it. Not once!  Extremely frustrated & will not buy again.  So, save your money to buy a high quality suit."
1.0,"This eye patch broke as soon as it was put on, very disappointed"
1.0,"I'm normally a large, but due to the other reviews, I ordered up to a XXL.  It was about the size of a medium.  This will definitely be going back."
1.0,The shirt does not look like the photo.  The flowers are pink but the sleeves are a salmon orange color.  Who wants that?  Cannot believe they sent a product like this.
1.0,"Crappy quality, super cheap look, does not look like the picture. Contacted seller, wanted to return item, never heard back from seller. Will not order from this seller again."
1.0,Was very disappointed YHVH was removed. Joel 2:32 says we should call upon YHVH.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f21689bf50b047d42ea1e6814639d4ed]] Came broken in two pieces. The links are a lot bigger than I expected. Will be returning. Don't feel like fighting with it to connect the pieces
1.0,$10 Strap looks like it was dragged across pavement for 200 yards and now I’m expected to go out of my way to make the the return…not right
1.0,It doesn't stay on my side car window
1.0,These were the right size. They were even too small for my son that wears size 10! Junk!!

1.0,Did not care for the fabric and way big
1.0,"Cheap product, didn’t even work when I got it"
1.0,"Very Small on the top with a very cheap looking fabric. it was so bad that I wore it once and knew it should be returned. Btw, I also lost little money on the return!!!!!"
1.0,"I am not sure what the other reviewers were talking about with how well these work.  I was hoping they would help me sleep with my husband's snoring, but they are the worst at sound blocking that I have purchased to date - perhaps that's why I couldn't find their Noise Rating before buying them (I gave up and bought them anyways based on the reviews and because I was in a hurry).  Now, I keep getting emails from the seller or their representative (Olivia Lewis) asking how I liked them and sending marketing material, in spite of me replying to one of the emails to say how much I was unsatisfied.  If you aren't concerned about blocking noise, and you don't care about getting spammed by the seller (I don't think I've ever had that happen with any other Amazon purchase I've made - super annoying), then buy these.  By the way... the best earplugs I've found are ultra soft foam ones... they truly are the most comfortable and block the most noise... if you do an internet search for best earplugs, I'm sure you'll figure out which they are - good luck in your quest!"
1.0,This product is way too thin this is supposed to be a warm hoodie it was not what I was expecting I'm very disappointed. I will add that the print was at least clear.

1.0,Size is way too small.
1.0,Very disappointed.<br /><br />Piece of junk. I and one other were unable to change the digital hour format from 24 to 12.<br /><br />The back light is almost non-existent.<br /><br />It’s a beautiful watch with an easy to read analog dial. Yellow hands on a black face. If this is all you need; fine.<br /><br />But if you are looking for any backlit help at all (and digital functionality) forget about it. Keep you money and buy a better watch.<br /><br />I have returned it and am awaiting for a refund.
1.0,Bad quality.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,You can see straight through this! It is also more fitted than the pic shows so a slip would be tricky.<br />TOTALLY see through. I cannot state this strongly enough.<br />Super disappointed.

1.0,Es de muy mala calidad
1.0,Way too small. Gave to my daughter that wears a medium.

1.0,"I wish I could  have love these but with a small wrist, the strap was way too long that it would have bothered me. Had to return them."
1.0,Too small for a size fits all.  I wear an 8 and it was tight on me.  It was also poor quality.

1.0,"The fabric of these pants are the worst possible.  After one wear (asleep, in bed), the fabric began to rip away at the seams.  After two complete restitchings along ALL seams the fabric continues to tear so I now have $14 rags."
1.0,"Dot constantly flips on its side, making necklace look weird."

1.0,"When the glasses arrived, a lens was cracked.  I did try them on, though, and they are extremely poor quality and fall right off my face.  I would even consider myself as having a big head.  These are cheaply made as evidenced by the broken lenses.  Stay away from these"
1.0,Material is not pleasing
1.0,"Picture makes it look long in the back, which is exactly what i wanted. Its definitely NOT what i got. Its very short and runs small. Im 5'5&#34; 38DDD.  It barley fits past my belt loop on my booty, in jeans. Also took a month to get here. Will not purchase again!!"
1.0,Lost the gold  coloring in 4 days
1.0,"I wear a 2XL and from previous experience with certain Amazon clothing being too small, ordered a 3XL. These shorts are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. I could not even put them on. They are ridiculously small. The 3XL I received was more like a size Medium. Ridiculously small. Its a shame, too, as they appear to be a pretty good pair of shorts, in both material and craftsmanship,  except for being ridiculously small."
1.0,"was way too small for my husband, will find someone to give it to. Anything ordered from China be it dog or human clothing runs super small....learned an expensive lesson."

1.0,Not an good fit.. way small

1.0,"I ordered an XS, the pants looked like they would have fit, however the shirt was enormous. It easily looked like it was a 2X or 3X.  I understand the shirt was supposed to be loose fitting, but I literally think 2 of me would have fit in. I returned the product."

1.0,No where close to the correct sizing.
1.0,Ordered the normal size for my son and it was two sizes too small
1.0,Size runs 1 size smaller than tshirts. Gotta order another cause I don't like my shirts tight.
1.0,My son got to wear this shirt one time. After washing on gentle cold wash not only did it shrink but it creates fuzz balls all over the shirt.
1.0,Way too small. Didn't look like a good purchase at all. I'm going to stick to getting clothes in person from now on.
1.0,"This pair of gauges broke within 2 wears. I did not tighten them too hard considering the material, yet they broke right on my ear."
1.0,These shoes are HORRIBLE. They are extremely wide and they come off my feet every time I walk. I would not purchase again.
1.0,Looks better in the photo than in person
1.0,This item was  made with very cheap material broke in 4 weeks  poor  quality . I used to have the same shape  keyring 10 years ago well made & stronger never broke or damage unfortunately  This is so light  cheap keyring  from China  .
1.0,"Very thin, material not what expected didn’t even meet in the middle returned same day"
1.0,very thin had hole in it at the seam
1.0,Buy 2 or 3 size above. This is a fancy night gown.<br />You'll need another pants to go under as undergarment. It's  not recommend with another pants under. It's very see-through like georgette material with cheesy sequence I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT.  Unless you work at topless bar or nude bar. Cause this as close to nude
1.0,"I didn't like it. my mom kinda did, but I thought it was ugly. looks cheap and ugly. I bought the scorpion one for my mom too and that one is really nice 10 times better"
1.0,They do not look like the picture.<br />They came already scratched a lot...
1.0,They look nice but have an unbearable chemical smell.
1.0,It was very loose and not very compressing
1.0,"I wasted my money on this shirt as I cannot wear it. The first time I washed it, the neck line never went back to the original way and so my bra shows and it's just way too big. It fits more like a 6x. Very disappointed."
1.0,The shirt looks like a little girls shirt. Returning
1.0,Broke same day :(
1.0,Didn’t fit at all! Had to send back and they made me pay for shipping! Don’t bother!!
1.0,I was so excited to order this cute swimsuit! I'm a curvy woman that has a large bust for my frame but I can usually fit into an XL or 12W. Since this swimsuit is listed as a PLUS SIZE WOMENS suit i figured I would be safe with a 12W. Boy was I wrong. I felt like a sausage link that was about to bust out from the case! I refused to post photos because I don't want to scar future consumers.<br />It's a cute suit and all but I suggest ordering 1 to 2 sizes UP from what you normally wear. Good luck and happy bargain hunting!
1.0,"Don't buy. This thing looks like a prize from a vending machine. I wasn't expecting perfection at just around $30, but I've got other Masonic rings for $10-$20 that put this to shame. Had it in the cart for weeks waiting for some other sucker to buy first. No one did so I took the hit for you. Not going to waste my time or money to send it back, as I'm sure I would get charged a fee and lose out. I'll put on a shelf to collect dust instead as a reminder not to buy something that has no reviews. You can barely see the emblem on the ring. Not even close to the product picture."
1.0,Too small need a bigger size like large other than it’s perfect. Please send and I’ll return the medium
1.0,Low quality when i received this the other screw on the side was loosen and i had to fix them.
1.0,Don’t fit
1.0,Not good way too small for an xxl
1.0,"These glasses were great, but the pin fell out of one of the arms in a day, rendering them useless."
1.0,Fabric is super thin; hat barely has a patch glued on; socks are thin dress socks.
1.0,"It doesn't work!! I bought two, one as a gift, and although they are lovely, they are not actual whistles.<br /><br />I am disappointed and will be returning them both."
1.0,Few complaints - The description says silver but I received gold.  Secondly the length doesn’t adjust to be a choker size if you have a petite neck.  Also the stone received is a lot larger and not as dainty as pictured.
1.0,the dragon part was so heavy wouldn't stay on the ear
1.0,This was not at all that the picture showed! Very disappointed!!
1.0,"The upper-portion of this dress is awkwardly shaped. The top-part would not pull up over my bra/boobs. This may fit a more flat-chested woman but, I (a c-cup) am unable to wear it."
1.0,Such a BAD ORDER THEY TORE IF YOU DO BUY GET 2 SIZES 2 BIG<br />AND THE LOOK SO NICE
1.0,Does not fit. Too small
1.0,"Got a cracked windshield, had a family member pass away, killed a very large snake on our porch, and our air conditioner quit working all in the same week. Not sure if it was the bracelets doing. I am just stating that’s all happened since we’ve had it. So it clearly did not work for us."
1.0,Omg I put it on and thought wow this is awesome ....not so fast after an hour of wearing I came home after my power walk nice and sweaty but my belt was already falling a part
1.0,Earrings broke within wearing for less than a week
1.0,"These are not the same pants that this company claims I bought years ago. The stitching is giving out on my old pair so I re-ordered and these pants and the fit is completely different as well as the material. Also, it costs more to return so I’m losing money by ordering these pants that are just not flattering or comfortable. Keep looking, folks."
1.0,Clasps broke after two weeks. Awaiting a refund. Very poorly made.
1.0,"made his feet black!!!! even after several washings! weren't even good enough to use as dust rag, tossed those out!"
1.0,I hated the fabric ..too shiny and clingy......Cotton would be so much better
1.0,Very heavy glasses and  drops from nose
1.0,Cute but very uncomfortable
1.0,"So bummed about this one!  I only received the top, no leopard print bottoms."
1.0,I ordered for a 10 years old boy and was a girl type and  size was too big.
1.0,"Hat brim as not wide as on a picture.<br />This product is suppose t be fordable for convenience, but when you unfold this it has such a dip crazes that you cannot wear it at all. I kept this hat on my table and stuff the top with towels hoping this would be better, but after three days is still look very bad. material is not wrinkle free.<br />Had to return it back to Amazon since product is not according to description."
1.0,Broke in two days.....ughhhh
1.0,"DO NOT BUY TIPSY ELVES! WOW. Oh man. Well, looked nice when I received the glasses. Bought these for a trip later in the year. Of course after the 30 day return. Comes in a nice case. The hinge broke the third time wearing them and it broke in the middle of the inside hinge. Not where the screw goes through or where the hinge is glued to the arm. No, the metal actually snapped in the middle on the one side of the hinge. Total garbage. Spend $20 less for some Target specials because the quality on these are awful. The lenses look nice, but the rest of the frames are terrible quality."
1.0,The product is non stretch and too tight. Does not fit my bust. Need size up
1.0,I was really looking forward to getting this jacket. What a disappointment! I typically wear a medium /large. I bought an xl and it fits my mom who is 4'11 and maybe 105 lbs. It is also a very stretchy/cheap feeling denim
1.0,"My son wore these for less than 2 months and they are broken. Normal, everyday use. Expected more from this product, disappointed."
1.0,I bought this anklet for my daughter for Christmas. She was excited and loved it...and it broke within 2 hours of her putting it on the very first time. It crumbled into pieces.
1.0,Even at the cheap price I got it for not worth 1 penny!!!!!!!  Broken and went to the trash!!!! JUNK!!!
1.0,My boyfriend won't let me wear them for my own good because they look ridiculous
1.0,Very tight and unflattering. The back is pretty see-through
1.0,"Besides the rough texture, it is too big and darn ugly! :)"
1.0,Ugly looking visors. It’s cheap so you get what your moneys worth. I still don’t recommend.
1.0,"Absolutely do not recommend. Very cheaply made, and half of them came damaged, beyond what is fixable. The broken glasses did not even have a screw in sight to re-attach the arms."
1.0,I wouldn’t buy it. Very poor quality. It comes a part so easy.
1.0,No lo lo recomiendo es pésimo
1.0,These pants run very small.  Not much room in front or bottom of pants.
1.0,"This dress is hideous. Despite my absolute hatred for it, I'll be wearing it regardless, as it is the bridesmaid dress in an upcoming wedding. This dress works well if you hate your body so much that you want to humiliate it publicly. If you have anything less than a perfect body with a good curve, just say no. It's not flattering in any way. There is a odd seam that runs across the tummy that essentially adds inches in width (visually) and gives a blocky appearance. There is also a strange seam that runs across the middle of the butt, completely deflating it and giving you old man ass. The dress is also very stuffy and something I would expect to see on the stage in Branson MO, circa 1988. It's straight tacky, looks cheap, and will age you instantly. The static this dress collects is insane and it constantly clings to itself. Any money you save buying this dress will be lost when you need to buy Static Guard in bulk. This will show EVERY SINGLE FLAW your body has from the butt up. It snags easily and I have several snags just from trying it on. The sleeves don't taper down very well at so, so you're left with an ill-fitting sleeve hanging off your forearm, like it's trying to physically escape the dress. It has so much positive feedback, and that perplexes me, entirely. I have to assume these woman either have no mirrors in their homes or were so incredibly drunk when they tried it on that they were unable to notice how terrible it is. On the plus side, it seems to be well-constructed and the color is nice."
1.0,The progressive doesn’t work correctly. I can’t see with them at all
1.0,"I just got these today, ordered them two days ago for my wife's birthday. She loves them, they're beautiful, but as you can see in my picture, one of the earrings does not have a hook. Now she can't wear them.<br /><br />The product is exactly what I wanted but this is bad customer service. If you're selling me earrings, make sure that BOTH earrings can be worn."
1.0,You gey what you pay for. The one i had gotten was broken and there was sharp pieces on the chain.
1.0,Beautiful shades love the shape and fit well disappointed on second fitting the nose piece uneven so they don’t fit correctly
1.0,"This shirt is cut so strange! It's definitely not nearly as long as the picture. I was really disappointed with how it fits, I even ordered a size up. It's going into the Goodwill pile."
1.0,Did not like matetial
1.0,I ordered a long sweaters. This one is to short
1.0,I ordered the wide calf leg knee high socks and received the normal knee high socks. I was disappointed with this product and will be returning them.
1.0,Arrived w black stripes and blue floral. Fit was true to size.
1.0,Rubber pieces on ends stretch and do not stay on the arms of glasses.
1.0,Came with broken chain. Cheap would not buy again.
1.0,The deal koi Wheel lock clamp was too small
1.0,"So the picture makes it look like the most wonderful thing I've ever seen, so I had to have it. Upon arrival I found that the metal bit broke off the glass part very easily. I wouldn't have minded that so much, just glue it back in, but what I DID mind was the awful color. The picture makes it look blue with a pink tree, but instead I got something that looked like an orangey-greenish puke color mixed with a metallic brassy sheen. Very disappointed. If I could get one that actually looks like the picture, I'd be really happy."
1.0,It had been folded so long on a shelf that it had faded along the crease.  Disappointed
1.0,Despite the size chaser way too small.
1.0,"These don't stay closed on my six year old, no matter how loose I lace them. They open and connect to the metal legs of his desk at school and they open when he takes a simple step."
1.0,Can't  change the date.
1.0,"To be fair, I loved these sunglasses. They looked good, fit well, and allowed great visibility into the water. But on my second day on the river (again, only the second day), I took them off and the frame broke in half. It's now one week past the return date and I'm out the cost of the glasses. The picture says it all. These are now garbage. I will definitely update my review if the seller offers an exchange or refund, but I'm not holding my breath."
1.0,"The material is not as expected, very small n sleezy"
1.0,Tiny. Not at all as pictured. If I don’t return them ( I hate returning things) my granddaughter can use them on her babydoll. Very disappointed.
1.0,Fits like a medium
1.0,"Sleeves were not as I expected, and was also much shorter than I thought it would hang on me."
1.0,shedded a lot.  returned
1.0,It was broken when I got it.
1.0,I'm disappointed in the quality.  This mask feels like paper. I am wearing another mask under it because I do not feel safe using it alone.
1.0,bag strap has already torn after only a few uses and i would like a replacement or refund
1.0,Sizing didn’t fit the description.  It was too small
1.0,"Too loose around arms and bust while having no buttons, looks like a cheaply made lab coat"
1.0,Absolutely horrible...washed out cheap material...unflattering pattern ...needs some darts in the sides to give it some shape so you don’t look like a balloon.......NOT like what’s shown...was a very washed out blue
1.0,This is a BIG LIE. The shirts in the pictures have the heavy threaded designs on them. The shirt they send you is just a photo copy dye print on a nylon fabric.  What a scam
1.0,We only received the top
1.0,"I ordered two tops, and they are adorable, but based on comments from their website, I ordered my true size, XL. They are super tight. I will never buy from them again. Chellysun is a ripoff!"
1.0,The colors do not look like the colors you see! Plus I got the wrong color that I asked for. These are imprints of tie dye.
1.0,"Super cheap mask, you can see through them. Foam stretch material."
1.0,not even fit my 4yrs old boy
1.0,"Don’t waste your money. Not at all like the description.  Sizing way off, not what the seller said it was at all."
1.0,Not for women with D size breast.. at all
1.0,Don't waste your money.  Advertised as leather but it is more plastic than leather.  After 4 months of wearing this watch band it already needs to be replaced.  It has cracked and the holes are now so large the hook no longer stays put.
1.0,So small they were ripped the first time she wore them not worth it
1.0,Not happy at all...way too thin....looks nothing like the picture....I could of kept my money and bought me a real coat....but why should you care.
1.0,I bought it for the Love on it.. it is not black and you can barely see it in the rubber
1.0,"Item fell apart minutes after removing from the packaging. They were bent even with all the packaging, and then the pin on the left arm fell right out, rendering the glasses useless. Also received the solid black lenses instead of the gradient. Very disappointed."
1.0,Bad quality too small 👎
1.0,Item arrived broken and couldn't see how to fix it.  The chain has a strange powdery look to it.  Frankly I was worried it may not be safe (cadmium?) so I threw it out.
1.0,Un engaño  total dice que es plata y es una mentira es puro fierro cromado jamas compro esta porqueria.
1.0,Very thinly made from silk like fabric and very cold to skin. It would make better for a spring dress though is for CHRISTMAS. I returned because it was very small. I ordered a size age 7-8 and it was more like age 4-5. Disappointed highly. My granddaughter was wanting this dress. She was also very sad.
1.0,"It came completely different long sleeve dress instead of short sleeve! Quality is very cheap, and size S is Huge! I normally wear size 4, this one fits like size 8! Going to send it back!"
1.0,Didn't even last through one 8th grade basketball game. The material was so thin it now has a couple holes and runs in the knees. My son is so disappointed as am I.
1.0,shoes had a fowl odor when opened.
1.0,So cheap material
1.0,I just ended up throwing them away....waste of money and my time.
1.0,I returned this top as it was too small… it was pretty.
1.0,Width too small to remain attached to the watch. Clamps are cheap and flimsy. Save your money - don’t buy this band.
1.0,Falso
1.0,"Jeans manufacturers need to realize that not everyone looks good in stretch jeans! Most look like they were melted and sprayed on me! This pair in particular would not even go up past my knees, even though they were my correct size."
1.0,A button was ripped off when I received it
1.0,"I usually don't write reviews, but I bought these in a XXL. I'm 5'1"" 210lbs and I usually wear a 2X shirt. I couldn't even get these camis over my shoulders. They were extremely too small and they're labeled as XXL. They look more like a medium. I'll probably end up giving these to a friend who is smaller than I am. The sizes are definitely not meant for plus size women like myself."
1.0,Just opened the package and look at this. It feel right out in pieces.
1.0,This product have a description that it will fit iphone 6; 6s; 6 Plus. Truth of the matter is that this will probably fit 6 Plus only. It is too big for iphone 6. So I have returned my item today. Other thing that would be buyer to know is that is is just a flimsy plastic that slides on the back of iphone. No protection at all if you drop the phone. I guess you get what you pay for of $8 something dollars. I would rather spend more for some drop protection.
1.0,Extremely see through.
1.0,Uncomfortable on face. Weird shape.
1.0,"50 days of light weekend use only.  So after 7 weekends, they broke and are unusable.  Eyelet pulled out, didn't think I was pulling that hard."
1.0,It had a hole where the sticking was missed.
1.0,The material of the dress was cheap and it fit awfully.
1.0,It broke the next day after getting it
1.0,This is cheap trash!!! DO NOT BUY. The do not show pictures of the back of the medallion because they do not want you to know it completely hallow. Such a scam. Such false advertising. This is why I do not like buying from Amazon any more or ebay for that matter because they protect their scammy sellers so much. And there is a HUGE SCRATCH on the middle of the medallion
1.0,I sent this to my daughter. She is returning. She said it was a weird fit and the material was scratchy.
1.0,"Ordered two sizes up, they fit my bum ok but they are almost 20 inches too long!! I ordered these thinking they would've been more of a Capri based on the picture. Not even close. Impossible to roll up. Will have to cut an entire foot off the length just to be able to roll them up to floor length."
1.0,"It came all smashed up,was packed in a flimsy plastic bag.not worth the hassle."
1.0,"Original review: It's exactly what you'd expect for $19.99...no better, no worse.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW, two months later: it stopped working. So it's not even worth the 20 dollars."
1.0,Very cheaply made. I like the style but not the material it's made off.
1.0,"The quality is fine; the fit is terrible, it gives you a camel sole; they itchy inside.<br />However, the problem is that they want to charge you for shipping back."
1.0,The patches were sewn on the inside of the arms.
1.0,"This is absolutely not as described on the page, and I will be returning."
1.0,"Although product no longer available just in case it comes back, I would not recommend."
1.0,This is not Asian body here. This is America size.
1.0,"I'm disappointed in the product I purchased. I thought I was purchasing a hypoallergenic belt, not so. I have a bad itchy rash where the buckle touched skin. Absolutely no stars for that product. As far as Amazon I'm pleased with website and on time delivery!"
1.0,I thought this would be a cute cover up but it isn't designed for C cup+ girls in mind. The top just doesn't sit right.
1.0,Earrings are small and the part that goes into your ear is too thick.  It will not go through.  Cannot wear them.
1.0,Color was not as expected and it looked super dumpy on me. Returned.
1.0,The look great but useless cheap materials not meant be use at all !!!!!
1.0,Color not as shine in the picture. Too big don’t fit my hand
1.0,I dont know<br />Good glasses or but came melted and deformed really disapointed
1.0,I ordered dinosaurs and received sparkly narwhals. They are cute and all but my son is none too happy. Product seems to be of great quality though. I’m sure someone else on my Christmas list this year will enjoy these.
1.0,"rip off not worth it ,,not at all what I EXPECTED"
1.0,This item sucks
1.0,Boots were cute and normally wear a size 11 but my feet are wide so I have to return them..i would try a size larger if ur n the same situation as I.
1.0,"Not the quality that you would expect from Tag Heuer. The frame is smart, no doubt, I actually loved it but the quality is pretty bad and not durable. The frame got spliced at the bottom and one side screw just came off randomly, which could never be fixed again.  When I contacted the seller they did not honor the warranty and kept giving me excuses of either stock availability or checking on with manager, but at the end no resolution and no response. Funny thing is they told me it’s not in stock, while they continue to sell it here on amazon :-). They have the courage to say such white lies. You can’t expect to spend $229 plus expensive lenses  and it does not even last a few months.<br /><br />So bottom line is, if you still like it, go for it and you may luck out, or after spending $400 (with lenses) you may end up enjoying it for a couple of months and then look for another frame soon."
1.0,"The cut is very weird. Low in the back, and slides down when bending over. Super uncomfortable and impractical. Do not buy these!"
1.0,"It's a very cheap and unflattering suit. The worst part of it is the white lining keeps showing up, why couldn't they make lining match the suit? It's so ugly. I'm returning it."
1.0,Look like a piece of cardboard don’t buy
1.0,Broke after 1st use
1.0,"I am not all that pleased with these, the material is not what I thought it would be. If they hanging in a store I would not have bought them. Material real streatchy and flimsy. I will not buy clothes on line anymore. At least in a store you can feel the material, try it on, cause sometimes you can go a size smaller, or you may have to go a size larger. I will keep, but will not buy clothing on line again. Just not what I was exspecting."
1.0,No padding.
1.0,Clown glasses
1.0,"The arms are so tight this started to hurt. I couldn't get it to remove so I had to cut off the sleeves. Now, I can't return it because I had to take the sleeves off."
1.0,I ordered XL - this barely would fit a 10 year old
1.0,Beware they are completely see through
1.0,Bought these in extra large but they fit more like a large.
1.0,"The hat came folded not once but twice. The creases are permanent. Like another reviewer mentioned, do not fold and fit in a 6x9 mailer. Roll the hat and put it in a tube.<br /><br />It also arrived three days late."
1.0,"This was not at all what I expected...it looks nothing like the picture. It's super thin, cheap fabric and poorly made with stitches barely holding it together.  It also comes in about a million pieces with no indication of how it's supposed to assemble to look even remotely like the picture.  Luckily I can sew, so was able to salvage most of it with some work...but someone who wanted the picture's look right out of the bag would be VERY disappoint. There is no tunic part, just a wrap shirt and pants, no robe, and the sleeves have none of that structure. Total bait and switch...dont buy!!"
1.0,Never received mine no one will respond not made in America
1.0,these broke the first day i wore them. one of the arms snapped off so i couldnt repair it.
1.0,"We ordered a 3x for my normally 2x husband and it fit like a large. Thin and small, don't waste your time or money"
1.0,Not at all sturdy and cannot hang heavy snow boots :( what’s the point of this then!
1.0,Im so disappointed with the color. Totally not the same color from the picture. I was expecting color pink and i got a peach.
1.0,Stopped working after the dog got device muddy.
1.0,Terrible<br />Do Not buy
1.0,They elastic is so stretched out. The legs fit but the top is loose. I can’t wear these at all to the gym. I’ve very dissatisfied and will not be purchasing anything else from this company.
1.0,"Be careful, this came up when I searched Alex and Ani. My mistake, but it cost me a trip out to shop on Dec. 23 for a needed holiday gift."
1.0,The slides would not slide without taking the glasses off rand using both hands. Could slide to stay on tight. Was terribly difficult to loosen. A shame I didn't pay attention to return  date
1.0,This shoe showed wear and tare like someone had already used it. Sent back!
1.0,"Pretty big waste of time, while comfortable this product makes such a poor connection with the actual Fitbit it comes off even by vigorous arm motion (i.e. running). Avoid."
1.0,Way too small. Not true to size. Very disappointed so I returned it.
1.0,"Didn’t fit as expected, was too big and wasn’t comfy for sleeping"
1.0,Theyre cute (dont get me wrong) but They're the squeakiest shoe I've ever heard EVER! Like all docs im sure they need to be broken in but I can't even stand the sound.<br /><br />Theyre also REALLY hard to lace up because of the stiff material.
1.0,To way to large and cut low
1.0,"Very poor quality.  Fabric is cheap - I doubt it would last a year.  Both Side pockets zippers came separate. The zipper is plastic and separates with just a little stress.  The sternum strap rides way too high.  Worst of all,  the torso adjustment is totally short.  I bought this because it says fits torso size 19"" to 24"" and I am a 23"" torso.  The max limit of this pack is 22"".  This put all the weight on my shoulders which is unacceptable.  Please pay close attention to this before buying because the return shipping will cost $20 or more - backpacks are light but bulky so they will cost a lot to ship.  Better buy a different brand."
1.0,Too small did not fit right or look right!
1.0,"I absolutely hate writing bad reviews, however, these bows are not made as good as they use to be. I recently ordered these bows for my 3 year old toddler and was very disappointed to find that on her first day of wearing them the bow seperated from the clip. My daugther has been wearing bows her whole life and she is not a kid that tampers with her hair. One day as I was taking the bows out of her hair, the bow just fell off. The next day I put a different color bow in her hair and when I picked her up from daycare the bow had fallen off the clip. I had ordered these bows before when my daughter was a newborn and did not have a problem with the bows falling apart, in addition, I still have most of those bows and never really had a problem with them which prompted me to wanna order them again. Unfortunately, I am not happy with the new bows. I also noticed the new bows have a tag on them and the old bows did not and maybe the tag is creating the issue."
1.0,"Cheap, cheap material. I got what I paid for.....very bad quality.."
1.0,it did not work and not fit for purpose.
1.0,THESE SHORTS HAS NO POCKETS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE .
1.0,Women's my arse! These are made for children or maybe a stick figure woman. I'm not a chunky monkey but seriously...these things fit my arms perfectly but my legs - not a dang chance. I don't know what &#34;woman&#34; these were made for but she's gonna need them to keep warm.
1.0,"Very cheap, felt material that was rough and has no give. Was afraid it would tear just putting it pn. Sizing small."
1.0,"We received a broken controller, item seemed to be made very poorly."
1.0,While I expect some shrinkage with a 100% cotton item these 2XL size pants are so short after 2 washings they barely reach my ankles and I'm only 5'5&#34;. The cotton is really scratchy even after washing. I won't buy this brand again.
1.0,I bought 2 and both arrived completely black and tarnished.
1.0,Poor quality. They looked worn out and faded after one trip to the pool.
1.0,"They are not pink. They're not even close to pink. They are purple. Straight out the box the Velcro is messed up. They are glued together. They have a few defects straight out the box including a small hole on the bottom of the sole... glue is sticking out of the bottom of the shoe and some on the top... smh. They were cheap so what do you expect... but they won't last more than a couple of weeks... if they get wet they will probably fall apart. AND THEY ARE PURPLE, NOT PINK. My daughter puddle jumper in the picture is hot pink... the sneakers not so much 😒😒😒😒"
1.0,Nowhere near thigh high. Barely came below the knee
1.0,I ordered a medium based on the size chart.  I wear a medium top in all other clothes.  This was supposed to be a tunic.  I am hoping it was a sewing mishap.  It was more like a crop top.
1.0,"Cheap, save your money. You won't want to use it once you have it, it's thin and sheds everywhere. Never made it out of the house. Straight to the garbage."
1.0,The lenses on these glasses are too blurry!
1.0,White bracelet is missing black dot. Also the price dropped from almost $7 to less than $2. Not happy.
1.0,Extremely tight front &#34;window&#34; slot. I put my drivers license in there by itself and it was impossible to get out. Ripped the seams trying to get it out. Weak product.
1.0,"I purchased the size based on my measurements and the item was still too small.  The material does not stretch, so it ripped in a bad spot that was not easy to repair.  I would not recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Sent me the wrong size and only a 6 pack when description says 12 pack.
1.0,"Tie I received was obviously used. Tie was under the cardboard it was suppose to be secured to, I thought I got an empty box until I looked under the cardboard. Neck strap material is frayed in multiple places and the bow tie itself is scratched, so there is a large spot that isn't silver. So disappointing."
1.0,Very Cheap. The lens pop out when I tried to clean them. They are polarized though but save your money.
1.0,Bent when I got them so they didnt sit right on your face. Returned them without hassle though
1.0,Got belt without a buckle!
1.0,These goggles did not last a day without filling up with water and the rubber around the lens popping off and being hard to put back on. Also the arm rippd off of one of them AND they did not come with a protective case.... TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!
1.0,"I would rate it with no stars if that was possible!  The picture of this necklace looks great, but the actually necklace and ear rings look like cheap pieces of crap!  I would not recommend anyone waste their money on this!  I am sending mine back!"
1.0,I ordered this for a teenager. Looks like it might be for a 6 yr old. Vert tiny. Not pretty at all. Carriage not even recognizable. Whole thing cheap looking. Want to return but not familiar with how to return.
1.0,Beautiful but very small for the price. They look bigger on the site.
1.0,"I have to say, normally i don't leave negative feedback, I just spend my money elsewhere. I bought this band for my wife for her Apple Watch. We did need to remove some links which were not as difficult as I thought it would be. She absolutely loved it............About two weeks ago the watch fell off of her wrist. Luckily it did not get damaged, but the band had come apart where it slides into the watch face.The actual post had separated, but I was able to fix it. This past Friday, the same thing happened, only this time, the watch face was damaged. I cannot return it at this point, and I am terribly disappointed in the quality of this band.<br />Avoid this at all cost!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Very disappointed. Was a gift for friends. Couldn’t read the text on the socks. Ruined a fun surprise.
1.0,"i returned these, mostky bc the sizing ran too big. but they weren't as cute in real life!"
1.0,This romper is extremely ill fitting and not flattering.
1.0,"Disgusting! Awful quality, wrong color, doesn’t look like in the picture!"
1.0,Not cute in person. Even tried takling it apart to make it cuter.. Didn't work
1.0,"The shirt fits well, however the zipper broke the first time it was used!"
1.0,I shroud have returned them .Screen savers would not stay on .I ordered different covers
1.0,"My charms did not arrive as photographed. I received the dolphin, the turtle, a sandollar, palm tree, mermaid and a set of crystals in most colors. I did not get the swimmer, sailboat, colorful fish, waterskiis or the star fish.  Very disappointing when there are specific ones you are wanting."
1.0,"Trash 🤢 took 20 mins just to untangle it and get it on, only for it to fall off at the water park within 2 days and get lost. No stars"
1.0,"I got this for my adult daughter thinking she'd be thrilled but when it arrived I immediately thought ""What are they trying to pass off here?!"" For starters the shirt isn't even the same color as the picture and reminds me of the leisure suits of the 70's. It's bad."
1.0,This jacket could fit my niece and she’s 7.<br /> I’m a grown man
1.0,Tarnished before I could even wear it
1.0,El producto demasiado grande
1.0,came apart after about 2 weeks.
1.0,The item is too short In the torso.. I ordered a size bigger on purpose.. It fit me just like the large and I ordered an extra large.  Very disappointed in this outfit.  Plus it was too short.  I will never order from this company again.. I have this outfit in white in a large.. The material is different and everything.. I was scammed.. I needed this in blue for a blue party and didn't have time to get another outfit.  Unbelievable.
1.0,I could not figure out the proper way to wear this sweater without it looking bulky.
1.0,It's a long black tank top. Weird cheap material. Would make an alright smock.
1.0,not as strong as most laces
1.0,The design is really cool as I love Harry Potter but the design makes it so large it covers so much of my face that it’s by my eyes and then I can’t really breathe through it even when I removed the filter it’s a fairly non breathable material. So I can’t use it.
1.0,I must need to cut my own nipple holes out because it don't fit right the way it sent to me....
1.0,"I bought the grey ones, after purchasing the black leggings and lovingggg the fit! These arrived and are nothing like the black ones or the description. They are NOT high waisted and have no stretch to them. I can barely get the ankle over my foot, no less pull them up to see how they look on me. I really need a new pair or a refund."
1.0,I received this bracelet in broken pieces and a cheap red rubber band was also broke that was apparently what held it together.<br />I returned it and am awaiting a full refund.
1.0,Dont like
1.0,For a Halloween costume this would be perfect.
1.0,"stitching was not complete in a lot of areas, one area the stitching did not take at all, I would have had to resew pretty much the whole dress."
1.0,broke within a week
1.0,"Returned, did not like the appearance"
1.0,very small sizing
1.0,Too rough. I got a rash.
1.0,I bought this keychain for my fiance and it broke within a week of me giving it to him. The chain connecting the shark to the key-ring snapped.
1.0,"I bought this bonnet for my crochet braids. It fit as expected, but the colors bled off on my forehead, pillow cases,and clothes. Because of the dye issues I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,Still in the process of returning but remember don't always trust the product pic unless someone has posted a pic of them wearing it.
1.0,"Very disappointed with the transaction from this order, including the time it took to be refunded.  The necklace was not as pictured and definately not as priced!!!  The necklace that was sent had a price tag of 9.95...so beware of what you order!!!"
1.0,Ridiculous method of application. There are much better options out there.
1.0,"I think I had this set on for maybe an hour, my neck and wrist started turning Green.<br />Nice set, very heavy."
1.0,Wasted my money
1.0,What I ordered vs what I got that’s all am saying. Not worth the hassles of returning it too .
1.0,"Don't buy these... I'll give them points for style, I love the look of these sunglasses. The arms are in fact made of wood, and the frames in general seem to be fairly durable, but the lenses are TERRIBLE, they are very thin, (I can flex them in the frame with little effort), and they distorted my vision and did little for the reflection of the sun of the windshield of oncoming cars.<br />I had these and a pair of $ 25 Foster Grants that I bought at a gas station and kept switching between them and my vision with the Foster Grants was way better and clearer.<br />If all you care about is cool styling, I guess these are OK, but if you actually anticipate needing to see clearly while wearing a pair of sunglasses as well as looking good, buy something else..."
1.0,"These shoes are very light and my son says they are comfortable, but those lubber soles came off after wearing them twice. I was hoping those pair I received were only defective, but the pair I received as a replacement were the same. They lasted a little bit longer than the first pair but soles came off again in a month. I had to return them again."
1.0,I'm returning it
1.0,Broke after 2 days.  And the cheap cover splits off.
1.0,"May fit toddler. Too small for my 1st header, she didn’t like how it was so snug on her mouth."
1.0,"This is false advertising.  It was 2 sizes larger than I usually get, but it would not fit even ONE of my boobs. This seller is dishonest  Alice"
1.0,We were very dissapointed when we received the flights. We didn't receive any of the flights shown in the pictures. My wife wouldn't use any of the ones we were sent. I will change my rating if I can get a reply and get the ones pictured.
1.0,terrible fit.<br />wouldnt stay on my ear even with crazy glue<br />for the cheap price it should be expected<br />wouldnt recommend it
1.0,"this thing is like a silky tank top. thats about it, i ordered my normal size and this “dress” makes me so self conscious like it doesnt go past my butt. big sad."
1.0,"I have two other H2H shirts and they look and feel different than this orange shirt.  First, the shirt's inside collar tag was different and didn't match my other H2H collared shirts and this shirt was thinner and poorly made."
1.0,"No es lo mismo que la foto, se ve con relieve y llego un anillo liso ???"
1.0,"Its smaller than expected, haven't tried it out yet but will update when I do.<br />UPDATE!!!<br />it looks like it has been used before and it doesn't help with stains. I've been scrubbing for an hour and my stain is still there. Not worth the hype or price."
1.0,I washed this shirt before I wore it and it shrank like 3 sizes!😱 I had to give it to my average size 9 year old and its just a tad big on her!! Very tiny!
1.0,"Sounds like a great product until you put it in your pocket and it snags the inside of it and it warps the key ring to where it won’t go back to its normal shape and whatever you have attached to it to slides right on off, especially without you knowing. Oh yeah, plus it ripped a hole in the inside of that pocket."
1.0,It IS HUGE!!!!!!
1.0,"this is a waste of money the same day i received the purse the buckle to close the bag fell off., really poor quality wish i returned it in time to get my money back"
1.0,"Seriously, this is a small, thin piece of material shaped into a turtle top.  Not full in the back and barely as thick as a t shirt.  I sent it back before I even used it. Was hoping to play a joke for xmas with family but it wasn't worth it.  If you're remotely  as big as cousin Eddie, then be prepared to feel like you're choking"
1.0,Will fall right off.  I have yet to find a band that fits this watch correctly.  I stuck with the original black.
1.0,"Was so disappointed. Way to small, at least 2 sizes too small. Really wanted them too."
1.0,Run small. Unable to return. Dont buy.
1.0,Not stainless. Not worth it. Lasted a couple days.
1.0,"I am thoroughly disappointed in these shoelaces. I picked the yellow ones because that is my son’s favorite color. We laced them in to his running shoes before he left for his Cub Scouts camping trip and they looked great! .... until he got there and started running around and playing. Then one of them instantly started fraying and falling apart into the nasty mess you can see in the pictures.<br /><br />He had to try and get in and out of his shoe with THAT knotted on the top for the rest of the trip!<br /><br />When he got back home there was no rescuing the rest of the shoelace, it was totally worthless. What a waste of money and time because even though we pay for Prime, the shipping was actually around a week late. I will be asking for a full refund."
1.0,Belt image buckle was silver but what was delivered was gold so has to return the item which was a huge inconvenience so am waiting for the replacement which I hope arrives before Friday the 29th.
1.0,Unexpectedly made of super itchy material.
1.0,I liked it looked like a watch but it didn't work like one
1.0,Just broke a little after 2 months and no way to replace. Piece of crap
1.0,I bought these because I had pervious ones with prescription. I recently did eye laser and still wanted blue blockers. But these were no where near the same. They have so much glare and I can see my own eyes through the glasses.
1.0,This watch would not keep a charge so I returned it.  I have 3 kids and I'm active so there is no reason it should not have worked.
1.0,"Cut of this jacket is not same as pictured on Amazon. It is a very nicely styled light jacket. The jacket I received fit perfect at the shoulders, then became slightly baggy down to the waist. The sleeves were too long. The fabric texture is soft and is a perfect lint magnet. Luckily I have someone to sew (taper and fix sleeves) so the jacket fits like pics on amazon. Nice design pictured on Amazon… this is a trash product as compared to what is being advertised. This jacket is for those with a larger Waist size. This jacket is a size Marge (medium for your shoulders and large for the rest of you."
1.0,"This dress looked like it was made from remnants of a child’s super hero costume. It was cheap and shiny, completely transparent in the white areas, and ran very small."
1.0,"It didn’t work, I had to pay for return shipping."
1.0,It's all in the title
1.0,"Would have loved to say not wool, but my feet sweat bad and stayed dry. That would be BEST of review.<br />Wear ladies size 8, socks are tiny, small and compressing everywhere, but radically bad is toe box area. Worst place ever to be squished in and rubbing.<br /><br />Seams!!! The worst ever on workmanship - big knots that caused rub areas, to make for hot spot, thus hot blister formed -my God the pain. Not just toe Seam,  but some big raised area on foot pad area too...that caused same rub/heat area to livid blister. For real!!??!!!!! A huge seam of threaded knots...wth.<br /><br />Do not buy these poor quality socks from Chinese made vendor, not cheap either...so tiny in size they left nearly a cut in my ankle....super tiny socks that have huge bunched threaded mess on seams that produce hot spots that turn into big blisters.<br /><br />I work @ Amazon, on my feet 12 hours on concrete, it's last thing I needed. Feet mess after these socks -  headed into our busiest season ever!!<br /><br />Really upset how bad my feet are after wearing last 2 days, my feet needed healthy for upcoming OT and our busiest times.<br /><br />So disappointed."
1.0,"Nice enough, but the sizing is really off. Not meant for Adults, might fit children. I tried this outfit, meant as a gift, size large, because it appeared to be small. I am a size small - very snug, and the legs were very short."
1.0,Wrong size even going by the chart. No support and cup sizes are way off.
1.0,Nice earrings until I went to pick up and the Pearl's fell off each and every earring. I guess you get what you pay for when the price is cheap.
1.0,It wouldnt come up on my arms at all and it said one size
1.0,The package said birthday cake charm which is what it was supposed to be but I received a #21 charm didn’t have time to return it had to make some stupid excuse to pass it
1.0,"I ordered a small, which I am, and it was ENORMOUS. Very disappointing  also, that I Have to pay to return it."
1.0,Very low quality! Doesn’t at all look like picture. Took forever to get here.
1.0,"Short and simple: I disliked this watch...I got this as a gift and I felt fleeced.<br /><br />Now, don't misunderstand this as some misguided ""hate-campaign"" against this watchmaker or product. If I don't have anything good to say about a product it's simpler for me to return if possible than to continue punishment through further use or utilization but, I actually received this watch as a gift from a client (who, admittedly disclosed a ""tidy sum of a price-tag"" upon presentation). Don't get suckered into purchasing any of these pricey Invicta watches in my opinion, especially this particular watch. Invicta simply ""sugar-coated s*** to call it candy"" as the saying goes...<br /><br />Now there are many many many other brands that likewise have completely ridiculous, completely unjustified, and completely, without-any-rational-explanation, bloated price tags that I could just as easily have had the exact same discussion/complaint about. After a few years of head scratching regarding this watch-maker's lineup, pricing and reviews....this seems somewhat the norm from Invicta (sugar-coating s*** for candy I mean).....which is a shame given the company's namesake& heritage. Truth be told: it's a poorly constructed Chinese made piece of fraudery and not a Swiss made timepiece as is implied.<br /><br />Within a couple of months of obtaining this item (model 1253), I noticed that the watch (which requires repeated winding in order to keep the spring ""charged"" with enough potential energy to ""power"" the internals) spring kept losing more and more time (read:required more than the standard twice a day winding per manufacturer's recommendations) to the point where it was literally just a weighty bracelet adorning my cuffs before lunch. Add to this the fact that the round, silver-and-white hour-markers attached to the outer bezel began falling off one by one until several were gathered at the bottom of the watch face and began interfering with the operation of the mechanics of the piece itself.<br /><br />After a few more months of intermittent use I determined enough was enough and as it is the watch-maker's policy to send money along with the item back to a service factory in Hollywood, Florida regardless of when you purchased/received the watch (note: most mid to high end watch makers include a specified warranty of purchased items lasting a for a given amount of time) I took the watch to a local pawn broker in order to just get rid of it. Now, before you judge that in doing so with a gift may be in poor taste, I did keep the couple who gifted the watch apprised of the developments with the item so as to avoid them from wasting their money like that again. Needless to say, the entire ordeal was an embarrassment for all parties involved.<br /><br />In no other instance can the phrase ""caveat emptor"" be more suitably applied than in the purchase of these watches based on the pricing, review and fervor generated by the t.v. retailers of this product. If your experience has been a better one than mine with this particular item then consider yourself fortunate based simply on the feedback net-wide on forums and review sites alike, otherwise consider yourself forewarned."
1.0,very thin fabric looks like night shirt
1.0,Came with a hole on it. Image was distorted on material. Cheap looking.  Instantly returned for refund
1.0,"I bought the first one and after one hand wash it started coming apart. Ok, did a return and refund. Bought a second one different color and size, literally just arrived, opened package and it is coming part and now sewn completely. I love the looks of them and the feel, but will return the second one and cut my losses."
1.0,"Horrible fit, returning item"
1.0,"Extremely poorly made. Raw edges in front are not even tacked down. Lays very awkward. Not wearable, returned. Fabric is not best quality but didn't expect it to be at price point. Does run small. As a sizec4/6, the medium was too small."
1.0,"Very pretty. But Unfortunately,  was never able to wear it. Clamp broke when I was putting it on."
1.0,"Poor quality fabric. The colorful trim was nice and of good quality, but the dress itself was made out of a cheap nylon/polyester fabric that was see through and uncomfortable. Unfinished armholes and neckline (ragged), and a poorly finished, crooked hem. Sent it back. The design is cute overall."
1.0,Thet don't fir for the size showed. I recommend select 2 sizes up or down your if you are planning to buy this short
1.0,Two of them unraveled at the seam within two uses. None of them are tight enough to stay on the face. The elastic is cheap and the tubes are very large. Will not be purchasing again.
1.0,"The band quality is good, the silicone feels good. The big problem that I have is once you put in the watch is almost impossible to take it out again. If your plan is to have only this one,  I presume it is OK, but if the idea is to swap I totally recommend you looking for another opinion"
1.0,These gauges made my ears infected within 3 days. Would NOT recommend.
1.0,Things fall out from the bag.
1.0,turned my arm clean after 2 days
1.0,I've had these earrings for a month and they broke last week! Loved them but so disappointed that I paid all that money and now I can't wear them!
1.0,THE CHAINS FALL DOWN FROM THE FRAME
1.0,They are not very comfortable and they are completely see through.
1.0,"Lost color within the last, a wing broke off after a day, and not comfortable"
1.0,I ordered a size up and it was still too small!
1.0,"Too small, the size was different then shown."
1.0,Way too short.  Should have returned the 3 I bought.  Not worth it at all.  None of them worked.
1.0,Wore it once and the back was frayed. Disappointment was it really is a cute top.
1.0,I ordered a small it was so big it wrapped around my wrist 3 times
1.0,I ordered this as a gift and wasn’t happy with the quality when I received it. The Hotwheels patch on the hat looks like a really cheap iron on patch. I wasn’t happy with the quality or how the hat looked.
1.0,This dress is a see-through night gown.  Very unflattering.  Dont waste your money
1.0,"Material is thick,  stiff, and uncomfortable.  Cut is boxy. Will return"
1.0,"Fit as expected, arrived at my home when expected. Too bad these water shoes are completely useless. I purchased 4 pair. 4 different sizes and colors. 3 of 4 pair didn't make it one day of walking around the water park my family went too. The bottoms came apart so easily. Very uncomfortable to wear. So disappointed!!! Waste of money!!!"
1.0,"These look so pretty but they fit like trash. They're hard to put on, and compress your earlobe on top of that. I put them on and immediately wanted to take them off."
1.0,The color is nothing like the picture
1.0,Ordered a XL but its fits like a medium
1.0,The belt looks a lot smaller then the picture. On the picture the diamonds go all the way to the sides of the waist and this is smaller and only is on the front of my tummy. I ordered ivory which is more $$ but got white anyway. Otherwize it's beautiful.
1.0,Old unchecked product. There was a line of sun damage discolored line in the frontal folding line..
1.0,Very cute but it broke after a week
1.0,Wrong size pips. They are too large.
1.0,Item tore on first wash. You get what you pay for :(
1.0,Terrible. Crumpled in a bag when arrived. Broken bamboo. Don’t buy.0
1.0,"This runs extremely big in the bottom. The material is more like a costume feel to me, very shiny. The top has a high front, low back cut with long strings. I would possibly wear the top with a different bottom like some jeans or something but it is very see through as well. Not a great outfit overall in my opinion."
1.0,I normally wear XL in dresses on Amazon. This one is definitely not the same. The fabric is also very unforgiving and it's definitely not a happy purchase for me. Very disappointed customer. I bought both the blue and the burgundy.
1.0,"I was hoping they would feel like a really soft velvet but they were pretty stiff. I suppose I could have just dealt with it if the color was right but unfortunately it wasn't. I wanted a vibrant mint/aqua type color but it was more of a dull green, not bright or cute at all."
1.0,After getting the watch it lasted for maybe a month & the battery died
1.0,It was no way close to the size it said it was
1.0,I DON'T LIKE THE TAILOR VERY POOR<br />IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN YOU YOGA OR RUNNING SPORT
1.0,Horrible product.  I should have returned them but my son needed them for a new job. Imagine my embarrassment when after wearing them driving to work I noticed that his hands were black. They continue to blacken his hands after 4 washes. Not at all what I expect from a Wrangler product.
1.0,"The material is pretty but it just wasn’t made for a normal human. I’m a lean woman. It had giant wide shoulders, a flattened chest, waist of a small child, but long enough for a tall adult. Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,"Fits great one time by the time you wash it, its time for the donate bin. This outfit shrinks so much after the first wash its unreal. Explains why it’s so cheap I guess."
1.0,The sewing on the dress I recieved was very poor. The bodice of the dress was uneven therefore making the dress unwearable. I returned this item.
1.0,"I didn’t pay enough attention, didn’t realize they are pull over . So they aren’t what I was looking/hoping for"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:52b6837a6fa3aef997812e44f479a97c]] This thing is so thin and flimsy and has no stretch. Absolutely not. I thought I was buying pants, not am itchy, plastics bag to wear around my legs. Instant return. 😤"
1.0,I liked nothing about them.
1.0,print was backwards
1.0,Very disappointed made like a gum ball machine ring looks nothing like picture
1.0,Cheap and way small
1.0,Splits come up higher than pictured
1.0,Ordered woman’s fit and it definitely was not what I received.
1.0,This product was obviously worn. There was a stain on the dress. There was only one stocking in the package and it had dirt and the imprint of a foot in it. Would not recommend this seller.
1.0,"Street sitting for12 hours a day at work, I was getting really bad swelling in my feet and ankles. I was really excited to try these for relief. I got the first one on and began zipping it up only to have the zipper tear right out. I was really bummed, as these looked like just what I needed."
1.0,They fall apart. Then crystal is nice and large but the metal is too weak to hold them. They fell off before I could wear them. The look would be great but you need to secure the crystal somehow.
1.0,way too small cheap plastic material..definitely for children not adults!
1.0,"Soft not to thick or  thin, not see through, color is beautiful (olive green) but do wish they would be a little tighter around the tummy.<br /><br />UPDATE: Went from 4 stars to 1 star and that is for the color (olive) The fabric is horrible. I was wearing the yoga pants for a few hours and when I took them of the fabric was all wrinkled stretched out and no I did not get a size to small. I own a lot of yoga pants and can wear them for a few hours , take them off and the fabric looks still nice like I didn't even wear them, I read everything again and it doesn't even tell you what type of  fabric they used only that the pants are made out of 4 different fabrics. They are also not tight around the abdomen area or legs.<br /><br />There are better brands out there for the same price which I am going back to buying, just thought I would try a new brand."
1.0,"I returned these, I ordered medium which I am small to medium and they were too small with no give to the material.  They would not be good work out tops and the colors were less than flattering very dull and muted"
1.0,Very cheap product.  Most of the flowers had fallen off both headbands.  They weren't glued on good at all.  I ended up returning them.
1.0,"Item very stiff, definitely would not fit a 14-16 year old. Both arms didn't fit together.... loved the color and grafic."
1.0,I wear 2xl shirts but this vest was way too small not even remotely close to fitting and I got the 2xl which is largest size.
1.0,It is packaged well. Although the chain is dainty and broke the first day I wore it.
1.0,"I had to use this skirt for a last-minute Halloween costume and it was terrible cloth. It looked like I had made it myself, and not in a good way. It was basically see through and came wrinkled up. Not only that, but it is not adjustable and for the material, it is it really should be. 10/10 would NOT recommend this product."
1.0,"After reading reviews about this company, I decided to order two sizes up. I am normally a size 4 and small. I ordered a large and was excited to receive my dress. Boy was I disappointed. The dress fit fine, but looked nothing like the picture. The hook and eyes didn't close the top properly and the stitching  looked like I stitched the dress myself. Please don't waste your money on this dress."
1.0,"I put it on for 30 minutes and the headache was extremely severe,  tearing eyes and pain"
1.0,"El material demasiado de porqueria, corren pequeñas y no corren de acuerdo al size."
1.0,Broke after 2nd use.
1.0,not mirrored. amber lenses. Not what I wanted.
1.0,"This item says its a medium.  But it looks like a child's medium.  Very disappointed and it took a long time to arrive.  I didn't realize it was coming from China!  I WANT to return this item, but don't see how."
1.0,Really small paint are like costume pants really poor quality .
1.0,Not happy with this product. Looks pretty but very poor quality. Beads falling off and the small bracelets are like tin foil. Definately not worth the price.
1.0,The chain quickly turned brown. The pretty yellow coating faded. Too bad I loved it otherwise
1.0,"The sunglasses are cheap just like the price they are too tight and hurt your ears , not very good sunglasses definitely not worth the price you could get better ones from a dollar store."
1.0,Each of the zippers broke beyond repair the first time we tried to open the backpack. My daughter couldn’t use it at all.
1.0,This dress was a huge disappointment! The top is completely see though! Looks nothing like the picture! Do not buy!
1.0,"Runs really big, cheap fabric & stitching, and arrived dirty."
1.0,Got this for my birthday and only lasted 2 1/2 weeks. Unable to return so it's money down the toilet.
1.0,Smelled like spray paint and tough to breath while wearing
1.0,does not look like picture at all. Material is completely see through and cheap. Might be comfortable as bathing suit coverup. Slits on side of the dress go super high up the thighs
1.0,Looks nothing like what I ordered. Very disappointing could have bought this at the dollar store if I wanted something as cheap quality as this was.
1.0,"Definitely NOT like the originals. Weak flemsy material, too thick, too long, & stretched out after very 1st wear. 🤷‍♂️ Offered no real compression help. The original Copper Fit were awesome and areI have some that I still wear. Figured I try these but they have become simply just sock drawer standbys after the first wear. If you want minimal compression needs and don’t mind kneecap high socks then you may like these, BUT if you need real compression socks, these will be a sad let down.<br /><br />This is absolutely No reflection on this seller, but just want to help save your money and time when it comes to compression socks"
1.0,Buy bigger because they are very tight.
1.0,"These shoes were hard, tight and very uncomfortable."
1.0,They are cute but unless your arm is the size of an elephant its gonna be waaayyy too big
1.0,"This watch didn't work in arrival. I put a new battery in it and still didn't work. The hands were loose. I contacted seller, but ever heard anything back."
1.0,Most definitely not true to size probably size up twice wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Way too large and very oddly shaped. It ties at the shoulders but the seam runs straight down the front of it. I ended up giving it to my mother and showed her a different way she could tie it to make it wearable.
1.0,"In my experience the shipping took forever and it cost more than the item. Only for the ""ew david"" to be a STICKER, it wasn't even stitched. So I guess I got a flimsy ass $19 hat when I could've gotten the original for $25. Never again."
1.0,Two+ sizes too small - had to give away - very disappointed.
1.0,"I am a pilot and don't generally need a UTC time hand if I am  flying in the US ( the conversion has become a habit). However, I looked at this watch at Amazon & thought it would be a handsome addition to my watch collection.The watch itself looks rugged but the time keeping mechanism is extremely flimsy &  inaccurate. The watch lost 5 mins in a 24 hr period. The GMT time hand would lag behind hours even after constantly resetting the time. NOT a pilots watch at all. You would be lost if you depended on it for navigation, or  run out of fuel if you would use it to keep an eye on fuel burn time. A very poor value for the cost ( $ 495 at Amazon).<br />Am very disappointed!<br /><br />Update: As mentioned above, I did like the watch design.Reordered a second watch. The watch hands would get stuck multiple times a day. Contacted Lum-TEC, they asked me to return it to the seller. Very poor experience. Ended up buying a Seiko SUN02P1 Kinetic Divers watch with GMT. A very handsome watch with impeccable time keeping."
1.0,Standard poorly made mask you can buy for 20 bucks at Walmart.<br />Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I bought the correct size, but they are 4&#34; longer than they should be. I was either sent the wrong size or the sizing is misleading. Other than that the pants are good and fit properly everywhere else."
1.0,This was one of the cheaper Minnie dresses I found and it shows. The threads at the bottom were hanging & shredded after 1 use.
1.0,"Too furry on the inside, comes off on your feet or socks and gets all over the place"
1.0,Won’t buy it again
1.0,Trash!!
1.0,Don’t bother if you have bigger than B cups
1.0,"This shirt is really cute and fit as expected, but the fabric and quality of the seams at abysmal. The fabric is weirdly glossy feeling to the touch and attracts all sorts of hair and fuzz. After one wash, the bottom portion of the shirt is coming apart from the top and there is a 2-inch hole along the seam. Terrible quality. Very disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,"This is a terrible product, I bought 2 sets of water shoes from this seller and the 1st set tore at my big toe after 1 use. The second set started coming apart from sole. I do not recommend these water shoes."
1.0,The product is not what it seems. Dont purchase
1.0,Way to big for me didn't like it at all
1.0,Description should say sheer/see through.
1.0,"No se parece en persona, totalmente diferente y corriente, lo regresé, no me lo quedé!"
1.0,Discription said it was viscose. Tag said 100% polyester.
1.0,"100% terrible product!!! Received the first one, yes your heard me... first one, in just a bag no box. This was a Christmas gift so not box was already a -1. Opened the bag and the mask was flimsy!!! Put 2 aa batteries in it and immediately a high pitched squeal started. Pushed the ligh button and the lights started flashing and the squeal started going on and off with the flash of the lights. Sent it back. Thought it was just a fluke... NOPE!!!! Got the replacement today and EXACT SAME THING!!!! No box and squealed. Same your money!!!!!"
1.0,"Only received a jacket, no pants included in the package. I tried the Jacket on and it was HUGE. I ordered An XS, and the jacket I got was probably the equivalent of a US size 6 maybe even 8. Wouldn’t say I have particularly short arms, and the sleeves were about 6 inches too long. Return was very easy though."
1.0,I typically wear a 14/16 dress and ordered the 2x.  It was far too small.
1.0,Pants were entirely too long
1.0,The size doesn't fit right at all order a large and fill like a small has to give the outfit to my daughter cause of the size if you order it a 2 size up
1.0,Won't protect like I thought and felt rubbery
1.0,I am a size 8 in pants and xl in tops because I'm busty.  I couldn't even get my arms inside the sleeves because it was too tight.  It's completely cheesy and cheap material.  the appearance is nothing of the picture.  You can completely see through it and the pockets are too high.  The sewing was all wrong on this suit.  I couldn't even wear it to the planned all white party that I was attending.  I had to run around at the last minute to find something else.
1.0,Never worded and I like the material
1.0,"it's a good product that works as intended, but the sizes are off and it is not worth the price."
1.0,"My feet/ heels got pushed forward by the back side literally down the hill to the point where my toes were on the concrete. I had to return asap. Also, be careful- only certain vendors offer free return, although free returns is how this product is advertised under. Not recommend at all."
1.0,Very poor making no star
1.0,"I order small/blue/nitrile gloves.<br />2- 1000 case, they had a coupon.<br />We got 5 different colors, when we noticed the beat up boxes. The differences in weight we did some research. They were old, defective  from the cuffs, dried out. Out of 20 boxes we went thru ten to give the benefit of a doubt. Some boxes/white had as little as 52 gloves."
1.0,"Did not like at all, very flimsy bar and doesn't stay on ear well. From bending it, it is more than likely to break in a couple days"
1.0,i had them on for one day and I took them out and they chipped
1.0,This is cheaply made runs way to small I ordered 2 sizes up. Had deodorant stains in the arm pit.  Not happy at all.  Nothing like picture.
1.0,Fell apart the first week.
1.0,"I own the men’s version of this shirt. It snags super easy and cannot be fixed, so the shirt is ruined. Do not buy!"
1.0,Band was very thick vertically so the ring did not fit as the size i ordered. Would definitely size up.
1.0,Product totally junk first day rhinestone fell out actually 2+ supposed to be sterling silver my daughters ears have sensitivity bothered her ears don’t know why other sterling silver doesn’t
1.0,They bend really easily... If you've get them thicccc ears I do not recommend
1.0,"beautiful suit, WAY TOO SMALL. NOT HAPPY AT ALL"
1.0,These are less than an inch big
1.0,Way too thin. It's like the thickness of culinary string. Unbearable.
1.0,Looks pretty but doesn't stay on the earlobe.
1.0,The black is straight black! Not like the heathered look in the picture. The sleeves were huge and unflattering to my arms and I'm normally a medium for length but it was just to big. It also looked like a fancy shirt rather than the casual look I was wanting.
1.0,I purchased these for my daughter and after 3 days the right shoe quit working! This is the second pair! Very poor quality! Will not purchase again! Don't recommend them!
1.0,Within 24 hours the Totoro figure broke off leaving the plastic jack in my phone. I can't use regular headphones any longer and will eventually need to pay a professional to have it removed.
1.0,Did not look anything like the pics. Will be returning them
1.0,Just not a good fit for me. It’s knit fabric and I’m not going to order knits again. Thanks
1.0,I bought these 9/19/20 today is 10/23/20 So I just got these for my little girl and she's worn them maybe 10xs (I think less) and the light on one shoe (left side) stopped working altogether and the right one is about to give out(only green lights up. I'm really bummed and irritated. I got them so she could use them on Halloween mostly cause it'll be a little dark. They're cute and she loves them. Now she'll wear them but without the lights.
1.0,"This hat will not fit a head of 23.9"" circumference. It is the only reason I purchased this hat over other choices I  looked at."
1.0,Pass on this one!
1.0,It was too large I returned it
1.0,I washed it and now it looks old and stretched out of shape. And has slight strains that wasn't there before wash.
1.0,the little metal piece that holds the clasp together broke on BOTH of pieces after being used only twice. very cheaply made and it’s unfortunate because they looked really good on the shoes I wore them on…
1.0,These pop in WAY too easy and then fall out with just a gust of wind. For the native freerider glasses... they even have a small gap in them now
1.0,A 5 year old could've made this shirt!  You get what you pay for!  Horrible fitting too.
1.0,"I believe these be sold as a package deal with a pair of needle nose pliers - which you may need to repair the &#34;stirrups&#34; when (not if) they break. Mine failed the first time I used them, then several more times (after I reassembled them each time - with my needle nose pliers). Finally I gave up. The clasp that holds the strap to the bottom of the pant leg is the culprit: it's similar to a suspender clip that would attach to the waistband of your pants - but the way they are made and the type of material used allows the clasp to get bent out of shape - particularly at its rear pivot point, where the clasp attaches to the elastic strap. I will say that when the clasp didn't fail, the product worked well - and I am looking for something similar to replace my now &#34;retired&#34; pair - that is designed better or made with more dependable hardware. But - this specific product - in my experience - is the poor execution of a good idea."
1.0,I do not like dresses that’s made out of bathing suit materials
1.0,"There is no stretch in this bra at all, my 15 year old very petite granddaughter couldn't even stretch it over her hips or her head to pull up to her chest,  It must be made for a small doll"
1.0,At first they fit great. Unfortunately after I washed them they became too short.
1.0,The quality is great and it is super cute but the torso is way too short.  I can't fit it over my boobs short and I am only 5'2. So disappointed because it really is adorable
1.0,The product I ordered was extremely smaller gab what the picture achieved! Disappointed!!!
1.0,"Looks like plastic that went through a mold.  Not anything like the photo online.  Returned--not worth more than $10, and I'm trying to be nice."
1.0,Came with loose stones and the chain portion looks horrible.  definitely get what you pay for
1.0,I did not like the material it's to soft it doesn't have the fat look it's cheap wasn't worth the money
1.0,"NOT WARM!!!!! And they were too big, though my hands might be particularly petite..find other gloves, preferably workout oriented gloves."
1.0,Very disappointed in this face mask. I purchased it specifically because it has the ear holes. The face mask arrived today and it does not have ear holes. It is just a solid band. However the print is and material are nice.  Would have been 5 stars if it came as advertised.
1.0,The two blues didn't match on the top and bottom and the shirt was too small. The bottoms fit perfect. The arm sleeves were short like a child's shirt.
1.0,"The first order came broken. I had a replacement, however, it didn’t even last for 6 months and it’s completely out again. Pretty disappointed of the quality"
1.0,This is not 💯 % cotton.  It’s a polyester blend and looks and feels very cheap.  Sadly had to return.
1.0,"I ended up not needing this product. When I went to ship it back, it broke putting it back in the bag. Not good quality."
1.0,Hated this top. Sent it back
1.0,"Cute, but don’t wash well. They pilled terribly after just a couple washes."
1.0,Totally hated the texture of the material and how thin it was. Did not like the fit either.
1.0,"At first i was very pleased with this bag. Beautiful dark blue, silver trim tons of space and fit perfectly under the seat on southwest. However the second time I went to use this one of the zipper pulls broke off, with little to no force to close it, and it behaved  like cheap silver painted plastic.  What a piece of junk. Buyer beware"
1.0,They leak. Ordered a replacement and they leak too
1.0,"These were torture to wear, but did it anyway because they looked cool. Ears got very sore, then infected. So that's that!"
1.0,quality not good broke after two weeks
1.0,didn't even last for a month. cheap quality and starts falling apart if you wear it and take it off a few times.
1.0,Sizes are mislabeled.
1.0,"Only wore it a couple times, without washing, and it shows pilling and rub marks where my purse strap was."
1.0,Product broke the first time I opened it.
1.0,"Appears to hang long, but actually almost a crop top. Not as pictured and I even got the largest size."
1.0,Completely miss sized
1.0,The fut was small . It like wearing leggings
1.0,100% not the pants pictured.  There is absolutely no flare and they have a weird seem at the bottom.  DO NOT BUY THESE PANTS. Huge waste of money.
1.0,"Used this watch for a short while then a screw inside starts tossing around and jams up the works. disgusted ,may buy somewhere else next time."
1.0,"I purchased this as a birthday gift.<br />It is super cute, but.. the zipper broke within just days of use and now to be able to return the item and get another I have to ask them for the gift back which leaves the baby without any coat in the midst of winter...and then return it and wait for another to come in..and hope it doesn't have the same issue.<br />Which is not a possibility..<br />So I wasted alot of money for nothing.<br />And am terribly embarrassed to have gifted such a defective item and not be able to make the situation up to them.<br /><br />ETA: I did get the refund and I purchased a different brand of coat that hopefully doesn't have an issue with the zipper breaking."
1.0,"It was not 27x27. One sided I'm okay with but I wanted a square bandana, not a rectangle."
1.0,Too small...SIZED for KIDS NOT MEN
1.0,Very unhappy it does not have the loops to secure it so it's useless
1.0,"The gloves are ok for gloves, although for some strange reason the fingers are very long (I have long and slender fingers but the gloves’ fingers are too long).  But they don’t work at all on my iPhone.  Disappointed."
1.0,I ordered an XL and received a bra with a medium tag on it. It was way too small and such a let down as I was so excited to wear this.
1.0,Double the size it should be. I’m 5’3 140 pounds normally wear a m-l. I ordered a small and could have made 2 dresses out of it
1.0,"My daughter was thrilled to get these for Christmas, but the 1st set my daughter put on had about a 3&#34; hole in the seat of the pants where the two pieces didn't get sewn together. The second set she put on had a hole in about the same place for the same reason. They were a gift from someone else and I didn't have a receipt so I couldn't return them. I'm sure the person that purchased these for my daughter would be very upset if she knew how poor the quality was."
1.0,"This is way undersized, sloppilly made, missing labels and sleazy.  The color is great.  maybe soeone will enjoy a pretty cleaning rag.  SJW"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9b8ebde4ce89e7f5a3f16f204d913dcc]] Pésimo
1.0,So a 5xl will fit like a 1 or 2xl just so you know
1.0,"Way too small and short, meant for a child"
1.0,These are too expensive for what you get. I naught some cheap t-shirts at target and made my own with velcro.
1.0,I guess if you like mirror sunglasses these are ok. I received the gold and they were fine. But when these arrived they looked nothing like the dark lenses I wanted.
1.0,They fell apart . Very poor quality
1.0,Ordered a 3x and my husband is barely a 1x maybe 2x and fix him like a large. He barely got it on. Does not fit at all hes not a chubby guy maybe 210 and 6 foot
1.0,If you like the Amish look then you should really buy this.
1.0,This item is nothing like I expected. Its like a doll toy. It's not the same color as advertised. It's much much darker and I wanted the lighter color as advertised.  Highly disappointed.
1.0,My bust is bigger than a xxl apparently
1.0,fabric wrinkled requiring the need to press
1.0,the dress i got was NOT this dress. i ordered a White Large dress and i got a large gold dress with sparkles on it. not to mention it was UGLY and looked nothing like the dress. buyers beware!!!
1.0,"Ordered a 2x because the description said to order up because the pants run small. Pants way too small. I normally wear a large or extra large depending on the maker. If buyers are made aware of where a product is made, we would know how to order it, or not to order it. Asian labels, cannot read them either. Found a child to give them too."
1.0,Product arrived drenched and stinky moldy
1.0,The fur came off the next day
1.0,Very short in the waist. Purchased a small for my daughter who is a size 2 and the dress was cut like a child's. The off shoulder collar is very restricting too. Don't plan on lifting your arms at all. Cute but not worth it.
1.0,ugly and ill fitting!
1.0,"Very messy stitching, stitching can be seen going from each heart  and there is a lot , unlike how the picture shows . will be returning"
1.0,The top looks nothing like the photo. Its tight under the arms and the front is not as deep cut as it shows in the picture. I will never wear it. I may look for a grandmother to give it to. Very disappointing.
1.0,Didn't like how it fits
1.0,The zipper broke the first day.
1.0,I only give one star because I was expecting the fabric to be the polyester/spandex blend listed in the description. It is not as described. It’s a satin material and that is not what I ordered. I would of loved the actual blazer in the picture.
1.0,They were way to small...
1.0,"These socks are made out of a weird rubbery material. The pattern placement was poor since they have seams on both sides. The worst part is that have a heel marking halfway up the sock. If I place my heel on the marking there’s tons of extra material at my toes. If I put my feet all the way in, the heel marking is up my leg. Either way they are not knee high socks."
1.0,This necklace broke after only having it on for less than 2 hours. Not impressed. Do not recommend.
1.0,Broke pretty much right away.
1.0,"I wanted a clean black and gold watch, however it had words on it that don’t show on the picture. Not my preference."
1.0,Don't buy! Made horribly... Buttons don't match up and material tears easily. Save your money!
1.0,"Too Baggy and loose fitting---hard to climb stairs.<br /><br />The ZIPPER is broken, I only used it TWICE !!<br /><br />Flimsymade /<br /><br />Send a REFUND PLEASE.<br /><br />Joe Moran"
1.0,None of the bands would work or snap into place where my original Fitbit one is perfect. Waste of money.
1.0,"It not real gold or silver as it shown in the picture, it is small not the size it shown in the picture, I am disappointed about it because the chain is not wide as it shown in this picture I am really dissatisfied with it  !!, it cost to much for stainless steel. I would like to get my money back for this stainless steel necklace !!"
1.0,Run small like crazy
1.0,"The jacket was a nice material. However, I ordered an XL because the reviews said it ran small. Well the XL was even too tight for my child with a 28 inch waste. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"Not going to wear these.  They were cheap and looked it.  If one can wear cheap earrings with the possibility of them turning ones ears green, then go for them.  If not stay away."
1.0,Size and color was off. The top didn't fit and had to end up giving it away. Waste of time an money......
1.0,I thought that I found a good set of Notre Dame masks but unfortunately these are not it.  For one they do run alittle small and the main complaint is I have not worn these but for about 15 minutes and the ear loop stitching ripped out. I like the looks of the masks but the quality is low.
1.0,"I wear 1X, should have ordered 3X. Material is very thin, if that matters to you. I will keep it to wear around the house."
1.0,The product you buy looks nothing like the picture advertised plus my chain was broken.
1.0,Hooks broke off earrings  cannot even wear them
1.0,"They are not knee high socks, lucky if they  come half way up the shin."
1.0,"Colors are not accurate, it’s actually an ugly hot pink. But it does serve the purpose."
1.0,"Very disappointing. The material is extremely low quality, feeling like packaging foam. Doesn't conform to your arm, width looks too narrow for 38mm face. It's hard and cheap looking."
1.0,Horrible. Button feel off the minute I tried to put them on
1.0,"I want to start off by saying that I do love this ring, it's as cute in person as it is in the photos, but it's just not worth the price they charge. It feels very cheaply made, almost like the rings you would get out of the 25 cent gumball machines. I was adjusting it myself and as I gently stretched it open it just felt as though it would break or bend out of shape very easily. I'm sure that if you plan on adjusting the size a lot over time that it will definitely fall apart. So again, I love the design, but for $16 the quality is totally lacking. I would not pay any more than $5 for it now knowing what I do."
1.0,product is flimsy but ok for just holiday use - the shipping was lame It was supposed to get here mid October I could deal with that I would get3 weeks of use  but it was continually postponed and came 4 days b4 Halloween so I am upset I wont get much used out of it
1.0,The collar opening is too small.  You can hardly get your head through the opening.  Very disappointed in the product
1.0,One pair broke 2 days after I got them
1.0,"My daughter is a size 13.5 and the M (13/1) were too small. They’re super cute.  Just didn’t work.  I am updating because I can not exchange these because the return window is too short.  These were a gift and now I can not exchange for the right size. With that kind of service and sizing that is much too small, I would stay away from this product."
1.0,Everyone of them broke on the first use. Did not over fill them nor was I ruff with them.
1.0,The masks are made all off an you can’t read the government part due to stitching also a lot of threads coming undone on first day use.
1.0,I didn’t have high hopes for these per the price point. They are pretty thick and warm but that’s where the positives end. I’m 5’7 a lean 140lbs and bought a small. Border like too big and I’m a small in ALL leggings. They’re too short for warm weather. The glute seems on the back are very unflattering and cut across the bum plus these give major camel toe. An issued I never have in any other athletic brand. Will be returning.
1.0,"i absolutely loved the sweater, and material. But this sweater fell apart after ONE use"
1.0,Returned did not like fabric
1.0,Cheap quality and look. Wasted my money and time. Took an extra day to arrive. Should have cancelled delivery now I don't want to bother returning them. 👎
1.0,Trash and cheap
1.0,It tarnished while being worn!
1.0,I have very sensitive ears i can only wear stainless steel or sterling silver or real gold. These said that they were stainless steel; they are not or maybe my ears do not know what they want because they made my earlobes itchy and they swell up. Do not buy if you are very sensitive to certain metals.
1.0,Returned them
1.0,"I ordered up several sizes. That part of the fit wasn’t an issue, it’s the sleeves! They don’t even hit my wrists! The sleeve length is extremely messed up! Save your money. (Coming from someone who never has wrote a bad review!)"
1.0,I didn't get my order!
1.0,I bought these since I can no longer find the Legg's Profiles and Hanes shapers. Normally they fit tight and I need to buy 1 or 2 sizes up so I got the XL and they are way too big and no support. They are knit material. Not what I expected at all. They are comfortable but not what I was looking for. Not happy:(
1.0,Looks great but is made for a boys wrist not a mans it's very small
1.0,"When these finally arrived I was disappointed to see that they're a cheap, flat brown rather than the distressed leather shown in the pictures. They're nothing like the product image! Don't waste your money."
1.0,"i had to toss these in the trash,i had bought this pair of earrings for my mother,one broke right off the rip,they were very tiny,but the earrings themselves were pretty just cheaply made"
1.0,Every single sleeve that I tried to put on my arm shredded and fell apart as I pulled it up my bicep. These things are such a cheap POS’s! do not waste your money.
1.0,Don't buy soft'n style 3 pc. Rubber color Applicator set
1.0,Too small!!!  Very heavy
1.0,"This dress had a huge pattern that looked theatrical.  The top part fit fine, the bottom hip area was to tight. It wasn't flattering at all even if it did fit. We returned it."
1.0,I am returning it.. it looks nothing like the image.. it looks like it has defects in the sowing.  It took forever to get..
1.0,Not dress pants
1.0,"I normally wear a medium. These were a large size & were too small. The material is also very thin. There is no uh.. boob shelf (?), so if wearing a bra underneath, it would be totally visible. This is true even when wearing a darker color cami. I don't think I can find a use for these."
1.0,My jacket arrived with spots of dirt on it that didn’t come out in the washer. One pocket was sewn halfway shut. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"Pendant is very cute, however the chain is cheap- broke the first day I wore it! Not happy."
1.0,Horrible. Cheaply made. Don't buy
1.0,Very hard to open I wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Soooooo small! And the color is way off. Super disappointed
1.0,"The watch is beautiful, but came no  battery, didn’t work, battery is dead, very disappointed !"
1.0,"color was nice, put it on for the first time and when i tried to take it of to replace it, it got stuck and i couldn't removed it, with all the pressure from me trying to remove it, the strap ended up tearing off and a had to use a piece of metal to remove the mechanism from its slot...smh"
1.0,"the bottom leg opening is huge, put these on with my hunting boots and the entire boot is covered by the pants leg, like bellbottoms on steroids."
1.0,The stocking would not in place on my legs
1.0,"This shirt was so see-through I could never imagine wearing it. The material is so flimsy, and not in a good way. The pattern on the material just looks cheap and awful. The length is also really weird; almost a dress, but not cut in a flattering tunic style. Returned immediately."
1.0,Box indicates that it comes with USB and also user guide but box did not have either. Disappointing on Christmas
1.0,Poor quality — tied one and the fabric crinkled and pulled. Could tell it could last long — sent them back.
1.0,Broken zipper when I tried them on
1.0,"I did not receive the dress pictured, I received an entirely different dress. The dress that I received was still cute, but doesn't seem all that well made. Also, glitter is everywhere."
1.0,Was not as described. Way too small. Cost me $16 to return and never received a refund.
1.0,I had the bag a week and it broke. Very disappointed.
1.0,The 2X doesn't fit. I had to give it to my sister who wears a large and it fits her.
1.0,"Very nice bracelet until you wear it. The balls at the ends of the bracelet screw off and mine did! It was lost within the first 30 minutes that I wore it. So sad and disappointing. I was, fortunately, able to save the charms and transfer them to a secure bracelet.  Not a tested item before rushing it to market."
1.0,Product is made in China and the size chart even when going up one or two sizes larger does not fit. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The digital portion of the watch works fine, however the hands do not."
1.0,Poor quality and definitely not as described !
1.0,"worse than I thought...I had hoped the flimsy zipper would hold up, but after a month, it is impossible to use.........do not buy"
1.0,broke within a week
1.0,Would not stay up.
1.0,This did not come with a tool belt like it was advertised. The tools were also very cheaply made and had marks all over them as if they had been previously used. Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,"Short jacket for quality look. In spite of picture, item is cheaply made with improper fit."
1.0,"I ordered 2 XL, this fits like a medium at best, I would send it back but it's not worth it."
1.0,The barbell isn’t smooth so it hurts
1.0,"The actual watch part is super cute, but not worth the price because the band is so crappy that it literally only was stuck on with a little glue... so now I have to go spend more money buying a band that is good quality."
1.0,Very cheap material. No screws so I wasn't able to order lenses to use with this frame.
1.0,"The latches do not release except with great force. And even if that weren’t an issue, the wires are course and flat.  Will be returning."
1.0,"I did like this blouse upon receipt. A little large but not too large. As usual I washed it prior to wearing...i just noticed that there are small holes in the front now, just above each pocket. Never got to wear it. Not sure if I can return this or not since I washed it. I will have to look into that. Disappointed for sure."
1.0,"Bracelet is pretty, but mine came with a stone missing (which was flying around in the plastic bag) and it did not clasp well. Clasp appeared to go over the stones. Ordered again hoping I will have better luck with the next one. Will update review then."
1.0,Came beautifully packaged. Looks just like the picture. Unfortunately I have worn it about 5 times and the clasp that is rose gold is already rubbing off. It looks high quality but I guess it isn't.
1.0,"Very small coulda got a bigger one for same price at mall,I got 2 gave one as a present worked well,the one I kept turned on stay one color for a day then stopped working"
1.0,To thin and cheap
1.0,The Item looks nice except the flag is crooked<br />You would think someone checks these items before they are  placed in the bag to be shipped<br />Returned
1.0,The inscription is poor. I could hardly read what it says.
1.0,This sweatshirt was very cheaply made and poor quality! I understand it was only $11 and I decided to go out on a limb and order anyway! Definately regretted it! I didn’t even take the time to return it so I just threw it in the trash
1.0,They literally lasted 2 weeks will not repurchase and do not recommend I was expecting something more durable since is supposed to be made for kids
1.0,I only got one wing and it was a gift
1.0,"Bought these to wear for working out but didn’t last long, they slide off right away with any head movement."
1.0,Dress was very poorly made. Fabric felt like nylon. Definitely not for a 12 month old. It was returned.
1.0,A week in to wearing them mine broke
1.0,"There were so beautiful!!! But the same day my daughter used to the school, she came back with one just in pieces!!!!  Couldn’t believe that happening just the first day that she was wearing !!!!"
1.0,"I thought I was ordering the Gray paisley bandanas.  Must have clicked on the wrong color.<br />One of this  pattern would be fine, but not 12."
1.0,"Awful product. It looks nothing like the picture. The metal is cheaply molded in the rough shape seen above but looks like it's melted and re-frozen in an odd and lumpy way. Unruly, heavy, ugly and unwearable. Very dishonest portrayal - the product is only loosely based on its pictures."
1.0,Waistband way too tight!
1.0,I am a size 12/14. I had previously ordered 4 pairs of the VIV standard black leggings (loved them) and thought I'd get a pair of capris for summer. I put them on and walked out of the house. I was at the bank and the lady behind me said excuse me but I think your pants ripped. My entire butt was hanging out.....
1.0,"I ordered an XL for my husband and they wouldn't even go over his finger tips. These gloves are like &#34;ladies&#34; gloves. They might fit a woman or a man of very small stature. Way Way Way Way too small, like munchkin small. I had to return as I don't know any men that have hands the size of a 12 year old boy."
1.0,Fitted strangely
1.0,"The material is awful. Also, I ordered blue and it is NOT blue. It's purple."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:644340b7bda6892c839bab5d09fb8ae6]] This is really sad and disappointing. This is an $83.45 dollars purchase for something that seems to be a either returned item or a very poor quality one. Wrinkly and damaged.  I've had so much expectations for this wings.<br /><br />I really want a refund, this does not worth that amount of money. I could have 3 of these for that amount. I  really wanted to  wear this for videos and pictures, so sad that I don't even get to see how does it looks like with all lights on. I wish to contacting the seller for a solution and maybe give it  a second but I'm afraid it won't last long.<br /><br />Spanish<br /><br />Solo 2 luces encendieron, abrí el paquete, puse baterias y solo dos luces funcionan.<br />Esta fue una compra de $83 u $86.45 y no creo que un producto que parece usado o de muy mala calidad pueda costar esa suma.<br /><br />Quiero una devolución del dinero y lamentablemente me quedarè con las ganas de probar estas alas en mis fotos y videos. 100% insatisfecha."
1.0,"There's a reason why this only costs $10, and that's the build quality.  Husband had this on his wrist for less than an hour before he tried to take it off and the end of the bracelet simply pulled right out of the fitting.  Do not buy!"
1.0,I did not like the fit...
1.0,The suit show up was so excited until I put it on.... it's so ugly!
1.0,"Very cheaply made, advertised as made in the USA, made in China instead. Shipped from China and tag says made in China. Buttons came off after first wear. Do not suggest."
1.0,CHEAP MATERIAL FOR THIS PRICE. VERY STIFF.
1.0,The mask we received did not look like the images in this listing. The mask is clearly a pixelated low quality image of what should be Bob’s face. It looks like a penis down my husband’s chin. Will not buy again.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Tight neckline and tight fit. Slits looked ridiculous
1.0,"Never wore it. Tried, it’s so tiny I almost lost it in the drain. I couldn’t get the magnet to catch. I don’t know how anyone could"
1.0,Did not receive the color shown. Be sure to read descriptions well
1.0,"Ran a test with my phone inside the gloves.  A faraday bag stops signal from my WiFi and the cell tower almost completely on a similar test, but the gloves (even doubled up and covering the entire phone), had no measurable impact on the dB. Really disappointed."
1.0,Dont buy this
1.0,"I'm a little disappointed.  I've only worn these once, washed once, and there is already a hole starting in the seam near the shoulder.  Very, very disappointed."
1.0,No sirve una puesta y se rompió
1.0,Turned copper color with in a few wears.
1.0,"The stem for these piercings are way too short which makes them not only fall out easily but since they may not come to the other side of my nose completely it is almost closing the peircing shut on the other end, making it difficult to input hoops since it will require breaking skin again. NOT GOOD."
1.0,Too short to wear. First band that I can remember had this problem!
1.0,"After one dive, the lenes came loose. Would not recommend this product."
1.0,It broke after 2 weeks right where the light for the Fitbit shows.
1.0,"My husband wears a 10, I ordered 11 and they were way too small, could not get his foot in them. Returned"
1.0,Not adjustable to fit!
1.0,"Perhaps I missed the part that said these gloves would take over 2 months to reach my daughter at school, where she spent the cold winter going without...now they arrive in time for Spring?"
1.0,"Unfortunately, tote bag appears to be cheap knock-off with zippers that stick.  I was looking for a zippered tote, and really wanted to like this bag.  However, what good is a zippered tote if the zipper doesn't work?!  Far too expensive for the poor quality you receive.  Don't waste your money, look elsewhere!  This bag is being returned."
1.0,It’s boxy it doesn’t sit right and it itches and the over look is like a moo moo
1.0,Magnet is not that strong and comes apart taking keys out of pocket
1.0,Black paint is coming off the bracelet. It was supposed to be a black alloy.
1.0,Beautiful earrings  Missing hoop to 1 earring
1.0,Bought a whole size up for my 3 yr old because let’s face it they grow out of everything quickly and they said it fits true to size. Nope. Tiny. They actually fit my 1-1/2 yr old. I called in to see if it was a mix up and sent the wrong size... no just poorly sized.
1.0,"I wear an XL in any other pair of leggings ever (I have thick thighs, but this product fits more like a medium.<br /><br />Leggings were cute though just not accurate on size"
1.0,These socks are very cheaply made. I regret buying them.
1.0,I received this and didn’t even try it on so I can’t say how it fits.  I was expecting a navy blue and instead it was more of a royal blue so I returned it the same day
1.0,Everyone is right.. fabric quality is trash.. its like cheap Halloween costume material.. DO NOT BUY IT THINKING EVERYONE IS WRONG. I did and i was wrong and it sucks.
1.0,They always rip after a wash or two.
1.0,Its so bad 😥. Fabric is so thick just adds to the waist. The size chart is off. I ordered a a Xl measuring by what size chart says. Its tooo big and thick. I wish i can return it but i threw away return bag and i don't want to waste my time. Plus it arrived 2 days late. It isn't the sellers fault the driver got lost. But it just adds to the disappoints 😞.
1.0,"overly small. couldnt get it past my head, and over my shoulders.."
1.0,This dress was so short. It was more of the length of a tunic top.
1.0,I just got this outfit in the mail. I was so excited to put it on and very disappointed. I am 5 ft 1 165 pounds so I got a XL this outfit barely fit. I normally wear large so I got  size larger and it still was too small. I am going to have to return in.
1.0,Do not purchase.. fabric is loose and poorly made.. it does not push or hold anything.. too long as well it will show from under your skirt and for pants it will show a mark.. and if you want to return it you have to pay half the price you purchased for return shipping even though it was purchased as prime.. don’t waste your time and money
1.0,"These hoops are so small that I find them impossible to fasten.  Chalk up this mistaken purchase to a waste of money.  By the way, 12 mm means nothing -- in America, use understandable dimensions."
1.0,Item was damaged
1.0,"I agree with the other review. The bottom part was too short.  I have the same suit in another color and, when comparing them, this one has about 3 inches less in the torso. Definitely a manufacturing defect"
1.0,Some of the stones are missing on both necklaces.
1.0,The color of the stones is greenish not pearly at all
1.0,Was too small for me. I would have had to order it about 4 sizes bigger
1.0,"Is a cheap hat, nothing like the photo. Can you say false advertising?"
1.0,"Uneven, not very well made"
1.0,It tarnished less than a month. And you won't get  your money back.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5d6cc6f9f44102c042b0ec5a677c4f01]] Fits and feel is good but I highly dislike the way they made the shirt - seams are showing on the outside of the shirt too!! Very disappointed ....will return.
1.0,"It states in the description that these will fit any 8pin I-device; however, it doesn't state that the products will just fall out as mine have.  I received these less than a week ago and the dust protector for the pin fell out in less than an hour after inserting prior to going to work.  So, I put another in went to work and the dust protector had fallen out within minutes so I re-inserted it and before I got back home it was missing AGAIN.  These are crap and I would not recommend."
1.0,Very clumpsy
1.0,The absolute worse product I ever ordered from amazon.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2e51938712643e9772f3d55752acf96e]] I want these shoes I’ve got three pair of them and I can’t wear any of them I bought them in a size 10 but I regularly wear a size 9 and they’re still too small very unsatisfied with all three pair but I cannot return them
1.0,Worst dress I’ve ever tried on... if you have any kind of breast don’t buy.... it’s small in the bust line so you have to order really big making it to long ... I don’t recommend this dress to anyone
1.0,Fake and looks like it came from bubble gum machine!
1.0,Cheap cheap and broken !!
1.0,Absolute trash. The graphic feels like a car decal ironed onto cloth. EXTREMELY stiff. Very very cheap quality. Came in 2 weeks late and no response at all from seller after attempting to contact twice. Once after it was a week late and about 3 days later I tried to get a refund because I assumed it was lost in the mail or I had been scammed. Tracking number given was a fake. No stars are deserved. Worst purchase I’ve ever made.
1.0,"Poorly made, didn't have the ring for a whole week b4 it brike"
1.0,"soles wore out in 3 months.  Holes in heel, excessive wear on front.  I do walk out to get the paper and mail.  Guess these are only for walking on soft carpet"
1.0,"I was in love with this dress when I saw it online. Unfortunately, the top is very tight and constricting on your arms. The material is similar to yoga pants but there is no give. If you have large arms I highly suggest that you skip this dress.<br /><br />The skirt is a beautiful pattern but the material is cheaply made. I was disappointed as the pictures made this dress look much nicer than it actually is."
1.0,I wore this watch band for probably 2-3 weeks and the design has already started to wear off. I can understand the flowers or stitch wearing off after extended use. What get's me is that the entire design is printed on a white band. So when the black starts to wear off and it's showing white underneath.... ugh. Looks terrible and cheap! Would not recommend.
1.0,"I wanted to like this dress so much. It’s a beautiful pattern, and I liked the length. Sadly, this will be a return.<br /><br />First, it’s a true wrap dress and the straps for the waist are all wrong. The one one the left (which is supposed to wrap all the way around your body to tie the dress shut) is far too short. I’m a size 6, but I sized up to an XL based on size review and being a bit bustier. It barely tied.<br /><br />Once it was tied, the v-neck, as mentioned in other reviews is far too deep. I was willing to purchase anyway because I thought I could wear a camisole underneath. However, when I put it on, the chest area is so loose and hangs too weird for that.<br /><br />Lastly, as mentioned, it’s a very thin fabric and will show colored underwear. The fabric also wrinkles super easy."
1.0,I purchased a coat from Ravean about 2.5 years ago. I have worn it about 4 times. The battery stopped working so I purchased another battery. Now it is still not working and Ravean believes there is a short in the lines in the coat. Bottom line- They are not able to fix their product and they clearly are made poorly. I would avoid this brand at all cost...
1.0,"I think the suit was just too big. I didn't exchange for another size because I didn't like to print. However, if you are a curves and love to swim, this suit may work for you. The return policy was easy. Mia"
1.0,Watch not work.  Tried to cancel.  wouldn't allow.  Never do business with this company. Awful.
1.0,These gloves are next to useless.  They rip easily as you put them on.  They were supposed to be large but did not fit.
1.0,THIS DRESS FEELS LIKE PAPER AND LOOKS CHEAP.SMALL.MADE IN ASIA?
1.0,"It is supposed to have long sleeves, but they hit at my elbow & looked ridiculous for a winter sweater.  I was really disappointed as I loved the color & feel of the sweater.  I returned it for a refund."
1.0,The pin keeps coming out the band. I've already lost one. Its a beautiful band but do something about the pin coming out.
1.0,I ordered one size bigger then I usually do and it still did not fit
1.0,Broke within two weeks
1.0,Cheap looking dress! Sizing is accurate but dress look tacky and cheap I dont think I'm ever gonna wear it!
1.0,Nice shirt but although it states that it runs small... it runs very small. I ordered a 2XL and this shirt was about the size of an American medium.
1.0,This rings are for girls with little fingers I had to throw mine away they wer like for a 3 year old ..ti bad they dint work out...
1.0,"I ordered a small I always order small small frame… They sent the wrong color it’s very thin material could be worn as a slip but it’s very long, I’m returning."
1.0,It is to little can I return it
1.0,This is not the big brimmed hat I thought it was....its a smaller version.
1.0,"The product states it is specifically made to fit Rolex Submariner and Oyster Perpetual 39mm. I put it on my Oyster Perpetual and the leather by the watch face/spring bar was already peeling. It Feels, and now with peeling leather, also looks cheap. I should have spent more and got a better quality band. I still expected for about $100 it would not fall apart on day 1."
1.0,I bought this for my daughter. It iwas super cute but the first time she put it on the clasp broke. Im very dissatisfied with the quality.
1.0,"Nice shirt, comfortable but shrank twice after washing.  Not worth it."
1.0,Beautiful ear ring...I was so excited about it...within a week my ear was sore and took the earring out only to find it was turning my ear GREEN...stainless steal has never been a problem for my ears so the only thing I can figure is...it's not real. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Cute pattern  but the apron was so small. Maybe a childs size but not big enough for an average adult. Also, the apron I got didn't only had 8 pockets.  I returned it because I needed something bigger and more usable."
1.0,The sizing is not realistic. Tag in garment is not Niepec. Super disappointing. Do not recommend.
1.0,Where to start... CHEAP material and one of the back straps twisted then sewn. Trash.
1.0,Looks great I’m the picture but I’m reality is cheaply made and the fabric s not good quality. Looks more like a fantasy custom
1.0,This runs too small.
1.0,"I got two pairs of these sunglasses and both of them came with one of the hinges going further than the other one. Because of this, when I put them on they were visibly lopsided, with one of the eyepieces going further out than the other. If you are looking to buy sunglasses, I would advise looking elsewhere."
1.0,What an epic dissapointment. For this high price too. Total garbage material. It's like some sort of cheap think polyester. It's an Xmas gift and now now time to even return it. What a piece of garbage. Do yourselves a favor and don't buy this. One wash and rhe cheap iron on will start to break away. I'm sure of it. Rubbish. Shame on whoever is selling g this for such a price. Not even worth 10.00
1.0,"Poor, poor quality"
1.0,I took it out of the package and dropped it on the floor.  The metal part that attaches the strap to the purse broke.
1.0,You only get one but they show 2 and the quality is terrible. Pass on this
1.0,The material is very thin and cheap and is in no way sweatshirt material.
1.0,It’s terrible
1.0,I put it on and it was heavy which is fine I got used to that. I’ve only had this watch band 26 days and the finish has rubbed off and after a few days the clear new teen the bands started to look dirty. Now some parts are almost not clear because of the metal pieces holding the watch band together. It just hasn’t held up. I’m going to have to look for a new band.
1.0,Este no ha llegado. Donde esta por favor. Gracias
1.0,I ordered a gold and black mask and I received a black and silver one. I did not ask for silver. And the black mask came with white paint dripping from its eyes. Thumbs down.
1.0,Wouldn’t waste my money . Charm fell off bracelet . Didn’t hold up & bad investment 👎
1.0,Bad quality! Looks cheap
1.0,This dress was made of terrible quality material. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"it was pretty and fit well, but it broke in half after a couple weeks"
1.0,I ordered these shoes for my daughter's first birthday pictures and sent them back right after opening the box. They are NOT blue. These shoes are a light purple.
1.0,Color looks like rust not Rose Gold
1.0,The emblem was a sticker....don't buy this
1.0,"No es acero inoxidable y se le filtra el agua, estos relojes son de mala calidad<br /><br />Compre 2 y los 2 se tornaron negros"
1.0,"I had to return this necklace, it was very rough, abrasive on my skin."
1.0,This band is very flimsy . Constantly coming off my wrist
1.0,"I am 5ft 2in tall and weigh 110lbs. Based on all of the other reviews, I ordered a medium although I am normally a small. I was able to zip the skirt, and could have worn it, as long as I didn’t breath. This skirt must be made for children because no adult could fit in them based on their sizing."
1.0,Se rompió Rápido el metal alparecer es viejo y de mala calidad se partió
1.0,Ordered 2 of them to give as a gift. Both didn't fit the width of the band is wider than the watch and it doesn't match the face of the watch. Returning it.
1.0,"I wanted to love this bikini but there’s so many issues. The fabric is rough and scratchy, the bikini itself is too small. The “V” in the center of the top pokes into your chest so there’s so way of comfortably wearing it. Would not recommend"
1.0,"It came in tangled, when I tried to untangle it, it broke in half."
1.0,The dress sizes are not accurate at all
1.0,The fabric was very thin and the dress looks very cheap
1.0,This hung like drapery - I don't know who can possibly wear this????  Nothing like pic!!!
1.0,Dress is irregular
1.0,Headphones were broken inside hat.
1.0,"Looks good in a picture.... but, doesn't even come close.  I think for the money spent on it, ($49.99).  It could a least have the ""Hunter Games"" logo on it..  VERY disapointing...... I hope that the jacket looks and does better than this....."
1.0,"Do Not Buy!!<br />I bought this chain because I liked the tarnished look and the &#34;box&#34; chain pattern.  The first one I bought I had on less that 24 hours and it fell off in the shower.  The links just broke, a clean break.  I thought maybe it was a defect so I started the return process with Amazon (which went nowhere), and purchased another one.  The second chain I had for maybe  a month and ended up on the floor around my feet in the operating room I was working in.<br />Looks nice but terrible quality."
1.0,Very bad design fit loose and does not look like the picture.
1.0,"Update 4/19/17<br />I didn't mind the small sleeves on the black dress &amp; ordered a red one. The red one's material was a little more stretchy and seemed maybe more roomy. So I ordered a 3rd dress, blue, it came in the mail today. This dress size is not properly marked. It is more straight and not flowy at all - more A-line shape. It has the same look at first, same hem style, but when tried one is way too small.<br /><br />It really is a bummer that there is such a size variance.<br /><br />The thickness &amp; quality of the material is 5 star.<br />The fullness of the dress is very nice.<br />For being a fuller dress, the arms are tight. The chest is not tight, but lays nice (I think if it was too full @ the chest it would be like a moo moo dress).<br />I really like the dress &amp; have ordered another one (different color).<br /><br />Would I recommend This dress? If you are patient and willing to possibly send product back for correct sizing (on the body of the dress.<br />Just be cautioned, the arms are really slim (my only complaint)."
1.0,These earrings are very cheaply made and not as attractive when seen in person.  Much larger than expected.  Would not buy from this vender again.  Clasp of earrings do not hold well for size. Disappointed.
1.0,Not as pictured! The one i got is like an A -line rather than the one showed in pix which is a little curvy. Cloth looks very cheap and thin. Very disappointed with this product. Beware!!!
1.0,I bought these but wish I didn't. Wanted to return and had question. Response: canned message that didn't answer my question. I chalk this one up to buyers beware. The quality is very good either. Have bought Quxiangin the past and found them to fit better and a lot better quality. ; (
1.0,"The t-shirt I received is nothing like what’s pictured/advertised! It’s a bright yellow, and the brand is a generic, cheap t-shirt company, not “Official Goat Gear”. Also, I paid the $9.99 shipping to get it in time for the Super Bowl...it showed up almost 3 weeks after I ordered it (not on time!). I’d return it, but I have a feeling I’d never see a refund. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
1.0,BUYER BEWARE! Colors shown are NOT what you will receive. I really needed the exact shade of pink shown in the product photo. What I received was a very very dark “dusty pink”. It’s completely unusable for what I needed it for.
1.0,This product is nice but the watch clips broke after wearing it for 2 days
1.0,Tarnishes fast
1.0,i love these shoes had two pairs had to return.
1.0,Color faded and way off. Spend your money elsewhere.
1.0,"You can put your Apple Airtag in the little hole in this card, but it won't stay. So what's the point? It'll fall out. It needs to be able to snap in and stay secure. I'm mailing mine back. Worthless."
1.0,"The hardware is of a poor quality. Do what I did and get one from PerFit ZULU4 (not a paid endorsement, just my experience)."
1.0,"These run too large, and fit awkwardly"
1.0,"They fit fine over my glasses.  Each lens makes the sun light look like 2 lights coming at you in your direct line of vision. The night vision lens were great for the glare, but they also made it look like you had multiple car lights in your direct line of vision, too.  They were not safe to wear."
1.0,Don't waste your money- 99 cent store quality
1.0,"Pieces broken, top is HUGE and bottoms are so small they don’t fit. Really really disappointed for the price"
1.0,Cheap mesh fabric and don’t run true to size. I ordered a 3xL and they fit like a xL. I’m only 6’ 260lb. You would think a 3xL would fit? Will never buy again.
1.0,Not very good they actually don't stay on your ears not secure and hard to fix the back to be able to wear them

1.0,"Not happy at all with this tank top! The scoop neck sags and the whole top is way too big. When ordering, a smaller size is necessary. I probably won’t ever wear this outside. It will take up draw space. Find another product!"
1.0,Cute but cheaply made and doesn't last broke almost immediately
1.0,Wore out and looks like crap after just over a year. Disappointed.
1.0,"There is no stretch at all, so I couldn’t even get it over my head :( I returned!"
1.0,Arrived bent
1.0,Broken in a week
1.0,"These earrings are uniquely striking (I got the green ones) and feel lightweight and comfortable. However, I’m disappointed with how they arrived. They were delivered with one of posts bent as to be unusable, and the other completely broken off and loose inside the packaging. They came in a simple, unpadded cellophane bag. The packaging really needs to be much sturdier to protect them from other things they might be shipped with."
1.0,"Ordered these in October for an Xmas gift. Didn't realize they came ripped in the crotch, and now it's too late to return them. Not happy"
1.0,The dress does not look like the picture and is not fashionable at all.
1.0,"While the design is lovely, as soon as the weather warmed up the plating started coming off and my neck turned green."
1.0,These pants do not fit. Not even close. They were way smaller than they  were sized as.
1.0,"I wear a 1x and read the reviews before ordering and they said they shrink badly,  so I ordered a 4x.. they dont even cover all of my butt.. I was so excited to get them, only to be disappointed 😥 they looked cheap too, so sad"
1.0,I received an empty package. I opened the mailbox to find a bag that was opened and empty.
1.0,Doesn't wrap on top of ear like picture
1.0,This product was defective. The collars were mismatched and there were holes inside some of the t-shirts. They were very cheap looking as well.
1.0,cheap as hell and ugly in real life.
1.0,"I expected this bag to be softer and it is also larger than I anticipated.  I would return it, but there were no return instructions included in the package.  The perils of ordering online!"
1.0,Necklace does not resemble the one advertised online.
1.0,"I didn't purchase from Amazon, but I'd like other people to know the fact.<br /><br />This is a very beautiful watch to me. The auto wind up was not enough for daily movement.  I had to wind it everyday.  Until one day I cannot wind it at all, It just stuck. The watch won't move.  It can run when I shake it, but I cannot shake 24 hours everyday. Just 3 months, the pretty watch became a piece of metal.<br /><br />For all the people who plan to buy it (because looks so beautiful), thinking it to buy from other bland watches or just waste your money in months."
1.0,I oredered a sporty design and i got something entirely diff. The shirt was sized for a teenage girl making it unusable and the pants fit better but offer no compression at all. I was gonna return it but it was gonna take firever so i just trashed it. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
1.0,Not what I ordered. HUGE. Not like the 9 others I got. Now I am 1 short for bridal party gifts. Thanks
1.0,Terrible.  Seam ripped out of crouch.  Pockets tore from iphone being carried in back pockets.  Overall bad product.
1.0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!......size 38 would not fit a grown man. I ordered this for my autistic son birthday present. Very sad, I couldn't give this to him on his birthday. Extremely frustrating having to deal with incorrect sizing just to make a buck."
1.0,"The rubber part of the bands, started shredding and falling apart within a couple of days. Within a week, the entire band broke."
1.0,Does not support c cups at all. It's on its way back for a refund.
1.0,It continuously fell apart - really embarrasing
1.0,"Awful quality. I feel like I’m wearing a tablecloth from Dollar Tree. I bought this to replace a soft cotton dress that looked exactly the same and had the same advertising image, but this was definitely a cheap fake."
1.0,The fabric is soft but has permanent wrinkles on the entire dress. You can’t even use a steamer or steam iron. Right in the trash.
1.0,Received a leopard print faux fur coat when I ordered the black one pictured. Horrible fit and cheap. Looks like something from a Halloween costume. You have to pay for the return so I just gave it to Goodwill
1.0,The length on these are horrible. I'm 5'4 and they fit like capris. Will be returning.
1.0,Ordered per the sizing chart- fit way too small. Also the products straps across the back were also sewn incorrectly
1.0,"The shirt worked for a few hours.  I charged the charger and tried to use it again.  However, it would turn on for a second and then turn off.  I tried a different charger - it is the shirt, not the charger."
1.0,the clasp doesnt shut securely and several times it has opened up and i have lost items.
1.0,They are so small. They may work for a six year old.
1.0,Returned - about two sizes too small!
1.0,Doesn't fit right.. 2 sizes too small. Unfortunately I need to return it
1.0,Shirts were too small while pants fit perfect
1.0,Doesn't keep correct time. Slow and cheap.
1.0,what a piece of junk
1.0,I ended up retuning this because it was completely shapeless and the little shrug was a weird shape that didn't fit well. Very sad because it looked very cute online.
1.0,"The description said it was a sweatshirt, it is not. It is a long sleeve crew neck shirt. Since it was expensive we didn't hesitate thinking it was a sweatshirt."
1.0,This tarnished after just one time wearing it.  I know it was cheap but woild have like to have worn more than once without it turning colors.
1.0,Zipper broke 2 weeks after item was received.
1.0,The shipping took a long time. When It arrived it was not the scarf pictured. It was not the same color. It was not the same pattern. It was not what I ordered.
1.0,VERY cheaply made. Already broke.
1.0,Supposed to be blue. It is gray.
1.0,Not what i expected :(
1.0,Very Bad quality
1.0,Poor zipper quality
1.0,They broke right away.
1.0,"I've been using this style of wallet since college, and they're hard to find online.  I found this on an outside website but bought it via Amazon.  Very low quality.  The ones I bought at my college bookstore would last for years.  This was over twice the cost and wasn't usable after 3 months.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Poor quality with plastic smell.
1.0,I returned the shoes poor quality material for the price that they were no support around my foot which I think is important any time you were wearing any kind of a heel to have support so your foot doesn’t slip back-and-forth and you hurt your ankle
1.0,"Cute, but ran very small"
1.0,"This is the second time I ordered this dress (first one was defective- upside down skirt). And this second dress? Not even CLOSE to the dress I actually ordered. What I received was a sweater dress with a giant reindeer on the front, shiny nose awkwardly positioned “below my belly button.“ Don’t bother."
1.0,broken when received
1.0,"I am disappointed in this product. After only two weeks of wear, the stitching is already falling apart. It has exposed some glue, which is uncomfortable to the touch. I can already hear my daughter complaining about her head being rubbed raw by that section. I will need to purchase something new, which is frustrating since i purchased two."
1.0,Pretty cheaply made. Not for the lip as indicated as a possibility in the info. Was actually pretty irritating.
1.0,"Terrible!  Is supposed to be 1.75 yet they are blurry.  Yes, the clear protective cover was removed.  Very cheap."
1.0,Did not fit well and I didn’t like the fabric.
1.0,Nunca llegó el pedido ni la devolución del dinero
1.0,"These plastic tongue studs are junk.  The are super short so they squeeze your tongue, like pinching, and the edges are kind of sharp on the flat end so it hurts.  The tiny little o- ring the slips on to hold it barely holds on because it is so tight on your tongue.  I tried putting one in the minute I got them and they were all in the trash less than 5 minutes later.  Don't waste your money on these!"
1.0,"This product fell apart the year following purchase!  It was not used very much at all and when I went on a trip it started coming apart at the bottom seams and then when I was walking with it over my shoulder, the grommet holding the handle in came right out.  This product is garbage and not worth buying.  Very disappointed in Amazon for carrying such a vendor!"
1.0,Daughter tried it on before her first dance class and showed me the stitching was undone.
1.0,I wish i did not have to give a star because it does not deserve not even one. The quality is so poor i only wore it once before the band broke..do not waste your money on this product
1.0,"To thin, too tall, too tight, rolls up on itself"
1.0,"HORRIBLE. They are cheap, plastic, and not even what so ever. They aren't even smooth so it hurts to even try putting them in. I will probably never do anything with them because of how crappy they are."
1.0,Cheap all plastic sunglasses. Not comfortable either. Maybe worth $5
1.0,Battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes in these. They are of no more use than regular gloves.
1.0,"This's is the worst floats Ihave ever bought. I had to glue the top so the line would snap in, I did not know that I would have to fix 20 of the 24 I order."
1.0,Arrived broken 😭
1.0,It’s ugly & cheap looking
1.0,Cheaply made and came with hole
1.0,They rusted really fast
1.0,I received only the bubble package today but there was nothing inside.
1.0,Very large and baggy for an adult female
1.0,To small and I didn't got what I saw in the picture. Totally different from the picture
1.0,Was very comfortable. But it was missing the button on the back & they look like pjs
1.0,"HUGE in person, not as I expected. Had to return."
1.0,This bag is far smaller than advertised.... I'm totally dissatisfied with it.... The material is good but it looks a purse for a baby😡😡
1.0,"Do not get this item, I'm 5'7 and it said regular, and I had way too much extra fabric. And the waist is too small. Will not recommend. It was like putting nylons on."
1.0,Case did not even last a week before the back design started peeling off.
1.0,Fell off my neck the first day I put it on.  :(  too bad it was cute.  :(
1.0,I was so excited to get the dress and it came in today and I was so disappointed.  The material and style were not like the picture at all. I would NOT recommend this at all. I only posted this to help anyone out that is interested in this dress. I wear size XL and this is an XL and way small at the top. Returning this. Very disappointed.
1.0,The head of the pearl is too large for the back.  It needs more support.  And the backing is nickel and caused a. Allergic reaction.
1.0,The quality of this item is very cheap but all in all it's cute. Would not buy from this company again
1.0,This item rises up while working out
1.0,I put it on and barely had in on for a hour and it broke the little metal piece fell out and my watch was just jangling there I’m lucky it didn’t fall off my wrist or I would have a broken Apple Watch do not buy this it is very cheap and very bad quality
1.0,These were a pair I saved under my list and when I purchased I really didn't double check if they were a different pair from lespec that I had saved and oh how I wish they were. I wasted like 80 bucks and I'm not one that can be bothered with returns. They have a thick frame around the lenses and are extra cat eye just feel silly in them but to each they're own
1.0,"They were ok, a bit chincier than expected"
1.0,Charm came off the necklace on the second day.
1.0,Nice sunglasses for Youth Child size not for an adult face.
1.0,The spring broke
1.0,This garment tore when I tried it on.  Very cheap fabric
1.0,"The reviews didn’t help me find a quality product. My package was missing one light colored stocking and one black stocking has a like colored string sewn across the top of the foot, then one black had runs in it before it was worn, and after one wash another stocking ripped across the top. In one wearing, I’m out 3 of 10 stockings with one more defected. Not quality controlled."
1.0,"Purchased this item as a main item for a Christmas present. The shirt came in a bag with the tassels looped thru two completely unaligned holes. The tasss are super thick and not easy to put into the holes. After an hour, I could not do it. If they were already put onto the shirt as the picture design shows, then I would have loved it. The tassels are lose and will fray easily. Btw, the shirt is a dirty black color. It's not dark blue or black as the images show. Disappointed."
1.0,"Looked great and size was right but the button were bad, when you went to open it the button would come off. Completely out of the fabric. Sent this back twice before giving up on it."
1.0,"Cheaply made, don't waste your money hard to see the time hands.  Arrived broken very disappointing. Picture looks nice but when you got it in your hands totally different story. Look elsewhere."
1.0,Not nearly as nice as it looked on the pictures. It fit very boxy.
1.0,picture makes it look larger and more visibly detailed.
1.0,The item says earrings and necklace. I only got the earrings.
1.0,The zipper is cheap and makes the dress look cheaper than it should. Had this dress been made with a narrower and hidden zipper it would’ve been far more appealing. I sent it back
1.0,"NOT A FACE SHIELD!  It's a WRINKLE UP rain hat.  Buy the ""Face Shield"" one.  The pink ""V by Vye"" is horrible too."
1.0,"I read reviews on these before buying and all sounded positive so I bought a pair for my son.  The first time he wore them the side of the frame broke.  He found the part, reattached and it broke again the next week.  I contacted Hodgson and am hoping we got a bad pair and another one will be better but only time will tell."
1.0,The tint on the glasses faded after 6 months.
1.0,"Ordered the 203-stone color in size 46.  Image on this site looks like a dark Grey color. Arrived and it is actually a light khaki color, WAY different than the picture (See comparison below).  Fits as expected waist-wise but the length is ridiculously long, halfway down my calves! At that point they're Capri shorts. Not at all what I expected, and not at all what it looks like in the pictures. Returning these and getting the Lee Dungarees Wyoming Cargo Shorts instead."
1.0,The inside of the dress is white so when it swishes you see it. It looks cheap. I have a gut and love handles and this dress does nothing to hide it.
1.0,Material beginning to fray after a single use + loose threads everywhere.<br /><br />You get what you pay for I guess? I define quality by the longevity and care put into manufacturing.<br /><br />If you’re serious about having accessories - spend more money than this. I’m in the menswear industry and bought these really to see if they stand up to real squares and they do not.
1.0,very very very poor quality! l
1.0,These shoes get lots of compliments on how nice they look but have cracked all over leaving the outside to peel.  The zipper also broke after the first wear.  I contacted the company but they have not gotten back to me!  Super disapointed!
1.0,I ordered 2 sets of these and both are unusable.  Glass is very blurry.  I ordered other glasses of the same strength which were fine so I know the strength I chose is correct.  Too bad because they are cute and perfect for tucking into small places.
1.0,Terrible. Couldn’t even wear these for a minute without having to scratch at it. They tarnish as well.
1.0,I only got one slipper ordered the 4 pack! Scam
1.0,The lace at the bottom was not sewn good and it looked like it would come apart when washed. I returned the dress
1.0,"I usually like Spikerking.  These socks arrived and the hem across the top (by the ankle) all come undon after washing.  Additionally some have holes on the bottom like they were cut.  I sent an email on Wednesday, but haven’t heard back.  Not impressed"
1.0,It was too small in the middle and too large at the top.
1.0,larger than expected . order a size down. dress color looks faded .
1.0,don't bother
1.0,Needed it for my graduation was delayed for several days and wasn’t here on time. At all. The product is good tho
1.0,"Pants fit loose, but are much too short. Material is of poor quality."
1.0,After a few washings the neck started stretching and very noticeable. She won’t wear them.
1.0,"I was looking for a swing dress like Old Navy usually has, and came across this. I was tempted to return it when it came but I thought maybe i should give it a chance. I'm not too happy with the fabric.... It's quite thin and nowhere like the Old Navy ones. When u wear the Old Navy swing dresses, they don't show too much of my ""rolls"" and it's flattering. This one on the other hand, shows every little dent and it's kinda ugly. I wear these casually so I don't want to have to wear a slimmer under it to smoothen my shape. Now that I've worn it i probably can't return it. If you're slim then I'm sure it'll be ok (still thin weak fabric)"
1.0,Itchy. Hot.
1.0,Doesn’t stick well.
1.0,Doesn't fit to size
1.0,This is why I like to wait to write reviews. Only had these about 5 weeks and they have become thin and one has even ripped. I purchased the dark colors and they have only been washed in cold water.
1.0,This is what happens when you don't read the reviews.  It's unfortunate though because this was meant to replace the exact same item that had lasted a good 6 months at least.  Not sure why the quality dipped.
1.0,"Thin cheap fabric breathable but see through<br />Not flattering<br />Some parts too big some too small<br />Unsure what to do with the winged out fabric near armpit areas unable to return<br />Going in the Trash or donating<br />The bust and waist are not proportionate, the bust near armpits flare and it goes in at waste, not most flattering fitting, also fabric is very thin and cheap"
1.0,"As previous customer stated, the quality of the string is poor.  For all the care with packaging, I opened it up and the necklace was already broken and can't really be restrung.  I have a friend who does jewelry making and I'll hand it over to her.  Not worth the price of shipping back to get refund.  Pretty much what you can expect for price paid, but had hoped to get some wearing out of it."
1.0,Not for me..
1.0,El material es sintético y la piel no la encuentro
1.0,Complete crap...I bought these for my daughter for her birthday this year and after the first time of her wearing them the diamonds starting falling out!!! Would highly NOT recommend these. It’s a shame I buy birthday presents early and now it’s to late to return them to Amazon 😡
1.0,the dress was comfy but the bra area was bigger then needed and had extra fabric bunched up it looked weird so i returned
1.0,I ordered these because the picture makes it out to be the whole shoelace is covered in the holographic color but is in fact only a small strip through the center of the shoelace. I purchased the same ones (per the picture) from Wish yrs ago and got what was actually pictured so I figured I'd purchase these so I don't have to wait as long and they were the same price. The ones I purchased from Wish were actually 10x better and were flat shoelaces making it easier to lace and looked 10x better as well.
1.0,"Whole things were bent, cheap quality and can't even put my hand in."
1.0,Zipper came off track within 2 weeks. The bag itself is thin and sturdy to carry notebook.
1.0,These socks won't stay on my heels as I walk. I had to pitch these and buy another brand.
1.0,I didn’t like anything about the pants. They look horrible. Nothing like in the picture and they fit really bad. The inside of the pants is very thick and itchy fleece. Worst buy!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!
1.0,I wear a size 10 and ordered a large... the bodice was so short it didn't come up to my chest!
1.0,I'm not pregnant  yet so idk what else to say
1.0,I thought these were going to be a great fit but I was wrong. These are either way to small or my hands are way to big.
1.0,Earrings look beautiful but are so heavy that they are not practical to wear beyond a short period of time.
1.0,What are the 2 XL and it came more like a medium
1.0,This item does not run true to size. I wear a size 10 and what I received would not fit a size 6. Very disappointed!!!
1.0,Didn't do a whole lot for me - if you have super loose skin it might help tuck you in. But I was hoping to slim my waist a bit for under a suit. It stretches enough that although it's snug I have the same shape around the waist and stomach
1.0,Doesn’t look at all like the picture. I ordered an XL and it looks like it would fit a child...<br />Awful
1.0,Too small. Way too small. I wear a size large or a 12. I couldn't get these over my hips. Very upsetting. Am ordering up 2 sizes to an xxl hopefully they will fit. I'll wait a few days and come back to review the xxl size.
1.0,Very cheaply made and looks nothing like the photo. I returned it.
1.0,I have two of the same exact dresses from this line and they fit exactly as expected. This one was about two sizes too small and fits my 11 year old daughter. Very disappointed.
1.0,My earrings broke in half in less than a month
1.0,"Purchased for a vacation. Fit fine the first time. Thin material, felt cheap but looked OK on the beach. Completely shrunk to half the size after the first wash and dry. There are better tank top brands here on Amazon. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,They're a nice set but very small .. and the hoop ones don't even open? And when I finally got the ball with PLIERS out I couldn't even bend the ring to put it in my nose. I wouldn't waste my money if I knew
1.0,"Leather wasn't sewn all way around,returned for another brand,love it"
1.0,I had 5 friends try on this dress before we figured out that this &#34;3x&#34; dress was actually a size 12 and it had a weird fit on the friend who could finally put it on. It was returned and I will never buy again.
1.0,Nope. Cheap and ill fitting around your nose.
1.0,"Beware these are extremely see through. If you plan to wear them, use a long tunic or long cardigan to cover up your bum. Working out in these was so embarrassing."
1.0,"A pesar de ser original , se ven de una calidad inferior. No lleno mis expectativas."
1.0,This is a keychain with Grogu on it and it says Yoda is my spirit animal! Terrible
1.0,Maybe would fit a 10 year old
1.0,"It's cheaply made, very thin fabric, not how it looks on a picture. Stitch on a back pokes and no ironing could put it down. Doesn't get ironed well either not matter what I do.<br />I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,I ordered an XL based on reviews. I'm generally a size 14 and this &#34;nightgown &#34; fits like it is a small! Very disappointed.
1.0,They were already rusted when I got them
1.0,"“Hanes” wasn’t on tag anywhere; question if it was poor quality knock- off? The bra offered absolutely no support, very disappointed."
1.0,Huge tacky
1.0,I waited so long for this to come in and was so ex tied to use it. I spent 30 min trying to get the claws to hold onto the fabric cup to insert into my sports bras.  The fabric kept unrolling no matter how hard I squeezed it. I ended up just rolling the fabric cup up and stuffing it in the sports bra with my fingers. Not worth the money or the time trying to get it to work. Maybe if it wasn’t made out of cheap plastic it might work.
1.0,"I was very excited about the delivery of these shoes.  I normally wear a size 10 and bought a 10 1/2 based on reviews. When the shoe arrived,it looked so good and I admired the platform in front, however when I tried it on it was small and super hard.  I had to return it; unfortunately it looked good but was such a bad fit for me. I do not know why the fit/size would be so off base and why any shoe that looked so pretty would be made so hard for human feet."
1.0,"This Product doesn't even deserve a 1 start, I am so upset with the product, I purchase this as a gift for my dad and it's so disappointing the product is not leather... it looks like it but when you actually have it on hand is like having does cheap wallets they sale saying is leather. It's not worth it I am sorry."
1.0,"Know this in advance. Very soft material, extremely comfortable, just like spandex. It’s nice and feed it, but if you don’t have already a nice body this will not help you shape or retain the love handles or the belly. It’s more like her favorite shirt nor a shaping shirt."
1.0,"I was super excited to get this shirt in, ordered a size larger(3X) just to be sure it fit....boy was I wrong! This shirt fit my 140lb 5'4"" teenage daughter PERFECTLY. There is NO WAY it was a size 3X like the tag said"
1.0,Shoe was cute but narrow
1.0,Dress is very pretty but too long and the zipper broke taking the dress off
1.0,"If you want to look like Elton John, purchase these sunglasses. Very over the top."
1.0,"This purse looked WAY better on the computer screen. It doesn't look that appealing in real time.<br />Also, had I known it would've smelled so bad I would NOT have gotten it.  It has been almost 4 weeks since I've had it and it still smells. I understand it's fake leather but I've never smelled fake leather like this. Ugh! That's all I am going to say about it."
1.0,The nose ring was flimsy and missing one of the jewel flower petals.
1.0,"What a huge dissapoitment. This is not at all the bag that is in the pictures. It is a huge Tote, not to be confused with the satchel it is listed as.<br />Don't be fooled by the pictures!!! Its a very nice Tote... But that is not what i ordered......what a shame..."
1.0,Cute tankini but the cups where hard and stiff. Uncomfortable.  Can remove but I only wear with cups in place.
1.0,I mainly bought them for the black one but it's clicker was too long the silver one didn't have a place for the clicker and I could only wear the gold. Very dissatisfied and will not go through the inconvenience of sending these back espafter I've contacted them. I won't do business w them again.
1.0,Broke the 3rd time I used it from the wind.
1.0,It's a henle and the pink looks like tan and very cheap.
1.0,"very poor fabric, taught me a lesson"
1.0,Not happy not a 2x. More like a size small.
1.0,"Extremely see through but the print was pretty, I decided to keep it for the beach instead!"
1.0,Broke in one day. Material is cheapest of the cheap.
1.0,"These looked nice, BUT they broke after one week when I took them off too hard.  This is a very, very cheap product."
1.0,Amazingly I have found every time it has fallen off.  Needs to be made with a solid ring that connects to the main bracelet.
1.0,Had to close the pockets because they comes out
1.0,"This material didn't stay up on my daughters face while out in public. Had to keep pulling it up over her nose as the elastic on the top was non-existent. Spent more time touching her face trying to keep this up then just using a traditional mask. Returned this for a refund. Good idea, just not effective for us."
1.0,"This is very cheaply made, not worth the price, DONT BUY"
1.0,Fit a little larger than expected and the pocket zipper broke after about a month of light use. Overall I expected more from HH rain gear.
1.0,Doesn’t specify this specific one size large is for a toddler
1.0,I hated the material.  It looks better in the add.
1.0,"This is a picture of glitter, screen printed on fabric. It’s absolute trash."
1.0,The back light only lights a small portion of the watch and makes it unreadable.  I have had the watch for an hour and it is  23 minutes slow.  Came in a biggish box with no packing.<br /><br />plr
1.0,"I was really excited about this dress, however, the waist is Empire cut, so the skirt goes out straight under the breasts. Makes one look pregnant, also, the skirt length is very short as well, it comes to a very unflattering length, right above the ankles. I do not have large breasts, by the way, so the medium is not recommended for those with a B or higher cup. I am just 5'2&#34; so I would think the length would at least brush the floor.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I wanted to love this dress. I wasn't thinking and too the tags ff already so I am not sure if I will be able to return."
1.0,cheap very thin sweater. Elbows wore through in no time.
1.0,"Bought this for my children to use at lunchtime to sit on outside. I needed TWO, but apparently this is only 2-sided. Don’t be fooled like I was. Would have never spent this much if I knew it was only for one item. Very disappointed."
1.0,Bought it 3 times already looks good but breaks spins
1.0,I usually don’t have good luck buying clothes online. But I gave it a shot. The shorts arrived and they were WAY too big! Both of my legs fit in one of the leg holes. I usually wear a size 0. I would not recommend these to any petite girls out there!
1.0,Kept breaking 😢
1.0,Must get two sizes bigger... way to small<br />Fabric itchy and thin
1.0,Cheap I could get these for a buck and the clasp broke . Big nice size if they hadn't broke I probably would if wore them for my party only
1.0,Looks okay. Didn't last more than one day.
1.0,"when I received this necklace, I thought it looked more antique or rustic but it was simply plastic and cheap looking,  I think I might give it to my little dog. 1 star"
1.0,I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL CHEAP MATERIAL IS NOT LIKE IT THE ONE THEY SHOW I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.....CRAP
1.0,The suit is extremely revealing. There’s not near as much fabric as shown. I left it as a spare (that will require a tank top) at the vacation home.
1.0,Bought this for my wife and she didn’t like this at all - I’m going to return it.
1.0,Red jacket strips have came off after one wash.  So sad they are very cute. Only warranted for 30 days!!!
1.0,Way to small and very flimsy material. not recommended for the money.
1.0,I was trying to find a more affordable alternative to my beloved Targert Gilligan & O'Malley Seamless Boyshorts. These were NOT it... Nothing special. VERY see through. I have a tattoo down my side which was clearly visible through the light colors. These rolled at the thigh and were pretty much useless overall. I do not recommend.
1.0,XL in China and XL in the US are two vastly differently definitions.  This shirt is more Medium than an XL.  The fabric feels cheap.  The description said linen but this shirt is NOT linen.  It feels like 100% polyester but the label says polyester/cotton.  I would definitely NOT recommend.  False advertising.
1.0,This is NOT the authentic Kate Spade crossbody! Do not buy!
1.0,"Nice hat but it’s not adjustable. They call it one size, which is completely accurate. It comes in one size, HUGE!!!!!, and does not have any kind of adjustable strap at the back or pull strings inside. If you need a hat to fit over a football helmet, this would be perfect but if you have a normal size head, this sucker probably won’t work."
1.0,Lo tuve q devolver es muy pequeño
1.0,This luggage does not hold up. I know airports are rough but look at &quot;paint&quot; these are so cheaply made.<br />I would never have bought this set knowing its not durable. Thus us only after one use on a domestic flight. Such a rip off!
1.0,".. because this bra is absolute CRAP. It is so unbelievably unacceptable that as I'm getting ready for a dinner party, wearing this bra, I am taking the time out to write a review on how poor this is.<br /><br />Firstly and most importantly, this thing just DOES NOT WORK. If you so much as need to adjust one time, forget it. This bra is done. I would say it's a one-time use product, but it's not even that. I'd say it's a half-time use product because it only stays in place for about 5-10 minutes before moving around and sweating etc makes the bra peel right off on the edges. It's embarrassing because as I move, I can HEAR the sticky liner peeling off my skin. The cleavage does NOT stay in both left/right directions and in up/down directions. It simply does NOT work and I can't even describe how disappointed and upset I am with the time and money I've wasted on this product.<br /><br />Secondly, the quality of the product I received is just gross. I gave it benefit of the doubt that the little black fuzzies that were stuck between the plastic protective liner and the sticky adhesive liner (see photo) are from during production and warehousing, but the fact it's even there makes me wonder.<br /><br />I wish I could give this product a hundred 1 stars to make up for the several fake reviews I didn't bother to dive deeper into when I was purchasing this. Seriously, it can't be real for 57392937493 &#34;John&#34;s reviewing this product in poor English saying this bra is great because it stays on.."
1.0,Zipper came off when trying it on bad
1.0,You cannot set this watch to the correct time. Using the instructions is an act of futility. Tried reading them Spanish and German also...nope.
1.0,I can’t imagine a body this bra would fit.  It’s not very soft. Kinda scratchy.  The front gaps away because of the overly thick padding.
1.0,"Cheap, definitely not worth more than $2.00 save your money. Very disappointed. 😞"
1.0,Poor quality came broke
1.0,Nice looking glasses but the foam was cheap ...looked like is was just slapped on with some glue. Would definately not keep the wind out. many gaps. Disappoointed. Recieved them yesterday and returning them today.
1.0,"Absolute JUNK ‼️Wore 2 days, large hand off ...."
1.0,This bra like thing was horrible and the glue was coming off the item itself. I need to seed it back. I was not impressed.
1.0,These are thick stickers. They do not adhere better with top coat! Edges are still visible after the top coat. These are a complete waste of time and money.
1.0,Trash
1.0,These are decent quality but don't really adjust to accommodate different sizes. Not sure who they would actually work for if you can't adjust them.
1.0,Too tight on the legs need more room to breath
1.0,It's not a bad chain it's just that it's too small
1.0,These unscrew and fall out reliably.  I swallowed three of the four.
1.0,horrible!!!! came all cricked
1.0,"I had the hoodie for a week. And when I wore it out the pocket ripped  on the side, the stitching."
1.0,Only lasted a few weeks then it began to fall apart. Not well made.
1.0,Size up. Swimsuit runs small. My usual size was short in the torso barely covering the girls.
1.0,"Fake fake fake, what a joke, first of all its a weak silk screen thats all crooked and fake. The hat quality is also garbage. Just buy the real thing this went straight to the garbage."
1.0,The rubber bends that supposed to keep shoes on place are too tight. After i removed them the slippers do not stay on place due to the shallow backs.
1.0,Fell apart on my daughters arm first day!!!<br />WOULD GIVE ZERO STARs if possible but if I don't click a star will not take review
1.0,They run small and the cheap material. The pants doesn’t fit right .. so uncomfortable.
1.0,The product does not actually tell time.it us just the face of a clock on a key chain. It doesn’t keep time
1.0,Disappointed in these. My twins are a size 6-7 in everything so I got a 7 and they are tiny. Now I have to hope we can find boots in time for our snow trip!
1.0,The junk I received looks absolutely nothing like what I thought I ordered. I have seen better jewelry come out of a gumball machine! I took a gamble based on some of the other reviews and I definitely lost this round. Don't even waste your time thinking about ordering this. I would have been ok if it actually looked somewhat like the pictures but this is tiny and nothing like what was advertised.
1.0,"After only two times wearing these cufflinks, the letter fell. A piece of junk not worth 20 cents."
1.0,just didn't fix right
1.0,There is a hole in the leg at the seem. I can't wear them unless I pay for them to get altered. They leg width fits nothing like leggings should. I DO NOT recommend this product.
1.0,The flowers fell off when I opened it and the antlers are super cheap foam.
1.0,There is no way these are sized correctly. They run very small. I will be returning this.
1.0,"Item size is not specified. Bought for my 4 month old and it is WAY too big. Quality of crown was terrible; pieces unglued, Pom poms not fully attached. If sizing option was better and crown was more fitting I would have loved this."
1.0,It too us 20mins to get the plastic wrap off the bracelet.
1.0,"Not a towel by any stretch of the imagination, even though it says towel in the description."
1.0,I hate this shirt. The material is just weird and the knot doesn't hang right and makes your belly look pregnant. I hate it.  I missed return by one day.
1.0,"I would have given -0- stars but can't!  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED<br />Definitely not what you think you're getting! The V neck is off center, the sleeves were 3/4 not long, and seemed to be like a belly shirt. Material is not like a hoodie sweatshirt, it's a cheap material.<br />Don't waste your money....."
1.0,"Realy pretty. But complete junk. Broke almost immediately, made very poorly. Too bad because the actual bracelet is pretty cute. Just cheap quality."
1.0,"Very nice fit, it came with a very big hole in it. Very upsetting because I had to pay to fix it. But overall it’s a nice dress. I only give one star because of the hole."
1.0,Arrived with both stones out. Total junk. Returning
1.0,Fabric/Pattern and Color not as expected!
1.0,"very small, not able to fit around my small/average ankles!  I gave it AWAY to a 9 year old child....."
1.0,The small is for the size of a 10 year old
1.0,I did not buy this watch.
1.0,"It is bad material, after the first wash there will be lint balls all over it"
1.0,DON'T BUY A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. IT SAID IT WAS $99.00. I GOT IT ON SALE FOR UNDER $10-20 I CAN'T REMEMBER. THE ONLY GOOD THING IN IT WAS THE TRAVEL TUMBLE MY DAUGHTER USES IT DAILY FOR COFFEE. THE BOX IS CUTE TOO. BUT MINE WAS CRUSHED.
1.0,Way to small then the claimed size.
1.0,These are very small and seem to be made from old handset cords. I know no one buys phones with cords anymore so I guess they found a way to repurpose them.  Not the best decision.
1.0,Product was tarnished and old looking. I was very dissatisfied with this item. I’m returning it for a full refund.
1.0,So little omg! Not pleased at all
1.0,The catch on the wrist band kept opening and I almost lost the watch a few times.  Returned it.  Nice looking but didn't work for me.
1.0,Highly dissatisfied- deep scratches in both lenses
1.0,The screw on one of the parts that folds came out after wearing them for 5 minutes and were unable to be put back together.
1.0,"This is a night gown.  By no means a dress top wear out in public.  It's see thru.  It looks pretty,  but the material could be better."
1.0,Very very cheaply made and just completely see through.
1.0,Too small & company not willing to exchange
1.0,Nunca recibí el pedido
1.0,"Waste of money, it broke while trying to put it on, it isn't what I saw under the description  ."
1.0,AFTER WAITTING ALMOST FIVE WEEKS FOR DILIVERY AND IT FINALLY ARRIVES .THE ENTIRE FRAME IS TWISTED I HONESTLY REGRET PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT .RIGHT NOW I WISH I COULD AFFORD TO SHIP IT BACK.
1.0,"Don’t waste your money.  Impossible to focus accurately, flimsy, visual field is narrow, limited peripheral vision with smeared blurs on either side.  Its like looking through old time bullet glass windows."
1.0,Terrible fit. Returned.
1.0,I love this ring but unfortunately it didn't fit. The description said fits most and will expand but my size 10 finger won't fit into it even though it says it'll fit a 9.5<br />Pretty disappointing. If you have smaller fingers I imagine it would be great.
1.0,Color okay just a little cheap however I needed a white bag
1.0,"Only 4 bands received, missing the orange and yellow ones! Please send these missing ones!!!"
1.0,The bottom part came off and the color didn’t look like the one described in the picture. Bad quality so I returned.
1.0,This was the worse that I have purchased . It is over sized. The top of head puffs up and even when you lower it it does not stay there are no strings to make it smaller to fit<br />It’s terrible don’t buy this one
1.0,Ordered a xl when they arrived it had a 22&#34; waist. To rtn was going to cost nearly as much as cost if pants. When ordering make sure to check where garment is coming from.
1.0,"Looked good out of the bag.  After the first wash (cold) they all looked like wrinkled dish rags.  Shouldn't have to iron for ten minutes to make them wearable.  Made the mistake of buying three.  Had I bought only one, I would have saved money and frustration.  Lesson learned."
1.0,"This product is mis-sized. It is way to small, the size label are NOT CORRECT. If you are larger size (over 38 c or d) it will not fit you. The company need to re-label it's sizing."
1.0,"Super disappointed!,, poorly put together ... cheap and will never use it"
1.0,I only received 1 pajama not two
1.0,This is made VERY cheap. I feel it looks like a polyester clown suit. So disappointed...<br />It looks so much better in the image.
1.0,The cover is too long and covers a lot of my key. And the the chain that is meant to hold the key in the cover and keep the cover on your keychain opens fairly easy. My key feel off multiple times just sitting in my pocket.
1.0,The sizing is a joke. I have one of these in XL and know how big it is. Bigger enough to put over the index finger of a heavy stick glove. This thing is smaller than the normal small size. The material is also very thin.
1.0,very small coat
1.0,Really cute but fell apart after the first time I wore it out! For the price I think was only a one time shirt :(
1.0,This is not as pictured.  Very small and thin fabric.  Very disappointed with product.
1.0,Garbage...
1.0,"Looks like a girl's blouse. Not the same neckline as advertised, plus it's crooked. Buttons are decorative, not functional."
1.0,"It actually deserves zero stars. Cheap. Flimsy material. Not worth the price. Requested to return it, and was told to keep it, but they would refund my money. They did. It says something when they refund your money and they don’t want the product back."
1.0,Cheap poor quality watch looks stylish but once I open the box I immediately said to myself this is going back. I would highly recommend looking into Invicta watches better quality more stylish options and they’re inexpensive but don’t look cheap.
1.0,More like a robe for bedtime than something yo wear out of the house
1.0,It looked  nothing like the picture. Material was super thin.
1.0,Itchy material lose not what I expected ! Sent it back ! Was to use for my wedding reception. Had to run to David’s bridal and spend way more on something else
1.0,Awful!!! Bought this with the idea it was adjustable...it isn't! Too bad because I love the way it looks- just can't wear it because its too big.
1.0,First time using it after unsnapping it fell apart not worth it unless it comes with extra belt loops
1.0,Different grey color
1.0,There is no compression at all.  Just fits like regular t-shirt.  The length is a little short for my taste.  I will keep just to wear working in yard.  Will not order again.  I ordered size small
1.0,It was uncomfortable
1.0,"The product is cute but it's made so cheap that it's like something from the store $5 and below.  It stunk like chemicals when I opened the package, and you can tell it will shrink as soon as it's washed and the fabric will shred.  I would not recommend this item."
1.0,This was insanely too long.
1.0,Did not fit like it was pictured at all
1.0,Humans are not costumes. This is EXACTLY the same as BLACKFACE.
1.0,This product was very cheap. The anchor is broke and the gold finish wore off after 1 day of wearing it
1.0,"I ordered these and had hoped they'd be made of a fairly decent quality, but they're not. When you open the packaging, you immediately realize that they are cheaply made. The &#34;gold trim,&#34; was very plasticky, as well as the rest of the glasses. I wasn't expecting $80 quality..just better than $4 quality. Am returning them, as they don't look very nice. If you're looking for something to wear with some sort of a costume...these would work..other than that...useless."
1.0,Doesn’t look anything like picture. Sides are super short.. Material is cheap
1.0,Looks nice in the picture. Poor quality. See through. Bad cut.
1.0,This is a beautiful dress but the fabric is very thin and see-through.
1.0,Necklace came in broken & missing one of the pieces in between the blue stones.
1.0,Way too tight. Not flattering at all.
1.0,It is comfortable. That is about it. The thin blue line is too dark to even notice under most lighting conditions.
1.0,"This black and white poncho was a really bad knock off of what is pictured. It had sleeves and clearly there are no sleeves in the picture. The cuffs on the sleeves were black with a white stripe. If you lift your arms at all, the bottom raises up to chest area. Very awkward design and not what is advertised. Total waste of money. The material was bulky and so cheap. Metallic lines on it. It laid weird because the “yarn” was so stiff, cheap and bulky. The collar was very different as well. Stay away from this one. You’ll thank me. Worst purchase ever from Amazon. I usually really like my purchases. This was over the top bad."
1.0,Tie fell apart
1.0,"I loved it when I received it and I took it off when i got home every day and placed in its jewelry box but a month into it one of the link broke, thank God i was at my work desk when it happened. Try to get to seller cause 2 nd replacement broke with a month of getting it, they wouldn’t refund my $40 I paid for this cheap material Very disastisfied, will never purchase from here."
1.0,Not for XBOX One
1.0,"Es de pésima calidad, dicen ser resistentes pero es mentira"
1.0,Not the same color as pictured. Disappointed because I do not like the one I received and will never wear it.
1.0,Wallet strap broke right off after a week of use
1.0,"Very cheaply made, your fingers will go right through them."
1.0,This didn't work at all!!! It doesn't stay on. Waste of money
1.0,"Arrived busted, and much smaller than it appeared online. Disappointed 👎"
1.0,they shrink easily
1.0,"WARNING !!! TOTALLY JUNK!!! OVER priced cheap flea market garbage, rough material. so don't let that one picture and other fake paid trolls temp you with it. you will have to pay for the return charges and lazy Amazon employees like jennifer H from W. Virgina and Liars like Robert from Kentucky can't do a thing for you but to shut you out like you owe them money."
1.0,This was shipped to me broken. Bad quality jewelry.
1.0,"Second pair, I purchased this time I got a large and it's still too small. I'm usually a medium. Not happy with how they look on."
1.0,"Received the hoodie, it is lightweight, ordered large didnt fit daughter who's a ladies medium, too small. Decal on front, yes andrcal, the wings were pressed folded over."
1.0,I was so exited to receive this dress as photos look externally flattering and the few reviews it does have appeared to be pleasant. I Am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The material is paper thin and completely see-through. I do not recommend buying this dress. :(
1.0,Not true to its word disappointed in shoe returning them
1.0,"Hard to get your racket in and out and the inside dark, deep pocket is too small. Replaced it already with a &#34;real&#34; tennis bag."
1.0,No instructions on how to use
1.0,This sweater came in a dirty package. after opening it and taking the sweater out it looked used the color was faded. It was also had a odor.
1.0,"The top is only half as long as it looks in picture.  The waist is size of xxS or for child.  The tag is in some oriental language so you can't see what they even sent you.  I just returned 4 sets of pajamas I purchased either because the top and bottom were a mismatch or the sizing was for very small people.  I wont trust the reviews anymore, at least for clothing."
1.0,"My large piece of luggage broke the first time I used it on a flight in February.  The right wheel totally broke off !!  Taking part of the bottom with it.  I had to drag it across the airport to get to my Uber.  I threw it away when I unpacked the next day.  The smaller one cracked across the top so it won't last another trip.  I have never bought luggage that broke so easily.  I have pieces of luggage that are just old but are not broken, not even the wheels."
1.0,I have the side of my nose pierced and it was too small :/
1.0,"Only came with the cap and booties. No onesie. Cheap material, don't waste your time"
1.0,I expected this item to be an Alex and Ani bracelet and it was not!  Highly disappointed!
1.0,When I first got the product it worked fine but 2 days later & everything fell apart. :(
1.0,Turned my finger colored
1.0,On the gray and white check scarf the weaving is messed up with a big clump of white when it was woven! I have 2 more different colors checked scarfs that I haven't opened yet because I was really upset.  I've thought of ways to try and hide the big white mess up but there's no way I can!
1.0,"One of these bags broke with two gaping holes in it during its very first use.  These may resemble the wonderful green Grab Bags as seen on TV, but the quality here is about as low as you can imagine. Stay away!"
1.0,No way these are $20 quality - more like $3-5 range.  Returned ASAP
1.0,"this is a horrible product, tarnished and turned green/black after I wore it once. Does not look like the picture at all. Much bulkier and much more low quality."
1.0,"Strange hem at the bottom made it fitted, with no stretchable material.  The rest of the dress had give, except the bottom.  So weird.  Returned immediately."
1.0,The necklace is very beautiful but I only wore it twice since I brought it and one of the charms turned silver. So I cannot wear it anymore. But hey you get what you pay for right.
1.0,It's great fabric. And love just need little more fabric
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Image distorted and red splotches on mask.
1.0,"These are so cheap and fake looking , u get what u pay for ! So disappointed !"
1.0,Top is waaay too small. I asked for a larger size and no one would get back to me. Bottoms are true to size but definitely not the top.
1.0,Material is terrible and no tags at all to show cleaning instructions or material type
1.0,"These masks turned out to be a waste of money. I could barely breathe with these on. Totally suffocating. They fit loosely, too. I'm not the type to write these reviews, but this was disappointing enough to do just that."
1.0,I got one bracelet! Not happy at all!
1.0,"So sad... I LOVE this shirt. So much so that I was about to order another after I tried it on. Unfortunately, it went from $17.99 to $18.99 within 2 days. So this is not that big of a difference of course, but I did not buy another one because this has happened to me several times now. I guess  they watch your patterns with the algorithms, and will price gouge when possible. I’m not sure when this started or why, but I guess they want to squeeze every penny from everyone they can. I won’t be ordering another one unless the price is like down, just out of principle."
1.0,"I purchased the band on August 20, 2016 for $16.24. Slightly over a year later the band cracked and right now i am looking for a replacement. Exactly the same problem happened with the original band. So, you pay $16 for something that lasts slightly over a year. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.<br /><br />Note that many other positive reviews were left when the band was received, not after it had been used for a long time.<br />I purchased it from The Watchband Store (not that its their fault)."
1.0,"Ordered a 0 gauge, product is labeled 0 garage. Actually a 2 gauge.  Not even close to correct sizing."
1.0,Small and see through.
1.0,"We are returning this item. We ordered a 38R and received a 42, and while the pants say 32, they appeared to be closer to a 36 or 38 when my husband tried them on. Very disappointing. The tag on the tuxedo jacket also said made in china at the top rather than Calvin Klein or anything (not sure if this is typical, but it made it seem cheaper). Also, the fabric did not feel like a $600 tux. We were all around very disappointed and had to scramble last minute for our black tie event."
1.0,"The bracelet is plastic, it is not obsidian stone. Save your money."
1.0,I guess it was for too mod for me!
1.0,"The sizes of these shorts are way off.  We had ordered an xs and s, but the xs was more like a medium and the s was more like a large.  I ordered these for my daughter and we are petite people.  Normally xs to s works fine for us, but the xs in these shorts fell right off of her."
1.0,I only wore these twice and then the snap broke off. They won't return or replace after I've only had them for a month.
1.0,I ordered according to the reviews and size chart. I am 5ft 8 and the dress came to the middle of my shins. The material was very thin and was see through.
1.0,The zipper won't stay closed with hardly anything in it and it has a strong odor.
1.0,My husband is tried to band three different times and each time watch has almost fallen off his arm the bands do not stay connected to the watch I paid good money for this product and I’m extremely upset both with Amazon and the company why would you sell something that does not work
1.0,Literally don’t buy this belt unless you’re like a size 6.
1.0,"they  do  not  fit  and  are  too thin,"
1.0,Size too large.  Company does not pay for return or exchange shipping .
1.0,it’s crap and then when I returned at UPS they refused to refund my money. Definitely a time where you would say you get what you pay for-they do not fit at all.
1.0,La tela no es como parece
1.0,Size is very small and it's not the same as described in picture
1.0,Are u kidding me?I didnt get it and you dont answer me!!!Back my money!!or send me again!!!
1.0,Not the same anchor as in the description/pictures.
1.0,"I have had these shorts for about 8 months.  They are falling apart in the band and crotch area.  I don't even use every day for running b/c I have three other pairs that I have had over 3 years and THEY are still PERFECT.<br />These are cheap, do NOT buy.<br />Mike in NC"
1.0,Sizing was correct but bad fit. Horrible quality and fabric.
1.0,"After applying wax on all four wheels (per instructions), I came around to remove and found it extremely difficult.  I had to use WD-40 on my Forged Mugen MF10 wheels to remove the white residue left behind from this wax."
1.0,It was the watch I chose but it didn't work at all.  Probably a bad battery. I returned it and steered away from this brand for choosing a different watch.
1.0,"I've never had a bra do this, but it squeeked when I moved. Like a shoe. Also a strange fit.. too narrow in the front or something. The color was nice."
1.0,This came multi colored and with some kind of spray gel on it. Don’t buy it!
1.0,I really liked this top however the 1st time I wore it! This is what happened! It literally started to unravel right on my body! So bad I ended up having to buy a tee shirt to put on because I was out! Really cute but made so bad!!! Wasted my money😡😡
1.0,In two sets the one was broken
1.0,Do not purchase this item. It doesn't fit at all. False advertising
1.0,"within days of installing the band, it broke, buyer beware."
1.0,So big for me
1.0,Usually a 3x hockey Jersey is loose on me. This must be a classic Chinese 3x. Quality is still pretty good just runs a little small.
1.0,"I wear X large to 1X, however it did not button across the chest, it button at my waist but was tight. I love the length."
1.0,Very poor quality - you can't put them on without creating a run.  The colors are not as pictured.
1.0,Came broken! Very cheap so it probably breaks very easily (you get what you pay for). I returned.
1.0,"I ordered a XL I normally wear a L. It still didn't fit, mainly it was too short to me and the arms were tight.  When ibrequested a return they said they were located in China and they rather I keep it for a friend.. Don't order from sunsent if you want your item to fit right...."
1.0,In my oppinion I think the description of this item and many other should be alittle more clear it looks very cheap and cheesie im not lying it was for a gift and as soon as i opened it alone before boxing it I got embarrised and mad
1.0,"The sizing chart is no good.  They shrink when you wash them.  The material is very thin and sickly.  The drawstring is spliced and very weak.  There is a hole in the pocket from an unsewn seam, shoddy workmanship.  Other than that, they're great &#62;:^("
1.0,"First wear and there was a hole in the mesh and then all the little snag marks showed up. Fit was good, little loose so i never expected the snags and hole. They are also a thin material, no compression at all. Poor quality, very disappointing."
1.0,They seem to be ok as far as comfortability. I have had them two days and they tore from the main part of the slipper from the sole.
1.0,"Poor design, hurts to wear."
1.0,This bag I received does not look like the one in the picture.  The leather looks very cheap and it has an unpleasant smell.  I am returning it.
1.0,"The top zipper broke after two weeks.  I like the purse, not so much now that it's broken.  :("
1.0,"The color is nothing like in the photo, the pockets are nothing like in the photo, cheapy made. Save yourself the trouble and don't order this one."
1.0,Didnt fit my watch
1.0,Not white and the breast cover is thin as in not covering over breast. I'm a 41 wide and it sits between I'm gonna have to sew a thick border on the sides probably ruffle it up on the sleeve too. The back is more open then I thought it would be. Wife talking
1.0,"Product came nicely packaged, but had gaps between the watch and strap right from the beginning and the edges were not smooth along the watch seam. About a week after getting the strap, the hardware that holds it to the watch broke and now it is unusable."
1.0,Get a bigger size than you need.
1.0,"No puedo configurar la hora, la alarma, nada"
1.0,"these are unfortunately of that kind that starts stinking badly after the first wearing, and no washing can wash it out. this is a common issue with synthetic workout clothes, alas I have no idea how to know this in advance."
1.0,"The ring I received is not of any quality at all.  It is not stamped with SPIKE as indicated in the description, and is made of cheap, thin, lightweight metal.  The flower setting appears to be painted black, then with a shiny coating of some sort in an attempt to give a lustrous appearance.  Maybe the flower was bent on one side in shipping, (in it's flimsy minimally protective envelope), or maybe it's supposed to be that way. I have noticed that this ring looks similar to another (unhappy) reviewer's ring from the photo that they posted.  One thing is for certain, and that is neither my nor the other unsatisfied customer's ring look anything like the one depicted in the advertisement photo.  It's not worth the bother or effort  of sending back or doing anything more with it besides tossing it in the the trash. BUYER BEWARE!!"
1.0,"It came missing part, and it is cheap quality."
1.0,"it was ugly and looked cheap. on top of that, it did not fit well and was just about missing the second layer of the dress. ew"
1.0,Just uncomfortable the straps are fragile not with your money.
1.0,"It came open and retaped (poorly), needless to say i didn't let my son eat it since I have no idea how long it had been open or what it was exposed to so I threw it away."
1.0,"Masks are on the smaller side and lining is VERY IRRITATING and ITCHY!!!!  Sadly, can’t be worn and a complete waste of money. Will try another seller."
1.0,Extremely small I even ordered 2 sizes up and it still feels at the most a size 12
1.0,Not acceptable at all. Trying to refund not allowing. Looks terrible and super cheap. Worst item I've gotten on Amazon!
1.0,Mask was separated in areas and the hair was lighter and shorter than what’s displayed in the picture. Overall poor quality
1.0,Would not fit over the rubber ear piece on any of my Oakley’s.
1.0,Broke upon putting in nostril. Poorly made
1.0,The button is broke after he wore them 2 times.
1.0,"This fit tighter than a scuba diving wetsuit. Truly like a second skin in the most uncomfortable and unflattering way. Yes, its cheap..but the quality is cheap-on-steroids. Would probably look super adorable on a petite size 00."
1.0,Does not stay tight on the wrist. Arrived dirty. Had to clean it off before putting it on.
1.0,Very nice until the  zipper broke. Only had it 1 week.
1.0,A liar
1.0,it turn black so it must not be real silver 925 it is stamped even NOT REAL
1.0,It started changing colors on both parts NO I did not shower with it. Just every day wear since we bought them. Makes me so sad because I so loved what they mean to us.
1.0,I ordered this swimsuit in pink for a few vacations I’m taking this month to the beach.  The suit fits great and sizing is true to size. I absolutely love the color.  I know this is what I get for ordering a suit online and waiting till the last minute to wash before wearing.  But it’s a good reminder to ALWAYS wash before wearing.  I pulled this suit out of its package (I tried it on weeks ago when I decided I was keeping it) and took off the sanitary sticker in the bottom crotch area to find a female stain....underneath the sanitary sticker.  I’m absolutely disgusted.  Most likely this item was returned without being inspected before being shipped out again.  I’m very thankful I decided to wash it before packing it in my suitcase.  Will not be ordering from this vendor ever again.
1.0,See though...... like very flimsy material.
1.0,I knew it wasent a top of the line product - but I didn't expect it to break already. Didn't even put a lot of stress on it. Buckle just fell apart as I was walking at work.
1.0,stained
1.0,I hate this item. I’m sorry. It’s cheap. It took forever to get here. I tried to open it for the first time and it won’t even stay open. I think it’s broken.
1.0,They were super cute the first time I wore him I lost one of the end it’s on the airing so nowI only have one and will never wear them again I’m really bummed they were just not put on good enough I guess
1.0,Thread started to unravel after wearing only once. I'm afraid to wash them because they may totally unravel.
1.0,"Had to throw out, it wouldn’t stay up like the picture"
1.0,This dress is too long for me and I’m 6’0 feet tall. It is also VERY thin. I’m going to return it.
1.0,Me gusto mucho el color y el modelo pero no me mandaron el número correcto
1.0,"Item does not match the image shown not even close, color was off, material was off, was not as wide spread as well. Just saying just post what you really have. Because that image of the mustard/yellow is not what I received. As shown in my images the pants are straight not wide."
1.0,Not Sterling Silver as Stated !!!!!
1.0,"Cant use too small, cant return because too short of return date. Poor quality, sizing is not US. No hollow-boned women here!"
1.0,Horrible the cap wasn't as described
1.0,fit my eight year old niece so it was a great birthday gift for her but that was the large
1.0,About 20% leather. It is a nylon strap with a very thin layer of leather attached to it (to make it look completely leather). Nice job by the company to hide this in the photo's as well.<br /><br />One of those things you buy and feel really dumb for falling for afterwards.
1.0,"Horrible, everything abt these pants! I order 2 diff sizes to ensure I would be able to fit at least one pair and either one fit, the bottom popped off one of them before I even tried it own, they came with a horrible smell on them! I couldn’t fit either pair and they looked so cheaply made compared to the picture. I will never order from this company again I might not ever order clothes from amazon again I’m so scared now have 1 star bc I had to at aleast select 1. Wish I could give a negative star"
1.0,It turned to copper or brass or what ever it is after one shower. It also broke within days. It's advertised as Sterling Silver but it's not. And it's from China. It's garbage save your money.
1.0,Too small and not even remotely comfortable at all.  I waited too long to return it and now I can't.  Bummer.
1.0,HUGE!! hate it!
1.0,Way too big. Looks like a hospital scrub shirt. Bad material that isn’t flattering at all.
1.0,This shirt is more wide than long and the neck is wide. Cheap stretchy material .
1.0,Looks cheap - like orange dyed plastic rather than quality leather
1.0,So disappointing! I bought these as parts of Xmas gifts for my nieces but more than half of them don’t work. I would be okay with that if only at least one pair worked! But not a single pair came with two working earrings. What a bummer!!
1.0,This swimming suit looks very cute on picture but when it came it’s completely see through. I also ordered large but it looked like it was extra small super tiny. Needs to be lined. I’m returning it.
1.0,A little too tight and uncomfortable
1.0,Way too small for C or D cup. Am returning!!!
1.0,Poor Quality sunglasses. Seem to be made of cheap plastic. I will be returning these soon.
1.0,The material was awful
1.0,They fit in the waist but we’re very baggy in the front crotch area and long in the crotch
1.0,I was excited to get this item and quickly started using them. At first glance everything looked great and seemed durable. Upon wear the BRIGHT GOLD chain lost its luster with in 2 days of wear. Unfortunately the gold is the only one I've used at this point so I can not add to the other colors but I assume the same will happen for those. Yes they have held up to kid wear (read as durable) but the pendant no longer matches the chain. I would not buy this product again.<br />*one photo is after wear the other is prior to wear.
1.0,This ring looks HEAVILY WORN. I didn’t fully read the description but it does not look like the pictures. Thought I was ordering a clean silver ring but it looks like I just pulled it out from the bottom of a river. If you’re going for the “worn in” look this is totally for you but not what I thought I was ordering.
1.0,Ordered my size. It was way too loose. I didnt like the way it looked on me at all. Returned a week ago and still havnt recieved my refund. I may be contacting amazon soon. But I do not recommend this purchase
1.0,"Got two, two different times and first time came in broken. Second time it broke as we put it on him 🤦🏽‍♀️ Super upset about it cause he loved it and it was perfect size for him he’s 5"
1.0,"The skirt quality was exactly what I expected in terms of weight, warmth, etc. It fit well also. Unfortunately, I wore it twice for less than 5 hours each time and the zipper broke. It wasn't as though the skirt was really tight and I was straining it at all -- it is just poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for, but at ~$17 per wear, this is pretty unacceptable."
1.0,"Doesn’t  stay on, no nose piece to keep it on."
1.0,"Love the color! The right slipper is so wide it won't stay on when I walk, even with socks. The left is loose but at least stays on. I don't have narrow feet so these run really wide!"
1.0,The zipper it's brake in 1 week don't buy it
1.0,I ordered 6 dresses all on Amazon in size medium to wear post partum. They all fit great except this one it’s like an XS.
1.0,This was a waste of time and money.  This band was no where near fitting the device!  very disappointed!!
1.0,Broke the first day...ashes for them to replace it... Months later filled second complaint because still no replacement received.
1.0,I gift it to my granddaughter when she came to stay rhenite she love it
1.0,"This dress is absolutely ridiculous. It feels like costume material and the bottom is just holes cut out of the fabric, it was already fraying right out of the package. It doesn't look anything like what's pictured, I'm sending it right back and not ordering ANYTHING from this seller again."
1.0,I feel stupid for wasting my hard earned money on a piece of moon shaped plastic.☹️ You can see straight through the bottom half.
1.0,Not the greatest quality. Barely worked. Spend the money on higher quality
1.0,Poor quality. Extremely slow shipping. Dress looks nothing like pictures
1.0,Liked the purse by zipper broke in 1st week
1.0,This shirt looked nice the first time I wore it. After one wash and air drying it (I never put my workout shirts in the drier) this shirt got little fuzzes everywhere! Super annoying. Now it has turned into a sleep shirt ahhaha 🤦🏻‍♀️oh well.
1.0,Had to take into a shop to get it put in. I and my sister tried with no luck.
1.0,cheaply made and broke after a day or two... clasp fell off. Horrible product. Don't waste your money... give it to charity instead. This is a horrible product.
1.0,Es muy fea encambio en la foto se ve bonita y no trae el cinturón tampoco
1.0,"Poor quality - misplaced stones, lopsided shape. Returning these today!"
1.0,"So disappointed. I love them when they arrived. Wore them around the house a couple hours. Went to put them on this morning for a run, and so far have noticed 4 slits/holes. When I saw the first I thought well... maybe stitch it. Then found more. They haven’t even been washed. And I was going to order more. Thank goodness I didn’t."
1.0,This doesn’t deserve any stars. Cheap cheap cheap. Looks more like a dollar store bathrobe.
1.0,Band recieved was not what was pictured.
1.0,To big I should have gotten a large instead of the XL I returned it
1.0,I am giving this product a review of one star because after wearing this sock twice I saw my big toe sticking out of my sock. I did contact the company Venice and let them know to which I received no response. I would not recommend these socks since they did not hold up.
1.0,Gems are falling off or missing all together. Plates are off center and one piece is almost falling apart. Very poorly made.
1.0,Item looks nothing like picture.  Very disappointed.
1.0,The image is skewed.
1.0,There is a very strong smell of perfume and it is ripped.. clearly worn
1.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in this purchase. The hat came deformed and stretched, as it if had been hanging from the hook on display but somebody kept pulling on it until they finally decided to sell it on amazon because it was so deformed. It looks weird and I have to fold the top of the hat to prevent the deformity from being seen. I won't purchase from this seller again."
1.0,Shrank in wash.  Too small now.
1.0,"I don't have long or sharp nails, yet the tips of these gloves tear so easily."
1.0,I purchased the shorts to feel comfortable in dresses on hot days. These shorts are very uncomfortable. The fabric feels like it is made with brillo pads.
1.0,the paint wore off and it looked terrible after a short time of having it
1.0,I would like to return it for it keeps stopping and when it is running it gains time. Please send return authorization.
1.0,The hat came all bend up not a good thing
1.0,"It didn't add to my look or to my liking. I think its made for tall people. Im 5'. After I had it hemmed up to my length I still didn't like it. The top its not where it supposed to be..for me. Too big, I think. And I ordered a small."
1.0,No pandora stamp think it's fake
1.0,This was an American size zero and I ordered a large because i figured it would run small.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS OVERPRICED PRODUCT!!!! Download Kroger App and order there.
1.0,"Sadly, this didn't work for me. I'm a S, and I purchased a S, but it was way too big all over. Also the bottom did something weird in the middle where the two colors form a X, but that could also be because the bottom was way too big on me."
1.0,"The finished product doesn’t look no where near good as pictures on here does. The bullet tip wasn’t ever rounded, and looks like a lip stick top"
1.0,I shouldn't have wasted money on this it is terrible I wear a 1 or 2x and I ordered a 3x I could barely get it over my head😠
1.0,"Not sure how it works on other material, but does not work for stainless steel (what I purchased it for)"
1.0,"It runs small and it's straight fit, no wiggle room for kids with hips."
1.0,Really thin flimsy fabric. Fit small. Just not good quality.
1.0,"These look exactly like the (broken) ones I have, and are the correct model advertised for my watch.  These simply do not ""snap on"" to the watch as others I have purchased, so useless to me.  I've had and worn this watch daily for nearly 2 years, so I don know how the units are supposed to lock on."
1.0,"Did not like the way they fit , will b returning"
1.0,Don't purchase pendant came tarnished not real gold
1.0,"Great ! Runs too big , about 2 sizes too big"
1.0,Whole sole separated from the shoe after 3 wears.
1.0,WASTE OF MY MONEY! CHAIN WAS  BROKE VEFORE I TOOK THEM OUT THE PACKAGE! THEY BREAK IF YOU SNEEZE!
1.0,Necklace arrived severely tarnished. Returned it
1.0,There is already a hole in the shirt out of the package. The head hole is very tight getting on and the arms are very loose and lop sided. I do like the length and am hoping it will still work as an undershirt
1.0,A large is tall enough for an adult but really like a size 0.
1.0,Returned not stretch
1.0,crap. the threading on the back doesn't allow to twist back ring on.. so the tunnels dont stay in
1.0,I love the metal and how the Eye is displayed but the leather is so hard it is uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,I bought a 3X but they fit my daughter who is in a size 8.
1.0,"The dress is extremely heavy, sequences fall off easily and too shiny giving the appearance of a cheap outfit.  Fits loose in some areas and tight in others... not a true medium.  Returning, the picture on the site is misleading."
1.0,Terrible quality.<br />Boots were worn only several times and the bottom part unglued from the leather within first 30 days.<br />I am requesting refund.<br />The chemical smell is very offensive and did not air out in the reasonable a out of time.<br /><br />Do not recommend.
1.0,Beautiful band.  Fixed pins are too short.  Outer links fell off in several places.
1.0,"Loved them at first, but the pin came off on one of them after only four or five uses."
1.0,I returned these. I didn’t like the fit and found some others that work better for me!
1.0,Child sized. Poor light. Not worth even the cheap price.
1.0,"95 degrees in Colorado today. Thought I would wear the mask in Walmart. It felt like I was wearing a wool mask over my mouth. I couldn’t breathe well, and my chin started itching. All I wanted to do was rip the mask off. My Walmart trip was mighty quick. Returning these masks."
1.0,No es el color que pedí
1.0,This shirt looks NOTHING like the Tshirt. It looks like a work tshirt with a banded bottom.
1.0,Item was not material it stated & was clearly cheaply made.
1.0,My charm was not in my package
1.0,"Itchy, small, bad quality. Avoid this."
1.0,Not a compression top
1.0,"The white is totally see-thru . I have this dress in black and another in black with white polka dots and this dress is made of a much different, lower quality material. To wear this in public you would need a maxi slip or save it for a beach coverup. Super disappointing. I really liked my other dresses in the same cut."
1.0,"I really liked the look of these earrings but they are too thick for the holes in my ear....I have never had a problem like this before, I could get them through using a vasoline product but they were too uncomfortable to wear."
1.0,"I ordered a 0g, what I got is way bigger, not sure what size, possibly a 00. The gauges themselves are cute, I'm just upset that I can't wear them."
1.0,Es muy largo para mi y incómodo para poder utilizar la cámara. Después de tantos intentos para utilizarlo cómodamente con la cámara no funciona para mi 😣.
1.0,Cute and I like it but it arrived with a dead battery....really??!! What a disappointment
1.0,"I’m not sure if the band I received is defective or was misrepresented in the listing. Instead of the buckle shown in the pictures from the vendor, instead the band I got had two nubs that you’d press the holes over, which would be okay, except they’d already fallen off in the packaging. I cannot get them to stay securely attached to the band, which means my watch won’t stay securely on my wrist. (I uploaded a picture.) I love the pattern, which matches perfectly with my rose gold watch, but the band is useless if it keeps coming apart. I’m so disappointed!"
1.0,"Adorable earrings! But the pins that hold them in the ear we’re all different sizes, and they both fell out of my ear less than an hour.  The manufacturer knew the backs were bad as I was given a back up pair inside the box which I appreciated but unfortunately for gems this heavy, and the metal pin that goes threw your ear was two different sizes.... I cannot in good conscience recommend these earrings. I wore them to a villains event for my Jafar costume, would have given 5 stars if they lasted longer than an hour."
1.0,They dont stay on
1.0,"Larger sized items did not provide the appropriate size increase in inseam, thigh and waist in proportion to the remainder of the garment. Tailor merely added arbitrary fabric rather than keeping tailoring in proportion to style of original garment."
1.0,Had to return item. Short sleeve short in long sleeve package. Poor quality control
1.0,The top for well. The bottom of the dress is an odd length and way too big. Not flattering at all.
1.0,The shape and fit of this is so uncomfortable and not flattering. The material is good. It’s a no from me.
1.0,If you like this dress make sure you size up 2xs more! I am a medium and I ordered a medium. Fit like I was trying on my 6 yr olds dress. Extremely disappointed because I was looking forward to this dress. Definitely will be returning.
1.0,"Its really short but I love it just to have a guess haha I would wear it if it had a decent length and width it could pass as a large rag. It can't look good because it doesn't have the look like on the photo, its not wide enough to look bunched up and pretty"
1.0,"The first pair came broken.  Things happen, I get it.  Unfortunately when the replacement pair came one of the hoops just fell off the first time I wore them.  They didn't even last 5 hours before falling apart.  I just ended up so pissed I threw them away."
1.0,Material is wierd and print is not good
1.0,"The sizes run small, I ordered a size 7 for my cousin and it barely fits on my pointer finger which is a size 6. Hopefully it fits her. The band is also mishapen and extremely thin."
1.0,I couldn't  get them to stay up
1.0,So it said I could wash it so I did and bows came apart and I am very upset about it
1.0,Ugh soooo gross. Completely covered in lint or feathers!  Made in China. Who knows What the heck happened!
1.0,Doesn't look like the pictures. And they are flat when you put them on. Like walking in sox. Poorly made all the way around
1.0,"this bracelet broke as soon as it got onto my wrist. horrible quality, and not worth it. never buy again."
1.0,Too small needed 30 inch but will keep it because it's good quality and does not cause any skin irritation
1.0,"Looks very cheap in person, so I returned it!"
1.0,No ball at the end. Poorly made. Stones are lopsided and not like the picture at all. Don’t falsely advertise. It’s such a waste of our time.
1.0,"If you are plus size, most likely your arms are as well. The arm opening are very small. I ordered one size larger than I am. My hopes was to be free flowing and loose. Everything was except the arms. I literally had to cut the seams out from underneath so my upper arms can fit comfortably."
1.0,Very thin material for the price. I tried 4 different sizes to find the right fit. Not worth the hassle.
1.0,"The fabric was thin, hard and cheap. The size was off and smaller then it should have been."
1.0,"Way too small, Asian xl and American xl greatly differ!"
1.0,Material not soft and too scratchy . GSon did not like design .
1.0,"The item description says the size of the earrings is 4.72 inch, however it’s barely over 1 .5 inch.<br />Very misleading and extremely disappointing. Would’ve never bought if I knew the true size."
1.0,Good quality product just not enough room in the cup area and not enough support either.
1.0,came shipped with a broken strap
1.0,"The sleeve liners were already seperating at the stitching when it arrived.  I thought if I was just wearing it around the house it would be ok, but both sleeves have completely fallen apart within a month.  It's a shame as the rest of the garment is quite nice and comfortable.  The zipper is a little sticky but would be livable were it not for the fabric/stitching issues."
1.0,These glasses leave a film on the lenses every single day which is like white little pixie dust. It is horrible and you have to clean the glasses every single day.
1.0,Material is very thin & scratchy to wear.
1.0,The shirt looks nothing like the pic. I was sick and could not return on time and they won’t take it back.
1.0,This bag is the worst<br />You all really know how to make the pictures look good<br />The material is thin and cheap<br />people don't get this bag
1.0,Factory defective product. No quality control. Do not purchase. Wasted my time and money to return it.<br /> Picture one is probably how it should look.<br /> Pictures two and three is how it arrived.<br />Not capable of stretching the shoe lengthwise
1.0,"Fits really tight, totally not modest for church if ur butt is on the fuller end, and the quality is really cheap…. Just had to return it."
1.0,Cool mask but it's very cheaply made and the lights won't turn off like they're supposed to
1.0,"Received a pretty good sized blister, after only two runs. Bought the correct size, based on sizing chart. I will be returning these."
1.0,"So I was pretty excited for this. My ears hate earbuds and even wearing a hat over them does not keep them in my ears while running, so I hoped this would do the trick. Got it all set up pretty easily, liked how you could move the ear pieces inside the hat to adjust it, it hooked up to my phone no problem. The hat is rather itchy, which I found strange, I wear a beanie almost every day in the winter so it was definitely something with the material. But it wasnt bad enough where I couldnt or wasnt gonna wear it. So then I got outside, headed down the driveway, stretching out as I went. Started to run...and the thing started shorting out. My phone was in my pocket, and my arms moving back and forth were somehow blocking the signal. So I moved it into my little belt where my arms were definitely not obstructing it, and it still shorted out when I started to run. So I put it into my bra and it still had a problem at random times. No idea what it was. And then I tried to mess with the volume or skip a song, and putting my hand on the little buttons caused it to once again disconnect. So halfway down the road now and I barely got to run a hundred meters. I finally just turned it off and turned up the volume on my phone. I think I tried it one more day with the same outcome. It just wouldnt stay connected. Didnt even get to try it in really cold weather. Huge disappointment."
1.0,The center part of one of the studs popped out and I did not notice until later in the day. Therefore I do not know where it happened.<br />Needless to say I was not happy.<br />I guess this speaks for the quality of this product.
1.0,These are for a younger generation. Not what i thought from the add. So i returned this.
1.0,The stones were not set correctly in the brackets. They would be cute if they were. I’m upset because I really wanted to wear them. Whatever. I’ll just have to get some that are better quality.
1.0,This is the first baby outfit that I have purchased on line that I did not like. It looks cheap and is poorly made. The hat would fit me an the bodysuit is as wide as it is long. I gave it to my granddaughter for her dolls! Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Took these hiking and everyone saw my buttocks. I hadn't realized until my husband approached me from behind and said I wad mooning everyone. Beyond embarrassing. I got these in 2 different colors and they are both see through. Also, they are not high wasted at all and they are not tight fitting like the original purchased at costco!"
1.0,"Aside from waiting 74 days for this to arrive, the color is completely different.  Very unhappy."
1.0,it did not compress it was a loose tank top!
1.0,Way smaller than it appears. 2x will fit a small child
1.0,"The plastic hinge piece broke after one week, I really liked the band but it did not last long."
1.0,Glasses came and had scratches on the right lense as soon as they were taken out of the plastic.would not recommend this product .this looks like it came that way from the seller as they came in plastic and a box.
1.0,"after one day, the black pair, one side clip missing, as in the picture.<br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,Extremely small. A 2x is as big as a large ... very disappointed.
1.0,"Cheap looking, cheap feeling, and horribly uncomfortable.<br />Only but if you want to wear for 30 seconds before the shoes and your feet fall apart."
1.0,"I wish I had taken photos!! I ordered a Small and Medium for my daughter’s birthday, with the intent to return the one that didn’t fit. When she opened the packages—the waist was sewn on halfway in the front and half way in the back—of both sizes!!! Whoever was in charge of quality control on this lot number should be fired! I sent both back and orders a replacement for the small….only to get a dress with the exact same flaw. Don’t bother."
1.0,Bought same size as other brands. Not easy on or off. Took 20 minutes to get on. Much more difficult to get on or off than other brands.
1.0,very small...at least 3 sizes and its very very short!
1.0,They aren't anywhere near close to red. They're orange. Took forever to arrive.
1.0,"No me agradó la textura de la tela, muy delgada y ligera, para talla 14 no es apta la tela tan liviana. No lo volvería a comprar en ningún tono de color."
1.0,"Horrible adhesive! The lifters feel rubbery and do not stick or lift. The nipple covers were ok. What can i say, you get what you pay for"
1.0,Should have trusted the reviews. Terrible. Cheap material. Awful fit. I’m 5’10” 140 pounds. Ordered a medium since all of the reviews said they ran small.... I have bird legs and they’re so tight! I bend my knee and the pant falls off my butt. Terrible cut and quality. Do not order. Worst product I’ve EVER ordered on the internet.
1.0,Didn't like it doesn't fit right
1.0,Cheap material. Does not fit well.  Does not look like the photo. They make their products near impossible  to return.
1.0,this mask is child like and not made for adults.  It fits way too small dont buy
1.0,"Didnt care for it ,a cut off sleeveless tee shirt is more comfortable and fits right!<br />These shirts are way oversized and are 100% polyester! Rather have at least a poly/cotton blend or all cotton for comfort !"
1.0,"I purchased a small in women’s. The label says small, but it is more like a men’s large. Don’t waste your time."
1.0,"This is NOT a hat!! It is a tiny accessory. I think it was supposed to have a barrette on the back, but ours just had glue blobs where maybe a barrette used to be 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1.0,"This is a garbage piece of expensive sleepwear from a garbage company. The dye in the pajamas runs and stains everything. Sweat even a little bit at night? Expect to wake up stained red. Wash them even in cold water? Expect everything it touches to turn red, including the gold trim. Contacted the company and have been waiting nearly a month for a reply. You’re better off just burning your $125 than spending it on this mess of a product and incurring additional costs trying to get red stains off of everything including your SO."
1.0,"The title said it all. It clung like a tube sock. The top would easily shift when carrying your child, exposing you to everyone. The fabric is very thin, and any other color would have made it translucent. Would not recommend."
1.0,These dont stay on the ears and break easily when you try to bend them to fit
1.0,Not the shirt described or pictured. Not a V neck and the color is off.
1.0,I didn’t like the shade of black as it looked washed out
1.0,"I honestly couldn’t even try it on. The head hole is SO SMALL with no stretch at all. So unless I want to completely rip and ruin the collar, I can’t wear it."
1.0,It did not fit my watch but it said it would
1.0,The shoe is more like a sock
1.0,These are advertised and look like other masks I really liked but they are not the cool fabric they run small and are not comfortable
1.0,"It does not stay put and it does not absorb a thing. The pic I added was after about a mile and a half of running and it had already slipped almost all the way back to my bun. And it certainly doesn't stop the sweat. I mean, it's hot and I'm running, so I know I'll have sweat on my face/head, but I've run with and without this waste of a headband and it makes absolutely no difference. Ultimately, the sweat stings my eyes and I was hoping for something that would stay in place and help cut some of what's coming off of my scalp. This is NOT it."
1.0,It is a waste of money buying this useless trash. it is not working.
1.0,One wouldn't even unscrew to put it on.
1.0,Everything is totally different especially the sleeves
1.0,very small but pretty it barely fits on me
1.0,This Leo fit bit was not flattering and the look is important to 11 year olds.
1.0,La blusa llegó en mal estado . Tiene un hueco en la parte de adelante . envío foto
1.0,Wat too tight.
1.0,thin material!
1.0,My product was not was it said. It can not fit a womans arm of any size. Now they want me to pay the shipping to send it back
1.0,Be aware that just because it says white it is not white it is definitely a cream color
1.0,"I'm pretty sure this dress was made for a youth, not women's size at all. I couldn't even fasten the snap on the collar. I would not recommend this dress unless you are tiny."
1.0,Poor deceptive  description
1.0,The sizing is pretty off. If you have boobs at all this isn’t for you.
1.0,"I tried using them as a daily nipple ring to spice up my life, but unfortunately they just didn't work out. They're cute as heck, but throughout the day they somehow flipped around, so the flat part was facing out and the bow-shaped part was pressing into my boobie, and with the help of my bra, by the end of the day I had a nice bow shaped mark on both sides of both of my nipples. I'm going to just stick with metal balls.<br />-.-"
1.0,"I needed waterproof gloves and bought these since the description stated the gloves were waterproof.  I have them only one star because they were the opposite of waterproof, the gloves actually acted more like a sponge and soaked up the water instead of resisting it."
1.0,I thought this shackle was awesome until it failed. The rotating part was all I found on my carabiner.  At least I was able to find my key fob and this shackle fell apart before a full month had passed making the return a breeze.
1.0,This product is most definitely sized incorrectly. I usually wear a 36 DD but sometimes get 38 DD to wear on the tighter setting. I ordered  the 38 DD just to make sure it was not going to be too tight as different bras fit  differently.. this thing was so tight and I was bulging out everywhere there is no way this is a 38 DD. It is labels 38DD but feels like maybe tight 36DDor maybe even 34-I’m definitely returning kind of upsetting as I was hoping to get away for VS $70 bras but I guess not
1.0,Way too small around the back and too big in the cup...sizes aren't accurate...looks pretty but that's it. Won't buy again.
1.0,"I ordered my size, too small, next size, too small,  next size too big.  Ugh  sent back three times."
1.0,"If you found your way here by searching “men’s purple sunglasses”, back out now. These are only suited for a man, if the man in question is a child dressing up as a man. I got them for my sons prom outfit and they look like he’s wearing Groucho Marx glasses out of a box of Frosted Flakes"
1.0,Broken upon delivery. The screw was not attached and the temple fell off after opening the product. Do not recommend these at all
1.0,"It took long enough to get here and when I did get it, the face was twice as big as it appears in the picture..<br />I will never wear it..."
1.0,Split apart during the first week of wearing it. Band was very stiff and uncomfortable.
1.0,Very pretty to look at but the wires are so fine that they broke off after the first wearing.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,I suppose these might work if you didn't try to speak while wearing one.
1.0,Cute BUT the seam is in the front and did not match at ALL pattern repeated very close together. I am disappointed I didn't return it in time.
1.0,too big...
1.0,Not flattering. Has a high waist line.  Material is cheap.  Faded drastically after one washing 😔.  Fits like a child's clothing
1.0,Fitting is weird. I wish waste line is bit stretchable. Waste of money
1.0,"I've bought many blouses by Patty Boutik, but this one has heavy fabric which is way too much for 90 degree weather. It's also girdle strength stretch, so uncomfortably tight. The style is cute, but doesn't work for a cute summer top. Returning it."
1.0,"I loved the colors of this top.  When I saw that it was the batwing style, I ordered a size Small hoping it wouldn’t be too large.  Well it was HUGE!  Way too much fabric.  Returned it immediately."
1.0,Not at all what i expected. An uncomfortable slipper that does nothing well. Lucky they were cheap. They smell like China. I returned them to the landfill whence they came.
1.0,Está bien feo y queda mal
1.0,2x was too small. If you have a fupa and or thick thighs and I mean THICK not slim with big legs than these are NOT for you!
1.0,This a very cheap one piece dirndl and not at all like the picture. There is no braiding on the collar line and the shirt of the dirndl is part of the whole outfit as one piece where as the photo makes it looks like you need to purchase a shirt. The eyeholes for the ribbons are not detailed and ornate like in the photos. The sleeves are flat and not ruffled. this is a super cheap ill fitting halloween costume and not an authenticate german style dirndl.
1.0,This sizing chart is definitely wrong. I normally wear 36D.
1.0,Shape differs from the product picture
1.0,They are very tight good by blood circulation ....
1.0,HORRIBLE!!! Seller was useless . Dress was cheap and see through. I don't know what kind of material was used but definitely not what was shown on picture!!!!!
1.0,I love shoes....I bought these shoes last year in July....great price Dope shoe.....the reason why I took my rating back today was the first time I wore them since I bought them (didn't I say I love shoes....lol the shoe was perfect til the hook that goes in the hole feel off before I could get outta the door.... unwearable....hope I can fix it but I doubt it....and I loved the shoes too 😕
1.0,"Horrible, brittle plastic. Was either already cracked at the base or cracked when she put them on. 6yr old. Just unwrapped for Christmas!<br />Going to order a different brand. Returning this."
1.0,Received these today. The size 10 would literally fit my baby that wears a 4.<br /><br />Returning immediately. Don’t waste your $ or Time.
1.0,It’s crap.  Tearing on both sides and I only put a wallet and phone in it!  Nothing heavy.  Product is made cheap!!!
1.0,The picture does not match what was mailed. Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money !!!
1.0,"Says this was delivered, however my security camera says otherwise. Be careful buying this!"
1.0,Extremely small....way to expensive....not worth it
1.0,These were terrible. Started out as a happy purchase but they were discolored and ruined in less than a month. I was removing them for showers to prevent this. Not worth $15.
1.0,"I'm 5'1 & 110lbs. As a 32A cup, the top was way too big! I ordered a size small and it would fit a cup c or better. The bottom was also really small! Would probably fit a size xs. Quality looked good and design was cute. But hard to get the right fit since it comes in a set. Has to return"
1.0,"The sleeves on this fit very weird.  I was so excited to give it as a father's day gift, but it is a weird fit.  Never had this problem with a tshirt before."
1.0,Don’t buy! Cheap piece of junk! Returned and haven’t received my refund.
1.0,Its falsely advertised. I did not receive the dress that was showed. The material is cheap and not whatvi ordered.
1.0,"With this purchase I convinced myself not to buy Chinese products again. The quality is poor and the workmanship is very poor. In short, cheap junk."
1.0,Would never buy again. Cheap made and broke while i was trying to get out of pack. Real thin and cheap
1.0,"I am 5'1 and 115 lbs and ordered both the 02 Navy loose fit set and the 01 Black snug fit set in Small. The 02 (joggers) were soft and ran a bit large. I have long legs and short torso and the crotch in pants is very low so these may be better for taller women. The top fit great and as pictured but of course was a bit too long on me. It leaves to much material at waist to ""tuck"" in. Now the second set - a very different story. The pants were way too short and barely came to my ankle.  The look nothing like the picture. They were also overly short in the rise and tight in the waist with a cheap thick elastic band that rolls around and twists since it's not sewn down properly. They are leggings so a fitted snugness is expected, but the material is only polyester, not a blend like the other set, so they do not have the same stetch softness. The top was just ridiculously made. The scoop ""boat neck"" is so narrowly sewn, it rides up and stands up rather than laying flat. It is not wide enough to go off my shoulder at all. The 01 set is very cheaply made and sewn so poorly it looks like a homemade project. The 02 sets are sewn well and material is very nice, I just need an XS since I'm petite and they don't make one. There are no brand tags in either product and the inconsistent manufacturing and sizing is enough for me to return both.  Disappointing because this seemed like a brand that cares about it's product."
1.0,"I’m very frustrated. I purchased this vest for watching my son play lax in unpredictable Michigan weather. I whole sitting around the house, I decided to wear my new heated vest. The battery had been fully charged, so it was ready to go. The vest pre-heated, then flipped on to the low setting. It lasted all of about 3 minutes before shutting off. I couldn’t turn it back on without unplugging the battery pack and then plugging it back in. Again, pre-heat, low heat, then off, all in the span of about 10 minutes. I checked the battery percentage—96%, so I know that’s not the issue. It’s defective. No problem, I’ll exchange it. Nope!! I can only get a refund, and then I have to re-purchase it…for a higher price!! So, so frustrated!!! I even passed the link around to a ton of friends and I know of at least 5 {but probably closer to 10} friends who purchased this vest. I should get some sort of kickback, NOT a defective vest, then have to pay MORE to get one that works! Very disappointed."
1.0,missing merchandise
1.0,This band is impossible to remove! I used it twice and will be throwing it away! It takes a good 10 minutes to change it out! First band I have ever purchased that is such a pain to take off!
1.0,Really itchy and not very warm
1.0,Can't pull it down over my chest
1.0,I bought this for my daughter for her ballet lessons and after just 1 week of use and just 1 wash it has already begun to unstitch. Not happy with the quality of the product.
1.0,Grossly missized! Way too small. I used the size chart measurements as a guide. I normally wear a size 10. I ordered the XL/12 based on the measurements. They are ridiculously small. I barely got them up over my butt (so definitely no getting the zipper zipped)! Too bad because the style is cute.
1.0,What was delivered is nowhere near as cute or high quality as what is shown on the photo. Don’t buy these. Hopefully I can return them
1.0,"I'm so upset with this. the material is all spandex did not specify this in the details. Not like pic at all. And the letters look slightly beige in the pic, its actually pink....ugh."
1.0,"I bought two pairs, one to wear while at work and the other to wear around the house. Well, the white rubber connectors that are on the bottom of the clogs on both pairs fell out. I managed to find it and glued it in using gorilla glue however,  I just wasn't lucky with the home pair. Also, one of the rubber straps came out and started to tear. Don't even waste your money buying these."
1.0,Most low quality product I've ever bought on Amazon by far. The middle finger portion broke immediately. The thumb and the middle finger both broke the first time I put it on.
1.0,"I don’t recommend. It’s cheap, fits bad and accentuates all the wrong stuff."
1.0,These look way better in the picture. They arrived and I felt like the shoe looked very cheap. I returned them.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, would not recommend."
1.0,Did not met expectations
1.0,This is a poorly made dress. I would like a refund for the see thru slip you call a dress. I would have to wear a slip. If I could give this a 0 star I would. I needed this dress for a funeral. It is a disappointment.
1.0,These are awful. I thought they were beaded but are just knotted up like fabric.
1.0,I bought XL size which was so ridiculously small. Couldn't cover/ wrap around my chest or waist. What a waste!
1.0,This was not what I expected. Looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Sizing chart is waaay off! Bought 3 shirts from this seller and NONE OF THEM are sized right!! Had to pay for delivery AND return fees!!!
1.0,Item is very disappointing. As you can see from the photos this doesn't look anything like they advertised.
1.0,Poor material- almost like a swimsuit cover.
1.0,Very poor quality. Watch stopped working after a few months and strap broke.
1.0,Dont waste your money
1.0,Too small tried to return did not happen. Will never buy from this company again.
1.0,Band only lasted 2 weeks or so then it started to rip had to throw it out i feel its not very durable or sturdy would not recommend
1.0,"I can't wear the shoes as they are now. They are too short and not wide enough.  I love the style, but not the fit.  I have to figure out what to do with them."
1.0,Not recommended.
1.0,The white stripes were made of vinyl. I figured I could have made it myself on a cricut machine so I sent it back.
1.0,they were way to small.....
1.0,"Loved these at first, but then the elastic pulled out from the seams, mostly in the butt, so not a great look. Very disappointed 😕"
1.0,"If ordering, go 2 sizes up to be comfortable. Material doesn.t really stretch"
1.0,My daughter wore this for less than 5 minutes before it broke. Disappointed in the quality.
1.0,The purple splatter is all synthetic.
1.0,Order two sizes up does not go beyond large
1.0,It didn't keep time. Maybe the battery was old but I didn't want to spend more money to find out. It's too bad because the overall design is nice.
1.0,"I ordered an XL, the top is more like an XS. The choker is a matching piece of fabric that has two buttons for closure. The string that ties up the back of the top came thrown in the bag for you to string up the shirt on your own. The skirt was true to size however.<br />Fabric was super thin, very transparent. The pearls and rhinestones were all over the garment and not just the front which i did appreciate. Sending back because i can’t wear 1/2 of an outfit.<br />I am a size 12, 36DDD"
1.0,Coating completely coming off after 6 months. Do not recommend.
1.0,The quality is not good at all.
1.0,"I normally don't write reviews but I was highly disappointed with this shirt. I ordered a small. The shirt appeared to be a one size fits all. There was no tag and no size on the shirt. It fit like a curtain. Shirt was also a bright blue, and I was expecting gray."
1.0,size not as described. Had to return.Item arrived all bunched up in a platic bag and looked like a sun dried raisin when i opened it.
1.0,Bought a couple of rings and a set of earrings. The rings arrived and the earrings were not in the package. Will not buy again.
1.0,"Beautiful, too short & too small"
1.0,"The very first time I attempted to size the straps for my daughter, one strap completely shredded and fell apart. The backpack material is very thin. The lunchbox is very small. I had to end up ordering a second lunchbox and will now have to order a second backpack as the strap is not repairable. This set was a complete waste of money!"
1.0,"fabric is not good if you need it to stretch, ends up showing up white or lighter and doesn't look good when stretched out. not good for curvy gals:/"
1.0,If your curvy this isn’t the dress for you actually it isn’t a dress at at I’m 5”4” so ideally it should fit it barely covers my hips this should be listed as a shirt
1.0,Color is a not a bright gray as shown; it is more of a muddy brownish gray
1.0,The pearl came apart from the setting after 3 months. Not eligible for return or replacement. Not impressed
1.0,"Do not buy this dress... the material is poor quality and the leg slit sits on an awkward side of the leg, not flattering at all! It is definitely not worth the price!"
1.0,Excited to try the mask and hat but the strap to hold the mask on arrove broken.
1.0,I orderex a bunch of stuff from this store and never will again. Print is nice but size fit 2 to 3 times smaller than i wear. I ordered 2 times bigger and it still wasnt big enough. The other items on this order were do cheaply made and  fabric flimsy. Totol waste of money. No return label no follow up till weeks later. Do disgusted i just donated to good will. Maybe somebody will like it<br /> I normally wear 10 or 12.  Ordering an 18 didnt help.
1.0,One day and already the thread is fraying.
1.0,"The sizing on these is WAY off. I measured my daughter’s foot to make sure I got the right size, and they are several sizes too small. She has another pair of ballet slippers that nearly identical in the same size and you can see there is almost a 1 inch difference. I contacted the seller and so far the only thing they have told me is I need to go by their size chart, which I did. I even measured the inside of the slipper and it doesn’t match up with their chart."
1.0,It’s weird on breast does not give you full support runs big
1.0,After a few months this bag fell apart and started flaking..
1.0,"Not much else to add. Amazon took care of it though, so all good."
1.0,"They are cheap and the lenses dramatically distorted your view! I've purchased sunglasses in this price range many times before, and these are BY FAR the worst I've had!<br />They are 100% being returned!"
1.0,Broke second time I wore it.
1.0,"The description states this is a ""loose"" cardigan, running true to size. Therefore, I sized down. This fits me ""okay"" but it is a normal (true to size) fit, not loose. If you want it to fit loose, size up. I would have entertained returning it for a larger size, however, this is the most stiff, itchy cheap material! It is a thinner cardigan, but not super thin. The color runs true to the picture. This is going back immediately."
1.0,Rose gold wore off in just a few days. Maybe my ears break out as well.
1.0,Does NOT fit a fitbit charge 2.
1.0,hard to click closed
1.0,The back tie string needed to be a little longer
1.0,one piece is different quality on bottom part of the dress
1.0,"Rated one star because the box it came in was pretty cool. Other than that, the watch is complete junk. Gave it to my fiance and within 3 days he said the metal around the faceplate broke and the glass face fell out. I emailed the company immediately and got no response. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,"In under five minutes, the ribbon on the wand started falling apart. My daughter was just gently waving it around while ballet dancing and this happened. I can't believe it didn't last 5 minutes."
1.0,Labeled as XL but is actually a xxl. Can’t wear it.
1.0,Came in with the ziper busted not true to size was way to small
1.0,The necklace arrived in two different colors. The lace was green and the chains were almost orange.
1.0,Childsize. No way I was getting into those.
1.0,Really stiff. Listed as leather. I couldn’t tell if that was true. They were too plastic-y feeling for me. I returned them.
1.0,never will by that brand any more.
1.0,"Horrible product!!!! I purchased this dress and there was a huge hole in the back of it, almost like someone cut a circle out of it"
1.0,Received the wrong product
1.0,"very disappointing with this jingle bell Christmas musical tie. i was looking for a Christmas theme print on the tie, like he one shown on the picture, its just came plane tie with red and green lines. not ever close to what is shown on the pictures. very very disappointed, and price is too high for a plain tie with lines, not worthy purchase for this tie, As for the jingle bells, do you think a grown up man will like the music on a tie. piece of creap"
1.0,"Would not buy again! Not worth the price at all, wish I could return it. Color is off too, not a true red"
1.0,"Not what I thought. It was super big but it fit through my shoulders, just needs to be narrower I felt huge in it, it’s definitely warm but not attractive at all."
1.0,These tank tops run so small. I got an XL that fits like a S. So frustrating!
1.0,Perhaps these are queen size - I have bought this product for years at SPANX stores and at Nordstroms.  They stay up very well but the knee high hose that this company sent to me fall down on my leg.  Also beware - S6 is very dark brown.  I didn’t catch that and now have the wrong color.
1.0,This is so cheap.  You can’t see the imprint.  Doesn’t look like the picture at all<br /><br />I’m sending it back
1.0,the name tag is just a card that has no protection like good luggage tags have.  Just looks CHEAP in person.
1.0,This is junk. Do not buy. It was broken upon arrival. Cheap quality.
1.0,"The quality was terrible,  it took forever to get here and to send back was a huge hassle."
1.0,These so not stay on your feet. Total waste of money!
1.0,DONT BUY
1.0,"I wish I could give a half star. Top edges were cut at an unintended angle, the dress material is itchy and cheap. The fabric is unraveling at the top. And it wasn’t near floor length like the photo. The lining is really thin and clingy. The only thing that was close to accurate, but still off, is the color. It is in fact blue, but not bright blue like it said when I ordered it. It’s more of a dark navy. I’m returning it."
1.0,Did not like the fit and they ride up in the back.
1.0,I ordered according to the size chart - I have a 36 in waist so I bought the XX Large.  It appears to be 2 sizes too big. I will be returning.
1.0,"I didn’t wanted to write this review until I didn’t give the seller the chance to make this work. I emailed them and no answer. So. This is my story. I ordered a size small and didn’t fit. The company doesn’t accept returns so I do a new purchase, get my medium and comes out with the sleeves broken. I feel very disappointed. I needed this for a photo shoot, I lost the appointment... so sad."
1.0,Color heavily misrepresented! Not as pictured at all but good size & material though
1.0,Do not fit how they are advertised!<br />wouldn’t recommend!!
1.0,I think the sizes should be bigger text. I put 8 gauge but I ended up with nose rings not a Prince Albert.
1.0,"I read the reviews and ordered my skinny minni 7 year old a size 7 and it was way too tight for her to fit into. So I returned it and got a size 8, but it was still way too small for her to even try on! Everyone saying it fits as expected, my girl is TINY, a skinny string bean, and it wouldn't even go on her arms!!! I am amazed, and won't even order another size up, it's just not worth the hassle."
1.0,"These lasted about 12 hours on my 15-month-old. The morning after I put them on her, she walked up to me and handed me the earring she had just pulled out and the ""locking"" back was nowhere to be found. Thinking I either put it on wrong or that particular back just happened to be faulty, I tried again. Same thing. Roughly 12 hours later I noticed both backs had come off. I was lucky to find the earrings."
1.0,Ran small and poor quality fabric.
1.0,Does not fit a Nike Apple Watch series 3
1.0,I only got 9 pairs of earrings. Is it counting each earring to make this 18 items?
1.0,This is a beautiful set BUT the post on one earring was broken completely off so I requested a replacement and the second set came and BOTH post on earrings are bent to the point of almost broken.  Sending both sets back for a refund.
1.0,"terrible quality, see through, cheap material, ugly collars , cheap buttons do not purchase"
1.0,Very flimsy. Needs to be stiffer
1.0,I didn't expect it to be so tiny.  The links are so little you can hardly tell what they are. I definitely wouldn't have spent that much money on it had i known.
1.0,"Terrible quality, falling apart on the first day"
1.0,Not at all what it looks like in picture!! The cut s more like a shrug! Does not come down in back at all
1.0,"Great shorts. Thin, comfortable and like the zippered pockets very much. But The pockets broked already. First the zipper which I thought it was just a great idea to keep my wallet secure but right after that my keys came off through a hole in the pocket and NO! The keys were in a key case no naked keys making holes inside pockets. Been around for too long to know better. It is just bad cheaply workmanship. Are they supposed to last more than a month?"
1.0,It fit nothing like the picture. The split was not as high. The neck was not an uneven cut to allow for an off the shoulder look. I’m was very disappointed. I ordered the the black and white and requested alreger size to see if it made a difference. Not to mention I originally ordered this dress last year and am just getting it
1.0,It busted as soon as I tried it on. Very cheap.
1.0,The back does not stay closed poor quality
1.0,wallet basically came completely un-stitched on the side where the cards go
1.0,"This is NOT a plus size belt.  It is supposed to fit up to 42&#34; waist but can't get it closed on a 41&#34; waist -- not even close.  Instead of bothering to send it back, I gave it to someone with a 34&#34; waist."
1.0,Material looked like a slip. Not enough fringe and it was only on the front. I should return it.
1.0,"After about 6 weeks of wear and tear these began to fall apart. They are not waterproof, the souls leak. They are comfortable and 11.5 fit as an 11. But, would not take these on a real hiking trip."
1.0,Much smaller than the stated size
1.0,Arrived broken in pieces. Very cheap quality. Do not buy!
1.0,Way too small.I usually wear a small.this was a small but fit like a x small
1.0,"This product took over a month to ship. When I got them, the laces are fake and glue holding them failed day one.  Less than two weeks later the whole shoe is falling apart."
1.0,It is a good thing that I always have a backup plan for special events. The picture looked perfect to wear to a wedding and the price less than expected. I should have known that the price would reflect the quality. I will say that the sleeveless top was pretty but much too short. The pants had no tag to indicate the front from the back and sized disproportionately from the top. I ordered a size 18 and received pants sized at least 28. The only good thing I can say about this outfit is that the color was nice. I would never buy again from that company again nor recommend them . My advice is to find another company to buy from.
1.0,Quality is poor and it doesn’t look as the picture.
1.0,"Not good, the fit is horrible and the quality is terriblE"
1.0,"I wanted a pale blue purse, but this is more grey/green than a light blue. I returned it because of the color."
1.0,"Aunque notificaron que el paquete llegó a mi casillero en miami, mi remesador me demostró que no fue cierto. Me ha sido imposible contactar a los vendedores porque no ofrece ninguna opción para hacerlo. Denuncio por este medio, que perdí mi dinero y nadie se hace responsable ni me rinde cuentas."
1.0,"Cheap thin material, like something you’d find at Walmart."
1.0,So small- cheezey
1.0,suze us totally off!!!
1.0,Not high quality
1.0,Cheap looking and has a strange odor.  Totally not worth the money. I don't recommend.
1.0,Very poor product quality. You can get better glasses for less at any gas station. Do not buy. All of the metal is either unpolished or covered in glue residue.
1.0,I wore the necklace once and it changed colors quickly.  I was . Expecting at least a few wears out of it. I guess that didnt happen .  Its beautiful but not worth wasting money .
1.0,"If you’re a tiny Asian, go for it. If you’re a regular sized white female.. prob gonna make you feel like strangling yourself with this waste of hard earned money."
1.0,This is NOT a set. It implies you’re getting both items. Most of these sorts of sibling items come with whichever size big kid combined with a newborn romper…. SOLD SEPARATELY in spite of the image!! NOT WORTH THE MONEY
1.0,too small too short
1.0,To small and very thin
1.0,It’s a pretty color but broke within 5 minutes of me putting it on.
1.0,"Water goes into it, warranty is a joke, you have to pay the shipping, that is likely more than the watch cost. Casio used to be a good brand, not anymore."
1.0,"They look nice, the detail on them is good. But I wore them for all of a few days and I went to wipe off the usual ear funk that collects on them, I start wiping it lightly and it cracks right in half. After this happened I took a closer look and there were faults and cracks all the way up it."
1.0,Is not the right color
1.0,Only thing good is the weight. The Glory Bead is some sort of digitized form of Jesus. Not Mother Mary. The cross has a blob..I am guessing it suppose to be Jesus but its just a blob. Horrible.
1.0,Material was very cheap and overall not a good product. Made like a Halloween costume.
1.0,"Not comfortable. Thickness was good at all, almost like swimsuit material ."
1.0,"This bracelet is NOT large as described. If anything, it maybe be large for a small child."
1.0,I wore this mask a few hours yesterday. It nearly ripped my nose off. It’s still red this morning. The straps fit too low. They either leave a gap or mostly fit around the back of your neck. WORSE EVER!! It’s going on the trash since I threw the box away.
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on
1.0,Received it. Opened it. Set it. And it didn’t work.
1.0,This Was awful the leather started wearing off within one day. It was cheap shouldn't have expected better.
1.0,Poor quality and shoes did not appear as pictured.
1.0,cute but not true to size looks like a dress but on a curvy woman it's a shirt. if u have hips and thighs go a size up.
1.0,"Knife cuts right through the glove, I highly recommend don’t waste your money on this cutting glove. It’s false advertisement!!"
1.0,I have another pair of these bootcut jeans bought from Amazon that I love and fit great.  This last pair I purchased are awful!!  The bootcut leg is at least two inches wider than the first pair I bought.  The new pair looks straight out of the 1970’s bell bottoms style.  Really wish Gloria Vanderbilt pants were consistent!  I have Amanda jeans in different sizes that fit the same and now this new pair of Amanda jeans look ridiculous and are being returned!
1.0,This shirt was SO short. It didn’t even fall to my hips...more Iike a belly shirt! The top fit fine but the product I received certainly was not as pictured
1.0,Really poor quality and design does not look as nice as the photo.
1.0,"I bought this for a trip to China. My spouse and I had four suit cases and used all four strips. When we arrived China ( direct flight ), two stripes were lost and another two were very loose already. On the way back, again, we tightened the left two strips, both of them got loose. I don’t recommend this products for traveling. It doesn’t work at all."
1.0,We did not buy these but the part numbers are different between a 15hp 2 stroke yamaha and the 9.9.
1.0,The dress is way too small and short. I cant even wear it but it fits my ten year old. The XL is probably more like a medium.
1.0,So I wore the mask for 3 mins and my face started to itch and break out. Before you ask no I’m not allergic to latex. My face got red and i had to rush home to wash my face.
1.0,"I could not use it, waste of money,."
1.0,This is the smallest key chain I cannot even read what it says
1.0,"This is somebodys oc, Stolen oc I should say."
1.0,"This is a very beautiful time piece, I had one 3 years ago and I lost it. Now unfortunately I didn't receive what I paid for."
1.0,very disappointed and i feel misled. i order from amazon on a regular basis and this is by far one of my biggest disappointments.<br />DO NOT ORDER THESE!!!
1.0,The packaging came damaged and the chain broke within 1 week. The stone doesn't even shine anymore.
1.0,Way too small but pretty good quality material
1.0,"My husband used these twice and the arm popped out and the lens also popped out. Piece of crap.Should have bought a pair at the drugstore where I could have returned. It now says it's too lare to return them after about 8 weeks, but only used twice."
1.0,"So this dress  is not good don't order it, it is short and mine came with a huge hole on the side and unfortunately I forgot about it in the back of my closet and I can't return it now . So I'm stuck with the dress that came with a hole"
1.0,not accurately sized & appear to be knock-offs
1.0,Do not buy! you will be disappointed. Cheap material I could not believe. it looks unfinished or it was made by a 5 years old. It took them over 3 weeks ship it and I received a month after it was ordered. save your money and time.
1.0,Ordered a large and it was more like an XS. Not very well made either. Returned.
1.0,"I'm not sure what &#34;one size&#34; means.  Obviously I thought it meant &#34;ONE SIZE FITS ALL&#34;  Well, it doesn't.  If you have any type of curvy form (above a size 34C) this product is not for you.  I am a 38C and had to send this back.  Way too tiny!"
1.0,It may work for other people but as far as driving at night with these didn't do anything for me actually made it worse that doesn't mean they won't work for someone else they just didn't work for me so I will be returning them
1.0,"As w/all Chinese goods, they're into saving every penny, lol,, I'm a man's 8, ordered 9,, got about a 6-6.5,, very loose around the instep too.  I'd pass,"
1.0,"First this is not the item in the pictures I own two of those dresses. This is not worth the same at all. This item is transparent, the picture is taken through the material to show how thin you can see the whole bra and even my belly button. The pockets are sewn incorrectly see pic and don't fit into the dress, it doesn't have an elastic band in the waist so you rip the seam to get it over your boobs and its the color of diarrhea.<br /><br />I have been trying to get a refund but instead I get illegible emails from people who don't speak English. After 2 months of back and forth the best I'm getting is an offer of 30% refund when they are using images of a product that is not what they're selling."
1.0,"Loved the color & the cut. However, the liner fell apart after just one washing in the gentle cycle. Would share photos if it would let me.  So disappointed."
1.0,Turned brown and discolored a week after wearing.
1.0,Watch band has signs of wear and tear. White paint/ color is worn off from the band and greyish color is peeking through it.  Going to return it
1.0,Totally different material looks soft but they are like a shiny material ... colors are very faded
1.0,"I bought 2 of these (1 from Amazon, 1 from Target), and both broke immediately - the metal portion on the side near where the hair comb is immediately breaks off if you so much of thinking of adjusting it to fit your child’s head."
1.0,Never ever think to buy it
1.0,Package came with a Pearl guarantee  cArd.  There was no pearl in the oyster. My daughter was in tears.
1.0,What a joke!!! These are half the size of a dime! The pictures are deceiving and overall this is ridiculous. Then they want to change to return them. Do not buy from this seller!
1.0,Toooo biggg .this is not a nose ring .
1.0,Bought for my husband because he Loved the look of them. Color starts flaking with it a week. Disappointing though because he Really liked them.
1.0,"Purchased for a bachelorette weekend. Very cute and fit as expected. However, after wearing one day in the pool I noticed the fabric was wearing down and pilling in the lower back area. After a second day of wearing it became very noticeable. Disappointed in the quality"
1.0,"These are nice masks, there is just not enough of them. At first I thought I must have gotten a child sized mask, but it was labeled for adults. It could cover my nose or my mouth but not both. So, if you are a petite adult (seriously, like a diminutive version of a human) this is a mask for you. If you are a regular sized person, go for a mask made with a bit more yardage off the bolt."
1.0,"Ad says these are over the knee socks. They are not. They come to the knee, not over the knee. If they shrink after they are washed, they will fit a kid."
1.0,"Color wasn't pink, more coral or light orange"
1.0,Not what I was expecting but adequate to put chargers in. I’m going t keep mine in car console as my 2017 Rav came with an array of chargers so they’re contained and easy to find if necessary.
1.0,"Flip was too big, foot moved around."
1.0,barely says on. very cheap.
1.0,"Said it was a xxl, but was too tight it wasn't a true xxl.  Was made in Asia. Maybe that’s why."
1.0,Size was wrong way too small description was incorrect
1.0,My special little person only wore hers for a few days and the name broke off.  Totally disappointed.
1.0,Did not fit properly. Extremely see through and cheap fabric!
1.0,Pulled drawstring to close pants and it ripped through. They are flimsy. Don’t waste your time.
1.0,Extremely poor quality.
1.0,These lenses did not fit my Radarlock frames as described. They were not wide enough to lock into the frame.
1.0,So small up top I couldn't zip it. I had to return it. It was soooo cute though.
1.0,"The fabric was of a very cheap quality, the description was misleading as the pants were blue and a different style, overall a bad experience especially when I have had some good purchases in the past with this company,returned this one."
1.0,Waste of money. One side is so dark you can hardly even see the image.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:b974bb9ba1872f06d317b6f61b1f200d]] This robe is just for show. There is zero absorption, and the felt material causes shocks in dry climates.<br /><br />Buyer beware."
1.0,Fit very poorly and design doesnt look like what you get
1.0,Super cute but not at all the size I ordered...orderes 2xx and it's maybe medium..
1.0,Bought a size larger than my usual and too small and had a hole in them
1.0,I am so disappointed with the poor quality of this belly button ring literally broke within the first 24 hours of wearing it I would skip buying this and go elsewhere it’s not worth the price for only lasting one day if that’s the case it should be five dollars or less
1.0,Was so small it won't an adult at all.
1.0,I ordered a plus size women size and it fit a size 14 girl.
1.0,this bracelet looks like something for a little girl or a Halloween costume- get what you pay for!
1.0,"I try to pay attention to the size descriptions on the product and not amazons size chart. This was so tiny even though I ordered an XL. Their sizes are off, this is a jumpsuit meant for medium or smaller."
1.0,Terrible. Stitching came apart at the straps after one wash. Do not buy.
1.0,"The material is so harsh and unflattering. It looks nice, but feels like i'm wearing a plastic bottle. It does not deal with heat well. It gets tight when it gets hot.<br /><br />Edit: I’ve ended falling in love with this shirt. After a few washes it became soft and comfortable to wear. Don’t get too sweaty in it."
1.0,I ordered a size up and could tell it was too small as soon as I opened the package. Tried it on and returned it. I would have gotten another size but XL was the largest available.
1.0,"The band has a plastic covering over it and it wears off and starts to discolor. 45 days after I bought it so I cannot even return it. Stay away from this company,"
1.0,"These slippers are for indoor and outdoor use, however the soles disagree. I stepped on wet concrete outside and went inside. There was absolutely no traction on the tile when the soles were even the slightest bit damp. I slipped and broke my tailbone and sprained my wrist. Would not recommend. If you want to use them inside only, you better not go into a steamy bathroom."
1.0,Way too small. Order two sizes up
1.0,Returned it. Very cheap looking. You get what you pay for
1.0,"The sizes are so wonky I have no idea which to buy, the quality was surprisingly okay but it's not great. Way too hard trying to figure out what size you'd be. I read so many reviews before purchasing and still didn't get the size right."
1.0,I bought these as a gift for my sister. And you can’t even see the images I ended up returning them I was really disappointed.
1.0,This cozy is way too short.  It is also very narrow.  The picture must be of a very very very short and small woman. I'm 5'3&#34; and it doesn't come down to my waist in the front. It certainly doesn't extend from my neck to my elbows.. not even close. Ask for dimensions before ordering this.  It would probably be great for a child.
1.0,broken-very cheap even if it worked. get what you pay for.
1.0,"Small. It was Sold as an adult hat, however it fit my seven year old son! Too small!😒"
1.0,I don’t like the size chart I chose a bigger size and it’s still small
1.0,Could hardly get it over my shoulders. This this is made for a China doll
1.0,Cheap and plain
1.0,"Do not buy!!!  These sunglasses are a rip off.  I noticed that after my morning bike ride, my vision was blinded, like after looking at a flash when taking a photo, so I purchased a UV flashlight and tested the glasses.  Although these sunglasses are advertised as 100% UV protected, they are not.  I am furious and hope that I can get a refund, because I am not using these sunglasses again."
1.0,I am very disappointed with the quality.  Once I washed the pants it showed the were cut on a bias instead of straight grain.  Side seam on left leg is in front.
1.0,Way too tight and narrow in the legs compared to the other Comfort Flex Hanes he wears.
1.0,Won't stay on your ears. They keep falling down at the top.
1.0,I did not receive the apricot top only the floral top
1.0,I have ordered several different colors of these pants. The color is NOT the same as their photos they advertise. The 1st two I didn't mind the dark dingy color..somehow it went well with the patterns but this pair is supposed to be a nice vibrant yellow with contrasting black lines. The yellow is 5 shades darker not a pretty mustard even but a dingy muddy orangy brown like mess. I am not happy..don't think I will be purchasing anything from them again.
1.0,"I'm sensitive to a lot of things, including most metals, which is why I wanted to try these. They burn like crazy. I tried using rubbing alcohol and soap and water to clean them first, but no matter what I do, they make my ears red and swollen, and they hurt so much I can't leave them in. So if you're really sensitive to things on your skin, these might not be for you."
1.0,I'm 5'7 size 10 and would not be able to wear this as anything but a bathing suit cover up.
1.0,"Item is supposed to replace 545070601, but does not physically fit, specifically sears 18&#34; chainsaw, because throttle/choke linkage interferes with chainsaw top cover. SO you may install it, get it running, just to find out you can't reassemble the cover. OR if you install the cover, can't even operate the throttle.<br />Even if this fits your chainsaw/weed wacker, the specific unit I received had an inoperable choke. Pulling choke lever should open choke AND lock throttle in max position. THEN when pressing the throttle and releasing the choke should automatically open. THIS DID NOT. The shafts were TIGHT in the body, despite an attempt by vendor to loosen I COULD SMELL the WD-40.."
1.0,Cheap.. already broken
1.0,"Not even close to the picture style, I dont like it at all"
1.0,These socks are not 35 below socks. Way too light. just a ripoff
1.0,Clasp was broken.
1.0,looked nothing like picture
1.0,Did not buy this item.
1.0,The paint and designs rubbed off and they looks awful within an hr of wearing them. Not worth the money
1.0,They break off the chain when you try to take the back off.
1.0,Too tight for a normal large size.
1.0,"Due to other reviews, I ordered 2 sizes bigger and its still too small!  It's cute, but that doesn't matter if they can't get the sizing even close!  Not happy..."
1.0,"Counterfeit item. WKRU2485 Q393 is not a Kate Spade item; it is also not made in Italy or the US, as expected; the bags materials are cheap and plasticky, it does not smell of leather."
1.0,Way too small. I ordered it two sizes larger and it wasn’t close to fitting at all.
1.0,Broken returned and broken again
1.0,"The heel protectors fit my heels perfectly. Unfortunately, after standing in the grass taking bridal party photos, the bottom of the protector broke and my heels sunk. The broken protector was just forced up the heel, and had to be pried off. Great product idea, but completely useless in practice."
1.0,"Hat is made of cheap material, and the logo is literally printed on one of those labels you have to cut off the back of your shirt. I literally feel guilty for buying this, highly warn away."
1.0,"Save your money. It’s cute looking, but the inside lining ripped on day one at the seams where arms meet shoulders."
1.0,I received this and it looks nothing like the picture. It is very thin not made of good quality material and runs like 2-3 sizes to big.
1.0,One strap was longer than another....horrible.  Luckily I can sew and was going to use for a costume.  It was cheap enough for that but if you're looking for something cute to wear out don't buy it.
1.0,Returning! The size was 4-10! But my sox month old was swimming in it! The neck hole is too large. The material was poor. None of the ends of the strings were cut off. This outfit would definitely fit a 12 to 18-month.
1.0,Batman is DC comics not Marvel.
1.0,I wear a medium top usually but I ordered a large just because reviews said it runs small.  But even the large was too small.  I am returning it.
1.0,"I bought this and returned them immediately, while packing I noticed the bad quality of the bags they were tearing off with no use also the zippers are vey poor quality."
1.0,Ripped off.  They did not fit right so I sent them back.  The kept them and my money!  Do no buy from this vendor!
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. It is was too large plus the print isn't the same as the picture. I realized the shirt was supposed to be large but not like this. It has no shape and looks like a pillow case. Plus the seller is extremely difficult to deal with. I would never purchase from this seller again!!!
1.0,"Both the shirt and shorts shrank quite a bit after the first wash, especially the shirt. It went from a 6t to I'd say a 12 months size! The hem in the shorts completely unraveled on both legs. The color faded as well, and the shirt got a hole in it after wearing it only once. Not at all happy with this purchase . Normally I would not leave a negative review, but the quality of this set should make the manufacturers ashamed of themselves! 😶"
1.0,"Just my opinion:  these glasses distort, making it impossible for me to use them.  And, man, are they ugly!<br />Note: these are cheap, but not returnable."
1.0,I ordered the two pair deal ...one regular and one night..received 2 day not one of each
1.0,No where near wine color.  Red with white speckles
1.0,Felt cheap and was tight.
1.0,"Quality is costumeish. Fit is enormous. I am 5'4, 145 lbs and I swim in a medium."
1.0,This shirt's cut is so weird. I thought it would be like a loose fitting Hawaiian shirt but it's not. There aren't enough buttons and it doesn't even button up to the top. I don't know who this shirt would look good on. I bought it because I liked the mushroom pattern but it's an ugly fit so not worth it.
1.0,Very cheap and did not roll. Had to throw away. Never used.
1.0,This was a Christmas gift to my girlfriend and this thing broke after 3 months.
1.0,"I tried to use these for a photo shoot, and they didn't work. They are to big and poor quality."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:19e6f1d2cbf64793a3b1f31f348750e]] These are just one thin piece of fabric and offer no protection for kids in school. They might protect bugs from flying into you mouth when running or something, but air/coughs/sneezes go right through. Even doubled up, these do not pass the candle test."
1.0,Doesn’t help with sun glare at all!
1.0,"In just 2 weeks of use, the paint started to come of, really bad quality, it was a gift for my Girlfriend and i`m really sad.<br /><br />Dont buy."
1.0,Not worth your money!
1.0,Worse than worthless! No “teeth” to tighten down. Slip off immediately. 🤦‍♀️😖🤬
1.0,I ordered this Sandler and received a completely different pair. I tried reaching out to the seller and they couldn’t understand all I wanted was the shoes I ordered.  I needed them for special event and was very disappointed...would never order again
1.0,Dont buy unless your neck is the size of a toothpick.
1.0,"Most coverups are one size fits all so i was excited to see size options in this particular style.  Unfortunately, a small fits like a large or extra large."
1.0,Beautiful but too small in midsection.
1.0,"While they aesthetically look great, they are not built well. First use of the big suitcase and both handles fell off. I see in other reviews other buyers had the same issue. I wasn't even lifting it high probably two feet in order to put it on the airline weight check. I was really surprised on how easy they came off. I would definitely not recommend."
1.0,"I wear size large, to be sure of fit I ordered X large, I was disappointed when It was too small."
1.0,cheap fabric. neck hole feels stretched. too big neck hole
1.0,"These are sized for little girls, not adult sized."
1.0,The sunglasses rims were in poor condition and some of the metal was bent.  The lens are no where near red.  Avoid.
1.0,Snap come undone too easily.
1.0,"Meh. I had to return them. Box was destroyed, the sole was used, looked “cheap”. I never leave bad reviews but this was a miss."
1.0,"Gloves were sell made, but were cut so small that I couldn't get my hands into them."
1.0,Product material is NOT quality.  Tie was damaged upon arrival... the thread on one of the dots was snagged- being one that was upmost center made it not wearable as the &#34;damage&#34; would be most noticeable.  The color is almost more orange-red as opposed to red.<br />Do NOT buy from seller MENDENG -- they do NOT even accept returns!  Left with an unwearable tie as well as need to find an appropriate tie for the upcoming occasion.
1.0,It’s way to big a waste of money
1.0,"only got to wear once and they shruck so bad I had to throw them away, not happy at all"
1.0,If I could give it one star I would. I order the largest size and it fit like an A cup. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,I do not recommend at all they do not stay together in your ear at all. One was broke when i got it.
1.0,The shorts do not have built in mesh briefs but that’s what the description said and what I wanted.
1.0,Looked so cute in the photo super bummed we never received the item.
1.0,"Wore this right after purchasing and sanitizing, and after a week the starfish part is all yellow. The rhinestones got cloudy too, dont buy it!!!"
1.0,First week wearing and metal already turning my toe black. Not worth the money.
1.0,After a couple week the color gone
1.0,They were not 8mm in size.. Sent picture showing the difference. I would appreciate feed back on this toy sized item
1.0,Very thin material and stains very easily
1.0,Item was much smaller and the color received does not match what I ordered at all.
1.0,"HORRIBLE!!!! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!! THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND SEE-THROUGH,  I ORDERED A 3X AND IT FIT MY NIECE WHO IS A SIZE 2!!  I AM MAD THAT I HAVE TO GVE IT A STAR!"
1.0,"Terrible quality.  Washed this and also the big brother matching set and the strings on the pants of both of them shredded. Talk about frustrating!  I had to cut the strings off of both pairs of pants, after detangling the string shreds from around every other article of clothing in my washing machine 🤬"
1.0,The day I received these I had to glue three rhinestones back on. Within a week of use I had fix another one. Although the magnet holds well the rest of the quality is lacking
1.0,The sword wasn't near the real thing. It was a knock off
1.0,I looked like I was ready to go out on the farm and pick up a calf. Not the look I was going for but maybe for someone else
1.0,The dress is adorable but it has a snag with a hole in it in the lower back area.
1.0,There was a tear in one of the zipper seams/pocket right out of the box.
1.0,The necklace came without a clasp! Dont waste your time on this item..
1.0,The dress looked nothing as descried and it was also way to large. Not worth the money and when retuned I was charged a fee for bad quality dress.
1.0,"Does not look anything like the picture they provided. Very thin. Not worth $8.99 as priced. Won't be able to hold any stocking stuffers, flops around & won't hang from the mantle very well. Its a sad sack."
1.0,They break easily when you bump into something
1.0,It's not true to size
1.0,Very tight fitting and runs small.
1.0,The wire supported brim was very poorly functioning. There was no substantial control of the structure. The hat is poorly suited for adjustment
1.0,"Se extravió y no consigo rastrearlo, al principio en mi lista de pedidos aparecía la información de que aparentemente estaba extraviado. Cuál es la onda? Que irresponsables"
1.0,Piece of crap! The smell was enough to get anyone high. So gross and we never even took it out of the bag. My 11 year old was beyond disappointed because he worked and saved his $ to buy it. Didn’t light up. Overall it was garbage and that’s where it ended up an hour after opening it.
1.0,*update* we received a replacement pair...the metal heart was missing on the left shoe...just not a good buy.***<br />My daughter was so excited to get these in the mail last night and put them on right away. They looked super cute on her but after wearing them for about 10 minutes the front part of the sandal snapped. Now they can't be worn at all she was heartbroken.
1.0,"I purchased this outfit so my daughter could have a different look to school on her birthday, cause they wear uniforms... It's made small and not well proportioned... It fits but the measurements are off... The pants are high waters... The suspenders are too long. Not a good buy, will request refund."
1.0,It's cute However the lace is fraying and it came way too small!
1.0,"The size of shirt is extremely small, the material looks cheap. I would hate to place in a dryer as I know it will shrink a lot.<br />I am still waiting on a refund and return label."
1.0,Too baggy had to get it taken in.
1.0,Missing a seal when it arrived. And it just leaks all the water out....  can't use it unless I buy a new bladder. But who wants to do that when it's supposed to be new.
1.0,It was broken when it arrived.
1.0,"This tie chain was shown as a $100 chain reduced to $13.00. It is barely worth $13.00.<br />It has a very cheesy feel to it , It is only finished on one side and the so called finished<br />side has scratches on it."
1.0,Completely see through and cheap material
1.0,"Bought this as a gift for my fiance, he loved it at first and a week later it wouldn't turn on or charge. Returning!"
1.0,Nope. I am a size 14 but ordered an XXL adjust to make sure there would be room for &#34;the girls&#34;. The top fits like a crop top and the bottoms are also too small. I'm not sure if I got something that was sized wrong or what but... nope.
1.0,"These are very pretty colors but they are a LOT smaller than other piercings. I couldn't get them to work,so unfortunetly I'm a bit diaspointed."
1.0,Scratched
1.0,"Not happy wrong color, and not fixed!"
1.0,About a week in school my daughter strap pop and it’s not like you could attach it back. So I had to get another book bag and lost out on money and A bag with this one.
1.0,"The fit is fine but I’m giving this item 1 star because the design is off center, but badly. I can’t wear this the way it is."
1.0,Wasn't what I expected. It looked much better in the photo then the one I received.
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it
1.0,These glasses did not seem to make any difference at all except to add a little blur since they are not perfectly ground.
1.0,Pants fit perfect the top wayyyy to small
1.0,Way too small. I even ordered a size up.
1.0,Bought this band because I wanted something that would last while looking a little more professional than the rubber watch bands. I was wrong. Lasted a little under two months and the band separated. Looks like back to the cheap looking but long lasting rubber like bands I go.
1.0,"If I could give them 0 stars,  i would! These were a COMPLETE disaster.  Not only did they run SUPER SMALL,  (I'm a L and i ordered a 2X, so what does that tell you?) but there were NO hooks on the overalls! How do you have over alls with no hooks?! The straps looked like they weren't finished been sewed on because the picture shows a double strap and mine had one flimsy one with no hooks on the end! I'm sending this crap back and will never shop from you again!"
1.0,"The bag arrived today.  It has a strong chemical odor and does not feel authentic.  For pebbled leather, it is stiff.  Even the booklet does not state the bag is made of leather, it is worded, &#34;crafted from fine material&#34;.  Feeling as though I didn't get what I thought I had ordered."
1.0,Too small and doesn't stick well
1.0,"This isn't an actual &#34;tri-fold&#34; wallet. It's a rather small billfold wallet that has an extra flap to make it appear to be tri-fold. Physically, this wallet is small and difficult to insert and take out credit cards (and similar sized IDs). The two slots for cash are rather small in size and don't open up well to make it easy to both put cash into them, nor remove cash from within. What's rather odd about the cash pockets is that they're deep; deeper than your typically sized currency. I suspect that if you have small hands and fingers, that this design might work well for you? For me, it's difficult to manipulate."
1.0,My item was broken I am very unsatisfied
1.0,TOO SMALL...I gave it away to my friend's 7 year old
1.0,This product is very soft and comfortable… BUT… the color does not match the description at all!! The pink is more like a pink with blue and grey speckles in it. Not flattering to me at all. I’m sure I would love it in a different color that was more accurate to what I was buying.
1.0,The fit is just too weird! The bra area are just two pieces of foam.I had to buy another one at the store. Disappointed!!
1.0,Cheap printing. Cheap material.
1.0,"Vheap, cheap, cheap! Dollar Store quality!"
1.0,My daughter wanted to order these as s gift for her sister. Upon arrival she was horribly disappointed. They are huge! You'd have to have a head the size of Mr Mackey off South Park for them to look even remotely okay. I don't see how these could ever have a real world application.
1.0,To large quality sucks
1.0,"These gloves barely fit an adult woman. Very tight and short in the fingers. Also, the bones are not aligned to the arm. They go up the inside of the arm then are printed on the side rather than fully opposite."
1.0,"While this might be good for a costume or other single use, mine came with unfinished edges and fabric fraying."
1.0,I'm sorry to say that the shoe didn't fit accordingly nor was it the way it was described very uncomfortable and product  material was very cheap Concidering everything else that was claimed sorry ;(((((((((
1.0,"This mask could not be made large enough to fit my 11YO daughter.  It isn't eligible to be returned, so we basically spent $10 on a mask for my daughter's American Girl dolls.<br /><br />Unless you have a head smaller than an 11YO girl I'd suggest you keep looking."
1.0,Cheap quality belt.  Save your money!
1.0,Your black band will be silver within a few weeks because it rubs right off starting under the magnetic clasp.
1.0,"It was simply a tube of material with no shape or support to enable it to be used as a face mask for covid or for dirt. Won't stay up without holding it, even with it folded over so the material is doubled up. The cost is the same as a 4-pack of gaiters that are made to be used as gaiters. Stick to ordering real gaiters, not someone trying to make a profit off the current situation. Bummer they didn't put any work into because I was willing to pay the extra for the cute material design."
1.0,I have used this slippers but they fold on the top & it's dangerous
1.0,Very light material and sizes run small. Returned & moving on.
1.0,Glasses came in broken.
1.0,This product is cut very small and cheap. It has no stretch at all and I'm not even big. I ordered a lg and normally I'm a medium. I would've send it back because the zipper broke as soon as I put one leg in it. I will never order from them again.
1.0,The quality was poor.
1.0,Did not stretch and the Large size was basically a  small .
1.0,Genuine leather?  Not  by my definition.  This is plastic coated leather. It looks like plastic and feels like plastic and smells like a sewer.  It came with a little sachet envelope inside.  I dont think its a  free gift but an attempt to deodorize this little stinker.  I had to open a window to air out the room where I opened it...  I also found it difficult to access the CC card slots.  It comes nicely packaged in a Yahoo printed gift box.<br />  I give them credit for a return label and a fast refund.  I appreciate that very much.
1.0,This broke after 2 days. The bow piece fell right off!
1.0,Very weak and doesn't stay locked.
1.0,bought these for my boyfriend. Sad to say that one pair ripped at the front on his first day wearing them. Very displeased. Wouldn't recommend. Update: another pair has ripped like the first one did. Where's my refund?
1.0,Headphones were placed incorrectly and it felt like I was listening to my music with 2 tin cans.
1.0,Thin digital camera print will not hold its shape .<br />Shipping is from China
1.0,I ordered a large and I couldn't even pull it on. The ribcage part is so tiny.
1.0,These slide off my feet. very uncomfortable. I have to keep adjusting them.I have purchased from other vendors and I've never had this issue before.
1.0,"Too tangled, never got it to lay flat as pictured.  Very disappointed as it was to have been a Christmas gift. There are no blue stones/shells so not quite as shown in the photo. It was pretty esp. if you like turquoise but the tangle issue was too big an issue to overlook. Item returned."
1.0,Didn't fit at all
1.0,This was super bad. I bought to have for nursing my daughter. It was loose fitting everywhere. Looked terrible. If I went size down it would be way too small.
1.0,Nice piece of jewelry. Very cute. But the stone in front of the cat fell off the second day after my wife wearer it.
1.0,"Heels disintegrate rapidly and eyelet ripped as soon as I tied them up. Poor craftsman ship and material. To expensive. If they would haved held up, I would have bought two."
1.0,Muy mal el acabado de las piezas. Están en muy mal estado.
1.0,I got this to wear to church and to parties. I took care to be gentle with it-- and the date wheel fell off. Disappointed
1.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up from what I usually wear which is a small.  I am short and I wear a size 5 or 6 pants and usually a small in underwear. I ordered a medium when I should have bought an xl.  I couldn't get the bottoms up past just above my knees and the shirt I couldn't get past my shoulders.  It's insanely small and barely stretches.  Also it's white not off white. If I was a tiny child sized person this would be really cute.  I am very sad it doesn't fit bc I would have really liked it.
1.0,Super cheep and poorly made
1.0,The clasp was missing in the necklace.
1.0,We’ll I was excited to try them on. But this is how I received them .

1.0,Super small and cheaply made.
1.0,"Product was not made strong, it was broken in shipment.  I returned it for refund"
1.0,Super small and the handles are miniscule
1.0,"This would only fit a very short woman (maybe 5' & under?)... someone much shorter than me.  I could barely get it over my head (I'm 5'6"", about 100 lbs.) & the other dress I just got through Amazon fits me perfectly & it is a small also.  I always wear a size small in dresses.  It hits me right before the knee which is fine but  the waist & the pockets are WAY higher than they're supposed to be!  I couldn't even wear this as a tunic.  The fit is just way too off!  What a disappointment!  And the waist area is very snug!"
1.0,"Sized incorrectly, 2 sizes too small.  The fabric feels more like polyester than cotton and linen"
1.0,too small and thin
1.0,It looked like a medium when I ordered a 1x
1.0,Very similar to picture although not exactly the same.  Runs about 3 sizes small
1.0,These sunglaases are a plastic piece of junk. Very cheaply made.
1.0,Interesting enough you actually can't see Itachi on it except for his head
1.0,Ordered according to my sister's measurements. Not even close.
1.0,The shirt was too small and the pants too big. I also thought the material was not soft and itchy.
1.0,"Not worth the money. I didn't have these on my shoes but 20 minutes and they broke. The heel came right through the &#34;protector&#34;. Don't waste any money on this product, it will fail you."
1.0,Very disappointed with this purchase. Not what I was expecting very sad the seller doesn’t allow you to return it. They must know it a not good quality product.
1.0,"If this is a genuine Michael Kors handbag, why did it arrive without a dust cover or tags???? VERY disappointed that I got a purse in a plastic sack. Not the quality I would expect for the price and not sure if this is even genuine."
1.0,It looks like a tablecloth.
1.0,I dont suggest this to anyone to have your baby wear this ... smells like chemicals and it is definitely made of cheap materials that is BAD for your health ...
1.0,what a mess - came smashed and wrinkled.  rolled up into a ball
1.0,Bad quality turn black in one day soooooo bad 😠👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
1.0,Only got to wear this once. Hand washed the dress and the water turned red instantly. Hung to dry and the red dye bled into the white dots.  Good thing I washed it separately or I would have had a load of ruined clothing. The seller should pull this item.
1.0,"Low quality, fabric is very thin and see through."
1.0,I am small but this small was equivalent to a large for me. Material was good tho
1.0,"SOOO sad, since I LOVED the look of it! Unfortunately, it simply wouldn’t tighten on the post."
1.0,cheap not worth it or the wait
1.0,"Ordered XL, and could not even get one arm and my head in the top of the dress.  RIDICULOUS."
1.0,"Shirt fit ok, but sleeves are more like a swoop vs with peaks like in picture. Plus it rolls up all around. Was very disappointed that I did not look like a bat for work Halloween day."
1.0,The stitches came out on the shoulder after wearing once . I know it’s cheap but damn didn’t even wash it yet !
1.0,It gave me horrible skin reaction!! I know i am allergic to latex and i am sure this doesn't contain latex or rubber..so i am a little curious !!
1.0,"Very poo quality, not as nice as it looks in pictures at all"
1.0,"Super thin, no where near the same thickness as original lenses so they wobble in the frame.  Lenses didn't fit well at all.  I had to squeeze and bend the frame to get them to stay in.  Don't bother with these, Revents are way better."
1.0,This is awful.... it's a shirt. Not even close to a dress
1.0,Never purchase! Waaaaaay too small.
1.0,POOR QUALITY! Had multiple seam holes
1.0,The glasses look great but they broke right away.  Super low quality!  Save your money and get a pair that won't break right away!
1.0,Tarnished and used looking.  Actually kind of creeped me out wondering if it had previously been used.
1.0,"Ordered 0-6 month it fits a 2 year old this was for my older sisters baby shower and something she was excited for and honestly was just a huge disappointment, the fabric quality isn't the best either. Fell apart rather quickly not worth your money at all"
1.0,My wife had me send this back.  An inside  zipper was missing the pull handle
1.0,I ordered an extra large and this fit like a small.
1.0,MATERIAL FEELS AND LOOKS CHEAP
1.0,"I ordered these to go in my sequined tennis shoes at my wedding and they are definitely yellow, not gold as pictured."
1.0,Had to return these. Way too small for my 2X daughter.
1.0,Huge even after reading reviews. Not full length.<br />More like weird length capris.
1.0,"Our daughter had a surprise party and this was a hit she was so excited.  She couldn't go a day without wearing it, but she took it off at night because our daughter didn't want to damage the necklace.  She loves it .....but......today is the 3rd day and my daughter is heart broken because the glass broke....She asked me if I could fix it and I had to say I can't fix her present....Sad thing is I was about to write a different more positive review, because it is so beautiful and the charms were great and the magnetic closer for us was great.  So now I struggling how to replace it.<br /><br />Original Review<br />Oh my goodness this is so cute!  We are in the process of moving so we didn't want to buy anything huge for our daughter's 8th birthday.  This is better in person.  I don't know how well it work right now since she hasn't seen it and won't until next month.  It came in a nice box with a pouch inside that had 3 separate pouch that held the jewels, charms, and the last had the locket and chain.  She is going to be so excited....I hope I can wait until her birthday!!!  Hopefully the magnet works great."
1.0,"It fits okay. Just a disappointing purchase. The picture shown makes the shirt look really cute. In person it is not. It’s boxy, and very small. The decal is cheap and tacky looking. Really a waste of money."
1.0,Doesn't fit true to size. Too large
1.0,"Idk why I bought this to begin with, I think it was becasue it was a dollar. It doesn't fit right and looks cheap, well what did you expect for a dollar.lol"
1.0,"Soft suede and warm BUT do not work on any touchscreens, which render them useless to me. I needed them to use during my long commute in freezing weather - continuously on iPhone passing the time. Had to buy different brand ultimately"
1.0,It broke the first day I had it. It's still cute but it won't stay closed.
1.0,Very disappointed! Worn them one day and they turned black! Had to throw them away! Waste of money!
1.0,Sent to me damaged and it’s crochet not lace and the size chart is off.  I ordered up and it was too big! Sending it back.

1.0,Dull & cheap look.

1.0,I couldn’t get my foot through the opening.
1.0,Arrived broken In half and i cannot return or replace

1.0,"Too small, almost children's sized."
1.0,"When I opened the package and pulled out this shirt, my jaw dropped. I ordered an XL. The tag says XL, but it looks like it was made for a little girl it's so tiny. The material is not a thermal knit, it's a very cheap tshirt material. This was a huge disappointment and will be sent back."
1.0,Nose piece broke after only wearing them for a few hours. The ear piece is the wrong color Don't waste your money one this.
1.0,"Did not like, did not fit, would not order again."
1.0,Terrible lining. Bunches up and sticks to itself. Near impossible for kids to get their fingers in. Waste of money.
1.0,Gave away to Good Will
1.0,"Fit is poor, awkward, and did not flatter...the tops hung weird. I got an xs and am 5'8.5&#34; and 120"
1.0,Poor quality. Not true to size. I wear a size 12 bought an XL fits more like a small.
1.0,"Don’t buy it , it’s nothing like in the picture, cheap made."
1.0,Ridiculous they came in uneven.  I live overseas serving and it’s a waste for me to send back as a service member.  They are nice looking but look ridiculous so I need to try these!
1.0,"Bought and returned b/c I didn't like the size, they charged $15 for shipping!!! What a rip off. Not buying again. Also, my friend has had one for a year now, and the leather finish chips off!"
1.0,Looks like it’s worth five dollars. Makes me scared to order clothes online now.
1.0,I bought my usual size and it runs very small. The cut is very short and no elastic on the leg to keep short in place.
1.0,"The charms from this company are not the quality they look like in the pictures that are presented.  It's not glossy and new looking. It honestly looks like they've seen a lot of wear.  I have purchased 3 from them and they just showed up in time for christmas.  This was a big mistake, as this one in particular was broken.  The little &#34;circle&#34; you see that connects the &#34;mother&#34; to the actual piece that fits on the bracelet, was absent.  So the mother piece, showed up as 2 separate pieces that are unable to be fixed.  I am pretty devastated due to time constraints and would only purchase something from this company again if I had a lot of time or was short on cash.<br /><br />In being to busy and trying to get more for my money, these look like you took the cheap route out.  I'll most likely by from a solid company from now on or a jewelry store themselves and just pay the big fee."
1.0,one of the slippers are torn at the seam.  Not happy with purchase.
1.0,I was so disappointed 😞 in my purchase because there was no way in the world that I was strong enough to get those socks on. I even took them to my husband and asked to help me but he was no help at all even though he tried. Unfortunately I was unable to return them. Maybe I can gift them to an acquaintance for Christmas or Halloween.
1.0,broken when iy arrived. cheap cheap cheap
1.0,TERRIBLE! BROKE AFTER THE FIRST USE!!!!!  I was on vacation so it left me without sunglasses for the entire trip.  I bought two pairs to be safe and they BOTH broke!!

1.0,Material was very thin and not flowing as was displayed in the pictures.
1.0,Mal empacando y tardo dos meses en llegar
1.0,Very cute bag but ripped after a week of using it. Could be user error but the stitching is very weak and ripped very easily.
1.0,unable to view at a distance with these. I can only use them for up close reading - not what I wanted.
1.0,The lace? Ripped. The fit? Unflattering. I tried to return this but I was symptomatic and couldn’t get the return done in time. This is extremely poorly made and I was very disappointed with my purchase. There’s a reason it’s cheaply priced.
1.0,"The beads are nice, but the bracelet keeps coming undone while wearing, and beads are easily lost."
1.0,"Awful quality fabric and sewing, right size but fit is so wrong. Returned."
1.0,The battery pack didn’t work so I had to return it.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. Very cheap, low quality necklace. The clasp gets stuck open, meaning it occasionally comes unclasped without my noticing. The bird is so tiny you cant tell what it is unless you're close. Not worth the return costs, but I wouldn't buy another one."
1.0,Did not fit as a XL at all! Even bought a size up. Had to return it.
1.0,The belt was poorly stitched. I had to sew it because there wasn’t enough time to return it. It was a gift.
1.0,Was five but shot glasses didn't fit and kept falling out and such cheap plastic that it cracked when it fell.
1.0,The bladeof skate in the photo looks like it has cristals on it. But it's just gritters that put on by glue.<br />And it's tiny than I expected.This price is too expencive for this.
1.0,Snaps come off super easy.
1.0,product received is very thick and difficult to breathe with filter installed.
1.0,The size too small 😌
1.0,"These Pants are made for ladies with thin calves. The size medium fit fine everywhere except the calves, right where the ties are. They were so tight on the lower legs that I could barely pull them on or off. I'm 5'9 and 136 lbs."
1.0,Plastic string that holds the lens to the frame was lose. Made the lenses very uneven.
1.0,Smelled bad.. flimsy no structure
1.0,Never had I had such an unpleasant purchase. First of all I bought 2 dresses. I received two different sizes although I ordered the same size. The dresses were not as described. They were very poorly made and the sizes were way off. I contacted the seller to return the items and a refund. Although they agreed to the return it cost $44 to return the merchandise. Since I purchased the dresses for less an price to return I'm stuck with two dresses that are like useless tags. I am very disappointed after waiting a month to get my order.
1.0,The dress is not as described.  It is cheap material and very unflattering around the waist due to the pockets.<br />It is VERY long.<br />Do not waste your money.<br />It is not sexy.<br />It is not an evening/cocktail dress.
1.0,Fell apart after 2.5 weeks. Returned.
1.0,Mask is for a small face. The nose wire is very low and cannot be adjusted to fit the bridge of the nose.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product. Color indicates black, but it is more of a dark blue. The fabric is very cheap and the color is splotchy. Also the length is shorter than indicated on the description"
1.0,It broke the first day I got it not happy at all
1.0,Purchased this to wear to my stepsons wedding. Had to return due to not fitting. Do your homework. This was shipped from China and cost me $44.00 to return and no telling how long it will take to get refunded.
1.0,I’m wearing the mask for the first time for my flight and it seriously feels like it is smothering me. Constantly being sucked into my nose and mouth. Really regretting bringing this mask for a full flight!
1.0,se devolvio porque no le quedo
1.0,I am not satisfied with the product on the website show a photo and get me another mode
1.0,"Haven't had these long when first the left pearl fell off. I was lucky and found it, do I was able to try and glue it back on. Then yesterday I just happened to reach to and from and the right one had lost it's pearl and I can't find it, so these are basically a waste of money."
1.0,"Although arrived the NEXT DAY, I was really disappointed in the proportion of the caricature of the face. While the facial features are supposed to be exaggerated, they were too much so, probably because the mask was too big to begin with. A smaller sized mask would have been better. The strings that go around the ears were already tied in a knot to shorten but still too big."
1.0,Poor quality. After the first day wearing it the neck area all pulled and looks super old already. Too bad it is just a day pass the return time. Very disappointed of the poor quality.
1.0,"Está descolorido, la tela perdió color en la parte de arriba"
1.0,"Crotch of pants ripped out the 1st time my son wore them, and the buttons came off the Jacket & vest. We even bought a size larger to make sure it wasn't tight, but the material was just very cheap."
1.0,It doesn't work.  I have tried on various pieces of sterling silver jewelry. Not worth it.  I bought two of these. What a waste of money.
1.0,Junk!!!
1.0,"The size is not XL, it's more like a Tall MEDIUM. I returned them the next day."
1.0,Looked very
1.0,"I would rate this 0 if I could. I should have bought this closer to the date I needed it as the return window has closed..... The zipper on this dress is trash.... I had an ordination to attend today, my brother became a priest, the church was FULL and I was in the front row.... Then I sneezed. And the zipper popped open. And there I was in all my glory from neck to butt Crack in the middle of church. The dress was not tight on me at all there was no stress on the zipper. Never again."
1.0,"it runs small. When I tried it on it pulled on my neck and it was painful to wear it, so I am unable to wear the dress. I contacted the seller to try and return the dress, but I still haven't heard back, and its been a few days."
1.0,"These would fit an elementary school student, not a teen."
1.0,"Zero stars.  Watch looks nice,  but I can hardly call it a watch if it can't tell time.  Battery was dead before I opened the box. Heads up: for a refund you'll have to pay to ship it back."
1.0,"I purchased a two pack and it was advertised as a two pack. However, I only received one. I went through the other reviews and this seems to be a common problem."
1.0,The top has this extra slouchy fabric that looks fine in the Amazon pics but is so weird in person. Returning. Just looks off.<br />Fabric was surprisingly fine. Not great but ok.<br />I had the white in a medium. Returned
1.0,Fitting was off.
1.0,"After one wash the white turned pink, even though I followed washing directions"
1.0,The bracelet fell apart as soon as I put it on. Tiny beads went everywhere. Not well made.
1.0,"I had to double check that I wasn't missing a piece. It's COMPLETELY see through, and everything is clearly visible. I'm beyond angry. Would give less than 0 stars if I could. I got a small and it was WAAAY too big"
1.0,"After 1 wash the threads separated on one of the legs, trying to contact amazon now to replace or refund. it is 4 days past the return date."
1.0,Very pretty but broke as soon as I put it on.  Won't buy these cuff earrings again!!  Should be a regular post earring
1.0,The metal was thin so it wouldn't clip on. On would give it 0 starts ifnincoild I just had to toss it in the trash.
1.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6 / ordered a large in multicolor-2<br /><br />See through, poorly fitted elastic so it bunches up in the front"
1.0,"Ummm these did not rise high and they fit like high waters. Not as pictured. They fit my width, but not my length. And I have short legs.."
1.0,I ordered two sizes up in order to make sure it fit and it did not!
1.0,I ordered the socks in the photo and pink were sent. I cant returned them because went as a gift.<br />Disappointed.
1.0,It is a clear colorless glass instead of a blue stone
1.0,Don’t know why other people are complaining they are too long mine are only 3inches long. The pic shows long ones. Buyer beware these do do match the pic.
1.0,Two of the three leggings had wholes in the back. Very disappointed in the leggings.
1.0,"I purchased this pin along with photo re-sizing software to avoid a trip to Walgreens or another photo center. No software card in package and no online link to complete the process at home. The pin will hold up for the day but there in no adhesive for either the picture or the picture cover. It was inexpensive, so as the saying goes ”you get what you pay for”!"
1.0,Just waste if time and money
1.0,Broke while trying it on.
1.0,"Cute, soft tank. However, after a couple wears/washes, it REALLY stretches out.  Now I can only wear with another tank underneath. But I don’t because the shape is no longer flattering."
1.0,Wore item first day and it snagged on a cart in the lab. Caused a huge hole in the material. Poor quality. Disappointing product. Material is too thin and of poor quality. Very sad because the color is perfect too. Very disappointed and material needs adjustment. Would prefer my money back as this happened first day of wearing it in the lab
1.0,Overall quality of material is cheap jersey feel.
1.0,These where not silkys at all they felt cheap I would not recommend these for wavers you'll be dumb to purchase this.
1.0,runs small I will return
1.0,Tight and low in bust area and material feels like P jamas  It is not long and wavy as in the picture.  Quite deiceiving!!!!!
1.0,Sizing is entirely off. This looked like a shirt on me and I wear short dresses! This didn't cover my assets standing up much less sitting down.
1.0,"Two sizes two small, and I even ordered up a size. Also had a big run in the arm."
1.0,JUNK!!!!
1.0,"This shirt looks OK but there is too much material in the back of the shoulders.  Because of the extra material, the shoulders are a little pointy even when your arms are hanging straight down - raise your arms at all, or shrug a little, and the points become very pronounced.  It looks really goofy and is not like any other shirt I own.  It's like the manufacturer didn't even bother to have someone wear it.<br /><br />The material is on the thick side and is rough/coarse.  Doesn't bother me that much, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />Other than the pointy shoulders, the shirt looks pretty cool.<br /><br />But because the pointy shoulders look so ridiculous, I'm giving this shirt to Goodwill."
1.0,If you need a large order a medium
1.0,The clip on the back is missing
1.0,Runs WAY too small
1.0,I didn't receive the pendant. Only the bracelet and the pyramid.
1.0,Dark spots
1.0,"2nd pair I’ve bought. First pair are the purple, and they’re amazing. This time I got black and they are see-through. Completely see through when you bend over. Order at your own risk."
1.0,If you are wanting white this is NOT it’s ivory<br />Also rolled up in a ball inside a plastic bag so many wrinkles don’t ever see myself getting them all out arm’s also super tight…sending it back
1.0,I Received the ankle bracelet it broke last night I was able fix but I am very disappointed Thanks
1.0,"where is my stuff,ordered 5th june"
1.0,Donated to charity
1.0,[[VIDEOID:70c38ad6b59bc6adc636e83cb354e57a]] Do not buy! Cheapest looking thing. I don't even think it's a real swimsuit. It's like a Halloween costume or something. Stay away!
1.0,"Totally different colors!, These are brown and leopard! Didn’t like them at all"
1.0,0the wires that make up the bracelets is not even close to fitting normal size wrists much less getting it over your hand
1.0,"1 star only because it does what it promises of keeping my dress socks from drooping.<br /><br />The biggest problem I encountered was the cheap plating on the clips and buckle. After about a WEEK of daily use the plating started to tarnish which, for me, caused my skin to get really irritated. The skin irritation could be just me, but that doesn't mean that the tarnishing should be accepted."
1.0,"this ring is poorly made, they might as well not put any diamonds in rather than put the tiny pin head stones in there.  the ruby is extremely cloudy, very low quality, mediocre cut at best, the ring has seams and obvious evidence of soldering/welding on the outside.  this seller has posted many quality items in the past, i have even purchased one or two, but this ring is not one of them, horrible item not as described in photo."
1.0,It broke the first day I wore it. Would NOT recommend.
1.0,"If you are not a 4 year old, don't buy this! I followed the reviews and went 2 sizes up, and I still can't even get it on. I'm not that big, just had a baby so I wanted some support on my tummy during my workouts. I have a pretty long torso and this won't even come close to being long enough.  Dang it!"
1.0,Unless you have large alien hands this glove will be excessively too long in the fingers.
1.0,"I ordered this for my twin boys and just after one use, they informed me that they both had holes in the crotch area.<br />Do not waste your time and money!"
1.0,"Item fits like boot cut costume pants. The material is made poorly, I suppose I can save them for Halloween.<br /><br />Absolutely less than impressed, I wouldn’t buy these again."
1.0,Too static. Not flowy like the pictures.
1.0,"The picture made this shirt look so flattering on but everything about it is wrong. The material is so thin and see through, the sleeves are too tight, and it does not hang loosely like the picture depicts.<br />I am 5' 2""/155 lbs.- I always order a large and usually don't have an issue... this shirt is so tight.<br />I don't like this shirt and do not recommend."
1.0,I ordered up a size and it was still too small from the crotch to my shoulder.  Material was so thin it was see-through and it was packaged in a way that it was so wrinkled I don't think it would smooth even after washing and ironing.  Sent it back!
1.0,"I thought this was exactly what I was looking for, not too tight in the body and some support up top. However , I ordered a size up so that it would be a bit looser in the body and the fit was all wrong. The body part was ok I guess but the boob part was huge and I am a c cup. I tried to return it but I would have to pay for shipping so I'm not sure what I am goint o do with it. Also it is VERY thin, it looks and feels very cheap."
1.0,Poorly made the stitching at the waist is all over the place
1.0,"Loved the band - broke once (pin fell out - and not one that I had tampered with) - replaced the pin, and it broke again. Returned"
1.0,"I purchased the red dress it nothing near to the color red, the one I received was more like orange and Poor quality for the price I thought it would be a little better the material is see threw I wouldn’t buy it again"
1.0,Bad quality very ship not elegant at all
1.0,"This ring is pretty, but don’t let that fool you.<br />The stone fell out as you can see. This is the 2nd ring I have purchased from this company & both stones have fell out. It doesn’t seem like they are set tightly. Then, all of a sudden you notice, there is no stone in the ring . 🙁<br />This happened within a couple of months after purchasing."
1.0,I wish I could write a review the box was empty when delivered
1.0,"La sandalia le quedaron pequeñas, fui yo que las escogí muy pequeñas, pero la mamá se las envió para cambiar, no he recibido respuesta."
1.0,"These don’t shouldn’t be labeled as compression socks, they certainly don’t do anything.  I work as a vet tech and wanted a compression sock that wasn’t as high but this did nothing.  It was like I was wearing my normal socks.  Plus the fit sucks.  I wear a size 8 in women’s shoes and the s/m was still too big.  The heel came up to my ankle.  Maybe if the sizing was better.  Just get normal compression socks and don’t waste your money and they are just as hot as my compression socks anyway.  Not happy"
1.0,I did not like the way the bottom fit. Too loose. Too much skirt.
1.0,Finger turned green after 8 hours of wear
1.0,Its definately not 100% cotton. It's like wearing a tarp. I've tried air drying but still needs majorly ironed. The stitching is coming unraveled all over and it had dirt stains on it when I opened. DO. NOT. BUY.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this sport jug.  My entire family has Bubba cups and love them.  I have been able to have cold water for nearly 24 hours in my cup so I assumed that the larger jugs would work great as well.  I knew that due to their size the water wouldn't stay cold as long but I figured my ice wouldn't melt and my water start to warm in as little as 20 minutes.  This is without even taking the jug outside.  Unfortunately, I am in deep with two 48 ounce jugs and two 72 ounce jugs.  Some reviewers stated that the jugs were hit or miss related to the placement of the insulation between the layers so I wanted to give all the products the benefit of the doubt.  I tried all four jugs several times but they all couldn't keep my water cool for more than an hour despite how much ice I put in the container."
1.0,It doesn’t look like the image at all. A little lose and not the kind of fabric I thought it would be.
1.0,Too small for my size XXL! The Manufacturer put wrong size. So disappointed.
1.0,Did not arrive when it was to be delivered. Did respond to question concerning delivery...however product was not even close to the colors or appearance of the pictures. would not recommend this product.
1.0,This shirt is not cute in person and it's see through/cheap.
1.0,Do not stick very good a pain would not buy again
1.0,Too large and could not return
1.0,absolutely no arch support and what little sole there is seems misshapen - flimsy- waste of money
1.0,"I purchased these socks a few weeks ago and though they are nice and soft, they don’t stay put. They constantly slip off my heal.  Today  I threw away a dozen of these socks. I’ve been wearing low socks like these for years, and these are by far the worst."
1.0,I ordered X-Large in which I normally do and fits. This was way too small
1.0,It has a fishy smell to the tutu
1.0,"My handle spins around intead of staying in place, maing it hard to hild on to in the wind. Also, the handle pops off, so its very annoyong. Would not buy again."
1.0,"Ugh. The longer hanging pair was such bad quality. One of them came broken, but I thought maybe it was shipping. Then while handling the other one of the same pair it broke in the same way, I was barely touching them! Terrible quality"
1.0,I just now got it out to wear and there is a brown spot on the back of the dress. It is past time to return it so I'm stuck with a dress I cant wear so be sure to look at yours
1.0,This product is not worth the money. Save the money.
1.0,Was too little
1.0,The material is horrible. I bought a black one from a different seller and it was lovely.
1.0,Does not fit in any way. It’s like the top was sewn for a 300 lb person and the bottom half sewn for a 75 lb person.
1.0,Dors look good as In the picture Ankle too wide.
1.0,Chain scratchy and rough. Wouldn't lay flat. Stones fell out just touchng it. Almost carnival quality. Returned immediately. Found two more stone after I sent back. Pretty design but junk.  Look for something else.
1.0,"Not at all what I received, although correctly branded - really disappointed! Poorly lined, and I don't even see what I received from the company on their product page. Don't buy - you will get a poor quality just-off version. I was really looking forward to this product from the reviews, too! A shame."
1.0,Much smaller than they appear
1.0,"Unfortunately the quality was not as great as the price. I literally wore them once, wash them once and they started falling apart at the seams. No one responded when I asked for a replacement and I was very unhappy with this purchase overall.."
1.0,They are beautiful but the stem and ball at the end are very big. I can't even get it in the piercing
1.0,Not silver. It caused my ear infected. Bad quality. The stone does not rest among the metal well. It went to the trash can. Never buy jewelry online anymore.
1.0,"Very heavy skirt. Read all the reviews and ordered size up M. I wear size 26-<br />27 jeans or 2-4. The medium was huge. But even if it weren’t so big, I’d still return it because the combo of material and lining made this skirt super heavy. This is not your cute winter mini. It will bulk you up."
1.0,Does not stay on :(
1.0,"Considering the price I shouldn't expect much, but this skirt smelled like a bag of fish. It was awful. I couldn't wear it."
1.0,It was cute but the print if the dinosaurs were upside down!
1.0,My ring has broken a month into having it. Not happy
1.0,The watch looks good but the wrist band only last 2 weeks. Very desapointed I couldn't used because there is no way to found a replacement.
1.0,It broke the first time I wore it in public.
1.0,"I am an avid walker in my 60’s.  Wore one pair of these once, went to wear them again and saw they were full of small holes….not in the seams like the fabric itself is rotting.  I returned them and bought capri yoga pants in a better quality."
1.0,Weird material and way too big for a childs face. Too big for an adults face. Very poorly made
1.0,"Aside from being Super Duper UGLY, it seems that this top was not even made for a human. It was odd, misshapen, ugly and nothing like the picture."
1.0,Shut up with battery not working but cute if it did work
1.0,Stone fell out within 24 hours
1.0,Terrible fit and sew.
1.0,"One leg was clearly shorter than the other, visibly noticeable and cannot be worn. Material is really soft but super thin, good for lounging around the house, definitely not for working out."
1.0,Was not what I ordered they did not have hoods and were completly different shirts my son liked them so I kept them but I really needed hooded light weight sweatshirts was very disappointed.
1.0,Color was muted and for was tight no give
1.0,"The watch is old and needs to be modernized and updated, the picture looks more better than the actual product and polka dot box a VIRUS came with the product!!!"
1.0,SO I thought these were going to hold up and be great but boy was I wrong! They are cheaply made and broke like a week after having them. These are NOT worth the money so don't bother with them!
1.0,The picture looks nothing like the real tank. It’s a light green and not as soft and relaxed as the picture shows. Only keeping because I don’t have time to return. The picture is not edited that I posted.
1.0,This is terrible quality. The pin is so flimsy it bent just going through a thin shirt. Really awful. Do not buy.
1.0,"I bought these in the past and they were pretty bad quality.  However, they weren't terrible for the price.  Unfortunately, I misplaced them.  So, I ordered a new pair.  This pair is worse quality.  It was bent in the package.  I wouldn't buy these for $1.  These are rip-off products.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!  Go to a dumpster behind a dollar store to find better quality."
1.0,"Bad quality control, grey leggings material was damaged. Will return"
1.0,"Absolutely awful. Did not fit, too small and very unflattering. I’m 5’4”, 135lbs, usually a size 4/6."
1.0,Shrunk after one wash and I bought it oversized and it quickly became a crop top
1.0,"Broke the first day I wore them. Love the look, but extremely disappointed. Took barely a tug to break"
1.0,The package came with a jewelry box in it but the box was empty! Will be asking for refund
1.0,Will never buy these again. Not true to my size.
1.0,Whatever process was used isn’t right. Got mine like this and it’s pretty bad.
1.0,The smell when opening this package was horrible.<br />Very strong chemical smell!!!
1.0,"The arm broke off the second day, i didnt even get a chance to wear them"
1.0,The quality of the fabric is cheap.
1.0,Way smaller than the size it’s suppose 2 be
1.0,On one of the stays the stitching at the Y ripped out / broke the first day I wore it. The other one is already starting to rip out as well.
1.0,"Not only too small, the fabric was thin enough to read a paper through it - very poor quality!!"
1.0,Colors weren't very clear and they break easily
1.0,The sizing is totally misleading.  It does not even come close to being  large enough for an adult.  I usually wear the size 7.5 USA or 38.  Do not order these!! I
1.0,"Looks, NOTHING LIKE THE PIC, more like sausage casing. I'm an XS and i got a S and it fit like an XXXS."
1.0,The needle was already turned on my earrings when I receive them in the mail smh.
1.0,"The chain it changed the color to the black, I don’t what happen , am really like it but the damaged the colors."
1.0,Was super cheap. The material should be considered paper. I am extremely disappointed. I followed the size chart and this crap still<br />Fit like a bib!
1.0,Very expensive for an unknwon brand the shipping cost made it very expensive and does not wrth the money y paid.
1.0,"I am a big guy, so I'm used to some clothes fitting tight, in particular those made with wicking materials. With that in mind, I ordered a 4X while my usual size is 3X. This shirt was small everywhere. Sleeves only came to my forearms, waste came to the middle of my belly. The quality of the shirt was good, so maybe this was just sized wrong. Either way, I can't give it a good score."
1.0,"Received WOMEN'S size 10... ordered TODDLER size 10, which is what was advertised.<br /><br />This listing needs to updated. Pretty disappointing."
1.0,"The design peeled off of the back before the first wash. My son was super excited to get this sweatshirt, only to be disappointed a day or two later when it started falling apart.<br /><br />After the first wash, the front triforce also started to peel. It's a pretty nice sweatshirt, too bad the screen printing is not."
1.0,"I have no idea if i like this hat since I bought two of these for my kids over three weeks ago. It said, ships in 2 days, although that may be true, it takes a month after that. I really wish THAT was noted before purchasing. So now my kids have a gift not coming until the new year even though I ordered it the first few days of December. So far, not pleased. I sure hope the quality is good enough to make it worth the wait."
1.0,Crappy. Broke two days after
1.0,This went into the garbage seconds after it arrived…This is made in china.
1.0,To thick in toe areas can’t fit toes in show without them being smashed.
1.0,cheap cheap cheap so dont like it
1.0,My daughter was so happy - then 3 days later it broke. Just snapped right in half. Don't waste your money or get your loved ones hopes up.
1.0,I am a person with a booty and thick thighs and they fit super nice until I get to my butt…then it’s like trying to fit into lefties that are 4 sizes too small.
1.0,Pants are way too small in the crotch and butt area
1.0,"Zipper is in the back. They are difficult to close because you cannot see it. When I finally had my husband seal them for me, they ripped even though I still had plenty of room. Waste of money. And poor quality."
1.0,These ear climbers did not clamp on easily nor would they stay clamped on.
1.0,"They were supposed to be cotton. The fabric was a mystery substance. So tight even the dog's feet were to big for them. Have no way to return them, in managed care. Don't waste your money"
1.0,"Terrible!!!!! I bought 4 of them, 1the ball was stripped and the other 3 the glitter crumbled off."
1.0,"Not a very good face mask, I would not buy it again"
1.0,"Arrived broken, need to return."
1.0,I would have loved this but the manufacturing is poor.  The pin doesn't go through one of the sides.  The hole doesn't go all the way through the end of the band to connect to the watch.
1.0,"Earrings arrived broken, the top stone on one of them was cracked and fell off, so they were then uneven. That cracked stone was loose in the bag, so I'm assuming it was damaged in shipment. Very disappointing! They are beautiful earrings otherwise.  I didnt bother returning them since they were economically priced to start."
1.0,"HUGE, I cant even make this look good, it is a sack with absolutely no shape"
1.0,"Save your money, armholes tiny and fabric ruffle is not as it appears,  not enough fabric to even ruffle. Look much better in picture than in person."
1.0,Rhinestones were falling off while I was trying on VERY poor quality
1.0,"About a month after having these, and not a lot of use, the speakers inside the hat came loose.  Not worth the money."
1.0,Way to big gave it away
1.0,Just an awkward fit in the shorts and length of the jacket ... it looked child like.
1.0,"Super pequeño, para una niña"
1.0,was waaaaayyyy to big. I am so sad I had to give it away. Material was thin but nice. blouse was the style I wanted but just too too big
1.0,Bought this for my daughter. Received item quickly but unfortunately it did not light up. I will be returning it. First time I will be returning anything I've gotten from Amazon but apparently I can take it to the local Kohl's without having to pack or print any labels.
1.0,Not a good product.  Extra chain is on wrong side so it won't fit around anyone's neck.  Its like 8 inches long.
1.0,Washed for first time and the letters came off!
1.0,Horrible don’t buy it ripped the first time I used it!
1.0,"Doesn't work, not even a month of wearing in the pool water started going inside the goggles."
1.0,Really cheap metal cheap clasp. Wish I never bought it.
1.0,kind of cheap looking poly material.  it fits well but after washing it the end threads were totally destroyed.
1.0,I really hate these! they ride up almost instantly and aren't long enough to really pull back down once they do ride up.
1.0,"Ugly and ran in size huge, when I ordered a size small"
1.0,"The quality is too bad what I received doesn’t worth more than $2.00. So be careful before placing your order, because what you see in the picture is completely different."
1.0,The dress was not like the picture and the size is about 2 sizes off...
1.0,"This is a joke, it doesn’t fit the ear and it won’t stay."
1.0,"This would be such a cute piece of jewelry if it had came as pictured. Instead, it came crooked. Not worth 10 dollars."
1.0,Fell apart in a week
1.0,Very cheaply made and fits bad
1.0,"Item NOT as pictured. Wrong verbiage. Said US Army, not Army Strong as pictured. Also, edges NOT scalloped."
1.0,"The earrings are beautiful, the colors, the materials are good. The only downsize is that the hook broke the first time I tried to wear them."
1.0,I don't like the flimsy material it's made out of.  Super stretchy and may be ok for summer months but it's way to thin of material for winter wear.
1.0,The color was faded. There were fade lines running down the entire dress.
1.0,"These bands are not adjustable and VERY loose, even the small size! They also come apart very easily. Steer clear!"
1.0,They are not worth the price I had to pay. Do not buy
1.0,It broke from the weight of a golf umbrella after 3 uses.
1.0,This pretty blue shirt has a big flaw - a white thread woven in - right in the middle of the front.
1.0,Lavender color painted on and quickly begins to peel off.
1.0,"A waste of money - the bag does not have built-n batteries.  Therefore, the &#34;charging&#34; feature only works if you have a battery pack that you place inside the bag.  Just like before.<br /><br />The wheels also run very poorly - the bag twists and turns on many surfaces when you are trying to walk in a straight line.  Don't buy one."
1.0,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap T-Shirt"
1.0,These mittens are not sized appropriately. I ordered the 2-3 for my daughter who is 3 years old and they were huge. They are very difficult to get on and kept coming off of her hands. I will be returning these.
1.0,Started pulling within hours of first wear. I thought they would last a little longer than that 😠
1.0,"It took forever to arrive.  It is see through.  It runs small.  I am going to attempt to return it, we'll see how that goes.  I would not recommend this product,"
1.0,Totally garbage
1.0,Beautiful necklace but arrived broken in several places......so broken that someone had to have seen it when it was packed to ship.....very disappointed.
1.0,"Extremely disappointing!  Looked so good in the picture.  Small, flimsy and cheaply made.  Don't expect it to hold up or be used again.  Half as much as it cost to return it so won't throw good money after bad.  Truly a pathetic purchase on my part!  Will be more discriminating in the future."
1.0,glasses are too small to protect your eyes from the wind. big gap around the top lets wind in. my cheap convenance store sunglasses are better.
1.0,This belt smelled so strong (musty/moldy).  I tried scrubbing it and also set it out in the sun.  Could not get rid of the smell.  Returned the belt.
1.0,Very small poor quality
1.0,How can a winter jacket NOT have anything to hold it closed. Can you image walking in the snow with your jacket open?
1.0,I bought these shoes for my 3 yo daughter and the velcro does not stick! I am very disappointed in them I had much higher standards coming from adidas and bought my son a similar pair when he was the same age which did not have this issue.
1.0,Way to small.like tissie paper
1.0,After a couple of months it stop working.
1.0,"The tunic is a weird length on me...its in between a tunic and a dress. Its really to short to wear as a dress to work but really to long to wear with leggings or tights and it look right. Also I washed on gentle cycle with cold water and hung to dry and it still shrunk up, not length but it got SUPER tight in the chest/belly area.I ended up giving this to a 10 year old to wear as a dress But I wish I would have returned it."
1.0,I wanted to like this so bad. The fit was perfect. Unfortunately it came without a back button. No button in the bag or anything. Came defective so now I have to repair it in order to wear it. More cost & work for something so simple
1.0,Real cheaply made
1.0,Super cheaply made and very overpriced
1.0,"After just a few days, this broke.  Would love to return, but past return date.  Looks beautiful, hate that it broke."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY! The adjustment clip for the right joy con came broken and I basically had to pry my joy cons out of both clips, the release button wouldn't work. On top of that, the Amazon return/replace feature is unavailable for this product."
1.0,It doesn't look anything like the way the girl modeled.  I feel like i work at target<br />I bought one in size small and another large for my girl.
1.0,Estan bonitos pero de mala calidad
1.0,This is/was a cute dress... however it ripped immediately after putting it on.  It ripped right down the back. Way too thin and cheaply made.
1.0,"Both have a crack on them , disappointed."
1.0,Way too small. I normally wear an XL and bought it. The seller (from China) would only give me partial money back or send me another larger one. I opted for trying a 2XL and it was STILL too small. Very disappointed!
1.0,"Package of two only contained 1. Material stiff, unlike cotton."
1.0,Cute. The necklace and flip flop turned.. earrings didn't. Wish the necklace and flip flop were better quality.
1.0,Totally plastic
1.0,Didn't survive the first trip through the washing machine. The deal started peeling before I even hung it up to dry.
1.0,The material feels and Looks nothing like the picture. I will be returning this item.
1.0,"I like the pattern in these socks.<br />Aside from that, there were way more things I really, really, disliked.<br />There was a ""seam"" in the pattern on both the inside and outside of each sock, without there actually being a sewn seam. It was like the front and back didn't line up, and this ""seam"" wasn't even centered at a halfway point so it was super obvious (like bad wallpaper job).<br />The shape of the sock was also a little weird, tube sock like, even though there is a black heel color block. They were strangely long in the foot, which made that black heel not sit in any place that actually makes sense for a real foot. That black heel color difference is not pictured in the photo description, and was a very disappointing, and unwanted surprise.<br />The fabric material is strange. and honestly I'm skeptical about it really being made of 78% cotton.<br />I most definitely would not buy again, or really recommend."
1.0,"Super thin and slightly sheer (I got the gray). Arms were about 2-3 inches too short, same with the length of the shirt (at belt length). Super bummed and returning.  Do not expect to get what's in the pic but it still might be okay for you."
1.0,Unless you are a Victoria Secret model or very small do not order. If you are above a large in regular clothes don't buy.
1.0,Rusted within two weeks of wear
1.0,"Should have known better than to order cloths, fit In European size"
1.0,"I got these as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandson and he absolutely loved them.  Unfortunately,  after just 3 weeks they stopped taking a charge.  Thoroughly disappointing.  He LOVED the shoes so much."
1.0,The item was too small.
1.0,Package arrived yesterday. I was super excited so I wore it as an undershirt today. Came home and there’s already a hole. I had a shirt on over it so there’s no way I could have caught it in something. Super upsetting. I was honestly going to buy it in more colors until this happened. Will not be a repeat customer.
1.0,Arm space is very deep shows bar on side.  VERY short and cheap quality
1.0,Size not what I expected. I wear XL dress shoes and this is too tight.
1.0,They are very pretty and just to wear but I can’t wear a pair for a week without one of them breaking :/
1.0,"One arrives almost broken, another one broken after first week.<br />They are very very cheap quality and they I have a small allergic reaction."
1.0,After a rotator cuff surgery the snap buttons are not easy to use unless someone else is helping you get dressed which defeats the purpose of the shirt.
1.0,Didn't look like the dress that was pictured
1.0,It tried to strangle me!! This was WAYYY too small! I thought an XL would fit. Because that’s my size. Size up either one or two sizes. Awful!
1.0,Very cheap look and feel.  I guess you get what you pay for... but this is something that should come out of a gumball machine.
1.0,The color with 3 brown shades are only 1 color.
1.0,"Not flattering at all. Got the grey one for my daughter and it was huge!  Went off the sizing chart because of bust measurements and got the 2XL, but it was massive and covered her knees."
1.0,"not only did the product arrived tangled, but the color was wrong! The pictured necklace  showed gold beads, however I received pink beads. I’m very disappointed as I was planning to wear this  necklace today."
1.0,This was cute the roses actually a heart but it's like an ear ring it has a straight post and it's really short it is not made for a belly button at all so I had to send it back
1.0,"This shirt is NOT a slim fit shirt at all. The thick fleece shown in the pictures is non existent, this is a VERY thin shirt. (It's actually see through very clearly as shown in the middle picture.) The shirt is HUGE and is actually labeled even on the shipped item packaging as a regular fit down shirt. This is a cheap knockoff of a product, and for over 20 dollars, a nicer material shirt can be purchased at wal-mart for about 8-12 dollars.)"
1.0,Great deal but HORRIBLE quality. I wore a pair of earrings one day and they already broke. Don’t buy if you’re looking for quality.
1.0,"Pretty design but there is no extra lining and pull have to wear it with slip underneath<br /><br />UPDATE: shrinks like two sizes after one wash, cold and air dry everything. The dress is now a long shirt. I can't really wear this anymore and it's no longer flattering."
1.0,"The hat was crushed beyond all recognition on delivery. I tried to restore it but couldn't. The hat was packaged in an evelope and not a box. The hat was on the floppy side as the brim did not retain any type of stiffness. The belt on the hat arrived off the hat and was glued. If you are looking for a Straw Fedora, FURTALK makes some quality ones. Add 98 cents to the above and you will have a dollar. Ciao, Rocco"
1.0,Not waterproof or even water resistant as stated. I need to send back but did not use in the rain till last week and got soaked’
1.0,Material felt cheats on me
1.0,Broke in 1 day simply by sliding out of bed
1.0,COMPLETELY dissatisfied!!! They soaked up the water fine.  I used cold water with ice in it.  They did not stay cold for any measurable period of time.  I have had similar scarves in the past but this is NOWHERE near as good.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone!!! Only gave one star because it is the lowest rating!!
1.0,"Segunda vez que compro el vestido, la primera vez no llegó el envío y esta vez enviaron el modelo equivocado"
1.0,Bought two pals of these after about 3 or 4 eases 3 pair had to be thrown away all the seams came apart. I would not buy again.
1.0,Thin and cheap looking scratched right away
1.0,"Received costume for my daughter today. She picked it herself and was really excited. The ""wings"" were not attached on the right side, with the threads clearly pulled out and the seam separating. All the other costumes we ordered from other brands for our family came in great condition, but I am going to have to sew this one back together. Returning it is even more annoying than just sewing it back together myself. Buyer beware, it's cheap for a reason."
1.0,The product is comfy but not very durable. After 5th day using the waders I already have a leak on the edge of the steam.
1.0,"Didn’t get the corset, just the skirt which was not even the same one I purchased. Returned the same day got the package"
1.0,The center piece just snapped off 🙁.  Only had them 2 months wore them 4 times.
1.0,Men’s pants ripped after wearing them an hour. Pants material feels more like burlap and we weren’t able to wear them long. Women’s shirt decal is way off center. Do your self a favor and do not order these. They are definitely not worth it.
1.0,First off i got sent a 3x shirt.<br />Its a thin material shirt.<br />The picture is what i believe a vinyl sticker; Which has defects.
1.0,"Poor quality, miscentered"
1.0,Even a large is too tight & I have small calves!
1.0,"Dress is not a right fit also it was stinking horribly when I opened the package,"
1.0,Small and unable to wear.
1.0,These must be knock-offs. I've never had such a cheaply made pair of Smart wools. They don't feel like every other Smartwools I own and they slouched with first wear- not acceptable! They are basically unwearable.
1.0,Unfortunately the item ended M up being small. Too tight on the legs and unfortunately I can't return it because there was a deadline. I'm hoping the make will reach out to me to figure out how to get refunded for this item.
1.0,"This a very cheap necklace that is supposed to wrap around your ankle, but it's too big.  It's too trashy looking (even for your ankle) and because it's so large - it hangs below your ankle and gets caught in your shoes.  Don't waste your money if you plan on wearing it everyday.  It's ugly.  It's painful.  It's not as described.  Buy something else that's smaller, thinner, and prettier."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:fad43290c886eddfac67b92b76e91d81]] We bought two watches. Both are not working. The minute hands are loosing. I mean BOTH OF THEM are loosing. Since we pass the return period, so we cannot return it. Totally useless now."
1.0,I didn't like that the hat I ordered was suppose to have a Ugg label on it and it doesn't that's the reason why I picked that one
1.0,Way to big for like a bath robe just not cute
1.0,Dont fix on baby feet.
1.0,Just recieved an empty bag! No key chain
1.0,fall apart in 2 days
1.0,XL is supposed to fit 16-18... but really more like a 8.... really!!!  Hate it more than anything else in life....but too lazy to return... it will be a great 5 dollar dust rag.  no joke.  horrible.
1.0,Fits small and rides up.
1.0,This is the second I sent for this item.What i got was NOT on a silver chain it was on a fake leather cord.The charm wasn't even what was advertized.This SUCKS.CANT YOU PEOPLE SEND WHAT I ASKED FOR?.i Order very much from amazon and this is VERY DISAPPOINTING
1.0,"They fit according to the size chart, but they've already begun to fall apart and have only been worn 3 times, and only once in water. Very sad. But it is reflected in the price."
1.0,It’s about 3 sizes smaller than what I normally wear.  It’s worthless to me
1.0,I ordered the khaki color but it was more golden color the material was  Suede which was fine but it didn't look like the pic
1.0,Had tear in a couple weeks
1.0,I purchased the sister set with the deer pants. The top and bottom do not match. The top has red flowers and the pants have pink flowers. They do not look good together.
1.0,"Size up at least one size. My kiddos are petite and they fit tight. We had to wear them for pajama week the next day or I would have returned them. After the first wash, they couldn’t wear them anymore. The sleeves were so tight it would have cut off circulation."
1.0,They shrunk in the wash. After washing they are a good fit for my 10 year old daughter.
1.0,Very big size<br />Not suitable for kids
1.0,Beautiful but broke after 2/3 weeks ... total waste of money... wish I was able to get a refund.
1.0,"The wig seemed like it was not new.  The packaging is scratched up and no tags attached.  I suspect I got a returned item, after someone actually wore it.  Not cool."
1.0,The clock fell off about a week later. It cute and I loved it except that it is not sturdy enough to actually use as a keychain attachment.
1.0,Does not fit at all like the pic shows on the model. The quality of the material wasn’t good either. Big and boxy.
1.0,Stones are not real😭
1.0,African amythists are supposed to be dark not see through
1.0,"These masks are described as full cover dust protectors & they are far from it. They are made of a light, stretchy plastic material covered in holes. They literally serve zero purpose and are nothing like the images. They are equivalent to wearing mesh as a face covering. They’re cute, but I need to find material to add to the inside, to actually make them protective."
1.0,Poorly designed and made
1.0,Does not look like the picture. It actually is rather shorter than shown. It is warm but not cute like the picture. I wear a large but this large was too small.
1.0,These were very poor quality. They arrived and 4 out of the 6 pairs were broken. The pearls were not even attached to the earrings.  The other 2 pair I lifted out of the box and the pearls fell off.
1.0,These masks are terribly made  they smell they did not last after a few washings they had a terrible odor and it took 2 months to receive them
1.0,The sizes are WAY too small. The material is ok. Believe everything the other reviews say. The largest size could be comparable to a size 14 or 16 but that is being generous. I am an American size 18 to 20 and the largest size did not fit.<br />The sewing was not good at all. There are pleats where the pleats are unflattering. I've heard that it's difficult to return so I'm just going to re-gift.
1.0,I dislike the plastic feel on my face.
1.0,first i received my package and it was ripped then received the replacement but they break and come apart know wonder why there is 20 of them
1.0,More like see through leggings. Thin
1.0,Very lose and after one laundry the colors gone hahah
1.0,Runs super small and super short...missed my return window...so figuring out what to do with it...also doesn’t look like photo at all.
1.0,The shoes are not the same size.  They are not made to hold up longer than just trying them on.  Poor quality.  I took a picture of them but this won't let me add a photo.
1.0,"So disappointed!!.. I just wore it for the first time to my Caribbean vacation and on the first wear the stitching in one area came out and one bottom fell out. I don't think the stitching can even be fixed so I'd going to the garbage. I got this one because I had purchased the same one a long time ago and I lost it, but it seems the quality went down. Waste of money."
1.0,Print is way to small
1.0,The actual material of the purse is not good. I will not buy purses online again.
1.0,Horrible fabric and style
1.0,"I knew these would be a lighter brown, but they look straight orange. They fit well, are comfortable, but they’re also extremely noisy and squeak like SpongeBobs shoes. That’s the closest description I have. I feel like I could at least deal with them if they weren’t so orange! I am likely going to return them."
1.0,"Fits well, but absolutely not cotton. I would give a couple stars for the fit, but cotton is in the title. I need these for work tomorrow so I will not return them; I would otherwise. Do not buy if the cotton part is important to you."
1.0,"too short my daughter is 5'1"" and it just covers her bottom"
1.0,Very disappointed. My mask was broken and missing pieces. apparently shipped that way because the pieces were not in the package. A lot smaller than expected. I would give no star rating if I could.
1.0,It fits super oddly do not like it!
1.0,"These are WAY too small. I wear 32 waist, got  a large like my other joggers and holy tight batman! I gave them to my girlfriend to wear since she is tiny.<br />The color also was quite....shimmery considering I was expecting a more sweatpants kind of look. The color looked like puke.<br />Not much good to say.....the pockets could be useful....if they aren't smeared across your leg."
1.0,Way to tight around the chest area! The cut is just awful! I’m 23 weeks pregnant and really thought the dress would look good but I was wrong.
1.0,"I ordered a medium so I was assumed to be a kid ,…. So I had kid size letters on the back… VERY DISAPPOINTED!…. I didn’t even want to give it 1 star!!"
1.0,Too big to wear as intended lost gold tone after 2 days
1.0,This is coming from China. Quality is poor and size chart is inaccurate. I asked to return and was told it was cost prohibitive to send to China. I would avoid
1.0,"A big disappointment! I didn’t care for the fabric, it’s too stiff. And it doesn’t fit or feel that well around my waist. Next time, I’ll wait until a genuine handmade fanny pack-made by an experienced leather maker is available even if it is available outside Amazon.<br /><br />You get what you pay for-and I don’t mind paying a lot more for a pack that shall last for years."
1.0,"They’re awful. When you try to open them, they bend the other way. Horrible. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"It did what it was supposed to do, but looked cheap."
1.0,The entire Christmas scene of the skirt is upside down. Ridiculous.
1.0,Sent back sizes are way small
1.0,"It seems to eat batteries. I had to duct tape them in because they floated in the pack, and it only worked if the battery pack was held vertical. Don't bother with this product"
1.0,I bought an XL for myself and have it to my friends 10yr old daughter. It's tiny.
1.0,one broken in the first use.
1.0,Tiene mala calidad se abre solo
1.0,Mi compra fue en la talla mas grande para niña Xl<br />Y me llego en talla 7
1.0,I may as well have kept wearing my little lightweight jacket from Walmart. It kept me warmer than this so called parka!
1.0,"Awful, just awful.  I couldn't wait to take it off.  It isn't flattering and the fabric is not at all light and airy: it's heavy and hot. You would not be comfortable on the beach or in the heat while wearing this."
1.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the material. However, it is a costume, so keep that in mind. Way too large. I ordered a small. I'm a lady with 35"" chest, 27.5"" waist, 37"" hips. I could have ordered an extra, extra small based off of the small size."
1.0,"Its very obvious for the price but this is not worth it for a decent gift for anyone. Sometimes we are able to find steals on decent products, this is not one of them."
1.0,"Just opened my package, wallet is missing screws holding the plates on. I'm very disappointed"
1.0,"It's totally cute just as advertised, however after my second time wearing it it broke."
1.0,"Run very, very big. Fabric is nice and light. Shame. I really liked them. Will not be apart of my wardrobe."
1.0,"I bought a pair of these pants earlier this year and was very satisfied. This pair, however was poor/defector. Both the drawstring and the seam of the leg broke the first time I used them. I will return them."
1.0,Did not fit like a normal one piece  swimsuit.
1.0,"Do no buy! This shoe is poorly made and looked very cheap. The stitching was unraveling, the back of the shoe was coming undone and the fabric looked and felt cheap. It didn't even fit my foot properly. I returned the shoes the same day."
1.0,Bracelet becomes unhooked very easily. Easy to lose
1.0,"Had not even been 2 months and these are destroyed already, very bad quality for the price"
1.0,"Size runs extremely small, and shrunk after first wash to the point it was practically unwearable (maybe as a shirt)."
1.0,Pretty but arrived with a hole in the seam of the waist. Disappointing. Fits well true to size. Flattering overall. Just came damaged.
1.0,Yuk...awful...packaging poor...oh well..pay cheap..cheap is what you get...
1.0,Bad bad bad quality  Does not. Honor the marketing Scam intentions. Poor material nothing like the picture.<br />I
1.0,"I had to send this back, by the size chart I needed a medium, which is what I wear. However, a medium was way to small. Not sure if I will reorder an extra large or look elsewhere. The dress is very cute though sizes need to be listed more accurately."
1.0,"Cannot change Time or date,  very cheaply made ,"
1.0,"Extremely disappointed with this product:  quality, fit, etc.  Had to return and was out shipping both ways."
1.0,Very disappointing product. Silver ion pieces fell out after a couple of days. Would like a replacement sent and take my chances.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Not worth the price. Like a thick old navy flip flop
1.0,This item was already worn and had stain in the inside and smelly. Very disrespectful to sell a customer used product.
1.0,My daughter only tried this dress on.  The way the seams are done makes it scratchy and the fit is not good.  It has been back in the package since the first day and I'm hoping you will take it back.  Otherwise I will donate it.
1.0,"I used the size chart and went up one size from that. Two pair for the rest were so small, I couldn’t even pull them up. I’m so disappointed. I do recommend even trying them."
1.0,"Be careful when you launder this shirt! It shrunk two sizes (at least!) the first time I laundered this shirt. This has never happened with any other item of clothing. Very disappointed, as this was a Father's Day gift for my husband. It is now my son's."
1.0,The fit of the bottoms was too big and caused it to bunch up in the crotch area.
1.0,"Not a good quality, the bracelet broke the first time I put it on."
1.0,Not real silver the post will change colors after wearing them
1.0,"Meh. I ordered these in other colors (red, blk, blue), and found that the small was a bit large, but the fabric was nice and thick; giving support and coverage. So I decided to keep them, and actually had to machine wash them in hot water and dry them in the dryer, in order to shrink them down to a proper fit. I also purchased the Tiedye pink, and found the same issue, but the fabric is a really thin t-shirt/cotton fabric, and therefore, far too thin for support. The dress (small) would fit better on a wombman that wears a medium. The Tiedye Pink was a total waste of time and money. This maker should stop misleading with it's sizes, or offer up the dresses in an extra small."
1.0,Small square and doesn’t shine the jewelry at al.  Very disappointed.
1.0,The fact they run at least 2 sizes smaller the soles are terrible they were cheap and that's what I got! I am not finding a drop off and would cost me more to send them back so just fiindinfing someone to give them to!
1.0,"I returned this.  I know it was cheap, but it was really terrible"
1.0,Totally see-through and very long. I'm 5'2&#34;
1.0,"Fitting is good but very cheap fabric.Good for one time use only,got fade after one wash."
1.0,Got a hole in the thumb the first wrek
1.0,"Too big, not what I expected. I'll never wear these flimsy glasses."
1.0,"I normally where a size large, but since the reviews said that it runs small- I decided to order an XL. I have a really short torso, so normally it is hard to find shirts that aren’t to long. This shirt was the complete opposite. It was so short, it pretty much sat at my belly button and was super tight all around. I will be returning."
1.0,Poorly made ..the post bent when trying to put the back on the earring.  Waste of money
1.0,"This is the lowest mesh bracelet quality I’ve ever seen. It’s not a 304 grade stainless steel. The entire bracelet was not PVD coated, instead it’s colored with a cheap black color can be scratched by your finger nail. The item deserves less than one star. Overpriced for the quality. Not recommended."
1.0,The quality is so poor it's almost unusable.  I would only recommend if your trip is short and you only plan on using it once.  The internal frame can be bent with one hand.
1.0,I liked the watch but it broke four days later after wearing it.
1.0,My feet become sore whenever I wear the slippers.
1.0,"Pants have very wide, short legs. Material is soft, but incredibly thin. Returns are NOT free. Return postage is the cost of shipping product back to China, so it costs far more to ship it back than the product costs. Very disappointing purchase."
1.0,The rings changes colors a few days later.
1.0,Won't stay on at all. Disappointed  in th quality. I paid for a name that did not live up p expectations.
1.0,Earrings arrived broken in the package.
1.0,Very cheap quality- falling apart after opening and after first wear there is no further use possible as distorted.
1.0,They came all twisted and are very cheaply made.
1.0,Very poor quality. Came in dented and scratched up case. Seems to be made out of cheap plastic. Face of watch scratched and poor quality. Very disappointed with purchase.
1.0,Made in China not American size far to small
1.0,The dress wasn't complete. Was weird around arms and didn't seem to be completely sewn. Would have been a beautiful dress if it would have been completed or if i had time to hire someone to do so.
1.0,Had a hole
1.0,"Dates are in Chinese and english, the belt buckle turned it upside down."
1.0,Daycare requested pre-walker soft shoes for my 7 moth old since he is pulling up and cruising. I thought that the bottom was supposed to have support around the sides and the ankles but it didn't after 10 minutes of use his foot slipped out the sole and the bunny faces came off you gt what you pay for.
1.0,"This item is ridiculous. The fabric print on the back of the shirt is literally upside down, as shown. Unfortunately I didn't catch this when I ordered the second time. Shame selling this product."
1.0,"really looked cheap, looked more like a large dress than a swim suit"
1.0,"Nice color but the fabric is cheap, very transparent. not soft nor elegant, nothing like the picture, just a paper bag. This is going back"
1.0,I got the wrong one i would like a refund
1.0,The sole on the picture are BLACK. However when I opened the package the sole is WHITE. This is very misleading for a shopper
1.0,"I got rain coats cheaper at Walt Disney World. It was cheap plastic instead of nylon fabric, it would tend to get hot."
1.0,Don't waste your money on these
1.0,"The sizing was incredibly off.  The  ""flex"" basically was non-existent."
1.0,"I bought this in the Navy size small.  I have to say overall, this is a terribly made dress.  First the sizing is horrible.  I wear a US size 4 and I could not even get this to close in the front at all.  On top of that with it being a wrap dress, it should have only one hole or slit on one side in order to tie the dress and wrap it round.  It has a hole on both sides so no matter what you do, you are left with a huge open hole on one side.  Just very poorly made.  I would not recommend this dress at all."
1.0,"Wish I could get money worth but I do not recommend buying this, to big and the chain was broken. For 14 dollars you could get a nice necklace. Got this in my stocking and was very disappointed and would call this the worst gift I have gotten so far. Very disappointed and didn’t like it, the charm is the only thing that I kept."
1.0,"Cute shoe's would have loved them but I ware a size 6 to 6.5, ordered 6.5 and they are like a child's size.  No way are they women's sizes.  They are about 1 1/2&#34; to small."
1.0,Got rusty real fast. Had to throw them away after 6 weeks. They were real cheap and were very comfortable to wear. To bad they rusted so fast.
1.0,Wore off.
1.0,I read reviews and went with a smaller size ( i am 5.4 and weigh 141 with curvy figure). Size small was good size. I normally would use a medium. The quality of the fabric is very very mediocre. I thought due to the stellar reviews this was going to be a great quality night dress but if i went shopping to a discount store this dress would probably be on sale for $5.<br />i rarely write reviews but the great reviews not sure were based on what. Im starting to wonder about these reviews
1.0,"I’ve owned 3 authentic pairs of these glasses before & there is no chance these were authentic. When I opened the box, I thought there was a crack in the middle of the glasses, but it was actually the screws holding the top Tom Ford plate in place. You would never visually see the screws in any authentic pair of Tom Ford products. The good news is they refunded my money, so if you take a chance and it doesn’t work out, the return process was easy."
1.0,maybe I just have fat toes - but it cut off the circulation in my baby toe.  Can't wear them.
1.0,"Everything about this mask is no good. Fitting is not comfortable, it looks hideous when you wear it, and the voice activation does not respond correctly.<br />Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,Not a fan of dress or material.
1.0,Absolutely awful product. Glasses look and feel super cheap- worse than a tacky Halloween costume. Do not buy these!!!
1.0,The package did not have the shirt
1.0,I ordered size 0-6 months and recieved a 2t smh
1.0,This fell apart before I even got to wear it once.
1.0,Cheep made very disappointed
1.0,the scarf was damaged sent replacement and hat is grey not light blue the scarf is very light
1.0,Thin...see through from head to toe!
1.0,"After only 3 uses, two of the straps have already come apart from the bag. Very disappointed"
1.0,I ordered this beautiful rose gold bracelet and got some cheap pink hook instead. Very upsetting.
1.0,Wouldn't wrap fully around my hips...
1.0,The item description is wrong . The colors are not as described. I ordered the coral / light pink and it came in bright orange so I had to return it.
1.0,"It rolls up, not happy with it."
1.0,"I love the print, but they are so horrible and they do not stay on my head at night. I was wanting some extra satin bonnets so I wouldn’t have to wear the same one all the time since they stink after a while."
1.0,The band is very small. Barely fits my wrist. Usually smalls fit but not these.
1.0,I have only had this for a little over a month and it is coming apart at handle. Very disappointed! I feel like it was a defect. Can I return this after it’s been used?  My return window closed last week.
1.0,Only wore once because black color ran into white ruining it
1.0,Way too small bad product
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Material sucks
1.0,Hate it cuz color is coming off
1.0,"Would've been 5-star but the ankle adjustment clamp is absolutely terrible in every way. It doesn't sit flat against the ankle, it doesn't stay clasped while being worn, and it digs into the skin making them unbearable after just a few minutes of use. Will NOT be buying again."
1.0,These run small.  Not for adults.
1.0,"[[ASIN:B019W2F3MG Phoenix Womens Oversized Batwing Knitted Pullover Loose Sweater Tee Tops, Khaki One Size]]<br /><br />Mrs. Banks, here - I share my husband' Amazon Prime.  I wanted to love this, and hate may be too strong a word, but what arrived is NOTHING like what is pictured - as others commented, it is not loose at the bottom and not as long as pictured.  A huge disappointment."
1.0,"The dress itself is like something i would expect to pick up from the dollar store on the way to the beach to throw over my swim suit... not very flattering. the skirt doesnt bell like the pictures show. it tappers back in a bit, making my size 18+ butt and hips look so much larger than necessary. Doesnt have any loops for the belt. And the straps are not the same as the picture! i ordered specifically because the picture made it look like the dress had roughly 1 inch thick straps, thick enough to still wear a bra with the dress. these are much smaller, and a cheap sew line through it. just looks like a cheap dress..."
1.0,"I haven’t purchased this hat, but they’ve stolen photos from the Briar Baby website. If you want a hat like the ones the children in the photos are wearing, check them out. They have excellent quality hats."
1.0,"The clasp broke within a few days of receipt, and when we contacted the vendor, they said they could reimburse us a portion of the cost."
1.0,The rhinestones are very sharp and have snagged my shirts numerous times.
1.0,Waaaaay too small with little stretch.
1.0,hate it
1.0,"It cuts super small, so you may need to size up"
1.0,It broke in half while a tried to adjusted a few days  after I received it.
1.0,broke in 2 days..cheaply made..
1.0,"I bought these for the anti-glare feature, but they aren't anti-glare at all. I compared them to my regular glasses that actually have an anti-glare coating, and to my contacts (no special coating, but I can see), and these seem to actually INCREASE glare compared to my contacts. They were otherwise okay, fit comfortably, no manufacturing defects that I could tell, but to say they are anti-glare or that they have a coating that decreases glare, is simply not true. Had to return."
1.0,Cute sweater but fits nothing like the picture
1.0,Jacket is way too small. Working with PASOK on a remedy. .
1.0,Did not like the glasses
1.0,"The quality of the product is very bad, and the colors indicated by the photos are not the same as the ones I received, one arrived with the damaged bracelet"
1.0,"Got this as a gift and highly liked it for traveling international, as I haven’t had it a month and the metal is starting to seperate!"
1.0,These are worse than costumes quality. Construction of garment was terrible. Zero stars if I could. Return was not easy...
1.0,These don't fit larger heels even though it says for small and large sizes. If you have satin dress shoes they have the potential of ripping them. Also the return policy is ridiculous (not with Amazon but the complany) so I'm stuck with these now. Hopefully there are some guests at our wedding wearing stilletoes (because those may be the only narrow heels these will fit) so these don't feel like a complete waste.
1.0,It’s misleading.<br />The picture looks like a set. The description says outfits.<br />But it’s just a jacket. Material also is cheap. If I knew I’m paying $25 for just a jacket I wouldn’t have bought it.
1.0,"Garbage - the clasp was glued on upside down and when I tried to remove it to fix the bracelet the leather broke.  What a waste of $13.  Too late for me to return it.  Bummer.  The photo shows the clasp in the correct position, my unit had the clasp upside down."
1.0,item was a little to big for shoe size ordered additionally one of the shoes after 1 month of use doesnt even charge or light up anymore! waste of money!
1.0,Colud not figure out how to use it. No directions included.
1.0,You’ve got to be kidding me.  Seriously.  Waited for this piece of crap to arrive.  What a joke.  Will be returning.
1.0,Absolute garbage. Total waste of money.
1.0,The Jacket is warm but the hand pocket zippers Both  broke the first time wearing the jacket.
1.0,Horrible hologram on dress
1.0,Eagle hangs wrong. Not centered.
1.0,"I was in love with the blouse, 5 stars !  Then I wore it out and received so many compliments, how could it get any better, it was cute and inexpensive. The question I should have asked was, how could it get much worse.<br /><br />Upon opening the package I noticed the shirt had a few loose strands, didn't pay too much attention to, but then I wore it out and heard a pop and the shirt literally came down. Luckily, there are these cute little arm cuffs that kept the shirt from falling to my waist.  Made it home and attempted to gingerly take it off in hopes I could salvage this adorable little blouse, but then the arm cuff popped off.  Needless to say, I gave up.  5 stars for potential and 0 stars for almost exposing me to the public.  So dissapointed."
1.0,The top is small and the pants split the seam when they were washed.
1.0,"***Update: Returned this item and received a replacement and it has the same problem - the graphics on the strap are upside down.  When wearing the strap, the skulls are upside down.  Definitely, a manufacturer defect. I'm keeping this<br />one but will be letting wife swap the ends so that the images will be correct.***<br /><br />Just can't seem to win with this particular design. Second time I ordered this strap. 1st time they sent the wrong design. This time the strap is sewn backwards/upside down. See picture. Other than that it's a great strap. Nice and long too."
1.0,Sent back item too small
1.0,It was slow getting to me. Just cheap material- like it can from China
1.0,"I purchased a small white pullover with a rainbow patch. Unfortunately, the pullover came without the patch, why is why I purchased the item. I haven't had the time to return it, so I suppose I will buy a patch of my own elsewhere. The actual material itself is thin and somewhat uncomfortable. Not worth it for the product you are receiving. It does fit nicely though."
1.0,Item received broken
1.0,"These are so very small you need a magnifying glass to see them.  I honestly couldn't tell if they were the flower earrings i ordered. I bought them for my grand daughters 2 & 3, but I think they are way to tiny for them. Maybe OK for a new born.  I'll leave it up to my daughter to decide if I should return them.  They look like they would go straight through the hole in their ears."
1.0,"The flower broke off the earring the day after I put it in my ear. The sharp edges that were left after it the flower broke off (I had to leave it in my ear because it was our first day of vacation and couldn't take the piercing completely out) caused my piercing to get infected and I had to go back to a piercer to get a new earring and fix the drainage. $100 later, I was back to where I started when I first got it pierced!"
1.0,"The picture shown and what was sent to me are completely different dresses. This dress is awful!!! The material is extremely cheap. The color is more like a vomit purple, not a deep brown as shown. It’s not even a question of colors not looking the same on all screens...this is clearly just a different dress than the photos they are using. It’s gross & I’m so disappointed because I’ve been stalking this dress for a really long time! I finally decided to purchase it, and they sent me literal garbage."
1.0,I ordered these and opened up the box expecting earrings and instead received a pair of leggings that I did not order. Very disappointed because I was so excited to get these after reading the reviews.
1.0,Does not fit! Bought an XL and did not realize Asian sizes. Im a 46 chest and XL does not fit. XL is like a L.
1.0,is xx large but still to small waight my self 200 pound 5.7 tall
1.0,Tights fit ok but the tights are super see through.
1.0,Problem with size
1.0,Please save yourself the trouble!!!
1.0,The puzzle piece fell off the second day
1.0,It was a large size I order but they were too small and not good quality
1.0,Nothing like it looked it was stiff and velvety feeling like an old ladies robe would not buy from them again. Returned it already
1.0,"They look really nice .i have for a couples days..but they came with a defective on the left side, little blurry..so I have to put it in the garbage, can't see on the left side..I wish they give me my money back or send another pair in a good condition.."
1.0,"The reviews on this product were misleading- they were a good reason that I bought this. It was said that, if the tiers don't fall where you want them to, then you can hike it up. That's true, however, it makes the petticoat significantly shorter, too much so! I am 5'1 and this was still too short. The first tier begins way too low and begins abruptly, without a transition...so I looked like an upside down tree. It was not flattering at all. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless that's the look you're going for."
1.0,"First off this product forget to add the fact that it is not a skirt but a skort. Second of all the cute pattern displayed on the screen doesn't even stay for that long. When I received my skirt, it smelled off so I washed it, but to my surprise they just glued a pattern on the skirt and sprinkled black shavings of something on the skirt which came off. And right before I had the chance to wear it out no less. I went back to the packaging and it said something on the tag along the lines of do not apply water. But seeing as they sold this to another country this really should have been translated. I wasted time ad money waiting for this to arrive only for this to just be such a disappointing thing that didn't even allow me one outing. And thinking about it now if I had washed the skirt with my other clothes that would have been hundreds of dollars down the drain because it would have ruined my other clothing. This product is a waste of time and you really shouldn't spend your money on it. Find another product that is cheaper and made with better quality."
1.0,I order a size up and the sleeves were still too short..
1.0,Every single set I ordered (8) came with the pearls rolling around the box. Nothing some super glue won't fix. Just another stress to add to your big day.
1.0,not corect size
1.0,"The top smelled terrible!  Ive washed it twice and it still stinks!  The top runs large and boxy, definitely not a flattering cut.  Would not recommend!"
1.0,"Cute ad, great concept but a total scam and no way to reach seller. States it’s a matching set of outfits for Little Sister and another outfit for Big Sister, but even if u purchase both outfits, no guarantee that you will receive both sets!"
1.0,"This bracelet should’ve been the perfect gift for my friend, but when I received it, I was shocked at how different it looks in person. The bracelet material was barely thicker than a strand of regular thread and, while I didn’t expect super high quality for the beads themselves, when put together with the string, it was just all so poorly made and sooo tiny that I wasn’t sure it’d last more than a day on my friend’s wrist. So the only positive thing I can add is that the bracelet did arrive on time and the return process was easy. Other than that, I was glad to have been able to get my money back."
1.0,Cheap material. I wore it for exactly 2 days and on the second day both sleeves began to get &#34;fuzzies&#34; on them. One of the fuzzy strands snagged and a small hole formed that just split open to become a large hole. Completely useless now. And as I said this happened after less than two days. I bought a pair of Nike sleeves for $30 and I'm positive that they will last for several months of continuous wear.
1.0,We’re torn when received
1.0,Didn't fit my band. It doesn't snap into place. I'm really disappointed. I'm really glad for returns
1.0,"I am 5'2&#34; 132 pounds with 38&#34; DD bra size.  I ordered a medium.  It is huge on me.<br />The quality is poor.  I had to sew the buttons on securely because they were hanging by threads.<br />Also, you have to hang it to dry.<br />Way too expensive for the quality.<br />Update:  I hand washed it and hung it to dry on the shower rod.  When it had dried I noticed that I could see through the fabric!"
1.0,Strap would not stay on my sunglasses<br />So I would say this was useless to buy
1.0,"Immediately starting slipping! I’m not sure if the other reviews are fake or not, but my experience was completely different. I made sure my skin was completely clean and dry.  I’m a small C-cup and they didn’t even last 10 mins!"
1.0,Item came broken.<br />Update: it's been over 4 months since I left this review and nobody even bothered contacting me.
1.0,cheap garbage
1.0,I ordered before the reviews posted. The description read a dozen.  I paid $8 for 2 bandanas! I am NOT pleased.  What i thought was a great deal for party favors has turned into $4 bandanas that i could have gotten at Walmart for $1. Funny the description has been changed now too.
1.0,I wore it once and washed it and it tore a large hole in the material.I had to throw it away
1.0,Item looks nice but does ot work.  Replaced battery but still does not work.  Seller would accept return but not cost beneficial.  Cost too much to send back.
1.0,The dress is messed up in the back. I tried to return and was being charged 3.15 for shipping. I don't feel I should pay anything to return a dress that is defective. My choices are to keep the dress and receive 70% return or pay shipping to return it. The return should be free.
1.0,Terrible quality. Tried it on for pictures and there were HOLES in the seem of the waist line. Complete waste of money.
1.0,Zero stars. Hat came in crushed and faded. The strap wasn't even put on all the way. Extremely disappointing and returned the hat.
1.0,I bought outfit for my granddaughter the top looks like it can be worn as a dress and the pants are not girlish at all and the they have elastic at the ankles.
1.0,"VERY POOR quality lenses.<br />The power of these lenses are not as declared, it was even irregular power (hard focusing, like if right in the middle of the lenses it's power wasn't exactly what it is supposed to be) and you see the images in a yellow like color.<br />Unless this is your only option, make yourself a favor and don't waste you money is this eyeglasses."
1.0,"Uncomfortable 😣 very bad, shearing 😢"
1.0,While it is pretty in appearance it lacks quality. My daughter put it on and the clasp broke the first time she wore it. I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Loose fitting doesn't compress anything and I got a small.
1.0,"These are NOT a product that you want to choose to wear for cycling because they are a thin strip of foam without any gel or comfort at all.  It seriously just a pair of panties with some foam in the bottom area.  It doesn’t help your riding at all.  They do run small, but most everything does."
1.0,The worst item I have ever ordered! It's soooooo short in the length that it's like a sports bra! My 11 year old can't even wear it.
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for. I would have paid extra for air quality product. Maybe you need to use more glue?<br />Butterflies fell off.
1.0,"Really not happy with it, not comfortable to wear, not easy to put in & will have to cut it to remove it."
1.0,Both the earings and necklace are SO heavy I can't ware them. Especially the earings. They would ruin your ear lobes. The necklace is so large it looks funny also.
1.0,"Too small, more of like a change wallet. I can't even fit a dollar in it. Its good for a child's first wallet, but if youre looking for a real wallet, dont get it"
1.0,Received cheap clear gloves like you would use for food service.
1.0,"Shorts were way too small and when I requested a refund, it was returned to sender weeks later bc there was no such address. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
1.0,"I love the idea of the light but the one I got would not work for very long at a time maybe 2 seconds , I was so disappointed."
1.0,Beautiful soft fabric<br />However fit my body style frumpy<br />Speedy delivery
1.0,worst face mask ever<br />stiff and doesnt work
1.0,"VERY stiff leather takes FOREVER to break in and very uncomfortable boots all together.  No lining on inside of boot just the raw other side of the leather so it pulls your socks off as you take the boots off.  No cushion to sole of boot.  Really stiff rubber.  Cheap, poorly installed shoelace eyelets that rip up your laces.  Dye bleeds onto and stains your socks.  Boot sizes aren't accurate I had to go through three pairs to get the right size, which by the way terrible customer service the lady who sells these is a complete jerk.  Way over priced for what you get and when you most likely get the wrong size you have to pay to ship them back and then pay to have another pair shipped out.  DON'T BUY!"
1.0,KN95 Mask Product is thin compared to US counterpart;clearly stated made in China even though distributed by US company.  Beware!!  Not as advertised!!
1.0,"The dress is beautiful but it didn't fit me,am so sad because i was unable to wear it for the dinner i have."
1.0,"You can't see it when you first get it, but the band has ""AMEN †"" all over the band once it warms up. I'm Christian, but I believe in freedom of religion, and I do NOT appreciate this hidden message snuck into a product with NOTHING in the description about it. As such, this ring will be returned on principle, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,Got these for my adult son for Christmas. The heel was worn through in about 10 days. Bummer!
1.0,This is not a baby blue jersey. The color is awful. It took 8 weeks to receive. DO NOT PURCHASE!
1.0,Rated as a ZERO. SUCKS
1.0,Very disappointed. Does not reflect the image shown. Looks cheap. Colors were off.
1.0,Horrible. I'm 5'7 and 139lbs and it was recommended medium would fit me. These are way off and I feel like a got a kids size xsmall. I couldn't get them past my not so big thighs which is a first for me. Definitely going back. Lol unreal.7
1.0,"I was disappointed. The seams on the front pouch are absolutely sloppy, huge noticeable holes. No quality control at all, just cheap junk from china that ends up in the dump a month later. Save yourself the trouble and go to a store. Paying near $30 for a light hoodie… better off going to Old Navy"
1.0,Nunca los recibí
1.0,shorts fell apart today couple of days after return date<br />North 15 Men's Long Mesh Shorts with...
1.0,Very cheap looking. I do not recommend.
1.0,"I ordered two other dresses from this same company and item positing in other colors/patterns and I LOVE them. This one is a completely different fabric that is HEAVY and doesn't breath at all, the cut is different, the wrap ties lengths don't make sense and are completely uneven when tied, there's a button on the chest that doesn't stay buttoned and even if it did it causes the fabric to pull and create a gap.<br /><br />I'm so confused. The other two dresses I order are great, but this one was awful."
1.0,very cheap. Returned
1.0,The main thing for me was the color was wayyyyy off. The beautiful blood red in the picture was more of an overwashed dead paint-look red. And the orange accents in the sleeves where a horribly tacky neon orange.
1.0,I had to return it. Pants was extremely large. Material was cheap.
1.0,I returned these because they were so small.
1.0,This was so cute but it turned/tarnished and it had to be thrown out.
1.0,These are terribly cheap glasses that hair-lined fractured right on the nose rest. Not long after they come rely broke in half. We were on vacation in Mexico so I didn't bother to bring back broken glasses to return. Junk. Dont waste your money.
1.0,I love dress. Would like to exchange fore larger size even though im outside return window. Is that possible for even exchange?
1.0,"I was influenced by the positive reviews these socks received which inspired me to buy them.  What a mistake!  They feel cheap!  Seems like I could have bought them from the $99 cent store.  These socks are awful & I cannot recommend them.  I see no value or any great properties these socks are touted to possess.  They should have been advertised as a dress sock more than anything else.  They are thin & don't feel like a good quality Merino wool sock. I expected a bit thicker sock.  If you want a thin sock  buy them,  otherwise if you want a more substantial Merino Wool sock, check out QVC.  Will give them away to a needy person."
1.0,"The top one is the replacement strap. It is a larger diameter than the original which is the bottom.  Also, the buckle is smaller than original and the word ""SWATCH"" is etched into the metal, not cast into it.<br />A nice strap but it does not work."
1.0,I gave these as an xmas gift and recieved a picture message wondering where I got them from because they have freaking swastikas in the pattern! So not cool.
1.0,Okay so I was really excited about getting this dress and when I received it I was severely let down considering this dress was not wearable at all because they used the same pattern cut for the front top if the dress as they did for the back top of the dress and there was no way it was going to cover my breasts let alone anyone's breasts who wore this dress. I wish it were different and I hope that they all aren't like this because I would like to try ND reorder another in the future
1.0,At a first glance the earrings look very nice but my daughter has been wearing them for 2 Weeks and they are all black and look horrible ..the quality is not good .. I’m skeptical to believe they are even sterling silver like discribed
1.0,"I was very excited when I received this product in the mail. When I opened it and went to unscrew the ball from the belly ring, it completely fell apart. The star part fell right off of the ring piece, and when I looked closer, it was apparent that it had been SUPER GLUED......And was not made properly at all. I would not recommend anyone buy this specific product.... I was very unsatisfied."
1.0,Buy up a size. Material is very thin. Feels like cheap pajama material. Would not recommend.
1.0,The stitching came undone on the first day. Very disappointed because I really liked the dress but was unable to use it.
1.0,The chain is light but it seems extremely weak and easy to break. The clasp was not fully closed so I could not even wear it once.
1.0,"Lock broke off the first day , it's extremely cheap and very small almost nothing fits , bad mistake ."
1.0,Too small. Even the large would fit a small 10 year old.
1.0,"Worst piece of cr*p ever. Covered in glue, faded cheap fabric. Absolute trash and returns are not eligible due to 'gas or flammable' item. How did this get shipped!"
1.0,"Wish I could give zero stars. Material is cheap and totally see through. The elastic of the waist band gets twisted because it floats around inside the fabric. The heart doesn't match up and is not shaped like in the photo. You get what you pay for I guess, cause these leggings are pure garbage."
1.0,Very poor quality. seams ripped out the first time I wore them. Very disappointed because they were so pretty and the soft texture was nice.
1.0,If I could rate this -100 stars I would. Don't waste your money
1.0,"Sorry, I can't recommend these shoes, I didn't buy them the person that did is no longer with us period."
1.0,to repeat what another reviewer wrote - this is not waterproof.  I got caught in a downpour while wearing it and found out the hard way.  I suggest  you keep looking for a real  raincoat
1.0,"The description says that it is cotton, but it really is not, it is a fabric similar to plastic canvas, when having it in contact with the skin it creates an allergic reaction and you will have a lot of itching on your face.<br /><br />If it was not such a delicate product, I would return it without thinking twice.<br /><br />If you don't want to waste your money, stay away from this product."
1.0,Material is reallllllly cheap! Not going to wear it.
1.0,"I've been wearing them everyday, sixteen bucks! so far so good.<br />After a few months both soles cracked, wow, I hate to throw money away."
1.0,The fabric is cheaply made I would not buy it again
1.0,"This is NOT a workout short.  I was so excited when I ordered, but never sent something back so fast.  They look good on a standing model, but the fabric is so cheap and flimsy there is no way these would hold together for more than a single workout.  I'm 158 lbs with a 32 inch waist, ordered a medium, they were so thin and baggy, the material would have stretched out so easily that 2 of me would have fit into these."
1.0,"It's a shame...the gemstones are gorgeous, but they ""cheeped out"" with the metal selection. Don't waste your time."
1.0,Looks good but but very cheap
1.0,"The capes I received are the same all the way around. The photo show the cape extending on to the forearm but it doesn't even reach the elbow and it's even all the way around. Also, the buttons on the caps were missing. bad product."
1.0,"I ordered the wrong band.  However, it was pretty."
1.0,This watch started making a very loud sound as the microphone would not shut off and watch would not shut down. It started getting extremely hot and disassembled it to get the microphone button disconnected. We had just started using the watch for about a month when this happened.
1.0,"Said it was for a 12 month baby, baby was 5 months old at the time. It was too small"
1.0,The large was really a small and did not fit at all like the photo. Another one that took forever to come from China
1.0,"wanted a black collar-buttoned black shirt.  laudered it....alot of color came out.....collar buttons that were not fastened thru the holes, were loose and when I tried to button them, there were long threads exposed and the buttons simply fell off.  No inspection at your facility?  No quality control?  Badly done.  Have to find the needle and thread now, to repair a brand new shirt."
1.0,It would fit if the crotch was where it is on the model in the picture... if I pull the crotch up to where it's supposed to be the lace is WAY too tight on my thighs... and it would be way too high on the waist... what the hell kind of person is this made to fit? What a waste of $15...
1.0,I loved it when it first arrived. However only 4 months in and I had to replace it as the inner liner came apart  at the seams. the stitching on the handles also comes apart. I loved the look but do not recommend purchasing.
1.0,Good looking shirt. Size was incredibly small.
1.0,I DID NOT LIKE THE DRESS AT ALL.... VERY CHEAP QUALITY!
1.0,"Shirt is made of some kind of polyester. Not sure how it will hold up after several washes. The right sleeve is sewn incorrectly- the stripes don’t match up at the seams, and there is a pouch of extra fabric. Unfortunately I can’t return it since I lost the packaging. Would not recommend."
1.0,"Poor quality and out of first 5 attempted to use (carefully and with jewelry pliers), 4 have immediately snapped. These are made of cheap plastic and waste of money."
1.0,Not what I expected. Thought they would be much different
1.0,DID NOT WORK
1.0,Too big and too thin of a material.
1.0,"This top is not as advertised. Actually, size xxl-is a crop top-a short crop top. Buyer beware if you choose to purchase-shirt barely reaches waist-not a tunic as shown. Very disappointed with product photo & description-zero stars."
1.0,"Poorly made. All surfaces very rough. They snag your clothing, catch your hair. Bottom ""pendant"" is poorly attached, bent and crooked. I will never buy from this vendor again. Cheap is cheap! I should have know better."
1.0,Poorly made and not even worth the price..
1.0,Cheap but pretty enough I guess. Poor quality.
1.0,I really wanted to like this dress after reading all of the reviews. I had ordered it in white. Unfortunately when it came in and I tried it on I was terribly disappointed!<br />It was SHEER and I mean you could see everything through it. I was even wearing a pair of white Nike shorts underneath it and you could even see the symbol on the shorts through it. I wish this dress would’ve worked because it was beautiful. It just felt very cheap
1.0,This product was ordered as a 2x . It’s not even close ! I don’t know if it would even qualify as an XL ? Total waste of money for me . I may be able to find some kid to give it too !
1.0,I would think the lens would work for more than 4 months now and unusable due to the light cray around all of the edges. Cheap plastic lens damaged by the Sun or defective. The frame is fine. Photo attached.
1.0,Piece of flat metal with printed paper glued on one side. Cheap cheap cheap.
1.0,"Dealer was great shipping was great, but the product is cheap, wrist ring breaks easy, doesn't stretch in or in the hand, and very poorly made, pay for what ya get I guess, owell for trying something new!"
1.0,"I was excited to get this handsome pin and I wore it with pride every day, until it broke. After only 1 month, the hoop snapped off."
1.0,They were small and easily broken. They were cute.
1.0,There all right just got two of the same side on one of the ear. 😯
1.0,the inside surface scratched the phones pre-installed screen protector.
1.0,pain in the ass to use
1.0,It was cheap and the color is not like the pic.
1.0,Terrible quality.
1.0,"I I thought my black ones had a defect but these also have just one lense polarized. Seems like quality check is not good because I now have two sunglasses from the same company with just one lense polarized.  That’s my only complaint, they are cute."
1.0,"I am into funky dress socks, and I wear all different kinds. These were too short and had misspelled words on them."
1.0,"Ordered XL fit like a medium, had to return."
1.0,I love these at first BUT then i changed out one bar for the rose gold...now ALL 3 with the little sparkle circles are stripped and i can’t use them now. The ball just falls off. So if you want to have them fall off you have a great product.
1.0,"This shirt feels like the material camping tents are made of, it’s super cheaply made and gets extremely hot underneath, not breathable at all. The design is cool but that’s about it. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"Way too small. I am super disappointed because this was on my Amazon wish list and my husband bought it for me as a gift, but the size chart is wrong and the size it said I needed was way way too small. It's not very soft or silky either and wasn't quite what I was expecting. Cheap and not great quality. I will be returning it."
1.0,If I could give this zero stars I would. These ARE NOT sterling silver. They aren’t stamped when you get them and they turn your skin green within days. I had my chain on and slept with it on and in the morning it was horrible. This seller is using fraudulent selling tactics to take your money... STAY AWAY!
1.0,"It is made of a plastic kinda of material. It felt like if I kept walking my pants would catch fire. And I returned it, but never got my money back, although it showed for the longest time that they received the item back."
1.0,"Unfortunately I had to give it a star. It broke before I left the house. It wouldn’t stay clasped and before I knew it, it fell apart. DON’T BUY"
1.0,I am so disappointed in this bag.  I was looking for a brown and creme bag that was spacious and felt like it was quality. What I got was a brown and cream bag that is so ill-created that the brown on the straps has STAINED the creme color of the purse.  The &#34;pleater&#34; is super thin and not sewn well.  It is a poor cut and I would not repurchase this bag.
1.0,In the first laundry (delicate cycle)...dont waste your money
1.0,"Have tried every since I got this in to make it presentable. It doesn’t look pretty because it’s so twisted up when I received it. Why advertise it looking like this, when it’s not when you get it!"
1.0,The material of this dress was hard and stiff.  It was shorter than expected not good quality.  I sent it back
1.0,Does not stay on your ear. Does not really fit like the picture. I do not recommend this
1.0,"This mask was very cheap made, didn’t fit anyone in the house good"
1.0,Thin material. Runs small.
1.0,"This tee shirt size says large, but fits like a small? Do not purchase. This was a waste of time. Returning as soon as possible."
1.0,"Horrible and very poorly made. I wouldn't waste my money, again!!"
1.0,"Back fell apart on 2nd day, along with strap."
1.0,This product was not size advertised.  Too wide.  Need to return and get correct size
1.0,Really gorgeous outfit if it fits. You must be pretty busty to wear it.
1.0,The fabric is stiff and looks like one of those walmat tees that you know will be peeling and have holes after just one wash even if you don't throw it in the dryer. Will be returning.
1.0,Poorly made. Square neck is not square. Absolutely hated not even workable to wear.
1.0,This ring is horrible it changed my finger Color and I will never buy a kind like this again
1.0,"after reading the product info, I made sure this would fit with the extra 2 inches. It actually fell short almost a complete inch. My family member was very upset that her gift didn't fit & now wears it around her wrist. FYI she's not a large person, nor does she have large ankles. very disappointing."
1.0,too stiff to wear. also has a bubble along the length of the item.
1.0,"Missing a button.  The spot where the button should be is marked,  but no button was sewn on.<br /><br />I placed an order a second time and the buttons were off."
1.0,The magnet closure doesn't work well.
1.0,I neve received this item and got no feedback when I reached out.
1.0,"These were great for a few uses, but they fell apart after a month. I ordered these on June 8th, wore/washed then a handful of times, and lo and behold on July 18 holes in the crotch started showing and the drawstring cloth was fraying. I don't even use the drawstring....<br />I just pulled these out of the washer a few minutes ago, and there's a huge 4"" rip in the crotch that wasn't there before I put it in. They're so delicate, which is really disappointing considering they're not exactly cheap. You'd do better shopping at Walmart for something that might at least last a while...<br />Also, I ordered the same size and three different colors, black and gray fit well but camo was noticeably larger in the waist while marked the same size. Had to send the camo back. In hindsight, should have sent everything back."
1.0,"Got it mid July 2017, came apart March 2018. Missing a screw. If not for that I would have given it 5 stars for functionality."
1.0,So the sequins are beautifully done and the tree pattern is beautiful.  Here is the problem the black fabric is really inexpensive looking.  very shiny and wrinkles immediately.  What a shame since it could be great.
1.0,Cute but cheaply made ruffle was already detached
1.0,"The product came in a timely manner, but the necklace was broken and I had beads all over the place, very disappointed . It was going in the Christmas box for my grandaughter."
1.0,Not the same product as pictured<br />Disappointed in this purchase
1.0,I have ordered two other dresses from this company. I loved them. They fit great and the material was lovely. This dress (the autumn looking leaf print) is just a big no. The material is paper thin. It feels like a cheap table cloth. The cut is way off and is only exaggerated by the terrible material. I will say I ordered the red with flowers dress and the black with flowers and they were nice material that did stretch a little thin around the bust (I am 40DDD so I expected this)
1.0,"Very thin material, I returned the item."
1.0,These were the worse gloves. I bought them as a part of my Halloween costume and within an hour they were coming apart by the thumbs. I would never buy these again.
1.0,Very poorly made. There is a huge hole on one of the seams when I opened the package.
1.0,"These arrived unbalanced and thus, do not sit well/straight on my face. Overall, quality seems poor and I am disappointed in them."
1.0,Flimsy and my eyes got sunburned while wearing them. But they are very pretty.
1.0,You can see right through the dress. Very cheap and not flattering. I am returning.
1.0,Piece of crap . Broke as soon as I put it on
1.0,Worst buy ever! Fell apart almost immediately! Don’t buy!
1.0,THE 10/12 FITS MORE LIKE A 7/8 bUYER BEWARE
1.0,I received the wrong product
1.0,"When I received it, it had a tear at the back when the zipper connected to the fabric showing that there was hole in it so I didn't put it on at all. Fast shipping, but damaged goods."
1.0,"Muy mala calidad, no sirve para nada no lo recomiendo a nadie ni regalado"
1.0,The design doesn't allow for inserting one of the extra beads so this purchase was disappointing.
1.0,"I think it is faux leather bag, looks very cheap."
1.0,The waist was to wide
1.0,Got to Rome and one tag was gone as it was ripped off the loop. Might be an opportunity for quality improvement.
1.0,"I generally have liked my Smartwool products and would have liked these gloves had they not torn along the seam on the wrist the first time I used them. I don’t recall being particularly rough with them and they seem to fit ok, so I would say the durability is severely lacking. I’ve had two pairs of these gloves and both have had the exact same flaw. Unfortunately it has been predominantly the right hand of both, so I can’t even mix match them to make one good pair. Pics attached of both pairs for reference. For the price, I expect more."
1.0,I like to return it because it’s too small for my son
1.0,The band broke the second day I wore it. Piece of crap.
1.0,"The material is extremely rough, especially at the elastic parts (waist and ankle). I would not be able to wear these without skin irritation. For the price I thought they would be better quality."
1.0,These had bent frames and marred lenses upon arrival. Sending back
1.0,Turned colors on the second day.  Very disappointed!
1.0,This is so so so dissapointing. Ordered for mothers Christmas present. So cheaply made. Zipper came ripped. Returning
1.0,Fit small for a XL
1.0,Poorly made. Came warped and unusable. Had to return.
1.0,I ordered this skirt in April. I saved it for fall use & today (9/11/2020) when I pulled it out to wear...it has what looks like dried fingernail enamel on waist of skirt. I know I am past return window...but would LOVE to talk w/ someone regarding this
1.0,My toddlers bent these glasses immediately and now won’t stay on face. Wouldn’t buy again.
1.0,"The belly ring looks nice. The metal has a nice<br />appearance and the stone was clear. However, within four days the bar fell off of the ring! Very disappointed!!"
1.0,Cheap looking. Returned.
1.0,The shirt is super cute but the first day i wore it i was adjusting the really long strings and the metal rings around the holes fell out of their places
1.0,"The sizing is WAY off on this one. Also, the material is horrible. Glad it was relatively cheap but can’t return it since it’s past the window of time to do so. The quality of a lot of things has substantially gotten worse, and I hate leaving bad reviews but I have just done 6 of them today. Mass production is clearly affecting quality. 😕"
1.0,"These are likely &#34;Chinese&#34; or Asian sized items. They can't be standard American sizing and conversion from Chinese sizing if significantly off. I am used to that happening, therefore I ordered a 1X hoping it would work for me...I'm a 12. These were tiny."
1.0,Very difficult to unlock with small lever on buckle.
1.0,Cute on model but looked terrible on me and felt cheap
1.0,"This is the worst thing I have bought off Amazon,  It is so small its for a kid. And it says 14k Gold, It is not 14k Gold. It is maybe gold filled or plated but not 14k Gold. Also it is so hard to fasten once you get it on you have to have help. very cheap looking . I contacted them but I have not heard anything back. I do not suggest you buy anything from these people."
1.0,The product that was delivered was a black hat. It was not red at all. I returned it.
1.0,"Almost, I can see it. It is very very tiny!!!"
1.0,Wasn't the right size
1.0,Completely see-through! Very cheap & flimsy fabric. Feels like something you would buy at a costume store. I was hoping to use these for my Beetlejuice Halloween costume and I saw some of the bad reviews (which are basically the same as mine) but had hoped it was just a person by person basis. Not true! DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,This product doesn’t look like the picture says it’s red but is almost brown. Was expecting a cute outfit I could wear to a concert but got a set that feels like a shower curtain and is such a hideous color. Very disappointed had a lot of hope for this.
1.0,"Top does not hang well, material looks super cheap and is too short."
1.0,"Brought as a gift,  opened a way too small, she's 5'5 187lb."
1.0,Very disappointed.  The color wasn't near the color advertised.
1.0,"Its too short for me, makes my belly look even bigger. Super cute though."
1.0,I order it specifically because it said a wrap dress. IT IS NOT a wrap dress. I am returning it for this reason. Once out of package I realised it was not a wrap dress I didn't even try it on so I can't help will how it fits.
1.0,I hate it when I order an Asian article...seriously this women's medium is small on a ten year old kid. Errr
1.0,"Tire mi dinero, pésima calidad"
1.0,"Not great fabric and not well made, I returned immediatly."
1.0,"So cheaply made- funny, bad odor - takes forever as it ships from CHINA- horrible. Impossible to return. Had to appeal to Amazon to get a refund. Aviod this CHINA  made  product and all items shipped from China!!!. Not even one star"
1.0,Doesn't look or feel like it will last through one laundry cycle.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, earrings would not go through the hole in my ear and it made my ear sore trying to get it to go through.  It’s pretty,but I would not recommend."
1.0,These seem cheap.  Strap broke right away.  Would not recommend.
1.0,The zipper broke the first time I use it.
1.0,Far too little fabric alloted in the chest area. If you are flat chested it might work and look super cute.
1.0,very small doesn't look as appear
1.0,This jacket literally is so small even when i ordered a Large and it’s advertised as oversized. it looks like a slim fit men’s jacket and the zipper isnt<br />even the correct color from the photos.
1.0,Post are twisted and you can't get them in your noise
1.0,"It's tiny which I expected and wanted, but there is barely any definition to the pinecone. It looks like silver lumps, or like a bundle of grapes instead of a pine cone. I know you get what you pay for.. so I guess what I'm saying is don't waste your money!"
1.0,I wear small and this was too tight around arm and chest area. You need a tank top under the dress because the dress has holes I thought had a nude fabric underneath but it did not and it does look it’s a cheap dress
1.0,Awful quality.
1.0,Returned<br />Smelled like plastic.
1.0,"I put these on and at first no problem but through out the day they became very uncomfortable.  It was like a vice was pinching my ear, I had to remove them.  Would not recommend these."
1.0,Didn't fit as expected. Not really bleached.
1.0,Horrible quality. So thin when you where them you can see it stretching.
1.0,"The leather broke a week after I bought it, then the metal clasp broke. Piece of junk and waste of money."
1.0,Definitely doesn’t look like the picture. Sides are more pointy and hang funny. I’m 5’3” and 125 pounds. Even my daughter said it looked odd. It hangs awful on your body.
1.0,Shoes had great packaging and looked cute at first. I tried them in and walked around my house and quickly realized that the material they are made of is extremely flimsy and would not hold up to any sort of wear.
1.0,Does not fit as expected. Horrible
1.0,"Are you kidding me, a bicycle chain would look more legit than this weak small chain, the picture is not how the chain you will get looks, buyer beware. Of course the price is right for this garbage 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
1.0,"This product for not in house.<br />Maybe good for outdoor.<br />Too thick, heavy."
1.0,"Nice purse, advertised as light."
1.0,So these may be a defective batch or just bad design but the post can screw on and off on both ends but it gets stuck an awful lot. I have one stuck in my ear now because it got stuck spinning and spinning and tried to tug it apart gently as I was spinning and the plastic broke off. Now I have the metal post stuck in my ear because the very stuck spinning metal bits won't budge and I can't get a good grip on it. I may have to have the post cut out of my ear...
1.0,"Had to return the product because it did not block any noise, i still heard some of the smallest sound so maybe it is good at reducing noise at about only10% for me, it felt tight on my ears & was very uncomfortable,"
1.0,It was not worth the money!  The material is cheap and poor quality!!!!
1.0,"Yikes. My daughter was really excited about this umbrella but right out of the package I was disappointed. The plastic is super thin and the metal hinges looked as they would break quickly. She opened it up and tried to close it, which was no easy task and ended with two cuts in her fingers. Terrible quality."
1.0,"I purchased this purse as a Christmas gift for my mother in law. She loved the purse and right away started using it, but within a month the lining of the purse started to rip and the gold design on the outside of the purse started to fall off. She loved the color and the amount of room she has in the purse she evening loved the complements, but she had to stop using it because it continued to fall apart."
1.0,Bought 3x because I wanted it a little bigger. Couldn’t get my arms through
1.0,Horrible. Star side of earring attached backwards. Put them in the trash. Save your money and don’t buy these cheaply made earrings.
1.0,"I orderedq 2xl ..im 5'10"" 200lbs...fits like a medium before a wash, I normally get a xl in other shirts but want a loose fit"
1.0,Fell apart when I attempted to attach it to a sweater.
1.0,These are huge. No way to get it to stay up. Would not recommend
1.0,Way to long and broke the next day.
1.0,These things stared to smell like melting plastic and got hot enough to cause burns. These are not safe.
1.0,These are super cute but cheap. I bought these for my nephew when he comes to visit me. He wears them only indoors for a short amount of time. He’s had these for leas than a month and they already have a hole by the toe area
1.0,Very big in size not suitable as pendent on neck
1.0,I returned them because it says they are 10k gold on the box it was supposed to be 14k
1.0,My wife loves this dress. The reason for the one star is there was a tiny hole on the back that she didn't notice until after she removed the tag. After one wash the whole has gotten bigger. It is right on the backside area so she can't wear it again.
1.0,"The band itself looked nice, however it was never used as the latching mechanist that connects the fitbit to the strap broke before it was ever able to be used. Some spring fell out of it and there is no way to make it work without. You should not buy this product."
1.0,This band does not fit the Moto 360 Gen 2
1.0,I put the sock on and it tore. The fabric used to make the sock is not strong.
1.0,"You might as well buy a pair of mittens at the dollar store....and cut the fingers off. I thought the neoprene material would be akin to what a neoprene knee/elbow sleeve is. But, this item lack support if you need stability with a finger."
1.0,"Quite pretty, but every stone was lose.  The center stone popped out the first day."
1.0,"Did not like them. Horrible fit and horrible material. They don’t look like how they are advertised. I will be returning them, unfortunately 👎🏾"
1.0,"I bought a size medium and it was too tight, I’ve gotten multiple medium hoodies but I’m not sure why the size runs different."
1.0,After only a week and a half of carrying my 11 keys it broke. I got a new one with a different company made out of Kevlar and after a couple months it's still going strong!
1.0,"I purchased a size UK/US 38G.  Not sure if this was a sports bra or swimwear but there was not much support for either, even with the underwire and J-hook. The shoulder straps are semi-adjustable, but with a large chest I needed more adjustment to get uplifting support.  Overall I liked the look of the bra but not the fit."
1.0,The only reason this product has 5 stars is because this seller gives a $40 Amazon gift card if you rate it with 5 stars. It does not work. Leaves spots on glasses and is NOT fog proof.
1.0,very fake looking
1.0,Tried to use as a COVID mask. Very tight (adult male with large neck) and wouldn’t stay up. Couldn’t talk with it falling down.
1.0,These are just plastic beads. 🙄
1.0,I didnt care for these. Cheap looking. I am returning.
1.0,I was really looking forward to these earrings.  You really do get what you pay for.  These were $3.48 and post earrings with the posts twisted sideways so that they are unwearable.
1.0,When u start to sweat the material irritates the skin and it broke me out made me itch I had to give it a star but didn't want to give it one at all
1.0,The sweater part fit well bu the arms are for a monkey... they are much too long and the material is flaky too.
1.0,Returned this item as it was too large. Also very shear fabric.
1.0,I wear a size 12 N this top in a large was strangling me.
1.0,The material was horrible felt awful couldn’t wear for sure
1.0,I know what I am so disappointed !!!!of all the bathing suits I bought this one was my daughters favorite and on the first day !! The first day the straps burst off!! It’s a good thing I have this thing about bring extra clothes thank good no one saw she was horrified Oo and did I mention she is 12!!!
1.0,"Don't get , CHEAP"
1.0,First time wearing them and they got all the little balls and pile ups on them
1.0,"Not a great hoodie, really thin and cheap material had to return it"
1.0,The threading on this item came unraveled after first use. Very disappointed
1.0,"Made in China, therefore, Not true to size, I wear size small to medium & this dress, medium, doesn’t even fit a small person. Poor quality."
1.0,Order up in size! Bought a size 12 and it was 3 inches too small to zip in back! BEAUTIFUL dress & GREAT quality! Sad I have to return! Suggest ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you are!
1.0,"Not regular workout pant material! Shows every single bump and ripple and cellulite, no way I’m wearing them outside of my house. They are soft, but beyond unflattering."
1.0,Cute shirt and well made but way too small.  I ordered a XL and it looked like a kids XL.  Gave it to a very petite girl at work.
1.0,Horrible. No grip. Slippery. My last pair of juzo gloves lasted 3 yrs while this one hit the trash in 4 wks.
1.0,Material felt good in my hands but I could not fit the sizes sent me. Had to return them all. They run very small
1.0,I have bad planter fasciitis in my right foot and was hoping these would be a good solution for a shoe to wear around the house. Wore them for a few hours and both feet were hurting.
1.0,"I bought this to add a keypad to my Liftmaster MyQ garage Door opener.  I currently have 2 clickers, 2  vehicles, and a MyQ hub working with my door.  The MyQ hub was recently added without issue.  I opened the box of the GD-R 36, installed the battery and followed the initialization instructions packaged with the device.  The device failed register a code with the opener.  Several attempts yielded no positive results.  I watched the video in the GarageStore.com site.  And attempted to sync the unit using those different instructions.  No Bueno.  I contacted support chat and verified the unit was the correct unit for my yellow learn button opener.  Was instructed to remove battery, wait for an hour and try to sync again.  1 hr later same failed results. Contact chat support and they told me it was a frequency incompatibility with my 2016 LiftmasterMyQ Security2.0 opener.  They imediatly offered a return option thru Amazon.  I returned unit and bought a Liftmaster unit from Home Depot which immediately synced with my opener the way you would expect.  Either the GD-R36 unit was incompatible, labeled incorrectly, or defective.  No matter, it did not work"
1.0,"Very disappointed with this pool float.  Inflated, put in pool, got on and within 10 minutes there was a hole in the right arm.  I removed it and then the left side to find out that the strap on the left had come away from the main body.  Maybe I got a bad one but I suggest that you keep looking."
1.0,The plastic frame gets fragile from the day I got hold of this kids sunglasses. It was not even worn on a daily basis. It was a beautiful piece fresh from its box but it doesn’t last even just for a three months. Highly NOT recommended z
1.0,Came in broken...
1.0,Please just be aware they are so tiny they don't even wrap around an earlobe. I think they would be more suited for a small toddler than an adult.
1.0,Definitely not snowboarding goggles. Took them to Colorado and they fog like crazy and droplets stick to the lenses and blur vision. Spend the money to get a real pair; I had to when I was on vacation and it made a world of difference!
1.0,"I purchased these for my son on March 26th, they are now, as of April 29th, unwearable.  We are currently in quarantine and just playing around our home.....he's 5.  There is no reason why a shoe should last one month."
1.0,i specifically ordered plus size socks because i am a little bit bigger how in the world am i supposed to fit a sock that looks like a childs.
1.0,"Sox were too long and gathered both up the leg and at the top, right below the knee!  All places where gathering occurs creates a narrow band and increases swelling instead of displacing it."
1.0,Zipper broke first use
1.0,Smell is strong and toxic that the masks are unwearable
1.0,"I traditionally wear a XXL. This size gives me plenty of room in the chest and stomach normally. If i want a more snug fit, I go with an XL<br /><br />When it comes to this item, the XXL fits more like a L. Don’t waste your money if you’re a bigger guy."
1.0,they were way to tight in the calf
1.0,This umbrella closed with difficulty since the day we bought it and broke within 2 weeks.  Absolutely NOT worth the money.
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl. It fits like a large. It doesn’t run slightly small, it runs EXTREMELY small."
1.0,Ripped after one wear.
1.0,Not true to size and very poorly made. Do not recommend this vest.
1.0,I can barely see out of them...? Seems as though there is prescription at the top. I can actually see a bit better when worn upside down.. Don't waste your money!
1.0,Love this bag but it did not come with the crossbody strap!
1.0,"Sad to say these shoes fit great, feel great...and look great. However they are unusable because they leave black streaks everywhere you walk on hard floors. By the time I noticed it they were all over. Very hard to clean off the black streaks"
1.0,"I bought this for my wife for SantaCon and I can say with absolute confidence, it's absolutely not what is pictured in any way shape or form.  the picture shows something that looks at least mid to mid-high quality, but what we got is down right cheap garbage.  also, in the picture, you can see it's about half as long as what's pictured.  Even the tie is wrong..."
1.0,"Everything about these ""joggers"" is weird. The fabric is weird. The fit is weird. The pockets are weird. Just a strange piece of clothing I won't wear out of the house if I wear them at all."
1.0,I got the oatmeal color and it was completely see-through. Immediately returned. Could’ve been cute in a darker color maybe?
1.0,WAYYYYYY TO BIG! These are made for females
1.0,It was like putting puffy lace sleeves on tee shirt material
1.0,Material feels low grade
1.0,"This purse smelled like cat urine!! It was so bad, I smelled it as soon as I opened the box. I looked, to see if possibly the box had somehow gotten wet, but no, the inside of the packaging was dry as well. It was so bad, I threw it in the trash, ASAP!! Not even worth the trouble to return it for my money back. My house still smells. No, I do not have any pets. I am allergic."
1.0,"Me quedo chico, con la cintura muy alta. No me queda bien. No lo deseo."
1.0,I wont be ordering anything from this supplier again. Very poorly made and it was see through.
1.0,this shirt was more like a medium super diassapointed I should have saved my money
1.0,The hoops are perfect the studs on the other hand are not. They broke my ears out instantly the first day and had to take them out. The hoops have not broke me out at all. So if you have sensitive ears I suggest not trying the studs at all.
1.0,Good quality. Ordered the 52mm lense size. Received 54mm<br /><br />Be careful when you order from this seller
1.0,"said they were wide. They were not wide. Trashed canned them, went to Walmart and picked a better, cheaper pair. I'm starting to get sick of the American business bastard!"
1.0,Terrible fitting. They were huge on me. Looked like jnco jeans. I am returning.
1.0,"I did not like 2 small, and is nothing like what was advertise .  i've been trying to return the item and ut wont even allow the option. Mistake to buy them."
1.0,"I loved these pants, I really did!  They fit perfectly.  They felt great on.  They were flattering!<br /><br />I bought two pairs; green and pink.  They BOTH had streaks from the waist band through the crotch. I returned the pink and asked for an exchange on the green, afraid the same streaks would be present on the exchange.  They were.<br /><br />So sadly it seems the whole batch may have gotten wrinkled during the dying process and that created dark lines through the crotch....and the last thing a woman wants is stains running from her crotch!"
1.0,I want to preface this by saying I really did like this system of waking up the shock gets you up on time every time the app is easy and intuitive to use but after having this device for less than a month and then it suddenly stops zapping it's unacceptable at a $150 price point  I opened it up to see if there was maybe just a contact leave that was no longer touching longer touching and that whole point on one side inside was missing the piece that it mattered to was there but the copper looking springy portion was just gone for a $150 I would like to see some beefed up contact points
1.0,The lenses make my lap top screen all yellow. Makes me dizzy. They will not accept any returns. Do not buy from them.
1.0,"Material is very thin and is sized for adults, not children"
1.0,Ordered a large and is was tight and unflattering
1.0,This was awful... Looked nothing like the picture. Was huge on me and soo not flattering! I felt like i just put on a painting smock...
1.0,"This is youth size, not for adults. There's no exchange option and they charge you to return. If you normally order small, you'd need to order large or even extra large. Disappointing."
1.0,The flowers were a different color. The dress was too long and the top part does not hang loose as shown. I had to alter it a ton..
1.0,Bottom was too big and I ordered a medium. My bottom is quite large so was surprised it was a bit big.
1.0,"Although I adhered to the size chart listed by the company, the dress was too small in the bust. The item arrived 2 days late. The material was excessively wrinkled, not very good quality, and not like it was pictured. Very disappointed. I returned item, and received a timely refund."
1.0,"Very bulky and not the best color metals. Clasps are to large for normal ring and clasp of all my necklaces, so they essentially don't fit."
1.0,Too small and didn't like the fabric
1.0,Logo on shirt was totally off centered.
1.0,"see the title, says it all."
1.0,"NOT what I expected at all! The paint looks good, it is sturdy and it is durable, but the tip is large half circle looking and the paint is grey-brown. I would not purchase this item unless you don't mind a cheap looking knock-off wand. Snake's eyes aren't detailed, skeleton is not detailed, and it's awkward to hold. Definitely consider continuing your search for this type of wand."
1.0,This one is not new one..<br />I think used one
1.0,The worst fitting shoe I ever owned I wore them once and now I have to give them away. They would not stay on my foot felt like I was going to fall all the time
1.0,Way too small the large is more like a small
1.0,Not the greatest material and looked like the picture in the sense of having the same design but was unshapely more like a sheer nightgown may be able to work it with a belt but I ended up giving it away to my sister who is bigger than I
1.0,Fake smile is on my thighs
1.0,The photos for this product do not show the crystalline structure of ruby. In fact there is zero evidence in the photos to indicate this is corundum (ruby) The product is likely dyed Quartz. It’s unfortunate that these fake items are found on Amazon<br /><br />“Egl” certified means nothing. These imposters print fake certificates of authenticity all day.
1.0,absolute waste of money. not easy like it shows in the picture. would not purchase again.
1.0,"Not what I expected. The material is bad. And fits horrible. Am short 5fy with large breast and work for a mackup Company and always need black to ware, was so excited about the reviews I read but what I got was disappointment. The shoulder straps stretch out when I put it on"
1.0,terrible... it was so small i couldnt even get it past my forearms
1.0,"I bought this for my 4yr old because he is not ready for makeup yet, however this is an adult size mask and it has an awful and strong latex smell making hard to wear for any period of time. Sad he won’t be wearing it for Halloween."
1.0,Received this and it is about several sizes too small
1.0,Dislike 👎🏾 the style but like 👍🏾 the color
1.0,Terrible quality and very strange fit
1.0,La. Parte de atrás del reloj No se veía el mecanismo cómo salía en la muestra ósea tenía tapa de rosca y no la trasparente que era como yo la quería Me disgustó realmente. Gracias
1.0,The print was backwards on the tee
1.0,Would give 0 stars if possible Fit my 3 year old son. Way to<br />Small
1.0,too small for hands to fit
1.0,Watch which hat you click on that you want. the picture does not match with the name.
1.0,My grandbaby love the outfit. I ordered a size up for him it's a 4t and the outfit came in and it looks like a 2t. Guess I should have gone alot bigger.
1.0,These were way to big for me n my husband. Great quality n well made but won’t stay up.
1.0,I would say i have never bought any crappy product than this one. I bought it in november end to gift my mom on Christmas and after using it for two months (not heavily used ) the inner lining was torn there is nothing we can keep in inside it and the zipper also didn’t work. It looked beautiful hence i thought it would make great gift but i am so ashamed of even giving it to her. Another problem with it is the buckle on the belt doesn’t work we can’t it longer or shorter. Even if i do it slides back again so that is useless. I wish i had gone in person to buy a bag and look for quality instead of relying on it here. I was swayed by the compliment given here but its fake
1.0,Purchased in april 2018 and as of July 2018 watch stopped working. Tried changing the battery and still did not work. Very dissatisfied!
1.0,The material of the short set was too thin for me to wear. And the size was more like a small instead of a xl
1.0,Se rompen fácilmente
1.0,"Advertised as ""genuine leather"". That's a falsehood! The cases were made of PVC material. No where in the product description was that mentioned; otherwise, would not have ordered."
1.0,The socks were great for the first 2 weeks for my aqua aerobics and then both socks got a hole in the bottom.
1.0,These kill ur feet!!! Not recommended.
1.0,Looked very cheap. I returned the product
1.0,Had this ordered for sister to use in her clinic as she used to have other good quality brand. Unfortunately this doesn’t even work and return window closed due to travel
1.0,IT IS MISSPELLED!! It says Good Hibes High Tides
1.0,On 1st used they ripped. Not worth it
1.0,"I bought a pair of these sunglasses and really liked them so I bought two other pairs for different vehicles and occasions. However, I took one brand new pair out today. When I took them off to use my cell phone, the right arm snapped near the hinge. The hinge didn't break....the arm did. That seems like very rigid plastic that should be far more flexible. Of course the return window has passed.<br /><br />Edit: all 3 pairs have broken"
1.0,Way too big for a business suit
1.0,First noticed the tightness across the shoulders when tryin to put this on and it went downhill from there.  My guess would be that this would be undersized even if the stated size was actually Euro instead of U.S.<br /><br />Too bad as the material feels nice.
1.0,"I like the fitting of the shorts, but cheap material,,,too many threads coming off"
1.0,"This product fit well from the ribs and up. Then below the waist it was really long , to high at the hips and narrow at the crotch. I couldn’t rerun in time cause I missed the window of time, so I will just hem the bottom and wear with some<br /> Short. Great color though."
1.0,I can’t in good faith give one star.  If you have heavy breast this will not work. The support is none existent. The product as advertised is misleading. Buyer Beware
1.0,It doesn't spin. You can turn it but it sticks. It doesn't actually spin however. It is made thin and not of high quality. Maybe a younger teenager would like it and be ok just turning it by hand.
1.0,"Had to return these for me and also my 5 year old didn’t like them. Important Note: The nose piece is a hard and sharp edge inflexible plastic. I have a well defined Nose (big nose) and I can’t even put these on without it instantly pressing a sharp edge into the bridge of my nose. The back of the goggles have and unnecessary cheap hard plastic clip connecting and opening two size straps, it’s not needed and seems like it will fail in the end, but it’s also uncomfortable. It’s a bummer to slam this product but I can’t even wear it."
1.0,"Don’t really like it, but wear it around the house"
1.0,"I've never owned Quay sunglasses before so I'm not sure if they authentic, but mine broke in my purse about two weeks in. The quality is cheap and the screw just popped out the side after two weeks of wear."
1.0,It looks absolutely gorgeous but I didn't receive it.
1.0,Too small and sharp edges!!!
1.0,Hate it
1.0,Don't buy! One ear came flying off. Bought a second set and one ear came flying off again. The ears r not secure.
1.0,"They don't change,  they're just lighter sunglasses."
1.0,"Cute cotton jammies. However, they are way too small. My daughter is 3, tall and thin. I ordered a 4T and I can barely pull them over her head and her butt sticks out of the top of the pants."
1.0,These were not the size stated. The length was about 4 inches short!!
1.0,"The lenses are great, frame looks nice.<br />Except you must have the face of an elephant.<br />That is how big the glasses 🕶️ are.<br />Huge.... extremely too big."
1.0,"I ordered this and LOVED it. After less than a week of normal wear it began to unravel and fall apart. At the low price I didn't expect to carry it to my grave, but I at least expected it to last a few months."
1.0,Hahahaha!!!!  Shipping is more than the hat. Liberal socialism at work!!!!
1.0,"These have a pretty design, although they are one-sided.  They do not hang correctly from the ears, not comfortable and I have quit wearing them altogether."
1.0,It was labeled an adult watch. It might fit the average 5 year old. Misleading. It sucks!
1.0,"Electrified, after the first wash, the patterns on the sleeves are damaged"
1.0,Don't  buy it waste of money.
1.0,In the dark you can't read anything.
1.0,The product was HORRIBLE!!!!
1.0,Very bad quality. Was damaged after just an hour of wearing
1.0,"Its a nice bracelet, but i don't think there are magnets or negative ions or any of that. Just seems like painted colors. Which means one wouldn't get any of the listed therapeutic benefits."
1.0,I didn't like anything about this dress. It looked nothing like the picture. It was sent back.
1.0,I hated it. Looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,Not Comfortable  Returned 😕
1.0,"They're beautiful. Sadly, mine arrived broken"
1.0,My husband said it  was too big and bulky. It didn't fit right.
1.0,Battery’s didn’t last very long like a couple hours if that
1.0,"Returned the set for a refund.  I got an xs and the bottom fit great but the top was way too loose.  I am 5ft 1 and 100lbs with a small chest, which might account for the mismatch."
1.0,It was nothing like what I ordered don’t bother
1.0,"I loved the way this looked however the smell was so bad when I opened the box, and then the plastic bag that was around the purse there was a strong odor of Moth balls. I saw it came from China and I have had this smell show up on other products that were made in China as well. As I said I loved the purse so I took it out of the plastic and put it out on our screened in porch hoping that it would air out. I left it to air out for a week and it never did loose the smell of moth balls!! So, I sent it back and will be sure I do not buy any other product from Vincico."
1.0,It broke immediately.
1.0,"I ordered largest size because it said &#34;runs small&#34;,<br />The XXL must be made for an extr large toddler!<br />It is TINY!!  Don't buy it unless you are a small tween.  Too bad because it's a cute shirt!"
1.0,even when straps were adjusted the top was too large.  I am a 38 C so I'm not tiny.  I ordered a medium.
1.0,The product chain broke within a week
1.0,these are low cut and short
1.0,"The bracelet appears to be made of a chain with beads on it, but hidden under the beads is a cheap string that breaks and falls apart very easily."
1.0,"Poorly made, cheap material"
1.0,"Except for the color, this was nothing like the picture., the breast cups were tiny and shaped really weird, plus it fit extremely loose around the midriff. Didn’t work for me at all."
1.0,"Does not look like the picture,"
1.0,"Did not open this right off the bat, time ran out to return. This is very poor quality. Not worth the money at all."
1.0,Very disappointed in this item when I received it  was broken and damaged and in pieces it is a birthday gift for my 14 year old daughter this Christmas.
1.0,My son only wore twice never in rain and one of the shoes led isn't working
1.0,Very disappointed. Only 2 out of 7 pairs worked. 1 of each earrings worked for 5 minutes and then didnt stay lit at all. My students were very disappointed! Would give zero stars if I could.
1.0,Printed patch; not embroidered
1.0,Very Flimsy  not  sturdy
1.0,"Horrible, came flat and cheap!"
1.0,Horrible product ! Definitely for huge nipples 😡 very disappointed . Heart way better than expected as well
1.0,"I was exited to receive these pants as I live where it gets very cold in the winter. I would see myself using these when I plow the driveway, errands, they look nice. However when I put them on I was immediately confused. First of all I went to their size info chart. I am a 36 waist and 34 length. Their chart seems a bit off so I choose the size 34 as that is a 36.2 waist, but does not give you a length. The size 36 waist would have been way to big. So I put them on and the waist was a bit form fitting, more like a 34 or 35 waist (mens). Then the length which we did not know really, looked like a 32. So way to short (floods). SO the size was off for me. Then came the material. When it said Micro fleece lined, I was sure I would get a decent layer. Folks, it was paper thin. If I was outside in the cold I would freeze to death. Then came the zipper pockets. They were like a reverse zip, and awkward to use. The legs were tight in the thighs. I did not even take pictures as it have looked terrible. All in all I did not like these pants."
1.0,Some earrings were missing and some were misplaced. And it turned my ears red.
1.0,The fabric is like old double knit polyester.  It is way too big.
1.0,"This item is cute, love the over-sized style BUT it's very cheaply made!  This sweater snags incredibly easily and after wearing once there was already a hole.  Returned and will not purchase again."
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter and she like the style and fit, but unfortunately after 2 weeks of wearing them, the heels collapsed and I had to throw them out, they looked as if she had worn them in battle for 3 years. The heels are hollow inside, the boots in general are not made of quality materials."
1.0,I ordered the next size up as the statement says to and the hoodie is still to small. I would recommend ordering 2 sizes bigger
1.0,Way too short. Not as pictured. Very disappointing. Other than that it is cute.
1.0,Super thin cheaply made no support. Don’t waste ur money
1.0,"All of my earrings were coming a loose, see pictures for references. Colors are beautiful, but all of them were coming a part."
1.0,"poorly made, not symmetrical eye holes, un-trimmed strings. look for something better. non-returnable"
1.0,I ordered a small and it is literally SO big.. I'm sure my family of three could all get into it and still have room to share. 🤦🤣 Luckily I got it on sale and it's now a gift that I hope doesn't offend because legit... SO big. I should have ordered an extra extra extra extra small.
1.0,nothing like the photo
1.0,It's a hole on the leg
1.0,Only eight out of forty worked right out of the box! Something is wrong with the switches because if you pinched the room light really hard I could get another two or three to work
1.0,Fabric looks old and size was very small . I did not return as there is no longer a return tag in the Amazon orders is I do not order as often ☹️
1.0,"No good the magnet for the money clip sucks, be lucky to hold two dollars. Can't use it, again no good"
1.0,The quality of this item was lacking.  The &#34;peace&#34;  symbol  not only small but the material is flimsy.  I  returned this as I know I can get better value at a major department store for  the money I spent on this bracelet.
1.0,I like the fleece lining and fitted cuffs
1.0,Such a crappy material
1.0,way too small I ordered an xl probably the size of a M
1.0,One pair broke within three days of using.
1.0,The price size was cute and what I expected. But I bought this purse for a performance and needed to be as pink as the picture and it wasn't it was more a pink champagne very very light pink. Returning
1.0,"If in the taller side, thos is not for you."
1.0,Material feels like a cheap plastic table cloth.
1.0,Rubber and made in China
1.0,"Pretty earrings but after a few hrs of wearing something told me to look in the mirror......red, swollen ear lobes. Still swollen & sore now after 24 hrs. Better but not back to how my ears were before wearing.<br />Arrived on time & wrapped well."
1.0,"Has no room for tightening, no stretch."
1.0,"This bracelet is hard to put on, and with my small wrists it's basically impossible."
1.0,"I love this company. I have ordered multiple pieces of jewelry from them over the past year. I am so disappointed in this piece. The main Center stone is literally half the size of my pinky nail. The three tiny stones leading up the side can barely be seen.While I do believe it is well-made, I think this is best suited for a child and not a grown woman. I’m all about dainty jewelry, but this is so small it’s silly. I’m so disappointed, and will reconsider before buying anything else from them in the future."
1.0,The first time I used it the inner fabric of each compartment completely unravelled and was like shredded.
1.0,"The posts are too thick that they hurt my earring holes. I recommend them if you are trying to transition into getting gages or tunnel plugs, but definitely not for regular ear piercings. Not what I expected."
1.0,Didn’t even see stick the first use
1.0,I pulled these out of the package and looked at one of them and the end piece fell off. That would be catastrophic if I was on a boat and that happened!  Pay more for better quality.
1.0,Cheap quality I would not buy again.
1.0,It’s nothing like the picture.  Cheap quality and poor design.  Did not arrive by first expected date and couldn’t use it for the event I wanted for.  It’s a perfect example of what you expect vs. what actually you get.  The top doesn’t have a dip like pictures show but rather a straight cut. Also the hoodie is mighty odd.  Save yourself the disappointment and don’t buy it
1.0,Cheap metal - blunt end- could not even get in my ear. All lengths were the same - not as specified in the description. Returned.
1.0,Too small and looks cheap
1.0,Material is shinny polyester. Very cheaply made. Nothing like the picture shown. Disappointed
1.0,Material was completely see through.
1.0,Looks extremely cheap when you actually get it. Was supposed to be a special gift for my mom and was a huge disappointment when it arrived
1.0,"Three sizes to small, from listed size"
1.0,Way too small. Will just fall out my piercing hole.
1.0,I bought these to be a base layer while cycling this winter. When I opened the package the smell was so awful my wife had to come into the room and see where it was coming from. It’s been washed in 3 detergents now and it’s finally gone. They also offer zero compression. They may see like a good deal but when they end up not doing their job it’s a huge waste.
1.0,This is a worthless product! Worked for one day then no longer connects. Also it doesn't work with 5g
1.0,"This 4-pack included masks that were to be the same size. Only three of the masks were actually large enough for my youngest son (age 7) to wear. Only 2 of the masks were large enough for my old kids to wear (ages 9 and 11). My kids are not above average in size by any means.  The fourth mask was so small that my kids thought it was an arm band. The fabric on some of the masks is rougher than others. If I hadn't been in a hurry to have extra masks, I would have returned them."
1.0,Didn't work with my watch even though in description said it would. Very disappointed
1.0,"I ordered a 52&#34; belt, I got a 50&#34; belt.  A 50&#34; belt that requires 3.5&#34; of belt length just to make it to the first latch.<br />This means that even if I got the right length belt, it would still be 1.5&#34; too short to work.<br />This is something they should clearly warn about when it comes to sizing!!!<br /><br />For anyone considering ordering, just remember to add 5.5 inches to your waist size!<br />But be careful, there is only 9 inches of adjustments.  Probably does effect most people, but I'm a large guy who gains and loses weight at the cyclic rate!"
1.0,That product was so ugly and did not look like the photo at all. Do not buy this! It was make poorly and when I tried to return it I was told I would have to pay for the return shipping and they would only refund my 50% of what I paid! Horrible to deal with and the material they made it with was cheap and see through!
1.0,Cheaply made not good quality
1.0,this product was for my toddler who is in 2t and its so small
1.0,"Well .... I had to order this twice cuz the 1st time , it came out the package that’s not even the half .... this crap cleaner messed up my air max cones . They are bleeding now . I will never ever order this again"
1.0,Never have I had an issue with nylons but these ones make my feet break out in horrible rashes and swell!  I don't recommend these to anyone....
1.0,Sad
1.0,Junky plastic and i had order me dit back in March<br /><br />It took 3 months to come
1.0,The white tassels came apart after one wash and caused a disaster!!
1.0,This shirt/blouse was made for a kid. There’s no way an adult has the shoulder to boob length necessary to fit this blouse!! I returned it
1.0,The bolts are too short to fit even a size 8 hat...far from what was advertised to 9 1/2... Having to go look for bolt extensions to make it work...<br /><br />Do NOT waste your money
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday and she only wore it a few times and the middle part just fell right off, it is not on very good. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to that one. It also says that the pendant is double sided in the description but it is not. Instead it says something dumb on the back ""You Beat You Land""."
1.0,Works great but size is way off. Ordered a 2XL followed measurements and it fits a mans medium. So hubby lost out but son got a new heat vest.
1.0,Bote el dinero
1.0,"I chose this wallet as a gift because it appeared to be more sturdy craftsmanship and thought it was more expensive than several others, it was my final choice.  What a mistake that was!  It took approximately 3 weeks for the clasp to break and the friend to whom it was given is using a strong rubber band to keep it closed.  It is a good looking wallet but it certainly did not meet my expectations especially as a gift item.  It was embarrassing to have that happen."
1.0,"Disappointed to say the least, so small and cheaply made it should have sold for no more than 5.00, buyer beware"
1.0,Ok yes they are super cute BUT unfortunately they break right away and come loose and it is just sad.  I really wanted to love them
1.0,"Just don’t buy super flimsy and it’s not a real pocket, I’m plus size and thought it would fit around me it didn’t."
1.0,Color was great but band was very difficult to remove from the watch body.  I struggled removing it.  I refuse to use it again because how  difficult it was tacking it off. I had to almost break it off.
1.0,Cute dress but completely see through and very then.
1.0,Didnt fit like the picture shows and i got a bigger size too
1.0,"The rings are cute, but extremely tiny. My fingers are average size, and I could not get them past my nail cuticle on any finger except my pinkie finger."
1.0,"Not very toddler friendly. And the color wasn’t as neon yellow as I thought, it’s just yellow. And the arms stretched out after a couple of uses and doesn’t fit in my daughters head anymore"
1.0,Came with one blade cracked where it attaches along the hand grip. Son is very sad.
1.0,Ordered this twice. First one never came so I cancelled order and ordered another one. Came super late and it was the wrong size. Ordered a small and received a medium. These are kid sizes btw. Quality of fabric is horrible and is made with very cheap iron on sticker that will damage in wash in no time. If I could give a zero I would. For what I paid...its not worth it. But thats what I get for buying Chinese made... Will only buy made in USA from now on. You live and learn. Don't buy this crap
1.0,Too tight at the opening to get the proper sized foot in
1.0,glasses have a bad reflection on the inside when wearing them. Very distracting .
1.0,Wanted to love it. But it definitely don’t work to get cards out of atm.  I suggest adding a grip/teeth to the clip to be able to grab better.
1.0,"it will not flatter or fit good.  i would not recommend  this at all to anyone.  I bought two as gifts  for different  ladies and lets just say its delicate to comment to a woman. However, this is so horrid it made the truth allot easier."
1.0,Looks great but too small so it won’t stay slid into the watch. Doesn’t fit genuine Apple Watch.
1.0,"Ordered small, was too tight. Returned and ordered medium. Fit same as small. Returned and ordered large which fit same as small and medium."
1.0,This product is already peeling. The quality is not good. I want a refund.
1.0,Garbage!!!
1.0,Horrible make. Toothpick to connect the earrings to ear could slice inside piercing. Buyers beware
1.0,Does Not provide compression. Does provide warmth if only needing to stay warm.
1.0,"Estaba tan emocionada con este brazalete, era un regalo para mi mamá, pero cuando llegó hasta vergüenza me dio mostrárselo. Es demasiado rígido, casi imposible de poner.<br />No pierdan su dinero con esta porquería.🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️"
1.0,This product does NOT fit as expected at all. I wear a size 14 jeans. I ordered the xxl and they still don’t fit right!! The waist is very small and the butt and legs are huge. Waste of money.
1.0,"I got this with two rips in the waist area, lots of loose strings and a hem coming undone. Terrible quality, didnt even try it on. Not worth the hassle of buying then returning. Do NOT recommend!"
1.0,I got these and I knew immediately that they were too small. I went to return them and the seller had a no return policy. Money down the toilet.
1.0,I look like a whale in this thing called a suit dress.its like wearing curtins.
1.0,I didn't like the cut of these boots. They were way too wide at the ankle making the foot area very short. They were very cute and I was hoping so much that they would be my favorite pair of boots
1.0,Ordered up two sizes like it it said to on the reviews and it is still very small
1.0,The necklace didn’t fit my slender neck tightly enough and it was difficult to put on. I wore the bracelet for an hour before it fell off due to the clasp breaking. I gave it to my daughter to play dress up with and it’s still falling apart. I find pieces of it everywhere. The earrings were okay - just a little heavy for my ears.
1.0,"It doesn't look like the picture very cheaply made, I returned it."
1.0,"I ordered this towel after purchasing the yellow one. I simply wanted to have another one, just a different color. Boy, was I wrong! This one is so much thinner than the yellow. It lacks any kind of absorbency. Love the size, hate the quality."
1.0,Necklace came broken and not fixable. Never buy again.
1.0,"Thin, rips easily"
1.0,"I got this at a great deal and the product is good. The tag was removed from the romper, how do I know it is a new product? I have purchased lilly Pulitzer items from sellers on Amazon before and they never remove the tag. Seems sketchy, I mean why remove the tag..."
1.0,It broke before I could use it. Very disappointed.
1.0,It didn't fit.
1.0,Biggest piece of crap ever. Was so excited and got it and the pockets are so deep your card just disappears! Waste of money! Would give 0 stars if I could!
1.0,"I was searching for a bonnet that I could wear at night to protect my hair, this bonnet looks perfect, however I decided to change my mind on purchasing as I am very offended by the blackface on the model. I will look for another seller to purchase a bonnet."
1.0,Used a paper towel with water to wipe away dust and teal is fading to white. Company nor amazon will help resolve this matter. Amazon says return it and the company says its past the return date.
1.0,Tight on chest
1.0,"This item looked nice and was the size I wanted, but it broke after just 4 uses.  The entire metal clasp fell off.  :("
1.0,I ordered a large 12 to 14. My daughter is 14 and it cannot pass her leg. The sizes are not accurate.
1.0,"I regret buying these bracelets more than you can know. I purchased a set of gold and silver bracelets and less than 1 month and $60 later, I only have 3 bracelets left. I have little wrists so it’s not like they are getting stretched out. Very disappointing."
1.0,Color was not as depicted. The brown was a tan and tacky looking
1.0,"not silk, it's cheap polyester. Misleading"
1.0,"First, this is very poor quality.  Look like it will last 2 washes.  The cut and design is just off.  I have already sent this back."
1.0,Suck. Very cheap
1.0,Broke within the first week of having them. Never again!
1.0,Poor quality I thought it was pressed but it was printed on cheap
1.0,my thighs are muscular so the pants were too small and the embroidery did not help at all.
1.0,These fell apart within 2 days of wearing them. I  guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"Pattern is nice, but I they are fir a large head"
1.0,I would give less if possible. The fabric wasn’t lined up at all. Worst dress ever. Doesn’t look like the picture.
1.0,Second one I bought first broke first day.. Second took 3 days.. Will never get another!
1.0,Material rips very easily. One fits out of three. The two others were so uncomfortable.
1.0,put shirt on and was very itchy feeling
1.0,Got an XL instead of large in the mail :)
1.0,When wearing the small blue star one of the studs came right off in 2 days.<br />Then when I was pulling out the peach colored on the back came right off while taking it out of the box.<br />Should I return these or?
1.0,Per reviews I ordered two sizes up.  Receive item a day later than advised and once received it was obviously too small.  Upon looking at the tag someone hand wrote in the 5 next to the XL.  Returning.
1.0,I opened up the package and 2 of the shirts were already opened and one of them had stains on it like someone returned it already. Will never buy from this brand again!
1.0,The hem at the bottom started to string out right after I opened it..... now it just has frills that I can’t sew up.... this is a terribly made product and I won’t be buying from here
1.0,"The material was cheap, and the seams were crooked. The sizing chart verses the actual product was completely misguided. I ordered an xl after reading other reviews and the XL i recieved looked and fit like a medium. I will be returning. Save your money and do yourself a favor do not buy this shirt!!!"
1.0,"At first I thought I found my maid of honor dress, smh horrible. I bought it after reading the reviews but I want a refund. The dress is huge in the breast area tight around the waist. This was my size according to the chart. It smells like fish the back doeadoes  not stay flat see pictures. No matter what I did pulling up pulling down . I do have a big butt but come on it shouldn't scrunch up like that. Flowers are different than shown too. Dont waste your money. Maybe for someone skinny"
1.0,does not fit
1.0,Cute but not recommended for long term use. It made my daith itchy and green.
1.0,Extremely cheap and broke within 15 minutes. Don't buy.
1.0,Did not fit well at all. Definitely go up a size
1.0,It’s a good price and it’s cotton fabric but it’s so think and uncomfortable fabric. It might be good as winter night dress but I did not like it at all and throw it away after 1 use.
1.0,The stitching on the butt was sewn incorrectly.
1.0,My favorite band out of the bunch broke after only 1 month of regular use.
1.0,"This says spell you, and not I put a spell on you. I am extremely disappointed with this item. Not at all as described!"
1.0,This dress is nice but it's a little small and the straps ripped right off the first time I tried the dress on! I followed the measurements show and I truly am disappointed in the quality of the dress!
1.0,They broke in a week thats how bad it was
1.0,Don't waste time and money. These masks don' fit a regular size adult face. The mask itself is good. The fit is horrible
1.0,I got two &#34;And Beyonds&#34; instead. Not worth the money!
1.0,"As soon as I put them on, one of the ratings broke."
1.0,I’m disappointed in these socks. I love Fallout and bought them because of the game but they are horribly uncomfortable and almost itchy. Sad.
1.0,Very see through. Was too thin and not flattering.
1.0,"Print on the shirt was good, not a paper thin shirt.  I bought this shirt to wear at Disney when we go to Hollywood studios. The shirt fit when I got it, but I was really worried about it shrinking because it was just right.  I hand washed in cold water and hung it to dry.  The shirt shrank at least 3 inches in length, doesn't even get close to fitting any more.  Very disappointed, probably won't be able to get another shirt before our trip.  Would have been nice to have.  Won't buy this again!"
1.0,Awful smell!  It was meant for a gift so I returned it. Seller refunded fast.
1.0,poor quality. The Vinyl on the shirt feel like a piece of plastic just stuck onto a shirt. I will be returning.
1.0,They came with creases and too loos
1.0,Nothing as I expected. The shirt it is like workout material and several different pieces sown together. Super short.
1.0,Ordered a XXL and go more like a size small not even close to being the size it stated.
1.0,these look adorable. But there are a one hit wonder. Pretty much after the first time you wear it it will already have broken.
1.0,This fabric is much cheaper than how it looks pictured...
1.0,Made well and true to size
1.0,"Description says this is a SnapBack, but it is not a SnapBack it is velcro."
1.0,"Ordered the green velvet dress and this crumpled, wrinkled mess came. Wrong style and not even velvet. Thinner fabric than a linen napkin. Absolutely horrendous."
1.0,"Disappointed with purchase .  Bought for my daughters for a Christmas gift., wore one of the pairs one time but they broke.  Purchased early for Christmas so the return time expired."
1.0,"It seems nice and well built, but you can not replace the battery"
1.0,Llegó en muy mal estado con moho terrible y se ve es buena calidad la tela ni se por que llegaron así desepcionante
1.0,The multilayer chain broke before I wore it.
1.0,"Didn't really like how it looks, the fabric is very bad quality, print looks different than on the photo, the entire look is just cheap.<br />I threw it away cause didn't want to bother with sending it back."
1.0,Looks like bleach was poured on them!
1.0,Very large and irregular cut. Nice color
1.0,"Even prior to washing, these were WAYY too tight. Length wise fit perfect, but were the equivalent to skinny jeans in the sweats world.."
1.0,Second hand does not work.
1.0,"Poorly made and constructed hat---material is stiff and extremely uncomfortable. Fit was too large for our newborn. In initial wash the hat was unwearable and ill fitting. It has stretched out and not maintained form. Cannot recommend, unfortunately."
1.0,"This product is not the same as the picture. They are low waisted knee shorts that are thin and smell terribly of what seems to be a petroleum product! Also, the &#34;yellow&#34; is so thin that it is greenish."
1.0,The cups are two small and I have to wear a pad so My body parts are not expised in my blouse.
1.0,"Quality & fit were poor. You’ll have to size up a lot to make it work well and may not make it through 2 washes. Really hoped it was as good as reviews were saying but it’s not. Unfortunately, I was happy to return this one."
1.0,"This belt is not made well at all. The ""leather"" cracked & the belt tore within 2 weeks."
1.0,"This case is quite large as far as how many cards it holds, and I have no doubt it probably hold 40-50 cards, but GOOD LUCK GETTING THEM OUT!!  This was a made in china &#34;POS&#34;... the edges of the card holder are crimped or rolled inward into the case, so once you put your cards in the holder they are very difficult to remove without mangling the card!  I had a superior one of these that was thinner, and made in Germany.  I had it for over 10 years but had to replace it because the spring broke.  Luckily the spring on this import piece of junk fit the old German made high quality one so I replaced it, and have resumed using my old one."
1.0,Sucks. The joke is not funny when there are letters missing.
1.0,looks cool. however the tip came off on day one. also it dose not come with a sleeve to fit my shifter so it spinns. so its a wast of money for me.
1.0,The dress came with yellow stains to the back and down below . I won’t order it again I want a refund or something
1.0,"The band on this bralette is VERY tight and inflexible, making it super difficult to pull on. It looks cute and possibly comfortable... I was hoping it would work, but it's going right back, as I am not a contortionist. Also, the straps are not adjustable."
1.0,Do not purchase this necklace and earrings ! The earrings broke before I even had a chance to wear them and the leopard pieces came out of the necklace before I even had a chance to wear it! Very very cheaply made! Huge disappointment!
1.0,I did not get this item! This scarf appears mint and grey. The scarf I got is white and mint.<br />VERY dissapointed.
1.0,I used for sublimation but they s orched
1.0,I ordered the black and red in a size larger than I usually wear and they fit perfectly. Ordered the mocha and gray in same size but they fit too small.  Will be returning them.
1.0,The little groves scratched the new key housing in replacement keys.
1.0,not good quality.  returned it.
1.0,The inferior fabric and construction resulted in tearing at them same place in two separate pairs of these shorts.
1.0,Didn't fit back of earring wouldn't stay on
1.0,Very cute but the quality is poor.
1.0,"I am curvy and short, naturally. I noticed immediately how heavy the package was. I took them out and they were huge! I am 5 ft 2 and the jeans come up past my breasts when holding them up next to myself. They are legit bigger that my whole body :(. I’ve ordered other jeans on Amazon before so I’m not completely “off”. I was hoping to have a pair of flair jeans that fit. Ah well."
1.0,"Size for a large says 48.8 chest, comes too small- measures a 41."
1.0,Product is listed as 100% poly ester. Collars wrinkle bad after washing. Polyester does not usually wrinkle.
1.0,"Hard to breathe with, very heavy on face and fogs up. I do not recommend"
1.0,Looks stunning at first then after two weeks the plating wears off and you have a brass looking peaking out. You get what you pay for on this one. Such a shame
1.0,Zipper broke after the second wash and it shrunk so it was a weird shape.  Save your money.
1.0,The suit lost power within 20 min
1.0,I bought this backpack for our Disney trip.  I loved the color and sadly it was not worth it. The middle zipper broke when I first unraveled it and the other zipper pockets get stuck or don't close. Big mistake.
1.0,Color was not black more like a  faded Gray color. Made poorly
1.0,"This looks amazing in the picture but it unfortunately was way too small in person. I'm 130 lbs, 5'4 and an A cup and the small fit super awkward but a medium would've been too big so I had to unfortunately return it."
1.0,The fur comes up around your face and continually rubs (not laying flat like in the picture).  There is no closure for the hood so no way to secure it.  The zip also does not go high enough to protect the neck or secure the hood in any way.  Returning as it is useless to stay warm in Chicago winters (wind will blow down the open at the neck).  It also runs large.  I normally wear a medium in clothes but order a large coat so I can wear sweatshirt under it.  This coat was really big even with a sweatshirt.
1.0,Not sure how this fits on small ears. Waste of money
1.0,I bought this one in a bigger size than what I would normally wear because of the reviews saying it run small. I couldn't even get my arms through the arm holes. This might be the perfect size for a 7 year old to fit into. Maybe they should advertise this shirt for children and not adults
1.0,The look and especially the feel of the microfiber made this a no-go for me. I’m going to return it.
1.0,"As much as I wanted to LOVE this shirt, I HATED it. I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear (a US medium). I am y’all with a long torso, do NOT have a big chest, and yet, still too small. Unfortunately when it arrived I was on vacation, and missed my window to return it. So, I guess I have to eat the cost. Order 3 sizes bigger than the normal US size. I think the size range is for oompa loompa’s."
1.0,"First, installing them,  making a tie at the end of the string is ok, but wanted to melt the tips so it doesn't fray because the ends have to be very short for them to fit in the tube.  Then once you get it on, you have to rotate them with the string and it starts to twist up.  Giant pain, cut and run."
1.0,"The actual brim of the hat is only 7 cm, NOT 8.5 cm as stated."
1.0,Wore them for running snow blower o lu used 4 or 5 times before they started ripping between thumb and finger.
1.0,"I really wanted to like this, but I ordered the tan color and got black.  The brim was MUCH larger than it looked in the picture.  It looked horrible on me."
1.0,"The skirt looks nothing like the photo, the quality is bad, the photo shows thick fabric with shape but it is thin and cheap. not worth it. It says A shape but is narrow. I did not like. at the waist it has elastic and that cannot be seen in the photo."
1.0,It was uncomfortable
1.0,The opening was to small
1.0,Cheap material... returned
1.0,"Cheap, don't bother."
1.0,"Returned because it was smaller than stated. It was 7.5 not 8 as advertised, white paint on brown fabric of umbrella in several spots. Fabric pulling away from rod."
1.0,Very cheaply made and I couldn't get the back off to wear it
1.0,"Not sweatshirt material,  cheaply made. I ordered a large and it's probably the size of an extra small. Save your money."
1.0,The dress runs too small. Great dress though
1.0,It wasn't this thick and  I'm sorry I bought it. Maybe I can return it...
1.0,Ran way small not the quality I expected
1.0,"Didn’t like the way it is so clingy.  Didn’t like the material,"
1.0,Fell apart just being hung on the rearview mirror in the car.
1.0,"The location of a toe divider is different on each flip flop, which makes these barely useful (while on one the heel fits on sole, on another the heel hangs out).<br />The foot strip is too short, you have to put efforts to slide the foot in.<br />Also, brand name tag is already half glued - on new flip flops.<br />Just head to aliexpress, the same flip flops are less than a dollar (though the quality will be the same, I guess).<br />Probably, worst quality flip flops I have ever worn."
1.0,The metal hinge in the middle twisted and got the strap loose from first use.  Need to better.  Wasted money
1.0,Poor fit and quality.  Good concept. Bra cups in wrong place.  Returning
1.0,fell apart in a week
1.0,I don't even know what to say. This bra was the worst I've ever bought.
1.0,Arrived with a hole.
1.0,"It was really cute.  However,it broke before I had a chance to wear it.  Extremely disappointing"
1.0,Really cheap material.
1.0,I am a 36D & this medium was not what it claimed to be a 36D! My ass! Maybe a 32D! Or possible 32DD!!!!
1.0,Broken when I received could not give it to my daughter for Christmas 🤬
1.0,Very cheap material and poor stitching.
1.0,Very disappointed with my purchase! I didn’t realize that you get 4 of the same charm. No variety or assortment. This will be marked for return. I do not recommend!!
1.0,"Sizes are not accurate on this page.  The small would fit a toddler, not a youth unless you want a tight half shirt."
1.0,Horrible shouldn’t have one star at all.<br />Wore once and the stitch in the sleeve came completely undone and ripped all the way up the arm. It was a waste of money
1.0,Sizes aren't correct.
1.0,"These are worse than &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. I will be returning to get my $10 back. 2 of them arrived tarnished and changing color, the double chain anklet had 2 loops fused together. I was able to gently pull them apart without damage. In the 2 chain set, one is so long I could never wear it. Just bad. Buy at your own risk."
1.0,Sizing is crazy ridiculously but its to be expected because it's foreign but I mean cmon.. there's no way a 130 lb person should wear a 2XL. It's not worth it. I returned and went to ON and purchased my red flannel.
1.0,"No no no. Inferior quality and no shape at all.  I knew it would be oversized, but the material is so thin that it just hangs. The picture is deceiving as it looks like the sweater is much thicker."
1.0,broke as soon as she put it on make cheap....
1.0,This sweat suit is made for a body... but NOT a body-ody-ody-ody...... XXL fits like a juniors L ... maybe. Junior sizing and super small.  I wear a large/XL womens... but I know better than to not size up on Amazon items.  Their measurements are definitely off on this one.  Unfortunately they don’t make beyond an “XXL”...
1.0,Possibly I ordered the wrong size but who's to know with these jacked up sizing on these?!
1.0,Dont waste your money. Absolute garbage
1.0,One very important word is missing. Don’t bother. Cheap Chinese crap.
1.0,"this item was awful nothing like the picture, bad material, made really short looks like a old horrible rag. please dont buy"
1.0,"I bought 2 for my youngest kids when we had to take a trip out of town and they stayed with my parents and I’m laws. Both broke upon being taken out of the box, so disappointed."
1.0,The pen is not writing properly and cuts automatically while writing. I am disappointed by this. Please send a replacement or refund the amount.
1.0,Zippers constantly come apart. Have lost money out of one side. Key fob was attached in other side so thankfully I didn’t lose it.
1.0,The product is way to small and I ordered 4x
1.0,Bought this as a gift.  It broke after a short time.  Contacted seller regarding warranty and was told I would have to buy another one.  Why would I buy it again if it broke so easily and the buyer doesn't stand behind their product?  Will never buy from them again.
1.0,Not a good product. Wouldn't fit three of out heads
1.0,The design peeled off completely
1.0,"Cheaply made, arrived with broken chain and several stones were missing. Very disappointed<br /><br />Update, I was told that I would be receiving a replacement necklace via email and had attached pictures proving it had a broken chain and missing stones, however, I still do not have what I paid for and it has been over a month."
1.0,Looks worse in person tbh
1.0,This package came opened. The package was very dirty. I reached out to the seller with no response. I don't like the mask. It's made of polyester and is very difficult to breathe in. This type of mask needs some type of ventilation. As you breathe in it sticks to your face. When you breathe out then it releases. It is very difficult to breathe in. Imagine trying to breathe in the mask while you're hot in the sun. I would NOT recommend this mask or seller
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl and water just runs right across it, very small and short. This thing literally gave me Stove handle towel vibes, maybe dry my dishes vibes. I will definitely let my dish rack sit on top of this before I wrap this around my body. It’s literally a regular towel with Velcro."
1.0,I find these earrings to be extremely cheap looking and waaay bigger than expected. I like delicate jewelry & this was NOT it. Returning.
1.0,Dress took forever to get here .. almost thought it was lost in transit. When I finally got it it was cheaply made and not like the picture.
1.0,"Those mass does not have any glitter on it, it’s an image of glitter."
1.0,Stem broke first time I TRIED wear them.
1.0,"you get what you pay for, this band is cheap, comes undone super easy and i almost lost my brand new fitbit"
1.0,"At first I thought I was getting 6 bags since the product was labeled ""New England Patriots 6 Pack Reusable Bags - NFL Football"" but I only got 1 bag.  I see that they changed the product label now.  I've only used my bag a few times and this week it ripped.  I'm not too pleased."
1.0,"Cheap, discolored"
1.0,It broke after 2 times I wore it
1.0,They are very flimsy. They are not strong enough to even go into your nose.
1.0,Broke after first day....not a good buy
1.0,Didn't like anything about it....the cut is horrible
1.0,"I just gave this ring as a birthday gift to my daughter in June and it has already lost a rhinestone. I didn’t expect it to be top-of-the-line, but I did expect it to last longer than a month before falling apart."
1.0,"horrible fabric, I returned it."
1.0,"Instructions in the box say that of they don't fit, email customer service for a free replacement. Did that, no response.  So I ordered the correct size.<br /><br />I've worn three rings and within 24 hours, each one started to peel.  And this is just with normal activity around the house.  Can't imagine how they'd hold up with any physical activity."
1.0,I purchased this shirt 2 sizes bigger than what I usually wear because of the reviews of it fitting small. It was still TOO SMALL. I ordered an XL and it fit like an XXS. Cheap material. Not worth the trouble!
1.0,I am so disappointed! I will never purchase from this company again.
1.0,"The flip-up part broke after approximately a dozen flips. I'm all for super-cheap flimsy merchandise, but I expect to get more than five minutes' use out of things."
1.0,Broken in two places upon arrival.
1.0,Cheaply made. Returned for refund
1.0,Product Not at all what is advertised. It is NOT a coat just a thin unlined hoodie. Sleeves were too short for my medium. I Noticed item had a  Thread pull when I took it out of the shipping bag.
1.0,I ordered a large and it was extremely big and not only is the sizing off my shirt had several holes in it from not being stitched in certain spots
1.0,After the first time these were worn threads were sticking out all over the place. I will not buy them again.
1.0,The earring broke beFore I even tried them on!
1.0,Runs very small and see through
1.0,It would be nice to know ahead of time that the power bank id not included and it runs small. My husband wears a medium and i got him large and its to short on his arms and tight everywhere else.
1.0,Holes too small for craftts.
1.0,Smaller than expected and the butterflies small and cheap
1.0,"They are pretty as a bracelet, but they don't hold a hair band at all :(<br />Disappointed"
1.0,My watch broke after 3 months. Total waste of money.
1.0,"This dress...I cannot... lol... I purchased an XL and I'm a size 14. I took one look at it and didn't even try it on. Because it was so cheap, it wasn't worth the work to return it. I ended up giving it to my cousin and it fit her perfectly. She's about a US size 3, by the way, so...that should put it in perspective for you."
1.0,"Much smaller in person, light barely lit half of the screen. Returned mine instantly."
1.0,The blouse that arrived is not the blouse that is pictured
1.0,"It was cute and fit well, but the buttons are metal and JINGLE. I can’t have that. And it’s not just a subtle jingle. These are you’re-not-sneaking-up-on-anyone-sound-like-you-have-a-pound-of-change-in-your-pocket loud."
1.0,Gave these to my cousin a while back and he finally wore them this weekend to a pool party. He was in and out of that pool for 3 hours and they didn’t come apart in the least bit
1.0,Unraveled after only 3 months.
1.0,"The shape of the hook where it is connected to the feather part isn't shaped right. It sticks close to my piercing, but protrudes out and doesn't even touch my nostril, making it look odd. The feather is also too bulky. It would look much better being a little thinner."
1.0,This is not at all what it looked like. I returned it.
1.0,Very small! Did not even come close to fitting
1.0,"I purchased the watch bands about a 2 weeks ago, the latch does not keep them secure, my new watch has fallen off 3 times in the past week. I would not recommend them at all unless you just sit on the sofa and use the remote."
1.0,"I did not get the colors shown.  No pink. No pale yellow. No brown.  No orange Instead I got rust/ugly orange, camo, dark red, and various blues.  Scarves are crunchy and wrinkled after washing.  Don’t buy this item. Very deceiving.....and I never write comments and complain,  but this just made me really mad!"
1.0,Once again I ordered based on the awesome reviews and was deeply dissatisfied! This should cost no more than $10. It is made of a cheap material and should be advertised as a swimsuit cover up because that's what it is. I ordered 2 ( at the same time) and returned them the same day I received them. Horrible!
1.0,Less than 24 hours after putting it on this happened. All I did was load the dishwasher.
1.0,"Don't be tricked into thinking this is a functional compass...it's not. It's a piece of ""art""."
1.0,"Cute, but super small. Returned."
1.0,This watch arrived with a rose-gold finish that was not totally finished.<br /><br />It felt cheap and light. The watch finish was so ugly and incomplete that I immediately returned it.<br /><br />Don't buy this watch. It's crap.
1.0,size very deceptive
1.0,"Sizing totally off ordered a 5x, it looked more like an extra small.<br />Now STUCK WITH USELESS MATERIAL. Wont shop here again!"
1.0,I ordered a size a larger for my son still end up too small
1.0,"Nothing like the photo! You will be ripped off. As soon as I got the shirt, I returned it."
1.0,A $61 T-shirt. Seriously. I own several Simms Tshirts. None over $25. ???
1.0,"These ears look like they come from the 99 cent store.  I did spend less than $5/pair with shipping, but based on the reviews, I thought I was receiving a much nicer product.  They are tiny, you can see where the bow is glued to headband and the ears came wrinkled.  Nothing like the ears you'd buy at Disneyland - those are at least 2x larger and way better quality.  They also had no tag on them, so I assume they're not a legit product."
1.0,Didn't even get a chance to wear it to work once. Center piece broke on first morning.
1.0,Poor stitching. The fabric xxx was not even and straps twisted when sewn to cups. Poor quality all around.
1.0,The ring is beautiful but it's not what they said it was it is not 925 sliver it turned my finger green very disappointed
1.0,This sweatshirt was very poor quality and the company is not easy to work with as far as refunds go. I was never officially able to get my money back for this. The graphic looks like it was just ironed on and the color is different than advertised. It's almost like it's children's sizes.
1.0,It took weeks to receive because it came from China. The shirt was huge and the long sleeves were short.
1.0,Ordered a size large. These clearly were NOT a large.
1.0,Said for adults and children. No way these didn’t even fit my 8 year old. Returned. Not sure about noise cancelling since these only went to half on my sons ears and he’s small for his age.
1.0,"CHEAP and broke within a month, right after the time i could return it and get a refund. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,Pobre calidad
1.0,Waist elastic sewn in crookedly. Fabric is very thin.
1.0,"There was a rip in the item when it arrived (I’ll be asking for a refund). Also, “slightly see thru” is deceiving because my nips are noticeable. Third, the model wears the stretchy “sleeves” very well but when you put it on, it bunches together and doesn’t look nice at all. Lastly and most importantly, if you have big boobs like me, wear at your own caution or risk exposure. I can also imagine people who buy a slightly larger size having the same trouble with slippage."
1.0,"The shirt is super short, not even waist long, vita for very petite women"
1.0,I didn’t care for the two different types of material that this dress was made out of. I won’t wear it!
1.0,I was shocked at the poor quality of these tees.  They were no where near the quality of other TB t-shirts I have at the same $49.50 price.
1.0,thin & cheap--- with a liner???? skip this one in spite of the great price---
1.0,So disappointed. I bought the rainbow moonstone version as I am a YouTuber who does tarot on video and spend a lot on rings like this as ppl see my hands constantly on screen. My subscribers loved the rainbow moonstone one and would constantly ask me where I bought it in my comment section of my videos.<br />So I got this one today and look and there is a weird dark discoloration you can see in the picture near the stone and dents. As you can see in the picture. What is the discoloration? Is this really even silver? I couldn't rub it off. Then there are dents all on one side but in the 2nd picture you can see the other side is fine and is what the ring should look like. I'd return it and get a new one but I'm so busy right now it would be a huge pain in the butt to do. Either way I will not be recommending this to my subscribers. Maybe I will still return it for an exchange. I just don't have time right now and I may still end up with a damaged ring again.<br />I may improve this review if I get a new one but for now it's not a winner for me.
1.0,Put on the top and wore it the first day. Realized at the office I still had the tag on so I clipped it off only to notice a few seconds later -- the left sleeve seam was unraveling like before my eyes. At first I thought it was those thumbs holes and thought that's weird I don't remember seeing it on the description. So I checked the other sleeve and the wrist seam is Also unraveling. I bought this for our family pictures and even paid extra shipping to get it here sooner. Not happy. I'm going to try to return it. It probably would come completely undone after the first wash.
1.0,😭
1.0,This item is a vinyl sticker over a plastic band. Not noted in the product description. Not recommended. Returned same day it arrived.
1.0,Looks absolutely stupid! NOT AS PICTURED!!! Says Love my MAM instead of mom. Very disappointed!!
1.0,didnt fit my face
1.0,It was super long. I was bothered by myself not realizing the size when I ordered it.
1.0,"Very disappointed.  My son has average to wide feet/legs and the Velcro on the boot wouldn't tighten enough to keep the snow out.  Unless you have two pairs of socks and huge puffy pants, the Velcro is incomplete and will not allow you to cinch the boot in enough to keep their feet dry."
1.0,"I ordered two of these, they are both two totally different sizes. One of the shorts are like a medium, the other is like an xlarge. Definitely not happy with this purchase"
1.0,"Very cute, but cheap. Immediately broke when my daughter put in the sunglasses in her own."
1.0,I could not wear them they had a glare and i had to wear a smaller pair.
1.0,"Horrid fabric, is didnt even want to put it on my skin"
1.0,The top of this dress is really nice but the fabric at the bottom is really cheap
1.0,The socks are two totally different sizes.  One was four inches taller than the other
1.0,Stone fell out after a few months
1.0,HORRIBLE. do not buy if your a curvy girl. Which is weird because yumeko is curvy lmao. I ordered a 3xl and it didn't my fit my boob area. And I'm a dd38. The white top was torn when I received it. Not for curvy girls at all. More for flat chested.
1.0,Received the wrong dress!  The wrong dress was black -- that was the only similarity!  So bummed because I needed it ASAP for a special occasion.  Had to return it and wear something I already had.
1.0,See thru and not like the picture at all very plain and ugly
1.0,"Absolute junk and a total waste of money. Looks nothing like the photo and is child's sized. I ordered an extra large and can't even get it over my head. I'm a 42 inch bus bust,  which should fit according to their own measurements listed in the description of the shirt. The material is cheap, too, and again nothing like the photo. I've ordered other shirts from amazon and have been happy, so I guess I'm lucky that this is my first bad experience ... but save yourself the money and get another shirt. This one has no redeeming qualities."
1.0,"I got this expecting it to be like any other hoodie. It arrived 3 days late and it's a pathetic excuse for a hoodie. I pulled it out of the bag and thought it was a pair of leggings. Literally, the material is so thin and not durable, you can even see through it. To not buy this."
1.0,Very tight and stretchy not what I expected.
1.0,"Don't bother, they don't do anything. Unless you like getting shocked."
1.0,Color rubbed off after wearing 3 times
1.0,Me robaron los paquetes estoy furioso los pusieron a la entrada de la puerta y alguien los tomo......
1.0,The item was damaged inside bag when I recieved it
1.0,"Really big an awful cap, not as expected, extra big"
1.0,"Turning wrist black. I would like yo send back or replace, please"
1.0,Looks pretty but iPhone won’t fit in the pocket
1.0,I couldn’t open it.
1.0,I am always a size XL and this was way too small.
1.0,made with cheap fabric looks nothing like the picture and fits you like a night dress instead of something that you can wear out on the town
1.0,"Not what I expected, they are way too big, I plan on returning them."
1.0,This bra feels like it's made out of cardboard. I wanted to send it back but they want me to pay for shipping so I ended up having to keep it and to take a financial loss from it.
1.0,"Says for flat feet, but no less arched than any others I've tried.  These are hard and uncomfortable and were basically a waste of money."
1.0,"unbelievable that things being bought months prior, have either been lost in shipping or never made it onto the boat. was really hoping to surprise my granddaughter with this beauty"
1.0,Material very flimsy
1.0,They look so cheap !
1.0,"These have come apart randomly so many times. I finally lost the ear piece. Take them off they come apart, put them on the come apart. Modular glasses. Not a good feature."
1.0,These boots look good in the advertisement and first impression.  Not very comfortable. Had an issue with the shank coming loose a few weeks after purchase.  Not made to wear daily.
1.0,I personally didn’t like how it looked on me.
1.0,Wrong mask!!!!i want the butterfly led mask
1.0,IS THIS THIES USA  SIZE?
1.0,did not order nor receive such item
1.0,"This was a lovely Bracelet on Arrival. Within a Few Weeks, Charms Fell off Turned Copper color &  Metal Discoloration,Never Wet, I have on Several Alex Ani Bracelets,Understanding this  is not Alex Ani but Cost similiar, Purchased on Amazon, none have become discolored or lost charms, Very Dissapointed ,Cannot Wear,Return policy Not enough time when Problems can occur after a Month"
1.0,"Dress is awful, is is of a cheap and flimsy fabric, badly constructed, does not loo at all like the picture shown.  Can not wear anywhere!  Will be returning item for refund"
1.0,Not quality fabric. Feels like a potatoe sack.
1.0,It’s too bad the graphic on the tshirt was printed crooked and off center. Other than it seems fine.
1.0,buckle broke in less than two weeks
1.0,"I loved the photo and read the description carefully.  I knew they would be small, but did not expect them to be that small.  They are too tiny for adult and even for my ten year old niece.  They look like they are made for babies.  Also, I thought the stones were supposed to be yellow, but I can't see any hint of yellow in them.  Maybe the stones are just too small to see any colors."
1.0,Not pleased
1.0,Fell apart immediately. The binding came off after first wear.  Don’t purchase.
1.0,Not worth the money. They are to short and cheap. They came 6 inches above my ankles.
1.0,"The description says the hips are 62.5"".  Wrong.  These pants are about a size 8 or 10 at most.  If you are buying this one-size pants because they are supposed to be roomy.  You will be disappointed."
1.0,The picture looks like the bottom is fully covered but it is almost a thong
1.0,All the black paint came off the first day. Looks stupid now. Useless. It will catch on all fabrics too
1.0,The glasses arrived bent and flimsy. They weren't the high quality I was hoping for. Very disappointed.
1.0,Really Bad quality
1.0,"Absolutely worthless! I wear a size XL generally and, because of how small Asian sizes can be I ordered a 5XL (I mean, they're supposed to be super baggy, right?) and I can't even pull them over my hips. They're a size small. The 5XL is like a size SMALL. My 10yo daughter is wearing them and they fit her like they do in the product picture. Plus they're not even close to the same colour.<br />DO NOT waste your money."
1.0,WAY too small. And I even went by the sizing chart.
1.0,"ordered a size small, which according to the size chart would be my regular semi-fitted size. the dress was still too big and completely shapeless, even with the ""belt"". looks nothing like on the model"
1.0,Size too small for what o ordered. And the shape is not as in picture
1.0,"Wore this 3x but forgot about taking a picture but the bottom has 2 holes at the seam on the butt. It's as if the material frayed at the seam.  It fit perfectly so it's not from being overly stretched, it's from thin material being pulled by the stitching."
1.0,"Absolutely horrible! One of the cufflink was so dirty on both sides. I had to scrub it FOR A WHILE with a toothbrush, soap and jewelry cleaner. It was a yellow substance (appear to be an egg) on one side and some dirt on the inside. Whatever it was, it was there for a while as it took me some time to wash it off. The overall shape-it looks like they were stored somewhere in the garage (the metal is dull with spots) additionally rolled in some dirt and egg, just disgusting. Not only it seems like cufflinks were used once but they were dirty. Birthday present order American Flag-what a shame."
1.0,"I am only giving it one star because of the size chart is not correct. I have very small hips and the x small was too small and not able to change size only get 60 percent of next order, not expectable.  I will give them this, the product is of good value and looks just like the picture."
1.0,I ordered a size bigger than I normally take and it was still too small
1.0,Size is ridiculous.  I normally wear 2X but ordered 3X and it was a joke. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,one of the earrings came without the part that you put in the ear. I wish I never got it.
1.0,"Cheaply made, arrived broken... Returning."
1.0,HORRIBLE MATERIAL!!!! Feels like a raincoat. Will be returning
1.0,"First of all, this fabric is SO thin and practically see through, there is nothing to it.  Second, the length is ridiculous.  I'm 5'5 and could easily cut 12"" off of the bottom of the dress and it would still hit the floor!  I would not buy this again."
1.0,clasp broke within a week
1.0,Not like picture posted. Weird fit.
1.0,"Not worth the money, and not the item I thought I was buying"
1.0,BROKE AFTER A SHORT TIME USING IT.
1.0,"This suit is not cut correctly. I am a small/medium and ordered a large because I read it runs small. The top was still way too tight around my ribs (I’m a 34-A bra) and the rash guard (the only thing I really wanted in the set) fit my arms but was extremely wide and cut wrong around the neck. It was a gamble for how cheap the suit is, some might be cut better than others. Not worth the purchase."
1.0,Product is suppose to be 6 inch for all who have small wrists. After a very long wait in receiving item Holy Heavens its was a lie. Not a 6 inch bracelet at all. Hangs down to the middle of your hand or way up your forearm.  Truly don't believe what you read and don't purchase this item.
1.0,"I am allergic to most metals, except sterling silver and surgical steel. Anything else irritates my skin super bad.<br />The description says these are sterling silver, but they started turning my nose green and irritating it within a few days.."
1.0,These are see through. I think that is all I have to say.
1.0,Llegó roto envié una foto
1.0,Well I tried it and it didn't work. My head kept getting stuck to my pillow with the damn Velcro strap. And it felt like I was suffocating. Seems like a good idea.
1.0,Way too small for size listed.Have correct size please.
1.0,This broke the first time I wore it. It was cheap and looked and felt cheap.  guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,These fit odd. The waist was way to big and the bottom around the ankles too big. It didn’t hug either part and would fall down if I worked out in them. Returning
1.0,Nothing as pictured
1.0,This dress is at least 2 sizes to big and very boxy. It doesnt not fit properly.
1.0,The size was not accurate at all….way too small!
1.0,I had to return it. It looks like it was made for little kids. I wanted to love it. Also sizing was off. I ordered it for baptism and was really bummed.
1.0,Loved the colors but as soon I used the firSt one the color immediately started peeling off and I found myself spitting pieces of plastic out. Really sucked !
1.0,Cheap looking!!!
1.0,"I was expecting leather shoes at this price, but it is not.. just a printed one."
1.0,My husband did not like them and he couldn't even het a refund
1.0,Plastic junk
1.0,Two pairs arrived with giant holes in them.
1.0,My son loved these- he wore them for only a week and the straps broke. Poor quality
1.0,Ive had this ring for 4 days and it already broke! Disappointing.
1.0,"These sunglasses are hideous. The abnormally big size, the color...everything about them is hideous. They didn't look so bad on the product page, but once I saw them in person...UGH! Save your money!"
1.0,they just do not feel like real coal haan
1.0,Made for Asians not Americans.
1.0,"Way too small, will be returning them."
1.0,I wore this to the beach twice and the second time it literally broke & I threw it away. Bad buy.
1.0,Thought these were cotton so that I could use them as a mask. They are some nylon material. Darn.
1.0,Very unhappy since this bracelet will not stay clipped and won't stay on your wrist would like a refund or another bracelet
1.0,These pants were super short. They hit about an inch and a half above my ankle and I’m only 5’4”. The material is kind of stiff and doesn’t seem durable. I won’t wear these due to the length.
1.0,"Way too small, my usual size. It was too small for my daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than I am."
1.0,Runs very small like jr size
1.0,"Horrible ,nada que ver con la foto ,tela mala."
1.0,Big snag. Contacted seller regarding the pants and they said to contact Amazon to return.
1.0,Beautiful colors but item was delivered broken. Only 3 colors are even useable.
1.0,It is not smooth Chiffon as describes
1.0,"The waist band set very low on hips ,an the basket  isn’t very big so really doesn’t hold much junk !<br />Would never buy again"
1.0,Does not match quality. And then the seller had the audacity to tell me to pay for return shipping.
1.0,Awful quality and did not save packing for return. My fault.
1.0,Within two weeks the shoestring clips fell off  you get what you pay for
1.0,"Tiny, broken when arrived"
1.0,Worked fine twice but the third time it fills with air from the tire.  Useless how can I get it replaced?
1.0,"I had to return the hydra-cell flashlight, as it is terrible. but had to keep the cells - don't know why you'd want them, as you definitely don't want the flashlight!"
1.0,"I am very short 4'10 to be exact. This fits awful. I intended to wear it to work with a sweater and heels or flats, might as well wear it as a night gown. Too long, too large and the material is like pajamas. I passed the return date so now I am unsure what to do with it!"
1.0,They fit great and feel great awesome flip flop except its been two months and the rubber bottom has separated from the foam which is why I am giving them a 1 star review. I have always gotten their fanning model and have never had issues I wanted leather because the fanning tend to stink after awhile. I wear flip flops year round and if the durability was better I would say these would be a 5 star flip flop but to fall apart after only two months is ridiculous. Based on price I might give another try but more than likely I will just be ordering olukai.
1.0,"Awful fabric, hangs really poorly. Had friends of varying body types try this on....ick!"
1.0,Don’t fit your legs like tights more like boot cut
1.0,what do you have to do is order one 3 times bigger and pray maybe they actually send you something besides a 3x
1.0,"The item was pretty large but it looks exactly like it does in the picture, so, oh well, I wouldn't get it again."
1.0,Very cheap. Had to throw away 3. Tried to change battery and just cheap.
1.0,"Terrible. They look good on the website but as other have said, too big frames, and awkward looking on face."
1.0,3 had holes in them and they are already falling apart after 2 washes.
1.0,Leotard was too small and like all the other reviews the jewels were trash
1.0,My regular size is 7 but reviews said they ran small. What an understatement on these running small. Very dissappointed
1.0,Pobre
1.0,I bought 2 of these in April and was very please with them.  But now only 3 months later 1 is frayed to the point of all but separating.  I am now in the market for another pair of straps or replacing the frayed one again.
1.0,"Not high waisted. Also,at nearly 2 inches above my daughter's ankle (at 5'8""). Quickly returned."
1.0,I wanted this size but it ended up being very long and bulky which did not work for me.
1.0,This outfit could have used double the feathers! you can see right through to what was glued on it it definitely does not look like the picture!
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture.  Really thick n does not fit well.  Needs to b a thin material to make it look good. Looked like big blobs.  Sry
1.0,If I could give a zero I would I wrote in the comment box what color to write it the wrote it over what the mask said and refused a refund. Poor customer service.
1.0,Worst sweater ever horrible company.
1.0,The hats were nothing like the picture.  They were black and white.  There is nothing black in the Alabama uniforms.  They were supposed to be crimson and white as shown in the picture. My return code expired and I am now stuck with 2 ugly unwanted hats.
1.0,La tela no es elastica
1.0,does not fit like the picture
1.0,The arms and chest were way to small for the size they were supposed to be.  My husband is a XL and I had to send that size back for the XXL and the XXL was still to small.  The XXL fit like a L should fit.
1.0,"These are just like pantyhose type material they run, it only lasted about 3 weeks and they ran like pantyhose. For the price it is not worth it at all."
1.0,"This was so bad.  Doesn’t fit the way the picture makes it look like it’ll fit.  Neck is high.  Just a generally weird shape.  I know it’s supposed to be a comfy, oversized fit, but this is like something my uncles would’ve worn for Thanksgiving in 1993.  I don’t want to look like my uncles.  For reference, I’m 5’5, 120 lbs. and ordered a small.  Returning."
1.0,Didnt fit round my neck and to short
1.0,"Product was cute at first glance.  Nice fabric and color.  However, the surging done on it was very poor quality and parts were hanging off of the dress.  The back is supposed to have a button with an eye loop closure however there was not even a button sewed on."
1.0,The material was cheap.... the picture is just a sticker....and the sizing is way off. Would not recommend.
1.0,I am an XL and I had to give this to my friend who wears a small!!!!
1.0,"I accidentally double ordered these rings, first of all and I wanted one set for my daughter. And, the ring is tight on my finger and too small for my daughter so, now I'm stuck with 4 worthless rings!"
1.0,It is very short and see through.
1.0,"Returned this product, was on the small side and my boyfriend could not wear them at all."
1.0,"They feel cheap, and the coating had almost entirely peeled off within about eight weeks. You get what you pay for!"
1.0,The large was child size
1.0,I ordered a large hoping to cover some areas having twins. It was ver snug and the neck was tight as well. I returned it.
1.0,These would not hold on to my son's glasses at all
1.0,This is very poorly made. It had holes in the pockets when I received it.
1.0,"I purchased a Large 12-14 even though I'm typically a medium 8-10. The sleeves are very short and the shirt is sewn of our quality.  The end of the sleeves are frumpy and awkward, plus the brown patches aren't placed at the elbow. I'm really disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,Runs very small.  Cheap material
1.0,"I purchased these for my teenage granddaughters. They like to shower and then lounge in their PJ's. I didn't like anything about them. The material was clingy, fit like a glove, and were totally inappropriate to be worn in mixed company. overall not worth even half the price I paid for them. So I returned them, shopped locally, and purchased six pairs of capri pajama sets for about $20.00 more than I paid for the two pairs I received and then returned."
1.0,"Was excited to get this lock and extension to use with my bike. However today it arrived and the extension bar was missing from the package, meaning I received just the combo lock. It is basically useless without both parts. I don’t need just a combo lock. The first thing I did was check the box to see if it fell out. It wasn’t there. The other issue is, I don’t want to be penalized for returning it so, basically it is a loss. And I would not recommend this item. I cannot recommend something I did not receive."
1.0,Sent me the wrong color. Looks nothing like the picture the material wasn’t even the same total garbage!
1.0,It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever encountered.
1.0,"Not the greatest material and a little too short. I'm 5'9"", not a prude, and I felt is was just a little to close to my hiny."
1.0,Very small. I'm a XL and the dress is like a medium size. I'm 😞 disappointed.
1.0,"I have a hard time believing this is original Skagen, that band has broken and looks<br />excessively worn out in about a month of use"
1.0,"Color is dark navy (expecting soft washed blue color) the fabric is soft & stretchy, but the pockets vertical stripes & boxy fit make it a very unflattering shirt.  Overall disappointed due to the look."
1.0,"Reading these reviews....you can tell after you buy something... which reviews are obviously fake. Yes, your glasses fog up with this mask. They don't run small BUT. the nose piece is far to low. If you try and wear it so the nose clip is in the right place, it blocks your vision. Very poor design. I will be returning this product."
1.0,Bad fitting
1.0,Returned….it was not true to size.
1.0,The spelling of Mizzou was spelled wrong. It was spelled MIIZZOU. Spelled with two I. Didn’t see it it till I opened up the package. Ridiculous.
1.0,"These are supposed to be knee length compression socks, which is most definitely NOT the case. They are ankle socks at best."
1.0,Would work with my particular nose
1.0,Sizing is wrong.
1.0,"The style would be nice if the fabric wasn’t so cheap<br />But it’s ALSO SEE THROUGH<br />I bought the white, idk about the other colors<br />The fabric is low quality<br />You get what you get I guess<br />Not a dress I recommend for looking nice"
1.0,Silver my butt. This turned my finger green after one day
1.0,The first time i wore this i noticed at the end of the day that the M had broken off.
1.0,The top was great but the jeans were too wide and look nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Dress came dirty with , ink spots all down the entire belt. Gross."
1.0,"Once adjusting it would not fit a normal male's wrist. I had to move the clasp so far down it wouldn't actually buckle. Doesn't look bad, but complete waste of money."
1.0,Cheaply made and looks that way when worn with your nice expensive outfit.
1.0,"CHEAP MATERIAL,  TORE RIGHT AWAY"
1.0,"The concept is cute, but the quality of the hoodie was not. The quality looked and felt cheap. The quality honestly could’ve been mistaken for a hoodie from aliexpress for $5 or something. The sizing was also smaller even though I bought a large. The large fit like a medium."
1.0,Shirt was small than a normal medium shirt. Need to get the next size up if ordering this item
1.0,The socks are so tight I can’t get them on. I went according to the size chart on the website.<br />So they will be donated to Goodwill.<br />I’m very disappointed
1.0,"Definitely not worth the money (item is overpriced).  So small it would be difficult to fit any average size child or young adult.<br />It was shipped in a very small bag that could not be savaged for return.  Therefore, you are forced to pay for packaging and<br />shipping (mail) to return it.  Don't! Don't! Don't buy this item."
1.0,I put it on upon arrival and broke it!<br />Wouldn’t suggest buying this!
1.0,It rips and tears very easily poorly made
1.0,"When you look at the product description, you may see a lot of color and design option. But,  I have received almost identical color and pattern. It’s not unisex friendly, and as a 50-year old male, it wasn’t useful."
1.0,Look elsewhere!!! Sheesh!
1.0,"I've never worn it because I couldntell.it would fall off of me. I keep.meaning to find out if I can return it, but by now they may say it's been too long."
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE: I can’t believe no where did I see the shirt say it comes with a RANDOM DOGS name already ON THE SHIRT..,.. OSCAR…really why does NO one say it, I DONT have a dog named OSCAR …. But after sending back 3 items this week I’m just going to wear it as a pajama shirt instead of WHAT I actually got it for… this is the dumbest thing ever"
1.0,Piece of junk. The necklace is worse than a free necklace I got at a celebration of life. It barely will clasp. You can’t make the emblem lay flat. I will never wear.
1.0,Weird face mask—plastic side already pulled off.  Stamps had large metal connectors and plastic on head grip pulled hair.  Avoid.  Any terrible product from overseas with poor instructions.
1.0,"My daughter has very small feet, I ordered 1 size up and I received the wrong size (2 sizes bigger), but the shoe itself was still small. Her tiny narrow feet can barely fit through. Maybe it was just the pair I received,  BUT Definitely wouldn't be ordering these sandals again."
1.0,"I recieved my top, that was supposed to be a 3X, it's more like a small. My daughter can wear it and she's a small. Then it looks NOTHING like the picture, it doesn't drop off the shoulder at all, it's a regular round neck t shirt, with a Semitric lines at the bottom. Its thin and flimsy, which would have been tolerable had it at least looked like the picture!! And be the size it's supposed to actually be!- THIS WAS SUCH A RIP OFF!!! I'm going to reach out to customer service and complain, I feel violated and Robbed!!!-buyer BEWARE!!! I dont know why Amazon allows people to sell things that are not what is actually advertised?!"
1.0,"I saw some reviews saying about the band holes not matching the watch, but I give a try. It is impossible to pass the pin through the holes. I saw that some people cut the band to make it work, but I didn’t want to try. I returned the product. I don’t know if It works for other watches, but definitely it doesn’t work for AX-1040"
1.0,supposed to be a 3X....no way.....way to small......
1.0,Handle ripped easily
1.0,This item fit is very small.  I ordered a size up and it was still very small.  When I tried to send this item back my local<br />post office said they do not have the address printed on the return lavel in their system.  The item looks just like the<br />picture but it runs very small.  Waiting on a response for the return request.
1.0,"This product had no zipper or buttons to slip into the top of it.  In addition, it wasn’t stretchy material so that you could slip it over your hips and shoulders.  Poorly designed."
1.0,"Exactly what they advertised, except the opposite. Uncomfortable, and not durable at all."
1.0,Nothing like what I expected and did not fit at all. Couldn’t wear it.  If I could give it a zero I would
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like what I expected. The tie is huge and bulky and they didn’t want to return it so I took a $5.00 credit and gave it away. Very disappointing.
1.0,Foolishness!
1.0,"**I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />Not really sure who they used to measure a 3x, but they were not human. I wear a 2x at Walmart, 1 at torrid, 3x at forever 21, and so i figured i would play it safe and ordered this shirt in a 3x hoping it would be flowy and cute. The shirt barely goes past my stomach, the sleeves are so tight when I wear it I can't lift my arms over my head, and if I do manage to get them up the shirt turns into a half shirt. As for the fabric, it feels very cheap. Very thick and not soft or flowy at all. Only good thing about this shirt is the weave/knitted top part. That is very cute and almost saves the shirt. Almost."
1.0,CHEAP LOOKING! Cheap material! Not worth the buy! Gave it away! The picture is like fake news! Don’t buy
1.0,"I read lots of the reviews and looked at the pictures of this dress posted online, there were more good reviews and pictures than bad so I risked it and bought it, major bummer. paper thin, see through dress, much smaller even though I had based my sizing after other reviews,  then expected,  also wrong color. I ordered the grey and got some sort of washed out light blue, with a tinge of grey, then you can't even return it cause the seller never gets back to you. Just know if you buy this dress you may be wasting your money as it's a toss up whether you get a good quality one with the liner underneath or the cheap thin see through wrong size, wrong color, wrong everything one."
1.0,"Plastic, hard, uncomfortable and priced. My kids uses to play stars wars 🤦‍♀️"
1.0,I paid for expedited shipping so they arrived very fast but they are made of some thin spandex material save your money go to Walmart and buy some fabric to make your own because these won't stop anything!
1.0,Cheap quality. Disclaimer: Be careful applying any force to “stretch” over your boot . As this will indefinitely tear the product absolutely in two pieces . And therefore hinder any further use .
1.0,"You don’t know if it’s front or back, no tags"
1.0,My first one came damaged. They replaced it fairly quickly but the new one lasted just about 2 months. Guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Did not fit my watch! Very upset
1.0,I had return my dress i ordered 2xl and i gat one look like S size
1.0,Run small not really good quality fabric
1.0,I ordered the smallest size and it was way to big on me. I was bummed
1.0,"This is a blouse made for tiny women.  The size chart is inaccurate.  According to the chart, the shirt I ordered should have been too big.  Instead, I couldn’t pull it on.  Beautiful style if sizes were accurate."
1.0,Looks like I’m wearing my grandma’s bathrobe.  Very disappointed.  Won’t be wearing this.
1.0,Sizing misleading
1.0,It's not what I expected it's not anything like what was advertised but what I thought I was getting very disappointed I am returning it
1.0,This is a very poor clasp on these earrings. One would not stay closed at all. Do not buy?
1.0,Didn't like the pant isn't long enough.
1.0,"i got the sunglasses because it said it was fit for small faces and once i got it in the mail, i was totally shocked. the shape was weird, color was very purple, and most importantly, they were enourmus on me. so big"
1.0,"This size isn't even close. These are supposedly &#34;xxl&#34; but they fit smaller than the &#34;xl&#34; I have from 2 different companies. Look elsewhere, as these are not worth the purchase."
1.0,"I prefer a bikini brief for comfort and support. These bikini briefs look good. However they very quickly lose their appeal as they slide down my butt. I have a 35"" waist and am not overweight. The medium size is the right fit, but they simply don't stay up making the wearing very uncomfortable. I do not recommend."
1.0,"I had to return these shoes. They smelled terrible, like gasoline!"
1.0,No glitter on the face mask at All
1.0,the clasp broke the first time i tried to wear it.
1.0,Lining of the dress is thin and see through
1.0,Sizing is not correct
1.0,It was way too small and I even bought 2 different sizes
1.0,"I wanted to love this shirt because I mean, it's a cold shoulder galaxy top. However, GREATLY disappointed. It was cheaply made and the shoulder holes were uneven. Not great quality at all. Not to mention smaller than described."
1.0,They will not hold your d's up trust me don't buy
1.0,One of them broke a couple days after I used it
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL. I’m not a small person but I’m typically a large and the large felt like it should fit my size zero sister. I couldn’t get one button
1.0,I don't like how it looks and I think it is not effective
1.0,Way too big and it was a very cheap material. Ordered a small and got what looked like an xl
1.0,This product runs really small...i ordered an XXL and it runs like a Small
1.0,still waiting for missing wrist strap.
1.0,"Felt comfortable at first; however; shrank so much that these boxer briefs became ""tighty whities"". I felt like I purchased bikinis. They shrink and are not durable. Would not buy again."
1.0,Cheap material and way too small.
1.0,"Super thin see through material. Ragged hem, neckline is below bra line, very poor quality shirt. Might as well not wear a shirt at all."
1.0,"The fabric is very cheap, I was hoping more thick and some cotton. It feels like a then shear uncomfortable shirt."
1.0,"Only thing worth while is the packaging. Each ring is individually wrapped then placed in a bag.<br /><br />The quality of the rings are TERRIBLE. Just bits of cheap plastic coated in cheap paint. Missing stones if there are even any stones at all. Very poor quality. I would NOT recommend purchasing these. Very cheap, very obviously fake. Rings are super tiny, can barely get one onto my nose to try one, getting off is a pain."
1.0,"Just to let you know that they are not pajamas so they don’t have the front opening, like pajamas. Otherwise great!!"
1.0,"Do NOT buy if you’re looking for animal themed! I got them for my daughters birthday party that’s “wild” themed and if I didn’t return them, 7 would have been used out of the 24 for the party. NOT WORTH IT. The description says animal and hearts….NOT accurate!!"
1.0,Round neck not crew neck.  Way too big a neck for working out.  I'm a medium and this requires my to wear a crew neck under it kinda defeating the purpose
1.0,huge and flimsy very poor quality
1.0,"The lenses are way too large and unfortunately, this seller will not allow returns. I will never wear them and I'm VERY disappointed!"
1.0,"returning; too large, cheaply made."
1.0,Not true to size at all!!!!!<br />Not sturdy material!
1.0,Meant for very very small ears. Did not fit me 5 or 11 year olds ear. Wouldn't recommend this.
1.0,The pants are definitely for wider kids and not my skinny boy. But I returned because the pants claim to be new but were covered in long white (dog?) hair.<br />Absolutely not what I paid for and probably would've dealt with it had it not been for the flaky skin hairball on the inside as well. No thank you
1.0,This jacket feels like plastic too much money for the quality
1.0,"I should have waited to complete a review because what I thought was a quality coops fit product is definitely not. After only 2 times wearing the socks, the upper calf area shredded when pulling them up. These are definitely far from the copper fit socks I’ve had for 5 years with no sign of wearing. Definitely fake takeoffs poorly made."
1.0,HORRIBLE!! WOULDN'T FIT A 10YR.OLD & COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!! BUYER BEWARE!
1.0,Worst item I ever obtained from Amazon.  Only lasted a couple hours; replaced & replacements only lasted one hour.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0,Second watch doesn’t work. Please refund my money
1.0,I didn’t get to use the product it was smashed up when I received it. Too bad so sad help!
1.0,Cut too square
1.0,"Turned yellow, washed them turned even more yellow.."
1.0,These were very disappointing. The crotch is much too long and overall sizing is off. I’m usually a medium and these fit like a large and more than high waisted. I’m 145 lbs and 5’10 so there’s no excuse for this sizing fail. The fabric is also thin and not compressing at all. The pattern is like red camouflage- not as pictured.  I returned these for a full refund.
1.0,Unfortunately this shirt is very poor quality. It ripped after being worn only once as you can see in the picture.
1.0,"The material is cheap cheap cheap. Feels like straight acrylic. Not soft. Yes stretchy. Feels synthetic, but looks like natural fibers. I hate them. I'm picky. Sorry."
1.0,"This is a nightgown (not a button one) that was supposed to contain cotton!!! and it says to wash in cold, hang dry or dry clean.  Total bunk, It is Not as described, so buyer beware!  Returning this, right away.  Why on earth can't they make a 40 poly/60 cotton or more cotton nightgown anymore, please?  I live in a warm climate and don't want to sweat while I sleep.  Leave off the spandex, some of us have allergies.  I really dislike this game of not describing the product accurately."
1.0,Worst quality the back is totally off center with placement
1.0,Terrible and ripped out of the package!
1.0,Hat is OK. The shield is really floppy and not what I expected.
1.0,It will break within a week. Flimsy wallet.
1.0,It's unshapely and unflattering.  Looks nothing at all like the picture.
1.0,Way too small. I ordered a large and the size tag says 2XL.
1.0,"The metal grommets that hold the rope handles in place broke the second time I used the bag and the handles fell out of the hole.  I had several bottles of sunscreen, a beach towel in it and a set of keys and that was it."
1.0,Tarnished and changed colors after a few weeks. Got this for my mom as a gift and am very disappointed in the quality.
1.0,In the picture the shirt looks velvety soft. It is actually shiny and too much polyester. Not comfortable at all. No stretch. I returned it.
1.0,To cheap looking and broke 2 times the first day
1.0,This has got to be among the top cheapest feeling things I’ve ever tried on. It felt like a potato sack or something. Very rough feeling fabric.
1.0,I bought this Xmas gift item and it was delivered with a stain on the collar not noticed till the package was completely opened and tried on the day after Xmas. Embarrassing. Thinking of returning it.
1.0,Super thin and see through
1.0,I bought these based on the other reviews stating they didn’t run too small. I wear a size 8.5 and these hurt my toes. I won’t be able to wear them for work.
1.0,"They came babdly packed in comparison to other I have purchased with other companies.<br />Only 5 in the pack, and honestly they look as if were regular quartz, kinda pale yellow but unfortunately not citrine at all."
1.0,The necklace looks like the picture and is very formal.  It arrived with one of the yellow stones broken off.
1.0,Also need camo under shirt
1.0,how the heck would you connect that with your sunglasses.....stuff like that makes me crazy...dont tell me its German engineering and then forget a connect piece....
1.0,Uncomfortable don’t like it
1.0,"I was very disappointed when. I received this piece. It did not fit at all. I will probably never be able to wear it, just a waste of my money. ...."
1.0,Broken upon arrival...will be requesting a new one be sent.
1.0,"I was so excited to get my hands on these adorable gummy bear earrings. I paid just over a dollar for them, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that they're broken."
1.0,"Missing pieces.  Unwearable, don't buy.  You get what you pay for, but in this case I paid little and got far less.  It's trash.  Don't buy it."
1.0,"I love Betsey Johnson designs, and this one is so cute. However, The strap is just a touch too short and the purse is really bulky."
1.0,i was very disappointed in this jacket. I bought for my daughters birthday too late to return. sticking is coming out. strings are loose.
1.0,Oh. It's just another &#34;as seen on TV&#34; product. Nevermind.
1.0,They are so light you cannot see the markings! Do not waste your money on this!
1.0,Broke the first day I got it
1.0,Much smaller than marketed
1.0,Order an Xl and if fit a preteen! Cost more to send back than I paid for it.
1.0,Looks almost plastic.
1.0,Cute dress but It’s see through ! 😏
1.0,Looks cheap!!!!
1.0,Turned green first time wearing
1.0,"I never ever leave a review but I had to for this one. The description says “chocolate brown”, the shirt arrived yesterday 3 weeks after I ordered, it could literally fit a toddler (I ordered a medium) and it’s red…looks absolutely nothing like the picture. Terrible quality. I’m baffled by this because multiple females on tik tok tag this brand and show this exact shirt so I don’t know what happened with mine. But my tag does not say Almere like everyone else’s does. It’s from China. Beware when ordering"
1.0,Kinda short.  Seems like for petite???
1.0,CHEAP MATERIAL!! YOU WONT LIKE IT !! IS CHEAP AND UNLESS YOU HAVE  &#34; A&#34; SIZE CUP THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
1.0,I bought these for a Holiday gift and that was a big mistake. They're made of poor quality. Feel like plastic. Super cheap. No way I can present them as a give to my Niece. They  are going straight back to Amazon.
1.0,They slip off my glasses too easily. I don't trust them because of this.
1.0,"I know, what do I expect to get for such inexpensive earrings? But really, these were a mess. The yarns were all askew, glued horribly, and threads/yarn sticking up all over the place. The metal was really cheap looking and had scratches on it, and they were quite simply unwearable. I did what I could to try to apply some jewelry adhesive to the yarns to tame them in place but it just ended up looking worse. Plus, these were REALLY big! I live big statement jewelry, but these just screamed dollar store to me."
1.0,Threw it in the trash. Poor quality.
1.0,I have a smaller wrist and the strap is still not long enough
1.0,They’re huge on my nose and I have a big nose.
1.0,The material is stiff.  No stretch at all.  Feels like a burlap sack.
1.0,Too short to tie a good knot
1.0,The straps are so flimsy that the first day I put it on and went to take it for both straps popped right off when trying to adjust the tightness.
1.0,"I ordered these for my daughter to wear at gymnastics. They are awful. They are maybe an inch and a half wide, they stretch out to go over your hand and never go back to the correct shape. (she is 8, her hands are small) I would not recommend these to anyone. Spend a little more money and get Under Armour ones that will actually work for what you need and last more than one use."
1.0,"It is too small, and we are trying to find out how to return it. Since it came from China, we are still looking into this."
1.0,"Got this for my boyfriend at Christmas. He never even got to use it. The moment this wallet was opened and one card was added, the spine snapped. It’s not like we’re beasts and slam cards into a wallet. The card was added to one pocket and the wallet fell apart. Garbage. I was very disheartened."
1.0,I have been buying and returning this shirt 3 times<br />I wear a xl. Be very careful
1.0,It came dirty
1.0,Runs small. Very cheap looking
1.0,I wore this for maybe 1 week and the flower popped off....
1.0,"THIS IS TOTALLY CRAP..FAKE STERLING SILVER,TURNED COLORS AFTER A FEW MONTHS..."
1.0,Didn’t like it. Heavy
1.0,These were extremely way to small they fit like a small so therefore I can't even wear them!!
1.0,Purchased for my Husband. After 2 weeks the front rubber sole already flaps.( Unglued) toe area looks like stretched leather with puckering. Not enough shoe padding. Stuck a new set of Dr Scholls and it still didn't help with comfort. Feels like walking barefoot. Can feel every rock and lump you step on. We do not recommend!!
1.0,It was just a weird cut and didn’t hang well on me. I usually buy Jones New York women’s blazers with good luck and thought this would be similar. I loved the color. Fabric just looked cheap.
1.0,I ordered my normal size and it was way too small. I probably needed 2 sizes big around the cup was right size
1.0,"Fabric does not look like how it’s advertised, Weird fitting in the legs and very short."
1.0,the temples cracked one adjustment
1.0,The metal eyelets wore out both pair of shoelaces within 3 months.
1.0,The dress smells so bad. It’s gross just to begin with.  The material is stiff and very heavy. it’s def not a spring or summer dress.  It’s not what I was expecting!!!! Worst of all they won’t refund me and I had to pay shipping. I’m embarrassed to bring it to goodwill
1.0,"I really tried to like these socks. I read that they mostly fit true to size and I did not find that to be true at all. I wear a size 7 women's shoe and the socks I got were way too big and slipped off my feet easily. I felt strange about returning socks, but I should have. They are way too big."
1.0,Fell apart in less than a week.
1.0,I love the pattern but this shirt absolutely no flexibility. The material is hard with low thread counts. If you have ANY girth to your arm you will NEVER fit in this shirt. I ordered an XL but the sleeves fit my 11 year old son. So disappointed.
1.0,The pants are too small. The pants look like kid pants.
1.0,Horrible... will not purchase this product again.
1.0,These turned green in 2 days of wear! Very cute but basically a 1 time use.
1.0,Worse quality ever. Bad tailoring.
1.0,The small one was too small and the larger one was too big. Otherwise it's really cute. I usually wear a small top and medium bottoms for reference.
1.0,Material is not what I expected. It was to much like polyester.
1.0,Couldn’t get the dress over my arms. So disappointed. I’m 5 5 140 pounds and got the 8.
1.0,The inside of the belt broke
1.0,I ordered the set of 100 starfish and needed all 100. The set only came with 90! 😡so I am having to scramble at the last minute to find replacement items for the last 10 for teacher gifts .
1.0,I returned this dress. The top material is thin you can see my bra bad through it. Its a different material then the bottom. The bottom half is pretty and soft.  Also where the two materials connect it too high. It was tucked under my boobs. Pulling the dress down didn’t look good.
1.0,The material was very flimsy and the garment had no shape. The v cut was was to open on the cut and revealing. Just a cheap shirt. And no boob support.
1.0,The package only included the jacket. It should have been the entire set!!
1.0,"Update:<br />These started flaking and one of the sides pulled out WHILE I WAS WALKING! I wear size 8 and ordered size 8, true to size.  These sandals fit like a glove. They are very comfortable and look pretty. The bottom is textured to prevent slipping and the feet cushion is soft and feels like a cloud! There is textured pattern that doesn’t bother the bottom of my feet but it provides a good grip so my feet doesn’t slide forward. The platform is great size for every day comfortable wear. They add some height without adding discomfort to my ankles. I am so glad I got these cuties!"
1.0,"Awkward fit. And inconsistent size seams. Example, the bust and abdomen fits fine but then the sleeves are too small in that they cut into the under arm and little room for arms themselves. Same can be said for pants. Displeased."
1.0,Cheap material. Don’t buy!!
1.0,I’m 5’5” and roughly 150lbs and I got this skirt in a medium which is what I usually wear. The skirt fit but it was not comfortable and the back of the skirt did NOT cover my butt. The shorts In it just felt scratchy and too small.
1.0,Poor quality fabric and color.
1.0,I thought this was a sweater. This is a scarf with sleeves that you need to somehow wrap around your body to make the image pictured above. I’ve watched a YouTube video to figure it out and no luck. Waste of money.
1.0,"I got a good four months of use out of this and was fairly happy with my LightWalker... but then it ceased to work.  Wrestling with the batteries made it work temporarily, but after a while it simply failed to work at all no matter how often I changed it.  There isn't any contact or company information on the box or documentation, so clearly this is a throw-away item.  I would have been okay if this were something out of a discount store or if t had lasted a good two years, but this wasn't necessarily a cheap item, and I feel I've been cheated out of a proper functioning product."
1.0,These socks are not good for skiing. They are regular knee high socks without cushioning.
1.0,Poor quality fabric. Looks nothing like the picture. Save your money and the frustration.
1.0,So far I have only worn one of the two and regret to say the piece that holds the magnet on came loose right away scratching my arm in the process! Guess it's true we get what we pay for! Disappointing!!!
1.0,Horrible!!!! BAD TERRIBLE QUALITY & IT LITERALLY BROKE BEFORE I COULD EVEN USE IT!!! I STRETCHED OUT THE CORD TO SEE HOW FAR IT WENT AND I DID NOT PULL HARD AND IT SNAPPED!!!!!!! LIKE HOW?!? S0OOO DISAPPOINTED BAAD BAD BAD DO NOOOTTR BUY IT!!!!
1.0,Came apart after less than 2 months of wear
1.0,Seams ripped the first time I wore it and the zipper was very difficult to move.
1.0,Wasn't too fond of the quality of the swimsuit.  Ended up returning.
1.0,Product would have been fine but the chain broke that goes around finger within 10 mins of having on.  I was disappointed and was not even able to wear.
1.0,"Received as a Christmas present.  Robe doesn't close once it gets passed your knees.  Very thin material,  light weight. I have one that I got from Walmart several years ago that is better quality all around and it was cheaper than this one. I would not recommend it! 😐"
1.0,The distance portion at top distorts image.
1.0,"buckle would not hold belt,returned belt"
1.0,It’s super cute but the top was way too big.  I tried giving it to my friend who have a F bust and it was still too big for her.  I tried washing it so I could return it but the top fell apart in the wash.  Very disappointing
1.0,"I bought a size bigger than what I needed based on their size chart. The fit is almost like kids. The sweatshirt is baggy, not somewhat fitted like in the picture. Also, the sleeves are extremely short. I contacted the seller and they said they measured in different centimeters?!?! I tried to return this purchase, but it will be over $80 to ship back to ASIA. Not worth it... DO NOT BUY"
1.0,The ring was a gift for someone and I can’t give it away. It’s not even gold! It looks like it’s been used. It’s a faded gold with tarnishing on it.
1.0,broke extremely easy. I actually had gotten to for Christmas and one was perfect but a month later the globe part fell off and the other one that I had the globe part was deformed and wasn't even a circle.
1.0,"I wore these for about a week and noticed they started to tarnished. I didn’t wear them in the shower and took care of them. I’m disappointed that happened because it says it’s sterling silver, and it’s already lost some of its color. I don’t know if I received a bad pair or what."
1.0,I was looking for an everyday tote bag for the office.  If your looking for a low quality high priced cheep bucket buy this.
1.0,"Did not fit, size 14 looked like a size 6 tiny"
1.0,Got a small and it turned up hanging off me like a xl
1.0,Material is not comfortable- I would return but too much hassle
1.0,Where do I return these are too big?  Why no address on the package?
1.0,Wore this shoe once and side stitching has started to unravel. Terrible
1.0,"Very nice and comfortable on my 10yr old. I ordered a size smaller (I think the ages 6/7?), Bc reviews said they run big, and they definitely do.<br /><br />UPDATE: we had a very warm winter last year,  so my son wore these just a few times. Last week,  he wore them for an hour or so to play outside,  and there are 2 large tears on one of them!  I bought these a year ago,  but my son wore these just a handful of times."
1.0,Very cheap and hollow
1.0,"The quality of this product is poor, all around too expensive.not what i expected"
1.0,Didn't even receive half the sizes. Total disappointment. Gave one star because because I had to.  Cheap and unlabeled. And having the worst time trying to get in contact with someone to return or even discuss the issue. Guess that's what I get for trying to save. Haha. Seems like no one is happy with this product.
1.0,The product didn’t work for me. I have sprayed my booths countless times and walked around in them for couple minutes and I didnt feel a difference in it. Maybe there’s something I’m missing or doing wrong ?
1.0,Pom Pom on hat fell off the 1st time i wore it. !
1.0,"I was really excited to get this product despite the mixed reviews. I’ve always had good luck with buying clothes from Amazon, on the lesser end of value. However, blah just blah. The color isn’t even the same as the photo! Not at all the rustic orange I was expecting, more like orange meets salmon color? It was just terrible.<br />I tried on the garment, I ordered a medium, because I saw reviews saying that it was too short. I’m 5’4 and about 130 lbs. the length in the medium was good, it hit just about the mid thigh. I like my dresses short so it worked for me. However, the rest of it felt loose and baggy, and despite it feeling too big I still had the weird gap issue in the chest area. And I don’t even have a large chest! The material of the dress doesn’t look cheap, but the thin-ness of it makes it feel cheap, along with the ugly color.<br />Overall, just no. I will be returning it.<br />Buy at your own risk."
1.0,"This dress looked nothing like the picture, the material was like a shower curtain, it was way too big (even after consulting the size chart), and it did not hang ""nice."""
1.0,Broke after landed in the Philippines in my first trip.. Bad one…
1.0,"product not the same as in the picture, sleeves are about a foot shorter very baggy around neck"
1.0,This sweatshirt looked like it was made for a lounge lizard. Absolutely horrible fabric.  It had a shine to it and I would be embarrassed to have my grandmother be seem in it let alone me. Threw it directly in the trash.
1.0,"For the price I paid, I would have expected a wire for the nose bridge and at least all the straps sewn securely. When the product arrived, the upper strap on the left hand was detached when I opened the pack. Cheap and carelessly sewn. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1.0,I wore the coat one time and the zipper broke. Got a replacement and on the 3rd west it broke again. Very cheap zipper but the coat itself is wonderful. Suggest taking it to the dry cleaners for a new zipper asap
1.0,These earrings are totally fake. Don’t waste your time and money. Had to return.
1.0,"this is way too small xtra small like for a child. very disbelieving had to give it to a child .  I tried to return it and got no one on line. I tried to return to a drop box could not get a receipt ,. felt like burning it . saw a child and said here merry Christmas. wear it and hope you are blessed. at least I gave it to someone who would enjoy it."
1.0,Has no elasticity.... would not buy again
1.0,Ordered this for my wife...women's medium.  Came in NO WHERE close.  The medium is like a child 14 or smaller.
1.0,Earrings claim to be hypoallergenic. I can’t wear any of them for more than an hour before my ears turn red and start to itch and swell. I don’t recommend if you any type of sensitivity to jewelry.
1.0,"Only one pair arrived out of two, large, in package! Shows online as two pair, but only one pair in package!"
1.0,The softness is great but the fit is  bad. Makes the heals slide off. Had 3 other people try them & it was the same thing. Unwearable.
1.0,"I'm not sure this is real malachite.  Looks plastic, some of the beads look hand painted...  I feel I wasted my money."
1.0,I ordered a XXL and it was more like a medium.
1.0,Cute but made small. Size  up
1.0,"absolutely horrible, not anything like the picture,  heavy fabric, no shape HORRIBLE"
1.0,"I wouldn't buy this again, extremely stiff and uncomfortable unfortunately."
1.0,Fabric super thin buttons were flimsy zipper wouldn’t stay up. It was a cute fit. Wouldn’t buy it again.
1.0,"Cheap, discolored in a week"
1.0,Was very short
1.0,Broke within 2 days of wearing
1.0,Cheap cheap fabric.  Pattern looks like it was printed on.
1.0,Dislike. Rusted
1.0,Poor construction. Hook came off while putting it on the first time. Does not stay on wrist as pictured.
1.0,very low quality
1.0,Picture very small
1.0,"Super cheap feeling material and the button seems flimsy like it could fall off at any moment. Plus it’s literally see through. What pattern underwear am I wearing? if you guessed polka dots, you’re right! I got a medium and it was too small, so size up if you still want these for some reason. I will be returning them, they are absolutely not worth the 20 dollars 👍"
1.0,This is by far the WORST bra I have ever tried. Thank God for returns!
1.0,I was disappointed because the leather necklace part smells like mildew :(
1.0,This dress was larger then my husbands 3x shirts and I ordered a large based on the size chart. I returned due to this
1.0,I didn’t expect the color to be a bright neon pink. It was so bright I think it would blind me in daylight. I was hoping it was a more muted pink…<br />Returned.
1.0,Lenses feel as though they are magnified. I think I will get a headache if I wear them for any extended period of time. Size of glasses is nice. Not worth keeping over the lens issue. I would shop elsewhere.
1.0,Worked ok until the main piece broke. Only lasted 2 months running only 5 hours a day. You get what you pay for.
1.0,This was very cheaply made. Not even 2 weeks of wear and two of the three stones have fallen out.
1.0,not bad but i don't recommend
1.0,"These pants are for a stick baby, they have a tiny waist and are really long. And then the shirt is tiny."
1.0,The breakaway part of the lanyard will not stay together.  If I so much as gentle tug on it it comes apart.  I thought these were meant for heavy tug protection not a breath of wind?
1.0,3 of the 5 bands would not click in place and just fell off … Returned.
1.0,Cheap fabric. Was already ripped and fraying when I opened the bag. Returned immediately!
1.0,"it turned green very shortly after receiving them, and it was really hard to open when in your nose"
1.0,"The fabric is really cheap. It is not soft, very itchy. It has a bad smell. There are no directions on how to wash.  Definitely going to return this product. Very disappointed because it is cute, but I can't deal with the cheap, gross, smelly, itchy fabric that it is made of."
1.0,Don't waste your money!  The Lens are not even close to a fit and will shift our of place or completely fall out with a moderate touch or movement.<br /><br />They are great lens color looking from behind the lens but ultimately not worth the hassle
1.0,fell apart first time
1.0,"I have a small to average size head (7 1/8), but these things are terribly tight and uncomfortable.  Others have complained about quality, and that is right.  Not only are they made cheaply, it appears that the arms just go straight back from the frame--rather than curving to fit the head.<br /><br />They are also ugly.  I generally like a boxy/square look, but these just look like a big rectangle on your face.  In fact, they look like those disposable movie theater 3-D glasses..."
1.0,I was really hoping these would be a better fit for my son. The material is perfect and breathable but they are extremely small and I can barely get it over his head. I wish these would have fit better.
1.0,The fabric is so cheap and poorly made. I immediately returned it.
1.0,Don't buy their clothes! The  pictures are nothing like what you will receive.
1.0,Dont buy
1.0,Very small compared to picture
1.0,"Piece of junk. Only used once or twice, and now it won’t even turn on even though it’s fully charged."
1.0,I did not like it. The quality is very poor.
1.0,Polyester is horrible. Says it is cotton.
1.0,The material was thin and basically see through. Very low quality!
1.0,the ugliest skirt ever and it fit very funny and i reach out to the seller and he never got back to me
1.0,Product was labeled XL. Would not fit a large size person. Very undersized.
1.0,What a complete disappointment. I wore these glasses only one time. I was going about my evening and heard the arm of the glasses cracking and eventually broke as I was wearing them. They weren't tight on my face the fit was very comfortable they're clearly just poorly made. I definitely need my money back for this item.
1.0,"I loved this ring when I first received it, despite how incredibly thin it is. I’ve owned it for over a year now, worn daily with my engagement ring, and it is clearly NOT 14k white gold. It may have been plated with something, but after a year it has all but worn off. The base metal is a dingy yellowish color, nothing resembling white gold or silver. There is also no stamp of authenticity verifying the gold it supposedly used."
1.0,"More like a kids or women watch, very light weight. The light is very dim, it's tells time. Throw away watch when the battery died."
1.0,"We took off the plastic tab so the batteries would work and it did! But when we wanted to turn it off, it would not turn off! No matter how hard we pushed the rubber button! So disappointed!! 🙁🙁🙁"
1.0,"I normally wear an XL LOOSE FIT. These fit as a small and very thin. Very disappointed since I ordered them April,21 and received May 5. Sending back"
1.0,"The front and back panels of this dress are all polyester, no merino. Only the stretchy side panels are merino. I do not understand the point of this design, very disappointed."
1.0,Came from China.  Ordered ladies med. got girls large.  Not at all what I expected.  I should have read more about it.
1.0,Terrible quality!!! Would not recommend!
1.0,Did not fit our Dell 11 Chromebook
1.0,"Unfortunately one of the inside packages was open upon my opening the intact shipping envelope, and only 2 of the 3 Fitbit bands were in the package. The purple band was missing. Now I have the aggravation of having to return the items."
1.0,It looked like it was made for a butt in the front and back! Loved the fabric feel which made it hard to send back but they really were not flattering.
1.0,Touch screen capability doesn’t work. And my hands were numb today after my walk in 37 degrees weather. Going to return tomorrow. Keeping my hands warm is most important. They failed.
1.0,"They were beautiful and very soft, but the first time I wore a pair, three holes appeared in the seam of the toe. This was with normal wear- nothing at all strenuous. I noticed the same issue in the reviews before buying, but I figured with 5 stars, I'd give them a chance. I'm returning them because the craftsmanship doesn't even match up to the socks I can get at the dollar store."
1.0,They arrived damaged
1.0,Bought 2 of these and they both got holes in the grouch.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter for christmas. My daughter absolutely hates this item and will not wear it. basically it is a plastic crystal you would find on your grandma's lamp or chandelier glued onto a leather wrap. ugly and cheap. don't waste your money. i found another H20 necklace which was actually worth the price and she loves it.
1.0,The inside of the swimsuit has a white lining that is when you wearing the swimsuit you can see the white lining in every seam of the bathing suit. That seam moves often so the white inside is very obvious.
1.0,The manufacturer's description inaccurately states that this suit can be worn to &#34;fly to the moon&#34;. One trip out of the landing capsule was all I needed to judge this space jumpsuit unfit for space travel. I had to stay in the lander capsule for the whole trip; this suit ruined my whole vacation! What a waste of 50 ISK . . .
1.0,"Wasn't waterproof, comfy though"
1.0,"quality is unacceptable, bezel froze up first time in ocean, watch quit working 6 months later"
1.0,"The size chart from Homeyee is way off,so the dress is way too big. Disappointed.."
1.0,They came folded up in a box big enough for sunglasses. I didn’t realize they were gonna be so flimsy. I got a 6 should have got a 7 I think. And they are very slippery. I almost busted my ass at Applebees lol
1.0,"Poor quality...One screwdriver blade is chipped, others are not ground straight."
1.0,"I literally wore it for possibly a week when it started to fray. It will be in the garbage soon.  I work customer service so I sit on my but and type all day. I was doing construction work, working out, snagging it on clothes or anything."
1.0,"The hat wasn't the right fit. I returned it December 2, 2019 and I still haven't received my refund. Please send refund to original payment. Thank you."
1.0,"Don’t buy this!! Horrible stitching, makes you seem like you have shoulder pads on. Also you can see threw it."
1.0,"Hot, itchy, and  heavy was not able to put and take out phone easily"
1.0,Less than two weeks of use and the heel area is so compressed that it is uncomfortable walking.  There is an obvious depression in the heel area of the interior.  They are also both small and narrow for the listed 8-9 size.  Discarded packing so can't be returned.  Good Will?
1.0,Not water repellent<br />Went snowboarding and got wet easily
1.0,"I was unpleasantly surprised to find that of several pairs of compression socks/compression sleeves we'd bought speculatively, these were not returnable, seemingly arbitrarily. Very disappointed."
1.0,As soon as I put it on the ends frayed apart. You can hear the material fraying apart as you put it on. DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1b94d660773142bc3839a663c23fb248]] The left foot is clearly sewn on backwards
1.0,After one week the watch fell apart. I was looking forward to a wewood watch for two years. My wife got it for me as an anniversary gift. Promptly returned it after one week due to the links of the band falling apart. During the week of having it I constantly had to tighten all attached screws.
1.0,Instructions to match up the ring size was way too big and they do not let you return the product and exchange for a smaller size.
1.0,Broke it in a little over a week
1.0,The zipper was split when I opened the plastic bag. I didn’t even get to try it on. Very disappointed. Cheap cheap cheap!!!!!!! I understand it was very Inexpensive but I couldn’t even try it on. Very frustrating.
1.0,"Cheaply made, one sword came broken"
1.0,So very tiny and cheap looking. Maybe good for a small child
1.0,"Terrible. Not the size it says. I ordered 4x, this thing wouldn’t fit on my 10 year old nephew. Won’t give me my money back either unless I create a shipping label which costs about as much as the damn shirt did. 0/10 terrible seller, I got robbed."
1.0,"What I got in the mail, was the most disappointing product I’ve ever purchased off Amazon.<br /><br />First off: the leggings were shipped in the clear plastic bag that normally comes inside another box. Deal-breaker? No, but certainly off-putting.<br />Immediately they reminded me of those cheap department store leggings from 2015 that you only wore under a skirt because they showed everything with stretch. The only compression I found was in the abdomen- the leg and hip fabric was thin and unflattering. So it makes sense that when I tried the squat test, these leggings failed miserably! Even just holding the fabric up, you could see strange, unattractive ripples in the material.<br />I don’t know if what I received was a major, yet one-off quality mistake, but this has been my second major issue trying this brand out. Suffice it to say I’m returning these and going back to my trusty Colorfulkoala leggings."
1.0,Not what I expected. The material on this apron is a plastic type of material.
1.0,Horrible. 2 strips of plastic and a felt shoe. Unusable
1.0,"I opened the package to find it had obviously been sold prior. The chain was in a knot in two places, unclasped and the circles are almost paper thin. I would add the photo now but amazon's system was glitching."
1.0,Don't buy it. They fell apart the first time I tried them on. They went into the trash
1.0,Got these for my boyfriend and we were both disappointed. They were way to thin definitely not for wavers. More for style but won’t benefit the waves.
1.0,Just got it looks nice but was late
1.0,zipper pocket on 2XL green is a fake pocket
1.0,"The pants did not look at all like what was pictured. They should have been tight at the ankles and fit, well like they looked in pic.  They were baggy and bunched at the ankle. I’m 5-6 and a 30” inseam should not have been that long. I’ve bought this brand before and they fit well, but they were a different style (dress yoga pants with a flair bottom)."
1.0,Super synthetic cheap sweaty
1.0,"They are super cute, but I wore for two days and they turned green. These are deffenitly not surgical steel. I would Not purchase these."
1.0,"Ended up cutting these up to make handkerchiefs. Beautiful fabric. Asinine sizing. Not true to size, actually about 5 sizes small. Why must they lie about sizes? All this does is create very unhappy shoppers. Please don’t lie to us."
1.0,"Very bad item its called racer back, it should be called razor back!!! I wore it once it kept itching, finally I took it off and I was bleeding the material is so course & sharp.(not safe) other than that it fits great ?"
1.0,"These gloves tear way too easily. I've had ones that ripped while being put on, and the gloves are a little big on me so I'm not putting much (if any) stress on the plastic. I've used gloves of the same thickness that do not tear so easily, this is simply a poor quality product."
1.0,Way to small for the average human face.
1.0,"The "" gold "" color is too yellow to be anything remotely resembling<br />actual gold. The wires are flimsy and will easily break off. When I tried to return, the information would not show in my Amazon Orders as it should. Where did it go?"
1.0,they are very short and not as shown in photos and the colors are ugly and not like the photos either.
1.0,I do not like that it looks like quality and when it reached I'm so DISAPPOINTED ❗ the threading around top is treading looks very very cheap material. I'm so mad that I threw the packaging away 😡 I dont want this shirt. The pictures really fooled me . I dont like your product at all .
1.0,Would give it zero stars if I could. Broke within minutes.
1.0,Didn’t return because needed something to give as a gift.
1.0,"This &#34;winter jacket&#34; is a glorified windbreaker which doesn't even do that effectively. I'm a native New Englander who doesn't mind the cold but a winter jacket is still a must for Boston living and this doesn't remotely qualify.  Fortunately it arrived on a fairly mild day but the wind still goes right through this.  Looks like I'll be continuing to shop for an actual winter coat before the next serious cold snap.  Thanks for adding an extra, completely useless and extraneous step to that process, Hard Land.<br /><br />If you live someplace where the winters are mild then this might suffice as a &#34;winter coat&#34; but if you live someplace where it actually gets below freezing on a regular basis, save your money and buy a real coat.<br /><br />*Edited*<br />I’ve attached a screenshot of their actual response to this review. Suffice to say I will be returning the coat but I wanted to be sure to post this so that future potential buyers can be sufficiently skeptical of their other 4 and 5 Star reviews."
1.0,"The sweater looks nice, BUT has been shedding since arrival. I tried to wash it twice in a lingerie bag, with no luck. I cannot even move it without black shedding covering the floor…."
1.0,"Had to send back. Love the soft fabric, but clothes run small. Also, there are pieces of elastic on the breast portion that rub against the nipple (exactly what I didn't want). I'm keeping the camisole since I already wore it, but cutting out elastic. It doesn't fit the bust either, but is comfy for sleep."
1.0,Not true to size had to return .
1.0,I RETURNED this RANK  STANK AZZ SUIT!!!  THIS Set was so funky!!!!!! idk how tf  it fit I didn’t try it on!!!! It smelled so bad through the bag  it made me nauseous !
1.0,"Demasiado pequeño. No funciona , ademas no es igual a lo anuciado"
1.0,"I was so excited to see the vast array of inexpensive rings offered by this vendor, I had to stop myself and decided to order just one for starters. Glad I did!!  I understand that sometimes low prices reflect the type of quality you could be receiving.  But this ring was so cheap looking and the fake stone looked horrible. I threw it in a drawer and haven't seen it since. Not worth the hassle to send back. Maybe some rainy day, I can paint the stone with nail polish and give it new life."
1.0,"Colors don’t match at all, it’s a bright blue and not at all navy. It’s also ridiculously large."
1.0,"If I could I would not give this a rating, very poorly made and way too small, I bought large and it fits like extra small and mind you I wear medium."
1.0,"Way, way too small.  Sizes are inaccurate"
1.0,"Just some sticky cutouts stuck onto this stocking  to make it personalized. The stocking itself is cute, but cutout letters are just that and look like that too."
1.0,"Did not fit well at all and was super heavy. Made you look strange, not like picture at all"
1.0,Super cheap and took forever to ship
1.0,The heart is very small and a darker shade of red than the top part. The heart shape is also not especially distinguished.
1.0,"It was suppose to be for my grandson’s wedding.I sent my measurements in to the designer.The dress was 2 inches to small in the waist 4 inches to long and 2 inches to small in the breast.I totally waisted a $100.00 for nothing, because it was none returnable."
1.0,Was disappointed. ...there r no rhinestones on 1 side of the belt....waste of $
1.0,I'm sorry but this band just didn't work good quality but I almost lost it because it wouldn't stay latched and for that I can't give it more stars I don't even use it.
1.0,"Junk, broke while I was trying to get it on my arm."
1.0,The worst. Got a different pair of glasses from shown in the picture
1.0,Broke after one wash.
1.0,"Bought this for making smoothies while I travel because it is very light, compact and easy to clean. I only blend basic ingredients like protein powder, spinach and berries. No ice. And it barely even worked for that. I ended up with pretty chunky pieces of spinach in my smoothies. Made it work for about 5 days and then had to recharge and now it will not stay on to blend. Starts up for a couple seconds and then dies. Have tried recharging multiple times and no luck. Waste of time - find a better product from a reliable company that guarantees their products!"
1.0,The anti fog is crappie and cheap
1.0,I didn’t like the fact that the lining was 19 sizes smaller than the twin and the gown was see through so with that being said the lining was too small and my butt would’ve been on display had I worn the gown so I returned it
1.0,"It’s no where close to the picture, I’ll be donating it to the local thrift store"
1.0,It was very cute when I first got it. After a couple wears it began to unwind. I noticed it also made me so lazy and really sleepy. I haven’t had to energy to do anything while wearing. Even at work I didn’t wanna work I just wanted to sleep. Don’t get me wrong it is very cute but horrible energy and cheap string.
1.0,Ordered one size and it didn't contain both push-up pads... Ordered a second size and both push-up pads were missing... returned them both
1.0,Product will not attach to the watch. One side does but the other side is backwards and will not click into place as the piece was made to attach on the wrong side of the band.
1.0,Too shiny and cheap looking. Spend the extra few bucks on something that is better quality
1.0,The fabric wasn't nice quality.  The size is more like a large rather than a XL.
1.0,Broke when I put it on
1.0,"This dress was too small across the chest, and when we submitted a return, we were instructed that we had to pay for return shipping back to CHINA!  This would cost more than the dress itself!  Buyer Beware!"
1.0,These are nothing like the picture. They dont fit right at all and are practally see-through. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I wish they were free returns so I could send them back.
1.0,I returned these. They were cute but very very wide. Not for regular or narrow feet.
1.0,The flowers all fell out of the metal holders and can not put back in. Lasted 1 week. Dont recommend this item
1.0,I ordered this for myself in XL. I wear an XL in tops. I was happy to receive it for a cooler weather top. Can you imagine my dismay when I opened the package and tried to put it on.......WAAAAAY too small!!!! I couldn't even get it over one arm and head!!! It was marked XL! I gave it to a friend who wears a womens size XS. It fits her just fine!!! Dissapointing!!!
1.0,"Runs small, definitely not oversized. The rainbow is a thick iron on."
1.0,"This shirt is made from terrible material, I wash it one time and it looks like I’ve had it for years. It’s got snags in the shirt. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1.0,After one wash the print melted to itself. Ruined.
1.0,Smelly and cheap!
1.0,"I ordered a large and this dress didn't fit. I'm a size 8 and I would have maybe needed an XL. This seems to be more of a youth dress. It was also very thin. More like a beach cover up, not a dress. Gave it to my niece instead of returning . Pretty disappointed 😞"
1.0,Doesn't hold its shape by the end of the day you look like you're wearing diapers.
1.0,"Very disappointed with these... the photi makes them look flesh colored which is what I wanted, needed, and thought I ordered. The description and tag on them even says ""white "" however they are GREEN! As in like Hulk Green. If you want green hands then these may be perfect for you but they are NOT what's pictured. Be aware there is another seller on here selling the same with the same photo and they are Green also."
1.0,HORRIBLE
1.0,Very pale pink instead
1.0,"This is not a good buy. The image is like a hard layer just sitting on the sweatshirt. The fabric is horrible, it got all pilly after the first wash and cannot be put in the dryer-it will shrink."
1.0,Very cute but I only received one earing..
1.0,I found them a full size too small and extremely uncomfortable.  Straps were stiff and the memory foam was nonexistent.  Cute styling though.
1.0,My sons shirt was ruined after the second washing. The moose stuck together and won't come apart. I am disappointed.
1.0,RUSTING!!! After only a few weeks of ware
1.0,Shocking.  The Ganesha pendant is nothing like the picture. It is so tiny that you cannot even make out anything. It is microscopic.
1.0,"The jogging pants are too short, wide-fitting from the knees to my ankles."
1.0,Was too scratches .
1.0,"Would like to return, but past deadline. Snap has popped off and the jacket has not been worn yet."
1.0,"Devolví el producto porque era muy pequeño, me realizaron el reembolso y a continuación me lo volvieron a cobrar. Amazon cada vez funciona peor."
1.0,"I wanted to like this, but it’s small in all the wrong places, and baggy in all the wrong places."
1.0,the metal details in the fastener broke during the first use.<br />cheap.
1.0,Bad fabric feel. Doesn't fit well. Very disappointed and immediately returned. Didn't even show my partner.
1.0,"This key chain is not anything of the quality you would expect.  The key chain itself is heavy and seems to be well made, but it broke after about 3 weeks of normal usage.  I would not recommend."
1.0,This skirt fit well but the print was not what was expected
1.0,Is the material on these stretchy?
1.0,Don't waste your money. The top is cute but the skirt is an unwearable joke. It came with only one button right in the middle and no button holes on the straps. What in the world?!?!
1.0,"I was in love with the idea of this bag! I read the reviews and most of them are great so it seemed like a good choice for what I needed, a light weight bag to carry a few meds in. Unfortunately, as you can see, the bag has just completely fallen apart. The front pouch has come completely unraveled from the bag and everything falls through. The coating on the inside of the bag is coming off in multiple places, it's just a bummer because this bag would have been wonderful if it was able to sustain actually being used!"
1.0,I returned this product.  The glasses and flags were both poor quality.
1.0,Returned to sender👎🏾 Not sure what I was expecting but this definitely wasn’t it!
1.0,I ordered two and one of them after the first wash started to fall apart.
1.0,"Waaaaaaaay too big... sent them back. Maybe I ordered too big. Nice pants, though."
1.0,This is a wast of money the dresse was just too bid and the now well stick
1.0,"Fabric is tough not easy to wear , not flexible, sizing is off. Too small."
1.0,"Junk!! dont waste your money, the grooves in the bracelet are not deep enough to hold ANY type of hair band."
1.0,I have to return this because the color is very dark purple. I do not like it.
1.0,Received item broken. Gave as a gift. Too fine of an item. Did not get full refund.
1.0,The stone was broken off when I received it.
1.0,The dress is made wrong. The lace doesn’t have a way to cross it over to tie the dress right.
1.0,"Looks darling, but it's beyond tiny. I'm 5'0 and 34B and there's no way I could get it on..."
1.0,"I was not impressed with this dress, odd fit."
1.0,"Thin flimsy material, I can't even wear it, total waste of money."
1.0,Just got this and tried it on and it’s a stretchy nylon-ish material and doesn’t look like the better quality dress shown in the picture. Won’t be keeping this as it will not work for the event I purchased it for. It is stretchy and could be nice but the material is just cheap.
1.0,"Loved the fit of these pants and the style, except how the pockets poke out and look a bit strange. They can also be annoying when trying to get your phone in and out. Despite this I WOULD HAVE still given them a 4 star review. Unfortunately this weekend I noticed that all 3 pockets right, left and rear have torn at the seams and have small holes. It appears that the holes develop around where the faux leather parts are. Something about the stitching at the corners of the pockets with the faux leather is not holding up. Everything else is flawless. I'm really disappointed because I was just about to order multiple additional pairs of their shorts because these are so comfortable and I also love a pair of pants from this company which are amazing. Disappointing after an initial stellar experience. They've been worn but no where near enough that this should be happening. It is clearly a manufacturing flaw"
1.0,I was really excited to wear these however when they arrived they were way too small no breathing room in the front and I’m only 140 lbs. they shouldn’t be a one size. They’re okay if your petite though and they are really warm
1.0,"I found these when I searched ""purple velour leggings"" and they're certainly purple, but NOT velour nor velvet as it says in the title/description. They're some kind slick, shiny stuff, about as far from velour or velvet as possible.<br /><br />They're also too dang short! I'm only 5'5"" but have very long legs; when I held these up with the crotch at the proper level, these fall about 7 inches above my ankles! Even with those weird extension bits!<br /><br />So, definitely returning these."
1.0,I can’t possibly wear this nor keep it because it smells like dead fish. There are other reviews that say this as well. I am returning this for a new one and if the second one smells as well then I will look elsewhere. I will update my review when I know more.<br /><br />Update:<br />Second one came and smells just as bad as the first one. Returning!
1.0,Not want I was looking for.
1.0,Baby girl is 2 months old and these are WAY too long! They dangle so bad!
1.0,"Ordered  a xxx.  It was barely a medium. I gave it away to a small, skinny guy."
1.0,This shirt runs too small. i got xl my daughter wears a small and it fits her!
1.0,Watch batteries didn’t last a whole month!
1.0,Product was torn when arrived
1.0,The hat was so small !! I got two outfits for my son and daughter. And the boots were ridiculously big.  The material is super cheaply made. It’s a mess.  Gonna have to return
1.0,Complete garbage couldn't believe when I received this shirt wasn't at all as pictured.
1.0,"Looks cheaply made. I understand it was $8, but I didn’t expect it would look like a gum ball machine necklace."
1.0,"Terrible bathinsuit. I ordered a 16 only to find the straps were WAY too big and offered absolutely zero support. Any amount of water in the cups and the top would fall down. The cups were shaped too narrow and not broad enough for the size. The cups were definitely designed for women with no breasts and definitely not plus sized. I ordered a size down to see if the straps were any shorter but they weren't and the cups were the SAME SIZE on the smaller size. It's clear that the cups and underwire are the same size for all sizes??? I ended up having to wear my smaller size because I was out of time and had to wear it to my sons mommy and me baby swim class.....I definitely won't be weAring it a second time. Over all waste of money, no support, odd shapes cups and narrow cup width, definitely not sized for a plus size bosom. Would have returned both if I didn't wear the second."
1.0,Only 1 out of the 3 masks had the nose band on the top side. The other 2 would of had to have been worn upside down to use the nose band properly. Super disappointed since my son was really looking forward to the Mario characters.
1.0,"Awful quality, flimsy and poorly designed/sewn. Absolutely no resemblance to the product being marketed in the photos/description. Complete scam."
1.0,Don't buy this watch fad collar
1.0,ordered XL and fits like a med. returning
1.0,Didnt like it
1.0,I liked the style of this belt it was the perfect color. How ever the smell is so bad we thought we had mold growing in our house. Even my coach purse smelled After the belt had been in it. I can't wear with it smelling that bad.
1.0,"I bought this watch as a gift for my sister. It arrived fine and was working but my sister told me today upon my asking about the watch that it stopped a week after i gave it to her. Had she told me before i would have been able to return it. Now it has been over 4months.<br /><br />Also, at the time i bought it in September it only had one review. Just saw the other reviews of watch being stopped the next day. What is worst is the fact that there is no warranty card with the watch to get it checked at a fossil store.<br /><br />Very very disappointed."
1.0,Junk junk junk
1.0,Too big couldn’t fit my wrist had to send it back
1.0,This product came broken.
1.0,Size did not match the measurements..
1.0,Cheap! The gems popped off. Made my ear infected
1.0,"I couldn't see myself wearing this out. Ever. It's just cheaply made and looks it. But for the price, it would be fine for a costume party or maybe a very, very dark club where no one could scrutinize the quality. It doesn't button or zip up either, just has the belt to close it. Overall, not for me so I returned it."
1.0,It was too large and very stiff.
1.0,"as soon as I put them on I knew they wouldnt make it through the day.  horrible fit, not comfortable, could not recommend less."
1.0,"Very strange fit - I returned it.  It wasn't comfortable at all on land, I can't imagine the awkward feeling in water."
1.0,I did not like the stiffness of the skirt.
1.0,"Had to return, didn’t lay right around neck over graduation gown"
1.0,"I was thrilled when I received the bracelet. It looked nice; although I doubt very much that the beads are genuine amethyst....2 of the beads look like bullseyes and another is almost solid white - and you don't see that in the natural stone. Then, while I was putting my arm through a loose sleeve, the charm broke off without even catching on anything. The charm was what made the bracelet special to me."
1.0,"THIS IS NOT A 30X LOUPE!  Rather it is 10X, as other reviews have asserted.  If you are looking for a 10X loop, this is okay, rough edges, mediocre quality, but you get what you pay for.  I returned mine for full credit."
1.0,Fit as expected but the material did not provide enough control over problem areas. Material was not breathable. Garment was hot.
1.0,El vestido es muy feo y de mala calidad
1.0,First let me say this is not a DRESS!!! It is a oversized shirt that stops right below your stomach! It does not have all the lettering as a REAL Moschino shirt this shirt is spelled “MOSCHNO” The shirt seems to be of a mix between Nylon and Spandex. Total disappointment:(
1.0,The title says it all. Sorry guys.
1.0,"This is a really poorly made watch.  I'm not really sure what I was expecting at this price point, but it really is a terribly cheap, unwearable watch."
1.0,Don't like that they are oversize.Want to send them back but no return address
1.0,No especifica qué es
1.0,son muy pequeños
1.0,Absurdly cheap. There is no difference in the front or back and I am someone who wears a small/medium and I ordered a large and it still doesn't fit like on the model.<br /><br />It was so inexpensive I didn't waste my time returning it but I've never worn it.
1.0,"I ordered the teal with the black dots and lace pattern at the bottom and received the Blue 2 color instead but I like it so I'm going to keep it.  I will reorder the teal and hope it gets here in time for the event I wanted it for.<br /><br />I love the fit of this cardigan. I'm 5'6"" and about 197lb and the 2XL fits me just the way I like a light weight cardigan to fit.<br /><br />The sleeves are nice and long and can be pushed up and the fabric has some weight to it so it hangs well and is slimming on an hourglass figure.  I could probably go one size down but it wouldn't close quite as well in the front as it does now.<br /><br />Edited to add that I reordered the teal cardigan and was sent the Blue2 one AGAIN. Now I have two of the cardigan I did not order.<br /><br />I'm very displeased and I cannot recommend this seller to others if they can't get the orders right. I'm sorry to leave a bad review but I've now spent $50 and will have to go through the hassle of returning the duplicate cardigan and I never got the one I wanted."
1.0,They are smaller than it said. The rings will not fit. They are cheaply made. Don't waste your money.
1.0,The first time I go to put it in and the stone fell out
1.0,This product is poor quality just I returned I didn’t like anymore
1.0,"Described as French Terry. That is not the fabric, it's a cheap polyester tshirt blend. Will be sending back."
1.0,The top is stretch material while the shorts are wide and made with super cheap material.
1.0,"It came all tangled could untangle it,it literally was a giant messy knot and nothing i did could fix it, ended up tossing it im the trash,so disappointed I loved how it looked I'm picture what I got. Was nothing what I expected."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ea7adf5f8baa684d8696030c42bf4544]] Strap frayed & fell off after less than a month
1.0,"Was not at all what I wanted. 14k yellow gold try stainless steel, flimsy at that. Poor rating other then getting it on time through Amazon prime this is a bad buy. I recommend buying from a legitamate Jewler preferably local."
1.0,Won't even fit a child
1.0,Normally can wear a medium or large so as others said i ordered up in fact i ordered XL to be safe. It is just too tight and too small probably would need a 2xl if it were for medium
1.0,Does not come with directions on how to tie it... the Amazon ad shows all kinds of ways it can be tied--but you are on your own to figure it out--and most of the photos it does show are not able to be done with this dress.
1.0,This is a fake copy (Chinese-made) of the US military issue OCP/Multicam assault pack.<br />There is nothing authentic about the pack as they advertise it except that it looks like an exact replica of the real thing.  The authentic assault packs are made by US government contractors and are made in the USA to the highest standards.<br />This fake product uses cheap materials and is really just a bag for looks.  I wouldn’t use it in an outdoors application.<br />It’s a shame that they can make a replica bag with the letters US stamped on it and pass it off as the real thing.
1.0,"They are sorry and comfy, a little thicker than normal leggings. They started to pill immediately, this was prior to washing."
1.0,"The Bottoms Are Suuuuper Long, Which Actually Wasnt An Issue For Me I Thought It Was Cute. But It Wasnt True To Size. The Style Is Cute, But Just Didn’t Work Out For Me."
1.0,"The shirt was as expected when it arrived, however, after a single wash the lil Sebastian photo and lettering washed off completely. This is no way to honor Pawnee's finest.<br />Bye Bye Li'l Sebastian. You're like 10,000 cheap tshirts in a washing machine, evidently.. So disappointed. Leslie Knope would be outraged."
1.0,"The actual earring is too big, doesn’t fit as nice as it looks on description. Also the flower is super hard to screw back on when putting the earring on."
1.0,"Too small, and took too long to come"
1.0,Did nothing to keep my hands warm. Poorly made gloves that are not for winter use. The touchscreen fingertips work well though.
1.0,This is decorative and not a functional whistle.
1.0,"Having glasses and tackling the Sun is a constant issue for people wearing prescription sunglasses.<br /><br />I've tried numerous solutions, including clip-ons, prescription sunglasses, to just trying to deal with normal sunglasses without my glasses on.<br /><br />These polarized glasses had a lot of potential.  When initially received these fit properly and worked well for about 2 days.<br /><br />However, on the 3rd day during opening, the flimsy hinge just broke and rendered these completely useless.<br /><br />The build quality of the hinges, is extremely poor.<br /><br />I don't recommend these, unfortunately with this product you get what you pay for."
1.0,"This costume is not worth ordering. It doesn't live up to it's photo. It is very cheaply made and runs way too small. I am a regular size 8 and ordered a large (size 10-12) just to be safe and I couldn't barely get it over my head. Once I got it on it was way too short. It barely came to my crotch and I am only 5'6"".  The back also has a large opening around the neck area. I am not sure why this is. It just looked really strange and out of proportion. Save your money. I had to return it and pay a 20% re-stocking fee to the vendor. It wasn't worth it."
1.0,DO NOT buy this. It’s huge and too short for a dress too long for a top. The vendor will not pay to send back to China.
1.0,The sizing is WAY off!!
1.0,Was not happy. Brackett came broken.
1.0,Didn't last more then a month.  The bottoms wore out.
1.0,They arnt nice but I can't wear them. They are studded on both sides.
1.0,"Cheap junk! balsa wood, soft wood."
1.0,"Pockets were a plus, but leggings didn't stay put (kept having to pull them up) and the entire seam down the leg ripped after single use."
1.0,"Did not begin to fit my breasts in this bathing suit. If you have a longer torso like myself, do not attempt to purchase. The entire bathing suit is not long enough and is not accurate with sizing."
1.0,Falls off my head. Pretty useless. Doesn't fit my normal size head. Needs ties to hold on to your head otherwise even a slight breeze blows it off.<br />Too bad since the coverage is excellent.
1.0,The sleeves are too short and the material is see thru.  Very poor quality.  Sizing is also way off
1.0,"Not as pictured. Fabric was plastic-like and smelled weird. It hung weird, like it was too big but the top of it didn’t fit right, like it was too small."
1.0,Cheaply made and missing crystals.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,Very small made okay
1.0,Coloring and fabric style and stitching is nothing like the picture
1.0,"Boxy, wrinkly, cheap material. Not at all what I expected."
1.0,The product fell apart.
1.0,Very disappointed in this. No longer closes properly. Wasted my money evidently
1.0,Horrible... just horrible. They fit like my granny's garden pants.  They were not flattering or well made. I loved the picture I hated the product.
1.0,"Installed these lenses, and they were a perfect fit, and installed very easily.  Wore them a few times, and then this past week when on vacation I had worn them swimming.  Once out of the water, I rinsed them with fresh water, and cleaned the lenses with a soft cloth, and all of the polarizing wiped right off of the lenses, leaving the lenses looking terrible, and making them harder to see through.  Would not recommend."
1.0,not fully cover face and nose by a long shot
1.0,DO NOT BUY.... coming from China ...bad quality ... doesnt fit uptop ... too short and not flowy .. PICTURE IS NOT THE SAME DRESS .. DONT DO IT
1.0,The picture looks like brown and cream... but it's black and white. The strap is thin and not what I was wanting at all.  Not worth trying to return but not sure I'll ever use it :(
1.0,"The outfit runs small, ordered a large needed to get an extra large."
1.0,"This was not what I originally order, but I got were rusted and nasty.  I sent it back and reoder the item again and again got nasty, nasty earrings."
1.0,Measure belt loops this belt was too wide it didn’t fit thru loops
1.0,Worn by my daughter once for about 90 min in the pool and material is already pilling. I have not even washed this yet.
1.0,Nothing low rise about these. Material nice but also more like skinny jeans than boot cut. Went by size chart that said lg like med but these are way too big. Solo disappointed
1.0,"Horrible shoes!! Only lasted 2 times! Velcro doesn't stick, bottom of the shoes wore out after two wears."
1.0,Definitely at least 2 to 3 sizes too small. I could not even get my foot into the shoe. I have several family members with the same size feet as me attempt to even get their foot into the shoe to no avail. Even attempting to return this was hassle that took weeks and hours corresponding with Amazon.
1.0,Too skimpy
1.0,"The black from the material turned my skin grey,<br />The slit was to my croch."
1.0,Very pretty earrings but not sturdy at all. pity.
1.0,It is beautiful but one of the giraffes tail snapped off the same day I got it.  Now there is a sharp edge on the giraffe's butt.  I spent alot of money on this ring for this to happen the same day I received it 😡
1.0,Part received was half the size as the one shown in pic.  Do not buy.
1.0,So disappointed<br />It's SO small.
1.0,Watch band is short. So short that it came undone and sent my phone falling and braking the glass down to the inside of the phone. Don’t buy.
1.0,"They are cute, plastic not very durable either"
1.0,Was not I expected gave them as a gift my younger cousin liked them
1.0,"I expected much better quality and fit for what these cost me. They were always very loose, the lenses scratched very easily and the frames broke after 8 months of use. I would avoid these at all costs. The $15 Amazon Essential readers lasted longer and were way more durable."
1.0,This is nothing like the picture. It's not a flowing loose fit. I got the size up from my normal size and it still hugged to every part of my body. The belt was so short you could not make the bow in the picture. It also was not &#34;fluffy&#34;. It just hung there. The material is very cheap. I sent it back!!
1.0,Well they are about 10 times the size I expected so they are basically useless. I have never seen such gigantic earrings in my life. I would never wear them and don't know anyone else who would.
1.0,Don't buy it!
1.0,I expected it to look a lot more like the picture when it was on. It’s much shorter in length and the fabric is awful.
1.0,They ran too small and the finish was poor and quality of the fabric was subpar considering the brand name.
1.0,"Suit had a lot of potential in the pictures, but the fabric contained hardly any strechiness given its content and the suit runs way big.  I would not buy again, sorry"
1.0,"These look nothing like the picture. I purchased both the purple and the rainbow, the material is a puckered polyester which makes them super stretchy. Could be a plus for some people, but for me, I like compression and not having to worry about them stretching out while I'm working out. When I put my phone in the pocket and it stretched and hung out. This will not work on heavy cardio days and I refuse to wear a fanny pack.<br />The seams are white and accentuate the illusion of a fupa and a cameltoe. Once again, could be a selling point to some? Just not for me.<br /><br />Now for the difference between what I thought I was getting and what I got. The colors are not that bright, with the cheap looking fabric, the guy who accepted the return at Amazon didn't think they were the same shorts. I said, ""yeah that's why I'm returning them"". If you want vibrant colors, compression, good patterns with pockets spend a little more on CVG."
1.0,Not very well made at all.  Fell apart with only holding a few pairs of googles.  Do not waste your money.
1.0,Cheap imported hat! The brim is much shorter than pictured. And it's much too small! The circumference is exactly 20.5&#34; to 21&#34;.  Please do not buy!
1.0,I am not sure what size chart this company uses but I could get my head through the head opening.  This fit more like an extra small.  One of the many problems with clothing made in China
1.0,Material is very thin and see through and fits more like a moomoo.
1.0,Ok but won't improve a crappy seat like polishing a turd
1.0,"believe it might be quite protective; however, it fell off with 5 days of my purchase.....believe it got snagged on something."
1.0,nothing like the picture I send it back
1.0,Large pockets we're great but the xx large pants were not to scale
1.0,These are so cheaply made. They were delivered today and almost broke when I first unclipped them. Definitely not worth $10!! Looks like something you would buy from the Dollar Tree.
1.0,Loved them until 6 weeks later when one stopped working
1.0,Too thin. Cheap fabric.  Neck hole is very small.
1.0,"Was much smaller than usual sizing ( xlg for like a Med)… was soft, but not like a sweatshirt, slicker synthetic type material,  loved the colors, just didn’t fit…  company contacted me to take half the $ for refund and keep the product, very bad, I said no, I need a full refund and it doesn’t fit. Why would I keep it… then they offered 60% refund and keep the product… still I said no!! Refund the full amount and then they said okay, send it back and they did eventually refund full amount…  what part of it doesn’t fit, did you not understand?"
1.0,"Have not tried this dress on my grand daughter yet but my observations thus far are:  Received dress very tightly packaged and very wrinkled. There was no designer tag on the dress only a very small 5/6 China tag. There was no fabric content or care tag, which piqued my interest. The shoulder straps have no secure fastening other than a self tie, leaving the straps susceptible to coming untied and the dress falling off of a playing child. The fabric was not a quality cotton or cotton blend. I prewashed the dress hoping to remove the wrinkles. Sadly all did not release and steam ironing was necessary. Even with the aid of light body spray the fabric did not achieve the look desired.  I will not recommend this item, not worth the price."
1.0,Not a good experience with this purchase. I am very disappointed.
1.0,"I was soooooo excited to order this skirt, I followed the sizing guidelines and WOW. The green skirt is so clearly much much much smaller then the other patterns they offer. The size small says it’s for a size 4, great because I’m a size 2. Nope. This skirt would be too small for a size ZERO. I actually laughed when I took it out of the packaging. Which is sad because I was really excited to wear it 🤦‍♀️"
1.0,"Poor quality.  Does not look like the picture.  Smaller ball, less fluffy rim.  You can purchase better quality for the same price at your local CVS or Walgreens."
1.0,"These earrings discolored so bad. Only wore them once. Threw them in the garbage, I was so mad, cheap earrings in Wal-Mart hold up better!!!"
1.0,"I purchased these goggles as a further way to protect myself from those who do not believe in wearing masks during the COVID pandemic.  They are NOT anti-fog.  When I have my mask on, then put the goggles on, they still get EXTREMELY FOGGED UP.  That is not cool.  I won't return them because I didn't want to bother - but for anyone on the fence about whether these might be for them - DON'T BUY THESE, they are GARBAGE."
1.0,Got tangled as soon as I opened it.
1.0,"This thing is a joke! What a waste of my hard earned money. I should have known better. If you sweat heavy like me, DON'T do it.... My sweat laughed at it, bypassed it and went straight into my eyes. Wear this ONLY if you're interested in looking cute and keeping your hair off your face during your workouts, which is why it earned the one star from me, I'll give it that much credit. SMH"
1.0,Poor quality. Very cheap fabric.
1.0,"Knot on one coming undone on the first day, silver color also gone"
1.0,"I loved the purse at first with all the pockets. After getting the purse all set up the main zipper got stuck and I couldn't open it. My dad had to break the zipper so I could get to my wallet. After looking to see what got stuck in the zipper, I found there was nothing but defect in the purse."
1.0,Makes ur head stink
1.0,Just opened the package and a button is already tore off :(
1.0,"WAY TOO SMALL.  I wear a 1-2x I ordered a 4x.  It is too small for my size 0, 15 year old daughter."
1.0,This hat was like a little kids hat and did not fit and was so cheap .
1.0,Hadn't had it a few days zipper tore up
1.0,"this is not a sweatshirt, or a sweater. it is a cotton tee shirt."
1.0,it was not as described
1.0,Super tiny READ DIMENSIONS
1.0,Today ihave got abroken wris watch idlike you to take theproper measures
1.0,"I am 5 ft 100lbs. This was so huge, I swam in it and it’s long like a dress. Very mislead by pics"
1.0,Thought it was stainless steel which I prefer for teens bc it’s cheap enough if they lose it and it doesn’t tarnish. This turned black within  3 days and was thrown away.
1.0,I returned because they look like plastic. They are cheap and you get what you pay for in this case.
1.0,Too small for anyone but a child. Waste of money.
1.0,"They are already tearing and I haven't had them very long. They keep moving so that the cover half my foot, looking very odd with my flats. Overall very disappointed"
1.0,Awful sound and plays 2 sounds that both suck.
1.0,Battery stopped working less than a month after receiving it
1.0,The medium is the size of a moo-moo (sp?).
1.0,Made cheap and very hot will use in the winter for Pj
1.0,Very uncomfortable and too hot to wear or breathe and
1.0,The clasp is extremely difficult to open and close. I bought it for an older lady. No way could she use it!
1.0,"Not durable. I’ve had 2 break within 2 months. Very, very cute, but I would have it for decoration as a purse charm rather than a phone strap that will be used daily."
1.0,Very small. Fabric / knot is very thin.
1.0,"The lights in one of the shoes stopped working 2 days after the 30 day grace period, but only the 2nd time wearing them bc they were purchased for school so they weren't worn for a couple of weeks after purchase! No way to exchange item that isn't working!"
1.0,I didn’t like it at all. Wish I would of kept the package would send it back
1.0,The image is blurry and the wrong size. You can't even tell what it is. At least you can benefit from my lost money.
1.0,"I loved the way the dress fit me but the stitching was terrible and the quality even worse. Kinda sad to have to return, color was super cute and I feel I could’ve rocked this if it weren’t for the poor stitching that made it look super super cheap. Returning."
1.0,These are cheaply made
1.0,It does not fit under the seat. It broke on our first trip. All the extra pockets inside take way too much room. Not very flexible
1.0,The masks you get are nothing like what they show in the pictures so don't think you're getting what you see very unhappy.
1.0,"Costume package was open,  outfit stuffed in,  wrinkled,  tights stretched,  gloves show fingers pulled in bc they've been worn. Nope! This costs too much to receive a used one."
1.0,Garbage- price gouging piece of sheet. Hope you croke!
1.0,These are terrible quality. While my left glove wasn't too bad the right glove was an absolute mess with runs in the fabric and stitching that was falling out right from the package.
1.0,The pendant came separate from the chain. The clasp on the chain is too big to slip through the pendant. Dumb.
1.0,I ordered this to give to my son as he departed for the Middle East.  The word &#34;Remember&#34; was mis-spelled.
1.0,Nice quality watch. However I had to return it because the clip will not adjust due to a band issue. I am taking a chance and we ordering another watch
1.0,Cheap quality shirt. Would never buy again.
1.0,This dress is poorly stitched. The fit was horrible. The slip wasn’t regular length it kept rising. Pretty dress but DO NOT purchase!!!
1.0,"ran waaaay too small! I wear a medium  to large. It said it ran small., so I ordered a 3 x. So small it was two inches from closing, and the shirt only went below my belly button. Nothing like the picture. Very disappointed."
1.0,There are a few reasons why nobody is wearing this shirt in the display photo.<br /> This thing looks like you are wearing a curtain that was stolen from your in laws and then haphazardly modified into a shirt.<br />The collar is not low cut. It is extremely low sagging.<br /> Save yourself the disappointment and the money. Do not purchase this shirt.
1.0,Key does not work the bracelot at all and the stone on key pendant isnt blue like picture shown.
1.0,Way to short inseam!
1.0,Made pretty decent but did not fit like any other glove. Kept riding up and making my fingers slip out because it was so tight around my knuckles.
1.0,Gonna be a no from me.
1.0,"I wasn't sure about magnetic bands but thought I would give this one a try. When I got it, it went on better than any others and I was happy with how well the magnet held. However, it was short lived. About 2 weeks ago, I bought it towards the end of May, the magnet stopped holding as well. It started slipping out of place. I was going to switch bands back when I realized the little pin that helps slide the pin for the band, BROKE OFF! Now, I can't take the band off my Versa 2 and stuck with it. If the magnet stops holding the band on, I will have a Versa 2 I can't wear that I have 2 months."
1.0,These bags ripped open at the bottom the first time I used them.
1.0,"A Roman numeral on this watch dial is incorrect: at the 20 minute mark is shown IIII when in fact the correct Ronan numeral for 4 is IV. At this price, there is no excuse for this blatant mistake. Anyone who has purchased this watch, should ask for an immediate refund. Anyone seeing it on your wrist will assume you are as ignorant as the manufacturer who produced it."
1.0,So sorry to say this but these earrings arrived broken and missing four of the dangling beads.
1.0,The clasp of necklace was jammed and would not open.
1.0,these suck
1.0,This is a crop tank top the many pictures show otherwise. Runs small go a size up
1.0,It broke the first day my son wore the lace. Very disappointed with the company customer service. Over a month and never replace the defective item
1.0,cheap and ineffectual.  Returned.
1.0,Looks and feels way too cheap
1.0,I wanted to really like these shoes but the first day I got them one of the bows started coming off. I had to super glue the bows. Now the velcro is coming off the shoe. So disappointing because my daughter loves these shoes but can't wear them
1.0,Cheaply made. Cheap material
1.0,the coating wore off after only having it in a few days
1.0,So annoying...
1.0,"I have returned it. Russel sweat shirts fit differently buying directly from an athletic store. This one's sleeves were huge, the same as the one bought at Xmas. I thought that one was sized incorrectly, but this new purchase was the same."
1.0,Bought it for a gift found out he has beer belly. Won’t hold a beverage
1.0,Well I ordered XX Large and it was miles too small. It arrived when I was on vacation so I couldn't return. It came direct from China by the looks of the shipment and had no mfg label or label of any kind on the shirt. No docs also. I paid about $20 and it is a couple waste of money. Initially I thought it had not arrived but did find it in my vacation mail. I wrote to mfg. and they said ......tough luck!!
1.0,"These are fake, they say they there rated for 200nm-2000nm that’s more than the visible light you can see, the fact you can see through them means it’s fake."
1.0,I wanted a cute casual dress for the summer and this dress was a disappointment. It looked like a sheet was folded in half and sewn. There's 2 strings you can tie to make it fit your waist but it was right on my tatas and very awkward looking. Buy a different dress
1.0,They slide down. Waste of money
1.0,The shirt would t fit over my 3 month olds head. The actual shirt would have fit fine otherwise. Poor quality control on this one.
1.0,Product stated runs small. So I ordered the next size up. An xxl looked more like a size small.
1.0,too small for 7.5' wrist
1.0,Very poor quality. Cheaply made. Not worth your money.
1.0,These pants have enough stretch that I'm sure you could put them on a whale however if you are plus size these pants are like low riders
1.0,It is very bad. Because it broke first time. I don't use any time.
1.0,"Do not spend anything on this. Super misleading. Terrible fabric, horrible design, I can not emphasize enough!!!! Bait and switch warning!! POS headed your way."
1.0,It was very wrinkled. Nearly impossible to get rid of the wrinkles.  Small fit
1.0,Broken upon delivery.
1.0,They were very loose and would not stay in place. Very disappointed.
1.0,Returned these are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND USELESS
1.0,Flimsy.  Okay if you stand up straight and don't move your head.
1.0,"Extremely small fit.  Ordered a 2X for my son who usually wears a XL, because of small size warnings.  It did not fit.  We sent it back.  We then ordered a 3X.  It's still too small, but it's the largest size possible.  He likes the shirt, but it's not comfortable to wear at all."
1.0,"Wore these twice, washed them once, the seam is separating in two places."
1.0,Quit working after just a couple of days.😠
1.0,"Wayyyyyy to small to be a 1x, didn’t even come pass my stomach so disappointed!!"
1.0,"Within a couple shifts at work, the black coating where the lanyard clips onto the badge has already started wearing off to bare metal.  I communicated to Govo and they said they’re working on a better product/coating in the future…awesome…<br /><br />Do your research and check the reviews.  Depending on industry, your product may wear quickly and no longer hold its professional appeal.  Support from Govo is not customer friendly."
1.0,returned run very small
1.0,The collar of the dress rolls around everywhere and doesn't stay flat. Sleeves are too short. Fabric shows all lines of undergarments. Returned immediately.
1.0,These weren’t earrings at all. Looked like they were made foe a nose ring or eyebrow ring
1.0,I returned it bc I didn't realize it was a children's size hoodie
1.0,"The keychain was small and flat. It's all metal and just kinda painted, it's barely 3D. I was disappointed in it, although if it was something from the dollar store I'd be happy with it. But when you pay $10 you expect it to be worth it, and this was not even close."
1.0,They are supposed to be M/L then are so tight it’s hard to get them on.
1.0,"I am giving this 1 star because while the watch looks adorable, I received it with missing rhinestones and it doesn’t work. I even tried multiple new batteries with no luck."
1.0,1.  Came ripped.<br />2.  Extremely thin.<br />3.  Good for wide feet.<br />4.  Look cute and feel soft.<br />5.  Not worth $16.00
1.0,"The first time I opened these up the lens popped out. I put it back in. The next time I opened them, the frame snapped. Don’t buy these! Waste of money!"
1.0,"No recomiendo venian danadas varias,  ya no las pude regresar porque llegaron justo para el evento y solo use las que estaban buenas."
1.0,Horribly Cheap looking and arrived cracked. Poorly packaged way to expensive
1.0,"Absolutely terrible... the quality of the material is cheap and the dress is very poorly made. The neck line is way too tight (made me feel like I was choking. The gold neck line is sewen together material. I am only 5’3” and the length is too short (doesn’t even come to my ankles). The under slip only goes to about mid-thigh. The color is more red than wine. It fits like a small, other than being too short. I thought I would give it a try but I am returning it immediately. If you are looking for a cheap costume, it may work for that."
1.0,"This scarf smells like kerosene, is scratchy, very thin in fabric, and nowhere near as wide or full sized as the picture makes it appear. I am sending it back."
1.0,"Llegó roto, tuve que devolverlo."
1.0,Tight waist band and bunches up. Not comfy! Cheap junk!
1.0,Waited several weeks to receive this face mask that doesn't have any sequin or glitter. So disappointed with this item. Don't buy this face mask if you're looking for something that sparkles.
1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Bought these for my wife and one of them broke the very first time she wore them. The entire lower half separated from the upper because where the link is attached to the upper portion completely separated. Nothing short of soldering the link back would fix that. If possible I would give this zero stars!!!
1.0,The patina/finish on the buckle is nothing like what is pictured. I sent the item back.
1.0,I was so excited for this shirt I loved the rainbow however the decal came very messed up and the entire rainbow was red and very pixilated. Not good quality
1.0,"Completely broken when recieved, hinge and light dont work. Cracked. I want my money back. Bubble bag osnt enough to protect the box."
1.0,"The pictured hat was a nice looking fitted cap with the adjustable back strap.  However, the hat arrived in the pictured package completely flattened. It will never be as nice as what was pictured.  Color is exactly what I wanted and the logo is excellent.  The hat looks awful. I out their photo on the right and my new hat is on the left.  Not the same."
1.0,"Disappointing, very cheaply made"
1.0,Waist of time buying this product.  nothing like the picture and quality is very poor.
1.0,"I ordered a white distressed cap and i recieved a brown colored hat, please beware of recieving different hat colors than you have wanted"
1.0,"I've purchased these many times before from Wal-Mart, but they've stopped carrying them so I purchased them here through Amazon.  I usually wear a size 8, so I ordered what was advertised 8-10.  They are way to small."
1.0,"Bought for my wife, and it was too small even for my daughter. I'm not sure where they find girls with these freakishly small heads."
1.0,I received the mask. It was a cute mask until it came used. Not impressed with receiving a used dirty mask. I am never buying from this company again.
1.0,I did not like the quality and have returned this item
1.0,Forget these shorts if you are a size 12 or above.  Should be advertised as children's shorts.
1.0,"The reddish beige dress is BRIGHT orange. This dress isn’t baggy at all like it is in the picture. It’s skin tight and the sleeves are way shorter than pictured, too. This thing just looks like a twisted up blob when it isn’t being worn, it isn’t recognizable as a dress. After paying almost 50 dollars for this after shipping, I’m really not pleased. Maybe go with black if you want this dress. But you might get a completely different color, like I did."
1.0,"beautiful color, couldn't get my boobs into it though"
1.0,The front was printed on the back and vise versa.  Sent back for a refund.  My daughter was very upset.
1.0,"I am glad I didn't buy more than one Doublju product, as I had intended to. I am 125 lbs soaking wet, and an extra large was tight in the waist, chest, and arms. The weight of the collar doesn't let it sit comfortably. The fabric is thin. you can't even wear it as open as shown in the picture without poor stitching from the &#34;pocket&#34; showing from the inside. If I could return it without a fee, I would."
1.0,Low quality iron on.  Save your coins.
1.0,Definitely not the same as the picture used to advertise the hands. I even messaged to make sure they were shipping the hands in the pic. They were not!
1.0,Item turned black and even if i take the ring off it never changes colors only black. Even on other people it never changes. Not a mood ring at all.
1.0,"If you can try a different brand hopefully it will be better.<br />One of this bags zipper started to rip off after a couple weeks of use, it is disappointing."
1.0,Fell apart first time laundered
1.0,Price and the back came off
1.0,fell apart two days into my trip.
1.0,cool shirt too bad it was ripped when it got here.
1.0,I didn't like that the socks ripped after only my second use it would be great if you can send me another pair maybe XXX this time
1.0,It does not give a true statement about the size. Have ordered twice and shoe does not fix.
1.0,"This is such a waste of money! First and foremost, it will 100% turn your finger green. Secondly, it’s much larger in person than pictured. Instead of something cute and dainty like it appears in the photos it is big, bulky, and looks like a class ring. Also the stone is way darker in person and looks super cheap. Spend a little bit more and get something better than this."
1.0,Waste of money do not buy!! Very cheaply made for the price charged! Had less than 2 months and they are already falling apart! Have had way less expensive slippers in the past last much longer and are more comfortable! Junk!
1.0,No rain cover like advertised.  Started packing for 1st trip to the Amazon & the seem is ripping near the shoulder strap.  Very disappointed as now I dont feel I can trust the product on the trip!
1.0,Sizing chart is way off! They seller was prompt at returning message.  it was about 4 sizes to small  Beware of the sizing chart they said they were going to change it to the correct sizing standards hopefully they will
1.0,"Definitely notnas expected. Fits loose on the chest and waist which was ok, but it was also too bignon the sleeves. But shorter than expected. It was too late to return"
1.0,These were one of my rare amazon returns. They fit badly and the fabric was coarse. Spend more money and get better pants.
1.0,"Order 2 size bigger than you normally would.  I'm a size 9, ordered size 10, and still had a very tight fit.  The shoe has very low cut, with practically no ankle support.  Shoe lace length was so short that I was unable to tie a proper knot."
1.0,"I do not believe these are actually surgical stainless steel. I am very sensitive to nickle and cannot wear other metals.<br />I have purchsed this item twice. The first time, they worked great! Until I lost a few too many and had to purchase more.<br />On the second purchase, I have had nothing but problems with my ears while wearing these.<br />I will be looking for surgical steel studs elsewhere."
1.0,"It looks like it comes to mid-thigh in the pics but barely covered by torso.  Outside material is a cheap, shiny slick polyester.  Sent it back."
1.0,Did not like at all. Very cheaply made and cheap looking. Bought a second pendent that looked like a different color (purple) in picture turned out it was the same pendent just without the earrings and bracelet. Both were blue. Very disappointed. Will be returning if I can
1.0,This bracelet was broken when it arrived.l would like a new one.
1.0,"They run small, and came late."
1.0,"Dangly too far down and stone wont stay upright, it hangs aiming toward floor."
1.0,The latch broke within 2 days of having it.
1.0,This wasn't a gold color but more of a rose colored and looked very cheap. Returbing
1.0,Lied about when it would arrive. Says next day then 2 months later...
1.0,"Sent it right back. Need to size up 3 sizes. Also see-thru, cheaply made."
1.0,The chest part of the suit is very ill-fitting. Had to return it.
1.0,These are not comfortable to wear. It hurt the inside of my nose.. it was a waste of my money.
1.0,It’s a crop top!!! Does not match description.
1.0,"Don't buy these shoes. Bought them for my son, who is hard on shoes, but didn't even last 2 months. I was expecting at least 6 months.  They started to fall apart almost as soon as we got them. First with the loop in the back coming off. Then shoelaces falling apart, followed by the lace hole ripping off. The tread wore down extremely fast. The soles are falling apart and they look like trash now. Which is exactly where they are going."
1.0,This skirt runs large but even worse it has a pattern on either side near the hip area that you can’t see from the photo
1.0,I did not like the cheap material. I wish I can return it.
1.0,This blazer is sized very small and not a boy friend style.  It is short and fitted.  It is also very cheaply made
1.0,turned black in 1 month
1.0,"Runs very small, I'll return or give away.  Based off reviews before ordering I ordered. Wrong, review ratings"
1.0,I wore this to a work event and immediately regretted it.  If you sit down or walk fast the stockings start to fall down. I had to go to the bathroom several times to readjust and then I needed up not sitting at all during the event for fear of embarrassing myself. I've never had this issue before.
1.0,Looks like it could be cute but way too small
1.0,Dindnt like it has a super strong smell. But are cute
1.0,"already coming apart-use to keep 90 year old lady's legs warm-handicapped, so very little abuse to product-very disappointed"
1.0,I wore these socks for approximately four hours in one day. After taking my shoes off the material had completely thinned out and there was already a hole in the sock. The socks had never been washed. They are extremely thin and poor material.
1.0,"Colors fade very easily, they are very durable."
1.0,"Fits the 7 series, but the parts that slide in are too wide and stick out. Wish I knew before buying."
1.0,Few were changing color
1.0,The mask is so small it covers my nose and upper lip it fits my 3 year old perfectly so if you want a mask for a child get this one
1.0,"The shelf bra was way too small. It reminded me of the size you'd find in a girl's tank top, not a grown woman's. The overall top was too tight. However, it was also way too long. It reached halfway between my knees and my hips. I returned these because there was no way I could make them work for me."
1.0,Don’t waste your money please
1.0,Wrong color. Do not like fabric.
1.0,"poor quality, I do not recommend it"
1.0,"I love the color, but unfortunately it is very uncomfortable. The buckle part digs into my wrist and will not lay flat. I’m upset I spent money on this and it hurts to wear it"
1.0,shoddy I need your help
1.0,Looked like a child sewed the dress
1.0,Calf area is too small.  I ordered the largest size and I can't zip them up at all.  Probably work well for smaller legs.
1.0,the small ball on top would not stay screwed on.
1.0,"Sizing is wildly inaccurate. I could wear it on a single leg, but it would still cut off circulation."
1.0,Very dissapoonted in these rings. My husband can't wear them anymore. They caused him to get white blisters and constant skin pealing.
1.0,The shirt isn’t the best quality. The material is papery. It balloons out around the chest too. Not flattering on me. Returned.
1.0,Too small.  Very dissapointed.<br />Poor quality.
1.0,"They look like belly rings, but we could not open a single one to be used. Neither ball on neither one will twist."
1.0,Ok. It ran pretty small though.
1.0,These are sooooooo big I will return them. The colors are beautiful but these are too large for anyone's toes!!!!
1.0,After wearing for 4 days the stone fell out!!!
1.0,"This product is NOT the color as statement in the description, is brown yes, but NOT DARK BROWN, I dyed my vintage Louis Vuitton Noe purse and after dryed the color was a weird color, definitely not DARK BROWN it's like brownish with  kind of green metallic  shades.<br />In person the purse looks totally green!"
1.0,"The size is way off, looks better than when received."
1.0,Gross!! Mask was open and used when I received it!! 🤮
1.0,There is something odd about the cut of the trousers. It seems every step I take my trousers edge downwards. It is as if they sewed the legs back to front.
1.0,"Well, this dress was too small for me so it already had to go back. However, the hem line on the dress was completely crooked. The left side was at least an inch (if not more) longer than the rest of the dress. Also, the lace that lined the v-neck was placed incorrectly and had the lace in the middle of the sheer v-neck fabric. I was very sad it did not fit, but even more sad that this dress was not made well."
1.0,"I always check carefully for products from China because the fit is never right. And of course, when I got these dresses because I bought two, they didn’t fit correctly. When I printed the return labels I was surprised to find that even with prime I had to pay postage and it was back to China. I am very disappointed in both Amazon and these dresses."
1.0,My daughter is two and I bought a 4t. It doesn't cover her bottom. It looks like a shirt on her and she is petite for her age.
1.0,TERRIBLE!  Too big & bent with first use.
1.0,The material doesn't stretch and is tight through the shoulders and chest. I sized up and it still did not fit. The shorts are also see through.
1.0,The package was open and plastic bag was all ripped.
1.0,Didn’t order
1.0,"Shirt arrived crumpled up in the bag, lots of wrinkles, careless handling. Lettering isn’t white as pictured. Neck is way oversized. Overall terrible quality and will be returned."
1.0,I’ve had this purse for less than 1 month and it’s coming apart already. There is a hole between the zipper and lining of the purse. Not only is it coming apart but the design isn’t good at all. It’s extremley difficult to find anything in the purse due to the very narrow opening.
1.0,I was so excited when this arrived. It looks very pretty in person but the darn thing broke as I was putting it on. Glad I only spent $3 on this thing. I'm going to attempt to put my own clasp and chain on it because it really is pretty and I want to wear it.
1.0,I received the wrong style AND size in my order.
1.0,The skirt is much darker than advertised and described and when I tried to request a return the seller cancelled without contacting me directly. Do not buy if you want pure white
1.0,"I'm a Ghostbusters fan, I've probably bought more than ten PKEs on Amazon, a recently purchased product had a problem with the screen display, I took it apart to confirm the problem (yes I lost the cost one to find out the problem), I found on the screen The number of holes and lamps do not match. There are more expensive options in the store. I bought a more expensive option to get a normal one. If the cheap one is a defective product, please note it to everyone."
1.0,The fabric is a flat cheap looking polyester.  It is NOT as pictured at all! No crinkle or gathering!
1.0,"The piece was so tiny it got lost in my necks, smh then they wanted to charge me $7 to send it back. The necklace is wasn’t even worth that much."
1.0,This bag was way too large to carry as a handbag and I had to see it back!
1.0,Been two months and already breaking.
1.0,Terrible quality. See photo of how mine arrived. The threading is coming loose and the end clasps are so tight it’s a hassle trying to connect the mask to the lanyard. Terrible purchase.
1.0,China garbage!!
1.0,smelt like mold had to send it back
1.0,"After a few weeks it started to change color, and here I thought it was 925 which I stealing silver????? But this ring not only changed colors on me but also change my finger green. 😭😭"
1.0,"This item was a spring ring clasp with a separate reindeer. Did not look at all like pic, it was cheap and broken."
1.0,"These masks were so tight I could hardly get them over my head. When I did, they were so tight around my neck, they were choking me."
1.0,"The fabric is like a swim suit,  shockingly hideous!"
1.0,I was hoping the dress would work after reading the reviews. The style was cute but it could be something to wear over a swim suit. The fabric was extremely see-thru and thin. I returned it.
1.0,This broke after one week. The closure broke off where it can not be repaired.
1.0,Not made for 36DD
1.0,Very cheaply made. The clasp for the strap was broken so at random times the strap would flt off and eveeythingt would fly everywhere because the lock for the purse would fly open as well. It is also very stiff and awkward to carry. It doesn't feel natural.
1.0,Lol I don’t have a picture of it. But the quality was poor for my 5 year old
1.0,It was wrinkled and unattractive
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!! This is not at all what is described. It is a two piece and the top is so small there is no way any woman with boobs could wear it. It doesn't even cover my boobs let alone ANY of my stomach. VERY disappointed.
1.0,Wore for 3 hours and the green on my skin appeared 😡
1.0,"The hat came broken and unraveling at the top. Poorly made. The material is also inflexible so if it is misshapen like this one was, it won’t actually fit. Not a “floppy” sun hat by any means. It was also huge on my 15 month old and by the time she would have fit in it, the little purse would be way too small to use. This product is worth *maybe* $5 if it isn’t broken."
1.0,Does not secure cards in the folded pouch AT ALL.
1.0,"Beware as this listing contains false information. I was looking for more of a cotton, jersey knit sweater material. The listing says this cardigan is 100% cotton. The color also appears as a nice fall, mustardy color. Lastly the cut appears to be longish in the back, past your butt for sure, with a longer, hanky hem in the front. None of these things are correct. The tag on the item said 35% cotton, 65% polyester. But the actual fabric is 95% polyester 5% spandex. In addition, the color is more of an unpleasant yellow, and the fit is a bit shorter than it would appear in the picture. At the end of the day the color and the fit were tolerable, but the material was completely different than what is listed and therefore what I expected, and is also simply very cheap feeling."
1.0,it wasn't jeggings it wasn't jeans it was the same material as a pillow case if that helps you better visualize. total scam for me.
1.0,"the hand of the second  came off from the beginning , and the other hands do not move properly"
1.0,inferior quality!!
1.0,These lenses are too LARGE. It’s not even close. I will post pics. (Black lense is the original Oakley lens’s. The clear lenses are what I ordered). The specs are not even close to fitting the frame. What a rip off. I would like a refund.
1.0,I was not happy with the way it fit!
1.0,I've been looking for no show socks for awhile and I bought 3 different brands to compare. These were my least favorite. I only tried on one foot and didn't even bother trying on the other. I wear a size 9 and was very tight and the fabric stretched so much I could see my  toe nail polish through the black fabric. I  don't know how so many are giving these such high reviews. Maybe if your foot was smaller and you like thin socks it might be for you but otherwise I'd recommend the bambu brand.
1.0,"Even though the bracelets came in a cute little bag, 3 of the 6 bracelets were missing the studs or metal attachments on them. I was able to superglue them on and give them as a gift, but I shouldn't have to superglue $20 bracelets."
1.0,"Not light weight, not good quality"
1.0,"The picture of the shirt is gorgeous! However, when I received the shirt, it was too large, I ordered a medium and this is easily a Large to Xl. After looking it over I realized the Bear is a plastic sticker. “Mama Bear” is not cut out, it’s  actual color on the sticker. The White on the sticker has pink smeared throughout, almost like they didn’t wait for it to dry and smeared it. The first wash and this shirt will be ruined. I suggest finding a company that company put a long lasting decal on the shirt."
1.0,"I bought these pajamas because they stated 100% cotton. Digging deeper into the ad, I saw that it was listed as 95% cotton and 5% spandex but  I thought that I would try them anyway. They're actually 95% rayon. These are pajamas with shorts that I purchased specifically for the warm weather, but rayon doesn't breathe. Not what was advertised."
1.0,Poor favorite quality and the color is off
1.0,"Took over 2 months to finally arrive. Really? Total ripoff. Also, way too small."
1.0,It is way to long.  It wears nothin like the photo
1.0,"Very disappointed with the product top was to small and bottoms to big couldn't even wear it , for the price I was upset because now I have a bathing suit i can't wear ..."
1.0,The chain bus really cheap and the charm is super small
1.0,The whole purpose of comfort was not served took it a hike. While it solved the problem of neck pressure from neck strap it just would not stay on the side and kept coming in front . Annoying
1.0,Cheaply made and unsure if authentic.  Returned item
1.0,These pants arrived with a hole in the leg stitching. It's about 3 inches in length. I am not a happy customer!
1.0,Very very very very small. Did not think they would be babyfied.
1.0,Basically: cheap material that didn't stand up to sweat and are already worn away (see through) after one night's wear. I had to wear protective pasties which I don't usually care for unless my breasts are fully exposed; if I hadn't it would have been a treacherous endeavor. It is also much heavier than you would think which made it hang strangely and dig into my shoulders. There was not one moment wearing it where I wasn't worried about how it looked or felt which really kept me from being present. Absolutely not buying this type of chain bra/shirt again and considering steering clear of the vendor as I don't believe all versions of this style are as low-quality.
1.0,"Cheap, not the tartan in post."
1.0,"It breaks easily, happened a a few months after getting it in the mail. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,ok product  problem with cleaning
1.0,Looks like cheap plastic
1.0,Wow. I was only a little bummed that this swimsuit was just too short for me. I’m only 5’2 (135lbs) and the medium just looked bad.<br />But then to find out I have to pay to return it? Uh no. Buyer beware. Look somewhere else for a cute swimsuit.
1.0,Why are all shirts made for fat people? This shirt is not a slim fit FYI. Dudes stop drinking beer and run once and a while! Almost every shirt I get looks like a gd circus tent!
1.0,"RIPPED. Don’t buy this crap. First day wearing these, and they ripped. I bought size medium. I wear size 4 in pants. They aren’t tight at all. And they ripped like WHAT. Please if you are the owner send me a new pair. Or refund me. This is ridiculous."
1.0,It worked only for a week. The band took off after a week and it is what happened to the cover
1.0,I loved these earrings for the entire week they lasted. The one of the earrings broke off the back
1.0,"The quality of these socks weren't expected to be amazing, but they were so terrrible. Paper thin with no real shape in the heal and worse elastic on the shin"
1.0,Just some more colored plastic that turns bright white lights into bright yellow lights; no polarization or filtering that I can detect.
1.0,This bracelet stay stretched out of shape when I tried to put it on my wrist! Unlike others that have ordered that I can reshape to fit once it’s put in my wrist
1.0,"I purchased before a 4 week trip out of the country. 2  of the zippers broke the first time I used them, right out of the package. By the time return d it was to late to return to amazon. The most poorly made product I've purchased from amazon. Straight inronth garbage. Waste of money and materials"
1.0,Not what I expected. I need wider bands.
1.0,"There is no way I would wear these out of the house, they are very thin and very see through! Guess I can sleep in them."
1.0,It ripped apart after 1 time of me wearing it. It looks very good on a picture but the quality is terrible.
1.0,"Like the shoes and the price point. Comfortable. Worn two weeks, only 10 working days and already falling apart. Extremely disappointing!"
1.0,These are really uncomfortable. They are not made for tall people.
1.0,it has plastic frame and look very cheap
1.0,"Highly disappointed. After reading countless reviews I decided to order this bra. It's obviously not meant for people with bigger breasts. I feel like a busted can of biscuits up top, everything just flowing over and out. The size I ordered was the same as all my V.S. bras, this comes no where close to fit. Would not recommend to anyone unless you're a B or smaller."
1.0,The top didn’t look good
1.0,Very cheaply made!!! Not at all like the picture!!!! Extremely unsatisfied and disappointed
1.0,Poorly glued so broken upon arrival.  Really cute though.
1.0,I wear a size 4 and the large shorts were too small.
1.0,"Different of the picture ,,!!<br /><br />Looks terrible quality"
1.0,"This is the first time ordering this specific product and will also be the last. Every year we hand out glow necklaces and candy on Halloween. Kids and parents alike love the necklaces. Parents because of the safety factor. I just received my order and activated several of them to make sure they worked. All of them so far have large gaps where there are air pockets which don’t glow, even after 10 minutes.  In years past I expected one or two to have small pockets but this is too much."
1.0,"This item was very cute but began to unravel almost instantly upon my first wearing. There were long strings and the tassels were tangled. Not a cute look, and it drew more attention to the upper thigh area where it was malfunctioning. I had to throw it away later that night."
1.0,Sent back symbol was crooked
1.0,I do not like the material. The legs are too wide and the waist/stomach area of the pant material is no good. I need to return this. It sis arrive fast and I wish it was a different material.
1.0,"Did not get a white band. They packed two black bands plus red, green, and gray. Just now the buckle fell off the gray silicone strap and into my lap. Not 5 hours old!"
1.0,broke within 1 week of purchasing.
1.0,I didn’t like it the material is cheap
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7ab8c745328c65ae477a364fcd025c0e]] As you can see it came apart in one month
1.0,"What a joke this hat is/was.  It was way too small for my head, and I do not have an unusually large head circumference.  Also to say that it is &#34;sun protective&#34; is a complete joke given that there is a wide band of fairly large mesh fabric that circles the top of your head, allowing all kinds of sun and uv rays to hit your head if you do not have thick hair, and I have a shaved head.  Can't say much about the face mask part of the hat as I never got that far with it.  I have already returned this useless piece of junk."
1.0,This is the worst outfit I bought completely dissatisfied for 30.00 not happy at all the picture was misleading
1.0,Is just gray and white
1.0,"Not at all like descriptions. Arrived looking tarnished, old, and cheap. My Grandaughter wanted this based on photo. It looked really fun and cute. Doubt it is sterling silver. Would not buy again or recommend. Yet the case it arrived in was very nice, as was the packaging."
1.0,"My husband (given as a anniversary gift) was very pleased with these earphones... at first! The first thing we had to do was replace the battery after only 1 month! Then last week, the whole earpiece disintegrated! VERY UNHAPPY! The headphones have been used less than a dozen times. I am researching Consumer Reports for the next pair. SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THESE... DON'T PURCHASE!"
1.0,So I’m not much of a negative review writer. The dress is nice but it came with no tags and it has an ink stain in the front. I wished I would have known I was buying a returned product to make an informed decision. Maybe I would had purchased either way but I feel this was deceiving from the seller. - I am disappointed with this purchase. I waited too long after received it as I was shopping ahead for spring. Needless to say I am disappointed 😔 Not happy.Not happy at all Amazon. 🤦🏽‍♀️
1.0,"DISAPPOINTED!!! This dress does not have the frayed seams as pictured, which is what I loved about the dress.  Nice fit, but I will be returing"
1.0,Garbage! Worn once and the elastic  is broken. He just grew into them and the return window is closed! Don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,"Unfinished neckline hem that flops outwards, cheap fabric… and arrived smelling like dirty laundry"
1.0,meant for someone with a big chest
1.0,Not what I expected.  Not flattering for a plus size lady.
1.0,"I have had this type of belt for a while now.  However, the new buckle is far bigger than the old one and sadly it is painful to wear.  Other than that the product is fine..just wish they did not get the bigger buckle."
1.0,Did not hold up very well I washed on gently cycle and did not dry at all and strings still came out all over it and fell apart did not last long at all was very sad
1.0,This jewelry looks nothing like the pictures .. Disappointed
1.0,"Zipper pocket was glued on, not sewn and fell off after second wash.  Now I just have a shirt with a glue square on the sleeve."
1.0,"Anklet is made for children, was too small on my ankle. I added an extension chain myself and found that the hook itself was broken and wouldn’t close when I went to put it on. Useless to me now, can’t even wear it."
1.0,Material is very thin & see through. Ordered largest size available.. 5'9 & 130 lbs.. slim figure & it was tiny. The color does not match the photo online at all! More of a dull gold yellow color.
1.0,poor quality... I
1.0,"Don't buy this watch if you lead an active lifestyle. The glass broke within a month, not sure what caused it, but it is super weak and brittle. It kept the time fine and looked great though."
1.0,Piece of trash. Never worked.
1.0,I didn’t like the way the image was printed. It felt stiff and heavy. Cute shirt but I returned it.
1.0,Product arrived ripped in the knee and was ridiculously small.
1.0,Fit at first but then they shrank. Washed in cold water when this happened. I never use warm or hot water when washing.
1.0,Very easy to scratching and not at all fog resistant
1.0,"Ordered an XL -- Fits more like a small/medium. Fabric is very clingy, and the fit is not relaxed as shown in the picture."
1.0,I even went a size bigger and the dress was still ridiculously too small
1.0,"This is something I'd find at the Dollar Store. The handles are wrinkly , I'm going to try and iron it with cloth over it to see if that helps.Maybe line it to get some weight on it. I don't want to send it back because of the carbon footprint for such a little thing, it's tinny."
1.0,Be very careful ordering from this Company. My first order for my twins the boys came correct size....the girls wasn't even the correct slipper..it was a baby shoe in pink 3 sizes to small. A 24 month instead of a 7 toddler size! I returned at Khol's before the deadline and reordered in this pair pink with turquoise...NOW...I am being charged for non return of product! Wrong And to make matters worst these are still small and I just kept even though kids only wore for 2 weeks. To tight an not worth the hassel!!!
1.0,The dress was ill fitting and the color was way off. I would not recommend this dress.
1.0,"After reading all the great reviews, I decided to purchase these gloves. Imagine my disappointment when I received them. They are most certainly not leather. It feels like cheap plastic manufactured to feel like leather. The lining is not shearling or even fleece. For the money, I expected higher quality. These are going back IMMEDIATELY!!! If I could give 0 star, that's what I would give it."
1.0,Way too much going on with these. My husband and I laughed hysterically trying to figure out where to put the franks and the beans. Still don't get it. So they sit in the drawer supporting nothing.
1.0,"I wanted to love this so bad, I tried to love it, but it is just the worst. It barely works, It wont turn on without the charger. I unfortunately had to return it."
1.0,These earrings are much larger than pictured. They cover my entire earlobe.  The back posts of the earrings are not very sturdy and bent rather easily.  It’s a shame because the earrings might actually be cute if they were smaller.
1.0,After paying for my own shipping this dress came defective. It's missing a loop needed to lace the dress up in the back. And I also have to pay my own shipping to return it...
1.0,"Attractive but has NO TEETH to grip hair, falls out.  Tried bending, adjusting, but USELESS."
1.0,"If you are looking for a 70&#34;s costume for Halloween I strongly suggest this outfit, other wise stay away. Its not esthetically flattering on any body and what is shown in the photo is not what you get in the delivery.<br /><br />The fabric is a heavy thick poly nylon and the pockets serve no use except to make your hips appear wider in the front."
1.0,"This product probably deserves more of a 3 star review however, the advertising is terribly misleading.<br />It's priced at twelve dollars but claims it has been reduced from a normal asking price of over $180.<br />This is an absolute lie, this watch can be found from other sellers for a normal price of $18. Even worse, this &#34;amazing&#34; deal was a featured deal of the day.<br />This is why alot of my friends refuse to buy clothes and accessories from amazon and tactics like this need to be stopped.<br /><br />As for the actual watch:<br />It's a good watch for the price. It's a little difficult to remove the extra links to size it. And I noticed that when some of the links are removed, it exposes some unpainted surface in between the links that hurts the look of the watch. This isn't extremely noticeable, but knowing it's there bothers me.<br /><br />Other than that I'm happy with the watch"
1.0,"Not sure if I received a defective pair, but the right lens is sort of frosted, so I can't see out of that eye. Don't have time to return. I did get a pair of silver mirrored ones that work and look good."
1.0,This ring is so weak. Does not hold it's shape. Bends EXTREMELY  easy.<br />Sent back!
1.0,"I've bought a lot of dress like this on Amazon and this is the worst by far. The material is nice, but the fit is not flattering, the dye on the fabric is not even, and the fabric has dents even when I use a high quality hanger."
1.0,Could be better made
1.0,The plastic wrapping was sloppily taped shut and there was a film of grease and fingerprints on the outside. So gross. Pissed that I can’t return it since I need a clear bag for an event.
1.0,Too small but I gave it to someone who could fit in it
1.0,"Item was to small, will be returning, but, it felt very comfortable, and the colors very flattering."
1.0,I bought 2 of these. The first one works perfect and is amazing. The second one stopped working after 4 days of use. Now my husband has a good working mask and mine doesn't work at all. Im not impressed 😕
1.0,"I bought this item for my wife and within 2 month's, the shoulder strap broke. It happened while we were walking downtown. This purse was not treated rough or thrown around, so why the shoulder strap came off, is beyond me. I'll admit, I don't have much experience with purses, but it seems it should last longer than 2 months."
1.0,Very light weight fabric.size not as stated.
1.0,Light illuminates AFTER you get zapped.
1.0,The dress didn’t fit well around the back/chest
1.0,I'm 161 and 5'10&#34; and wear a medium so that's what I ordered in this midweight sweatshirt. It fits like an extra large with a gigantic waist. I washed and dried it on high but it didn't shrink. I guess Russell Athletic Wear assumes everyone's a lard ass.
1.0,"one of the two Broke and lost on first leg of a trip- while the item looks well made and nice looking, the weak point is clearly the binder that attaches the tag to the luggage. It is basically a nylon rubber binder like ones girls use for ponytails, glued onto the tag. I already saw the potential of losing it and put it on the inside of a handle so as not to expose the tag to as much abuse.  I would not recommend."
1.0,"This infected my piercing after wearing it for less than a week. It also sits pretty weird so the head sticks out so far that if you were to wear a tight shirt, it would be extremely noticeable. Really unhappy with it because I love sharks and thought this would be cute for the summer."
1.0,They absorb your breath so they are always wet looking
1.0,Horrible waste of money. Didn’t even pretend to stay magnetized. Couldn’t use and mad I wasted my money!  Two thumbs down. Don’t even want to give one star
1.0,The straps have particles falling off them. It feels cheap and i regret buying this bag.
1.0,"While the hat was adorable and big enough to fit an adult as expected, it arrived smellling of strong mildew even though the package was plastic and completely sealed.  I can only think that it was packaged damp and had plenty of time in transit to build up a good funk.  It is not worth it to me to take the trouble return it, so I will try washing it in the sink and let it dry to see if I can get rid of the smell.  Too bad, because it is really cute and perfect for Disneyland."
1.0,The shirt was hemmed crooked so that the curved hem fell at the side.
1.0,"Too small for face. Covered mouth or nose, not both. Too bad, seemed like good quality"
1.0,Not for sensitive ears had my ears sore and painful not worn for even 2 hours
1.0,"Size runs small and the texture is thin, gauzy but scratchy."
1.0,"This company must not be aware what ""plus"" size is"
1.0,It doesn’t say Average Joes.  Don’t buy.<br />Average Toe with a poor attempt at an s at the end.
1.0,"Hard to fit in standard credit cards in the slots. Also, the height is more, so sliding in and out of the back pocket is hard."
1.0,"Not a real crystal, some of the glue ran down on the ""crystal"" metal is very weak, the chain is not easy to clasp as it seems cheaply made. Description says its a crystal however it is clearly plastic or resin. Do not recommend. Wish I could rate 0."
1.0,The bonnet is poor quality ripped with then 2weeks of me wearing it .
1.0,"This is the worst boot that I ever bought, the whole sole of the boot came off in less than a week. I threw away 40.00. Would never buy from this company again."
1.0,"It's a great pair of thigh highs but they aren't at all as pictured in the fact that they don't stretch hardly at all. If you're like 150lbs or less then these are the tights for you but anyone weighing anything more, forget about it. Unfortunately now i have to go buy another pair of tights for Halloween."
1.0,It was not a one piece suit
1.0,"Bag is nice, but came without pouch"
1.0,Horrible. All cards stick to it. Ripped a cuticle trying to get a card out of the slot.
1.0,"The shirt itself is very nice and soft.  The problem is the printing is peeled off in small areas, I'm concerned if I wear/wash it, it will continue to come off."
1.0,"Garbage, came broken and won't clasp. Not worth 1$"
1.0,THIS IS A LADIES SUIT...NOT A GIRLS!!! I put middle ground on fit cuz she never put it on! Fix your description!  I order from Amazon all the time and this one is a nightmare to understand.  Poor quality seller.
1.0,As soon as I put the band on my watch it fell apart. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The fabric isn't dyed. The print is stamped onto the fabric. So, it's white on the inside. If you're not a ""busty"" gal, the top of this dress is going to gap and hang loose off your top half. It's very low quality.  I returned it. And, no surprise - it's from China."
1.0,Broke on first wear.
1.0,I didn't expect it to be so big. Didn't really care for it.
1.0,It was supposed to be “new and used” the package was ripped and the watch band was so filthy it was disgusting!
1.0,Turns wrist Green
1.0,They need to work on there sizes
1.0,its a total waste of money. doesn't work. basically its a plasta for your finger to use under the ring...
1.0,Way too small for my husband so I gave it to my 11 year old son and he still has to open it to put it on. I also dont like that you cannot open the bracelet without the key.
1.0,"Got the package in the mail yesterday , and nothing was in it. Highly disappointed."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6661dbb05d09c8fb964bc964b94fb4d2]] That's all that was in the package. No glasses. Very disappointed.
1.0,Mala calidad se despintó al primer uso
1.0,It’s really long and it’s not a normal anklet it does not come as pictured and the string is extremely long and you can’t even fix it so not very happy with this purchase don’t buy it
1.0,worst product i have ever ordered from Amazon
1.0,But it should have worked more just a few hours. About 3 hours after I activated the  watch it stopped. And kept stopping. I even put in a new battery and it still stopped. I won't by again. Its now worth the effort to return it.
1.0,I really hoped this jacket would fit. It ran small and the arms were very long and tight. Loved the color but it was very wrinkled when I opened it. Returned.
1.0,Runs very very small. about 3 sizes.
1.0,Fits weird.
1.0,The skulls are tiny and hardly legible as skulls. The ring has pink all over it and should be black. I'm just disappointed. I wanted what I paid for.
1.0,Not at all what it looks like in the picture. I ordered a small and I’m a small/medium. It was huge and ugly. Returned immediately.
1.0,I bought it for a party and when it came it was poorly made and had drags where there should not be any. So disappointed.
1.0,Too small to hold much of anything.
1.0,Bought 2 of these sunglasses. Like the look and fit. Very poor quality. Both snapped in the middle after wearing them each for a week. Very disappointing.
1.0,Fits very strange and uncomfortable. Waste of money.
1.0,The dress shown has short sleeves the dress I received has NO sleeves. Cute but definatley not what I wanted!
1.0,Cheaply made and they smell like plastic. I feel nauseous wearing them because of the strong smell. They are not eligible for a return. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"No tiene costuras, el material es de baja calidad."
1.0,Quality appeared to be good but does not fit 42mm.
1.0,these glasses worked out just dine.
1.0,DIDNT come with batteries.
1.0,"Love the style; I thought the size would be perfect for my narrow thi's, but unfortunately not. Way two tight felt my leg and feet where going num."
1.0,Not very flattering. The bottom is oddly shaped & flares a bit. Not very satisfied & would not recommend.
1.0,"Cheap, it change color"
1.0,"When I did finally receive this item I was totally shocked and upset when I took it out of the shipping envelope. It was folded in a 3x3 package and was so tightly wrapped I almost cut the purse trying to get it out. It was so tightly wrapped that it now has permanent wrinkles in it. I know this is a very inexpensive bag but you expect more care when you open it. On the other hand,it does seem like it would have been a nice bag. Like the design on it a it seems well made. Unfortunately I would not recommend this purchase unless you don’t mind trying to get the wrinkles out. Company should take more care in the packaging of their items,no matter how inexpensive they are."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:d5e4b9a955ebb961da068867d7d4879]] Although the colors in this dress are absolutely gorgeous, the material is definitely not chiffon. It is a shiny cheap material almost like those Disney kids pajamas. Not what I was expecting, and super disappointed! As a grown woman, I could never wear this dress out in public. Might've been cute if i was toddler."
1.0,Supposed to be like a knit material but instead it’s a silky pencil skirt..
1.0,"OMG got the wrong size,my daughter is rather upset,she ordered large got small ,she bought this dress to wear for the weekend, a disappointment ,but good quality ,great fabric"
1.0,"Runs very small, also came smelling like toxic chemicals. It was so strong I didn't think it would come out in the wash"
1.0,I put this on and will not stay up. This is a bad idea.
1.0,I hate this
1.0,"I am an original backer for this product... It came late, which is usual for most crowd funded projects. It did finally arrive and I have to say it is nice not having to charge the watch. I haven't done so and it has been about a year(?) now. But be warned it isn't a ""smartwatch"". You cannot load apps to it. The connectivity with your phone is pretty much limited to getting notices for email and messages (you cannot view them) and updating your steps. I should have said when you are connected.<br /><br />This watch just doesn't stay connected. Others have written reviews on this problem so I won't go into details but suffice it to say, unless you continually want to have to reset and reconnect DO NOT BUY this watch.<br /><br />I'm quite sad. The concept was great and they put a lot of features in their new watch, but this one is a dud. Wish I could return it and get my money back. BTW I did save a $100 for being a backer so I'm only out $179... That is still a pretty big, ouch. For that amount I have gotten an Amazfit GTR which reportedly has very good battery life and save a couple of bucks, and gotten better functionality. Hindsight is always 20-20"
1.0,The watch is large enough for a boy. Not sure why it is listed as a woman's watch. The band is also too large for my wrist.
1.0,"Awful. Returned, does not meet details. Cheaply made and took forever shipping wise."
1.0,"I bought it.<br />The same day I tried putting it on, it tore"
1.0,Purchased these because we wanted COTTON soccer socks… which is what the seller indicated these were in the description.  As evidenced in this photo they are most certainly NOT COTTON. We’ve been duped!
1.0,Not what I expected can’t use them
1.0,WAY too big for the nose. Looks ridiculous
1.0,shoddy production  may be the reason tag was removed from collar  button holes are inferior threads break off with every hole  very low quality not worth the price  save your money  amazon should review their production arrangement
1.0,"They're pretty, but low quality. The hoop broke and all the pearls fell off the first time I took them off."
1.0,it arrived crushed in a flat envelope. the size to fit a young child unlike my other G.loomis hats. this is NOT something Gerry Loomis would approve of. I hope Shimano dose not start doing G.loomis rods this way or they need to put there own name on them.
1.0,"Cheap- poor quality. The second time I tried to put it on the zipper (made of plastic plastic) broke, then the actual pieces of the zipper broke off. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who wants a true &#34;slimmer.&#34; This is a Chinese joke."
1.0,Did not like ! Medium way to big
1.0,Absolutely no support. Very bad shape. I would have returned it if I did not wash it.
1.0,Wrong fit
1.0,Looked okay but broke after I put it on
1.0,"Fit well, bit the buttons fell off after use"
1.0,There’s a loud Distortion in the right hand speaker that is unbearable. Not to mention you can’t remove the speakers to wash the hat which is dumb.
1.0,These are not stainless steel earrings.
1.0,The arms weren’t right for a fat girl
1.0,"This is a long sleeve tshirt, no a sweatshirt. Very thin tshirt material. False advertising."
1.0,it turn black so it must not be real silver 925 it is stamped even NOT REAL
1.0,"I was hoping these would be smaller in size, they just didn’t work for me."
1.0,It was very cheaply made. Very thin. I returned for a refund.
1.0,Not recommend
1.0,Its see through.....
1.0,Tela de muy mala calidad . Totalmente transparente
1.0,Mine only came with 3.
1.0,The slippers were way to big and came totally stretched out. But very comfortable. Maybe I just got a lemon pair.
1.0,Terribly thin and all bent out of shape. No way you can smooth this out and I am unable to return. Buyer beware.
1.0,Wore it on and it was nothing like it was pictured and the fabric is really thin
1.0,Shrunk to a size 1T
1.0,"Poor quality, definitely would not purchase again."
1.0,"I realize this was a $20 watch, but I never even had a chance to wear it. That is not BRIGADA'S fault, what is their fault is poor quality. Purchased this watch to wear at a wedding, but forgot it at home. Six months later I'm getting ready for another wedding, check the watch and the battery is dead. So I pop the back replace the battery and the hands just flop around....watch no longer works. This is not my 1st watch battery change, just my 1st in a cheap one. My advice to BRIGADA is,use a better quality battery and your reviews will be better, since customers won't have to mess with it.You get what you pay for!!!"
1.0,"Considering this was pewter, this product was very cheap very lightweight. It reminded me of something you would give out to a third grader as a prize. Extremely disappointed would never buy this again."
1.0,The are way to small and don’t wash
1.0,"Really pretty dress, however, this fit sooo small on my bust area :("
1.0,The sweatshirt was too small for my adult son.  We ordered (what we thought was an adult size sweatshirt) it looked more like a child size.  Not happy with this purchase.
1.0,The real color is pink not red like on the picture and is smaller
1.0,Less than 2 months and the charger port broke.
1.0,this was a cool idea and i loved the bottle opener but after about opening 15 bottles the plastic that holds the metal opener will crack.  also the opener kind of hits your ear when you wear these and feels weird.  there needs to be a removeable cover on the openers to be worn more comfortably.  if the product was more durable i would give it 5 stars cause they are cool.
1.0,My grandson won’t get until Christmas so I won’t know until then
1.0,These are not those super tights that you can cut a melon through... these are more like those ultra fragile tights that mecome a mess of Halloween decor as you remove them from the packaging. Complete rubbish!
1.0,Glasses arrived scratched
1.0,The stones are so small you can't even see the color.
1.0,"I ordered one and it arrived smelling horrible.  I contaminated my washer, dryer, other clothes, and all throughout my house with an awful chemical smell!!  I asked for an exchange - the new one was in the same condition.  I am still unable to remove the smell from everything.  I wish I could be compensated some how.  My son loved the jacket itself, it fit perfect and looked great- just need a gas mask to own it! I would not recommend anyone to buy this jacket."
1.0,Shirt came with a hole in the arm sleeve. I'm so disappointed right now. This was a Christmas present and it's too late to get another in time.
1.0,Huge and cheap material.
1.0,"This was completely a mess... The cloth was very cheap,  looks like my 8 year old sew it... It was terrible..."
1.0,"Good: Very logical pocket structure, looks nice<br /><br />Bad: Arrived with a minor but annoying zipper issue, Very flimsy, after 1.5 months of use both of the handles have fallen off and one of the sling attachments has burst. (only packed recommended amount)<br /><br />Overall: Hugely disappointed in this bag's performance. It may be suitable for extremely light travel"
1.0,Horrid! I put it on and my husband just laughed. It’s like wearing a heavy tent.
1.0,I hate it.  It has thick seams along the front that show through in even pretty thick tops.
1.0,Fit perfectly and then shrank after first wash.  Washed in cold water and dried on delicate temerature.
1.0,Def not plus size!!!!!!!!
1.0,"Absolute crap. Looks nothing like the photos at all. They are not shiny and are scuffed up and just poorly put together. Very, very disappointed. Sending them back!"
1.0,Cheap. May light for a second but not long enough to use.
1.0,Chinese sizes. 2X Chinese is med-large in the U.S.
1.0,"Tried using these to keep groceries cold/warm, but the zipper on 1 bag broke completely off the bag on the 2nd use, and the pull tab on the other zipper broke off the next day!! Very disappointed with the quality, as they were much thinner than expected!"
1.0,"I hate it.  Really hate it.  I can't believe trash like this is even sold.  Actually, I can't believe I bought it after all the horrible reviews.  I think I just wanted a soft, yellow sweater.  Well, this sweater, or rag as I would call it, is yellow and soft.  That's all it is that is good.  I ordered a 3x because I read it runs small, which it does, but even that didn't fit and I am usually an XL.  But the size of this product isn't the worst part.  It is sewn all crooked.  The stitching on the unusually short sleeves is so off that the cuffs are off-set.  The hem is off center and I can't even straighten it out so that it lies flat.  If I try the side seems are off.  I have nothing good to say about this product and I am wondering what those people who gave it 4 or 5 stars received because it wasn't what I did.  Worst part is I can't send it back.  And I can't give it to charity because I won't be mean to poor people."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:507aca9dc7c0dc06502fd9c86649c63e]] Bag only worked one day before tearing. Had one binder and a couple of the lil marble notebooks for 7th grade. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Several weeks ago I ordered (2) Rolf's replacement ""D"" credit card windows. I was sent a much cheaper version sold by Buxton which was the wrong design, too large to fit my Rolf's wallet and not what I ordered.  When I requested the specific items I ordered, I was informed that MENSWALLET no longer carried the Rolf's version which they advertised on AMAZON and they would take the product off AMAZON.  They refunded my expenses but I really wanted the ""D"" replacement windows.  I can only believe what MENSWALLET communicated  to me:  that they do not carry the authentic Rolf's product."
1.0,"It stopped working properly in less than 2 months.  No heat comes out now, just blows cold air.  And the cold air blows out as if its set on low.  Terrible product"
1.0,Worthless.  My son took them snowboarding last year.  The lining comes out when you take off the gloves making virtually impossible to put them back on. Too bad it's too late to return them.
1.0,I was going to give this as a present will definitely not do it
1.0,Was to little
1.0,No se parece en nada a la de la foto wstan un poco raro y nada lindas
1.0,the picture on amazon looks NOTHING like what it does when i received it. i’m really upset i waited over a month for this just to go return it. do not buy. see picture
1.0,"Way too small, they they can hardly stretch over the heel.  They would be ok for a an 8 year old."
1.0,This outfit was very cute however one wash and the pants were shredded. They literally fell apart in the washing machine. So we got a shirt out of it that's it. Kind of sad because it was so cute.
1.0,I do like the RING I got but these were advertised and ordered as earrings. I expected earrings. The ring is exactly the same design but I didnt want a ring.
1.0,Using this purse is an outright ad for Calvin Klein.
1.0,the buttons jiggle too much and seem very flimsy.
1.0,These run very small.  After initial wash they shrunk even more.  Recommend buying two sizes larger.
1.0,Wish list junk
1.0,"i received an empty package, i am very upset. i paid for this product and was highly surprised when i opened it up to find an empty package."
1.0,Does not stay shut was very disappointed in this item may have to send it back
1.0,broke within one day
1.0,It was a beautiful design but very delicate. It came damaged (one piece was broken off). Also very very hard to put on. It was very hard lining up the holes through the ear.
1.0,"I do like these earrings even though they are a bit big.  Unfortunately I don't believe they are pure silver. They came tarnished and they won't come clean.  The posts appear to be silver, but the earring not do much... Very sad.."
1.0,"I really love this, but I wore in a few hours, mostly sitting and it broke. Very Sad"
1.0,To heavy and surprisingly too big for my wrist. Swings around and just not what I thought.
1.0,The stone (which looked more like glass than moonstone) fell out the first day!
1.0,"It's a pretty wallet, but it has a strong chemical smell. It also isn't functional for all the cards it says it can hold. It won't close if full & it bends in a weird way. Great idea, bad execution."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8d1fd0977cfca10b4181522b34ab5fee]] very tight not true to size very disappointed
1.0,"You definitely get what you pay for here. Cheap material, not a swing dress more of a wide straight skirt. Material and cut DO NOT match the picture! I didn't even bother trying this on it is just terribly made."
1.0,Not what I expected....cheap fabric. Cannot wear it.
1.0,I ordered and it took weeks to get it. I ordered a 2x and at best it same as a Large. Material wasnt at all what I expected. I sent my shirt back. Even at the low price not worth it.
1.0,SO UGLY. Not even close to what is pictured here. Do not order this!!
1.0,"I am between a small and medium. I ordered a small and it was too tight.  I returned and ordered a medium and it fit exactly the same as the small. Returning, very disappointed."
1.0,Device was piece of junk that didnt even work.  DOA
1.0,These are super itchy and cheap.
1.0,"Thing is trash with be broken very quickly, not durable at all please don’t waste your money on any of these heirlooms!!!!!"
1.0,I have not seen leather like this one :(
1.0,"Nice item, but ran very small."
1.0,These are not transitioning lenses. Just clear plastic. Maybe I was just sent the wrong lenses but these are definitely not transitioning lenses.
1.0,Not as expected.  Shipping took a long time. Material was cheap and stained when I got it.
1.0,This dress was re-tagged n already altered . The bottom was crocked n the dazzle all came off. Had to be hot glued on. The loops were missing n the string to tie up was cut by the previous owned! Very upset!!
1.0,The zipper for the folding pocket portion broke after just one use. The rest of the bag seems decent though.
1.0,"I thought i purchased a bag but i only received a cover. 🤣 for a cover though, $50+ is ridiculously expensive. I am at lost. 🤣😂"
1.0,Not very user friendly. Really hard to store hats in thos item. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,"Necklace arrived already broken in several places. Don't waste your money, this is a complete piece of junk. I'm insulted that anybody would try to sell this."
1.0,Don't waste your money. lost little sparkles and silver is wearing odd. Sorry pass on this one.
1.0,sole comes lose after only a short time of use
1.0,Waistband too hard and thick. Hardly any stretch. Unable to use. No comfort in these sweats.
1.0,Seriously couldn't breathe in it was super cute but u can't breathe
1.0,"Not good at all looks old and tarnished, returning ASAP."
1.0,Has a little  tear at the edge.
1.0,This dress came way too big...I ordered it large because the reviews said it ran small but that's a lie. And it looks NOTHING like the picture at all. It has a small pouch on one side that looks cheap an awkward so I just wear it as a night gown to sleep in since I'd never wear this public.
1.0,Some of them not okay
1.0,Turned my foot orange after a day and the blue bracelet faded to white in two days
1.0,"not the quality or sizing expected, no button on the fly and the elastic in the waistband is folding over and the material is paper thin, you can see through the material.<br />i am returning these for a refund.<br />usually purchase merona knit boxers from target, but they are almost non-existant anymore."
1.0,They didn’t fit my frames
1.0,Earrings Purchased<br />It was smaller than I anticipated
1.0,Too small they hurt
1.0,Not a fan of this gown's structure. It's awkward to use and adds nothing over a regular gown. I wouldn't buy a kimono gown again.
1.0,Cheap looking and not long enough
1.0,Ordered a BSWolf Fiber Slim and got a Tougher Gun fiber slim wallet. And it didn’t come with the bonus money clip.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d649dd4066160605aa7ebd0e43490155]] Disappointed
1.0,I was able to return it
1.0,This product is for my grandson and this is a reorder.  I returned the first one since it was mis-sewn and also the conductor patch was sewn way off senter.  The 2nd one received was just as smashed up and the sewing job was very poor quality making the shape of it very differently than the picture that is advertised on the Amazon website.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Terrible product. Literally ripped the seat out of the pants on the first day I wore them. Do not buy.
1.0,to small doesnt fit to size. horrible material. and poor quality design.fuzzy image.
1.0,"No es muy cómoda ya que la camiseta es muy pequeña, yo solicite Talla M<br />Pantalón perfecto pero la camiseta es una larga XS a pesar que dice en la etiqueta talla M"
1.0,"The material is very cheap, like someone else had mentioned it’s similar to a swimsuit. Judging by the pictures I was expecting more of a linen type material. The size is also larger than expected. I’m 5’9 and 130lbs and ordered a small; the mid section of this was not form fitting at all. The belt arrives detached but even with it, the outfit looks frumpy in the middle. Very disappointed."
1.0,Not worth it at all...
1.0,I opened this shirt when I got the package today and it's nothing like I expected the picture makes it look alot nicer I had 2 other colors picked out glad I didnt get 3 I'm pretty disappointed in the shirt
1.0,pants rip easily not meant for yoga or the gym<br /><br />The grey pair ripped in the crotch area and I wore them to the gym not knowing and the black pair are SEE THRU<br /><br />I have been doing yoga and not aware the entire time you could see my skin tone and panties underneath<br /><br />The material is great and the fit awesome but they are not for bending or showing your bottom. Must wear a long shirt to cover
1.0,Color of chain
1.0,Horrible quality. Seams came apart after 2 hours of wear!!!
1.0,"On the left side of the boxer briefs, 2 of the 4 teared at the seam. They didn't even last a full day."
1.0,"They are horrible quality, ripped my daughters ears open."
1.0,Not that great .
1.0,"To long ,not big but to long."
1.0,Ordered up to have the baggy look which was perfect until I washed it....shrunk and now way too short on me. Very disappointed!
1.0,Too small after washing once the shirt was like a crop top on my son
1.0,I really wanted to like it because I like the button down baby doll shirts!<br />This one has the trim piece under the breasts and it just looks silly! It looks like a child shirt. It doesn’t look right at all. I did get the plain solid white which looks so cute and you can dress it up. I also have the black button down and that looks awesome as well. These with the trim are more tightly woven and look cheaper and for a child.<br />Oh and I got an XL in all and they fit perfectly on a 42DDD top and I’m 195 right now at 5’5”.
1.0,"These socks were comfortable the first few times I wore them, but they wore out way too fast.  Within 2 months all of them had holes in the toes.  On the whole I would say that they were not worth the price I paid.  Next time I'll get something different."
1.0,DIDN'T like it.
1.0,The description is awful.  They are knit not like real compression stockings.  Beware do NOT purchase they will not refund you.
1.0,Cause my fitbit to fall off....lost forever! So expensive purchase.
1.0,Hard to evaluate a product that was DOA out of the box.
1.0,"Says it’s a 2 pack, only received one.  Very thin material, and not in the good wicking kind of way.  Fits very strangely.  Been better off cutting sleeves off any old t shirt."
1.0,Based on reviews I ordered the shirt two sizes too big. It still was too small. Do not buy. Bad quality and poorly made.
1.0,These gloves tore along a seam after less than two months use.
1.0,"It isnt soft, too hard, looks like cheap plastic."
1.0,Leopard print is almost blurry. Very cheap looking. Will return!
1.0,Sad to say does not look like the picture  these are for girls they look gray on guys
1.0,"This color was completely different from the black one.  It ran smaller,  and the material felt different.  I returned it."
1.0,Smaller than it looks. Cheap quality
1.0,"Instructions do not match the watch (button functions wrong) and was unable to turn hourly chimes or alarm off.  Even though under $20, it still isn't worth it."
1.0,This item was too small and too short.  Returned
1.0,Way too big for the child’s mouth.
1.0,Not even wearable. Runs big
1.0,"Cute dress, but obviously NOT new. It arrived with chewing gum on the sleeve! Nobody in my house chews gum!"

1.0,HOT GARBAGE MADE POORLY NO GG SIGN HANDLES TARNISHED LOW QUALITY DUP KEEP SCROLLING OR GET SCREWED
1.0,Cheap product that falls apart after the first time you hand wash it The mask is not TSA approved
1.0,"This looked really nice and more expensive that it was, and my wife was initially very happy with it.  However, after just a few short months of occasional use, the handles began to crack and they now look awful.  This is made from cheap materials--don't waste your money."
1.0,why would you mail me a dirty shirt !  nasty !
1.0,The material of this shirt is like sandpaper. It is NOT chambray.
1.0,item description a lie not XL don't waste your money if you have a nice wife with an ass that is fit not a true XL ass described
1.0,The item I received was not as pictured and the wrong size.
1.0,"The band fell apart, so I returned it.  One of the screws came loose, otherwise it looked nice while it worked.  In addition, I purchased the same type of watch in brown and the wood cracked so I won't purchase any more of this type."
1.0,Terrible product. Scam!!
1.0,It was way too tight and arrived super late.
1.0,I was very disappointed in this product. While The quality was fine the patterning was nothing like what was pictured online. It is almost impossible to tell it was a leopard pattern as the background was so dark Iand the spots were barely barely visible. If you are looking for something like what is pictured this is not the product!
1.0,Not at all what is pictured
1.0,Missing some stones
1.0,The little astronaut fell off after wearing it 1 time.  Can not find it to put it back on.
1.0,"Cheap material, cheaply made<br />fit is terrible, look and feels like a<br />Halloween  costume"
1.0,"The belt looks nice for about a month, then starts cracking and stretching. I am very thin, and I figured the other reviews claiming bad longevity were people with guts, but wow I will never buy another product from this company again."
1.0,Did not fit size way off very disappointed
1.0,"I was so excited when I got this watch it looked just like the picture. However I wore it for a short time and the clasp popped open. I was going to get a new band for it, but the clasp popped open and it was lost before I could. Only buy this if you have a new band to put on it right away"
1.0,But the colour not as same as in the photo
1.0,These are very transparent for sunglasses. Essentially they are blue tinted lenses. Returning for a pair to actually shade my eyes from the sun
1.0,"Do not order this product. The sizes run extremely small. I attempted to order these a bit big for comfort and could barely get them on. If you're normally a 3 or 4x you should order these in like a 6x, no joke . Atleast with a 6x you may have a chance of these up pat your behind. Not worth it."
1.0,This slip is nothing as described. It says it has one hoop at the bottom. It's a full hoop skirt. It has three hoops. And it isn't long enough. I am 5'4&#34; and it fits me about tea length. I am really upset. Also can't even hook the Velcro top because it is sooo small. Shipping took so long and it's not even as described or pictured. There is no way I could even make this work with my dress. It is very cheap too. Not worth the money.
1.0,I was not satisfied with quality
1.0,The hat is real cute my daughter loved it but the wires to the on/off device became detached after the first time wearing it.
1.0,Huge split right down the middle. Thick foam. Awful. Can't return either!
1.0,These bags was Terrible I brought them for a trip to Germany. I used the largest and the smallest bag .By the time I arrived in Germany the largest of the bags had already lost 2 wheels  and that was before I even left the airport . therefore I had to throw the bag away and buy an € 85 for another bag just to bring my stuff back.<br />The smallest bag lost 2 wheels by the time I reached my return flight
1.0,My daughter told me one of the shoes didn't light up!
1.0,"Item came used.<br />I mean really, what the hell?"
1.0,One of the black stones already fell off before I even took it out of the package. Such a disappointment.... I was really looking forward to this ring. Will be returning .
1.0,Opening them out of a brand new box I didn’t expect for there to be string shedding everywhere first thing and the silver hardware was totally tarnished and gross. I would not recommend these for this price or just in general.
1.0,"Way Way To Small. I had my tennis playing in shape 14 year old try it on.. Fit nicely. Not going to work for a 58 year old no in shape kind of guy.  When I shared this with the company, their response was; ""It is recommended to refer to the size information sheet before placing an order. IF you are not sure about the size, it is recommended to use a larger number of yards. Best Blessings. "" WHAT?? Besides, there isn't a size information tag on the item in the order<br /><br />Other then that, the shirt looks pretty cool."
1.0,Looked really great in the picture and honestly for the price I guess I can't really complain. When it arrived it was all tangled up and the silver color just looked very cheap. The actual chain isn't very dainty either you can clearly see the rings.
1.0,Smaller than described
1.0,"These were way too small. I couldn't even get my leg in them. I didn't have a chance to return them in time because of covid. I'm a single mom and have 2 very young children, so I don't like to take them out in public. So now I have 2 pairs that I cannot fit, and list out on almost $40.  :("
1.0,This fits huge in some areas and tight in others. Very cheap material.
1.0,"I’m 5”2 and weigh 135.  I won’t even post a picture to show how Ridiculously tight the pants are , the top seems to be pretty accurate but these pants could fit my 9 year old daughter .weird lines run all through the pants and the pattern is slightly different not in a good way ! I was looking forward to treating myself to a new active wear outfit  since reaching my first goal in my weight loss journey but I’m Very disappointed . Hope the returning process isn’t too difficult"
1.0,"This dress was nothing like the picture.  It was much longer and the picture.  That I could deal with but the bodice was not fully lined as shown.  The only lining was a strip of thin black fabric tacked by two corners over the bust, only in the front.  Also the zipper in the back was poorly sewn in causing the pleats to bunch.  Overall it was like it was from the Wednesday Addams collection."
1.0,"I'm a dress size 0 and ordered a small, this did not fit and felt and looked cheap."
1.0,"I wore this once, and the next time I pull it out to wear, it broke in my hand. The metal loop just crumbled. Too bad it was cute and would have been nice with the dress."
1.0,Too small otherwise would have been fine.
1.0,The bowtie broke the very first time we tried it on. The tail is way too short. The ears were fine. This was a total waste of money and now I have to buy something else. Very frustrated.
1.0,The swimsuit is beautiful but it runs very small. Don't go by the size chart. It is entirely wrong.
1.0,Not what I expected. I ordered thinking they could be tongue ring retainers but they don't work too small.
1.0,The XL is not 48 chest size it’s 42 the description of size not accurate I use under motorcycle jacket they waste my time and money
1.0,"I purchased this in hopes of helping my child who has autism. While opening, I noticed immediately that the packaging was damaged, which was no big deal, until I realized that the seams were frayed as well. I'm afraid it may come unraveled in the wash. For nearly $20 a shirt, I'm already disappointed, and my child hasn't even tried it on yet."
1.0,"Can't wear these under any pants.  I unrolled, looked at edge, big thick seam and knew right away they would show.  Returned immediately."
1.0,Shoulder strap is broken after 2 weeks. Very cheaply made
1.0,Returned this because it was so hard to see the engraving.
1.0,"I love shwings, but these are too neon.  Way too neon."
1.0,Looks cheap :(
1.0,"I made sure, I chose a size that would fit me, according to the size chart and peoples reviews.  I normally wear a large, so I got the 3XL, and still it was way too small.  I ended up giving it away to my friend that is 5'2 120lbs."
1.0,very disappointed in the quality or lack of in this product.
1.0,no ta bad shoe but at least 2 sizes too large. my sone wears 11.5-12 in little kids and this is EASILY a 13. should have gotten a full size down (10.5-11)
1.0,Cute but turned green in a day
1.0,Trying to return. Way too small. It is not sized correctly.
1.0,"I bought these gloves for winter because my hands are always freezing!!! I tried them on in a department store and loved them but thought $35 was too expensive. Purchased these and I’m so disappointed. When you take your hands out the inside lining pulls out and it’s difficult to make the lining. Not warm, cheap. Broke down and purchased an authentic pair and absolutely love them!!! Don’t waste your money on these fake ones!!!"
1.0,"Alright - I ordered a 1X thinking it would fit but it only fits my size M 18 year old! Also, it showed up with one of the arms un-stitched. This is a total POS, RUN!"
1.0,Don’t buy this product. Cheap feeling
1.0,Beautiful looking watch.  The winding mechanism broke within one week of daily use.  I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVED it.  This morning he wound it up and we could hear the spring go.  He feels horrible.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Size chart is way off. It says to size up one size, but that is so incorrect. I’m an XL in everything I buy at stores, so I bought the XXL as upsize suggested and it fit like a small. This item shouldn’t be sold on Amazon because it’s so misleading. Extreme waste of my time to now go through the return process for misleading selling tactics for this company. Please move on and pick a different vest from another manufacturer. Too many good companies out there so don’t waste your time with this vest! Trust me, I’m saving you buyers remorse."
1.0,"I like the ring fine, problem is it came in a size six not nine and I could not give it as the gift I intended!"
1.0,Too big which makes it way too close to my eyes
1.0,would not reccomened this product keep shopping and spend a few more dollars. have agood dau and i am trying to waste words
1.0,It would only fit a doll!
1.0,Runs small and made cheap!
1.0,"I purchased these Loki bracelets for my daughters birthday.  Two of them immediately broke just when she was sliding them over her wrist.  I'd like my money back, and wouldn't advise anyone else to buy this product."
1.0,Don't buy this it strips and it looks so cheap.The material is pleather and it started striping in a month or so.
1.0,"It’s got a hole in the back (similar to a baseball hat) that’s not shown in pics. I guess it makes it adjustable, but if you have short hair or are bald, it is no good for keeping the sun off.<br />Incredibly poor design."
1.0,Horrible quality. Ordered two sizes larger than normal and it was tight:
1.0,Nothing wasnin the package.  Complete empty.
1.0,"too small, cheap thin material and doesn't flow like pic"
1.0,Not nearly as long or baggy as in picture
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture! Hugh disappointment!
1.0,"When looking at the picture, I assumed this would be the perfect wings for my costume. Well once I received them i realized that the front side is just white cardboard, no gold at all. the side where It would be seen in photographs is white. I cant even use them for my costume without it looking weird, im so disappointed. i spent $30 on this."
1.0,"A L Looks like q kids size medium, very cheap fabric, not as long as picture either, litteraly it fit my little cousin perfectly who very very skinny and it was a Large."
1.0,FITS weird
1.0,Rose Gold paint comes off fast!
1.0,Made of some strange synthetic fabric that looks and feels plastic. The shirt doesn’t appear acid washed or bleached. It’s just cheap.
1.0,I like the color and butterflies on it...my least favorite was it was size 5x but when I opened the package it looked like a size 2x and there wasn't any stretch to it...
1.0,Doesn’t hold up as well as it’s price tag would suggest.
1.0,Didn't like the quality at all..
1.0,Today is about my 4th or 5th day wearing the ring.  Sat down at the computer this morning and noticed the turquoise gem is gone.
1.0,These things just don't work. They slip off. Ive tried every brand. It is what it is.
1.0,This is not an elegant dress at all. It is one long spandex dress. I was so existed for it to come in and so heart broken in the material. So cheap.
1.0,These earrings are miniature. Nothing like the seller's picture.
1.0,"Normally I wear a Medium, but when not sure, I order Large.  I did order Large but I think the waist here measures about 20 inches around.  I can't even try them on.  I am returning them."
1.0,I didn’t wear this at all and wanted to wash it before i wore it. The red part bled on the white and now it’s ruined.
1.0,Ring sizer
1.0,The analog hand for the seconds is loose and it even counts backwards
1.0,"I am done with jewelry from Amazon.<br />The lengths are wonky (doesn't lay right), color off, cheap hardware and all around poor looking necklace. Direct from China."
1.0,"The earrings look cheap ,the color is almost white, never again."
1.0,Arrived defective was not packed with care
1.0,thought they will be of a decent quality but unfortunately not even close to oakley original. You should Never mislead customers by writing oakley in product description
1.0,The hat is NOT as the one pictured. You can not make out what the front of the hat is just two binocular circles. RIP OFF.
1.0,I sent this back very very upset with this product it didn’t even say what it was supposed to do not order this
1.0,"Terrible front hooks. The bottom hook always scratches me raw. I HATE this new style. They should not have stopped making the back hook design #6040. I'm just guessing but I'll bet it's a man who thought of this front hook design, so he can look you in the eyes. So now we've gone from 2 to 3 hooks in back, to 6 or 7 hooks in front. SMDH. I just don't get it!!!!!"
1.0,The size is a petite small and I ordered plus size
1.0,"I returned these; the stone that was set was not good quality, the black lines you see in the image were much more pronounced, so much so that they looked like cracks. Very disappointing considering that I was really happy with the other two pairs of yin-yang earrings I got from this seller."
1.0,I loved the colors but the metal on the band fell off right away and I can't fix it. The metal part won't fit. Please replace.
1.0,Please dont waste your money these rings look like they came out of the bubble gum machine. Well what do expect for such a cheap price. If you are looking for a play toy or for decorating this is it. This set is definitely not for grown woman everyday wear.
1.0,Package was empty .
1.0,Very cheaply made. Not worth buying.
1.0,Color is not as advertised. Completely purple instead of a gradient of multiple colors. Will<br />Keep and give to a friend that loves purple. Purple is the color that least goes with my skin tone or else i would keep for myself.
1.0,Bands are not durable! Only 1 week of use and already is broken!
1.0,These shorts would be amazing but they run like pantyhose from the seams in the crotch area. I was really bummed because other than that these are great shorts
1.0,I’m very disappointed bad quality<br />I was so excited
1.0,"NOT ASTM Level 3 as described! False advertising!! Paper thin, probably not even a level 1!"
1.0,Pretty cheap - ball is bigger than expected
1.0,This band will not fit the Apple Watch series 4 or a series 5 watch.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed
1.0,"If you like chunky looking shoes, these are for you."
1.0,"Battery was dead on arrival. When I replaced battery and hands moved, there’s two lines on the glass  now where they rested before, as enough dust gathered inside before."
1.0,Poorly made with cheap material. Sent it back immediately.
1.0,This was just bad. The 'rose gold' was already changing colour when I got the earrings and the crystals (no way are there any diamonds here) look dull and crappy. This was supposed to be a gift but I couldn't possibly give this to someone. Truly a waste of money.
1.0,"I really try to find something good about something,  but this is my 2nd watch and the same thing. The Bezel & watch face is scuff, scratched as is the Band. It seems to me like it's been worn/used.<br />Very disappointed because it's the 2nd one in 3 days.<br />It's a nice looking watch. but it looks like I mixed cement by hand with it.<br /><br />As the saying always go<br /><br />""You Get What You Pay For ""<br /><br />Because of this issue I give it Thumbs down 👎"
1.0,Concept is great but they just don't work
1.0,"I thought these bands were great.  Seemed to be of good quality and everything.  My son wore it to school the first day and it ripped the first day at school.  I didn't expect that cheap of quality from this product.  They seemed to be made better than that, but obviously not!"
1.0,"I don't know why it makes me pick a fit; I haven't opened any - I ordered 17 - because I don't know what to do.  I ordered brown and white striped socks.  These are for a soccer team dressing up as Oompa Loompas for a Halloween tournament.  If you squint and are in the right light, they look a little bit brownish, but by all reasonable accounts these are black and white and not at all Ooompa Looma-ish.  I was already taking liberties getting horizontal stripes instead of vertical.  Now I have $140 worth of socks that I don't know what to do with."
1.0,Way to long and fit like a one xlarge
1.0,Fits way too small. I am 5 foot 5 and the length hits right below my butt. Way too short!
1.0,Color starting to fade and my son doesn’t even wear it every day.
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,"Product is super cute but the ball does not screw into the flexible bar just pops on and pops off. Needless to say, I have had it less than 20 mins and it’s already fell off. Definitely a waste of money. I’m very disappointed in this product because I was excited to get it. Maybe I’ll buy a flexible bar elsewhere that doesn’t have this problem 🙄🙄"
1.0,"Band broke right away & pis kept popping out, even when I replaced them.  I threw the junk away!<br />I should have requested my money back, but it is in the landfill now!"
1.0,"If I could give no stars I would. I ordered this product in a size large, when it arrived I was sent a small. I ordered again believing it was a mistake and was sent another size small. This listing is a scam."
1.0,"The color is not even close to what is seen in the picture. I ordered the dark purple and it is a tacky, ugly purple in reality. It also has this ugly bunching on the sleeves. It's not a great dress"
1.0,Was not a man's size.
1.0,"The dress I got was not the one pictured. The neckline was up by my collar bone, no tags in the dress to see if it was the right size they shipped. Also the one I got has some sort of line, vertical from the collar line to my ribs. Its soft, I will give it that, but a totally different style and way too big! Said its ""true to size"" I ordered a large and its huge. I am 5'4"" 160lbs."
1.0,"This is a flat paper mask, not at all what we expected"
1.0,"Bought 2X, size chart says 38-41 inches Actual measurements 30 inch’s. Meant for a Christmas party not going to re-order because it will not be here in time. Oh wait second look and there are two size charts! Ugg"
1.0,"Would have been great if I got the headband with ears on it also! It was supposed to be in there, but was not."
1.0,"broke within 1 week, horrible"
1.0,It should be listed somewhere that this comes from China
1.0,They are way too small and they keep falling off from my feet after washing it once
1.0,"Just got this today & was so excited! But when I opened it up & looked at the band, I noticed the clasp is upside down...see pics. What. The. Heck??!! So now I can't use it & will have to return it. Bummed."
1.0,Fit nice when first tried on and then morphed into a baggy stretchy mess. If I had known I would have returned them before I wore them.
1.0,"Personally i don't like it, its really very very oversized. You can not judge this / such product online. Better way go to store & purchase sunglasses best fit for you or you have to pay return shipping charges."
1.0,One wash and the shoulder seam came apart
1.0,The seams in this sock were so uncomfortable I couldn't use it. Sent them back immediately. Very stiff and rough seams. The fitment was as expected but doesn't do much if they can't be worn comfortably.
1.0,"Calling this a ""hiking backpack"" is false advertising. What you are getting, here, is a small, packable, reusable backpack shaped bag. There is virtually no padding in the shoulder straps, and even cinched all the way down, they did not sit comfortably on my shoulders. When on my back, you (hopefully) can see that the straps twisted so they did not lay flat. The material is nylon like what you might find in a parachute, and as such does not breathe at all, meaning you'd quickly get hot and sweaty wearing this on the trail. Yes, this rolls up into a ""stuff sack"" meaning that you could carry this with you while out just in case you needed an extra bag, but this does not pack up small enough so that you'd want this while out hiking as a day pack. So, basically what you are getting is a reusable shopping bag that is ""backpack"" like. I would never use this out hiking, or even to carry thing out and about when I just needed a bag. There are way better options out there, so give this one a pass."
1.0,It broke within a month.
1.0,"Not what i expected.. only heats the shoe.. would take days to actually dry them.. was not impressed, have since returned this item."
1.0,Do not slide/way too small
1.0,This looked terrible on me. Very see through (which i expected) but the size of the top was not flattering at all. Way too big and i ordered my typical size small. I'm a 2-4 on average and 5'3 115 lbs.
1.0,"I thought the dress looked cute in the picture and the price was right.  The fabric for the sleeves on the dress have only been cut, not ironed and sewn with a seam.  Definitely returning."
1.0,Honestly the print is terrible and way oversized.  Wish I didn’t buy it.  Totally sucks.
1.0,Back fell off and I lost one in less than having them a week.
1.0,I was using this for a costume when I went to unzip it to wear it the zipper busted. I hadn't even tried it on yet. I pinned it closed you wear a sweater over before I got to work all the buttons had come off. So disappointed.
1.0,"The watch does not keep time. It has not kept time since it was purchased and given as a gift. So, the actual cost of this watch is the price listed plus the price to get it fixed, if that is worth it to you."
1.0,I'm pretty mad about this because I only got the black and the silver rings but I paid for all three. I was looking forward to wearing the gold one and I didn't even receive it. Huge let down.
1.0,"This was much smaller than I thought it would be, it is pointless for what I needed it for and it is very cheaply made. Every single zipper was closed, but broken & split so I had to fix it. The material is cheap and will not hold up to being used to hold school books and tablets. Definitely not worth your hassle!"
1.0,Pajamas were too large but it was less expensive to have them altered than to pay the restocking fee for an exchange.
1.0,"I disliked that the earrings have color only on one side, the other side is WHITE! This is why I gave it one star. That and the fact that the painting of the letters ran and bleed slightly. I kept these earrings only because I will be painting the inside of them myself and I just got locs, so it’s kinda cute."
1.0,Cheap crap and tiny. Gave it to my 6 yr old.
1.0,The cut itself wasn't as per the picture. The material wasn't very good.
1.0,"This is too funny and you can tell the designer, manufacturer, and purchasers have no idea what a Jeep symbol really looks like.  The Jeep grill has seven slots in the middle and not ten as shown on the bracelet. Even if someone tried to argue that it’s historical to when Ford made them decades ago, that grill was nine slots. Maybe they’d do better with Angry Eyes... if you wear this in the Jeep community, be ready to sell your Jeep."
1.0,Cheap trash. Washed them and every one frayed at the hem. I should've known better. You get what you pay for.
1.0,I bought the Xl after reading the reviews  did not even come close to a M.  My niece is a  size 2 and it got her perfectly
1.0,cut small  fabric not worth the money took weeks to get
1.0,Not a good quality earrings
1.0,Hate it
1.0,"This product is horrible. The lace ripped on day 1!!! Never worn and never washed, literally ripped right off!<br />It constantly rolled up... I felt Like I picked a size that was too small for me, but It was a 2xl... I typically wear an XL but thought I would Size up, hoping to get extra length.<br />I got Garbage.<br />Very very disappointed."
1.0,Too short omg😔 money wasted
1.0,Nice looking dress but it is way too small and does not fit as described. Order at least two sizes up if your have a larger bust.
1.0,Came way to small
1.0,no insreuctitions. couldnt figure out how to set it. no buttons. I think its a pretend watch
1.0,Is not what I expected. Dress is too small
1.0,Are not that  warm works the same way if u add an xtra regular pair
1.0,Worst leggings ever!! I was so excited to try them on and I couldn’t even get them over my foot because the bottom was so narrow. Threw them in the trash.
1.0,"Is this a joke? The skirt is literally 50% detached from the waist band. It’s comoletely falling apart. I’m returning for a replacement, and will update my review only if my replacement is in better shape."
1.0,The sizing information is not accurate.  These sizes are for teenage models maybe?  Im a GROWN woman!
1.0,Like but small
1.0,"This picture makes the dress seem fuller on that bottom it’s very flat, and uncomfortable fabric."
1.0,"There is no way any of these positive reviews are legit. These things are horrific. I feel like this is from the Wish app. The filter doesn’t fit the mask at all, and the entire masks sits 2” out from your face. The photo of my wearing it with my finger on it, shows how far it is from my mouth. My finger shows the full distance it sticks out.<br /><br />The filter and mask seem to be totally different sizes and specs so the already very poorly made mask is made much worse when the filter is installed, cuz the filter is so small, it pulls the mask even more out of shape.<br /><br />I hate to leave such a harsh review but this is just offensively bad."
1.0,"These pants are very cheaply made,  They are are already ripping."
1.0,"Nothing like pictures, i am so disappointed. I bought 2 , 1 was supposed to be a gift. $36 wasted , both hats had things broken off of them . Cheapest material ever."
1.0,It arrived broken. I was heart broken as I really liked it and it was meant to be a gift.
1.0,"I ordered extra large, usually am a small or  medium.  Too small to wear."
1.0,"Demasiado pequeño una XL es como 3 tallas menos , no aconsejo comprarla , la devolví"
1.0,They are cute. But the small plain one doesnt close all the way. No matter how hard u try it opens up again.  The big one as well. Only the middle one with 3 rhinestone works...sigh
1.0,"Ordered a XXL, dress fit like a M/L!! So tight couldn’t fit around my arms or breast, couldn’t zip up. Super tight around my hips. This must be an Asian size XXL. Definitely returned this item."
1.0,Lenses fall out constantly.  Loose fit.  Poor quality
1.0,The underwire has came out of all three bras and I have only wore them for a month.  SUCKS  Don't waste your money
1.0,I would not recommend purchasing this tank top. I purchased XL which should be a medium/large. If you wash you have a size small. I tried to send back shipping $22 purchase was $38. Not worth it.
1.0,"I'm 5'3"" 125-127 maybe even less not sure but I ordered a small going off the size chart and it's huge! It's just too much material does not fit even close to what it looks like in the pictures. It is made out of good material not cheap feeling and I was issued a full refund from seller."
1.0,"I didn't expect a lot for the price and I got even less than I expected. I bought two and neither will close. One is missing an entire wing. The wing wasn't even in the packaging so it didn't get broken in shipping, they just sold it to me that way. Both can only go in the trash."
1.0,Image is poorly printed.
1.0,The quality was not great..
1.0,Waaaaayyyy too small
1.0,"I got my  ring today 4/22  was very excited but the only disappointment I encounter is the thickness. The Ring with was advertise looks thicker than the one I received , the stones look sparkling"
1.0,Too small and would not fit really anyone properly. Everyone wearing these will have muffin top.
1.0,This shirt was probably 2 sizes too small! I am a 2X but bought a 3X because of customers reviews to up size and it fit like a large! Crazy! I am asking for a return & refund.
1.0,"At first, I was curious as to why I had not seen my review, but apparently, you can not post a review unless you spent 50 dollars on an item??!!!! Anyway, back to my original review and let's hope this post this time around<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed in this product. The item came on time and many reviews were correct in that you should definitely go a size up, however, I found upon opening the package two holes near to the cuff of the right-hand sleeve. I am going to be promptly returning this item"
1.0,These were not authentic. Did not come with certificate of authenticity.
1.0,I loved the look of these glasses thats why i purchased them however they arrived broken  due to being shipped in a bag. The lens was snapped in half.
1.0,Not cute at all  ... mailed back
1.0,Cheap looking and feels horrible.
1.0,Don't buy it.😡😡😡
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal…still too tight and waaaaay too short.
1.0,"This is a terrible skirt. I am so sad I wasted money on this. Now I have to buy another outfit to attend a wedding.<br /><br />It is NOT taffeta, but a cheap synthetic material. The skirt does not look like the photo, and is poorly made (the hems have extremely obvious stitching on all the edges). Even after I sent my exact measurements, the skirt was still too small in the waist.<br /><br />I will request a refund."
1.0,needed to have ordered 2 sizes larger
1.0,so very little...size up like 3 times
1.0,"Totally wrong size, way too small. I ordered Medium for its supposedly 17.3 Inch length. It actually 15 Inch at most including the Lined Shorts length. Regardless of being Asian size, the chart is completely wrong."
1.0,"So, the picture is not representative of what you get.  Also, these are too narrow to fit well.  I would suggest looking elsewhere.  Is it worth a return?  Not with packaging, etc.  But, they are virtually useless.  I bought one, hoping they would work and order more to keep at a cabin.  I will not order this again."
1.0,The picture featured makes it look like a sweater. That’s what I was looking for. It was a cheap light weight t shirt style knit. Cut very skimpy down the front so you can’t really wrap it in front of you much. Very disappointed.
1.0,Did not come off paper and was not able to use it on my cell phone or ipad
1.0,"I ordered silver earrings with aqua stones for my 7 year old daughter - specifically what she requested and they came in the wrong metal/color stone despite what was displayed and described. Upon returning the item and re-ordering in hopes it was an error, the same mistake happened the second time. This is not what I ordered and fortunately I was able to order the correct item from another seller. While this isn't an end of the world type problem, these would be her first earrings since she had her ears pierced, and I really wanted to get her what she wanted. Very misleading ad."
1.0,The shirt was very thin and the color was not like what was pictured.
1.0,Cotton made me itch. I think it was not good quality
1.0,Covered in typos
1.0,The words on the bracelet are spelled wrong.
1.0,Not great quality but sizing was way off. Returned it.
1.0,NOT knee high. Came up to mid calf on me and I’m a short woman. Print is okay but doesn’t look great when the socks are stretched
1.0,"Ordered a large, 30 waist, was way too small, Ordered xl and they were marked xl but just as tight.  No more orders from me."
1.0,The size is very small. I bought this for my 2 year old and it look like it's for an infant. I got the largest size they had.
1.0,These earrings are not what were depicted on Amazon's website. Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered them with purple lenses and they were not purple.
1.0,"This was horrible, and is an ackward fit. I do not recommend to buy this. I got it for my Bachelorette weekend at the beach and it came in the mail and I packed it and went on my flight. Once I got to try it on it was bad and not worth the money, I want to send it back but it's too late."
1.0,Beautiful earrings too heavy and not stable.
1.0,I only wore them a few times and the stitching at the hem is unraveling. Not sure how to contact the seller.
1.0,Don't bother!! Actual color pigment is very different than the photos!!
1.0,Cheap material cheap sport strap not comfortable at all . I don’t recommend this item.
1.0,Would give it no stars if I could. Very uncomfortable and it is definitely not the correct sizes!! Way too small
1.0,For a regular guy like me it is not comfort at all<br />It is small unisex made me struggle to wear
1.0,Looks very cheap and had a funny smell.
1.0,Ordered twice and received wrong product twice. Received a necklace instead.
1.0,Way too small - does not match measurements provided.
1.0,"Came with holes, the fit is not right. You have to order a size up from your typical size no matter what."
1.0,"I don't think these earrings are worth the asking price... I got them for a discounted price and while they are pretty they aren't worth 20$. The earrings did not come with earring backs either. I did appreciate the way they were packaged though. Individually wrapped and inside of a cute box.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />VERY cheap, they broke before I even wore them. Dont buy."
1.0,"These earrings broke after 5 weeks of wearing,  They were put in my daughter's ears on January 1 and by February 3, one of them had broken.  She never took them off; they just broke.  The return deadline was Jan 31, so I lost the price of the earrings.  Do not buy these.  They are very cute but also very thin. I am very disappointed."
1.0,"Way too long - and shrinks - makes it tighter on legs, but length remains tight and too long."
1.0,Got the bag for my mom and when it was delivered it was the wrong style. No fix to this problem as of today
1.0,Very cheaply made and doesn't feel comfortable at all. Wouldn't recommend for anyone.
1.0,Not worth the buy....
1.0,"I wore them for 4 hours and went to the bathroom to find 2 holes in the crotch! I didnt even wash them, so cheap!"
1.0,"The lock on the band won’t open and adjust and the instruction is over complicated. Terrible, had to return it."
1.0,NOT THE SWEATER IN THE PICTURE!!!!!! Thin piece of scrap material that they sewed 2 sleeves and 2 bottoms on.And 1 button is falling off and a nice hole right next to it. The color I got was orange and black.
1.0,I wear a size 7/8 and the fit is too small
1.0,"This is a light weight briefcase that is not very sturdy. I will be using it to carry papers to and from the office each day and should be ok. It wouldn't survive the luggage transport on an airline, probably get crushed or fall apart. It is more medium chocolate brown than burgandy but still has a little red in it. They should have called it medium chocolate. The only real gripe I have is the handle. Under the bottom of the handle where you curl your fingers is located a thin strip of plastic a forth inch thick and extending three eigths away from the handle and running he length of the handle, So when you carry the case this strip of plastic is pushing into your fingers and supporting the full weight of the case. If the case is loaded full and heavy then this thing is really uncomfortable and would actually hurt if you had to carry it for very long. I can't figure out why they designed the handle like this but obviously who designed it doesn't use it. But I only need to carry it from the house to the car so I can live with it. Since this is the least costly one I could find I think it will be ok for my purposes. Update-<br />2 months later the left latch broke off after I latched it and picked up the case. I guess this was money wasted and now need to shop around for a better one."
1.0,"This is not for series 3. False advertisement, does not match the rose gold series 3 watch."
1.0,One of the zippers was stuck. It was super cheap. I ended up just throwing it away. It wasn’t worth the hassle of me mailing it back.
1.0,"Pin that holds the buckle together fell out after a couple of weeks.  To bad, I liked it until this happened.  It's useless now."
1.0,Sending this back as the large was way too small even on my arms and I normally can wear either a large or a medium. Very disappointing.
1.0,"I used their size chart to order this item. It looked like it belonged on a child. I’m pretty sure inches are inches everywhere you go.  If you wear an XS/S, order the 2x."
1.0,"Will not buy again,cheaply made!"
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality in these rings. They claim to be sterling silver and that they won't tarnish or turn your finger green, however that is a blatant lie and false advertising. Rings were bought for a very sentimental memory for my mom and I, and now that memory is tarnished as well."
1.0,These cuffs aren't real leather and the price is sadly a good guide to the quality of the product in this case.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor.
1.0,Horrible fit. Even at the largest size the pant leg cuff wouldn't pull up over my calves.
1.0,"The bottoms are extremely short, definitely doesn't go up to my belly button and defeats the purpose of a high waisted two piece. The fabric does not have very much elasticity. The top does not have elasticity and the back is too wide. The black band at the bottom of the top piece is all stretched out, not sure why I received it like this. And it is also uneven.  I've posted pictures, I definitely will be returning this product... Very unhappy."
1.0,Fragile and cheap looking.
1.0,Nunca llegó el producto.
1.0,Size call out very confusing!!!!!!
1.0,"Very thin,no lining flimsy"
1.0,"The fit is terrible , something wrong with the way they were made.  I bought them for wintertime minutes my winter I should've waited because I would return them they're not worth a penny we are going to the track I wouldn't even donate these ."
1.0,"I am not happy with this product, with in a couple of days the opal fell off. Not worth it"
1.0,The heart on the bracelet is so small that I thought it was the clasp and thought the heart was not even on it.
1.0,Cheap watch
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo! There’s nothing shiny or pretty about this ring. It is a dull silver colored metal with tiny dull stones. Terrible quality!<br />Will return. This is not something that you can easily return and you have to pay the shipping cost AND package the item back in it’s original container… just overall a terrible buying experience.
1.0,Very cute except under the arm it has a large rip.
1.0,Necklace came broken
1.0,"FABRIC FLIMSEY, OTHERWISE GOOD FIT"
1.0,The sizing is way off. And it’s advertised as the sizing is right on
1.0,The material looks different than the photo. It's thin & looks like shiny double knit polyester from the seventies. Returned immediately.
1.0,This pants has great quality nut the chains are horrible I wanted to wear this to my granddaughter's bday party...however wnen I put this on the chains fell off..no it was not to tight..
1.0,There were short through the torso and provided zero compression. Very dissatisfied
1.0,"Flimsy, and not very dark tint. Will continue to buy my sunglasses from winners from now on. I might wear them while boating this summer cause I don’t care if I lose them."
1.0,These pants are very badly made and the picture misrepresents the color.  Just awful.
1.0,I got these for my birthday and the broke. they were very stylish but only lasted for about a month.
1.0,"Idéntica a la foto, pero muy pesada."
1.0,"WHO would expect 2 pins for a lapel or shirt to NOT work,,  the pins do NOT even connect for one scintilla of a second to ANY  clothing item  ..only can be used to stick the pin in the wall!!  What a joke."
1.0,Already broke.
1.0,The shirt photographed shows the zipper in the back but the shirt I received has the zipper in the front.  I figured I could wear the shirt backwards but you can see the tag right through it so it's a no go... So now I have a wonky shirt. Do not buy!
1.0,When I opened the box I thought I’d ordered the wrong color. The photo online looks very different from the actual boot color.
1.0,"Couldn’t pull 1 glove from top opening of the box as it would tear. I opened the box and removed a lump of gloves, all stuck together. Similar to what is reported in other reviews. Have to pull gloves apart carefully. Ruin one glove out of 3 or 4 in the process. Gloves disintegrate after short use."
1.0,Runs small. The medium was way too small.  The shirt itself is not good quality cotton.  The graphic is on point.
1.0,they make your boobs look like they’re sitting on your chin. awful product.
1.0,Es muy pequeño
1.0,This shirt doesn't look anything like the picture. The front is to short and the material is terrible. Very disappointed
1.0,"The watch came unassembled, was missing any kind of tool to put it together and once I finally was able to put it together on my own. It is missing two pins so I am unable to even finish it. There’s no pin to close it which is bigger than a pin to connect the links which both are missing  Terrible experience."
1.0,no!!  had to send them back!
1.0,Would not stay on.
1.0,This band is not the mint as pictured but a more blue
1.0,"Others have mentioned the size issue. If that were the only problem, I would give this 2-3 stars. However the description shows a gusset in the crotch that does not exist. I am slim and tall and I have issues bending over in these shorts, much less hiking or riding a bike. I did go with a larger size (by the chart provided I should have fit in L but I got XL) but it is still too small.<br /><br />With the gusset these would be almost usable. Without, they are not an option. Contacting the seller as we speak."
1.0,One of the seams through the crotch and up the backside came unraveled on the first wearing  I would like to return them and try another pair but I am 5 days past the return window......
1.0,"Horrible quality, way too big and a weird sweatpant like band. DON'T PURCHASE"
1.0,Chinatown crap made of metal I've never seen. Just terribly made we're broken when I got them.
1.0,"Ordered the red & it’s more beautiful than photo. Color is deeper & richer. Seems well stitched. Have been using handbag without strap & makeup case. Haven’t used the crossbody yet. While crossbody & makeup case are on small side they’re big enough. For reference the makeup bag is holding 1 compact, 1 lipstick, 1 chubby stick (Clinique), 2 Clinique almost lipsticks, 2 roll on perfumes (urban decay) & 2 nail files without difficulty zipping. The crossbody & handbag share the 1 shoulder strap. Light to medium weight handbag. Soft to touch but not slouchy.  My only complaint is there is no outside back zip pocket as pictured.  Since it has inner compartments with a light tan lining making it easy to find my phone I chose to keep it.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />After using the bag for less than a week clasp broke. Returned"
1.0,"I have had this for a few months. I wore it to Shakespeare at the Park.  When the downpour came, I thought I was prepared, but sadly mistaken...water soaked through....I had to buy a plastic poncho..."
1.0,Way too big & sheer/filmsy
1.0,"The dress was way too loose. I ordered a smaller size and it was still too loose, just shorter."
1.0,It is not durable it becomes stretched out after a few uses.
1.0,Style is amazing  just a little bit heavy
1.0,"I love the pic of the hoodie but ,,,,,There Was No Size mention, how can you buy something to wear if there is no mention on size, oh yea it said GIRLS , well girls come in all sizes!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Super cute, but their 2-3 toddler would have fit a kid 3xs  my 2 yr old.  So even though she was excited about it. We had too return it."
1.0,The ear loops are in a position that causes the neck gator to sit improperly over the nose and rise into the eyes.  A bit tight for an adult male head.  Too thin to be effective to the degree suggested by experts.
1.0,Broke the same day very cheap
1.0,Is very cheaply made and not sewn completely. My bat ears were glued on and look rushed. The material is very dry and gets hot real fast [not in a good way]. Was NOT worth so much money
1.0,"Very thin. Not soft, feels kinda scratchy. The cuts look ridiculous. Looks like a plain tshirt that someone cut with scissors a few times, with no texturization. Cuts actually look like mistakes instead of intentional fashion."
1.0,Wings arrived with feathers falling off and parts of wings had no feather to late for me to return and re order one if not I would’ve
1.0,This outfit fit at least 1 size larger than normal.
1.0,The watch did not work
1.0,"I just reordered after two years. The original I had was a smoke lens. After the first year, the strap broke and I thought, since they bragged about US customer support, no problem -- I will buy a replacement. But their website, neatly designed, contained a non-functional email contact, and a phone with no one answering it. I was able to make-do with a zip tie until now, a year later, it tore again.<br /><br />But these goggles are not the same ones (and the originals were quite nice). They are smaller, pull on my eyelids, and appear a little lesser quality. It is the same product number, but a different product.<br /><br />Too bad. I went to check the website (they encourage an email or call, still), but it is now a generic Chinese-language site now, waiting for someone to buy the domain name. The toll-free number included doesn't even pick up, and the instruction sheet is just a series of platitudes followed by instructions about how to care for the ""vapor coating""."
1.0,"Weird fit. I ordered a medium, but the crotch was super large in relation to the inseam. I had to pull the medium up past my navel to get anything that felt like the liner was where it was supposed to be."
1.0,Too small for my dad
1.0,Got this for my 11 year old son and it was shocking small. Total waste
1.0,Returning item.
1.0,"UPDATE TO MY LAST REVIEW!!! Now that I have had time to actually look at the wallet, I can now tell you that it is a knock off!! There is leaked glue on the inside. Nothing was sewn right. It is HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!! It is NOT AT ALL LIKE MY STOLEN WALLET!!! I am so pissed that I just got robbed again!!! Thank you so much for making what I just went thru so much worse!!! I want my money back!!!!<br /><br />Old review: I couldn't wait for this wallet to arrive. I bought this wallet about 6 months ago and loved it so much. I was recently robbed and they not only drained my bank account but they also got my favorite wallet of all time. So you can imagine how excited I was to find out my hubby ordered me a new one off of Amazon. The picture was exactly like my stolen wallet but it arrived today only to have cheetah print on the inside. I hate cheetah print more than anything. My first Jessica Simpson double zipper wallet was all black and the pictures showed that this one was too but it's not. I am extremely disapoointed that we paid $60 for something I never would've bought had I known it had cheetah print on the inside so don't but it if you want all black. It won't come to you that way."
1.0,sizing is wrong and it does not fall off your shoulder like the picture.
1.0,No button holes on the left strap!!!!<br />Button hole on right side doesn’t even hold the button!!!<br />Very disappointed I’m going to have to take it somewhere to be repaired😤
1.0,"How could this possible be what I ordered?? Please see the photo of the “suggested” product versus what I’ve received.<br />Cheap, false!"
1.0,"If I could give this item a negative 5 I would. Absolutely terrible construction, cheap plastic shield fogs when you breath, worse of all the shields are not clear to begin with. Worse product I've ever purchased through Amazon."
1.0,"If you like compression…..  decent pouch design, but compressed. No wiggle room. It stays put for sure. Never buying again."
1.0,"Way to small, these shirts are junk, if you wash them, I'm sure they will fall apart."
1.0,"I wouldn't consider myself fat,  I am 5'4 and 106 lbs, but when I've put those stockings on my legs the straps were too tight and unflattering... so either buy it way larger, or avoid at all."
1.0,"I gave this a low rating since it is no as described. In the description it says leather/silicone, that is what the original is. But I was sent a all silicone band. So I returned and asked for the correct one. Once again I was sent the same band. I am uncertain if the seller knows what leather is but they may want to learn. I gave 5 stars for ease of installation because it was very easy to replace. If you look at the picture the band on the right is the original band, leather/silicone."
1.0,"Bought this as a gift, wasn’t happy with the quality of the product. Ear muffs were flat and none of the products material was the same"
1.0,they're just ok
1.0,"This is so much longer and larger than in the pics. Just huge. It’s like wearing a sheet. Size down by at least 2, and expect it to be long."
1.0,"The bracelets are too big, I am unable to feel comfortable wearing them. But they are noticable."
1.0,"The garment is cheap fabric and the elastic stitching on the waistband came off immediately.  The waistband doesn't need those three rows of topstitching, so it was fine.<br />The bigger problem was in the fit.  I got a size large.  The fabric measured 40 inches at the waist and 50 inches at the hips.  The elastic is fit to a 25-26 inch waist.  That's a size 2!  I have a 28 inch waist and 40 inch hips right now, so I can wear it, but it's very uncomfortable and very unflattering.  I also bought a different print in a size medium, but they sent me a small and the waist band is like 20 inches.  It took a month to ship, so I'm just going to cut my losses."
1.0,The material was cheap i bought 3 the package said the size but not a tag inside
1.0,rickety
1.0,3 months and starts falling a part.
1.0,"Product was made of nice material but the sizing was off. I wear an XL, ordered a XXL  and it was too small"
1.0,Quality not worth the price
1.0,"It was very cute and I was happy with it for the 24hours I had it. But then I dropped my phone on the carpet, not even a hard surface, and the charm broke off. Only way to fix is to re-soder, which I don't have the ability to do. Now I just have the crystal stud in the jack. Not as cute."
1.0,Fell apart in two days waist of money. Only up side is its kind of cute....but save the picture and keep your money in your pocket!
1.0,"I loved this in the pic, but when it arrived, I was terribly dissapointed. Not as vibrant as pic and it is thick material that wrapped around your body and hung funky. Looks like it would fall apart with first washing. Dissapointed. Had to send it back."
1.0,"Ok really? My son ordered these and he got a large since it says for shoe sizes 9-10. It came in today and on the shoe box it says for shoe sizes 11-12. My son isn&#34;t even a size 9, but he was worried that the 7-8 would be too small. Well, on the bright side, they sure aren't too small. My son is very bummed out and I for one am very unhappy. Not to mention there's a sting hanging from the stitching on one of the shoes. Looks like my husband is involuntarily getting some moccasins..."
1.0,It had this weird netting in the middle kinda like a bathing suit.. not what i thought i was ordering
1.0,No and no<br />This is night time bonnet or a thick wig cap material smh.....<br />Just skip it!
1.0,Horrible- THESE DON'T WORK!A
1.0,"Here's how mine showed up.<br /><br />No power cord supplied either. The packing consisted of a box that snugly fits the winder laying in a box triple its size with 1 sheet of brown paper. Kind of like a big cardboard box rattle toy, with the winder doing the rattling around. What a joke."
1.0,Horribly made dress. Did not look anything like the picture. Very thin material.
1.0,"Horrible and bad quality clothes. Not recommended, shorts are tight on the waist and way too long, terrible made. Not even the original baby shark from the video (as you can see in the advertisement) so it doesn't even worth 5 bucks."
1.0,Was tight in the shoulders and looks nothing like the pictures and was very thin
1.0,Ordered March 17th. Broke May 5th. Horrible quality. Don’t waste your money. Post completely separated from pearl.
1.0,The item was too big.  I didn’t get a chance to return the item because the time slipped by so quickly.  I’d wear the item if it wasn’t so darn big.  Oh well
1.0,"Quality is poor, chain pinches my neck"
1.0,Just after 2 washes got bubble all over. Not happy
1.0,"Not at all the material pictured. The picture lookalike textured material, it's not!  It's Tshirt material with a pattern inked on. Very long, 3 inches past by knees and I'm 5-5&#34;.  Going back"
1.0,"No, they were both broken on arrival."
1.0,"I should have realized by the price. This is a very cheap plastic pendulum with absolutely no weight  to it. The chain is attached off center making it inaccurate and useless as a pendulum. Now, I have to spend my time going to a UPS store to return - don't put yourself through this."
1.0,I did not like it. The straps were loose and the fabric was terribly thin and the petty coat under it was see through.
1.0,This product must be made for toddlers. I have very small ankles I’m a petite woman and could barely clasp on the last hook.
1.0,"I was sooo enthusiastic when i ordered this bag, but now when i received it i am veryyyy disappointed :( :( :(<br />The size is great, the color is perfect. But......i feel very sad....because i couldn't wait for my order and this is what i get.<br />See picture."
1.0,"Very thin material, sheds horrible still after two washes.. not impressed at all.."
1.0,"It came and fit well, but the entire front pouch was torn, almost completely off."
1.0,Was not happy with the quality of the wallet.
1.0,"They look good, but the studs on back were both broken and it took over a month to deliver. The price was so low I just didn't bother with sending them back."
1.0,Nunca recibí el el pedido que compre
1.0,Definitely not as pictured. Returned this item immediately.
1.0,"Terrible fit, the material looks like it came from a cheap Halloween costume."
1.0,"Literally broke the 1st time I even tried to put them on. And solder won't stick to it so I can't even fix it. They look good, but it's just shoddy construction therefore rendering them useless"
1.0,"This is an interesting military style watch, BUT I did not receive the white presentation case or the 2 yr. Seiko/Pulsar warranty card.  In the general description of this watch on Amazon these items are included.  I would like to have the nice white presentation case that should come with this  and the warranty card.  I have some doubts about this watch being new.  The watch came in an incorrect plastic case with no warranty information.  A white presentation Pulsar case is shown in this dealers ad on E bay of this watch for sale which I saw today.  This watch I BELIEVE is FAKE because the case has porous alloy composition and the movement dial is not marked Japan."
1.0,It looks much different in person and it turned black really fast
1.0,"poor quality, does not look like photo. Dress is see thru. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,Way smaller then it appears in the picture. The opening on this doesn't even fit on any part of my ear. It's way to small and not adjustable at all. I even tried taking a wrench to bend it open- not satisfied with this purchase.
1.0,I wish I could give zero stars!!! A big ass zero I ordered the style in the dp and the material is cheap! It literally popped while examining it smh I didn’t even try it on yet.Also if ur d or did cup perky or not this is not for u
1.0,Absolutely not true to size
1.0,"Disappointing, very small demut color. Return for credit. A 82 year old will not be able to read the print"
1.0,"This product is so big, I could never wear it. The company would not take it back."
1.0,NOT AS CUTE AS THE PHOTO! Way too big and icky
1.0,Definitely not sterling silver! Very cheap
1.0,Material was poor.Sewed wrong nothing like the picture
1.0,VERY CHEAPLY MADE WOULD NOT STAY TIED MATERIAL WAS VERY FLIMSY
1.0,"My son just bought these and they came damaged.  They were bent on the frame which makes them look crooked on your face. I would hope my son will get an answer from the seller as he just emailed them.  If they don't replace them, they will go in the garbage.  What a waste of $30."
1.0,Was very disappointed purse has a shine to it like plastic or vinyl.  The picture in add shows it almost like natural leather which I liked and it's as tall as it is wide in the post but not the one I received it is wide but not tall. Will not order from this seller again. Save your money..
1.0,Very disappointed with the product descriptions very misleading I ordered 2 trench coats Black And Khaki. Descriptions stated one inside pocket for cell and wallet but and I both recieved my orders both coats don't have pocket inside.  The coats fits nice just disappointed that it has No Pocket.
1.0,I’d give this no stars.  It is not a sweater
1.0,It’s cute but the strings aren’t like a normal wrap dress. You have to be creative with it and it kinda ruins the dress. Because it gets wrinkled. Think they are missing the inside strings because it’s only the bug outside string.
1.0,"Did not look like the pic, the waist was very small"
1.0,"I've bought several rings various sizes and shapes, but these I thought would be amazing because they were octopus arms. NOPE. After adjusting the ring so it would fit my finger the first loop broke. I used a second ring and the suckers kepts snagging the yarn. Third ring the whole arm snapped in half."
1.0,"Ordered XXL, product said XXL, wouldn't go any higher than my crotch.  So disappointed,  I wanted these for skiing"
1.0,Not even close to the EE size advertised.  Beware!!!
1.0,Horrible fit the adjusters slide
1.0,"The lights didn’t work, even after charging for several days. Frustrating, and my son was so sad about it!"
1.0,Cheap!!!
1.0,Came from China. To SMALL
1.0,Poor quality. I returned it.
1.0,These are not worth a dollar! Cheap glass with a DECAL on the back. Not worth returning. I will never buy from the seller again. I am furious.
1.0,"I purchased this item as the size I received fit like it was 2-sizes  too small.  I'm 5'9 175lbs ordered an XL, unfortunately I had to return."
1.0,these don't even fit my 3 year olds head
1.0,"The label on the underwear confirms that it is a blend of 71% cotton, 29% viscose (if memory serves). The color is described accurately, and they looked like they would have fit fine when removed from packaging. Huge disappointment to see that they were not all-cotton. Synthetic fabrics and underwear are a bad combination, in my opinion. Amazon customer service was great and refunded the purchase as soon as the return was scanned at the UPS dropoff location."
1.0,"I didn't wear these earrings while they were still in the return period, but just tried them and I cannot even open them to wear. I feel that if I forced them open I would break them, and I'm not even sure forcing them would get them to open. I messed with just 1 for 20 mins, then quickly attempted to use the other and when that didn't open I just disappointedly gave up. Pass on these. No good"
1.0,After first wash print faded and peeled up. I washed in cold water on the gentle cycle. Hung to dry.
1.0,Poorly quality. Did not fit properly. Unable to use.
1.0,Shirt is too short and small. Normally wear m/l and ordered xl. Returned.
1.0,"number one they are too big, they are more of a size large. Second you can't print your label and you dont say where to send back and how to pack it when it came in a big box with other name pajamas that fit, which is mediumi."
1.0,I hate how bulky it is does even look nice wearing it
1.0,Dress fit..it was just way too late for the event! It took way too long to receive it!
1.0,"I was so excited to order this blouse but was disappointed with what was received. The blouse is very thin and sheer. It’s not as dressy as what is pictured. The material fits tighter than sized too. In my opinion, it’s very cheaply made and not worth the money."
1.0,"They were definitely light weight but VERY cheaply made.  3 pair have already fallen off the metal pierce earring.  I would not suggest buying these.  I would return them, except I shared several pairs with friends.  They thought the same as far as poor quality!!!"
1.0,Don’t buy the necklace want stay in place it keeps flipping over....I missed the return window now I’m stuck with it 😢
1.0,Fell apart after only wearing it for a week started to change color in the first two days also
1.0,A lot smaller than I expected. Appears to be a rather large bag in the advertised pictures. It's rather thin. It's definitely not going to last any longer than a couple weeks of use. I wouldn't waste my money ordering this bag.
1.0,Awkward. Too short and big at top.  Returning.
1.0,The print was printed on the inside of the onesie so the tag was on the outside of the onesie. It’s a black onesie so cutting the tag will still show a white tag on the fold. Very disappointed with this.
1.0,No thank you disappointed.
1.0,"Very very peachy colored. Looks terrible on my skin tone. Never would of bought this if i knew. And the size chart is off cause the skirt is Soo loose in the waist. Whole outfit looks awful,sadly. and i was so hype too..like.. ouch."
1.0,"They feel great and look ok on. I wasn't completely impressed. They are kinda weird at the top. But my biggest issue is that I wore them ONCE, washed them as instructed and the pocket came undone. It's falling off the pants. I ordered two colors, I'm now afraid to wear the other ones."
1.0,The sleeves or short and don't even reach your elbows the picture is misleading
1.0,"Instead of the three pairs of earrings shown, the package I got had just one pair of earrings and some sticky ""jewels"".  I've sent a request to return the stuff, but it needs ""approval"" by the seller.  Seriously?  I get something totally different than I ordered, and I have to get permission to return it?  Classy, folks."
1.0,HORRIBLE! Very cheaply made!
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter and her friend to have as friendship bracelets.  Both sets fell apart within a week, and the ones with the beads broke as soon as they put them on. Felt badly, because it was a birthday gift."
1.0,Very very disappointing  to say the least  :(  I won't be a repeat buyer
1.0,Nunca llego
1.0,"I am a small girl and even on me this bra is small, tight and not comfortable for all day wear at all. Imagine being a size 2, and being sent a size 00, that's what this bra feels like on my, like I'm being squeezed. Not flattering at all either because it runs small, so instead of adding cleavage, it squeezes you, yikes."
1.0,"It didn’t arrive on time initially. When it was received it smelled odd. After I washed it several times, it didn’t fit well and I was unimpressed with the entire experience. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,Carry my weight in my mind section. This shirt is way to small and short. I expected a big slouch shirt. It doesn't fit even tight. Wish I had known it came from China before I purchased it. That would have told me it was cheap and will not wash at all.
1.0,"I bought this belt on April 13, on May 19 the belt came apart and can no longer be used or returned, it was definitely not worth the money I paid for it"
1.0,"It's always best to err on the side of longer, rather than shorter.  It costs more, but it saves returns for those like me with chubby ear lobes."
1.0,Horrible print work. Won’t buy from again. Not recommended.
1.0,Got this for my grandma. Barely stays in head because it’s so shallow
1.0,Never ever buy these.
1.0,"The product did not look at all like the photo shown. The shorts I received were black and after on wear the seams in the crotch area started to fall apart. I was supposed to receive the ""correct"" color and it never arrived."
1.0,"The back Velcro price that helps keep hat on head, separated from the hat and now it can clasp close, leaving me unable to wear the hat any longer. This happened the second time I put it on :("
1.0,I only had it a week and it broke. Now I got to send it back and it's costen me $5.95 it cost me $7.95 ?
1.0,"Caps are not good for wigmaking, the ones I got did not have the full elastic bands along the bottom, and barely stretch fully over my head which I was not aware of. I thought they resembled more like the spandex dome cap but the fit is nothing like."
1.0,I'm so disappointed in this. I've had it about a month and it's covered in strings. The terrycloth is literally unraveling. It didn't soften up in the washing machine. Wouldn't buy again or recommend to anyone.
1.0,I thought I could ware it on my pinky finger knowing it would be small but it still was much too small to look like the photo. Also the &#34;heart&#34; look at the end looked like a round dot. No point no indent.
1.0,Material is see through and cheap.
1.0,Not happy with this product.
1.0,"Looks like a cross between grass, jade, and mildew greens. . . .  no shine.<br />But I got what I deserved for 10$"
1.0,"It doesn’t look anything like the photo, the bodice is way to small and it doesn’t offer any support. The package arrived completely torn open."
1.0,cheap in one month sow started to come apart i was wondering why my socks were always wet rip off don't waste your money
1.0,"The sizing on this is really messed up. If you don't have a waist, it might fit. Short and wide. Total waste of money."
1.0,Poor quality printed image is distorted. Better off going to a local shop getting a custom print.
1.0,Awful material and smaller than anticipated
1.0,As cheap as the bowl of chinese rice served to the overworked boy in your friendly neighborhood hong kong sweat shop
1.0,Too short cheaply made and very thin material
1.0,Pictured is not what you get it is very tight and very small
1.0,Lasted a week!  I bought two pair and both pair  tore apart at the toes
1.0,POOR QUALITY PRINTING BUT IT GETS BY.  Ink isn't expected to last long because it seems to not adhere to the material properly.
1.0,"Terrible fit, slides off"
1.0,"The shirt quality is poor, even for the price."
1.0,Broken when I received them. Very disappointed 😔
1.0,Was trash took forever to ship and looks so fake
1.0,Picture is no where near what actual product is. The bottoms are not flared at all. Total waste of money.  So much for wearing boots with these
1.0,"I disliked everything about these. They are itchy, the colors are not pretty. I would not buy again. They still sit in the package, should have returned them."
1.0,"Horrible shoes, the right foot peep toe front was a lot larger than the left foot and it was so large that my foot kept on sliding out Also the heels are light and hollow and when you walk they make it a clunky cheap sound. Return them"
1.0,This is the worst don't buy n the vendor won't give u your money back DONT BUY
1.0,This was a $9 joke I played on myself. I ordered a 2X and it might fit a six year old.
1.0,CHEAP!
1.0,Used for less then 2 weeks and it keeps falling apart. Not with the money
1.0,"Lost 3 in of length in the first wash, no longer long enough."
1.0,I am disappointed my package
1.0,"Added expedited shipping and the order was cancelled three weeks later, the day the item was expected for Halloween. Unreliable, do not recommend. Broke my son’s heart."
1.0,Doesn't fit anything like this and the material isnt sewn good at all
1.0,"Seriously if you wear a large don’t even bother ordering. I gave this shirt to my 9 year old daughter. Highly upset because it’s really nice but way to small. I guess my loss , my daughters gain. I guess I can buy an XL & come back to update you all."
1.0,I did not care for this material at all and the size is smaller than what you normally wear.
1.0,Not for adult women.  Cut small and looks like lingerie.
1.0,Poor Quality.. Don't buy..
1.0,"Its not real, i put it in and my belly button became sore"
1.0,"Do not order this , it was  not at all like the picture . Stitching was shredded . Material was really bad ."
1.0,"I am 5'5&#34; tall,  125 lbs., 34DD breasts.<br />Based on reviews; I ordered a Size L; in hopes to cover breast..... Wrong! It's plenty big around chest..... but it looks like I'm wearing a headband across my breast!!! Waaaay too narrow! Doesn't cover bottom of breast at all. Don't recommend unless you are an A/B cup size."
1.0,"These are super cute and inexpensive, but I only got 2-3 wears per pair, even though I kept them in individual boxes to protect them. They knots are not glued or secured, so they come undone, and the thread falls out. I tried to get them back in, but it’s no easy task. I would recommend a dot of glue under the slipknot."
1.0,Wings are not of good construction.  The headband was not included with the order as advertised.
1.0,WAYYYYYYY TO SMALL TO FIT.
1.0,Cheap cheaply made. Fake plastic ring fake plastic stone. No reason to spend the money when you get the same quality from the coin macho hat a grocery
1.0,Very cheap glasses. Definitely not worth the cost
1.0,"No  Sheer back, looks like a little girl's dress"
1.0,"I got a XXXL and it's probably a medium. I'm a size 18 and I couldn't even get my forearm through this. I kinda figured as much, but thought I'd try it anyway. Just spreading the research."
1.0,Kept getting a delayed shipping notice. Finally arrived. I had to use a dental pick to get it to open and after many many tries and a few special words I had success. I added the charms and put it on. I have a large wrist and the largest size is good. BUT now I can’t get it to open again (stabbed myself in the thumb with the dental pick so I stopped that method) so I guess I will be wearing this for all eternity. It’s pretty but really didn’t plan on it being a permanent accessory.<br /><br />Update: well that was officially a waste of money. Finally had to cut it off my arm because no one could get the clasp open to remove it! 😠
1.0,Looked nice.  Lasted one day.
1.0,It’s very thin and not good to cook with it.
1.0,We just received the wallet yesterday and it continues to chirp when pluged in but wont take a charge .
1.0,These run 2 sizes small
1.0,the size is too small even for 1 year olds. The picture is  very deceptive.
1.0,Looks cheap super cheap like a cheap costume. I had to return it
1.0,Very upset couldn't open they were so tight that they bend the earrings and the little hoop with small broke away metal was so soft and u gave a 5 star I can't be the only one have this problem
1.0,The gauge was way too large for my tragus piercing.
1.0,horrible too big. Please dont waste your money.highly not recommended
1.0,Runs EXTREMELY SMALL
1.0,Cheap material. I'm really worry when I wash them fabric really thin
1.0,Did absolutely nothing! Don't waste your money. Returned it.
1.0,Big and baggy not fitted at all
1.0,The material is too cheap. It seems I make a bad decision when buying this one. It is really waste off money
1.0,These were not worth what I paid. The black one came broken right out of package. The grey one broke in less than a month and the white one doesn’t fit correctly. It’s huge at top and looks bunch under scrubs and sweat shirts.
1.0,Hard to wear and take it out
1.0,"I recived a different item, different color and bad quality"
1.0,Glass was broken when it arrived.
1.0,1 week used and the necklace darked.
1.0,this is not for exercise as it offers no support.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"It's just as pretty as the picture. But the one I got was defective and I returned it. It was nearly impossible to pry open and when it shut, it sounded like a gunshot, it was so loud. And it could have amputated a finger, that's how hard and fast it closed."
1.0,Cheap quality and not helpful.
1.0,Stone missing. Post bent.
1.0,"Although this is a cute dress in the picture, it’s not on me ! Would be great if I were built like the model wearing it but I have a bit more fat than she does. I seriously looked like a cupcake. It was awful!"
1.0,The little bronze turtle fell off the first week
1.0,So small that gave them to my granddaughter and they fit her.
1.0,I was very excited to get these. Only to find out Id be missing 2. Not cool!
1.0,Bathing suit runs 2 sizes small.
1.0,I wanted a swing coat BUT this coat was not the one. The front hem was 1-11/2 inch longer than the back. The top button by the funnel neck gapped so the coat was open. The flare was so extreme that it folded back. The pockets were placed on the seam; would be in danger of tearing the coat to use the pockets. The stitching was visible on the hem. Unattractive.
1.0,Crappie quality
1.0,They just don’t stay on at all. No matter how much I tightened them within a half hour or so they were falling off again.
1.0,Too thin! Can't wear in public.  So now they are jammy pants.  Not happy!
1.0,Too big for me and broke apart within one week of wearing it. Cheap quality
1.0,Es Bonita pero es muy pequeña
1.0,no me funciono
1.0,Returned- description said built in cups- they are NOT built in but removable
1.0,Don't order. CHEAP
1.0,ZERO traction and do not bend- not safe or appropriate for toddlers.
1.0,Salió muy mala calidad se despegó
1.0,I can wear a size kids 16/18 and this was tight on me. Velcro doesn’t hold so had to be tied tightly with strings. Not very comfortable this way. I am also 5’5 and kept tripping on it since I couldn’t keep it secure around my waist. Kept falling to my hips. Hoops are made from plastic so I can imagine it will last long so wouldn’t buy if this was something you needed for more than one occasion. Very disappointed purchased to use under my Colonial costume so will have to find another one that actually works.
1.0,After opening the package the lens had 2 deep scratches. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Very disappointed, when I washed it to get it ready for my vacation all the thread came off. I lost my money."
1.0,I was disappointed that the fabric on the neck didn't match the white color on the rest of the dress. It was cream color and didn't go with the dress. I returned it
1.0,"Size is completely off. Material seems good, stretchy."
1.0,DONT BUY
1.0,"I ordered these as bridesmaid gifts for them to wear the morning of my wedding. I ordered a small a medium and an extra large per the sizing the bridesmaids requested in “multicolored”.<br />The small and medium came in a nude/tan color, while the extra large was a blush/tan color! Individually these might not be as bad (although the material is cheap and see through) but know that ordering for a group of people in different sizes won’t match color or design!<br />Picture 1. Top dress (in bag) is medium<br />Bottom dress (in bag) is xl"
1.0,They were fine until they broke after a week.  They are way too flimsy around the lenses.
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I received this watch. It is not as the picture. So terrible! I bought 2 watches, one for me and one for my friend. How can I return them?"
1.0,Laces popped while trying to lace sneakers.
1.0,"I ordered Brown and Burgundy. I didn’t know these were capris. These are NOT what I wanted. They are far too short. The fabric snagged on one pair while I was trying them on. The crotch in the burgundy pair is sewn crooked so they feel weird. The fleece inside is nice and soft but that’s about the only positive thing I have to say about them. I am 5’7” and 150lbs. I usually wear a 9/10 in jeans. My legs are not particularly long either.  I very rarely leave a negative review but now I see why they were a Daily Deal... that’s how amazon unloads their crappiest merchandise, but I expected better quality from Leggings Depot."
1.0,It's a waste of money grafics are horrible it looks nothing as advertised
1.0,"They broke while I was wearing, oops they just broke"
1.0,"Pathetic.got it replaces ,even then the same problem. Very poor stitching n keeps on opening up along the stitch line.not worth any rating"
1.0,They had a scratch on them!
1.0,Shirt is not anywhere true to size. XXL is more like a small. I could not even get my arms through the sleeves it was so small.
1.0,"Poor, these gloves are ladies in the large size."
1.0,"The earring is impossible to hook closed. I wish I had sent them back, but I didn’t wear them right away I saved them for a special trip and outfit. Again the hook latch is awful."
1.0,It was flimsy and not worth the price
1.0,The water bladder is a huge lump in my back that bounces and jiggles all over the place. There just isn't enough support. Ended up getting the Osprey Dyna instead and even though it offers less storage it's been fantastic and holds my trekking poles in the front or back.  Not to mention it was significantly cheaper.
1.0,"I love the designs of theproducts, but the flower ring was too small for my nose and it hurt really bad. The other clicker it was a struggle for me to get it to click I had to kinda of mess with the clicker a few times to get it to click. Once I got it to click it fell out of my nose. Also I notice that the clickers are starting to turn green."
1.0,I love stance socks. I absolutely hated these. My feet were always cold in them. They must have cut of my circulation. Not the best offering from Stance.
1.0,Mande a buscar el color Blue y lo enviaron Navy
1.0,Very fitted and not even close to a 3X. Didn’t even cover all of my belly. Very disappointed
1.0,"Opened the bathing cap, as instructed and it split open on the seam.  It would never have tolerated being stretched.<br />The goggles had scratches on the lenses and the reflective coating was flaking off.  Glad I bought thru Amazon for easy refund."
1.0,Cheap! Finish sticks out when next to and actual Pandora charm.
1.0,I love the tan pair I received.  I may end keeping if the postage is too high. Because there is another pair they claim the shipper sent but I have received.  I like it if fits! I would suggest no purchasing from this seller.
1.0,I a a 34 inch waist and decent size &#34;package&#34; and I ordered XL which is way too small. I would not order this again.
1.0,After 3 days of wear I developed a pain on my right foot at the end of my small toes the placement of the steel toe digs on the very sensitive toes. Pain eased after using different shoes. Will be returning<br />Sad because I like the looks.
1.0,Returned them
1.0,"Hat was $60.  It arrived ripped at the seam.  Also, was shipped in envelope.  Who ships hat in envelope so I arrived bent and misshapen.  Would not recommend to worst enemy"
1.0,"I really liked the look and feel when this first came in the mail. It’s very comfortable, and it’s not a heavy material. The maroon color is also very attractive and in my opinion would look good on just about any complexion. Unfortunately, I’ve washed it probably about four times, and the words are disintegrating or peeling off. If you have a cricket or an account with an on demand printer company you might get a much better screen print quality than this one. Would not recommend if you plan on wearing it more than once."
1.0,They are almost impossible to get right with your teeth. Very uncomfortable and they would not stay in place. Did everything on the directions
1.0,"Terrible shorts. I ordered a medium and they fit like a 2X. Super baggy and loose. The waistband fit as expected, but the rest of the shorts were awful. A poor design. I had to return them with no expectation of trying to resize and order again"
1.0,"These earrings are very cute,and exactly what I hoped for EXCEPT the chain is too big so I cannot thread them through my holes. Not even close, it really hurt when I tried.  I am really disappointed."
1.0,"Cool shirt, unfortunately I ordered an XL and got a small. Oh well, my daughter liked it"
1.0,too small and fabric was subpar
1.0,This waist trainers material is not the material as said in description nor expected and says to measure waist which I had correct and the package sizing goes by weight! Was way to big Besides that shipping was great received on time.. and no problem returning refund was processed within few days
1.0,This is an honest review:<br />Beware: they are not how they seem. They do not look like the picture. They are see through and super thin. They are like $1 leggings. Not athletic at all.
1.0,"What a joke of a watch. I wore it for about 3 weeks consistently and then suddenly without warning, I was sitting at my desk, and the strap broke off of the watch face...<br />Poor construction.<br />It may look nice, but it won't hold up for even a month.<br /><br />Also, note there is no second hand."
1.0,The bar is so short my ear absorbed the earring back in half a day and we had to cut open my helix to remove it
1.0,"This only looks good in the photo. The sizing is way off, and the quality is poor"
1.0,Shirt was to tight and sleeves were to baggy. It was the worst fitting shirt I ever bought.
1.0,"It came on time. The material is ok. It fits as expected size wise, but a very weird cut. So it just looks awkward.  Also I'm 5'8"" and it is at least 2 inches too long for me."
1.0,Shirt came in with seems coming apart at the shoulder. Sending it back to replace. Hopefully the next one will be better quality .
1.0,This product was of very poor quality.<br />It was returned.
1.0,The garment is made of some plastic like material and then you have to pay for it to be shipped to return.  I would not recommend you buy this item.
1.0,"Thing is back too far, not enough room for foot to slip upward."
1.0,Was labeled men's XL.....but won't fit a medium size child.  Terrible.  Had to give it away.
1.0,"It was a beautiful dress and fit perfectly. Unfortunately it wasn’t constructed very well. The seams fell apart after one washing and the fabric snagged really easily. Had the dress been made more sturdily, this would have been a long-time favorite."
1.0,Bad reflection
1.0,"terrible , i wear a small and these ripped and wouldnt go past my thighs , not near as elastic as I thought !"
1.0,Very bad watch; I've got it with broken glass in front. I think I am going to throw it in the bin
1.0,"Jacket is perfect, the zipper is a total disaster. I would like to get my Money back. If not, I probably end up throwing it away because I wouldn't want to inflict the frustration on anyone else."
1.0,Super small.  Went up 3 sizes and still didn't fit
1.0,Horrible fit. Way to short and small  picture doesn’t match item.
1.0,"I used it only once and it broke, the worst quality"
1.0,This was returned because it was way too small and didn't come together as shown.
1.0,No good you have to cut way too much off to make them work very stiff and they do not stick
1.0,"Honestly, if you plan to wear these for more than 30nseconds, you may as well just go get a real piercing. The pain would likely be less. They're also much bigger than the pictures and look fake."
1.0,"Very disappointed by the colors of the products I received, they did not correspond at all to the colors shown in the reference image for the purchase, I thought they would be more varied colors with reds, blues, blacks and yellows, but I received items in only shades Pink color."
1.0,The hat came stuffed into a box and no matter how I tried it could not be reshaped to look normal.
1.0,Cheaply made for the price!
1.0,It fell apart in 4 days! Just 4 days!!! Not happy.
1.0,"Shirts arrived with holes, and the white is dingy from sitting in the same bag as the black and grey shirts. I can make 2 of the tops work, and stitch the holes up, and use as layering tops. Easier than the hassle of returning."
1.0,"i wouldnt recommend this product, it does not look like it did in the picture(a lot of things do not) but it doesnt fit my arms, the sleeves are too short. different frabric than what it was describe. i still have not worn it. plan on giving it away."
1.0,Item just quit working about a month after first use. Probably luck of the draw. I will not buy another or any other similar.
1.0,"The straps on this are really weird, it's like a smock. The print looks too bold like you actually rolled paint onto the dress. The sizing is accurate though."
1.0,To cumbersome to use and quality is questionable one our mask came with a broken nose piece
1.0,Thought it was plastic but it isn't. It's very thin metal and the rhinestones dont stick out like the picture. The rim is thick and very flared. It hurts to put them in and out cuz the rim is sharp
1.0,Really cheaply made!!! bas fit! better to spend more money! You get what you pay for!
1.0,"Product came and ALL the snaps at the bottom of the onesie are broken, this was supposed the be a st Patrick day outfit for church and now I have to use pants to cover up the bottom of the onesie super disappointed."
1.0,Broke first time wearing.
1.0,Zipper broke after 2 months. Disappointed 😔
1.0,Hard time keeping it my mask
1.0,"Great style and very comfortable, but the first time I wore it the black part on the top bled into the teal part. It is now stained and useless. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Earrings came with cats facing the same way, not facing each other as shown. Very disappointed. It looks silly when I wear them"
1.0,Its 150$ if you have to bvb return it. So beware if you buy and it's not a good fit!
1.0,"Very large size. I'm 5'3"" and about 110#. Dress was more like a nightie"
1.0,Do not waste your money. Doesn't work.
1.0,My bag arrived dirty and the crayon box and coloring book were so damaged! Worse $20 I've spent now I have to go out and replace it! 😠😠
1.0,Iam really disappointed in this hat. The hat ripped less then a week of wairing it. Other then that the hat fits great and looks great just wish it would last longer.
1.0,"received immediately opened, and noticed a scratch on the frame, apparently the goods were returned, and the seller sold it back!"
1.0,I have the Tesla printed key and this doesn't fit it. No instructions and most likely requires taking apart original fob.
1.0,"Terrible quality, not the same shade, falling apart at the seems"
1.0,Very awful rough scratchy fabric. You could exfoliate with these. Absolutely hate them.
1.0,I was very pleased at how well it fit along with how fast it was shipped. However.. I was missing part of the costume. Which sucks for the price I paid I should get everything. Majorly disappointed.<br /><br />The dress’s sequins are falling off after trying it on ONCE. I’m happy I’m just wearing it for a costume party for an hour. Any longer the whole dress might as well be thrown in the trash.
1.0,"The lens came scratched, it has the dimensions printed on the lens, and the lenses are rose colored instead of clear. Quite the disappointing product."
1.0,These absolutely do not aid in diminishing glare or help w/night vision... they do is turn everything yellow. They do help brighten everything up on a cloudy day...
1.0,No pockets  not warm
1.0,I drank this coffee for 3 weeks and started to get really ill not knowing that it was the coffee.  Used the left overs to kill fruit flies in my compost container.  Love yourself with a fresh artisan roast.  This purchase led me to a small town roaster that will give me beans no older than 3 days roasted.
1.0,This literally was paper! Horrible costume I sent it back
1.0,Broke day one
1.0,The clips on the end are too small.  Can't get it to clip onto sweater.
1.0,"I've had these for 2 weeks, worn them maybe 5 times and there is already fabric ripping in the rear seat.<br /><br />Do not recommend. Also size up for a more comfortable fit."
1.0,Plastic is to hard not and flexible
1.0,"Package looks nice and good quality but so disappointed with hygiene. They sent over the bag with tiny shaving hair, must be from previous users returning the package. So concerning!"
1.0,Definitely not as pretty as it looked on site
1.0,"Does not look anything like the photo, unless you are in a very dark room. Optics are so dim so that you can only really see that the bottom of the tie is illuminated, unless you're in a closet. Instructions said not to fold tie or could cause damage, BUT TIE ARRIVES ALREADY FOLDED UP IN A TIE BOX!!! It does light up, but unless you're wearing it to a very dark party or disco, it's a waste of money. You will not look like the pic, even indoors. For the cost of this, I feel like it was a big waste of money. I'm disappointed."
1.0,sweater was very small and did not even have the length it shows .
1.0,"I ordered these shirts in boys extra large. They are the same size a toddler 5t. My son is 12 and I thought they would fit, they do not. They for my 4 year old nephew. I’m so disappointed."
1.0,"I have a lot of piercings and this “titanium” jewelry created a horrible allergic reaction and actually rejection of the piercing site. I waited a year to change my jewelry after my piercing was done and when I received this ring I went to my piercer so he could autoclave it and change it out for me. Shortly after my skin turned hot, red, swollen, has open sores and peeling even where the ring is just touching my skin. I moved the ring up for the pic so you can see where it touched my skin both above and below for some of the reaction it had caused. Ouch!! I ended up having to go back to my piercer to have it changed to jewelry he had in the shop that is actually up to body jewelry standards. He had to drain the piercing site of infection and it hurt way more than the actual piercing!!  My piercing site actually looked and felt much worse after the infection was drained and It has taken five months for the area to heal with the new jewelry in. I do not recommend ever ever trying this one out! I have purchased on amazon and lots of other places before with no issues, but this has me leery of anything except from an actual body piercer."
1.0,The band with fastening pin & band opening are on the same band. Irregular item. Returning it.
1.0,These earrings suck. I have to send them back because both pair I bought look like they were run over by a truck. I will never order jewelry from here again.
1.0,They're too red to see out of. I have other red sunglasses and you can see clearly with a slight rosie effect. These are block out details to everything sadly enough
1.0,Threads on the inside of the sock make large knots so socks uncomfortable for child to wear.
1.0,"Very dissatisfied!!! I'm not a harsh person and I rarely give negative reviews but in this case, I feel the need to speak up. Let me clarify, one size DOES NOT fit all! These will fit a junior's size 0 or 1 and are the same size as a child's leggings! I'm 5'8, size 6-8 and I couldn't even get my thighs in them since the fabric DOESN'T STRETCH, and are very short in length. I'm bummed out since they're very cute. The fabric quality isn't too great but it's what I expected for the price. (On a side note, the studs and leather bands are only on the front side, not the back. I expected it to wrap around the whole leg.) What infuriates me is by the time I received them (WEEKS later) and tried to return them, the RETURN WINDOW WAS CLOSED and now I can't get a refund and am stuck with leggings I'll never be able to wear. Hopefully I can sell them on a Facebook trading site or something. Message me if interested."
1.0,"They advertise free returns, but that it not true! I bought this for my daughter and it was too big. When I tried to return it, the seller gave me the run around and would not send me a shipping label. They told me keep it and gave me less than half the money I spent on it, back. I would rather have sent the dress back and gotten my full refund. Do not buy unless you are absolutely sure it will fit!"
1.0,Hate this I washed this and the color faded ....<br />Don’t purchase
1.0,I did't get the green color shown in the picture. I got dull green. Cheap material and cheap look.
1.0,Disappointed!
1.0,Do not buy this. It is literally made out of plastic and not cute at all
1.0,The color is much lighter in person.
1.0,Fits way to small. You need to order 2 sizes up. I ordered a Large and it fit more like a small/medium.
1.0,De muy mala calidad
1.0,"poor customer service, refused to return item"
1.0,The clasp broke in just a month...
1.0,"I like this brand and have several quality shirts that I love. This particular shirt had severe wrinkles that could not be washed out or ironed out. When I gave up and decided that I could live with a few wrinkles, I went to button it for the first time and the button fell off.  Not happy with the quality."
1.0,I do not like this leggings at all. It is very uncomfortable and keeps sliding down. The sizing is also way off so I returned it.
1.0,The necklace arrived broke and I am extremely disappointed
1.0,not trying to put down product just want manufacturer to know atleast the color black and gray wrist straps are too big
1.0,Is not a flattering style if you carry weight in stomach. Also for any tall girls like me it is way to short.  I’m 6ft 212 pounds. The top looks nice like in the photo but the bottom is not as high grade material
1.0,"I am not sure &#34;who&#34; these right would fit, very tiny and not worth it to return them so may use in a craft project."
1.0,"Do not order unless your waist line is 11 inches across. Ridiculously small.  Otherwise, decent quality for the price."
1.0,Bulky didn’t fit well. Son wasn’t happy with fit. Wasn’t comfortable fit.
1.0,This is so cheaply made that it broke only days after wearing it.
1.0,"Ordered a medium and received an extra large.. Not worth sending back. Also, the stiching is poorly done; it's crooked and uneven. The fabric is much cheaper than it is made to look. Don't buy."
1.0,"They broke 10 mins into the show, hope my daughter doesnt have permanent ear damage"
1.0,broke before I could even put it on
1.0,Shirt fits just at the waist  The image looks as it goes past the waist.  Not happy.
1.0,These run wayyyyyy small.
1.0,simple Scratch the first day and I did not even used them.
1.0,These keep coming off and they're useless. The only thing you could possibly do with these are plate school lunches or wear to pump gas. No way that you could garden with them as the description says. Any additional movement and they're going to come off.
1.0,These are basically pantyhose. The print is cute but definitely cheap.
1.0,Very bad material very bad vary bad
1.0,Poorly made. The buckle came off in my hands when i was trying to take the belt out of my pants. Will never but this brand again.
1.0,"I loved the idea and the style. The quality however, the first order I recieved had poor stitching in the pocket that left a hole in the lining. I discovered this the first time I wore it when I had to fish through the insulation lining to retrieve my car keys. I exchanged it for a new identical piece. When I recieved the second one, before even getting a chance to wear it, I noticed poor stitching in the collar that left a hole exposing inner lining. I returned it because 2 weeks from purchase, I had already been through 2 and only got a chance to wear it once. Don't even get me started on how far I had to go out of my way to return the item without having to pay for shipping. That should be addressed by Amazon or the business that released a poorly made product. Customers should not have to choose from the small list of hubs near them, ups stores, or pay for shipping for something that was out of their control."
1.0,"The quality is cheap. It is very uncomfortable. First the straps are itchy and have scratchy material protruding that irritate my skin. The zippers are industrial strength, functional but very harsh and abrasive. I do not like the suit. I will give it away. Also the size does not fit. I am 5/6 and 100lbs and the small is too big. I have purchased bathing suits from $500 - $5.00 and never had one feel as awful as this one. It is NOT the price. It is POOR QUALITY."
1.0,Fablic is like curtain.
1.0,"The bracelet looks nice at the beginning, but now have dark spotted.  I didn’t recommend it."
1.0,It broke immediately after purchasing.
1.0,I loved the fit in my finger and the the fact that is silver but my second day on wearing it 5 stones were missing :(.
1.0,"IMO this is one of those dresses they would never sell in a store where people can touch it first because the fabric feels super cheap and synthetic. If are planning on wearing this Ina hot climate, then it would be even worse."
1.0,Screw back was stripped and a stone fell out while I was putting it back in packaging for return. No thanks.
1.0,3x fits a L
1.0,"I ordered a x large, it wouldn’t go over my head!! Would have fit my 10 year old daughter!! Cheap, sizing is way way off. Don’t order!!! Save yourself some time."
1.0,"Extremely large, covered my entire face"
1.0,Broke the first time I tried to attach them to anything!
1.0,Couldn't wear long hurt my ears
1.0,"Horrible, it doesn't fit me at all"
1.0,Was very hard to put in
1.0,Flash light doesn’t work
1.0,"DID NOT LOVE. not at all,"
1.0,"This could have been a really great product.  The problem is that it stinks like mildew, and it does not go away.  I tried airing it out.  No luck.  Had to return."
1.0,See through. Disappointment
1.0,Poor poor  quality
1.0,"Size runs large for the skirt, and top runs small material of the top is very thin and fragile easily rips. Skirt is also see through a bit"
1.0,"I ordered this ""sweatshirt"" because my daughter loved the design. It took a long time for us to receive the sweatshirt and I was very disappointed when we received it. Sweatshirt is of very poor quality. I should have guessed it! The price was too good to be true."
1.0,"It sucks bad.. It doesn't work. It's a marketing scheme, it turns your wrist green. It rusted, its a POS. I wanna get my money back but can't cause I threw this thing"
1.0,"It held for about 20 minutes, then my breast fell out of the bottom. I am 38DD. In the comments for the product it said it would hold my size. Pretty and soft."
1.0,Beautiful watch but I cannot wind it up and the seller won't accept returns so bad purchase
1.0,This shirt is absolutely ridiculous. The hole for your neck/head is way too small for any normal size head to fit through. Normally there should be a button or something but there was nothing.
1.0,This wasn't shaped like the image at all. I couldn't get it to fit. When I contacted the company they told me to bend it into shape. I tried to do this but it was not pliable and when I did get it to move it broke. Save your money.
1.0,Really runs small
1.0,🙁
1.0,Disliked the hat because the writing on it was smudged and hardly legible. Bad quality control. Would like another hat with the words “ Chief Warrant Officer” and US Army Retired” clearer and more legible.
1.0,These are not the slippers I order were suppose to be gray and round at the toe I got black and square at the toe and really don't like them
1.0,"First, these run very small and have a very low waistband.  I usually wear a size 8 or 10 in women’s pants, and ordered these in a large and they are very tight on me.  Second, The padding is far to the back, past the saddle area where I sit on my bike seat.  No help at all for comfort."
1.0,The seams are coming apart not flannel like it says. More a brushed cotton
1.0,"This fit was wayyyy too big...the gold color was nothing like the gold on the picture.,.and the sewing wasn’t the best either.."
1.0,"I ordered a medium based on the recommendations based on the waist size. When I put it on, it basically just looked like I had a tank top on, It didn't &#34;Control&#34; anything. The bottom rolls up constantly, and then the worst part... the one seam split a little when I rolled the bottom of it back down."
1.0,"The upper part of this dress that is supposed to cover your breasts, doesnt.  In no way was it possible to tie it so that it actually covered.  The shape of the fabric was all wrong and frankly, bizarre.  Also fabric was much cheaper than expected and the pattern on the model looks much classier than in person."
1.0,"This bracelet is not sterling silver. It is too light in weight.  Saying that, it is a pretty costume jewellery piece.  It is worth exactly what I paid for it.  I am giving it one star because it is pretty and it has not fallen apart in two wearings.  I believe Amazon should pull the incorrect &#34;sterling silver&#34; from the description.  It is definitely misleading.  I did not expect silver so I am not unhappy with my purchase."
1.0,It broke far too soon! I take good care of things and was disappointed it didn't last more than a couple months of moderate use.
1.0,"Picture shows a tank top, but when it arrived, it turns out it’s actually a pack of 6 multi functional mask/headband/scarf things."
1.0,I received the wrong size
1.0,I was so excited to have found the perfect robe for my son. He loves sharks and his favorite color is red. The color of this robe is nowhere near red. It is 100% PINK. Will be returning this.
1.0,Broke after a week of use.
1.0,Came broke. Flimsy but u see red
1.0,This purse looks very cheap and plastic. I returned it.immediately.
1.0,Waste money poor material
1.0,These would be absolutely perfect if they didn't have the silly pocket on the back. Get with the program Nike! Nobody wants that pocket!
1.0,Received defective piece
1.0,"Not as nice as the first ones I bought, they r thinner and less absorbant"
1.0,I ordered the recommend size base on my Amazon size chart.... order a size up because they run small.
1.0,sizes are not plus size. Order 2 sizes bigger. Im a 16 i ordered an XL and i couldnt even get it on. I would have ordered a 3XL which i have never worn in my life. The sizing is WAY off.
1.0,"very dissapointed in the quality for the price. Runs very large,  Don't bother."
1.0,"When I opened the bag, I legitimately laughed out loud. I have never in my life seen a jacket as short as this one. I think the total torso length must be 14 inches. On top of the jacket being uber short, the sleeves are not adjustable at the cuff and are way too large. Highly recommend avoiding this jacket at all cost"
1.0,They are cheaply made. Two of them ripped while putting on my head
1.0,great fit and nice swimsuit! unfortunately there was sticky stuff inside the swimsuit from the sticker and it wont come off.
1.0,"When I received them I was excited but that quickly ended. They looked badly made (misaligned/misglued). I would not (and did not) attempt to wear them. I did not contact the seller, just promptly returned them through Prime. No hassle."
1.0,This is skirt is extremely cheap ! Fabric feels like rough plastic .. smells like vinegar.. the style is completely deformed it’s not asymmetrical.. cheap finishing .. threads are coming out from most of the stitches !! So save ur money .. they don’t even do returns !!
1.0,The shoulders roll up and the quality of the material was poor
1.0,"Bright pink flowers on the soles of brown shoes. Not the best quality, stuffing sticking out with glue stuck over it around the junction of top and sole. Look like cheaply made booties."
1.0,"The chain itself is quite pretty, however, the clasp broke the first time I tried to put it on. Never got the chance to actually wear it..."
1.0,Almost sheer
1.0,Completely see through. Cheap feeling fabric
1.0,RUNS VERY SMALL. I had to return this because the size chart say XL fits 16 to 18 but it was more like a size 10. Would love this outfit if it were the correct size as indicated.
1.0,"I guess you get what you pay for!,"
1.0,"Delivery was on time, but the mask just doesn’t work. Once you put on the mask, the part that  goes over the bridge of your nose goes all the way up to your eyes. The loops on ears are way too small and they pull your ears down. The look is nice, but the concept of this mask is just not working."
1.0,Don't buy!!!! Not true to size.... Very small....
1.0,The top was supposed to have a loner or built in bra and it doesn't and it's totally see thru. Terrible product
1.0,"The are not high waisted as advertised. As soon as you sit or bend over, they roll down. Did the same for my daughter. We are avid legging wearers. These were a waste of money."
1.0,"This is a polyester fabric, not a cotton sweatshirt.  There are no tags on this product; not a size, nor material care tag.  No invoice came with this product, or return label.  I will be trying to return it."
1.0,Don’t buy this purses very cheaply made it don’t even Deserve and star
1.0,"Was so excited for these. They looked super cute and fit perfectly, but had a horrible odor. I let them sit outside for a few days with the hope the odor would go away but it didn't. Unfortunately I had to return them."
1.0,One of the button was missing at the side of the wAtch
1.0,Item states that it's grey and the photo looks grey and black but the item I received was very much brown...
1.0,As I wear this for the first time all of my body became blue and I had to wash myself again. After I washed the towel the wool problem remained and also a part of this reptured.
1.0,So I'm 5'6 157lbs the shirt fits perfect bottoms ran really big on me.
1.0,First off if you want these to last you must wash them and Hang dry them. You can't put them in the drier. Almost everything I've bought that's water proof has needed to be hung dry.<br />I really wanted to like these. Unfortunately they're too big. I bought his size but they would just slip down as he was sleeping. Causing him to just pee on the stretchy part and not the water proofed area.<br />Now he claims their too hot and won't wear them. He does complain of being hot often though so I'm not sure if that's the pants or just a him problem.<br />I would just find something else. I ended up returning mine.
1.0,Not even close to an X-Large. Very disappointing. Gave it away.
1.0,"The dress is too small, Thank you."
1.0,Not a good buy
1.0,"The material is uncomfortable! Itchy and the shape is terrible. I’m an athletic build, busty with hourglass shape and this felt like it was made for someone with zero curves."
1.0,Had to wait almost 1.5 weeks for the hat to arrive to get the completely wrong color (baby blue) and a solid back instead of a mesh back. Hat doesn't look the highest quality either. Very misleading picture.
1.0,This cap is not suitable for men since it is very small even when you fully release the strap in the back.
1.0,"I bought this dress over a year ago and did not wear it until today (just didn't have the right occasion. This dress is adorable BUT is honestly just junk. I never ever put bad reviews on anything but this was so bad I felt I needed to. I didn't wear the dress for 2 hrs and it went into the garbage. The first thing I noticed was the holes in the underarms of the dress (after we had already ate at a very nice restaurant, then after we got out at store and got back in vehicle I felt a lot of air on my butt and was like WTH??? When I got out of the vehicle my boyfriend was like omg its come its ripped or something all down the backside. I was so embarrassed and I did NOT do anything strenuous that could have caused it to rip it is just that cheaply made! Unfortunately I did not wear this dress in time to find this out and return it.... I gave it 1 star because it was at least cute and fit well."
1.0,"loses time...kinda cheap looking...but for the price, what do you expect..."
1.0,The zipper was broken upon receipt rendering the costume unusable.
1.0,"It would be more accurate to call this a swim cap or a shower cap, it is fabric and has elastic to form tight to your head."
1.0,"Very comfortable feeling fabric, however I recieved the dress with a hole in it."
1.0,Everything from the material to the fit was a miss.  Tried it on and returned
1.0,It is not a good product the clasp is not very secure and it falls off your arm. If your not paying attention or can call off your arm and lose your expensive watch. I would not recommend this product at all. It is not secure at all and rotates on your arm even when you tighten the link it is not secure. If looking for a cute band I would suggest another band besides this one. It was a good idea but they need to improve the band a lot bc no one wants to lose a watch due to an insecure band.
1.0,Way too small. Don’t listen to the size chart! Also zipper is on the wrong side. Super cheap think little zipper not lasting very long either. I’m more than a little bummed!
1.0,"While this could be a cute tunic top, the length is not proportionally increased for large sizes. Disappointing."
1.0,These are child size
1.0,"First of all, I didn’t receive the same shirt that was advertised and it’s NOT true to size. Very disappointed with this purchase and I’ll be returning it."
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt. It is made out of thin T-shirt material
1.0,"Both the boots seam along the back are blown out .  Two months into a very mild winter , so they have barely been used.  Son has wet feet ten minutes being in Snow. Ugh..."
1.0,Very flimsy and had to chuck in the trash after a couple months of daily use since they lost all support. These are not heavy duty slippers and expect to replace them every 3-6 months. Not of high quality.
1.0,"Very loose and didn’t stay in place with the simplest movements or bends, returned"
1.0,"Ok...these socks are really nice but I’m very frustrated at the lack of accuracy when filling my order! I ordered a set of 3, navy socks. I received a set of 3, black socks! I was going to send them back but, I figured I’d keep them & order a set of navy socks! Well, I ordered them & what came but another set of black socks! 😡 ( I even double checked my order to make sure I selected navy, which I did.)"
1.0,it broke the second time I use it
1.0,"This just arrived and I haven’t used it yet. It’s not really red- think burgundy. I’m not a fan,(at all! I think it’s ugly 😢), but it’s for our motor home and I need it this week so I’m keeping it."
1.0,It took my son a week to break it.
1.0,One of the aprons had profanity included in the printed words. The words are not as shown in the picture. It is offensive and I would not have ordered it if it was accurately pictured.
1.0,Too small not even close to the size ordered & I ordered 2x bigger than I usually wear
1.0,The shoes are cool.... but they started to peel in less than a week after I purchased them..
1.0,"The product page previously stated that sized up to 60&#34;, which is not correct. When I measure it has 54&#34; exactly which would only fit 50&#34; confortably."
1.0,The “diamond” fell off literally 2 months after purchase
1.0,Beware-read the fine print. If it mentions the Comfort Waist it doesn't fit at all for a normal 36 x 32. There is way too much material in the front and the back/butt seam rides up and is very uncomfortable. I highly recommend the regular waist pant (UB Travel pants).
1.0,I did not like how ruffles looked. If there wasn't any ruffles would have worked out just fine!
1.0,"The shoe in hand is Gorgeous. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because their version of a size 9, is more like a size 7. Remember there is absolutely no give, so you cant break the shoe in. They don't carry half sizes and they only carry up to a size 41 - a supposed 9 but like i said, it fits someone wearing a size 7."
1.0,I returned this item. Pour quickly fabric and make.
1.0,These are super hard and cont comfortable at all! I returned them.
1.0,No where near a junior medium. Would have to size up at least 2 sizes. Headband not included.
1.0,Came broken. Straight to the trash it went. I am so glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it
1.0,"This is a cheap shiny material very polyester or maybe even something cheaper, not typical sweatshirt material.  I’d almost sat it’s not what’s in the picture."
1.0,"I bought them in rose gold and they have quickly become my go-to earring for everyday. I have very sensitive ears, so earrings often bother me, but I basically don’t feel these at all. Putting them on the first time was a bit of a challenge, as my earlobes are pretty thick, but once I got the hang of it there has been zero issue. The added bonus is that the back doesn’t stick out or anything, meaning there is almost no way hair/scarves/whatever get caught! 10/10 would buy again.<br /><br />*Update*<br />After wearing them quite a few times over the past few months it seems the coating has worn off entirely, and they have developed some sort of green “rust”. It irritates my skin so much that my ears hurt for a day after wearing them, so I can no longer wear them at all. Very sad about it, I really loved them."
1.0,Was a cute ring while it lasted but then started to tarnish and turn my finger green.
1.0,Cheaper looking in person also a logo over it you can't see
1.0,"Very disappointed !  I only had my cell phone and chap stick in the pocketbook and the strap came off of it.  It was not sewed on, only hot glued and I had to carry the shell part the rest of the day."
1.0,This was supposed to be 5X. It was maybe a xl. No tag to give actual size. Just a sticker on the bag it was in.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c42dd57edef9281720515b5379aea6de]] The bra stinks! It's dirty, stained, and too much fabric is loose on the cups. The straps are dirty. Clearly this is USED. I'm beyond disgusted! This is unacceptable."
1.0,The placement of the button that changes the lights is right on the ankle area of the shoe. They are so uncomfortable for my daughter that she cannot wear them. Would not recommend.
1.0,"These were listed as &#34;wide-calf&#34; compression socks, but the socks I received did not match that description. I own several pairs of the nursemates wide-calf compression socks and love the fit. The socks I received this time were obviously not wide-calf as they slide down my legs all day. If I hadn't already removed the tags, I would've returned them."
1.0,Fell apart in 3 months
1.0,"Very short and material is very thin, made to be worn as a pajama shirt"
1.0,"poor quality, cards do not fit properly."
1.0,I wanted for the summer to wear with jeans
1.0,"I ordered these and when they arrived, the third pair (pictured last-the hoop-like ones) were missing. I was looking forward to those so this is pretty disappointing."
1.0,Made for a ten year old not a woman. This did not even fit my daughter which is a size 2.
1.0,"Odd.  I purchased two of these Kenneth Cole Reaction Slub Knit V-Neck shirts - both small.  When I received them, they were indeed both labeled as small.  Unfortunately, the concord grape colored version was far from a small.  At $12.99, I guess I'll just consider this a loss."
1.0,"I ordered the same size I usually order, I cannot zip the back machine, style very different with what you see on line, if possible to return it because it is not the dress I will wear or even give to a friend"
1.0,All of them except for one doesn’t light up at all my girls were happy except for one
1.0,[[VIDEOID:179974edfce72185b97f17be829d65b4]] Es un engaño este short no cambia de color NO LO COMPREN
1.0,"Ordered this hat from Jeff & Aimy through Amazon. The hat didn't fit and the style didn't suit me, but when I went to return it I found that I would have to pay the return shipping to China that cost more than the hat. If you buy this hat don't expect to be able to return it."
1.0,The tanks are very thin and runs small.
1.0,"As other reviews have mentioned, the backs are flimsy. I loved them while they lasted but they quickly fell off and got lost."
1.0,Wanted to return but wasn't worth it!
1.0,"Poor quality, even for this price"
1.0,Not at all what is pictured. Looked like a handkerchief. Very thin and see through. Do not order.
1.0,"There were no instructions included in the package so in trying to guess how to change the length, I think I broke the belt because I can't figure out how it works."
1.0,These DO NOT have screw backs like indicated in the description.
1.0,"Sweater was missing all the “e” in Styles, so it says Styls.  It was a Christmas sweater so didn’t get opened til it was gifted. Really embarrassing and hopefully they still like it even though they didn’t complain but did point it out as it is missing letters."
1.0,Beautiful dress but polka dot  fades too quickly after washing. It looks old and faded after one wear. Do not recommend the polka dot version
1.0,It so small and ugly I even throw mine away
1.0,Ordered a big size and still was too small.
1.0,Break very easily. Bad quality.
1.0,"It was nasty. It was made of like a papery cloth material and got dirty so fast. Not worth the money. There are better, cheaper ones at Walmart."
1.0,Would like to send it back
1.0,I should have known better....🤦🏾‍♀️
1.0,I purchased the X-large thinking it would be big enough.The picture was deceiving it doesn’t go past the waist and i am a short person.
1.0,the wallet falls apart  fairly quick
1.0,Don't waste your time....go to local store to try on
1.0,"cheaper than I expected, and took a long time to get here."
1.0,It’s so small it seems like it’s a chocked for toddlers
1.0,"Item not as described or pictured. I ordered the light pink, what I got was brown."
1.0,This is a necklace. Beautiful in picture. When it arrived it looked nothing like picture. It was huge and the smaller beads were not real turquoise like the picture. Very disappointed. I sent a message to the seller and never heard back.
1.0,The product did not perform as stated. It would slide down my head very often.
1.0,"The words make no sense. What is Bool? What is EEKL?? What is a Caks?? This could've been cute, but it's made by someone that cannot speak English."
1.0,I ordered size XL and the shirt fits my size S sister .... very disappointed in this product.
1.0,Cute but runs extremely  small.
1.0,"Got the largest size. Put them on, and the thumb ripped out before I even closed my hand. Asking me to review reminded me I have to file for a return on them."
1.0,"The material was very light and see through! I got a size M and I usually wear a S, but the M was way too tight and shorter than I expected. Had to return."
1.0,Very abrasive material not soft at all :(
1.0,There was a tear in the back of these leggings that I didn't realize until someone else saw it on the first day that I wore them.<br /><br />They are really cute & the material is soft. I hope to get a new pair quickly.
1.0,Did not look like picture<br />Ugly ill fitting
1.0,"I have yet to decide if I trust that these are actually plated with real silver. They feel like plastic to the touch. I sized on my fingers where I wanted them to fit before purchasing. I sized the rings when I realized that they only fit on one finger where I wanted them to go. They are not a 4. They are all a 3. Very annoying. Even if they were the correct size, they would not be worth the price at all. Only positive is I got them quickly."
1.0,Not even as advertised I got a trash wrist band completely not worth buying
1.0,"I don’t like it you can see through it and it’s tight around my boobs area, I was going to wear it when I get married but I can’t do that now"
1.0,Size was to big
1.0,"I bought 2 watches, one as a replacement and NEITHER work.  Bought this as a gift for a very very sweet 6 year old and he was over the moon and now he's crushed.  Don't sell a product if it DOESNT WORK!! I'm so upset for him and embarrassed I got him all excited only to see him disappointed:( listen to the 1 star reviews"
1.0,"The zipper broke within 7days of purchase,  I would not recommend this item."
1.0,"Broke the first time I used it. The inside zipper broke and will not close. Also, I know it’s a small purse, but doesn’t fit a regular size wallet, 5 inches or so. Disappointed but glad it wasn’t too expensive so I am not out a lot of money, but still frustrating."
1.0,I was expecting something a little more elaborate. There’s one speaker wired to the Bluetooth receiver and button system. No thanks.
1.0,Stiff necklace. Earrings not as described. Can lose easily. Wore once.
1.0,"This is the thinnest and worse material ave even seen,intact the fabric is a joke. The seller is very wicked for putting out this trash in the market just to rip ppl off. Please do not waste your time here or think of buying, cos I’ll have to return it immediately"
1.0,Sent wrong size and zipper was broken.
1.0,"I was very excited to wear this, as I ordered it according to the measurements. Unfortunately it was way too small."
1.0,"This necklace is really horrible. It looks like it came out of a quarter machine at a shopping center. You can't even read the initial on the pendant because of the way the jewels are set. The chain is so short, and it looks cheap."
1.0,very poorly made
1.0,Way to small and tight for me
1.0,this items runs extremely small
1.0,"Bent and they feel maybe 99 cents. I buy a lot from Amazon, but this was not worth the money. Save your money. Find a better pair."
1.0,"Too plain, not at all like picture"
1.0,"Concept is good, very cheap materials"
1.0,Not working. I still got electric shock even after wearing this
1.0,Broke within mins. Nothing special.
1.0,I loved the look of this top but it fits weird in the underarm/chest area. Its somewhat see-through as well which I was not expecting.
1.0,"Wasn’t made properly, neither of the 3. Cheaply made! Don’t waist your money"
1.0,What a joke this is!!! This is basically enough for a cellphone and a small wallet. What a waste of money.
1.0,Tore the bottom part of the shoe off within a month... Want a refund!
1.0,They slip right off the stems of my glasses.
1.0,"If I could, I'd give it no stars. The material is awful, not sweatshirt like at all, the gems are all off and it looks nothing like the picture. Very disappointed."
1.0,Material wasn't the best
1.0,Medium size 36d size 11 Jean . The bottom fits my ( bottom) but droopy in the front . I ordered a medium. First of all the top is cut to the point it’ll look good on no shape . Will not buy ever again. I purchased the black finesse out fit similar issues . A waste of Money unless you are a seamstress
1.0,This tank does not fit well. The area under the armpit is very loose and says open/down. I ca only wear this with something over the top-good if you layer.
1.0,"Cute hat.  Fits fine.<br />After less than 10 wearings the adjusting velcro straps on both side of the opening in the back are breaking away from the seam that is falling apart.  Am not hard on hats and have many.  There is normal wear and tear, which is not the cause of this failure.  This is lousy workmanship.  Cheap construction.  Fortunately I know my way around a sewing machine so will probably be able to repair it."
1.0,Purchased as a gift and was pretty small and very thin material. Ended up returning
1.0,I bought these gloves for my nine month old the eyes came off immediately and he went for the little red nose after that. I had to try to cut that off for fear it to would come off and he’d choke on it. These were definitely NOT made for little ones who still put everything in their mouth. Otherwise these gloves were super cute!
1.0,This product is extremely thin it is cheap fabric and not knit or wool. It's not warm at all and it's only printed on one side The other side is white. Very disappointed in it I mean for the money I guess I should have expected that but I didn't
1.0,Absolutely horrible. Construction is so poor the zippers broke before I could even leave the house. Unfortunately  I didn't use it for the first month after I received it and thus was unable to return this piece of garbage.
1.0,Order a few sizes larger
1.0,"I could probably fit these on a Barbie doll, but she'd be uncomfortable."
1.0,"Terrible quality, ball fell off screw on first day."
1.0,It is not worth the price paid.
1.0,I thought the product would hold you in more but it does not. The zipper ripples. Not eye appealing.
1.0,The description was for MEN's Nike running shoes so I purchased a Men's 7. When they arrived they were a WOMEN's 7 and I had to return them. Very disappointing!
1.0,"This shirt is butt ugly. The material is weird and stretchy and it’s very wrinkled. Just an ugly shirt. Very loose fitting, and I’m 7 months pregnant"
1.0,"looks nothing like the picture, terrible, do not waste your time or money."
1.0,horrible fit
1.0,The product came and I’m very disappointed!!! I really want to love this product but it’s been tampered with!!! It’s been either used and repacked or just simply used and shipped it to me. Fingerprints all over the screen! And hair inside the plastic!
1.0,Material is not skin friendly
1.0,"I mean, if you feel like lacing about 64 eyelets, then these are for you. Trust me, IT WAS ANNOYING! The fit was meh. Overall, it's cool/trendy but the downside is definitely lacing them yourself! Also, it did not ship withing 2 days (for Prime membership). It took about 2 weeks! Nope just nope."
1.0,I'm 5'4 140 and I really wanted to like this shirt but it is very low cut and loose at the neck and arm pits and very snug around the waist.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"Cheaply made, Tore in wash machine"
1.0,I ordered this for a costume not expecting to love it but it is so bad I'm returning it
1.0,The watch stopped working very soon.
1.0,"I am so disappointed in this product. It’s not a sweatshirt, it is more like slightly thicker T-shirt material. And the word “chocolate” is spelled wrong. Also, I ordered an XL so it would be oversized and comfy, and it is very wide but too short for me, so the fit is strange and not at all how it looks in the photos - you can see how square and boxy it looks in my review photo."
1.0,the chain broke as soon as I put it on and the hook is broken
1.0,There is zero busy support and I can’t even pull the straps over my shoulders because the suit is so short in the torso.
1.0,"This item is much thinner than I expected and it's bigger than I thought it would be.....And, the thread around the bottom of the sleeves started to unravel during the FIRST wear, after about 3 hours!! It's cheap, just like the price! I would NOT recommend purchasing this item....next time I'll spend more in hopes of getting a better quality item."
1.0,It was too big and does not have any shape even with the sash
1.0,I bought this thinking it would fit my daughter who is a size US 14. It fit me which I am a size US 10.
1.0,Not a trucker hat as told it sat flat...and the netting in the picture looked white it is a light grey not what I expected I will be returning
1.0,Ordered a small looks like a man's small way to big!!
1.0,"Just 12 hours after my kid opened it, a button broke off and, after bathing with it, it stopped working completely."
1.0,Not type of fabric or fit I was looking for—sent these back
1.0,"It was very low quality, wayy to big, and not worth the price at all. I was very disappointed"
1.0,"Those are super cute but I had to return them, the post are very short. My seven year old granddaughter loved them but they didn't fit, who ever heard of that!"
1.0,They are not true to size and see thru
1.0,NOT leather - very thin STRETCHY plastic
1.0,When I received my earrings all the stones had fallen out in the back post were bent down
1.0,"Very hard silicone and although it looked pretty at first, within one week the flowers are peeling off!"
1.0,Not much to say just disappointed<br />It also smelled bad
1.0,Product arrived torn
1.0,The color grey's were different
1.0,"Material cheap and see through. Didnt fit right, immediately returned. Not recommended to buy."
1.0,WASN'T PERFIT FOR ME JUST DIDNT LOOK RIGHT.
1.0,Cheap don’t purchase tin type of metal flimsy.
1.0,This runs a little big for the size I wear.
1.0,"Run small. I would have given less stars, but could not. They are not as soft and comfortable as the white ones I ordered."
1.0,Too small And not true to size it all.
1.0,The size is ridiculous.. the top would fit a newborn and the bottoms would fit a 2 year old.. cheaply made as well
1.0,Look good but fit small.  The threads are already coming out of the slipper.  Not good quality.
1.0,"Just didn't work for my industrial.  It's the only bar I've ever had an issue with.  It bled when I tried to get it in, and just didn't fit, so I never got to use it."
1.0,Too large. I don't think it is appropriate to call it a clutch!!
1.0,The shirt is several sizes too small. I ordered large: Arms and the shirt itself was 3-4 inches too short. The quality looked good.<br />If it would have fit I would have given it 4 stars. I returned the shirt.
1.0,Terrible quality.  Was very tight in chest so you could see through the elastic strings that are used for button holes.  Terrible quality unless you want to see straight through the dress.
1.0,I would never recommend this product. Very thin & not quality!
1.0,It looks more like a mitten then a boxing glove . The chain was nice .
1.0,They break way too easy and snag on everything!
1.0,The heel makes noise when you walk
1.0,"Order at least 2 sizes larger. Very wrinkly thin material and small, not for curvy women for sure."
1.0,"To small, very thin fabric"
1.0,Flowers fell off
1.0,Cute top other than the big hole in upper arm sleeve.
1.0,I opened up the package unfolded the jeans unbuttoned the rivet button and it fell off in my hands. Didn't even put them on. Very disappointed.
1.0,The bottom of my &#34;Amy&#34; boots split on the pattern lines of the sole of the boot causing me to only be able to wear them when it is dry outside. I didnt realize they split until I went out in the rain and my feet go soaked.
1.0,Got a large and am 36DD...it was huge. Gave it away
1.0,"It’s kind small, it’s not cute at all, and arrived damage . Returning for sure !!!!!"
1.0,"Very thin subpar material, also runs at least 2 sizes too small. Beware! Mine goes in the return box tomorrow."
1.0,"After four washings, heel came off.  Too late by then to returning."
1.0,"this is very cheaply made, it also took a long time to arrive. buy it from the real brand not the cheap knock off. the jewels are plastic and the chain is very cheap and brittle. this may sound a bit harsh but my daughter was so excited because she bought a green one from the real company and was very impressed with it and thought that this would be no different. it came in a cheap plastic bag and the silver metal was flat like a sheet of paper. i thing most of the money is for shipping so in reality this is worth one dollar. Maybe it was just me who received a bad one but i highly doubt that."
1.0,These Capri Legging are not a one size fits all....
1.0,These hats are 100% useless.<br />IF the tabs were cut correctly so that you could put them together without a major fight and IF you could get the self-cut string into the tiny little holes (yes... it's one long string) THEN you would have a tiny little hat that is slightly larger than a credit card.
1.0,Came so big it fits like a oversized blanket .....extremely disappointed
1.0,"The fit was good, purchased XL and normally wear size 16.  The dress came missing a bow on the front pocket so I can’t wear it, bummer!"
1.0,"So tight arms, I couldn't wear it. Returned.  So sorry, because it's beautiful."
1.0,"Please, I beg of you, don't order this or anything that uses this same picture under different sellers. It looks absolutely nothing like the picture, it's really small has short arms and a short torso, and the turtleneck is just awful. The knit was scratchy as well.  It put it on and couldn't get it off fast enough. I got a refund, but I noticed that there are a ton of sellers using this same picture and probably providing the same awful sweater.  If they really made one that looked like the picture, I'd love to buy it, but that's not this."
1.0,These hurt my kid's ankles. They can't even wear them.
1.0,Was so disappointed when the jumper arrived…The fabric is see thru and is not the outfit that is shown.
1.0,The fabric is very itchy and uncomfortable. Also the sweater is very boxy and unappealing.<br />This arrived without tags and seems to have been used.
1.0,Looked crazy in these. Some blogger had them on. Too big for me.
1.0,this is not what I had thought it was  its  to heavy for me
1.0,Im giving 1 star because they are not true to size. They look awesome but they didnt stretch my ears.
1.0,The watch didn't work as soon as I took it out the box. Battery was dead on arrival!
1.0,Intensive shimmery and glittery...it feels lyk they made this for circus play... Cheap And see-through
1.0,No me gusta que te dicen que la entrega es rápida y sucede que tengo que esperar casi 2 semanas por la entrega
1.0,The stone that clearly looks like a rose in the picture doesn't even resemble one in person. It's merely a blob... very disappointed ☹️
1.0,Terrible 5 clips have already broke.I ripped 1 of my ties because the clip wouldnt come off
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c43195759e017f23fd9c62e6cb0e7b45]] My item that I received was damaged one of the crystals was not in the cuff link it was inside of the box I need a return before Thursday. Or a refund
1.0,Just put it together and already the links kinked up.  Not very impressed at all.  Don’t waste the money bc it bends so easy.
1.0,"Pathetically ill-fitting/looking jacket. Awful, just awful."
1.0,The white is not white. It’s more cream colored. Definitely not what I wanted
1.0,IT broke the first time my friend had the chance to wear it
1.0,This item was an awkward fit. It was also very long; it wasn’t suitable for me so I returned the item.
1.0,pictures indicates scarf is large but is only a little head cover
1.0,Flimsy.  Too tight around the middle.  Too big on top.  Really wished the fit was better.
1.0,Not even the same print or fabric will be returning
1.0,Chain was broken I was gone send it back but didn’t have time I work too much
1.0,These have a zipper.
1.0,It was broken when I opened it so I never got to wear it
1.0,"I never got to snap a photo before I returned. Just know the image on this hoodie is of the  LOWEST quality. It looked like a sticker was just slapped on it. Parts were starting to peal off and the whole image was wrinkled and looks like as soon as you washed it, it would start to crack and fall off! Sadly the hoodie the image was put on was super nice soft and fuzzy. But no way was I going to give it as a gift just because the hoodie felt nice. The image was just too jacked up!"
1.0,Retuned.  Cheaply made.  Reminded me of the type of fabric used in the past for ppp plus sized women.
1.0,It’s was very thin material.
1.0,"I bought this for my Disney World trip because I didn't want to invest in an actual rain coat and I figured at $9.99, this would be a little bit sturdier than the dollar store brands. I liked that it was large, long and had pockets. Unfortunately it split down the seam in back of my arm within 20 minutes of wearing it in the rain and I had to throw it out. It looks like it is a manufacturer's malfunction. I make purchases from Amazon (long time Prime member) nearly every month and this is my first bad review. I am disappointed that Wealers raincoat coat couldn't make it a day. Even the Disney saran wrap looking rain cape survived without ripping."
1.0,Not good enough !!
1.0,Flip flop broke at tie strap only after wearing a few times
1.0,Gave these as a gift.  All have holes in the seam. Very disappointed
1.0,"The watch looked good, but did not fit my wrist.  Might be fine for a child, but not most adults."
1.0,I thought I was getting a pair of earrings not just one what am I going to do with one earring
1.0,Edit: The glasses broke even though I've used them for less than 10 hours total.<br /><br />I was excited to use these because after work me and some buddies will play warzone for a couple of hours. I usually find it hard to sleep and have some eye strain. After using these for 4 hours straight i honestly do not feel bad or eye strained. They dont mess with your vision either as they are clear and not yellow. I would definitely recommend these.
1.0,"I love the design and the feel of the watch except the hands of the clock are not properly aligned with the hours like at 9 o'clock the hands should be at 90 degrees. Also only the time setting is easy, the day, month, and especially the year is difficult to figure out. I don't think this watch will last long."
1.0,This sweater looks nothing like the picture.  I sized up 2 sizes to get a loose fit but it's more of a turtle neck and much shorter than expected.  It also took over a month to get here.  I do not recommended this sweater.
1.0,As a person who has POTS theey didn't offer any compression. I returned them.
1.0,Do not buy this shirt if u r a plus size...I ordered a xxl and it will fit my 12 year old that's a twig...very disappointed
1.0,I'd suggest buying a larger size; these run really small.
1.0,Not the Quality I want on my NEW expensive Apple Watch
1.0,Too small. The watch was made for small wrists. I gave it to my 17yr old niece.
1.0,"Product came packaged nicely. However, lenses are significantly thinner than the originals.  Install was was easy enough and the lenses appeared fine so the thinness of them was negated. The reason for two stars is that once I tried them on they seemed nice until I looked straight ahead and found a distortion in the lense that made me feel like I was crossing my eyes. I had my wife try them as well to confirm and the distortion gave her a headache. Product is poorly made and/or quality checked."
1.0,I didn’t like the material and it ran big
1.0,"The skirt had a Large tag, but was not a large at all. It was a small. I could barely get it over my knees. However is was super cute. I gave it away to a coworker."
1.0,"IT WAS TOO BIG, RETURNED IT."
1.0,All of the tools were not included in the kit.  Have been trying to return this item.  ANY help would be appreciated.  Thank you.
1.0,"The belt length options didn’t come in the size I needed, so I bought it long with plans to cut to length.  The buckle was very difficult to open and broke when I tried to release the strap.  I guess you get what you pay for?"
1.0,"It broke only after a couple weeks, and the silver anchor tarnished horribly! Says &#34;stainless steel&#34;, but stainless steel DOES NOT tarnish this bad, this quick!"
1.0,It would have been nice to have instructions on how to put the laces in.  I know I don't have them on correctly but I didn't have anything to go by.
1.0,1000000000% not what you thought you were buying. Color is completely different than advertised . Returning ASAP
1.0,Strange material not an attractive fit for me
1.0,Did not fit and unable to wear. Could not return because too late not sure what to do with it now. Disappointed
1.0,So disappointed. NOT a polarized as it claimed. Returning it :(
1.0,It is nice. It runs small on the cup.<br />It's  a nice bra for a young thin person. If I were younger I would have a bunch.<br />Worth the money. Very cute.<br />Older or larger women  I wouldn't suggest.<br />I'm D mostly DD 36 because of stretching.<br />55yrs finally learning how to size myself.<br />So cup is small. Bra is lovely.
1.0,The sleeves on the coverup does not look like the picture.  They are like fishnets.  I ordered an XL but it is way too small.  I do not recommend buying this product.  I am disappointed.
1.0,These shoes are huge!! I bought the 0-6 months in hopes my baby could wear them at 2 months old. They look like they may fit when she is two years old!!
1.0,"The material is not good for printing tee-shirts, it takes several tries before the transfer stick to the material, which cost money."
1.0,"These do not have the ball end as stated. I thought I received the wrong item, asked for a replacement and got the same thing again. Returned both items"
1.0,It shrinks after wash.
1.0,"Ordered with sparkles , came without , it was totally plain"
1.0,I am 5 feet tall and got a large and i absolutely can't wear this in public. It looks like a maternity shirt.
1.0,"The blue and white striped shorts romper is made of a very stiff material. I ordered a small; The top was too baggy and didn’t sit right, and the waist was small (which did fit... so it was kind of disproportioned). Also, I am 5’1” and the shorts are very, very long and an awkward length. It was very unflattering on. I will say the company was going to allow me to return it but it was going to cost a bit to send it back so I gave it away. If you buy this, make sure to get it on PRIME with free returns because it is an odd piece of clothing that may not fit correctly."
1.0,"I wasn’t sure I liked this but for the price I was going to keep it. After washing, the criss cross got all tangled and stretched."
1.0,"It was way too small package was ripped when It arrived and so was the hat, very disappointed"
1.0,This outfit was very cheaply made and the sizes were not true to the measurements. Do not recommend buying
1.0,"Good looking watch, not stainless steel as description, send it back"
1.0,"I ordered two of these dresses hoping one would work for an outdoor summer event - the light blue floral and the orange round flower print. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing either of these in front of my dog, let alone out in public. They were frumpy, cheap-looking, and completely unflattering. The round flower print is not meant for anyone with any sort of chest - the flowers across my chest were enlarged, stretched and distorted because I am not flat as a board. They were SO heavy, and not all the type of material you'd want weighing you down in the summer."
1.0,Item arrived and it was used and smelled like perfume. With a stain on it.
1.0,"Cheap clasps difficult to close, refund money please"
1.0,Did nit come with a heating battery and seams are out before even being worn.
1.0,I have used Anywears for the last 10 years. They were great. The new version is billed as being lighter....it is...and it breaks down within a few weeks of wear. The product is clearly not what it used to be. I would like my money back...they are not inexpensive.
1.0,The actually size is smaller than stated and it is not stainless steel....never ordering from these people again!!!!
1.0,It is not as pictured. The sleeves are very different and it is not an off the shoulder.<br />The pumpkin and lips on the front of the shirt is a cheap vinyl iron on. Its already cracking. Do not waste any money on this shirt.
1.0,I bought a size 14 for my 10 yr old who is very average size and it wouldn't even go over here head..
1.0,"The sweater is as pretty in person as is in picture. Unfortunately, it arrived smelling like someone took a few too many hits from a joint. Amazon needs to monitor employees better."
1.0,The watch stopped working after 4 months of use..
1.0,"I hated the material and they were WAY too small. My husband is a small 34, so I ordered him a 34, and he could not even get them zipped. I was excited to find pants in a 36 long, but these were not worth the money."
1.0,"I was very excited to get this necklace because I dont really have much jewelry, but it turned out being a large disappointment. The color was not like the picture at all. It was a cheap, dirty-looking gold, the bow was half the size that I would've guessed it to be, and the flower was a deformity, making me question if its actually a flower. The whole necklace screams cheap, and I guess that's I get for expecting a bargain for such a low price."
1.0,These were too thin. I returned them.
1.0,This looks wide. But it's real narrow like a belt. No what we expected!
1.0,We ordered this for my wife who wears a large. We ordered 2x and it took her both time and money to buy additional fabric and straw to make it usable.
1.0,It is not a sweatshirt.  It is not warm.  Do not buy this shirt.
1.0,"Terrible, all the color came off the pieces just sitting. Terrible quality"
1.0,"I not blame you, i wasn't careful enough myself.<br />I wanted to make a present to my boyfriend by an alike copy of Doctor's watch, i wanted watch made from iron or something like that, not just a plastic toy for children.<br />But as far as i remember there wasn't any detail description of this thing, so i couldn't know that they are made from plastic, moreover it looks quite different at the picture, not like it's in reality.<br />So i'm terribly upset and dissapointed as i've already promissed to him a great wonderful surprise by the New Year.<br />Well, anyway it's already done, so.."
1.0,This item arrived pre-worn and with “residue” on it!! If you are the person who returned it on 1/25/19 shame on you!! I own several items by PB and have never had this experience. Totally disgusted!
1.0,"Feels like it is a costume.  The material is cheap, the lace was not as pictured (it's gold- I was expecting it to be off-white), and the seams/edges are very visible on the shoulders."
1.0,"fabric is okay, fit is too loose."
1.0,"I ordered this necklace for my daughter that lost her support dog. She suffers every day without her precious girl. I ordered from a Prime account well over a month ago,  and have yet to see it. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Very cute slippers.  My daughter loved them until the sole fell off after wearing them for 5 minutes. I am pretty sure they were never fully sewn together. They also seem to run a size or 2 smaller. I returned them and bought something else.
1.0,"Wish I could give it zero stars, absolute garbage"
1.0,These were very cheaply made.
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress, the pictures are so pretty.  I guess you can't believe everything you see.<br />I order from Amazon way too much and always read the sizing chart.  This company has their own, I guess they live in a different world. The dress I received whatever size ( there were no tags not even at the back of the dress to tell you what size it was or which was the front or the back of the dress) is not as pictured.  The material, it feels like paper and the elastic is sewn in so tight even if the dress fit it would cut off the circulation around your arms.  Do not be deceived by the pictures. I never leave reviews just soooo disappointing."
1.0,The yellow is too yellow .
1.0,even though  is my size it's extremely big<br />I WANT TO REUTURN IT..<br />.PLEASE ADVICEP<br />PATSY MARTINEZ
1.0,Too large .:( . It doesn’t fit . I order x large but they gave xxl.not happy
1.0,Pants are super thin. The shirt is a nice quality.
1.0,The size I needed isn’t what showed up and these don’t fit
1.0,"I realize this was an inexpensive purchase, but the fabric and detail on this jacket are pretty awful."
1.0,This are cute looking bracelets and seem to be a good price but three of them broke within hours of putting them on. To contact the company to get replacements.
1.0,Very disappointed at the size of the chain. When you look at it on line very much so bigger. It gave me a different vibe when ordering Jewelry off line with Amazon. Very disappointed. Did not see no diamond cut in the necklace ripe off as it stated and showed.
1.0,"They fit and are comfortable, but the material is cheap.  After only washing 3 times the material starts to run.  Very disappointed."
1.0,It's a horrible fit. It's to small up top and not even and then the bottoms are way to big and one leg is wider than the other.  Definitely wish i would have tried it in before just hanging it up in my closet. Such a waste of money.
1.0,This dress is a piece of crap! Thread already coming apart when i open the bag. It to cheap to send back for a refund.
1.0,"It looks nice but unable to wear it. It is too large, doesn't fit well even after trying to adjust it -pinch it smaller."
1.0,Color didn't really match the picture.  Very flimsy feel to it.  Dont feel that it is of high quality.  Should of been 1/2 of what I paid for it.
1.0,"Literally would only hold glasses and a phone.  Not big enough for makeup, credit cards, money, phone, and a little brush.  Had to return."
1.0,Lying about what it’s made of. Bad look.
1.0,"This is very cheap, it broke within a few days!"
1.0,Band broke in less than a month.
1.0,The stitching  failed at the pins and the watch fell off. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"This sweater is falling apart, and I haven't worn it yet.  It isn't even worth a dollar .  Wow I won't make this mistake again."
1.0,"Hoop is way larger than I like. They bend very easily, which is not a good thing."
1.0,"This glows really cool but impossible to wear, there is no way to breathe through it."
1.0,"When I opened this bra I was super excited.  Finally a bra that has all the main features.  Beautiful, well made, comfortable, and no back fat.  The way this bra is made is similar to the  S O M A bras but better IMO.  This one is more supportive and wouldn’t stretch out due to the supportive stitching on the back.  Also sized true.  I’m a 36C usually and that is the size I got.  So why did I give it 1star then?  Because it gives you POINTY BOOBS.  I mean that was all the rage back in the 50s.  But we’re past that (thankfully).  So in the photos I’m trying to show that.  The way this bra looks under a thick sweater.  Even under the thickness of sweater you can see the “twin peaks” effect—a lot more obvious in real life when not trying to pose for a selfie in the mirror.  I’m usually far too busy to write reviews.  I guess I decided to write this one because I really see the potential here.  I’m hoping that the manufacturer will take this feedback to redesign this bra. And when that happens—I will be buying dozens of these.  These need to have a redesigned cup.  With built in foam and rounder shape.  No sewn seam cups because that’s what gives the pointy boobs effect."
1.0,Material was very bad and I ordered the smallest size however it was soo big
1.0,"I went ahead with few of the good reviews and bought this item but to my surprise, it is exactly opposite to good. The quality is cheap and does not worth the buck. Moreover , the design on the pictures is quite different than what is delivered. stay away guys…"
1.0,"I got these to wear for my bday because they looked cute, I’m 7 months pregnant so wasn’t doing anything too cumbersome, and they weren’t very expensive. As soon as I opened the package the felt on the back of the earrings were dirty. Should have been the first sign of not to wear them.. Anyway i finished getting dressed get in the car and the earring falls out of my ear. I put it back in. I get to my destination get out of the car and the earring falls straight to the ground. I pop it back on immediately flies off and now a backing is completely lost.. As a woman it’s very frustrating to have your whole outfit and jewelry together and then have your earrings not work and you don’t have any backups with you. Oh, I even tried switching the backing.. I had a friend bring me different backs.. Still fell right off my ears. These are heavy and not worth the amount of money plus the felt (yes, felt!) on mine were dirty.. save your money!!"
1.0,This is a poorly designed uber cheap watch cover and band.  Do NOT recommend purchase - find a different solution.
1.0,Did not work...came right off
1.0,Wore it for about a week and the diamond fell out
1.0,The material is not what I expected. I will return it
1.0,Not regular earrings
1.0,Very very bad product
1.0,"Looks like a linen material online, it is more like a very cheap satin. Also the print of the material on Amazon is all wrong. It was more like vertical lines."
1.0,Chain is too short and pendant so small and lightweight. It would fit a child.
1.0,Was super happy when I received.  Two weeks later bag loses its handles.
1.0,Item looks cheap and yellow NOT white or cream. Returning asap!
1.0,"I was so excited to gett it in the mail butt as soon as I opened it, it was broken in half I didnt even get to wear it or anything might not be thatthey sent it broken but still very heart breaking!"
1.0,"Bought the black and red. The red came off on my skin and stained. I did wash before wearing. Warning, the color does bleed. Horrible product."
1.0,Comes unzipped. Broke after the second time I wore it. I had surgery and had a month of recovery. Now I have missed the return window time. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you want to zip it up over and over and have the zipper break.
1.0,"I thought this was such a nice watch for the price but alas, you get what you pay for.<br />Setting the time for the first time and the minute hand just broke off! Didn’t even get a chance to use it first! In the photo, the minute hand is between the 12 and 2. Waiting for refund."
1.0,"So they are exactly as pictured and whatever. However, the shipping was ridiculous. They came in a bubble mailer. So a lense was popped out. It doesn’t matter hownice a product was when it left the warehouse if it comes broken."
1.0,Item was clearly worn previously. It had no tags and a strong smell of sweat. I can’t believe this item was sold.
1.0,Soooooo ugly nothing like the picture<br />I had to donate it and it took forever to get here
1.0,It had a fuller shape and pockets
1.0,I ordered my usual size and it was hilariously small. Couldn’t get it past my chest. I would say size up 2-3 sizes but they don’t go past an XL.
1.0,I found the actual dress online. Just saying...
1.0,Terrible. Mine broke in less than a month. I wore them only a few times too..
1.0,"They're cheap in appearance.  I have long hair, so I wasn't that concerned.  I wore them the first day about 8 hours. My ears were a little itchy.  The second day my ear lobes were red and itches like crazy.  Not happy"
1.0,Washed once and the XL size shrunk to medium. Not happy with this purchase
1.0,Did not like them don't know why thought they were crocheted knit caps put them in a drawer and forgot them did not like at all to large didn't look right at all
1.0,Seems it has been worn before and someone stretched it out. Going to return.
1.0,Belt looks cheap and it's not very easy to buckle
1.0,"This buckle is NOT for your 2 1/4 inch duty belt. It is too small!!!! I now have a worthless buckle - seller did not specify, and I ASS-U-MEd.  I did not realize there was more than one size, and the seller listed nothing about it."
1.0,"The placement of the cups in the bathing suit is off. Also, the rear rides up pretty bad."
1.0,arrived incomplete and defective. a credit was issued.
1.0,Es muy pequeño
1.0,"Despite claiming to be ""Suitable for size 28-48 waist"", this definitely does not meet those parameters. It did not even fit my size 42 waist. If I had to guess, I'd say the maximum waist sizing for this is closer to 38"" than the advertised 48"". A full 10 inches off can't really be claimed as an honest mistake, so I definitely think there's some purposeful deceptive advertising here."
1.0,its a gimmick for sure.  does nothing except pop off my ear at very inconvenient times.
1.0,"Very small, i normally wear a woman's s/m so i bought a large so this would be big and comfy. It fit like an xs so i'm returning it."
1.0,Did not like it looks like a blanket more would. Not wear it to go out
1.0,"The material is cheap, like a giant iron on. Also ordered a small and it was like a large on me. I’m 135 lbs 5’6” and it was liber than in the picture."
1.0,It took a very long time for this shirt to arrive and when it did I was very unhappy with the quality.  The material is almost shiny and the fit is very odd. I went to return it was it has to be mailed back from the post office which is more of a hassle. Usually just go to Amazon drop off. I would not recommend this shirt
1.0,Material was so thin and flimsy. Don't bother buying or you'll be sorry
1.0,The most uncomfortable bra I have bought! Size runs large. The clasp is so low down that it causes the top of the underwire to stick out and is visible through short. I returned it.
1.0,"Lots of length and can be easily cut - just make sure you use a match to melt stray strands after cutting. HOWEVER, the buckle has a sharp edge and is already cutting into the bottom edge of the web belt. This is very common with this design.  Update 1/1/18 the buckle does not hold the canvas belt in place and the end is constantly popping off. Would not buy again."
1.0,"my item is lost , i need return my money please"
1.0,"cute leggings, glad they aren't see through, but on both thighs the seams are just falling apart, thread coming out and leaving holes on each outer thigh. very disappointed, only wore once."
1.0,"The size chart is way off.  I bought an XL--and i'm a 10-12 normally -- by no means even came close.  Also really cheaply made and material was ripped at the zipper once i went to go try it on.  SO poorly made both by construction, material and  sizing is way off.  Don't bother!! Sending it back!"
1.0,They are not true to picture. Much much darker. I am returning.
1.0,I wear a large but this large arrived as an XXL. It was a square shaped shirt. Nothing like the photo on the model. I returned this.
1.0,"Poorly made. Had potential, but the light line is barely glued on and unevenly set. The cable to the controller ripped from the helmet the next the day. The whole reason for the this cheaper version was for the light gimmick and it's no longer an option after one night. I didn't expect the best quality, but I also didn't expect it to break in one day. Stay away."
1.0,Charger stopped working!
1.0,They are really bend  like they smashed it with something really heavy lma so disappointed
1.0,Clasp broke so I am returning it for refund
1.0,No me dejaron nada<br />No ha venido el artículo ya van dos veses q asen lo mismo
1.0,I ordered this before and loved it. I ordered it again as a gift but thecone that came this time was different.  The pendant was much larger than before and the part that goes around your neck is bulky and uncomfortable. I’m very disappointed. Not sure why I didn’t get what I ordered the first time.
1.0,"Very poor quality, thin material and buttons snaps open easily, ordered before in May and June were much better quality"
1.0,tried it on to find stains on the strings! Also very body fit and not flattering at all!
1.0,very tiny graphic that is difficult to see.  Not worth purchasing.  Advertised pic is deceiving.
1.0,"Cheap looking, like plastic!"
1.0,Beware! The skirt tag says 100% polyester.
1.0,"I loved the idea of this summer throw on jacket, but the 2XL purchased was too TIGHT in the chest, too SHORT above the knees, and too TIGHT across the waist. For reference I AM what some consider ""athletic"" built: 5'9"", 170 lbs (36, 33, 38). I ended up regifting this jacket to my neice who is petite built: 4'10"", 100 lbs (32, 28, 30)... She's loving this as a quick cover up. I purchased both Black and White and my niece has been enjoying both❗ 🤪"
1.0,"I wish they just said Asian size XL then I won't waste my time and money to order this,<br />I asked the seller for fabric for me to fix the small armholes but never hear from them.<br />Beautifully made but size is not for US market."
1.0,"I regret buying these glasses. My son does not wear them- it changes the colors on his iPad screen and they are difficult to see through. I should’ve purchased the clear or yellow lens, that might’ve worked out better. The orange lens is too intense and interferes with his viewing."
1.0,This watch is off by 4 hours per day. Pain in the neck. Avoid!!
1.0,Ripped to easy and they were not warm enough.Bad purchase
1.0,"Sadly, came way to small (and we bought one age year up.  My son loved it but it hurt to take on an off so we had to quickly retire.  By multiple size up ."
1.0,"I was excited to get this necklace, because my nearly 5-year-old son and I both love unicorns and the unicorns of the sea, narwhals. I received the necklace today and have already printed a return label. In person, the necklace looks like a swordfish fighting a slightly smaller swordfish. A baby narwhal and it’s mother this is not! So disappointed!"
1.0,Ordered small and they slide off had to alter to keep them on
1.0,These are stolen pins and stolen artwork from Girly Pop Bows!!!! Please do not buy fakes and purchase from the real artist!
1.0,"Snapped them closed and they opened, would not syay closed. sent them back"
1.0,"Not for ""regular"" house sized keys. These are for long keys like the length of skeleton keys. Waste of money."
1.0,"I think if they were the right size they would be just fine, I normally wear a size 10 so i'm thinking one should order a size larger than they wear"
1.0,Mouth covers the whole face
1.0,"Got these for my 5 year old son, he was so excited to try them unfortunately they are defective. Only one charges fully (to green) the left just flashes red as if charging no matter how long its plugged in. The result is a VERY short time of illumination. Maybe 15 minutes then it's out. Very dissatisfied and disappointed"
1.0,Defective<br />Waste of time ordering this product
1.0,I Returned my item and it’s been weeks since I got my money returned. Good item but customer service not very good and is inconvenient if you order something that doesn’t fit by accident.
1.0,Its horrible won't stay locked. I had it pop open twice first time I thought it was me not shutting it. Unfortunately the second time lost my charms including a charm from my grand kids. Don't put anything valuable to you in it.
1.0,This sweater is not 90% cotton. It is 100% acrylic and super cheap feeling. Sent it back.
1.0,"I didn’t even get to wear this because I washed it once and it shrunk so badly it was way too short to be worn as a dress. It was fine before I washed it. But if you do purchase it, would recommend hand washing and hang drying to avoid shrinking. Fabric is somewhat thin, but it wasn’t see-through or anything. Wouldn’t recommend for the price, I would have returned this item but missed the return window. Waste of money :("
1.0,Ok. The band needed to be trimmed to fit. Not happy about that. The color of the band looks good.
1.0,I think this sweater was previously owned because it REEKS of perfume or fabric softener. It gave an instant headache and it’s not the kind of stunk that’s gonna wash away in one or two washings. Will be returning!
1.0,Bought three colors.  Hate them all for the cheapness of the material.  You can see outlines of seams and pockets.  What a waste of money.
1.0,It arrived with pieces missing.
1.0,"My little granddaughter is sitting here with me and I just asked her why she wasn't wearing her new jellies I bought her?? She's only 4, but very smart, and said they broke the first time she wore them!!! The strap broke and the flower came off!!! Purple is her favorite color and she loved these shoes when I showed them to her, so surprised her by sending them to her in the mail...what a total letdown!!! I've bought similar shoes and they've lasted longer than 1 DAY!!!! Save your money!!!"
1.0,laces appear to be thinner and sleeker in the picture but what I received were chunky thick laces that look like ribbons little girls would wear in their hair. so pissed..waste of my money and time
1.0,The lenses were loose in the frame. The frame was flimsy. Good shades but quality is sorely lacking!  Can't recommend them even for the money.
1.0,"Even though I ordered this in a large, it is still small, the length does not match like the picture does, tried to attempt to put on the shirt and the next piece doesn't even fit it's way to tight! On the side of the shirt it was slightly torn! HORRIBLE! NOT SATISFIED!"
1.0,Tiny. Returned.
1.0,Very small in the bust area.
1.0,Size up!!!!!!
1.0,Lost them both in the same day and the first day I wore them. They came unscrewed way too easily and fell off.
1.0,Very small nothing like expected
1.0,Not the color it says in the description. The material was made my skin itchy.
1.0,Product didn’t fit well and it hurt my nose. Not a good buy.
1.0,This is not 925 sterling silver. I did not read anything about it being plated. The silver has war off and I see copper. Granted what do you expect for under 5.00.
1.0,"The watch is nice, though this retailer won’t answer questions. It came running, which is alarming for a quartz piece. Also the second hand misses the marks every time.<br /><br />Edit: the watch stopped working after less than a year and less than a few months of wear. I’ve never been unkind to it but out of the blue the second hand started skipping all over the place. This is pretty unacceptable at this price point."
1.0,It came in the mail looking like someone sat on it all day
1.0,"Remember, this product is made in China and sold by a Chinese company.  The LARGE size sold  for this item is actually for a 30 inch waist.  It might be wise to pass this up if you actually wanted this to actually fit."
1.0,Mala calidad y la forma de la hat es extraña
1.0,"run EXTREMELY SMALL, cheap quality"
1.0,They squeak very noisy. Seems like the soles are cheap made.
1.0,Very thin and poorly made. Any critter can easily bite through this.
1.0,"I purchased this band in August and have only worn it a few times, this morning I noticed it was broken… had to order a new Band from a different company. Also, the Band does not match the Rose Gold I-watch, but it was so attractive thus the reason why  I kept it… until today.. It is not longer wearable!"
1.0,The calves are so tight we can't get them on so I need to return them.
1.0,Not at all what the picture shows.
1.0,"I like the dress very much BUT,  the seams pulled apart. The seams need to be reenforced with stronger material."
1.0,Way longer than expected
1.0,"I had it on for just a couple of hours and one of the bands broke! Not worth sending back! It is super cute but doesn't last, not even a couple of hours!"
1.0,I only got the skirt! I can't believe I didn't get both pieces. What a waste of money!!!!
1.0,The dress does not look as pictured.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Buy something at Walmart or Target. They shrink after 1 wash and all 3 of them got holes in the fabric after a couple weeks.
1.0,Se demoró mucho y la verdad la talla no es la correcta el color fue diferente ..y la tela muy mala calidad 😔
1.0,Lenses do not fit my Bolle 527.  Not even close. And I have to pay shipping to return them
1.0,Bought a small it’s labeled S<br />It’s so big my daughter can fit her and two friends into it.
1.0,I received my order and it’s not true to size it would even come up my thighs I order an XL
1.0,"This purchase was a waste of money for me,i bought this suits after reading some good reviews about it. I bought 42R which is my normal size,somewhat large and doesn't fit so well, I was hoping for a slim fit but that isn't the case.  Very poor material quality,its feels like an ancient suits of the 1960s. My advice,buy a good quality no matter the price not a cheap low quality like this one."
1.0,Giant hole for neck and no room for shoulders terrible buy. Returned immediately
1.0,Berry disappointed!! Picture showed pearls on this well it’s not!! Looked like something my husband would out scrap material from his tool box!!!!😡
1.0,Inconsistent one side just right other very toght
1.0,Poorly made lousey material too big to wear too expensive to return to China!!!!
1.0,The belt broke the first day it was worn. Waste of money.
1.0,I ordered these pants twice and both time I got the wrong size. I’m beyond frustrated. Don’t recommend ordering.
1.0,"I returned, it looked like a scrub top"
1.0,"The dress is adorable. Buuuut, the string for the bow was ripped on 1 side. I ended up having to cut it off because I needed the dress for an event that morning. Smh. It was still cute without it though."
1.0,"So disappointed...the first time I tried to put them on, one of the earrings broke.  They were cheap looking and cheaply made."
1.0,Not even real wood. Cheaply made & will be sending it back.
1.0,Love the skirt itself! Size is WAY off!!!
1.0,Package was completely destroyed and taped together. One of the pairs has a security tag on them and is extremely dirty.
1.0,These glasses let a ton of air get in my eyes and these have a terrible hot spot on my ears. Would not recommend
1.0,"These pants are just plain weird. I did not realize but they are not soft joggers but more like stiff work khaki pants with tight elastic/rubber bands at the bottom....not for me, returned.  Also it took the seller almost 2 weeks to refund me and they have horrible reply to inquiries.  They did finally refund me but I had to contact them way more than I hoped.  Thank God for tracking receipts with confirmation. They tried to say it was not returned but delivery confirmations don't lie and they were forced to refund me. I wouldn't buy from them again or just hope no returns"
1.0,Don't order!!! These rings are  pieces of junk!!
1.0,Beautiful bra but fits strange and uncomfortable.  It's like both my boobs are meant to be centered in my chest and my boobs are not made that way; maybe other countries women are. I love that the sides are wide and It does fit but tight for a 40C. I plan on returning and going to Walmart.
1.0,The thing turned black the second time I wore it much like cheap silver jewelry does.
1.0,"When I adjusted the band, it wouldn't lock lack to together."
1.0,The pearl separated from the post. I purchased two pairs (for my twins) and they both had the same thing happen. They're garbage.
1.0,I’m a medium and the large is more like a small.  Plus the material is as thin as a baby’s onsie.  Sent all 4 back in one package but only 1 shows up as refunded.  The 1 Star is for the colors. They are pretty
1.0,en lo personal a mi no me ayudo con mi dolor
1.0,Broke after one day
1.0,Don’t liked
1.0,Very “giftable” in the way that it was apparently taken off my porch.
1.0,Worst experience.
1.0,"Do not buy, looks like a t-shirt with lines on it."
1.0,too small for adult unless you have two holes on each ear. One of the earrings would not stay closed
1.0,the top was WAAAAYYYY too small. I'm rather busty anyway so I bought an extra large and wasn't able to fit my chest in it. super frustrating.
1.0,It wouldn't close around my wrist so I ended up giving it to my teenage sister instead.
1.0,"Lasted two weeks, and even then, it was a problem every day. The stem would not wind the watch and the completely failed. When the second hand came off, I threw it in the trash. Never again will I buy any watch from this company."
1.0,These are too small! They don't fit and I actually ordered a half size larger than needed.  The slippers are cute but what does it even matter if they don't even fit.
1.0,"I returned these. I am not sure the material is even cotton/linen. Very cheap, will wrinkle easily and show underwear. Poor quality."
1.0,Quality of the material is not what I expected based on what I paid for the product.
1.0,"Clearly stated on package disposable, not cotton, made in china. Falsely advertised."
1.0,They are not red they are orange. Waste of money!!
1.0,"Purchased the ""green stripe"" version for a swimsuit cover-up and it's so ludicrously short that I had to give it away. In the product photo, the front hits at about the model's mid-thigh, and the sleeves hit between her elbow and wrist. Well, I'm 5'9"" and the front of the cover-up didn't even reach the bottom of my swimsuit; the sleeve didn't reach my elbows. So either that product photo is seriously photoshopped or the manufacturer has changed the cut dramatically. I notice that the other color/patterns appear much shorter than the one I purchased, so I assume they're all about the same size. IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT, LOOK AT THE USER-SUBMITTED PICS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE. They're much more accurate. It's basically a transparent shirt. I gave it away to a shorter friend."
1.0,HATE
1.0,Not for crocs had to buy other charms for crow being that these dnt have back pieces 😠
1.0,This runs way too big. I bought the same thing in black in the same size and the gray color is at least one size bigger - but labeled the same size. I just missed the window of return by a few days and I'm now stuck with a piece I can't use. Unhappy
1.0,Cheap material and runs small. You pay for what you get. I ordered two in different sizes and returned both.
1.0,The cuffs do not look like the picture and neither does the fabric.  Save yourself $8.
1.0,The image with the legs on the body on the back do not align with the torso. See photo.
1.0,Arrived grayish in color and clearly discolored. Disappointing. ):
1.0,Looks cute but definitely runs small
1.0,"Photo is deceiving, I thought it was a dress but it's a shirt with a long train. I didn't send it back because it took over a month to receive it."
1.0,"This was a gift for my daughter, so I almost left the outfit in the original packaging, to wrap when I got to her home in Portugal. Thank goodness I decided to not only open it, but to try it on. The jacket was a good fit and warm enough. I then tried the pants on and discovered two gaping holes where the pockets should have been, rendering the whole suit unwearable. Either the pockets were just not attached, or they were hacked off. Obviously there is no quality control. If a replacement doesn't arrive in time, there will be one less birthday present for my daughter. I'm disgusted with this retailer for their blatant disregard for their customers."
1.0,"This shirt is probably two sizes small.<br /><br />I have about a 46 inch chest, and I could barely get the the front to touch.<br />Buttoning the shirt was not possible.<br /><br />Order BIGger than you think you would need if you were wearing a vest under this shirt....."
1.0,I took this bag with me on the trip the sewing start to break apart. We had to carried our thing by hand.  Can not trust this product.
1.0,These have black stones in them not purple like the picture AT ALL.  If you hold to a bright light you can barely see purple.  But they are black when you wear them.  Disappointing!
1.0,Not even real hoodie material. I waited a month for this weird polyester hoodie/shirt. I would return it but it doesn’t even seem worth the hassle.
1.0,ordered an XL and its a small.  Still unable to return it
1.0,"Very disappointed with this “dress.” According to other reviews, it was supposed to be fully lined and it wasn’t. I purchased this in the white and it was COMPLETELY see through and the fabric was staticky and itchy. Poorly made product - DO NOT BUY. Zero stars."
1.0,Very nice.  Cute!  Only meant for a person with small calves.
1.0,"So unfortunately, I just looked at the star rating and the image and looked no further.... if you are under a size 10 and/ or have no big curves. Then this dress will look great. The pockets are placed so if you do have a have hips or curves it puckers oddly. This dress also looks nothing like the image."
1.0,This outfit is ok
1.0,"Bought this February 20. Unfortunately waited a few days before putting it on my watch because it broke just after a few weeks. And of course past the return date of March 22.  I work at a desk. I was not doing anything crazy, active etc and it broke. Do not recommend buying!"
1.0,Turned silver within two weeks
1.0,Material was ok. Thought there would be more street hawkers to the dress but there wasn’t. Very small at the end of the dress. The top was smaller than expected as well. I’d go up a size
1.0,"Product arrived with broken left ear. frame.  Looks nice, but cheaply made"
1.0,Runs extremely small. I'm an xl on shirts and I bought an xl it fit me like a L does. Extremely tight
1.0,Although they fit the foot the cotton is nowhere to be found. It’s completely polyester or nylon.
1.0,The fabric is completely different than it looks. It looks like it has the same fabric like the other shirts that they sell with the solid patterns (I have about 15 so I know what they feel like) and it’s not like that at all. It’s ugly and gross and I hate it!!
1.0,These clearly come from WISH. They're shipped from China. They are cheap felt and look nothing like the picture. Mine had two squished flowers in blue. Did not look anything like the photo. I'm rather craft and couldn't manage to make it look good. I trashed it and made a mental note to see where items are coming from before order and where the seller is located.
1.0,It's a piece of crap. Cheaply made. Doesn't even work properly. Not even worth sending back for the money. I just threw it away.
1.0,Right out of the box it’s almost ripped in half.
1.0,Contacted the company about the battery not charging and never got a reply.
1.0,Material is light but it’s a shame the image is awful<br />Usually ok with faded rustic look but this one is NOT flattering<br />Returning 😐
1.0,"I was so looking forward to wearing this, however, the ends absolutely DO NOT thread correctly.  Looking at it initially it looked cross threaded, but I found that it's just wonky and will not thread properly or tighten.  The bar is fine, it's the bead and trident head that are messed up.  Truly disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,"bought a 3xl, it fit like a medium."
1.0,It does not look as good as the picture here.  The one I received looks like an used one. I received today and will return it immediately tomorrow.  I am so disappointed with it.
1.0,"The material is super thin and awful. This will not be usable after 1 month, I'm pretty sure about it....<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.,,, The ones at Walmart are wayyyyyy better quality and also cheaper than this one!"
1.0,Came quick but when I tried to put them on the arm fell off completely broken
1.0,Very cheap non stretch fabric. Does not look flowy like in picture. Returning
1.0,I purchased this watch to have a nice watch to wear. Auto wind but after having the watch 60 days it has stopped ticking. Not a good investment no recourse to address my issue.
1.0,Only received 50 pieces don't buy
1.0,Lenses fell off the pair of sunglasses and they came in a paper box with no case. The pictures showed a case.
1.0,It arrived and it was washed--B 4 I wore it.  It pilled so bad that I was unable to wear it  It was BAD---I had others that were perfect  but this is NOT.
1.0,Very thin. Ripped easily.
1.0,"UPDATE: Changing to 1 star instead of 2 star rating. If I could give it a 0 I would. I got an email from this company ASKING ME TO CHANGE MY REVIEW. The guy tried to say that his boss was going to deduct his pay because of my bad review and that he has a family to support. We all have families!! Which is exactly why I can't afford to spend $40 on your LOWSY jacket. Maybe if they had offered to send me a better replacement jacket but it still wouldn't change my opinion on this product. So not only is this a horrible jacket but the company is sneaky and manipulative.<br />I had high hopes for this jacket. There were some really good reviews so I gave it a shot. Very disappointed. I ordered a size large but it fits more like a medium. It's extremely short...if you lift your arms the jacket is going to ride up, which is something you don't want happening in the winter. It's very, very thin. I find it hard to believe that this jacket would keep anyone warm. MAYBE in the spring time. Plus it has a weird smell to it. Not worth the money. Will be returning it."
1.0,"This top runs really large, and is not flattering on"
1.0,"I know you get what you pay for, but the watch looked nice online.  It ships directly from China so delivery time was long.  I knew the band would be cheap (and it was!), but for the price I thought I could replace it with a nice one. However, the watch dial is so large it looks like a clown watch! I guess if you have a fat arm and willing to replace the band it might be okay, but I tossed it!"
1.0,Way to small. Not even close to fitting. And smelled like smoke when I got it.
1.0,"Very cheap, feel cheap and look cheap.  These literally feel the same as the 3D glasses you would get at a movie theater, I’m not sure how they’re being sold for more than $5.  For $25 I expected a lot more, get some cheap $5-10 gas station glasses instead, they will be much better and even if these do float, they won’t last a week of normal wear so you’ll have to buy new ones anyway.  I understand they have to be light to float, but they are narrow for like a child’s head.  I have a $200 pair of costas (definitely didn’t expect near that quality but a lot better than these), and bought these as a backup boat pair."
1.0,Ill fitting very rough material
1.0,"Sad! Color not as represented- orange is BRIGHT ORANGE. Both earring posts arrived bent. They are in fact very heavy. And worst of all, they are not returnable."
1.0,Really heavy
1.0,"Definitely not 100% cotton per the label. Horrible fit, very poorly made."
1.0,I knew they were going to be small but these a minuscule
1.0,Very low quality silk screening or iron on graphic.
1.0,First of all they run too small and you need larger sizes and more colors so people have more of a choice in your products
1.0,The bow fell of every hat. i had to sew them back on
1.0,The shipping was fine but we did not expect half the item to fall off within 3wks of my wife putting it on. Very poor quality item.
1.0,"Super tiny and not proportional at all. The arms are WAY too short. But don’t worry, you won’t be able to put it on...the arms are also so skinny tight...you’ll never get this thing on. The body...it’s BOXY! Like a square pattern was used to cut this out. If I could squeeze into this I would guess that it would hit around the top of my hips or at the top of my pants. No where near where it should in either case. The neck! The neck is NOT off the shoulder, it’s not even a boatneck cut, barely a scoop neck...look, if you manage to get this piece of work on, PLEASE do not attempt the one shoulder look, this could definitely cause bodily injury to your neck."
1.0,this was open and had dog or cat hair on it
1.0,Runs super smalll. Has zipper in back so you need someone to help you and it’s microsuede mateerial
1.0,It came a month late and I received it broken. I’m very sad because it was supposed to be a gift for one of my friends for her birthday!!!
1.0,Leggings were too tight and definitely too see through
1.0,Wasn’t happy with this . It’s smaller than expected and shinier than the picture
1.0,keeps sliding off the nose...pure junk
1.0,Too big. Its just a piece of see through fabric cut with a scissors and stitched together to form a neck band. Falls off face. Made in China.
1.0,Was not very good quality it was tarnished inside.
1.0,"WAY to small, says size XL but fits like a small/medium!"
1.0,Not a great quality and not what I thought it would be. It came ripped and I threw it away!! Not worth sending back!!
1.0,"You may want to go three or four sizes up on these.  I tried on the XL, which is my fit for labels like LL Bean and Eddie Bauer, and these were comically small.  My wife, who wears a women's medium typically, also could not get into them comfortably.  Poor design, poor sizing, poor quality.  Should not really be offered on Amazon, or anywhere else for that matter."
1.0,It was beautiful and I was happy with it but haven't even had it 3 months and it broke and fell off somewhere. I just had it decoratively hanging from my Michael Kors purse and haven't been rough with it or even handling it regularly like a set of keys would be. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,They were to tight for me.
1.0,Not at all how it looks in picture!
1.0,Terrible company
1.0,Product came broken
1.0,Really disappointed with this purchase. Looks nothing like it does not the model it big around the stomach.
1.0,The design of this shoe is terrible. Can’t zip up entirely and your feet will get wet and stay wet forever. Avoid this product at all cost.
1.0,"top i too small, bottom is too big"
1.0,I wish I had read other reviews before buying these. I ordered a large and they were more like an extra small or a kids large. I laughed when I saw them. It's funny how small they were.
1.0,"This is definitely unwearable. It is ridiculously big, and not referring to ring finger size but rather the actual shape of the ring. Don't waste your money. If it wasn't so cheap I would send it back for a refund but it isn't worth it."
1.0,"Tight fit, plastic, and overpriced"
1.0,Way to small suited a small child not an adult. Wanted to return sent an email no response at all throw it in the garbage where it belongs..
1.0,I didn't like the material are the fit
1.0,"Too small, not comfortable."
1.0,"It’s literally a T-shirt dress. I had hoped to wear it to work since it looked like a sheath dress. But nope, it’s a T-shirt."
1.0,Washed it one time by itself on gentle and layed it flat to dry. It faded and practically fell apart and I couldn’t wear it again. Sent it back
1.0,It is much shorter than the picture shows and not fit to size. It is thin material and not what I thought it would be! Disappointed!
1.0,not a lg6
1.0,Mala calidad no es lo que esperaba
1.0,Was not the correct size. Looked like it was made for a child.
1.0,I didn't even get to wear them and they broke
1.0,I ordered the largest size (XL-3X) and it was too small to adequately cover my head and face. For $29 I think they could throw in some more fabric.
1.0,Fit is fine. The color is way off. Pastel with white background not darker with black background.
1.0,Really Cute But Ruined My Skin Left PAINFUL SORES & BLACK MARKS On My Nose So Ugly & Noticeable
1.0,"I am not satisfied with this hat.  While the design and embroidery on the hat is well done and substantial, the hat material is very thin.  Additionally, the sticking is unacceptable.  There is a section about 3 inches long where the bill of the hat attaches to the top of the hat that looks like the stitching is pulled apart.  I was looking forward to getting a couple more of these hats, but after seeing the poor craftsmanship, I will not buy any more, and I wouldn't recommend this hat to anyone."
1.0,These are not the correct nose pads for Bolle sunglasses.<br /><br />I asked and checked 3 times before I ordered them. Bolle direct now says they have no replacements. Typical.
1.0,Popped off all the time and eventually all where lost in a matter of days.
1.0,Ordered red and received yellow
1.0,The threads on the front are not sewn on properly it didn't fit right and I was confused on how to tie the back
1.0,I got something completely different. It had NOTHING to do with the Blacklist.
1.0,My necklace was a gift for my sister for Christmas saldy the chain has no clasp. Too late to mail back.
1.0,"Ordered a large because that’s typically what my 13 year old wears, way too small. Returned and got an XL, still too small. Not going to attempt to try again. The second set of shirts also had a lot of fray going on. Even if they’d fit I’d still return them for not being good quality."
1.0,Does not connect to the watch making it unusable. Very poor quality. Avoid.
1.0,"I received the package quite quickly but have a real problem. There are multiple loops for the watch band and a tool to use to fit them. However, there weren’t any directions. The tool is two-ended and has multiple bits in the package and I have no idea what to do with them. Really stupid not to send instructions."
1.0,Feels like I have a satin sock over my face.... not breathable at all.... (and I’m well versed in wearing face masks).
1.0,Very cheap turn colors within two days
1.0,so small you can hardly see it & way to small for the price ... could have been a much better product.
1.0,Shirt is way too small skirt perfect
1.0,This dress is cheap and the material is cheap not good it don't deserve one star
1.0,This one to long
1.0,It has a corset but the part where your arms go was way to tight. The dress was really long and to puffy
1.0,"Thin material and I could literally hear the elastic pulling when I first put them on. I’m pretty average sized, not large at all. Couldn’t believe how cheap these are made. Color are print were very pretty. Disappointed that these weren’t better quality."
1.0,Bad quality material came in with a hole in the seam I will be returning
1.0,"Might like it if it contained instructions, otherwise not much use."
1.0,I wash it...it is built like a square...Not the way a blouse should and wrinkled. Not happy at all with product . Will probable never wear it. Fabric is rough.
1.0,The magnets are not strong enough to hold in the nose. They just fall out.
1.0,"I ordered my usual size , product was WAY too small.<br />Was going to use it for golf"
1.0,This item is WAY too big for a child. It would fit an adult.
1.0,One size fits small and maybe a medium.
1.0,Only 3 months old and it’s falling apart. Nothing heavier than my cell phone and the strap broke. While trying to fix the strap the clasp broke.
1.0,Very pretty but unfortunately poorly made. It broke after only having worn it 3 times. I was very disappointed because it looked very good on me.
1.0,I am a 36DDD and a size Med was too loose. The thin elastic at the top is too thin and weak and I felt like the dress would slide down. The rouched top also look akward.  eturned.
1.0,The color is nothing the same. It has white flecks of fabric stitching mixed in with the burgundy. Bottom edge is very cheap looking and it is see through.
1.0,They literally only sent 1 umbrella cape and nothing else and it easily broke. It was too late to return as I opened package late.
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress as my husband and I have a couples trip planned for later this week. I read all of the reviews and saw that most people said this dress runs either true to size of even a slight bit large. I was stoked that I was going to be able to have the perfect “tiki dress” to wear to our favorite tiki bar. I normally wear a size 16 blouse/top but decided to order a xxl(20) just for extra bust room.<br />Then I received the dress... I can zip it past my waist, but when it comes to the bust the dress will not budge. For a dress that was supposed to be two US dress sizes and one Yeokou dress size larger I would have hoped it would fit. Sadly we leave tomorrow morning for our trip and won’t have time to get anything else delivered before I leave.<br />I hate to leave a negative review for such a pretty dress, but buyer beware the size chart is WAY off. If you are anything close to a plus size girl I would stay away from this dress."
1.0,"I was really excited to get this piece. Other reviews did mention it was small but could be adjusted. Even after adjustment, the L bend made this impossible to get into my nose. I gave up after 10 painful minutes."
1.0,Too small and I got a size up from what I wear.
1.0,Too small and very cheap looking.
1.0,Terrible.<br />Cheaply made<br />Damaged when they got here.
1.0,My arms could not fit in the sleeves.  Had to give it to my friend.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I don't usually write a review but I bought two pairs and the first pair broke the first time I put them on and the second pair broke with in the next two days. I know there not top quality but there comfutable and I expected to get more use out of them.
1.0,not even close cant even try on its so small worst purchase ever
1.0,This product is awful it came a month after I ordered it and the clothes smelt like plastic and had a very strong stench so I decided to hand wash it in the sink and let it air dry turns out it shrunk completely and I can no longer wear it.The price is so cheap but the quality is awful i do not recommend
1.0,"I ordered 2 of them, loved mine and gave one as a gift. The stone on my necklace broke in half after worn a couple times and found out that the cord on the one I gifted broke.  I ordered another one months later because I thought maybe it was just a fluke the first time I ordered but the stone on that one also broke after a couple of times worn. Love the necklace it just does not last."
1.0,It’s just a standard tank.  And it’s extremely short. Do not wast your money.
1.0,"Horrible quality. Other people's reviews had me thinking the quality would be ok but it wasn't. 1st thing my daughter said when I put the widely oversized shirt on, was &#34;Owwww mommy. Owwww!! Take it off!!&#34;  It was horrible. Also, I didn't know I ordered a super sized shirt and super sized shorts with a waistline of a tiny baby doll. Don't buy. Huge mistake."
1.0,Great just missing the belt could wear it with out it!!
1.0,"I was unable to receive my item, so I requested a refund. I was looking forward to this skirt, as it's lightweight and has a pretty floral in it. I hope I will have different results should I purchase from this company again."
1.0,"The first time I ordered this item, I received shiny red size 9.5 stilettos instead. Customer Service tried to fix it, twice, and each time I received shiny red stilettos. No Easter shoes for my daughter. Disappointing."
1.0,Washed by hand in cold water with Black approved laundry soap. Smells like plastic scratchy. Took 3 weeks to get to me. Would not recommend. Going to use it to dry my car.
1.0,comfortable just a little big.
1.0,This hoodie was very small and design looked dirty/poorly done.
1.0,Died after 9 months. Worked well until it didn’t. Too bad I can’t return.
1.0,"Mask looks nothing like what is shown in the pictures.  It's thin cheap feeling plastic.  The holes for the nose are somehow in the moustache. Complete garbage.  It is also claiming to be NONREFUNDABLE.  So if you want to be disappointed and waste $10, save yourself some time and flush the cash down the toilet. It'll be better spent that way."
1.0,Pay Attention. It is patterned and not in a masculine way.
1.0,Recieved wrong letter on necklace
1.0,not at all windproof but it does cover my entire face. Not recommended for bike riding
1.0,"Very poor fit, quality, and feel.  First one I took out of the plastic had a stain on it, others found to have defects inclusive of ripped pockets, and other abnormalities.  Stay away from these, not worth your aggravation..."
1.0,"The sizing on this is WAY off - unless this is a toddler Sasquatch.  I ordered a 9 toddler and it is HUGE.  He won't be able to wear them for some time.  And I ordered purple, but got orange.  Nope."
1.0,"This is definitely made for short, very very small breasted women."
1.0,"Waist too small. I mean way too small. Like a size small waist. I couldn’t tell you how the pants fit as I couldn’t get the waist up over my hips. I dislike that Amazon advertising shows ‘adjustable strings’ to loosen or tighten the waist. When there is a wide, tight elastic waistband sewn in. What’s the point of ‘adjustable’ if it doesn’t actually work? These go back."
1.0,"Yes, I read the reviews. But I was just praying I'd get a good one. Unfortunately I am not. The hat was shipped in a box that it couldn't actually fit in. So they just taped it so the hat wouldn't... fall out, I guess.  No bubble wrap, tissue paper, nothing. The hat is completely unwearable. I'm at a lost for words. Pics below :-/"
1.0,No es nada parecido a la foto que muestran es tres veces más grande hasta el gorro es gigante
1.0,"bad quality, I should have listened to the other reviews. It was sewn incorrectly and completely unwearable. Disappointment."
1.0,Not skinny jeans can’t fit and bottom part to big
1.0,Had to send it back. Loved the color but the sizing was way too small.
1.0,These are not belts. Belts go around something. These are only 11 inches long. They are worthless.
1.0,This shirt is very large not a small.  There is a hole in the back of the shirt so it is unwearable.<br /> Unfortunately I have already washed it.
1.0,"Material too thin, my son only wore it one time."
1.0,"The sweater they sent me had one tie at the side it’s supposed to tie on that was like only 4 or 5 inches long,<br />And the tie on the other side was crazy long so the only way to tie the sweater was to wrap the one tie all the way around your waist like a belt and then tie it to the little tie on the side which is not long enough to make a bow with. So then it’s this baggy loose sweater with a waist tie belt that I couldn’t make a bow with, it looked awful and not the drooping loose side tie sweater as shown in the picture."
1.0,It feels so cheap like it would break with barley anything on it.. stretched so much with my car key on it.. just horrible material and not what I expected at all
1.0,The material is terrible quality. The bathing suit was shoved into a ziplock bag. The wire from the top is practically pushing out already. Spend the extra money and buy something nicer.
1.0,Pants are poor quality.<br />Very cheap fabric
1.0,Item arrived and did not work (light sensor is defective) In addition the item had a price tag on it $4.99 why is it $12.00 on Amazon?
1.0,These were much larger and fake cheap looking than the picture looks.
1.0,Horrible sizing. Cannot possibly fit anyone over a 13 and pull together in the front and have the fabric meet!
1.0,Didn't work for me
1.0,It's like it was a returned item!! It came with a dirty sock missing an item and torn hair clips. The wig wasn't in the net and the wig cap was missing!!! I would give it zero stars but obviously can't
1.0,They were great at the beginning after a month of wearing them 3 days a week at the YMCA  the bottoms started to blow out  not worth  it don't buy them
1.0,i am very disappointed with this shoes. its not even waterproof and shoe-less is not good and its 1 less holder was break within 2 months and we can not return it after a month.
1.0,"came with a warning about harsh chemicals used in processing it that might interfere with fetal development (!!)  If it can hurt the womb, it's too harsh for wear"
1.0,These are junk.  The material is so poor that they will not keep shape when you put them on. Lite weight and flimsy.  Junk. Do not buy
1.0,Dislike. Does not fit
1.0,Mine came with a rip in them and the process to return them was so complex I decided to just take the loss of my money.  I do not recommend.
1.0,"very larger that it kind of look too fake. the side view is layered too high. Very pretty, but not for me."
1.0,Extremely bulky and uncomfortable.<br />Very hard to wash dishes
1.0,"I’ll update if this changes, got my daughter for Christmas and it doesn’t change color just grey."
1.0,they were too strong.
1.0,"Very flimsy hat, definitely NOT worth the money.  Will not purchase from selller again."
1.0,Poor quality by far the worst piece of clothing I’ve ever ordered. Fabric very cheap. Garment very wide and too short
1.0,The material is awful. It’s like basket ball shorts. Reminds me of the “roll of shirts” in Idiocracy. This shirt is garbage.
1.0,se oxido
1.0,Item did not come as pictured. Very disappointed especially for the money spent on a keychain. Do not order if you are wanting exactly what is pictured. My little silver circle is scratched up and says creative details instead of bts on one side and a heart on the other. On the big silver part the heart is faded on one part and it doesn’t look like what is pictured.
1.0,"I was pleased how it looked, only wore 2 times.  As it is not something you would wear daily, it is stored in a felt box.  I wore it with my good pieces to an art opening, looked down & a stone was missing.  I am very upset, as it did not hit anything & no reason for stone falling out. I was going to purchase  another piece, now i cannot.  A jeweler said 120 to fix & replace stone.  Can i send back to be repaired"
1.0,These do not work for me. I have ankle swelling and cardiologist prescribed compression hose. The type she prescribed  cover from toe to above knees. They are quite expensive. Thought the ones I bought would be adequate. They do not prevent the swelling.
1.0,"Super cute, for is perfect. Only down side is when it arrived, it had a hole in the material. Sad to have to return."
1.0,"I'm 5'3 and about 150 lbs. I ordered a medium. The length was good and the circumference (around my middle) all fit well, and its a very cute coat. I loved the design, that's why I took a risk ordering something with no reviews. Unfortunately the shoulders protruded strangely (almost as if there were shoulder pads) and the bicep area was really tight. Hard to move your arms around at all. The sleeves were also a bit short on my arms. Had to return it."
1.0,Very small even for compression socks xl may fit a mens 9 if you stand on your head and lube your feet up with motor oil.
1.0,The completely wrong product was sent not the right color not the right style not a cross body purse no cell phone holder nothing was the same as the description and picture
1.0,I had high hopes based on the reviews but ultimately I returned this suit after trying two different sizes.  I did not like how tight it was across my midsection.  Did nothing to hide my fatness.  No thanks.
1.0,It was too hard to put on my glasses.
1.0,This pair of earrings are so small I dont believe you could even put them on a child. I have small hands and a put one on the tip of my pinky. It was sitting there. It would not go over. Disappointed!
1.0,The dress is not what it seems in the picture. In the picture the dress is long. When i got it and tried it on the dress was a little below my knees. Im a lil disappointed
1.0,Not as advertised didn't receive the colors shown !!!
1.0,Way to small. If you have chicken legs these are perfect for you
1.0,"This picture and description is very deceptive. Description says Large. I made sure to pick large from the sizes. This bag is really small and for the price on it, definately not worth it! I’ll definately return it."
1.0,The item arrived today and the color doesn't even come close to matching the color in the photo.  So disappointed!!!
1.0,It's doesn't have good quality. I have sent it as gift and I am sorry for that.
1.0,Low quality. Headband had a big hole in the seam.
1.0,"Ball fell off when package was opened, before any attempt to wear. Ball will not reinsert, so ring cannot be closed; waste of money."
1.0,Thin and insubstantial. Doesn't absorb more than a half teaspoon of sweat before it gives up.  Poorly seamed on the inside -- stitching came out after first wash. Not worth the price.
1.0,"Beautiful but, to tight and I have skinny wrist and than it's hard to remove"
1.0,"This cap does not fit properly at all, the sides come down so far that it covers part of my ears. Not cute or comfortable."
1.0,"If you have a larger bust then don't bother.  The rest of the dress is okay, but the top/bust portion was wayyy too small."
1.0,"Terrible, poorly made garment. Sent it back immediately. Wal mart has better quality than this piece of crap!"
1.0,Cute fit everywhere except over head- hole is so small I had to wrestle to get it over her head
1.0,"The emblem is so small and shallow you can barely see it.  Very disappointed, have been looking everywhere for a silicone Masonic Ring...."
1.0,"This is the bitsy cut, not classic and this is not noted in the product description."
1.0,"there is no way to see out the darn thing! there are 2 tiny slots. for the price, its a complete rip off. boo!"
1.0,"The chain was broken when I received it. Otherwise it was cute, which made it even more disappointing when I got it."
1.0,I received this dress with the 2 large top buttons missing. I want to keep this dress but I will need to purchase new buttons and have someone sew them on for me. I will only keep the dress if I’m able to get a substantial discount to fix the problem. Please get in touch with me ASAP or I will return the dress. Thank you.
1.0,"these shorts are dry clean only which really sucks and they run large I wear 32 in waist these measure at least 34, so disappointed"
1.0,Zipper broke on second use when the bag was not full. I should have read the other reviews before purchasing. This was very disappointing as I love the color and size of this bag. Will not be purchasing from this brand again.
1.0,They where clip on my fault for not reading
1.0,Does not fit at all. I ordered a size up and it's still too small! I will be returning.
1.0,I bought the white one and it is extremely see through!
1.0,"When top was received, the inner packaging was ripped open. The garment had numerous areas of discoloration, picks in the fabric, tiny holes on front and back (approximately 6 different holes) and was MUCH SMALLER than the XXL was portrayed in their description!! Made me question how their reviews could possibly be authentic!!"
1.0,Came broken. Beside that it feels nice
1.0,"Only received an empty jewelry  bag, the ear rings were missing"
1.0,"Had very high expectations for this shirt, however, it looks like it came from WISH. the neck opening is not wide enough to show both shoulders."
1.0,Beautiful ring liked everything about it until I noticed after wearing it less than 24 hours it had already started turning my finger green.  Really disappointing since it looked so nice when i put it on...
1.0,- Very small and thin<br />- One post was bent... returning
1.0,The only reason this gets 1 star is because the fabric and puff balls are so cute.  The quality and workmanship is extremely poor.  The seams are barely tacked. The edges of the hem are not finished so they will unravel. There is no lining on the neckline so the hem edges flop around outside the dress.  This dress might last through 1 wearing.  Guess that's what you get for a $7 dress.  So disappointed.
1.0,"this thing is terrible!!!<br /><br />it smelled very bad when it arrived, and it still smells inside when you open it.<br /><br />design is flawed, lid does not stay open, you need to hold it open with one hand and juggle-in the watch with the other hand.<br /><br />does not handle watches for people with large wrists, I had to stuff a rag between the holder and the watch to make it stay in.<br /><br />after two weeks, it burned out.  it no longer works with transformer or battery.<br /><br />i  threw it away rather than request a refund, because I simply wanted this thing out of my life!!!!!!!"
1.0,Pictured 3 but you only get 1
1.0,Got caught in my hoody and broke right in half. Have worn this for less than 2 months. LIVID. Messaged the manufacturer. Hoping they take it back.
1.0,Fell apart day one
1.0,The chain has an obvious mend in it. I bought this for graduation.  To late to replace..<br />.junk
1.0,"I wanted to like this so much. But, other than the price, I disliked everything about it. The fabric of both the sweater and the sleeves feels cheap and thin. And the sizing seems odd; I was afraid that if I bought the medium, the length would be too short (and I was right), so I bought a large. But the neck and the sleeves were just way too loose and baggy in that size. It's going back right away."
1.0,Very bad material. Dont buy it
1.0,"Although these look nice before putting them on, they do not fit well and stick out to the side, making the wearer look somewhat demented."
1.0,This item just doesn’t work. After it is in the purse the pockets are all hidden by the sides of the bags. So after you locate the pockets and put things in them the center area is squeezed into a small space and things like your wallet and checkbook do not fit. Plus it sags over making it worse. I guess I should have known “it was too good to be true”. Save your money.
1.0,"If you love to waste time and money then this is the item for you! Like to be taken, ripped off and just plain out lied to? Then purchase zoomies, if you don't have money to burn and time to waste, then just pass zoomies on by. These are the worthless pieces of junk I have ever seen. They don't do as the advertisement on t.v. shows, they don't zoom to be clear and see items off in the distant clear. As a matter of fact they don't even fit an adult. I bought them with the great 400x magnifaction upgrade at a total of $35.90, after I called to fix the confusion presented on the zoomie website where you double your order due to no explaination on how many you want to order. (Would've been charged $71.80 if I hadn't checked the status). DO NOT PURCHASE ZOOMIES"
1.0,dress was too tight material was cheap
1.0,Algo bueno
1.0,Great cut/design on the dress but material is cheap and already shredding within the material itself and ripping at seams right out of the bag.
1.0,Ordered a medium for a &#34;looser&#34; fit--still clingly and the fabric was very thin:  not at all what I expected and returned for a refund.
1.0,This didn't fit in my ear like it I expected. One of the balls also disintegrated on the inside which caused it to fall off. Now the rest of it is stuck in my ear and I cannot pull it out because the end is too big to fit through the ear hole.
1.0,"1) the world time on the bezel was very hard to read.<br />2) when I went for a walk in the cold weather, condensation appeared beneath the crystal. It dissipated in about 1/2 hour.<br />However when i went out in the cold weather the next day, the condensation appeared beneath the crystal again."
1.0,This was a waste of money. A big disappointment.
1.0,It came like this.  It was suppose to come neatly in a the bag with a card and saying about friendship and it didn’t!!!! This was a gift for my daughters best friend going away to college and it looks like trash and NO saying!  Completely disappointed !!
1.0,"Twin grandchildren love these, but they torn easy. Which made for a lot of tears. Very unhappy."
1.0,This is just a piece of lace in a tube.  No support and very loose.  I wouldn't recommend for anyone with a cup larger than a B.
1.0,Seams reaped before 1st wash
1.0,"I did not receive anything!! As in, I received an empty product bag with no glasses! Because of the current social distancing situation I can't go anywhere to send back the empty bag and I can't print a return label, so I am out of luck. Extremely unhappy!!!"
1.0,"Rhey run very small in size. But im reordering one whole size larger, instead of size 2 i'll go 3."
1.0,Very disappointing<br /><br />I bought a few different colors and they all feel different. They stretched after wearing them a few times and now they’re too big around the band. The fabric was uncomfortable and unfortunately I tried one on once and then washed them so I can’t return them.
1.0,Didn’t fit anything like the way it was shown.  I would never wear this in public. It got like a nightgown or old woman’s house coat!
1.0,I was unable to get the new bands to attach. The old ones snapped in and screwed easily. These did not snap in place and couldn’t be coerced to stay in place. The screw holes also didn’t line up with the watch face.
1.0,Stiff and item ran small.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6ccfdf9f9cca6a20a148e2254c6687f0]] These masks are a waste of money very thin and poor quality
1.0,Another enormous disappointment - ordered in larger size to ensure baggy effect and it looks like a shirt for a small child. Don't see any ability to return. These experiences are making me reactant to order on line. Losing money and the convenience factor.
1.0,This heavy winter coat is a joke. Not heavy made poorly no down in it not a tag on it. Nothing was sent with it so I have no idea where to send it back. Also I normally wear a large I ordered a Xlg and can not get my arms in the coat.This coat would not keep anybody warm.
1.0,Need to change out for 3 x
1.0,Very cute dress but sizes run very very small
1.0,The dress was way way way too small (ordered 9-12 months) for my  8 month old baby. I compared it to her 3-6m clothes and it was the same size. Very cute though and soft material! Just too small.
1.0,Don't buy poorly made
1.0,They weren't quality made
1.0,Expect you fingers to burst the seams at the hands
1.0,They were nit Large. Medium at best so order a size large than you would normally. Also they will shrink. A lot. I returned them.
1.0,If you are plus size this dress runs extremely small. I ordered 3x which isnt my size im 2x and it was a no go. I will say its beautiful and the coloris nice.
1.0,The color on both masks I received stained my pillowcase even after machine washing.  Finally threw them away.
1.0,Don’t fit
1.0,Its awful. It looks like someone took a green pillowcase and cut holes in it. It looks NOTHING like the picture. Not even worth returning its that bad.
1.0,plastic crap available for $0.99 eleswhere
1.0,"I purchased this product months ago, but never decided to open it. I noticed it felt lite, but it is a small bottle so I didn't worry. When I finally took it out of its original packaging and opened it, it was completely empty!!! Complete rip off. There is no way it should have evaporated. Do not waste your money!!!!!!!"
1.0,The item fits well but has a few issues. The helmet is crooked and its scratched on the left side. It might not be new as advertised.
1.0,"Lens popped out numerous times in the first week of wearing them. Frames are not bamboo, just a vinyl wrapping that looks like bamboo but is really just colorful plastic.  Come on Panama Jack; you are better than this."
1.0,Way too short. It came right under my butt so i have ti wear it with leggings.
1.0,It's meant for someone with small ears. I think they try and create something for all ear typed.
1.0,"First time, both were too small. They are NOT a size large. Replacement, fit a little better. But then one pair, the lining came out completely after three uses. Amazon refunded me. I suggest to not buy these at all."
1.0,"Save your money and buy other Halloween decorations. I used a command hook to hang on my front door, within 1 day it completely fell apart. The arms wouldn't stay up and the hook to hang the witch ripped as well. Extremely disappointed since I over paid for this garbage."
1.0,It cut very small.
1.0,"I did not order these. I ordered blue, saphire and not this style. Ok so deal with it, but when I went to put them on, the post bent. Fixed it and tried again but it snapped off. Very cheap."
1.0,It didn’t look like the picture. It made me look frumpy.
1.0,Took a very long time to come an quality very bad.  Falls apart easy
1.0,Crown broke as soon as we tried to fasten it! Brittle and cheap!
1.0,this belt is a piece of crap and the knob that holds it on broke after 5 uses.
1.0,Straps too short. Not adjustable.  Rides up over boobs. Useless.
1.0,Feels like paper. No warmth to it at all.
1.0,"The. Mask are smaller than shown on pic and was not able to return, would not recommend to buy"
1.0,The socks we received are no where near the quality of what we ordered. They are more similar to a pair of stockings than compression socks. Very disappointed.
1.0,Way small and used the size chart.  Crappy material
1.0,The screw back easy removed and get lost. Too bad cant wear it anymore
1.0,"Didn’t even bother trying on so can’t rate the fit; fabric was a very stiff weird fabric, not a loose clingy material as pictured"
1.0,They fall apart .Their were little beads going everywhere before I could really get them out package. Dont buy these you will be disappointed. Well the ones made w beads anyway
1.0,No quedó bien y no tiene forma en frente. No quedó bien a pesar de que fue a un maniquí que se lo puse
1.0,The stone looks strangely unfaceted ...something is odd about it. Bummer.
1.0,Cheap design too big .
1.0,its a fake
1.0,These were a waste of $. Suiser to be a nice color & were horrible. Dob’t Mother
1.0,I usually wear a large. Purchased a large and xlarge. Both fit like a medium.
1.0,The blouse was not true to size. Gave it away very tight in the arms.
1.0,Cute but broke pretty quick and now I can’t use it if this would have broke while I was out and about I would have lost all my ids and cards and cash
1.0,too big and bulky.  Thought the &#34;stones&#34; would be smaller.
1.0,"The belts were not a woman's XL. The one star relates to the sizing of the belt. I was very pleased with the delivery and how quickly the merchandise arrived, just unhappy with the fact that it didn't fit. It seemed to be an Xl for a child and not an adult woman. Thank you."
1.0,not as pictured with a hole
1.0,"they ware out really quickly, I have only had them for 6 months and they all ready have holes in them and tares everywhere. I not too supersized because they were really cheep"
1.0,It said they ran small. I ordered large and it's too big for me.
1.0,"I ordered my normal size, Large on this shirt. It was way too tight in the bust area. I was also not pleased with material, I didn’t read the description well enough to know it was “rayon” & no flexibility at all. I like something with cotton & spandex so it’s stretchy & comfy."
1.0,The necklace hook came broken while still in the package. I do not recommend this item
1.0,I didn’t even want to give this a one star. The sleeves were so small I couldn’t get my arms through while the body portion was so big I could fit two of me. Feels like it was one of those knock off horrible disasters you see in the funny posts on Facebook. Returned the dress the next day!!!!
1.0,Fit was right but they were very thin and just shredded after one use in the pool.
1.0,"No, just no. This is a glorified burlap sack."
1.0,"Very dissapointed. Although it's good material, did not like the style, too long and say too big. Do not recommend buying this style of skirt. Will stick with peril skirts from now on."
1.0,Color of elephant are very light. Does not look like the picture. Dissapointed!
1.0,"What are these on January 5 and they arrived on February 9. I ordered size 3X. I am a plus size women that wears A size 24 in Avenue jeans or Seven7 jeans. These leggings were thin, see-through and clearly not plus sized at  3X. My husband put these on for me to model them. He is 5‘10“ tall, 185 pounds. These were tight on him. I couldn’t get these over my calves much less up my body. The waist measures 15 inches across, so a 30 inch waist. There isn’t much stretch in the waistband. I also ordered the royal blue color and got this dull blue gray color. I would not recommend these at all."
1.0,The pins that hold the bands in place fall right out. I already lost 2 of them just by taking the bands out of the package and they just arrived today.
1.0,One screw is gone ... amazon did not help me to replace it. Therefore the Key Ring is not operational. The screws are very problematic .
1.0,"I own several Luminox watches.  They are very good quality & very durable.  I bought 2 new Luminox watches from this seller for my twin sons birthday gift in September 2019.  One of the watches broke in less than 3 months.  The second hand fell off inside the watch.  I contacted Amazon & the seller for repairs & was told SORRY, YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP YOUR WARRANTY WITH LUMINOX.  I contacted Luminox & was told I did not buy from an authorized seller & had to pay $118.00 to repair a BRAND NEW LUMINOX WATCH.  ***DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER, BUY FROM LUMINOX DIRECTLY***"
1.0,Not worth the money .. these earrings are heavy and discolored after a few weeks of wearing
1.0,"The ring looks like a blob, cannot see the detail like in the pictures. Very disappointed in the quality of the design"
1.0,Horrible material and way too much fabric. It feels like a ton!
1.0,What a joke
1.0,too small and doesn't stay on
1.0,Not Xlarge at all.
1.0,Bought this as a stocking stuffer gift for my girlfriend and it was way too big. I even tried it on myself and it was huge on me. Both of us have average to small wrists but it slid half way up our arms. It is not one size fits all.
1.0,"I ordered this jacket, but had to return it. The sizing on this item just ran too small. I ordered an XL, so I could wear a sweater under it,  but it was sized as a cross between a small and medium. It wouldn't even close together in the front, much less even trying to get it buttoned! I normally wear a medium to large tops."
1.0,"These look nice, but they are very cheaply made. They broke within a week."
1.0,Tried it on 4 cars and didn't work on any. Would have returned it  but was to late.
1.0,"turned black in like a week, i dont know why that happen but it is not dirty black, it is a different black all over the watch"
1.0,Fabric is like for a Halloween custom
1.0,the adjuster is plastic. I washed it prior ro use and when it came out of the dryer the plastic was broken. therefore you cannot use the strap.
1.0,Stockings were too tight and took great effort to get on without help. After wearing for several hours I had pain in my legs and again had to struggle to get the off by myself. I would not recommend these to anyone who has a moderately larger calf and or has to put them on and remove them by themselves. As a nurse there is no way I could have worn them to work in.
1.0,Caution! This sweater is ridiculously too small. I could tell right out of packaging. It looks like it should fit a toddler. Obviously returning today. Buyer beware. Also came balled up in package. Not even folded.
1.0,These are very big
1.0,It broke the 1st time I wore it.
1.0,Not flattering at all and returns arent possible
1.0,The pieces came covered in glue! Some have glue spots others are dull totally covered with  a thin glue layer.  Cannot use them for jewelry making business.
1.0,No es cafe es color mostaza
1.0,The shirts ride up. Even when only walking around the house.<br />Thinking of returning the set of three.<br />Can I return something that has been worn??
1.0,"Size 42 for room - They fit like they were 38 - The rear kept sliding down as though it was by design to sag in the back.<br />The worst part - Washed first, Worn once, washed a second time and the rear pocket was torn about 2"" from the corner of the back pocket.<br />I want my money back or an exchange to see if this was by design or just a bad pair of shorts.<br />Until then I will remain a 1star so others know this issue was not resolved and to be aware even further of the supplier as well.<br />I hope this helps others."
1.0,so cheap and junkie less than bubble gum machine quality
1.0,Tarnished with one wear. I dumped them
1.0,"It broke with the first use, a moderate rain, nothing much! Awful quality."
1.0,did not meet expectations. see through material. not a good quality
1.0,The picture made it look like a good quality jacket. It was made of a very thin material. The price was way too high for flimsy material.
1.0,"The band/buckle broke the first time my son wore this. I put it back together, and it broke again on 2nd wearing. So, it's basically useless, and I have to go to the effort of packaging and waiting for the UPS person just to send this back."
1.0,This dress to me is more like night gown quality.  I will wear it for that but not out in public.
1.0,These slippers were only one month used and the sole came off. I'm glad I noticed before my daughter went up or down the stairs. She is old enough to put them on herself but not old enough to know these are not good to wear. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!
1.0,Color nice<br />Too heavy<br />To warm<br />Heal to high thick soles
1.0,This item was delivered with a hole in the pocket. SO disappointed.
1.0,The zipper got off track and broke when I tried to put it back on!
1.0,"Item fits awful, smells awful, and is not off the shoulder it creeps back up."
1.0,Complete garbage do not buy them. These are not compression socks at all
1.0,"I wanted to love this bralette so much but I had to return it. I wanted to leave a review regardless for women looking to buy this product:<br /><br />A. If you don’t have big ole boobies, this is not for you. I shed over 100lbs and as a result have tinier boobs now that need more support (I also have 2 babies) and I was hoping this bralette would be the perfect addition to my collection— it did not fit properly as soon as I put it on<br /><br />B. It’s like a piece of cloth. No under wire, no support (which is advertised as well) so I put a normal bra on under it hoping it would maybe look better worn over an actual bra? NOPE! The thing was drooping off of my chest entirely. I knew then even the smallest size wouldn’t fit me. For reference I’m 4'10 & between 102-104lbs.<br /><br />C. No padding. Straight nips through it without wearing a bra or nipple covers underneath<br /><br />Hope this helps! Xx"
1.0,"These boxer briefs are on a determined mission to crawl deep up my butt crack. After moving two steps they're already trying to separate the step-children. I am far too cramped to enjoy my day and am spending every ten minutes trying to rearrange myself. One star for making my ass look great, though."
1.0,"Used 1 time, then unit fails to turn on at times. When it does turn on, all presets are gone as if battery was removed. Also poor sound quality, very tinny as if no bass at all. Will be returning this product ASAP."
1.0,xxl does not fit  all other shirts x large fits
1.0,The shirt is too big and the holes in it are horrible it looks like a mouse ate it it's terrible I will never order from you again
1.0,I would not order this again.
1.0,"I love it some much, it's turning this copper color because the paint stuff has faided, after 1 week"
1.0,"The dress was too small, tight and short."
1.0,"I got these so my wife can hang things from her cell phone. They work for a short time, but every thing she, I or others have used them for has fallen apart after a few weeks or a few months. Do Not Use for anything of value as sooner or later you will loose it."
1.0,Ripped first time i wore them
1.0,"After washed in cold water, it shrunk and cannot be wore."
1.0,These gloves stitching came apart the first time I put them on
1.0,Very thin material not kid size
1.0,Ordered size large fits like a small!
1.0,"I really wanted to love this.  It's very cute! And has a liner for your chest (not the back). The problem is the shirt is cut short through the torso (not terrible if you don't mind that) and the arms are cut so shirt as to be a 3/4 length sleeve, again this could be okay except that they have a tight elastic that runs where it should be on your wrist.  If the sleeve was long enough it would be fine but as it is, it is too tight on my arm (where the 3/4 sleeve falls).  If you are shorter perhaps this would work.  I'm only 5'6 and typically proportioned in length this is odd. In terms of sizing it fit comfortably but for me the sleeve elastic made it  unwearable."
1.0,Not quality I expected.
1.0,sorry to tell you that it wasnot working and i tried to fix it but it was completely ruined
1.0,I was expecting this to be a thicker flannel material. It fix fine but when the sleeves were buttoned they were tight. It came really wrinkled with strings hanging out of all the seams. Not worth the price you pay for it. It's more like sleepwear than a dress.
1.0,Clearly not real silver- has putting and is really chrome like in finish. Ring is not as pictured- it has been made in a mold. Disappointed- but not surprised. You get what you pay for -it is not the bargain fund you are hoping for.
1.0,"The delivery was fast. But the product doesn't look the same as in the picture! I am a busty woman (40F), and i order this one because of the good reviews from other women like me. This one didn't fit well at all! I had to return it..."
1.0,Horrible size chart. I will order but it will be a true “guess”.
1.0,So cute but the fit is terrible! The cups barely cover your chest. Torso is so short it seems made wrong.
1.0,The colors don’t really match.
1.0,Clasp on the strap broke within the first day!
1.0,No I hate it.  The design was so incorrect that anyway you wear it it shows too much breasts and barely covers it.  I seriously hate it.  The color and fabric was okay but that's all.  I'm actually going to make a skirt out of it.
1.0,NOT Citizen and not metal - plastic.  Does not say anywhere on the watch or the packaging that this is a Citizen watch.  What it does say is that the watch case is plastic.  No English instructions.
1.0,Big hole and little pink holes thru out at all points of stitching
1.0,the sequins centerpiece was missing some of the sequins and the clip on the bow is broken!!I didn't like that.... very disappointed!!!
1.0,Poor cut and fit.
1.0,"She didn't like it. Very thin, threads unravelling hole in the side."
1.0,TO SHORT & NOT TRUE TO SIZE!!!!!
1.0,I've worn these pants maybe 4 times and there's already a hole ripping near the back seam. For a hundred and twenty bucks I'd expect better quality from Barefoot Dreams.
1.0,"I bought two orders of dark brown, one of the items is marked dark brown but it is black.  Package inappropriately labeled and wrong color"
1.0,The material is off it definitely not like the picture. I would not advise to purchase
1.0,"The sizing on this is way... OFF!!! im  5'5 130bls 36 b ,,, and XL fits like a XS!! If the size was right would love it, =/"
1.0,"Thought these looked really cute and after seen a similar style in a store I was really hoping to find them online for a better price. Ordered these, but once they arrived realized they were not what we expected at all. The headband itself seems flimsy and afraid it is going to break right away. The white earmuff part was the most disappointing, however. They are only fuzzy on the outside, the inside is a smooth fleece so when you put it on, it looks like you're missing huge chunks of fluff. They don't cover the ear well and fall off easily. Very disappointed. Ended up going back to the store and buying the better ones for a little more."
1.0,NOT impressed. Very dainty and cheap looking. Also beyond smaller than I expected
1.0,You can clearly see the discoloration in the vinyl they used to apply the image<br /><br />Probably the worst thing I have ever ordered from amazon
1.0,Thin Poor quality fabric and small sizing.  The medium is more like a small.  Will return item
1.0,I wore them for the first time last night. When I took them off I noticed a stone gone. They were very pretty so I’m disappointed.
1.0,"I have washed these several times (with vinegar), and the dye still rubs off on my feet and makes them black when I try to wear them. Given that, I don't dare wash them with other clothing.  I have not had this problem with other bamboo socks, so I've just given up on these."
1.0,"The look was very nice. However, once I placed my iphone in the wallet I was unable to use the touch screen through the clear plastic cover on my iphone 6s which was one of the main reasons i chose this item. Sent it back."
1.0,pero n o era la tela que esperaba
1.0,"The fabric is chintzy, meaning it looks and feel cheap.  It fits more like a ""house-dress"" than a flattering summer frock."
1.0,Pretty and easy to drive car wearing these gloves.
1.0,piece of crap
1.0,"This mask was VERY DISAPPOINTING, IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES SHOWN ON AMAZON. I would advise people not to buy this mask.."
1.0,"Wore this ring one day and the shine wore right off, shows scratches and dents, not worth the money"
1.0,"After reading reviews mentioning that the tunic runs small I was planning to order medium or even large but then decided to go with small to have something shaping. But the tunic that came is huge! I would say the size L or XL in regular clothes while I usually wear small (4-6). In addition to this, the color does not look like dark blue on the images but rather something light and uneven. Very disappointed with the purchase!"
1.0,Broke after 3rd day with it
1.0,Cheaply made -  returned.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. They sat unevenly on my face, frames were off."
1.0,Already returned it
1.0,"This was for a semi-formal dance.  The color was to be burgendy , but looked more “tomato”.  The sequins were bright but did not look nice on the dress."
1.0,"Horrible quality, poorly done, can barely read the writing and looks like it came from a quarter machine."
1.0,"I loved the look of these, but they broke after 3-4 wears. They didn't stay in place very well either."
1.0,"Probably the worst dress I’ve ever bought online, and I buy a few each month. First off the neckline is cut too high and is annoying and choking. The material is too dense and thick for even a semi-tropical climate, and the fabric design amplifies every worst curve on your body."
1.0,I do not like being deceived when buying a product not only is this not the same shirt in the picture the color is a cream online and in person is yellow
1.0,I Ordered the ivory due to already purchasing one in black on eBay. But unfortunately this one did t come with the 3hook choice but instead all one hook which make only one size instead of having the choice to make tight or lose. You stick with one size only
1.0,I wore this ring one time and the stone fell out. Very disappointed . Otherwise it is a beautiful ring.
1.0,Way too small. If you waistline is less than 30 in. do not buy. Even the largest size will not fit.
1.0,"It is like a child's toy, I was expecting something a bit nicer."
1.0,These are not water proof as advertised. My kiddos used them when we went to the snow. Complete waste of money
1.0,"Jacket is not fleeces nor hooded and more of a spring not winter weight, also not dark brown a much lighter brown. Also ships from China and can't be returned free. The other views are probably scam reviews they ship packages to people who did not order them then write review (see CBS this morning report)"
1.0,Why do it say purple when it's pink
1.0,"I usually wear large pants, bought a large and it was big. It tends to get bigger in size after wearing and washing. The texture is not thick at all and gets misshaped after a couple of hours."
1.0,Does not fit pretty disappointed I got what size the recommended and didn't fit. Barely fits past my legs then I can't zip. Fabric is hanging from the pockets. I now can't get a return so wasted my money DON'T BUYY.
1.0,Not cute at all
1.0,"These are more like a “shape wear” garment them they are shorts. They have some weird raised fabric that I assume is supposed to, “Lift your butt” but because you can clearly see the fabric it’s not flattering. Very restricting around the elastic on the hem of the thighs. Like I said, Shapewear not yoga shorts. -🌟"
1.0,This belt is good for about a month.  Buckle came completely apart.
1.0,"Didn’t like that gloves were not lined, was surprised dish clothes were included. Hate not having cotton lined gloves, with these unlined clothes you feel all the heat from using hot water. Will not recommend these gloves."
1.0,These earrings are pretty but came with prices of rubber as the backing? Seems like children’s jewelry and does not work due to the low quality backings.
1.0,Doesn't look. Nothing like the pic. Its ugly
1.0,Beautiful dress but the night of my sister in laws wedding rehearsal while zipping the dress on the zipper completely fell apart. Couldn't wear the dress at all. Was so upset it was a travel wedding so I didn't bring any other dresses to wear. The company was very good with the return though.
1.0,"I purchase these Vionics for our recent long-awaited 2-wk Italy vacation. I selected this gladiator pair based on reviews, manufacturer claims and wearing the sandals around the house, comparing them to a few other pairs I had ordered. I knew that there would be a lot of walking on the trip and knew that I would need quality, supportive footwear. I have struggled in the past with pain caused by neuromas in my feet that can flare up from time to time when I wear non-supportive footwear, so I am very careful. The Vionics were the most expensive pair at $109 but I am willing to pay what I consider a lot of money for the right shoes. Six days into the trip, I was bragging to my boyfriend about how comfortable the sandals were and how happy I was with the support. But halfway through the trip, the left shoe failed me and I started experiencing pain and discomfort. In addition to the pain, it drizzled one day and my feet got a little wet and the color from the dark leather straps of the sandals stained my feet in several places. I could live with the stain issue but I can’t live with the discomfort. I feel like I paid a lot of money for shoes that failed, and I don’t feel like I will ever be able to wear them again so I definitely don’t feel like I got what I paid for. Other than the couple of days I spent trying these shoes out after I received them, I essentially wore them for only 2 weeks.<br />Vionic claims that they believe so strongly in their product that you can wear them for 30 days and return them if you’re not satisfied. I was so impressed with this that I took the chance on their brand. Unfortunately I am not not happy after only wearing them for 2 weeks. Although I was beyond the 30-day return window for Amazon, I shared my experience with the seller and asked if there was anything that could be done under the circumstances. They opened a case with the manufacturer but they declined to make an exception or do anything. Very disappointing. I will not purchase Vionics again and I cannot recommend their product."
1.0,Would be great if there was a way to SELECT FOR SIZE ON THIS SITE
1.0,"I was sent a pullover, not a cardigan. Sent it back. Too bad as I liked the fabric."
1.0,"Absolutely terrible. The picture of the face is way, way too big and mine came sewn upside down. Totally useless! Save your money!"
1.0,Dont want to give a star. A small child could fit this . Not an adult
1.0,Don't fit well
1.0,The glass is smaller than I excepted. I don’t like it. I don’t recommend for others to buy.
1.0,"Don't buy, not worth the poor craftsmanship. Fit is loose, buttons on the sleeve fell right off the second I tried it on. Returned!"
1.0,broke the first day i wore it. the tree came off and was lost.
1.0,"waste of time and money, its just a sock at ten times the price, if you need compression buy real compression socks"
1.0,Band is quite stiff & not getting better. Looks great but I'm not pleased with the leather. Leather?
1.0,"The hem pulled off after one wear, and the slip is now unwearable. Pretty crap product."
1.0,The  cut was not it .. it was way too long up and the dress material was not good at all.
1.0,This was real not good. It looked like the dress from big mamas house.
1.0,"First of all these boots were delivered just loose in a bag and the quality is very poor! You can see the glue around the sole and feels all lumpy on the inside under your foot.  It's too bad because from a distance, they are really cute."
1.0,this is a horrible looking mask I have a large male head and it's too large for me it has wrinkles in it and it doesn't look realistic anywhere near realistic it's just a horrible horrible mask
1.0,Cheap material does not fit well.
1.0,Made in China!!  Material very thin; spend the little bit of extra money for a more durable pair of gloves.
1.0,The dress is very bad quality. It's like a bathing suit material and does not make your body look pretty at all. The medium is large.  I was very disappointed I could get the same dress in WISH.
1.0,The entire back does not heat… only heats at the neck area. Not as expected
1.0,Cheap made need i say more
1.0,I dont recommend
1.0,Both bottoms came off shoes as soon as my daughter put them on. Returning them now 😩 I had them delivered because we don't get out much but now I have to make a trip to UPS store to mail them back after finding somewhere to print shipping label ...
1.0,"Loved the quality of the knit material!<br />Did not,however, like the mechanics.<br />I had to return the hat as the led light did not work. Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,The item description plainly says &#34;2 pack&#34; but I only received one hat
1.0,The clip for the stockings immediately broke!
1.0,They were beautiful but to small!
1.0,Would not recommend picture is very very low quality I am sure someone with a cricut can make this product way better
1.0,No stars. Product looked NOTHING like the picture. There were the 2 engraved hearts and the ZTA letters but a cheap looking chain and no special bangles or detail beads as advertised in the picture for the bracelet. Complete false advertising and very overpriced for the crappy bracelet I received. Buyers beware!
1.0,"DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!! Worse amazon purchase I’ve ever made. NOT high waisted at all, the material is absolutely her Renda’s. It is not like sweat pant material. It’s some god awful unbelievable polyester cotton blend of fabric created by Satan.  I have a small waist and thick thighs so I ordered the extra large they barely fit at all!  I wanted a nice pair of comfy baggy sweatpants and that is not what I got at all whatsoever. The extra large was literally like a size 6 in woman’s pants."
1.0,Way too thin material- had to send back
1.0,They did nothing and I have a shape to work with 🤷🏻‍♀️
1.0,"After only a few weeks, several small holes formed along one of the seams. They were very thin too. I bought another brand twice and they are thicker and are more durable."
1.0,Don't like decals iron on
1.0,This was too expensive for the cheap quality.  I feel the attachment to the chain will break in two minutes. I definitely don’t recommend this product. Do not buy!
1.0,Breaks really easy
1.0,All that showed up was a Hat no face or neck cover
1.0,I ordered this item in the navy blue with a brown lining but I received the black hat with the gray lining.  The verbiage on the hat's leather tag reads as follows: SONG TING THE POIENER OF FHSAIHNO RENDTS.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item.
1.0,Not cotton and runs small
1.0,It's cute but not sturdy at ALL. It broke within an hour of putting it on.
1.0,Do not buy these. I bought 3. They aren’t worth more than $5. Very poor quality. Not true to size. Flimsy poor  construction. Fabric is not thick enough to even consider as long John or pajama. Fabric pattern is inconsistent. Worst Amazon purchase in my buying history.
1.0,Not that great of a product
1.0,"I order this SAME style, size and brand of bra all the time.<br />I put this one on and it was WAY TIGHT. I thought maybe i got the wrong size. Nope.<br /><br />I laid out the new one from THIS seller against mine that i already have and it is an INCH shorter from the center on BOTH sides, So TWO (2) inches shorter all the way around.<br />It is made and lines with DIFFERENT, ITCHY material (The only reason i buy calvin klein is they USUALLY are so soft you can't feel it)<br />The sizes claim to be the same on both tags (my original and this new one) but they short you on the cut of material. The only thing i can see is that the GOOD one was made in Vietnam, these crappy ones were from Indonesia  they got it all wrong at the factory, VERY disappointed. Guess I wont get my stuff online anymore because even those this is on paper the exact thing i buy every time , they still manage to screw it up<br /><br />Attached pic: The difference in length (that is for EACH side).  so its way tight on me.<br />Pic #2:  Original tag & this one I bought here to verify its the same. supposedly.<br />Pic #3 : Difference of material, comfortable on left, itchy on the right."
1.0,"Not good, the lenses never went back to clear.<br />The lenses stayed tinted after coming back inside.<br />Even after days on my desk in the house they are still tinted<br />I would not recommend"
1.0,Had to return because the top button was physically impossible to button due to the button hole being too small and the button placed too close to the material. The rest of the buttons were extremely difficult. Too bad because it was a cute skirt for the price.
1.0,Cute but not even close to a true xl. My daughter is big chested and I don't think she is going to be able to wear it.  Guess we will find out on Christmas
1.0,These are hard to put on and look cheap.
1.0,This material is for a costume not clothes.
1.0,"This thing sucks, it’s so uncomfortable itchy throat thing is so thin I thought that it would be thick"
1.0,"This shirt was a completely different color than the picture. It also looks like a loose fit style, but it's not. I ordered my usual size, and it was very tight. It's not prime, so now I have to pay return shipping, and who knows how long it'll take to get a seller refund."
1.0,Was way to big. Fits larger than expected. Had to return for refund.
1.0,Wore 5 times and all the thread on one side fell out
1.0,It did not stick. It was a good idea but apparently there was not enough magnetic stuff to work with the lashes
1.0,Dont buy!! If you want the photo to actually show so others can read you will be wasting your money as it does not display like whats in the photo.
1.0,The shirt did not fit and I even ordered a size larger than I usually wear. Very disappointed!
1.0,This was nothing like pictured and had a stain on the bottom
1.0,The cut don’t fit like the the picture.
1.0,"I just received my shirt in the mail and I ordered a large, but it fits like an extra small.  It is way too tight to wear!"
1.0,"Received my order today open the package and this is how one of the masks were, Not very happy with the quality"
1.0,"To thin and small.<br />My cell phone and a small credit card case fit in it, but that's all. When I added an ink pen and lip gloss it started to buldge. Too much purse for such little room.<br />I do like small purses . But at least they are small. This is a bigger bag that holds very little.<br />Dissatisfied and will return"
1.0,Don't order
1.0,The balls at the end broke after 3 days of use
1.0,The ad is misleading it says they’re glass lenses and they’re not they’re plastic and they’re cheap like the ones you can buy at the flea market
1.0,"Shame on this seller.  Clearly led to believe I would receive 3 pair of socks, not one. I'm sending them back based on principle and will buy another brand."
1.0,This was cheap and it showed. I had ordered one years ago and it was awesome! I tried to replace it after having wore it for years and losing it. This one was barely moveable so I couldn’t put it on my ear. When I finally could open it it had sharp corners and wouldn’t close. I wouldn’t recommend this.
1.0,Do. Not. Buy.
1.0,Ordered largest size and it barely fit my 5 year old
1.0,Super cheap material and zero quality
1.0,I love Amazon nothing against
1.0,"I wear an XL shirt size, I mistakenly ordered a 2X. I was hopeful it would just be a little too big and would possibly shrink a bit after a few washes.<br />Oh how I was wrong!! It fits way too snug, not a comfortable fit. Very disappointed.  I could blame myself for the wrong size, if it were too big, but no, it's too small and I ordered a size bigger than what I wear!<br />Also the logo on the shirt feels like it is just a cheap iron on. I think it'll fall off after a few washes.<br />Very disappointing,  the only good was that the order arrived much sooner than expected.<br />Overall,  complete disappointment in this product.  I won't be buying again from this seller."
1.0,The fit on this dress is so horrible that I threw it away.  I'm about 5'4 and wear a junior's medium or 7/8.  This dress hung on me like an old sack...wouldn't even wear it just to lounge in my house.  HORRIBLE.
1.0,"Here is the reality of where these come from.  Rabbits are often stacked in rows on top of one another, which causes animals on the bottom rows to continuously get sprayed with urine and feces. As highly social and curious animals by nature, the constant confinement is mentally debilitating.  In other words...its torture.  DO NOT BUY!  SHAME ON YOU AMAZON."
1.0,Not much compression to these like I was expecting.
1.0,"I love how this necklace and bracelet look, but unfortunately the bracelet rubnerband broke in less than 2 weeks! Very disappointing."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this dress... But it is horrible. The elastic around the waist is very uncomfortable and unflattering. It makes me look like a cow. (And I'm pretty average in size.) 5'4... 140lb. I Purchased a large. I am confused as to why there are BIG loops on each side for a belt, but no belt included... It does show one in the picture! Maybe if it came with the belt, it would have looked better?! I don't know, but I am sorry that I wasted my money and it makes me doubt online ordering in the future."
1.0,"I’d give it zero stars if possible. Item was advertised in English, but arrived in Chinese. False advertising!"
1.0,"This is a cute wallet and a nice small size.  However, the leather ripped where there is stress every time it is unsnapped to open it.  This happened within 6 months of purchase.  I keep using the wallet, but it is ripped. Not a good deal."
1.0,Not what I ordered. Totally wrong. It has tie sleeves instead  of around the neck. Small.
1.0,I’m not sure why they were designed this way but they are tiny. You will lose them.
1.0,Nice looking but the bar slips thru the circle in a couple minutes after wearing & falls off. Had another person put it on & it did the same thing with her. Disappointing to say the least!
1.0,Poor quality. As cheap as the 5 for $1 at the dollar store.
1.0,"These are not full length as stated on the item description! Also, the fabric is weird in that it only stretches width-wise, not length-wise, so there is not chance of stretching them. The fabric was thin, and seems like it could stretch out easily. Buyer beware!"
1.0,Didn’t notice any change on the way I see colors.
1.0,Wrong one. And of coarse a pain in the butt to return.
1.0,I was looking forward to this hoodie and as soon as I opened the bag I saw this white paint spot on the hoodie. As you can see on the photo I tried washing it off and it didn't. I will most definitely be sending this back and never buy from this brand again. Absolute trash quality control. Spend your money elsewhere.
1.0,Broke right after I walked down the isle.
1.0,The clasp was very cheap for what this cost. The loop on the back of the tie was not sewn on properly. The material seemed good though. If they are more careful with putting them together and use a better clasp it could be a good product.
1.0,no bendable nose piece. Won't stay o
1.0,This product is NOT stainless steel. It turned my ear green and caused an infection and allergic reaction. No one should purchase this piece of jewelry. This had to be removed from my ear by a professional piercer with PLIERS!
1.0,Strap not long enough for cross body bag
1.0,Piece of crap
1.0,"Very poor quality, will donate to the Goodwill!"
1.0,A month to receive it after ordering and could not cancel. Had to be done with in 30 minutes after purchase
1.0,broke within minutes of receiving it
1.0,Once washed peals badly amd fades not worth the money.
1.0,Cheaply made. A bead had already broken off by the time it got to me.
1.0,Thank goodness it didn't cost much.....it was tiny and thin and had sharp edges....the stone was cloudy and sphered!
1.0,Cute but runs very small!  Purchased an XL - would not even fit a friend that wears a size 6.  Zipper was broke also. No stretch at all.
1.0,Bought this for my 12 year old. Watch didn't last a month. The strap broke. Now he's asking for another one and I just spent on this one a little over a month ago.
1.0,"Way to short. No length really given for the fit. If you're into exposed ankles, and preparing for the flood- hey get these!! Not me, nope, sorry."
1.0,Could not find the Keds I usually order so I ordered these.  They are the absolutely most Uncomfortable shoes I have ever bought.  They are hard!  I even bought a pair of Dr. Scholls innersoles and it did not help!!!  Wish I could get my money back!
1.0,Terrible fit. It looked like they took two different sheets of fabric and slapped it together. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Please don't buy this productos, the color is poor it is not like seem to the pic and the fabric is Bad quality. I am upset with this order."
1.0,She says they aren’t any warmer than regular socks.  They are really thin.
1.0,I am very disappointed. They look good but they get runs right away. I wore a pair once and now their trashed. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I was looking forward to wearing these pants during the unbearable heat wave we're going through, but these pants are two sizes too small."
1.0,"The material is poor quality and the size chart in the description is completely wrong. I got a small, says bust size 37”, I wear a 34” so figured it would have some room. I could not even get the shirt over my head. I am slender build, 140lbs, 34” bust. I do not recommend this shirt at all."
1.0,Haven’t even owned 6 months and all the seams are coming apart in the crotch area.<br /><br />Can’t recommend.
1.0,store brand being sold for more then you can get them in the store. thin material. not what i was hoping for.
1.0,See thru and pretty but the arms are extremely tiny.  I wear an 8-10 ordered a large and gave to my 10 yr old
1.0,The print and texture of the fabric was great.  However the sizing is completely off.  My husband is an xl in most all shirts but the xl fit like a medium.  I reordered in xxl and that fit just as horribly.  Maybe if you’re a standard medium size you can find a size invthis shirt that will fit but otherwise you are likely to be disappointed
1.0,If you look at the picture there are several large stains that came on the dress.
1.0,"Poor quality, sequins falling off.  Seller won't issue refund and will NOT pay for return shipping (back to China for $27.75.).  Totally defective item, and they want buyer to pay for shipping.  DON'T buy this product or from the Seller."
1.0,difficult to change the pom pom severe design flaw
1.0,"it only has a clear coat over a nickel buckle. It was fine for about 2 months, but after the clearcoat wore off a bit, I started getting a rash. I bought a carbon fiber buckle and have not had any rashes ever since."
1.0,"Incomplete order, 2 of the bales were off of the  supposed malakite, Which is actually glass or plastic, most likely plastic"
1.0,Silver washed off the tips
1.0,Not only do these not feel like your sandals or clogs but they're not even as supportive as the Keene insoles that came with the shoes that I used them in. After my first day in these I was so relieved to take them off. I'd feel better about stuffing a wet rag into my shoes before a hike than these insoles.
1.0,"This is a cute concept, but worked horribly. My son loves the hulk, the colors are great.... but when worn you can’t tell what it is."
1.0,Very cheap. Not at all like the picture. Gave it to my 13 year old niece.
1.0,Tore within a few months
1.0,"Actually returned it , looked richer on website , not I thought it would be ."
1.0,"Size is way off, normally I wear a size large I got xlarge and gave it to my friend who normally wear medium"
1.0,Fell off my wrist.....
1.0,Very uncomfortable shoe.  Feels like you are walking on rocks.
1.0,"Whatever you do, don't buy these.  They ripped getting into my car, and they the only issue in a refund if you pay the shipped them back to China, which in excess of the price of the shorts.  I've been extorted."
1.0,I ordered an XL and received a small. I requested a replacement and received a size small again. Too bad because the suit is so cute and made well.
1.0,Feels like plastic and the sole is so flimsy and thin you bruise your foot on every pebble.  Looks great but sucks for comfort.
1.0,Way too small. Ordered one size up and still needed to return. Trying two sizes up now.
1.0,"The description should state what size they are. The way it is shown in the picture is so misleading and it says it’s a bracelet, which I thought was all one piece. Came out to be 4 bangles. It should say that it’s not an adult size. Those bangles are for a 4 year old. I shopped in the “women “ section for a reason."
1.0,ordered two and only received one.
1.0,Necklace turned color/tarnished within the first couple days of wear. Don’t buy unless you’re fine with wearing it once and throwing it out.
1.0,Bought this for my 5 year old it looked like it was for a 24 month old. Way too small!
1.0,Turquoise and silver pieces came off after wearing twice
1.0,Had these for about a week and the very first time I washed them with glasses cleaner this is what happened…whoever is selling these on Amazon IS NOT the ‘blenders’ company… I reached out to the actual company and they said they do not sell their sunglasses on Amazon
1.0,Fit was okay. Very cheap and itchy material.
1.0,The pants fit fine but if I would have read the reviews like I usually do I would have never bought it period it was a birthday gift I won't even get to wear amazon should really choose better vendors
1.0,"This dress fits weird and the stitching makes the stripes look uneven. It might be ok as a maternity dress, but the gathering where the stripes meet the black bottom part falls at a strange spot on my body. Feels more like I’m wearing a sack. Not sure if getting a smaller size would help with that, but the poor stitching was a deal breaker. I suppose if you tie the bow in the front it could hide it, but it still bugs me. Sent back."
1.0,"Nice looking belt.  Color matches my shoes.  However, after six month of occasionally use, the belt is coming apart at the notch hole,"
1.0,"The reviews said runs small so I got a size up XL, not only did it not fit I gave it to my preteen that can wear an extra extra small, quality not good and not happy with product. Too difficult to refurnished for the cost so kept it for a 13 year old -- if you're a normal M or L woman I suggest order a 4X or not at all"
1.0,Ordered a Large and received a small and very little stretch to the band
1.0,This is the second time I’ve purchased a rose gold necklace from this seller but this time around the necklace began to fade within two weeks. I reached out to the seller but received a stupid response as to why the necklace is fading so quickly.
1.0,Blocks the signal from key fob to vehicle. Have even had while I'm driving all the sudden say no key fob detected. I have a 2021 Grand Cherokee
1.0,"Chinese crap.<br /><br />The ties, like mentioned here already, smell like petrol and they also feature spots (they were dirty as in weren't clean)"
1.0,"The sleeves are to short not long sleeves like it says, only looks good if you push up sleeves.  And after one wear the sleeves look worn already."
1.0,"I bought the large, returned it for the XL, and then returned that for the XXL. And got an XL. I’m never buying from this company again. The sizing is too small, they’re not quite Asian sizing but close. The tags are  in an Asian language which leads me to believe the sizing runs small. I KNOW I ordered an XXL and now it says I ordered an XL WHEN I ALREADY HAD THAT SIZE AND SENT IT BACK. I’m so annoyed. The shirt is cute but this isn’t worth it."
1.0,Broke immediately!
1.0,Item was wrong . Worst amazon history.
1.0,Runs very small. Bought an  XXL looks more like a Large.
1.0,"This top is a waffle knit, but it is completely see through. I tried layering a cami underneath, but that showed through too much as well. The fit and style was great, but I returned it."
1.0,The fabric is awful.
1.0,"Liked the way they fit, design etc but broke after one week of wear. I took them off my head and the side snapped right off. I guess you get what you pay for"
1.0,They are not high wasted at all. Good pair of work jeans and material is good
1.0,"The item is very misleading. It is advertised with the model wearing 2 of the items like barefoot bracelets. It comes up under that search, however after order, I only received one. Its like ordering shoes, thinking your getting the left and the right foot and realizing each shoe is sold separately.  2 would had been worth the $13 but 2 for $26 is a rip off. Its a string n beads."
1.0,"Wasn't stretchy material where my bun tried to go through, didn't even wear it due to this. The elastic feels like regular fabric, has no stretch or give. Not worth it."
1.0,Could not attach to watch
1.0,"ESTE PRODUCTO NO ME GUSTO PARA NADA , DESEO ME DINERO DEVUELTA, LA PIEZA ESTA TAN FAGIL Y FINITA QUE TIENE UN VALOR DE 25 CENTAVOS"
1.0,"The fit on this is terrible; way too big around the lower waist and hips to be a small. It even fits too loosely around the armpits. I'm going to have to take it in so it doesn't bag around my stomach.<br /><br />Even worse, this is NOT a cotton-blend. The tag says 95% polyester and 5% spandex! I am very upset about this! I ordered this shirt in spite of its higher cost specifically because the bullet said it was a cotton blend. Very, very disappointed; I hate wearing synthetic fibers."
1.0,I can’t leave a negative star review or I would. This item looked nothing like the pictures. It was cheap fabric and the “rhinestones” are iridescent sequins. I had to fight with the seller and Amazon to get a return address not in china that wasn’t more than the cost of the dress to return. I am still out $17 for return shipping. I would not purchase the white dress.
1.0,"Just got this bracelet. Ordered it like a month, or more ago. Not even the right bracelet. I got an all black, ugly bracelet that says best friends on it. Not very happy at all. I want my money back."
1.0,Got a double x still won't fit. Normally wear medium or large
1.0,"It broke right away. It was super cute, but the material is really cheap."
1.0,"This item is inaccurately described as a  ""romper"". It's a dress. Will be returning it.  The fabric is not bad, but the lining is on the heavy side and it wouldn't work for hot weather as it'd be clingy.  I don't want a dress."
1.0,Poor quality. Lays poorly at neckline. Washed it and my black wrap came out grey then the color came off on my hands and stained my fingernails. Very disappointing.
1.0,This is awfully cheap - it literally broke within 3 minutes of unwrapping it. Save your money.
1.0,Unclear vision.
1.0,"once I got the earrings in and tried to put the backs that were provided, the plastic stems ripped and so I couldn't use them. They worked if there was not earring in them because I tested it first."
1.0,"Bought for my husband and the ""paint"" chipped after trying 1 time the balls wouldn't stay on no matter what we tried"
1.0,"Disappointed with the color--,it was not rich--very drab. Wish I had returned it."
1.0,I ordered a size up and still didn't fit!
1.0,Extremely small...followed the sizing chart which already seemed a little off but ordered a 3x (I'm a womens size 20w) and the waist is 15 inches wide when you hold it up without stretching it...when you stretch it out its 22 inches maximum. In US sizes this would be a small. Tags are in another language (Taiwan).
1.0,"low quality, stain on hat upon arrival, patch loose on edges."
1.0,These are flimsy and not the color advertised
1.0,"Really don't like this shoe. It has zero cushion in the ball of the foot. I get a lot of pain in my feet when running. I got these to replace my Asic Gel Nimbus 17, which I loved. They were like running on a cloud. Unfortunately, Asics seems to have cheaped out on the quality of their latest versions with very little gel in the shoes. I guess to cut costs they now only put a small amount in the heal and very little to none in the toe. Very disappointing Asics, looks like I'll have to look for a new brand of shoes."
1.0,the bottom is so narrow it's like walking on an ice skate I ordered a size 9 which looked and fit like a size 7
1.0,"This dress was not at all the size listed. It fit the child, but was super short."
1.0,I am a true 18/20 and the xxl is to small.
1.0,"This swimsuit looks so cute on the model! But it did not fit me well at all. The problem is that the fabric is not very elasticized. It is bunchy and does not cling like a swimsuit should. It fits more like a Tank top would.<br /><br />The sizing was a little bit large. I sized up based on the reviews and found that it was probably a touch too big. Maybe I’m not busty enough.<br /><br />My last complaint is that the cup inserts are very hard and small and round. Instead of covering your breasts naturally, they create a puffy round circle around the center. They’re just not the right kind of foam or the right size. The overall effect was looking deformed instead of sexy."
1.0,"Wow,I ordered 8/10 in this and when it arrived it was like a 2/4! I gave it to my daughter who wears a 4 and she said that was way to small for a med.8/10 it was even a little bit small on her, sizing way off!"
1.0,Package may be lost. SMH
1.0,"ackward, large fit"
1.0,Sending back
1.0,"You definitely get what you pay for with these; they cost less than $15, and the quality reflects that.<br /><br />The waist band is a 1&#34; wide elastic band, it isn't even sewn into the pants. Instead, its just a loop that slides around inside the waist part of the pants, free to twist and move as it wants. The fabric is coarse, and doesn't have that normal soft stretch that a pair of yoga pants would normally have. I ended up purchasing a Medium and a Large, just to make sure that the butt part wasn't see-through in an appropriately-sized pair (which maybe a sizing up would solve). No matter the size, these leggings had a bad case of see-through butt.. and that's not really my thing.<br /><br />If you're thinking about purchasing these, just...don't."
1.0,I am livid these dug into her skin on the first round of wearing them. Listen to the comments.. LISTEN TO ME (some random mom) because I know that YOU should not purchase these! Now I have to get into my car in this summer heat and drive down to Kohl’s to return them.
1.0,I bought this June 12thand it broke by June 30th! Didn't even wear it that long!
1.0,"This shirt is way too large, needs returned. Very disappointed."
1.0,I’m sick and I’m bed a lot and these looked like they would be perfect pajamas the pants were true to size and comfortable BUT the shirt wouldn’t go on it was so tight and showed my belly I’m not that huge but I was so disappointed ☹️
1.0,The size was about 4 times smaller than it was suppose to be. 3xl was a med. And it took a very long time to recieve.
1.0,I bought the light pink and it looks like pajamas. The material is really thin and doesn’t look like “clothes” at all. Very disappointed.
1.0,This outfit was nothing like the pictures. The back of the top is sheer. The back of the skirt is also sheer with a solid white thing underneath. Disappointed and must return!
1.0,It was okay but not what is shown online.
1.0,They were not even the same style of glasses as the picture. Very cheap and flimsy. Would not record buying these.
1.0,Way too small. Good for a lilliputian.
1.0,It was very small for the size ordered
1.0,"Very flimsy, very small.....wouldn't order from them again.  I feel it is mis-advertised"
1.0,Broken when they arrived. Very disappointed.
1.0,This product runs extremely way to small
1.0,"After a year I'm back to add to my initial review the plastic seat cracked and broke, good as I had learned to hate it's shape and my feet going to sleep every time I sat on it for more than twenty minutes (9-8-2014) rating a one. Seat and back are plastic but seam to be strong enough. I gave a four rating only because my butt is a little wider than the seat another two or three inches in seat width would be better or maybe two or three inches less in butt width."
1.0,Took months to go away. Happened despite multiple washings
1.0,Absolutely waste of my money! kids  shoe sizes dont match what this measures them at.
1.0,Deceptive description of shorts. Poor quality. Lots of ravelins. Stated cotton in ad but there were multiple warnings on label how to not wash due to multiple fabrics. Actually suggeted to wash seldom! Lol!! Also label said size 34...i ordered womens 10. Hummmm
1.0,"TWO of the Rings broke the first time trying them on. I'm left with the gold one. Cheaply made, ot worth the purchase."
1.0,"It was not a correct description. It is NOT 925 Sterling Sliver. If you had sticks for wrists and a neck it would fit you perfectly. I ended up giving to granddaughter since she is a stick with legs. It made her happy and that's is all that counts. But Please be honest with your description. My jeweler said that if it was real it would have a very tiny stamp that would say 925 or SS HIDDEN on the piece, a round tag on the clasp is a huge give away!&#34;"
1.0,Fit weirdly on my body -- bathing suit material.
1.0,Really wanted these to be great but they fell apart on the very 1st use. Daughter wore them at the beach and the inside came out and sand got in an all the crevices and they were taken off within 5 minutes.
1.0,I am not crazy about this item. I wouldn't carry a lot of cards in it. Taking the band on and off
1.0,I sent it back. It was awful. Very cheap looking.
1.0,"Fabric feels good.  But the point was having the Ghostbusters logo on it....  When you sew a seam through the face, it no longer looks like Ghostbusters, looks more like Spermbusters or something now.... I Will not wear this"
1.0,I washed it one time and the strands holding up the pants already fell apart! She never even got to wear it! Don’t buy. Waste of money
1.0,"Within 1 week of using these, a hole ripped through one of the gloves, exposing a thumb. I used them for pulling weeds. Not worth it. Next time, I'll buy more expensive ones."
1.0,Terrible!
1.0,It didn’t fit me quite right. It didn’t flatter my shape. I have a little tummy.
1.0,"Read reviews, triple checked the size chart even have a similar swimsuit from a different seller, do not shop with this company! highly disappointed! Measurements aren’t even what they are listed to be as I had to measure when looking at the bathing suit Because I was sure they had to be off! Will not be purchasing anything from this company again ever!"
1.0,Cheap cheap flimsy
1.0,Got this for my girl she is size median when they arrive it was super small
1.0,Very dissapointed. This is not 999 sterling silver.<br />It peeled to a different color metal.
1.0,"Way to orange,even with the correct gray sealer"
1.0,"After wearing the tights once, there were not just one hole, but three holes near the toes! Wow I have not worn something that fragile in a really long time. Will never buy this brand again. What a waste of money!"
1.0,"This mask is so large that even Jay Leno would say it's entirely too big. If you ask for a refund, they will only offer $5."
1.0,I was really disappointed! It looks so yellow and I waited too long to exchange it! I am sick I paid that much for it!
1.0,These were extremely short. Looked like they were for kids.
1.0,"Very disappointed. It's much smaller than the chart. So, I feel that Amazon isn't verifying quality sellers and that the reviews aren't accurate. I was looking forward to this item. The XL Is 13 inches flat so 23 inches at its widest point. I really wanted to wear to a NYE wedding, now o have to figure out how to return it."
1.0,I usually give every thing I poke the full 5 stars. My only issue is that it took over a month to receive. The customer service just kept telling to wait. The first waiting period was 14 days and did not include weekends or holidays. After this I was told to wait again. They were ordered in June and I got them today. Go figure.
1.0,Is not true to size. Fit very poorly. Bought a large and the fit was like a small. I wonder if it was mislabeled?
1.0,I don't like this at all. Looks so wierd on my husbands finger. I can't stand it. Won't be wearing them. Waste of money
1.0,"Like the others have said, the quality is poor.  It is very small, very short and very thin.  It's not worth what they are asking.  It's not worth half.  I think it's a shame for those who are true fans of the movie to be swindled in such a way.  Seriously?  Put some effort and pride in your product."
1.0,NOT TRUE SIZE. runs big thankfully  I was able to return
1.0,THIS IS NOT A HAT. I ordered 2 of these for costume pieces for a show and both times what showed up were 2 small scarves with shamrocks on them. They weren’t even green.  Something is wrong with this listing.
1.0,I received the glasses with missing parts. Useless!!!!
1.0,Do not like it!
1.0,"My daughter walked outside to the car in them and didn’t make it into the car before they fell apart. Brand new, fell apart."
1.0,"Not cute. I ordered the hoodie set and the off the shoulder set. Both, had thick elastic waistbands and ankle bands.  The material looks like flame retardant kids pajama material. Boxy, poorly made."
1.0,I ordered the 2XL but is much smaller than expected. The measurements on their size chart are not accurate.<br />Fits more like a medium than a 2XL.
1.0,"First, the dress fits quite nicely. I tried it on with a petticoat and I could practically float. Now, for the bad news. The clear or white mesh at the bottom is some sort of yucky creamy taupe khaki color. Buy a dress without the mesh design and without the white. This is the second time I've ordered and I don't think these people know what the color white is supposed to look like."
1.0,"This show is poorly made, I wore it once and the inside is flakey. The front of shoe cuts into your foot. There is no flexibility once so ever."
1.0,"It looks like plastic, sounds like plastic (when you shake the bracelet) and feels like plastic... guess what... IT IS PLASTIC!!!<br />There is no certification of the stones, so it is up to you if you believe you ware a genuine tourmaline bracelet. If you believe you have the real one maybe it works for you as placebo."
1.0,"Small, and Bad Quality."
1.0,I don’t like this dress at all. It’s see through and the top part has a taped line (best way to describe it. Like when you peel off a price tag sticker?) right on the front part of the chest. The dress gives off a boxy top look. I’ll try to post a picture later on.
1.0,"This broke first day and I have two other similar bracelets I wear on each wrist that were even less expensive. Beads went everywhere so I couldn't even restring it or send it back for a refund. I really liked it too. I think it is just not made well. The beads looked really cool and porous which I liked. Not the traditional polished beads. The tigers eye was, but the black lava beads were really neat.<br /><br />Going to local craft store to see if I can make my own."
1.0,"Typical Made in China junk: low cost, low quality.  I can't believe we American consumers keep buying/settling for this crap.<br /><br />Great deal if they all worked but 17 of 30 were non-functional.  So, for me, it's the inconvenience of not knowing from order to order, how many you need to buy, how long they'll last, etc.  I'm pretty fed up with supporting the sweat-shops in 3rd World nations that make items for sale to the U.S., knowing that we'll keep on buying from them regardless.  I'm only one person but I'm done with that."
1.0,"Watch came in with broken stem.  Not suppliers fault, shame, it was a nice looking watch."
1.0,I ordered an XL for someone who always wears an XL and they fit fine. The fabric in these swim trunks seems cheap. This is not an XL in USA. Standards.  This would be more like a men’s medium for North America body shape.
1.0,I love this shirt in black so I figured I’d order it in white same shirt same size and it was at least three sizes smaller.
1.0,Too small and returned it
1.0,"1 Star-----The printing of the picture came out blurry and had what I would describe as overspray. I would not care if they were for me, but they were gifts. I got 2 and both were a mess."
1.0,"would probably work, but I can't stand to wear it.  The chin strap is too wide and it feels like it is either constricting my neck or over my mouth."
1.0,Was not like the picture
1.0,Very disappointed. Ears turned green and the posts both bent right away.
1.0,This is a great looking bag! At first I loved it even though the zipper seemed to be a little harder to pull towards the middle. After 2 months it totally broke. Not acceptable for that price.
1.0,Pad barely heats up.
1.0,Gets rusty within a few weeks not a good buy 0 stars
1.0,The sole of the sandal began coming loose during the first wear. Returning for a refund!
1.0,It was such a cute blouse but it was huge ! No tapering at all.
1.0,They are pretty but they will not stay up
1.0,My band took several days to ship and when it arrived it was clearly not a BluShark product.  Something called straply.  Returning this asap.
1.0,I ordered a 6-12 months for my son that's 6 months old and it bearly fits. Completely horrible because it's supposed to be for a photoshoot
1.0,Just go buy Under Armor.  These ride up and aren't good for working out.
1.0,"I absolutely loved these until I came out to my car the other day and they were cracked, pretty disappointed. Its been warm here but I wouldnt have guessed they would crack. :( I have only had them a few months and took good care of them. They are super comfortable but they need to last longer than that for what they cost."
1.0,This watch stopped after two days. I am going to try to get a new battery- not work the money.
1.0,This item arrived packed suctioned flat in a bag. It had clearly been stored in sunlight because when I unwrapped it there was a large white faded patch all across the middle of the back. It was totally unwearable.  I was appalled by the quality.<br />Will never by from the company again
1.0,Only 2 of the 3 arrived
1.0,The metallic stuff on the silver ring rubbed off in spots the first day at work. Not worth buying
1.0,"The dress was very cute, but the bottom half of it was completely see through (which I didn’t notice until we got to the church and it was obviously too late, thankfully I put her in a pull-up) and the top half wasn’t actually white in color at all. It was cream/super light beige. The detail was gorgeous until the little flowers started to fall off while my daughter walked down the aisle mid ceremony😒 if she hadn’t noticed it would’ve been fine, but she stopped and picked them up and started crying and tried to put them back on. I only gave 1 star because it got here on time, but this was a disaster of a dress. The fit was ok but my kids super skinny (28 pounds 3 foot 4 inches and 3 1/2 years old) and it was a bit snug on her"
1.0,This is my second heated vest. The first one only cost $21 and I returned it for a larger size but the price shot up $10 so I looked for a better one. This vest claims it has 9 heating units but all don’t seem to work and they produce little heat even on a high setting. More expensive vest properly work better if your willing to pay the high price. Due your research!!!!!
1.0,Band comes off when it magnates to other metals. Example I’m pulling clothes out of washers it will magnates to washer. Magnifies to car and come off. Not good. I liked the way it looks.
1.0,Material was very flimsy and the pattern did not match up well at the seams.  They charged for the return even though it says that they don't.  Sleeves were too long as well.
1.0,Don't keep feet any warmer
1.0,Awful quality.  Hand washed it once and it fell apart. Don't waste your money.
1.0,My daughter opened this Christmas Day as a gift I bought 3 different colors in the same order. I washed and placed them in the dryer like we do with all new clothing and they came out as toddler size 2/3 I would not pay .25 for these. Not even worth a dish rag. I strongly suggest not buying.
1.0,Way to small for your fingers and you cannot get the ball to screw on because it's so itty-bitty.. it's smaller than a belly ring ball.. pry half the size.. super small
1.0,"These just arrived a few minutes ago. There's no way that these are cotton, let alone organic cotton. These are silky like polyester (the tag is in Chinese, so I can't tell what it says) and stretchy like there's Lycra or spandex in them."
1.0,"They broke ,Very cheap"
1.0,Very very cheaply made and wayyy too small
1.0,Wtf this wastes people time
1.0,Broke quickly after I put it on my band.  It still works but I am in fear that it will soon fall off.
1.0,This bracelet broke about a week after I bought it. Very disappointed. This bracelet is designed to soak the lava beads in essential oils. Bracelet was very pretty but it broke and I lost all the beads. Disappointed I wasted the money.
1.0,"Zipper on the right hand glove was broke when I received them. One star, poor quality gloves!"
1.0,Was really short for a 5”5 person 115 lbs
1.0,The item SUCKS. This item needs to be moved to the children (4-6 size )section. This is not an adult size. I needed up giving this the my niece to use as part of her dress up outfits. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this item. Please remove off the Amazon site.
1.0,"This was way too small, the measurements on the size chart are not correct at all"
1.0,I loved the gloves but when I got them they had tan on the pointer finger not sure why or if can be taken off! This tan is not shown in the pictures it looks very funny
1.0,I don’t dislike it at all I’m trying to switch it to rose gold I clicked the wrong one. And it’s not going to match the tuxedo for this professional organizer expensive event we’ve been working on for a few months it’s important that I switch it to gold rose gold
1.0,VERY POOR QUALITY DRESS.MADE AS OF SCRACHY PAPER.GOD I HAVEN'T SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON.IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME!
1.0,Super cute shirt but sizing is incorrect.... more like 2/3 sizes smaller than actually ordered.
1.0,Huge ugly lenses - definitely not what was expected
1.0,I only used It's one time! It doesn't get worse to buy it.
1.0,Very see through. Bigger than a usual small romper is on me. I am 120 lb & 5’7 for reference. Material was super cheap and the bottom was frayed. Stitching was cheap.
1.0,Very thin very cheaply made i returned immediately !
1.0,The package arrived and it was empty!  This is a first for me. I just opened a package with nothing in it. At least it wasn’t an expensive item. Ugh.
1.0,"This is the first time I am truly disappointed with children's PJs I purchased from Amazon. They were not marked with sizes, but rather a tag inside that says 100 and 110.  I'm hoping the 100 is the 4 T an d the 110 is the 5T. One of the plastic bag packages was opened and the socks were missing. The socks are marked with a K-Mart tag ande the outfit is not. Why? I thought K-Mart is no longer in business. The outfit is cute, but I'm not sure it's going to fit my grandchildren because the size is not marked on either pair so I'm not sure what I received. May have to send this back."
1.0,Wayyy too long
1.0,"Beautiful but they broke when I tried them on. Also they are not hypoallergenic, I am very allergic to nickel and my skin had an almost immediate reaction."
1.0,"OH.MA.LAWD. this sweatshirt is so tiny!  I ordered an XL, which should've been plenty big and, I swear, it's a child's XL!  It's cute, the sizing is just wonky. Going back."
1.0,"Read the costume letters. It does not say ""average joes"" and is a counterfeit. Headbands are awkward and look like hair ties."
1.0,I ordered this and got it in only to see an emblem of what appears to be a Russian flag? Is this for reals? No where w/in the description does it mention a flag sewn onto the jacket.
1.0,Does not look like picture. Not made of cotton. Made of polyester.
1.0,Runs a size small and not giving even though it’s knit.
1.0,"Low quality, nothing like the pic"
1.0,Returning made on China bad bad usa☹️☹️☹️
1.0,"These ripped after the second wearing, in multiple places - under the arm, in the crotch from front to back. Terrible construction. Would actually like my money back but too late for a refund. Do yourself a favor and NEVER purchase these!"
1.0,"Neck design is too transparent, hope some lining there"
1.0,Dont waste your money on buying this product.  It's made of very cheap material.
1.0,This top is completely see though and the fit is just horrible. I’m tall and have long arms and the sleeves were so long on me. The twist part was especially bad quality and didn’t sit nice on my chest.
1.0,"I ordered the 5pcs semi precious lebret piercings, and I was only shipped 4 of them. Not happy!"
1.0,These are so thin and tear very easily. Extra cheaply made.
1.0,I ordered a large and they fit like an XS.... I couldn't even get them on.
1.0,I have been trying to unsanp this for weeks! It will not come out
1.0,"I buy these passports all of the time, I personalize them as gifts so I've purchased approx 20 so far. They must have changed the quality because of all of the ones I received in my last order (I purchased 6), only one had the ""utrip"" logo stamped on it, which is what I'm used to. The new ones do not have the logo and they are much thinner and cheaper than the ones I've ordered previously. I need to check to see if I'm ordering from the same vendor as some of these vendors use other vendor's photos and it's not the same product. As you can see, the purple I received looks nothing like the purple pictured. I can deal with the other colors (pink, red, black), but my blue and purple was totally different and this makes a difference when you're trying to match school colors."
1.0,"The necklace looked good when it arrived, but the gold finish was gone by the time I had worn it four times. Now the chain is a dull gray. Unfortunately, I had given one as a gift as well. Very disappointing. I wish I had not bought two of these necklaces. I can't figure out how to attach the photo."
1.0,This is the 2nd time I got these earring and they have been bent when they came. I returned them and they still came like this again
1.0,Extremely cheap looking. Looks like it came out of a gum-ball machine !
1.0,I do not like that they are NOT compression as stated in description<br />I wanted compression tops for gym
1.0,broke with in a week
1.0,Not layered very thin I don’t recommend at all
1.0,"I have several of these bracelets. Most fit great. Some are too big and I adjust them to size. I have tiny wrists. I can wear childrens bracelets. This one however is way too small. The string is big enough, but there isn't much to the rest of the bracelet like the others. The others go around my wrist. This bracelet may be better for a 3 year old. Or maybe just mine is defective. I guess I'll never know. It sold out after I bought mine."
1.0,The arms were blurry tight and it looked like a bath robe
1.0,The cups are extremely small for a XXL and the straps are so thin they feel like they’re going to snap off.
1.0,The wording was incorrect. I did not get what I requested nor did it arrive at the promised time
1.0,I did not like this item at all. It looks like it was just thrown together and they are not true to size. Will not be buying again
1.0,Honestly I don’t even recall getting this item.This was a birthday gift for my son last year and I don’t even recall receiving it.
1.0,"El material era muy caliente , la parte superior"
1.0,Construction was very cheap and Parts fell off of it almost immediately.
1.0,Is it good that my baby can go to sleep at night with this t shirt? When is the best time to wear it?
1.0,"Cheaply constructed, falls apart with minimal tension on buckle holes, feels stretchy and light, doesn’t fit like a real leather belt."
1.0,Mever got this product. Takes more time on my part ti ca and make rhem deli er this. But wint buy this again
1.0,Literally a pair of scrubs
1.0,I ordered a size XL it was more like a med.. very disappointed gave to my daughter who wears size 8
1.0,If you have thick thighs they will not stay unless you wear a guarder belt!
1.0,This skirt was absolutely horrendous. The sizing is way off the charts; I ordered a M and it wouldn’t go past my lower thighs. The color and overall fit is not flattering either.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:708219f4c0a77873df3f111c6f0ce048]] These are advertised as adjustable but the second I trie to make it larger it split and it’s now broken. I wouldn’t recommend it if you have a ring size above a 7. I use a size 9.
1.0,Very disappointed. I ordered this outfit in a size 12-15mo for my son’s first WILD ONE birthday party very cute and soft but the onesie is terribly big on the neck it sags- on all my pictures it looks bad I had to end up changing the baby to something different. I wish that I was able to return and get my money back!!
1.0,"Of course I love my Prime Membership. However, this time I was highly disappointed. Order this dress for my mother to wear on Mother’s Day. It is a short dress (nothing at all like the picture) and it’s huge....not happy at all with this purchase and will be returning ASAP"
1.0,"I ended up buying two pairs of these from Shoewhatever and should have SAVED MY MONEY WHATEVER!!!! I bought the first pair for myself. They came, looked cute, fit well but had a broken rubber band that was supposed to attach to the side button. I requested a return and bought another pair to replace them because they're so cute. Shoewhatever replied that I could return them for a refund but I would have to pay to ship them...nahhh, I don't want to pay for shipping to return their broken product back to them...I will try to rig a repair on my own. I tried to cancel the second pair but it had already shipped so I gave them to my kiddo for Christmas. The second pair that came are completely different than the first pair...have a metal plaque on the back heel that says AMY and says AMY on the buttons. Mine are blank and do not have a plaque. Fine but weird. Wore my new cute boots ONCE...from inside my home to inside for dinner about two hours. Put them in my closet. Took them out of my closet to wear yesterday and the other shoe (not the one I have already repaired) has the top button completely gone and the second button pulled and almost falling off. So now I wait to see what falls apart next and what will fall off my kiddos boots.They are cheaply made,poor quality, not great customer service and inconsistent products. Buyer Beware!"
1.0,Shoulders were too tight . Cost to much to send it back . Won’t use them again.
1.0,"I ordered a large they sent me a medium mediums too small I am 5, 11 178 pounds the large would have been perfect Graphics are great on this shirt though that part is going to cost me $4 to send it back"
1.0,Mask arrived with missing spring in the battery box which is required for the batteries to make contact and light the mask.  Stuck with a defective mask because it cannot be returned.  As another reviewer stated - do not buy this mask because they are defective and seller not willing to stand behind their product.
1.0,Not good quality for the money
1.0,Too small and sorry I bought next size up Too hard to put on and off. Was not happy with them
1.0,"I am not sure if the top and bottom ball are also surgical steel because after the first day of wearing these, my piercing got hard, swollen, and very itchy. I am allergic to nickel and was wearing the one covered in rhinestones...maybe there is nickel in the stone settings?<br />Super upset because these are SUPER cute"
1.0,Likes cheap price nice appearance dislikes the Pins fall off very easily making it Impossible for my daughter to change out bands.
1.0,"I feel like this was super big. If you like that style, this is for you. If you want a tighter beanie buy a different one"
1.0,These are not genuine stones. The &#34;jade&#34; on my bracelet was ink or some sort of dye that washed off.
1.0,My keychain broke after 2 days
1.0,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my husband so I don’t have an opinion yet.  But I love the colors.
1.0,Bought a XXL because I thought it would run small....should of bought a 5X. The XXL is equal to a large at best. This just assures me that I won't buy shirts off Amazon
1.0,The picture looks nice but it's horrible
1.0,Very thin does not provide rain coverage I got all wet.
1.0,Description was not correct
1.0,Received my ring today. Huge disappointment. Falsely advertised. This is not silver at all. At best it is silver look. Stone is not real. Not even CZ.  The size is 1-1.5 sized too small.  The only positive is that it’s pretty.
1.0,"Very pretty, but very fragile. I wore once before it broke. Good price, but SO not worth it when you'll wear it once. Take a couple extra bucks and buy a quality one. Not here."
1.0,Cheap looking pendant.
1.0,"It is very poor quality and the embroidered word was misspelled. I thought the hat would be blue to match the gloves, however, it was black. I will return the product. I had to assign a star. It should be minus five."
1.0,Long posts.  Hard to screw onto your ear.  Very heavy.<br />Look nice.<br />Perfect for a child
1.0,"Nice buckle, but absolutely NOT what I received. The image is does not match the item. NOT what I asked for."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:9319d73eadd62c053576a854086dc668]] Son botas casuales, muy lindas y cómodas pero a la segunda vez que las usas se rompe n las suelas, es un fraude"
1.0,"The band broke so easily, my wife only wore it for half a day"
1.0,"Ordered a 5x and it doesn't fit my mother, who is a an extra large! Wouldn't suggest this product to anyone!👿"
1.0,I didn't like how fake it looked.  Too white silver..
1.0,"After waiting more than 2 weeks for this to actually I arrive, I tried it out on one of my 4AM, Florida, 85° mornings - yes AM. I sweat a ton, to the point I look like I've stepped out of a pool every single day at work or working out.  It slipped off my head before I even started. I replaced it, and began my run. While it didn't come off again (the sweat must of offered the rubber grips something to hold on to better.) It did absolutely nothing to keep sweat out of my eyes, and there was zero cooling effect whatsoever. Complete waste of money for what a $1 normal headband would offer."
1.0,"Totally smaller than shown in the picture, very short.  Arrived in a wrinkled mess."
1.0,total waste of money don't buy unless it's for a 12 yr old kid.
1.0,"As previous poster said, this is supposed to be a size large hat. Unfortunately I also received a size small 0-12M which is not what I need. We love MillyMook hats (we have this same hat in size 0-12M) and it fit perfectly, provided enough coverage and was absolutely adorable. MillyMook is a great company for anyone interested in ordering, it appears this hat should be listed as a S."
1.0,"A joke. Ordered big, still too small, this is for children, not adults."
1.0,I’m totally disappointed in this purchase. The fit is terrible. It’s just a dress and not a leotard. I purchased a youth size 11 and it would easily fit an adult. I just missed the window to return because it’s a busy time of year. Next time I won’t even consider this brand.
1.0,Runs small deff size up I’m short  only 5’5and it wasn’t long enough
1.0,"Orange is not Clemson Tiger ""Orange""...it is a peach color - do not purchase and is small in size!!<br /><br />Do not purchase."
1.0,I ordered a small.  It was enormous!  Not attractive at all.
1.0,"Purchased this as gift for my husband,  he really liked the watch. The problem is that watch does not keep time. Its either running fast or slow. Thought maybe the battery needs to be changed. Looked at the sellers listed information, states 1- Lr44 battery.  Dont waste your time going out and buying one, the sellers listed information in false. This takes 2 batteries and neither are a Lr44 battery. Very disappointed to give my husband a gift that doesn't work correctly, and having to waste my time buying a battery that isn't even used in the watch. I Will be returning this product. Don't waste your time(no pun intended) with this watch."
1.0,S sweater was short and neck was a small V. Definitely didn’t hang off the shoulder. Sent back right away.
1.0,The cap is to soft slips off the head an the buttons don't hold the mask won't order those again they feel too cheep an look it too
1.0,"This was my first item that I have ever purchased online and I was so happy when it came in the mail.  The moment I opened the package though, the necklace thing broke so I ended up putting it on a chain that I had.  After awhile, it bend a bit and when I tried to re-adjust it, it broke.  Not only did they lie and say that it was metal, they also didn't put in the description whether or not it was an item meant to be out of the package.  Another thing is that it isn't Cloud's necklace, it is Vincent's.  And revisiting the metal aspect, it is like some cheap metal alloy that you can break if you just put pressure on it. I wouldn't buy from Q Things ever again."
1.0,Material is awful it’s shiny omg
1.0,Stones were extremely mismatched. I expected some differences because they're chips but these are so higgledy piggledy in shape and size with no attention paid to construction or placement. It renders them so ugly and unmatched as to be unwearable. And they were supposed to be pink quartz but these are cloudy clear not pink. Save your money.
1.0,"Very poorly made, eye is hot glued on. Hopefully I find one better somewhere soon"
1.0,This is definitely not what you think you're getting I actually give this zero Stars I do not like it at all the color is off the material is off the stitching is very very cheap
1.0,The whole outfit felt plasticy. The top was so so so low even Tied showed my nipples
1.0,Screws break too easily. Not good quality
1.0,Its a lighter shade than actual picture
1.0,"Do NOT buy from this company,,, no product received, no refund"
1.0,It's nice just to big.
1.0,"Both the first AND replacement pairs of medium-sized tights arrived torn in the crotch.  Apparently, this is not an isolated incident - the tights in question arrived from different sellers, and other reviews on the web, including on Amazon, highlighted the EXACT same issue but for different sizes (important, as this proves the same faulty tights weren’t simply passed around like a hot potato).  I regret giving Fox the benefit of the doubt and not reading reviews before purchasing and exchanging.<br /><br />Fox Racing is pathetic - how can Fox have the audacity to continue slinging $225 ball busters?  Management is clearly inept, as apparent widespread defects in its most premium mtb tights have completely destroyed its brand and reputation to me as a consumer.<br /><br />Very disappointed, as the concept of these tights is brilliant, and only available from Fox in the poorest, and with a most useless build quality."
1.0,Don't buy this. It took forever to get to me and had dirty feathers and string and wire showing. It's hideous and a waste of money.
1.0,"This romper’s material and they way it’s been manufactured is AWFUL! I wore it one time and it literally fell into pieces! The entire right leg has completely come apart and it can’t be fixed or ever worn again. I basically paid for a one time outfit and to trash it afterwards. Do not waste your time, or your hard earned money on this outfit! They’re lucky they got one star. If it were an option they would have ZERO stars!"
1.0,"Far larger than expected.  The setting sits very high.  I have a desk job &wear it on my non-dominate hand.  It gets caught on everything.  If you don't mind a high setting, it does look beautiful."
1.0,Sizing it like a child's size very misleading!  Very unhappy
1.0,THEY RUN SMALL. COULD'VE BOUGHT FOR WAY LESS AT A DISCOUNT.
1.0,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP
1.0,"Pulls my hair out when removing , the little eyelettes on the arms , 😬"
1.0,pants came with no button to close
1.0,"I read the size chart before ordering the blouse. According to the chart and my measurements, I needed an XL. When it arrived, I tried to try it on and it was extremely to small."
1.0,"I receive an empty box, no necklace inside!!!"
1.0,It ticks but does not keep time.
1.0,I ordered this as a gift and when I gave it to her we could not get the earrings to position as they are in the picture. She ended up having to wear them dangling. Would not recommend
1.0,Very hard uncomfortable would not recommend
1.0,"Nice looking breathable band but it will not stay connected to Fitbit Charge 3 device.  Short end stays on just fine, but long end comes apart without pushing release button."
1.0,Poorly made. The lining comes only to the knee. I returned it.
1.0,Beautiful but completely useless<br />Can’t adjust<br />Tried but it’s impossible to cut it<br />Useless
1.0,"Be sure to check if they're not damaged like mine. I attached photos of the black legging which I never wore and as you can see, the crotch area and the area under the waistband is completely ruined. Beware!"
1.0,Do not get. Super cheap material and nothing like the photo<br />Also super short on me. 5’10 140 athletic build/lean
1.0,"They don't stay up like regular compression stocking do.  They're pretty, but that's about it."
1.0,Took over a month to getbthem! And on earring was longer then the other!
1.0,very disappointed that the items shown was not what I receive something totally different
1.0,I ordered a large because I like to wear my house dresses large.  I am a petite person and these dresses are cut very small and barely fit me.  They are also very sheer.
1.0,This item is for a baby it’s way too small
1.0,I purchased the pocket watch for our 25th wedding anniversary which was the end of May.  The watch keeps stopping and does not work.  Return date passed the end of May which was very disappointing as I waited to give it to my husband.
1.0,"Returned, way too small! Fabric very stiff and scratchy"
1.0,Stiff scratchy material
1.0,Advertised a different color on amazon product that I was expecting was not correct will return
1.0,Colour not vibrant like picture..
1.0,"I recieved totally wrong item, tried contacting seller but no reply."
1.0,"I ordered this so I would have something “cute” to wear to an event. When it arrived, I was disappointed in the quality. It just looked cheap. I did return it & everything went well."
1.0,"Broken and loose in bottom of shipping box. The other bracelet was in a nice gift box and perfect condition. Beware, they run small. Seller needs to add about an inch to each strand so they fit nicely. But they are nice in color and very pretty. I am a small lady. Small wrist and they are tight."
1.0,It was not 925 silver as in the description.  I returned it.
1.0,"Very disappointed... this decal has to be transferred first to transfer tape before anything... extra step:( extra work which means it easier to mess up!! I prefer one step process as with all my other decals I’ve ordered so far with other sellers, all ya had to do is peel & stick basically.... this is poor a design on their end!!"
1.0,not very good. the size was off as well
1.0,"Horrible fabric,"
1.0,"The picture is very misleading.  Looks very nice however in real life,  this is a very cheap, plastic  rubber smelling purse. Was going to give it to my neice for free up but the quality didn't justify the gift."
1.0,"Shirt size was completely off, material is very thin, not stretch at all, and it's a off in shape."
1.0,"Simply does not work. Fro starters, they don't fit most shoes because of the spacing on the eyelets and they only work with grommet laces, not loop laces like on hikers or modern sneakers. I bought these for my son who is tiny and even he was able to unlatch them as he walked. The magnet does not hold unless you put it so far down on the shoe that the shoe actually falls off when you walk. Do not buy these, they are a total waste of money!!!"
1.0,the plastic part in the back hurt my feet very very badly
1.0,First time I tried to put it on the back completely ripped in half.  Complete waste of money.
1.0,Did not fit over glasses. Way too small.
1.0,"Not a fan at all. Without anything in it it's still way thicker than my old trifold. By the time I got my stuff in there it was just ridiculous. If you like having a stuffed back pocket this is for you. If you just want to carry your stuff around comfortably, not so much."
1.0,"In fairness, if you scroll down through this listing, towards the bottom there's a pic of this on a model that shows how it really looks. I didn't see that till after i received this. I bought it based on the image/measurements at the top of the listing, thinking it would be a crop top that would just barely cover my chest and look cute with a sports bra. In my book, there's nothing fashionable or functional about a hoodie that cuts off mid-chest. It's not nearly as long as stated in the measurements, in the front or back. Will be returning."
1.0,"I can't say whether or not they work because we couldn't get them on properly!<br />Literally the most confusing strap ever invented. Did not have the time nor patience to figure it out. Ended up using a different strap altogether. If you like puzzles, go for it. Otherwise, I'm sure there are better options out there."
1.0,"These are not good quality. They aren't even symmetrical. The ear loop on one side is not always the same size as the ear loop on the other side, making it crooked on your face. I would not buy these again."
1.0,would of returned if we wouldent of tried these on
1.0,The sweater I received was different than the one pictured. It’s a different material and color. The cuffs aren’t even the same.
1.0,they got tangled up immediately and lost their gold tone
1.0,Ugly and tacky
1.0,I recieved 0 hoops and 3 actual ear crawlers which didn't even reach to my ear piercing holes.
1.0,Very poor quality. Not sewed right. Defective. I do not recommend these headbands.
1.0,"The dress itself is a great dress.  Very pretty, fits a little smaller than size. The reason for my 1 star rating is due to the wrong color dress being sent not only once but twice.  I don't know if there is an issue with the product skew # or human error but very frustrating."
1.0,"I thought this would be a wonderful gift for my ADULT daughter. This is for a young girl, not an adult.  I could not give this to my daughter, it would not have been appropriate at all"
1.0,"The outfit does not fit like advertised. I ordered a 5T. The top is a tight-ish fitting long sleeved dress, not a shirt and the pants fit like 18 months to 2T (very short). The shirt/dress is of decent quality, but the pants are made from incredibly thin material and don't have any tags on them at all to indicate washing instructions or fiber content.<br /><br />This is another case of a company stealing photos of a boutique item and selling cheaply made, ill fitting knockoffs that look vaguely similar."
1.0,This product DOES NOT fit the TicWatch Pro as described. The item photos are obviously renderings posted before the product was manufactured. Incredibly disappointed.
1.0,"I was very excited about this sweater. But as soon as I took it out of the package I was disappointed. The top wasn’t like a turtleneck, the fabric was a bit itchy. The complete look wasn’t worth it. I didn’t even take a picture of it, I returned it immediately!!!"
1.0,I text you about it being damage. The zipper was broken and I still haven't gotten any response. This also runs small in size. I am very unhappy with it. It was a gift for my daughter and she was very disappoint with it. The design is nice
1.0,"There are no instructions included, so I had to go on line to find them.  Also a glue is necessary for a permanent attachment, still looking for zap gel super glue.  Thus, the pads are not attached yet; hoping for the best."
1.0,bar for necklace was bent like a V
1.0,"Most of what I've gotten from Chicwe has been nice. Didn't care for this top though. Runs big and the fabric is weird and kind of shiny. Wouldn't have minded if it had been matte, but the shininess makes it look cheap."
1.0,Seller would not let me return these
1.0,"This top did not look anything like the photo when I got it.  Real short, too small and quality was poor."
1.0,"Material so thin it was like pajama weight. They get the cheapest material ever. Mine lasted one washing😡. Pima Cotten is what you should use, ask QVC to show you quality fabric"
1.0,They are all still so wrinkled I can't wear them and they are more spandex then cardigan.  I will never by anything from that brand again not as advertised.
1.0,They are so small I can barely get them on my ears and they don't stay closed. I've stopped wearing them as I just don't want to wear them.
1.0,The snap bracelets are awful. The plastic goes beyond the metal a good bit and most of them were wrinkled on the ends causing them to dig into the kids wrists. They just wrapped plastic around the metal and didn't seem to care that the seems on the plastic do not stick together very well. I am frustrated because I am too embarrassed to put these in my daughter's party bags so I feel like I just wasted money. The necklaces seem okay so far. I haven't taken the protective plastic off the actual pendant so I am not sure of the quality at this point. Very frustrated.
1.0,"The first time I put on this flimsy excuse for a compression jacket, the zipper unzipped, rendering it unuseable.  I donated it.  I rarely have a bad opinion about something I've ordered online.  You take your chances on fit and fabric and general desirability.  However, this was just a womans jacket marketed as unisex.  I just don't get how greedy some sellers are.  Seriously, if you're anything but a 5'2"" thin woman, this is not for you."
1.0,Not as pictured!! It was shorter on top than the sides! Had to go out and buy a new one! I expected it to be a cheaply made wig but didn't expect it to be dollar store quality.
1.0,I received this item and it had the worst smell. It smelled musty and like mildew. It also had this peculiar petroleum smell under it all.
1.0,"On the Amazon Prime special deal, it listed this shirt at an amazing sale price of $10.46. I am a solid Brooks fan, so I trust this too will be a great shirt. I clicked the picture and it took me to the shirt with the price at $26.46.<br /><br />Yes, I am a Prime member. No I don't like the feeling I was tricked."
1.0,Dress is not true to size. I order a x large which is a 12-14  If you wear a 12 you should order xxlarge and hope it fit. I am so sad because the dress is nice.
1.0,"Material very thin.  And sleeves were like for baby arms. It didn't come close to fitting.  Looked cheap, also."
1.0,Wow. I literally just got this shipment less than 5 minutes ago. Tried on the shirt and the strap literally popped off !! I’m so upset the shirt is so nice and stretchy but made poorly !!
1.0,BOTTOM OF PURSE STARTED TO PEEL AFTER A COUPLE OF WEARS!
1.0,I AM RETURNING THIS ITEM!!!! YOU CANNOT SEE ANYTHING WITH THESE GLASSES!!!!!
1.0,I washed the sweater one time and a pocket raveled off in the washing machine.
1.0,"Don't get me wrong the shoe looks awesome! BUT as soon as I pulled it out of the box, I noticed that it looked like a size 6 (it was 7 1/2). I tried it on anyway. I was right in noticing that it was small. It was a size, to a size and 1/2, too small. My foot hung off the back and it was extremely noticeable. AND the fit was very narrow. So if you order these, order bigger than normal size."
1.0,Really cute but I'm not even 5'5 they don't hit my knees. About 3-4 inches too short. I don't think it's good to have compression socks hit mid calf?  I'm glad I only purchased one pair! Will not buy again.
1.0,"Did not look like the picture, but I missed the return window so now I am stuck with it, it was also much larger than I expected."
1.0,It is disgusting I throw away my money the material is poor please don't buy it will shame u going out when it start ripped apart on u it's only a  face of fancy and disgrace need my money back I am  upset  u can contact me by my email andreawalker457@gmail.com I will tell u more
1.0,Item was too small. Having trouble getting refund. Contacted seller who said contact Amazon. Ridiculous
1.0,Very gaudy and ugly
1.0,Sooo big in size
1.0,Runs about 2 sizes small<br />Material is crappy
1.0,Very cheap & too small
1.0,"It is a serious misrepresentation to call these no-show socks. It shows around the entire shoe, with every dressy shoe."
1.0,This was too long and too tight that it made it hard to even walk comfortably. I’m 5’2” and 100 lbs. Size S came only a few inches above my ankles. The fabric is just OK - feels like the price is right at $17.  But it doesn’t have enough stretch that it was so hard to walk.  Returned it.
1.0,"So small, basically for a child"
1.0,Poor quality. Arrived very late
1.0,"I usually order medium(waist about 32"") so ordered US size 32 following the size chart given in the description. I received the product with US size 32 but actual waist size is 33-34"". Length is okay, waist is stretchable, quality is okay"
1.0,Brokr
1.0,There is NO WAY that these are sized for up to an adult size 12. My 12 year old daughter could not even get her foot through the ankle opening. Very disappointing. Will not be buying clothing on Amazon again as NOTHING in this order fit to the sizes ordered.
1.0,"I ordered this blazer in a L. First, it was supposed to be 95% cotton. It was not- it was tagged as polyester. It was so large i swam in it. I returned it."
1.0,Love the dress but stated size is about two times two small.
1.0,"Understands that at the moment of receiving it would have a nice gift, but it is ugly.Advise to anyone who wants to buy that not buy you, it's horrible, a hoax."
1.0,This has a long clasp on it which makes it really hard to use if you make the van smaller<br />I bought this for my wife and she ended up not using it because of the long clasp but makes it very difficult to use
1.0,"Just received this bag and the zipper is broken already!! It keeps splitting at the end so that it doesn't stay shut. Disappointed since I really like this design and size of the backpack. Not sure if I just got a defective bag, but definitely returning. Wish it could've worked out."
1.0,Posts are to thick they hurt my ears
1.0,"This review is for the person/company that shipped the product.  Not only did I get a shirt and not bottoms, it had dog hair all over it! Tag was ripped off as well. The shirt is nice however."
1.0,"Cheaply made, clasp broke the first week I had it!"
1.0,terrible quality would not stay in place and came on a hook !😡
1.0,This dress was extremely cheap. It smelled like fish when I received it in the mail so I had to wash it - the ends of the liner frayed. It’s certainly not as fluffy as the picture shows. Colors were accurate. Wouldn’t buy again.
1.0,"While the wings are pretty they do not send wings in so you can position like the picture , they are all one sided . Misleading picture, so can’t make project I envisioned."
1.0,I like but small and fake like out of light color picture
1.0,Nice bead but it arrived broken
1.0,Cheap garbage. 0 stars
1.0,"This did not fit my Apple Watch at all. One side was much too loose, the other side was too tight. I got the one for my specific watch but I think it was just poorly made. Would not recommend"
1.0,I only used the umbrella a few times and the handle fell apart and the spring popped out. I am unable to put it back together and it appears as though I cannot return it for a new one.
1.0,"I wanted these to work so bad. I love the idea of being able to wear a bra that keeps my girls separate and up?! The idea of having no band that squeezes?! Wonderful idea! However, I put them on. I sat down, and my girls slowly fell out the bottom. The circles are very sticky & suspect that ladies with smaller boobs will have no problem. However, my E size ladies are too much even for the E size cups."
1.0,I was rather disappointed because the dress came with the tag deliberately cut off and I cant tell whether or not I received the correct size.<br /><br />Its very tight and not true to size
1.0,It was very small didn’t go past my knees waste of money
1.0,Had to return because the waist area was tight and the upper are was not fitted.
1.0,"Absolutely not worth the money. Cheap latex or rubber material. Super small size, doesn't fit well. Mask does not keep its shape. Absolutely not worth its price. Now it's currently unavailable."
1.0,"This is not linen.  It is cotton.  The picture looks like the design is sewn on, not it is a vinyl iron on.  Very very disapponted."
1.0,I have a small waist and I ordered a small. The waist area fit was ok but there aren't any adjustable straps so my breast were popping out of the dress (I'm a 38C) also the bottom isn't that form fitting as I would have liked
1.0,"I'm a bigger girl and have bigger calves so I thought being able to tie these would help kinda fix that situation... The laces don't go all the way up, they are thin round laces that feel like they could snap at any given moment. The sole of the shoe itself is not comfortable at all. I get that most boots usually take a moment to break in, but nothing about this fit was comfortable. I may as well have stuck my foot in a plastic box. These were a bust for me - which sucks because they are super cute and would have gone so well with a few of my winter outfits!"
1.0,They were so pretty at first then in the matter of less than 1 day they broke
1.0,I am not pleased. I ordered this it is okay but whoever put it together put a woman side zipper on it. Like really you don't know what side of zipper is for a man?..
1.0,"Nice material.  Top too short, very frustrating"
1.0,"Also, they didn't fit all that well."
1.0,Although this hat is warm and comfortable the seams broke first time I put it on. Instead of sending it back I pulled out a needle and thread. Do not recommend.
1.0,Cheap material.  Fits small.
1.0,This did not fit my snake chain bracelet. I did not return it in time.
1.0,Total junk. It just falls apart with regular use. I tried a second one to see if it was any better but nope. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,I need an extra small. I am 5’6” and 120 lbs. I think I am a small but a small is too big.
1.0,Color was not what it was exspected
1.0,It's torn. Otherwise it would have been good
1.0,"Cheap, back clasp broke after only a few months and now I can't return it. Don't buy."
1.0,Too bulky like a briefcase
1.0,The print is just printed on the fabric. Looks very cheap. It was a gift so I kept it and wear it around the house. It is comfortable...just very cheap looking
1.0,WOW!!! Sooooooo havy and too big  face Covering part!<br />Don't protect uv sun for your face!!
1.0,It break easy and change colors have your arm green a bunch of bull
1.0,"Does not fit.  I ordered size 40 got 3XL. Way, way, bigger than 40.<br /><br />Not sure if the wrong item got put in my bag or if their sizing is off. I’d avoid taking any chances and don’t order these.<br /><br />The tag does say to wash with similar colors don’t bleed into it. Maybe if I wash this with some 36s these pants shrink."
1.0,Cheap jean material and HUGE
1.0,"All lies, didn’t fit didn’t work, save your money."
1.0,Top part was not sewn together
1.0,Fortunately Amazon has great customer service. I didn’t even need to return the watch for the refund. Not sure If it’s because they know how terrible the light is. I really like the size of the watch as I have very small wrists but unfortunately the light is useless. It does absolutely nothing to help see the time in the dark. I have another Casio coming that I hope is not too big. In the mean time I can use this but only during the day
1.0,"When I purchased these I was tricked into thinking they were &#34;one size all&#34;. When I received them, they were wrapped in a plastic bag with a sticker marked XL. When I opened the bag and looked at the leggings I laughed. They are HUGE. There also was no tag on the inside of them indicating what size they were and nothing on the receipt claiming the size. They also are very ugly in person and look like they were made from a cheap disposable table cloth. I didn't even bother returning them. I will never purchase anything from this seller again."
1.0,Like the product but the large fits like an x small.
1.0,"Don’t waist your money, it doesn’t work"
1.0,These mask were not what I expected.
1.0,This is more like a dress than a shirt.  I'm 5'4 and it goes to my knees.
1.0,Sadly the old adage &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; stands true.  The is jacket is only good for a costume party as the fabric is beyond flimsy and cheap. The style is cute but simply looks cheap.
1.0,"I like how cute they are, but they are not reliable for coninuous use. They snag on everything, fall out, some times they go all the way through my ear and cause an infection. You can't clean them because the acrylic can't be sterilized, and they come in one bag. They aren't separated by size."
1.0,Too large poorly designed
1.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered up a size.  I would have had to order up 3 sizes.  It was returned."
1.0,"The flags are lind if too big for a suit lapel and gaudy. Very dissappointed. My order included  defective flag, the stripes had fallen out of it creating a hole, I sent them all back."
1.0,Purchased as a gift for a senior person and she was not happy with quality.
1.0,If I could negative star this i would. VERY CHEAP SHOE  falling appart before even tried on. Threads hanging. Top if Velcro strap coming appart. Heel strap way to far forward so toes stick out on front. heel dosent come anywhere near the back of shoe. Just really badly made. And very wobbly no stability at all.
1.0,"Defective. Screw holes for handle did not align with the wheel base screw holes. Appears very cheap, would not recommend"
1.0,"Opened it, unzipped it, zipper fell in my hand."
1.0,Too small this is a slim fit
1.0,Cute necklace but clasp broke within five minutes of wearing beyond repair. I knew it wouldn’t last long as it was a cheap piece of jewelry but I would have been happy with even a couple uses out of it.
1.0,These are definitely not US measurements.
1.0,COULDN'T GET A PAIR THAT WERE MY PANTS SIZE UP PAST MY THIGHS
1.0,Super long. Hangs too far below earlobe. Doesn't run across the bottom as shown in pictures.
1.0,BROKE BEFORE I EVEN GOT IT ON.
1.0,"I did not like the hat; it did not seem the way it looks in pictures. My refund is  $12 short. I guess I am being charged for something. Never again, me thinks"
1.0,"It was a pretty color but looked huge, it's very wide would fit for maternity. I washed it  to shrink it and then it was a wrinkled fat shirt. The material is not good!"
1.0,"Never expanded to full size, purchased for my daughters birthday party and had to scrap the idea when it was party time. Gave them a week or more to open up."
1.0,"I guess I discovered that my daughter had a silicone allergy or maybe whatever material they're made from, after wearing these wristwatch bands she developed really bad skin irritation"
1.0,Product started to turn after a few wears! Cheap!
1.0,Very small material not what i thought. Color was good.
1.0,"Returned the item, Size was too large, Item quality was very poor"
1.0,Weak material had it a month and already teared at pockets.
1.0,This was not what I expected at all. I will wear it to sleep in because it’s more like a pajama top.
1.0,These where advertised as steel toe in the headline which they are not equipped with. False advertising with click bait. Other than that I haven't had them long enough to see how they will hold up. Can't use them at work now so I guess they'll just be used for riding. Nice fit though.
1.0,"I wear a size 10 shoe. While these socks fit comfortably after they are on, getting them on is the hard part. The legging part of the sock does not appear to be elasticized, so they don’t stretch to actually pull up over the foot too easily. I’ve never had a pair of socks made this way before.  I would not recommend these at all."
1.0,This is a beautiful necklace. I have ordered it a while  ago and lost it. So I decided to replace it. After 3 months the products stone became detached. Needless to say I’m so disappointed this time around.
1.0,This isn't stainless steel because in one week it’s brown
1.0,The leggings ripped 5 minutes after starting our workout.
1.0,"It’s pretty, but so magnetic. It’s hard to put on and untangle it."
1.0,Terrible stitching and back pocket was half way sewn through. Holes started ripping for no apparent reason. Returned.
1.0,Terrible. Basically a large tshirt.
1.0,These are very cute and great quality.  However they advertise as non-slip and withing a 1/2 hour they were slipping right off.  They are a very smooth material.  I have always had issues with headbands not staying on and I was hoping these would be different.  For quality I would recommend.  Maybe they will stay on for others but not me unfortunately.
1.0,"Looks nice and fits nice, but already has fallen apart.  Holes in both arms.  He wore the shirt once.  Pretty good price until you consider it's a one wear shirt...  disappointed is an understatement."
1.0,"This looks cheap, like a Halloween costume. Not at all like the picture or description. Will never purchase from this company again. So disappointed. Would give zero stars if possible."
1.0,"Despite wanting to believe this hat could truly keep my face in shade, this design truly fails on what it was made for.<br /><br />Instead of keeping your face cool with the mounted fan at front, what you get Instead is a heavy fan that causes the hat to tilt over time. Despite me attempting to keep the fan leveled,  the fan just is not strong enough to make a breeze for outdoor use."
1.0,"The bag literally had a tag that said &#34;defective&#34;. It absolutely lived up to that. The neckline looks unfinished, or it just has a hole in it,  and it is therefore completely unwearable!"
1.0,"I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas & ended up returning them because one of the seams on the leg was not properly sewn (the machine missed about a half inch of fabric, leaving a gaping hole in the seam).  Upon their return, we were sent a replacement pair which also had to be returned. My daughter tried to wash them for the first time so she could wear them & when she opened the washing machine found a long black thread intertwined with the rest of her laundry. It was discovered to be a thread from these leggings which had come unraveled from the seam up the center in the back. My daughter is 25 and very small (4'11"" & around 110 lbs), so the size SMALL should have been just fine. I believe if they improved on their quality control, these would be terrific leggings. She initially found them to be very comfortable, a nice material weight (not too thick, but thick enough to not be see through when bending over) & loved the side pocket. She was so disappointed."
1.0,It looks like it was painted with gold paint and is very gaudy looking. Not good for a woman at all. Way too big and cheap looking.
1.0,"I bought this item in good faith, but savvy enough to have this 14k white gold toe ring authenticated.<br /><br />To my disappointment the jeweler told me this toe ring was actually 14k yellow gold, that there was a coating on top of the yellow gold to make it appear as if it were white gold.<br /><br />Don't buy any jewelry from  JewelryWeb, they're unethical, if they can try to be sneaky about selling a product, what won't they do to commit fraud to make a sale?<br /><br />Amazon should remove this vendor as they false advertise about their products."
1.0,"It fell apart all day long. I spent so many frustrating minutes repairing it and reconnecting the clips to my stockings.  And,  the clips would fall apart while I was trying to get them attached.  Absolutely useless. Pretty though,  it's Pretty Useless and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT.<br />LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE."
1.0,"Cheaply made, Way too Small"
1.0,Way too small. Completely dissatisfied. If I could figure out how to return them I would.
1.0,"Worked well for my ten year old granddaughter, the ""bags"" are child sized and cheaply made."
1.0,The material is so cheap that it rusted on the first time that I washed my hands.
1.0,Very cheap. Only the silver earrings line up right and snap. They will come unsnapped and fall off your ears.
1.0,"I have no idea how this got any good reviews. This dress is so poorly made, it's like a Halloween costume. The material is like a thin sheer nightie."
1.0,I'm a medium-large. Ordered a medium and it fits like an extra large. Looked horrible. Order 2-3 sizes smaller!
1.0,This dress is not recommended for women with boobs- the opening is too wide .
1.0,"If you can imagine making a 'blazer' out of toilet paper then you can imagine what this will look like. The cut/shape is actually pretty nice, outside of running pretty small. But this thing is so thin! It's completely see thru. It's thinner than the polyester button up shirt I was wearing but had to take off to try this blazer on. And it was NOT JJ Perfection brand, it's another brand with no size tag in it anywhere. Would not buy again & this one is going back! FYI, shipping was almost $5 to ship TO me & another $4 to return it!!"
1.0,"Horrible quality, not shaped like a sock, seller would not allow refund though we immediately requested it, do not waste your hard earned money."
1.0,"I really, really wanted to like this. Black is my signature color and the design &#34;appeared&#34; promising. After this poncho was recommended by one of my favorite YouTube bloggers, I was happy to find it in stock at a not-so-local Walgreen's store. Now, hoping I've still got the receipt.<br /><br />The fabric on this product is inferior.<br /><br />After ONE wear, I laundered the poncho in a delicate cycle, cold water wash. It then dried on a flat drying screen. It was a huge disappointment to find that after laundering (according to directions), it is no longer wearable. The rayon fabric is extremely poor quality. After one delicate cycle wash, it has pills all over the garment. Next, I saw a small hole in the fabric on an area that shows through to the skin. In my experience, this product is cheap and a sure waste of money (and time laundering). The cost of 19.95 is a high-cost per wear as it is no longer presentable after one washing. If you decide to purchase, ensure that you save the receipt and have the option to return it if necessary."
1.0,Didn't fit my galaxy watch returned
1.0,"I would give them 0 stars if I could. The earrings were pretty, but what good does that do if the tiny stones start coming off after 1 use?"
1.0,Too short to be pants. They are long shorts at best! Unhappy and will be requesting a refund as soon as possible!
1.0,⚠️Over priced & not good quality.<br />Received broken.
1.0,"Cualquiera piensa que será al menos de tela, pero más bien parece cartón. No vale la pena."
1.0,I would give it no stars but I have to put something to review it. This item is not as it is advertised on here. Metal is sharp. It wasn’t buffed out. The stones are the wrong color. Waited for a month for this gift only for it to be trash. It was a Mother’s Day gift for my mother but being that it’s awful I will not be giving it to her.
1.0,These are the worst watch bands I’ve ever seen. They don’t work well at all. Almost lost my watch twice.
1.0,Low quality and took over a month to receive.
1.0,Really beautiful. Look expensive. But useless if thy are lying in a drawer because the clasps are all defective.
1.0,The rose gold coloring started to fade after 2 wears
1.0,"The material of this sweatsuit is very soft and comfortable, but every time I have washed and dried them; the lint trap was full of<br />Something that looked like black soot!"
1.0,"What a piece of cr*p glove. I know the price is low. But the picture is very misleading. The actual glove is very cheap compare to the picture one. For the one in the picture, I am willing to pay $30+ for it. Even though this glove is like $7, but I won't even want it for free. Seller need to correct the picture with the actual image of glove."
1.0,Runs way smaller that what they described I ordered an extra large and all it does it cut circulation 🙄 and squish my titties I’m sorry but I’ve order sports bras in medium and large and they fit properly but because of the reviews I red before purchase I decided to get an extra large and it’s still too small
1.0,Terribleeeeeeeeee desgusting
1.0,"Really a trash product. The onesie was big in some places and extremely tight across the chest and belly. The 0-3 onesie barely fit my 2 week old but the tutu, headband and leggings were way too large. Also, smells terrible like plastic or chemicals. Its in the garbage."
1.0,Shockingly poor quality compared to three pairs I bought at Marshall’s about 6 yrs ago.<br />No support. Should have returned them.
1.0,"Dress was not what I expected at all. To big , and had 0 structure. The color was true to the photo, but the lace was somewhat cheap feeling.<br />When returning the dress they claimed they would refund the shipping it took to return the dress and they did not do so.<br />Would not order again or recommend"
1.0,"The actual hat does not match the picture and description used when I purchased this hat. It is supposed to just say &#34;USMC,&#34; but the actual hat says &#34;USMC Veteran&#34; on it and I was buying for my nephew that is currently a marine. Returning as we speak."
1.0,When I got it it's was broken very cheap
1.0,"The glasses broke immediately upon unfolding for wear.  Unfortunately, the return window has passed."
1.0,"Runs very small, I'm large busted and wear a xl, got a 2xl and it fits like a large.  Looks very roomy and flowing in the pictures but it's not how it actually fits and its somewhat See through."
1.0,The structor of this item is very poor
1.0,looked damaged / tampered with and very cheap design
1.0,"Had intended this as a gift for future daughter in law's birthday. Looked good on the app but when it arrived I found it was incredibly small, no, tiny. It's going back without any regrets, except that I've wasted my time buying it. If you're looking for something nice, keep looking because this isn't it."
1.0,"Was very very childish and cheap looking. Granted the price was awesome, but not at all as elegant as the picture looks."
1.0,"Material of dress looks nothing like the picture. The part that goes around your arms, chest and back. Is like a scrunchie."
1.0,It has synthetic. I'm allergic to synthetic and my skin reacted to it. Plus rayon doesn't shine only synthetic does. I always but rayon or cotton because that's all I can wear. Waste of money
1.0,"This did not have a swivel alligator clip like the description. If you’re looking for a swivel alligator clip, look elsewhere!"
1.0,Size was not the problem the button holes where not there. And the hooks came in a bag. I was very disappointed with this order.
1.0,Won't even turn on. First one we ordered a replacement for. 2nd one won't turn on either. Battery looks puffy.
1.0,It’s essentially a paperweight. Bought it for a Halloween costume for my 8yo son based on it stating cosplay in the description. The whole thing is literally the size of his hand. For the money this should have been advertised better. Buyer beware!
1.0,"As headline says, just popped out while walking (glasses were hanging on shirt collar indoors), lost the lens. Plastic frame is completely in tact. I asked a question here on Amazon for warranty/help from vendor with zero response."
1.0,I’m shocked that anyone would actually want to keep this dress as the seam is oddly placed right down the center of it - in front. And the polkadots of course do not lineup because it’s so cheap. Sending back.
1.0,"Be aware that these gloves are shipped from China, and sized accordingly.  I bought a large pair of gloves and am trying to find a young girl that will enjoy them.  They appear to be nice gloves... for a child."
1.0,"I used this a bag on one trip and it is ripping at a seam. For the one use I got out of it, I liked it, but I can't recommend a bag that has such poor quality."
1.0,Won’t stay on the backpack straps easily slides off
1.0,Very cheap looking product. The quality and color are not good. Stitches are terrible. Wasting money
1.0,don't waster your time if your a side M or larger. Very cheap and does not apply US sizing accurately
1.0,"Fits right, but came already snagged & full of static - really kinda ugly"
1.0,Broke immediately<br />Disappointed
1.0,Fabric is thin and of poor quality.  I've been buying this style direct from Lands end for years -  this  shirt (and the other three I bought through Amazon) have to be  Lands End rejects.  So disappointed!
1.0,"I re-ordered this product and it was no longer the same.  It used to be a relaxed fit, now I could barely get my arms in and the sleeves were shorter.  I am 5""2 and 110 pounds and ordered the small."
1.0,The picture looks different from the actual item.  More cat eye
1.0,My ball fell off
1.0,Very thin and almost see through
1.0,There so small in circumference like for children.  They are very pretty.
1.0,Very uncomfortable the 9 was tight. Very surprised
1.0,"very thin and cheaply made , not for a wood stove"
1.0,Came with battery that didn’t even work from day 1. Wouldn’t buy again
1.0,Nice mask but a RIP off.  1 mask with 10 cheap inserts for $20.
1.0,Very pretty but haven't had for a week and already lost two small stones
1.0,"I wanted to like this top, it would have been a cute summer top. But it fit me in an awkward way and fabric bunched up around my rib cage. Had to return for refund."
1.0,"Really, Nike?! The built-in-bra is an epic fail. It does not offer enough support on it's own and there's no way you could fit another bra comfortably underneath it.<br />I am a huge Nike fan, but this product is just terrible. It looks weird, it feels weird. Big no no. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Very tiny  looks cheaply made
1.0,They didn’t even fit well
1.0,Didn’t fit and very cheaply made.  Not worth the money.
1.0,Broke as soon as I tried to put one on. But I was able to send back for refund
1.0,"We ordered these as a Christmas present, so they just got opened. 2 of the 4 were kinda cute. The shark and monster(?... we thought it was stitch at one point) were basically just blobs."
1.0,Broke after 20 days
1.0,Feather put indents in my ear and hurt to lay on it.
1.0,"The shirt arrived within 48 hours with prime, however I was so disappointed. The material is rayon/polyester versus cotton and looks like it will melt if you attempt to iron it. Also, the holes have no rhyme or reason and look like someone ways rushing to get the shirt off the press and to the customer so they cut random gignormous holes in different places. There is a gaping hole in the abs section and other unforgiving holes throughout the shirt but not resembling the advertised photo. This a very amateur attempt at making a distressed top as I could've made a better one on my own. I am returning it."
1.0,I don't like it because I look like a man other than a  woman.
1.0,Don't waste your money! It broke after I wore it for less than 24 hours!
1.0,Its to much big for my arms :(
1.0,His face looked weird. The lower half of the face looked weird as if the paint ran into each other.
1.0,Stitching on emblem was way off. Was a Father's Day gift for my army vet husband. Was super disappointed as I watched him open this.
1.0,"The fabric was pretty cheap, the dress didn’t fit as intended. It was tight in some areas and lose in others .<br />I wear a size 4 pant, s/m tops 34c bra. Active built"
1.0,Material was terrible and thin and just felt cheap overall. Runs VERY small. Returned it immediately.
1.0,"I'm a size 18 and have pretty small legs for my size, but even the XL wouldn't fit me. I was really disappointed because the feet are really cushioned."
1.0,Broke when I was trying it on
1.0,Smells really bad like old glue- still hasn't gone away after months
1.0,"Hahaha, oh boy...<br />This one was awful, gotta say. While I know there aren't a whole lot of chokers that fit my tiny neck, this one went straight to the trash.<br />I guess that's what you expect for buying a 2 dollar 'collar', lol<br />It smelled really weird, too. Not pleasant. And as many others have said already, the heart shape was really bad, too. This is definitely a knock-off.<br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,Uncomfortable. Straps around the ears are small. It’s a tight fit around the face. Not good for working out.
1.0,"Unfortunately I can’t use these because they squish against my face. There is no structure to the fabric to help it hold its shape, so when I talk the plastic sticks to my face - it’s a lot like squishing your face against a window. I was optimistic that this would work, but it doesn’t for me."
1.0,I have tried over and over again and it will not pair with the motor. Followed the instructions and even followed other ideas available on-line. They do not work!!
1.0,seams are sideways no one could wear it
1.0,"Earrings were bent when received, not worth time to send back."
1.0,It said kids hat and it appeared for adults
1.0,It's big. Like huge on me. I'm 5foot and 113lbs. Buy smaller if you buy this
1.0,"Honestly not worth the price, the necklaces are big not really ""chokers"" ... the clasp is very hard to open and I wouldn't recommend.. they're beautiful but I couldn't even wear them."
1.0,Cheaply made (both fabric and craftsmanship) and not nearly as cute as in the picture.  Returning it
1.0,Small arm strap and small strap to hold mat. My think mat did not fit into this sling.
1.0,Loved it until it tarnished on me within a week. Cut it in half to make it more cute but still looked bad.
1.0,Very cheap material and the mesh areas looked strange in person.
1.0,Watchband broke
1.0,Zipper broke after only a few uses!!!
1.0,"This dress looks pretty until you put it on. It seems to be several sizes. I gave it to someone (gave it because I knew I’d never wear it) for a wedding and they had the same issue, that it didn’t fit anywhere. They underneath dress and the overdress have different necklines so you’re constantly adjusting it, and don’t think about having your picture made in it. Not worth the price, find something else."
1.0,Not true to size very small for a Xxl couldn’t even zip it up I returned it although it was quality materials
1.0,Horrible ring. Nothing like the picture. Very cheap look. The stone is pure plastic and the metal looks so fake. Complete disappointment.
1.0,The robe arrived missing the sash to tie it.<br />Everything else is fine.<br />I didn't really expect much more for the price.
1.0,Lawd ! This was super tight it would even go over my damn head and my heads not even big smh
1.0,"The dress sizing was pretty good.  A bit snug around my chest, but not a dealbreaker.  The material and stitching were both poor quality.  It was a silky fabric that was very cheap looking.  I’ll be returning this."
1.0,I cannot wear the watch because the strap mechanism does not stay shut. I tried following the instructions. I even took it to a watchmaker. No luck.
1.0,I wear a usual 12/14. i have wide hips and butt.  Ordered 2xl and jacket  wouldn’t zip up and pants were so tight that if I moved they would’ve split.  Not true to size at all!!!! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,It snapped in half after a week of wearing it
1.0,I cant send it back either 😡😡😡🤮
1.0,"I was so excited to use this since I get my card stuck in the machine at the gas station all the time because of my nails. When I tried to use it, the card wouldn't come out then I took the rubber part off to see if that would help and the head snapped off. I'm so annoyed."
1.0,Not nearly as good as I had hoped.
1.0,Bodice cuts across the breast.  Too low cut.
1.0,The purse was very plasticy. Not at all what I expected. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap - it broke as I was trying to pull a scarf through it
1.0,Very disappointed in this purchase I wouldn't recommend it at all.Very poor quality fabric and it looks cheap even though I didn't pay alot I expected more.
1.0,Looks NOTHING like pic for product. Looks like something you'd get in a dollar store. Chrome plated cheap pot metal... probably turn finger green. Save your money!
1.0,"Well, the belt isn't bad, it fits right, but the buckle is made of soft metal. It broke after about 8 uses as I was putting it on. The roller part just snapped off. Belt is unusable."
1.0,Very cheaply made the Vail came apart on its own mine is a xxxl and I can swim in it seance there was no size when I order it i was unsure of what I was getting the zippers are plastic but work ok I would suggest to spend the extra money on a better suit that will fit and not come apart
1.0,"I am very skinny. I normally wear a small. I got a medium because reviewers said they run small.  WAY TOO TIGHT, and not at all flattering. I hope I can return them! I have a cute little bubble butt, and the pants turn it into a flat mom butt."
1.0,"This item was described as maternity overalls. If you’re pregnant don’t order them, they come a month later and end up being regular overalls I could’ve bought at a nearby store.<br />One size up on overalls is not helpful considering that they run small."
1.0,"it's a waist of money , it is two small plastic strips...."
1.0,Too thin Cheaply made
1.0,"It smells really bad,Even after wash it twice."
1.0,Fugly!  I returned them.
1.0,"sooo not what was expected!! Literally looks like a night gown my elderly grandmother would wear, hangs off the body, not flattering at all, will be returning for refund."
1.0,So cute! But they slide off my glasses very easily because the part you tighten constantly stretches out. Keep looking!
1.0,Terrible dress. Material was thinner than a cotton T-shirt
1.0,Poor quality white mask that was painted black. Showed up chipped.
1.0,Item arrived with a broken mirror. Needed to do a return.
1.0,Will have to return this as color is not right. Will not opened the item or try as there no point.
1.0,"Update - I bought two over the last 6-13 months. They are very comfortable and help block the suns harmful rays, but I am now EXTREMELY dissatisfied … the collar buttons side of the shirt neck came apart on both shirts, in the exact same area. Workmanship and quality control is crap; I had to throw them away. Do t buy!"
1.0,These ears come “lightly“ assembled. I’ll have to glue the ears back onto the headband myself because a strong breeze would take these away.
1.0,Very disappointed  should be sent a hat that is made right. I mean what the heck. Half the squirrel is cut off. Really have some pride in your work. I mean obviously yall are just clearly trying to make money off of people but dang yall down right be embarrased for shipping something like this to someone. Terrible looks nothing like what yall have advertised. Ya it's the same pic but it's not on the hat right. I want the hat like you have advertised. The squirrel centered on the hat showing all of him. Not like the crap you had the  nerve to send me w his face half cut off. You should be ashamed
1.0,To small needed a 14g
1.0,"Got white ""butterfly"" as a gift for a friend.. Pros:<br />-vague representation of the design you order<br />-has a string to tie around neck<br />-not overly thick or saturated<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Different than advertised<br />-One sided<br />-VERY VERY VERY (and I can't stress this enough) V E R Y thin.<br />-only a string to tie around neck (low low quality)<br />-cheaply made (very overpriced this would be much more appropriate at about $5-$10 NOT $17)<br />-seams all around and folds EVERYWHERE (and the material is too cheap to iron out)<br />-very low resolution design (design overlaps itself like when you look through those cardboard 3D glasses)"
1.0,The pants look cheap. Not true to size. Also the website description showed a totally different looking pant.
1.0,"Ladies, I've had an outdoor wedding and put great hopes on these (rather expensive) protectors to make sure I wouldn't destroy my DvF shoes. One word to sum up my experience with those: terrible. (1) They look ridiculous on your heels. If you think they're transparent, don't. They're still quite visible and destroy the look of your gorgeous shoes. I had to remove them as soon as I changed from my floor-long gown into a shorter dress for the cocktail part. (2) These seriously haven't had ANY effect on the level of my comfort / balance on cobble stones around the venue. I still had to grab my hb's arm - or anyone else's who happened to be around - to simply walk. The circle around the stiletto heel was completely useless for support as it turned from a flat round surface into some kind of funnel-like dirty heel tip. (3) Despite me ordering the right size according to manufacturer's measurements, this protector was really hard to put on - and equally hard to remove. So i had to walk around like this despite my strong desire to get rid of those ridiculous plastic pieces."
1.0,"The description says the watch case measures 49.2mm....It does not. I compared it to watches I have that are 50mm. This watch is much smaller. It connected to my cell phone ok, but it's kind of cumbersome to use for me. I'll be retuning it."
1.0,"Not even worth the 1 star!!!  I purchased the Antica Murrina Veneziana Cancun Necklace, Bracelet & Earrings as a Christmas surprise for my sister on NOVEMBER 28th.  I received a ""your order has been shipped"" email on NOVEMBER 30th with a tracking numbering.  It is now DECEMBER 18th, and I still do not have my purchase!!!  When I view UPS to track, it has been stuck in the UPS warehouse since DECEMBER 1st.  I have called UPS over a half-dozen times and each person gives me a different answer as to why it's being held in customs.  I finally got tired of doing the leg work and emailed FORZIERI (the jewelry vendor) 3 times to see if they had better luck.  Someone finally emailed me back on DECEMBER 16th saying they would look into why it's being held.  I have not received anything further from them.  At this point I am extremely frustrated and disappointed.  This was supposed to be a fun Christmas surprise for my sister who had this jewelry on her wishlist.  I can't believe the time I'm spending just to get this package."
1.0,Drawstring outside is totally wrong!
1.0,Straps are waaaay too short. Lace was at my neck
1.0,"Wish I could give ZERO stars! Wish I hadn't ordered. Didn't fit, looked awful, just DONT!  Shipping and customer service were awesome, I would use this seller again, but the actual mask, horrible. Ended up just tossing it, not even worth the cost of returning."
1.0,"I am SO disappointed in the quality of these glasses. I’ve ordered $8 glasses that looked better. I received these the day before my birthday so I waited to open them the morning of, and much to my surprise they were trash. Not only were the polarization scratched on the surface but internally there was a weird black scuff that looks like it was a quality issue in manufacturing. I don’t even want another pair. These heart shaped glasses left me heart BROKEN!"
1.0,The product received was not the prouduct pictured. I received Halloween makeup sealant which is useless for every day use.
1.0,The fit was fine but they are so thin and cheap. They feel like microfiber underwear.
1.0,Smashed in package
1.0,This was supposed to be a replacement band... after having to wait approximately two weeks for the item.  When I do receive it... it attach's easily enough... uh oh... to easy.  IT WON'T STAY ON!! One side or the other slips pulls off no matter how tight or loose it is.  I tried to wear it on the first day and it would not stay on for longer than a few minutes before it would detach itself. This was an absolute waste of money.
1.0,Low quality product!
1.0,The sizing of this is completely off. I ordered a medium and need an canal at this rate
1.0,"The dress came in November. I bought it as a Christmas gifts for my daughter. Imwhen she opened it up and tried it on, she discovered the shoulder seam had come undone (see pic). I  contacting the seller now."
1.0,Very cheaply made.You can see right through it and just so poorly made
1.0,"The ring I got looks nothing like the ring pictured. The ring I got had a crease in the top of the circle that looks like a cut, the definition on the wolf's head was TERRIBLE. The wolf looked TOOTHLESS. And the lines were just blurry looking. The ""gems"" around the edge aren't really gems at all just bumps. It looks like they took a picture of a really nice ring and just sent out bad copies. Will be sending back. So disappointing."
1.0,Very cheap looking.  Like from a quarter trinket machine.
1.0,"Very cheap, 2 of the 3 broke within days is being changed out with original band."
1.0,This T-shirt fits like it’s a medium not an XL. Plus it’s so thin it’d never stand a single run through the washing machine.
1.0,"This dress was disappointing in every way.  The blush pink color is much less vibrant than in the picture - almost looks dirty.  You can't see it because the model has long hair, but the top of the dress is connected with a strange gold spirally thing that hooks like a necklace but falls completely out once you put the dress on.  So, you have to have someone help you thread it back through.  And, it fits like a TIGHT choker necklace, and I do not have a large neck.  I am 5' 8&#34; tall, and the large was so long it dragged on the floor.  I'd have to have it hemmed at least 4&#34; to wear it, but given the disappointing color and crazy way you have to put it on, I am sending it back."
1.0,"Very disappointed, just I put the dress on it tear."
1.0,Lovely wacht but came broken.
1.0,It had a blue stain on it
1.0,Not  only was just too small but the  size tag was removed.  I believe this was done on purpose and I don't appreciate it.  The size had to be at least six sizes too small.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed with these socks, they ripped from the side on the first wear."
1.0,Not true to fit
1.0,"Bust of the dress was too small. Everywhere else fit true to size. Unfortunately, seams ripped around the bust on first wear. Seams also ripped in the laundry. Not worth it."
1.0,The worst product I've ever purchased.  They look nothing like the picture. Looks like a child put it together . awful
1.0,"I got a large, i'm 120 pounds, still doesn't fit. Also it's super cheap feeling."
1.0,Waists of money too!
1.0,"If you are a US 3X or even XL, these shirts probably won't fit you at all. Also the fabric and look from the photo is very misleading from what you actually get. I'll be returning these. The clear wrapping you recieve the shirt in says XL on the inside, but the tag on the shirt says 3XL."
1.0,The link that the chain hooks to broke off within a week of wearing it.
1.0,Looks like im returning this said 5xl couldnt even get it to zip up
1.0,Disappointed. The scope piece was broken off and the whole gun was pretty dirty.
1.0,Do no listen to the other reviewers about this coat running sall. I sized up and so it is humongous. Unfortunately I have been out of the country and so now the return window is closed. I am stuck with a coat that is way too big.<br />Order true to size!
1.0,Did not fit as expected and it felt and looked cheap. I returned it.
1.0,"Hat started unraveling at the top seams after wearing it the first time. Very poor quality, do not recommend."
1.0,Love the look of this watch but after just a few weeks the clasp wouldn’t stay closed.  Unfortunately there is no way to tighten the clasp so it’s not a good buy
1.0,Had a terrible odor when I opened the packaging. Washed in cold water and tumble dried on air. Shrank.... now too small.
1.0,Each glove is balled up.  It makes no sense. You have to straighten out each finger to pull them on. I purchased for my business and I will not be buying again.
1.0,Sizing was not even close
1.0,"So I ordered this for my EIGHT year old.<br />It’s a crop top. No, no, no!"
1.0,Se mira la tela muy barata.
1.0,Way to small I wanted it for my ankle not for my hand.
1.0,"This is a large on me. It looks horrible. I’m 5’3”, 125lbs, athletic build, 34 C at VS. The bottom is a RAW EDGE, looks like it was thrown together. such poor quality."
1.0,"I guess I should’nt have expected this wallet to be very durable considering the price point, but I was hoping it would last longer than two and a half months. It is already peeling off in the corners and on the top after only 10 weeks of use 😢 Would not recommend. Do not buy!"
1.0,"Horrible, started falling apart at the seams after the first wash..."
1.0,Nice but took forever to get. Came from Overseas.
1.0,"Super comfy, but a little shorter than I expected.  Normally I unfold the cuffs to get a little more length, but these folds are sewn in place.<br /><br />After 2.5 months, the cuffs have stretched out and flare out in a very unattractive way.  I can't iron them flat because the fabric is totally stretched.  I'm bummed."
1.0,"I returned this because it is completely see thru, like the worst see thru white shirt i've ever tried on. I bought it in black also and love love love the black one! I returned the white and got maroon and grey, because of this i'm still rating a 5 because I love the others that aren't see thru, those are PERFECT! I'm 5 foot 7, 147 lbs athletic, 32DDD and got a small."
1.0,The beanie itself is almost toddler sized. Like what the heck? I couldn’t even get it on? So I can’t judge if the sound is good/battery life/ or anything.
1.0,"Why is this shirt displayed as if the sleeve and the body is tapered, the sleeve and the body looks nothing like the shirt in person."
1.0,Did not fit like a 2xl
1.0,"It worked for 2 months, and then stopped. It was kept in a charger whenever it was not being worn. It did not get submerged in water or banged up at all. It just stopped."
1.0,"Received a damaged jacket.  Jacket had bunch of holes, seemed to be puncher holes, and not usable as a rain coat : (  Very disappointed..."
1.0,could not slide one side into watch.  Unusable.  Should have returned it.
1.0,"There seems to be a fundamental flaw in the design of these &#34;hip hop teeth&#34; which I didn't notice when I ordered them.  If  you look at the second picture from the top of the Amazon site for this item, the teeth are facing the wrong way.  The way it is designed with the &#34;grillz and the holding bar&#34; on the back of these teeth, in placing them in your mouth you would have both the top and bottom set of teeth facing in the wrong direction. Instead of the teeth coming down from the top and going up from the bottom, they are in exact opposite, even if you reverse the top and bottom set of teeth. I have not melted the holding bar and tried them on yet, but you can see from the picture at the Amazon site and when you look at them in person that the teeth are presented backwards.  I was going to use these for Halloween, but I will have to see how they look while in place first."
1.0,These look really stylish on the model in the picture but they are not good. They are thick and terrible in person.
1.0,"Update- it’s cheaply made and started falling apart after several washings. Also, some of the dark blue dye bled into other areas of the dress and now it’s ruined."
1.0,Had to return because the stripes don't match up from front to back. Like its really bad and looks really weird.
1.0,"Looks good, BUT I used it on one short gig, and the holes for the buttons frayed and tore. It appears to be synthetic material and not leather. Not good on my $7k Gibson.  Also comes off easily for the small Gibson strap buttons...lucky I caught my guitar. I tried Schallers straplocks... it compressed the strap like foam."
1.0,i don't like the way they fit - going back today!
1.0,"Nice from a distance, but when you get to take a real look at it, just looks very...cheap."
1.0,"These boots are a joke.  They didn't even come in a box, so how do I send them back??  I shouldn't even  have to.. they should be thrown away"
1.0,"I ordered what should be my daughter's size originally and they were too small so I exchanged them, no big deal. Now my daughter has worn them less than 10 times and the tongue fell out."
1.0,"These two pairs of pants fit my child totally differently. One looks like it's too long in the crotch and the other one fits great! She won't let me return the whole set because she loves the ones that fit, but I'm very unhappy with this product."
1.0,"Not long like the pic, it’s boxy (very wide)."
1.0,"not very warm, runs small"
1.0,"I only have had the bracelet since March 7th, and it just broke right where the clasp hooks onto the small little circle, pretty disappointed, I really did like it, will be calling Amazon customer service for a refund"
1.0,Not as pictured! Read the other reviews!
1.0,"I ordered the navy and the dress I got was a significantly lighter color. The material was itchy and poorly stitched. I don't expect this dress will survive the first wash.  The material is also clingy. I ordered a medium when I normally order a small, but now I wish I had gotten a large. The sleeves and dress were also way to short on me."
1.0,"This hat is trash! Does not fit the forehead correctly. There's a piece of material that should have been cut out but wasn't. Seems like something that went array on an assembly line, was intended to be trashed but someone confiscated it and sold it online. This is NOT what you want! This is unfortunate because the fabric pattern is hella dope."
1.0,Small in the toes arch support was not that good overpriced.refund
1.0,I like the polka dots however they run really small. Panties cut into my thighs and hit just above my butt. Design is not good. I do not recommend
1.0,Product is terrible. Unwearable. Will tell everyone I know. Vacuum so tight that it was hard to get open. Surprised I didn’t cut it.<br />Terrible terrible business.
1.0,It must be a child's xl will never wear it
1.0,The necklace was broken when I receive it
1.0,"My daughter got water in it washing her hands, and the watch got waterlogged and didn't work."
1.0,ZERO IS MY RATING1<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br />IT MUST BE TIED ON -  DO NOT BUY  IT -  IT CAN NOT BE RETURNED - EVEN FOR PRIME MEMBERS !
1.0,Too small. These are made for very small woman's feet. Maybe even a childs.
1.0,"Needed this for a theme day at church, however very poor quality and very small. Shrank so much when washed. Terrible item!!"
1.0,the chain broke as soon as I put it on and the hook is broken
1.0,The dress seems nice when I tried on I haven’t worn it anywhere yet but I did order a large I usually wear a medium and glad I did. Update: I went to iron it and there was a big faded spot on the back so I will b returning it
1.0,"These are the most oddly made pants that I have ever bought.  The legs are too long and too narrow, the crotch is too short and too wide, the material is not at all stretchy - seriously, just don't buy them, save your self the aggravation and disappointment!"
1.0,"Not actually engraved, the writing is printed on and will wear off, disappointing!"
1.0,I bought the hat for an event. It came folded in a plastic bag. I tried for days to get the creases out to no avail. Very disappointed.
1.0,It's huge and doesn't look like the picture. The color is different and the fabric is really weird. Returning it!
1.0,The gold on the outside started peeling off with in hours of taking it out of the package
1.0,"Took it to my jeweler to have fitted, but CAN'T because only a limited number of fitting pins!!  Now I'm STUCK with it!!  GRRRR"
1.0,Not what I expected its a little too feeble
1.0,ugly - so cheap!!!
1.0,it doesn't offer any more compression than a normal undershirt would.
1.0,"Jacket sized very small and pants sized very large. I ordered an Extra large and the pants literally fall off and the Jacket was made for an extremely small person. The arms are so tight, you cant even get it on.  I normally wear a 14."
1.0,Don’t like the way it fastens.
1.0,"Inexpensive, but too cheaply made.<br />Both lens are loose.<br />Frame speaks when opening & closing ear pieces.<br />Not even going to &#34;test wear&#34; due to fear they'll break.<br />IMO, not worth the $20 price."
1.0,"Odd fitting, def wasn’t oversized like in the picture. Was a blended material, not like a sweater or sweatshirt. Wasn’t for me I had to return it"
1.0,"We ordered this particular Hunger Games Mocking Jay pin  because in the picture it clearly appeared to have a pin running alongside the full back of it with an attached clasp.  When the pin arrived, though, it did not have this.  Instead, it had only a short stump that goes through clothing with a detached clasp.  We wrote to the seller asking for this to be rectified and did not hear back.  We are very frustrated at this point."
1.0,"one hiking trip, one camping/backpacking trip and the soles are already tearing off. I've had sneakers hold up better."
1.0,"Its a good dress.. fabric feels like tshirt and more to the body than a flowy one. overall it is a good one but not flowy as the tittle say.<br />M fits for 5'4"" 160lbs<br /><br />Material is not great… worn off after few washes"
1.0,This item was see through material. It is not a proper dress. It is tiny and small and see through like lingerie. This is not a dress. I want a refund.
1.0,"Extremely flimsy plastic, all black without any color whatsoever."
1.0,"Cute, look like sanuk yoga mat flip flops kinda. The strap was a bit loose. These are cheap, no better than Walmart quality. Returned."
1.0,Lasted about a month before the opal started to peel off leaving the edges sharp causing it to cut my nose
1.0,Broke first time I used it. One of the tassels completely fell off.
1.0,logo peeled right off on day one.
1.0,So I purchased these earrings for my 4 year old. I then showed the pic to a friend and she loved them so I ordered a second pair. I received the 1st pair months after ordering (takes time from China- I get it). The clasp was broken and easily slipped out if the hole; basically garbage. I contacted the seller and took forever to get a refund but eventually did for the first pair. I tried to cancel the second pair but they conveniently shipped them the day I tried to cancel. Now in a tug of war with them bc they claim they already refunded me. Dont waste your time.1
1.0,"Bought my first pair at Nordstrom (style 493) and they were perfect and plenty long.....tried to buy two more pairs on Amazon and received style 593 and they were super short. Great, comfy pants but wish they were longer. At least returns are easy."
1.0,I have never seen such a narrow shoe.  I am a size 10 with average feet that might even lean a bit narrow.  A good 1/3in of my foot hung off the side and my toes hung off the end.  I even showed the shoes to a friend and my partner and their response was that the shoe even looked strange because it was so narrow.  SUPER disappointed.  Love the style and they seemed like they would be comfortable.  Cant seem to find any other shoes with a similar style.  SO SAD!
1.0,"5 stars for sheerness, because it was 100% sheer. Completely see-through. Don’t believe the stock photos of this item- it is not “hot pink” and it definitely provides no coverage at all. It is only like 2 layers of tulle, so the color is very washed out. This would only function as a crinoline layer to poof out a skirt. It is NOT a tutu to be worn alone."
1.0,Plus size ughhh no think again.... these were so freaking small really pissed me off because they were so cute like if I could have gotten them up pass my hips it would of been a beautiful thing!!
1.0,"Only comes with one earring, so weird"
1.0,Material is cheap and feels so light...bad choice for the price...will not recommend
1.0,The jacket seems to be worn before as I found white hair on that!!!!. the brand name patch area 's white thread can be seen on the other side and perforated the jacket in a place near it.  planning to return it.
1.0,The card was not in the box and so the person I gifted this to didn’t even know it was from me.<br />Very disappointing!!!
1.0,The color came off and stained fabrics
1.0,"Love all the interchangeable lenses, case is nice, but the frames are cheap. Wore them twice before the nose piece broke. Useless. Would not recommend these to anyone. One of the worst purchases I've made on Amazon. Highly disappointing!"
1.0,The quality is nice but they are just way too big.
1.0,cannot even wear it
1.0,"Didn't fit my iron at leather sleeves, and leather tore apart where belt attached"
1.0,Horrible it turn the next day 😪 and left a rash on my skin 😫 wld not but back
1.0,Stupid & don’t do anything. Not made for girls with actual breast. Go with Reg strapless. I am a 34C didn’t hold them up at all
1.0,There were only two in the package which was supposed to have 6
1.0,"The watch is beautiful and sparkly, but it doesn't work! We took it to a watch shop and bought a new battery. Still didn't work. Took it back to watch shop, they said the gears are plastic and cheap. GARBAGE."
1.0,Glasses are horrible. I do not like the lenses as they are so dark. The polarization on the glasses is poor. I would return but the case was torn.
1.0,Feels Cheap - bar is more like a metal tube.
1.0,Too small! Not sized for Americans
1.0,Too small terrible
1.0,This product left a residue on a new Stetson hat. The color is not changed but the product is inferior
1.0,Didnt look same as advertised..wont buy again...
1.0,Just ordered these used on a few nights woke up and it was ripped at the seem.
1.0,"Pretty but, way too large...."
1.0,The Listing lied it's pizza not papers. The animation picture on the hat is the size of a 50 cent piece. The picture makes it look like it's half the front and it's not. Very small. Kid was very dissapointed. I was given a 3$ refund for something I paI'd more then 7$. So a lost on that also. You want a good flash hat don't buy any from this seller. There not even stiche'd just a basic cloth sticker. As soon as I get home I will post a picture of the hat. It look like a ugly plain hat I could buy from China for 50 cents. Kid was very dissapointed.
1.0,"Its NOT a onion goggles !! After wearing it, there was SO much room Open on both sides ! not even little a lot of room for air to go in, seriously?? BAD design. Not just that the 2 little things were missing as shown in the pic, we didnt receive those.<br />Of course Returned."
1.0,I should of known better. Not even the color I ordered. I'm disappointed. Never again ordering clothes online. It has never worked out.
1.0,To small didn’t fit
1.0,I don’t work for Apa Johns. I work for Papa Johns. I pay 20 for this not even to come right in the mail. I won’t even attempt to wear it anywhere.
1.0,"The size of the glasses is for a young child, anyone pass 15 years of age will look ridiculous with this as they're so small."
1.0,"The zipper broke after the second washing.  The fabric is of poor quality, it already looks worn after only wearing it a few times and after the third time washing it.  I did like the color but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,This was a great product. I has them for almost for one year and already they are broken. Now I'm stuck searching for a new pair.
1.0,Looks pretty at first... Few weeks later the &#34;Gold Plated&#34; just faded away.. Its like cheap paint. Not even plated... Underneath the chain is stainless steel and the balls are brass.
1.0,Shoe ripped from the sole after only wearing for not even one month.
1.0,Item arrived with color bleaching spots  on the top.
1.0,The post on one set has broke off. Not very happy.
1.0,Fits way to small and the patches look cheap.
1.0,"I bought these as gifts and within a day, my friend told me it had broken on the clasp. The other one I bought’s clasp was also falling apart."
1.0,Cheap quality very disappointed. my son saved to buy this wallet he's 11 years old and he was very excited to purchase this item unfortunately a week after he started using it ripped .
1.0,I kinda hate it! It's cheap looking and wasn't really that cheap. Material sucks! Worst bears jersey I've purchased.
1.0,"The top is cute and I am so disappointed I cannot wear it, it is very small in the chest area. I ordered a medium and could get it on but it is too tight in the chest. I am not exactly big busters so I suggest sizing up. This isn’t prime so I would have to pay to return it, so I will see if a friend fits into it."
1.0,"An infinity scarf is a loop, ring, or circle scarf. This is none of that. It is a long scarf. Remove infinity from the name. It’s misleading."
1.0,Cute dress but the medium was too small (I usually wear a 6/8).  There was no space for my butt and the bra cup size was too small for 34DD.  Great sturdy material!
1.0,Looks nothing like what is pictured. Sleeves are very short and neckline is much higher.
1.0,"In what world is the XXL actually an XXL? Just holding them up, it looks more like a medium. Shocked that these have a 75% “fit as expected” rating...these pants run super small."
1.0,These sizes are not worth the challenge. The quality of the material of dress is depressing. Look for another ventor with this dress.
1.0,"I wasted 10 bucks on something the size of a nickel. It's practically impossible too get a picture small enough to fit in it, and basically impossible to actually get a picture in there without damaging it. Would not buy again."
1.0,They run small. They giggle in the frames. Not happy
1.0,"Looks good,  good size but the stitching around my ID window is coming apart.  Didn't have it a whole day before that happened"
1.0,One of the posts was bent and the screw back was missing. Very disappointing and would not recommend
1.0,To big for my face..
1.0,They have a terrible smell to them.  :(
1.0,"I was not impressed with this dress. It took months to come and I was so excited to finally get it, and it was terrible. The way it's seen together is awful. Also being so thin you could see straight through it. Worse of all it looked like a sac on me it was so big, and I ordered a small. I wouldn't recommend this dress to anyone."
1.0,you get what you pay for did not like the material.
1.0,"Black frame broke first time putting it on, silver one is okay so far but I expect it to break if I try to take if off.  I would not recommend as they are too fragile/poor quality."
1.0,Weird material. It is loud when you move in it. Feels and looks more like a costume than a dress. Would return but I waited too long
1.0,"While very well made, I was disappointed the case does not accommodate my ""wear over"" sunglasses, OR my oversized sunglasses.  It only works for my readers."
1.0,Not great quality and doesn't look like the picture
1.0,It fell apart -.- will post a picture later
1.0,The leggings arrived with dozens of holes along the seams. The fabric was impossibly thin and seethrough. The fabric also left black dye on my hands.
1.0,I am a 32 A and this is too small for ME. Also scratchy fabric and just overall weird fit.
1.0,Broke it in two months. Bad quality. I do not recommend.
1.0,"The necklace broke when I attempted to fasten it, to wear it for the first time. My husband soldered it, as I had no time to return it before the event. Attempted to wear it again last weekend, and it broke in a different section."
1.0,"First, it took a month to get here.<br />Second, it was so flat and smashed from shipping, it may never be shaped like a hat again.<br />Third, it was so small, I don't think it would even fit a child (my head is not very large)."
1.0,Was going to pack for an upcoming trip and zipper broke immediately.  Poorly made.  Too late to return.  VERY BAD
1.0,"I don't know why I buy theses tunics from Amazon.<br />They come from china.  It's too small.<br />I am a woman made in America<br />I have an American body , not china body"
1.0,This is just silver. It’s not holographic at all and looks nothing like the picture in person.
1.0,"I'm a size 14, I ordered this in an XL. I love the fit and the color. Im a 36C top and very curvy bottom. Girl get in your size and flaunt it..."
1.0,"this mite fit a childs neck,I took the choker part off so I can fit it on my neck."
1.0,"I couldn't even wear them. I recieved them today, but couldn't wear them. One won't open and the other opened but won't close once in my ear. So disappointed and to be honest these deserve no stars. I've gotten 90 cent earrings that are better than this."
1.0,Kept pinching my skin
1.0,"The look of the shoes are cute. However, the incline is so steep on the,arch of the foot that it makes it impossible to walk in the shoes. I actually went ahead and returned the shoes because of this and could not honestly recommend them."
1.0,I got these in the blue and absolutely loved them so I ordered them in the rose gold and they are not polarized! Everything is just blue! I can't even wear them. I'm so disappointed!
1.0,I usually wear a M/L in tops and got an XL just to be safe. So small I could barely get it on! Returning!!
1.0,It is extremely small.
1.0,"I hate this product not only for the zipper that is hard to zip, but the cheap material that easily rips.  I had it sewn once, and now it rips again.  Never bought such a piece of junk.  BUYER BEWARE."
1.0,It’s a good 12mm not big enough for average neckline.
1.0,These are by no way the size they claim to be. It was like ordering from Wish
1.0,My son wore this through 1 football game and the Nike symbol fell off. Wont purchase again.
1.0,Easy  broken
1.0,While it did polish my silver it also left lots of.blue lint everywhere. NO SATISFIED
1.0,Is smelly and ugly i don't like it at all
1.0,These have “made in China” stickers on the top front of every visor.  They are extremely flimsy and of very poor quality.  Save yourself some money and frustration and order something else.
1.0,The bra was way too small. It can off  often and didn't stick at all. DO NOT waste your money. This was a complete waste of money and patience.
1.0,Seam came apart after1st washing
1.0,The straps got damp and turned my feet black...ewww
1.0,"Nothing like the picture.... stiff fabric, very small"
1.0,"The lights didn't even work when I got it, and it was folded up in a little box so it's was all krinkled and wrinkled!!! Will be returning it."
1.0,I ordered a 32 and got an XXL.  Two of me could fit in there...5’6” and 125?  XXL?
1.0,"The style is weird. I returned. I dont like how all the styles look like pregnancy tops. They have a ""u"" elongated front and back. That made it look pregnant.<br />Not like the pictures and not sure unless the reviewers are tucking in the front or wearing something over it.<br />It is horrible."
1.0,"Tight fit and very stiff not soft at all, I don't recommend."
1.0,This bracelet broke on the first wear.
1.0,I was looking forward to trying these out. When I received it I noticed the packaging was opened. I only received one of the silicone pieces! I had to laugh about it and return it because one half certainly won't work.
1.0,Broke on the first time wearing them
1.0,"What the freak is this.!?!? This is legit just plastic, I don’t see how you mold this in a grill.!! So frustrated.!!!"
1.0,"Huge.  Like the other reviews, the band is stiff.  Returned it."
1.0,"This has to be a joke?!? These look like children leggings. Unfortunate because they seem to be made really well just not certain of the sizing or size chart.<br /><br />Definitely a waste of time, money and energy! Ugh!!<br />5’7” | 34 B | 27 W | 40 H"
1.0,Was broken upon delivery.  Threw it away.
1.0,"Despite the images, this isn’t for anyone bigger than a c cup. Wires can accommodate a tennis ball at best."
1.0,"Pants were at least 3 sizes too small!  But rather than going to all the trouble of returning them, I just donated them to Good Will."
1.0,"Worst earrings ever.  They do not look at all like the picture. Cheap, gaudy, not the same earrings shown.  Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"Unfortunately, I purchased a shirt and didn’t wear it for quite some time. The second time I wore it, it was out of the return window already. So I am now stuck with a T-shirt with holes in it. It literally was so thin that it had holes. Never washed but has several pin sized holes in the front. Very disappointing. I guess I learned my lesson to always  check carefully, even if you’re not wearing at the time!"
1.0,The item arrived in a clear bag.  It was not in Hanes packaging as the picture displays and I can't find Hanes logo any where on the item.  It is most definitely not a US XL.  This XL fits my 5'4 130lbs sister who wears a 34 C quite snug.
1.0,Liked the look of the watch and got it for my beach days.  After opening the box I tried it and all of the sudden all the little screws came out.  Fell apart from my wrist which thankfully I was seated and arm on the dresser.
1.0,Hat fades after 2 washes
1.0,"Does not look, nor feel like sterling silver.  It feels much too light to be sterling silver.  The ring has obvious flaws."
1.0,I would like to return this item. The material is horrible. I was looking for a silk or cotton camisole. I am completely unsatisfied with this product! How do I go about returning this item?
1.0,The item was returned. Didn't like the fit.
1.0,I give it one star..really pretty but So ridiculously SMALLER than expected.. wasted money.. took reall long to arrive from out of country
1.0,My son likes the comfort but I don’t like the shape of the neckline. It is almost an oval shaped neckline extending out toward the shoulders. It also appears to gap in the front. Poorly made.
1.0,The anchor broke off easily
1.0,Arrived intact but the bottom pin on the press was welded about a 10 degree angle to one side so upper and lower pin did not match.  This was a construction fault that was very noticeable and should have been picked up during quality control.  I am returning it.  I may order a replacement but I really hate having to pay a return postage for a defective item!!!
1.0,Kept these in my car center console and the frame broke in less than 45 days. Very disappointing…especially being just outside of the return window.
1.0,Way too small for a man & I don’t have a large face or head.
1.0,"These earrings did not even make it to both ears!  The tiny piece that goes through the ear and then clips into the hoop, fell off when I touched it.  Too expensive to return."
1.0,It's not something to depend on it's a knock off.
1.0,"These shoes are the absolute WORST pair of shoes I have ever owned.<br />And this is coming from someone that has an entire closet just for her shoes. I where heels just about every time I leave my house.<br />Anything from 1/2 kitten heels to 5 inch stilettos. These shoes are so ridiculously made and it shows.<br />The arch is NOT a normal arch like a heel is supposed to have. When wearing these I felt like taking more than a couple of steps would make me fall forward onto my face. My feet hurt SOOOOOOO bad after five minutes of these.<br />The glitter and print are cute. Hence why I bought these. But there is SOOOOO much glitter that it’s scraping up against my skin and leaving abrasions.<br />I tried wearing thigh highs with them hoping that would help with the glitter caked strap scraping up against my skin, but I merely ruined a 25$ pair of thigh highs.<br />Sending these back would be a pain.<br />And I wouldn’t give these away or donate these awful things either.<br />Please, ladies; despite these being SUPER cute, please think twice about buying them. They will be an absolute waste of money.<br />There are TONS of other cute glittery heels on the internet, buy those first."
1.0,Not true to advertisement. At least one size smaller than advertised.
1.0,Not worth the price! Huge disappointment for my mothers 70th birthday gift
1.0,Dress is adorable as long as you don’t wash it! Washed on cold delicate and all of the white is now pink. Should be specific and state that it will bleed! 😡
1.0,Came in broke
1.0,Way to small!! Ordered a large and it was more like an xs!!
1.0,Terriblemente Orrible
1.0,"I ordered a size up, per other recommendations. Was still very small and would not at all give the slouchy look I was going for. The knot was also very cheap and almost gaudy looking. Will be returning."
1.0,"Way too short! Loved the look, but it fit boxy, short and wide. I have a long torso so this is being returned."
1.0,I am tired of receiving the wrong size.  Obviously to difficult for someone to read a number.
1.0,"The sweat does not look like the picture,  and it's real thin, and more of a peach color."
1.0,Arrived dirty and missing buttons
1.0,"At first glance, these earrings are very pretty. I was so excited to try them on and then OUCH! The wires are about twice the thickness they should be and were incredibly painful to wear for more than a few minutes. Even if the wires had been thinner, the earrings don't hang correctly. These are a big no for me."
1.0,VERY POORLY MADE. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE. WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT.
1.0,Didn’t like fit. Too wide
1.0,"Not what was advertised, really disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Scuffed out of the box.
1.0,"The straps do not stay in place, there is a cheap clasp put on the shoe, where is the actual hook for it stay? Poor, cheap quality."
1.0,Not what I was looking for. I may get use sleeping in them.
1.0,It came damaged 😣😢 It would have been more to Return...
1.0,"interesting, I hated these slippers.  If you use them to walk around the house regularly, the soles get smooshed and stop cushioning your feet from the floor... the back lip doesn't come up high enough; you can't keep em from falling off your feet when you sit and cross your legs, dangling one foot in the air.  They're not warm.  If you want warm slippers, these suck.  I'm happy with my down booties from REI...  I'm surprised people love these.  Must've reviewed when they were brand new..."
1.0,The worst i ever owned
1.0,"Fit was awkward, large in some areas and tight in others despite the stretch material. No. marking of GV on the material jean themselves as in the original products.  Tag is sewn in and that seems un-authentic for GV.  Return requested and was sent mailing address - I have to pay for return postage and they stated they would charge me an additional return fee of $8.99.  This is unacceptable!  I will not order form Overstock or Overstock Toyz ever again.  DO NOT RECOMMEND - FAKE ITEM."
1.0,"The stem that connects to stud, which goes through ones ear was defective and dangerous. The stem piece was ragged and rough."
1.0,These run so small I got almost 2 sizes up and still way small and the material they are made of fills chep
1.0,Post broke off of earring first time I wore it.
1.0,Got this for my wife.  Medium fits like XS.
1.0,No certificates provided for gem. Does not look and feel like a gem at all.
1.0,I purchased these boots for a friend that liked the looks of them online.  Cheaply made and ugly.  I was embarrassed that I even bought them.  Needless to say they went back.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap they look super cheap not good at all
1.0,"Bought this for work and liked the light...easy to read since I work nights. Had no problem figuring out how to set the time and all that. The only problem I've had is that the buttons are too sensitive. The time will reset if I accidentally hit the button and not notice and hit one of the other buttons.  I hang it on my backpack when I take it off so I know exactly where it is when I need it and if I should forget to put it on the next morning, by the time I get to work I have to set it again because it bouncing while I walk changes the time.  I dont recommend unless you dont mind having the wrong time."
1.0,I wanted my purse strap to be longer so i use my purse as a crossbody and its exactly same length that already have
1.0,Not what I expected looks cheaply made and the boots are paper thin on the bottoms
1.0,It cost to much for its value and it breaks very easily and is really thin I did not like it
1.0,Very very difficult to get the clip to open to attach to glasses. Returned
1.0,"This is a robe, i dont know where the reviews came from but if you want something to lounge around at home with then this is it.  This is definitely not something for you to wear out."
1.0,"This was too small and paper thin.  I was sent a return label, but would have to pay shipping which would cost more than the shirt and take forever.  It's awful to just throw money away."
1.0,SUPER SMALL!!
1.0,The robe is good quality but it's a little misleading to market it as a Kim + Ono brand kimono.
1.0,Simply a too-small piece of garbage. It reminds me of something you would get out of a gumball machine when you were a kid.  Don't waste your money on this.
1.0,"Super cute style that can be dressed up or down. I really wanted this shirt to work. I washed it once before wearing it and the zipper pull broke off in the washer (top loading without an agitator!). I was so disappointed. Unfortunately I ordered 3 of these shirts while traveling on business and by the time I got home, washed the items it was past the return period. I haven’t washed the other two yet but after my first experience, my expectations are low."
1.0,I sent them back because they ripped when I pulled them up.  I have two other pairs and they are fine.  The quality and sizing changed
1.0,These cleats are garbage. They were delivered 9/3 . It is now 10/6 and the sole has totally worn off the shoe... on both cleats. I was looking to get a season out of them for a 7 yo. Not even a month.
1.0,"I ordered a  large even though I wear medium. The outfit was very, very, very small! Won't order from ClothingAve ever again!"
1.0,"Relatively low quality print, along with a bulky and uncomfortable fabric that feels like it was taken off of a backpack. Looking to return it."
1.0,4/9 white tank tops that I ordered were stained from the blue tank tops.
1.0,do not waste your money this is a very cheap jacket
1.0,Cheaply made. Broke the second day. Too much trouble to return
1.0,"I am writing this via my husband's account...While in theory this blouse works, especially when it's photo-shopped in the photo provided to sell the product...but...this blouse is a box!! If it were cinched in under the bust line like an empire waistline then it would work, but as the blouse stands it's just a box...I usually wear a medium to small top (36C bust) and this thing swallowed me whole with a medium...a small would not have been any better as the cut would still be bad. The sleeves are pretty and they fit well...the material is a pretty lace and seems substantial,  but quite sheer requiring a cami underneath. This item has potential, but not on a smaller frame...it needs reworking...add some elastic under the bust line and draw the excess (and there is much!) together in the front...the draping will be better and the whole look will be flattering...as it stands now, not flattering at all! Needless to say, it's going back..."
1.0,Ripped putting it on. It was super cute but dissapointing. Would not hold air. Had to hold it together in two places just to try to get through egg hunt
1.0,It is bright yellow gold plastic... looks like the cheapest version of a halloween costume you can find. The photos don't do it justice. Really disappointed... it should be 2 dollars at best.
1.0,Does not look like picture and material cheap.  No shape to it. WAY TO BIG FOR MEDIUM
1.0,"I gave this bracelet to a friend as birthday gift and when she put it on the magnet fell, and the silver material is very shiny."
1.0,"I bought this as a first jewelry kind of gift for my son who lost his sister. We’ll, he tried it on, it won’t adjust to his size so now it’s a waste of money thrown in a bag in a closet somewhere. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,These are orange sunglasses.  Not night driving.  I returned these.  My search continues.
1.0,The necklace was too small/definitely not long enough... Big waste of money
1.0,"Good for the price, would get the job done, latch is not the best quality,  but I think they'll hold until my good ones get replaced....<br /><br />Updated Review after actually trying them out in the snow!!<br /><br />Not what I hoped... the vent holes where not made correctly, so they fogged as soon as I put them on, you get what you pay for... good quality ones go for $20-$xxx, you won’t be saving money at the end and won’t be satisfied either... my advice, find something better."
1.0,In order I didn’t receive my belt to my pants
1.0,"I'm a medium, got a xl and it doesn't fit the chest at all."
1.0,"I love this jacket. . . the navy color. . . the style. . .the inside pockets.  It is very nice, except for the zipper.  It is hard to connect at bottom to the small head and get it zipped up.  I had ordered the suggested size from comments.  When it got here, it was too big.  Almost exchanged but when I tried to zip up the return, I just couldn't get it to go.  The zipper is weak, and the fact that I cannot even get it to connect and zip back up when it is brand new is a deal killer for me.  Very disappointing because it is nice other than that."
1.0,"Disappointed, too small, not what I expected"
1.0,Not worth the money since the buckles won't even buckle! I had to take them off and just tape them. the shoe is useless without the buckle anyway.
1.0,"Thought it was adorable and fit great! Then when I bent down to pick up my infant, it ripped up the back of the pants. You get what you pay for, I suppose."
1.0,I work in a freezer unit for only a few hours a day at around -20F and the first time using these even with hand warmer in them my hands were still numb and the zipper snapped on both the first day I used them. maybe more for casual winter and not for working in.
1.0,Ordered two pairs all 4 “paws” were for the right hand. They also were too small. Some fingers were glued shut completely. I normally wear a small size in gloves. I returned them.
1.0,These are very hard too uncomfortable had to return
1.0,"I had to give them away to my friends sister bcuz it didnt fit my 10 yr old. My daughter is petite but has a behind tho, when it arrived and I opened the package I was like..WTH IS THIS??!!!! Not what i expected and I went wit the chart but I guess it wasnt for my daughter. The leggings actually fits more for an 6 or 7byr old in my opinion."
1.0,One sock has a hole right in the middle of the foot.
1.0,"Cheap material, shorts are so long they look like high waters!"
1.0,"This dress is SO SHORT. I’m 5’8”, 150, and my hip bones are naturally wide and there is no way I can wear this without scaring children. The medium size fit loose in the hips and arms but it lacked length.  I really liked the other version of this dress which is red and longer."
1.0,Very cheap material. Only used one day bc straps got detached. I could of gotten a costume at walmart for 15 bucks and better material.
1.0,"Perhaps in the country where this product was made, the size fits the people it was made for.  It didn't not fit this Anglo-saxon American however."
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product.  I have worn SPANX for years and have had them last for a very long time, even after going through the wash.  This pair ripped in the crotch and butt area (multiple holes) the first time I wore them.  They were not too small, if anything a little big.  I would not recommend and will continue to try to find the ones I have bought in the past."
1.0,"Not true to size, not stretchy at all I’m returning them:/"
1.0,As I got it I found it already torn under the zipper.  And its quality is super cheap and not worth the money.  So dissapointed :(
1.0,"Unfortunately these are super thin and webby so they get caught on things, start ripping easily and I would not wear outside an intimate setting."
1.0,"cute, like the charms, like the bands, but.....you get what you pay for.  It is cheaply made, falls apart constantly.  We've had it 1 1/2 weeks now and have had to put the owls and birdie back on.  The rings holding them are cheap, too.  The bands are more plastic like than leather.  I wouldn't buy this again.  It's a cute idea, but not worth the hassle.  It is just a matter of time before one of the charms falls off without noticing it missing and losing it permanently.  Would not give this as a gift.  Unless they receiver would not mind cheap faulty products."
1.0,This cant even fit a child.... you guys should put runs small in ur description.... cause it was a waste of money
1.0,"The photo w/ the product on the model is misleading! That is not what you will get, quite disappointing. If the item is not from China, i would have gladly return it!  Had i known its from out of the country, i wouldn't have ordered it. If there is a ZERO STAR, this product would have earned it!<br /><br />Pics provided for better understanding of this review, and i dont usually make reviews."
1.0,This is a high cut (hip area) short torso bathing suit!!!!  NOT AS PICTURES ARE DISPLAYED! Also RETURNS WILL COST YOU MONEY AND THEY ARE VERY INCONVENIENT! purchase with caution!
1.0,"I was sooo excited to receive a bracelet that represents The school I graduated from but I’ll have to insist on a refund for this product.  The clasp is tarnished and unsightly and the the UH emblem looks so poorly made, not at all like the picture! False representation on such a great idea of a bracelet."
1.0,"ONLY GET THESE IF YOUR EARS ARE ALREADY STRETCHED BECAUSE THE WAY THE TAPERS AND TUNNELS ARE THEY WILL RUIN YOUR EARS!!!!!<br />The color is wayyyyy off and I did not like them at all. The tapers don't help with stretching so I wouldn't get it to start stretching. The way the Tapers are they go up a little bit and then they're just BIG like there is no transition from the beginning of the taper and the big end of the tapers. The Tunnels you can't even use unless your ears have been stretched to that size for a month or two, WOULD NOT recommend."
1.0,it is not as expected and it is not worth the price
1.0,Quality is not that great. For the price i really expected something better. Mask was too big. I will take it to a tailor now to fix it.
1.0,"Nothing was working, battery? I dnt knw"
1.0,I wear an XL in American sizes so I ordered this top in 3x and it fits like a US Medium... Only buy this top if your skinny with a small chest
1.0,Where is my dress ???<br />I didn’t receive .
1.0,Doesn’t hold shape at all
1.0,I expected it to be better than others... But totally disappointed.
1.0,2 of the 3 necklaces I purchased as a pack were broken. My daughter waited awhile for this delivery just to be met with disappointment.
1.0,Too small. High price to pay for something you need to use a magnify glass too read.
1.0,This does not fit true to size.  Fits WAY smaller!!
1.0,gave away
1.0,"The dress does not have a way to stay up. While it fit my daughter who is perfectly proportioned for it, there is literally no elasticity and the corset sits too low to even hope to fasten a strapless bra to the dress. Beautiful design. Poor construction. Forced to return unless wearing as a skirt!"
1.0,"Horrible design, not exactly like picture, like a knock off. And btw with covid I cant get ahold of amazon but I returned this due to size and a run by buttons and dont have a refund.<br /><br />Someone please contact me"
1.0,"took forever to get. the whole item looks dirty and old and not in an antique way. even for a ridiculously low price, so not worth it. threw it away."
1.0,Way too small! Super cheap quality
1.0,Poorly done ! Not even close To what it's supposed to look like !!! Do it right or don't do it at all I say !!!
1.0,"The mask is very porous and relies on the filers for protection from receiving nasties, but the check valves suck and are basically just holes. So very minimal protection if any, but easy to breath through- but not even dust protection."
1.0,"First, I purchased my size based on reviews. They were way off. I purchased a 3X and should have purchased a large. But the fabric of this costume is very cheap, it had no shape, and certainly does not look on like it does in the advertisement! I returned it."
1.0,These boots are not what I expected.  They fit smaller than my shoe size. The fur lining is very thin. They would not keep your feet very warm if you had to be in the cold for any length of time. I sent my order back.
1.0,"I loved this, but it broke last night. Very disappointed."
1.0,Not durable at all. Son is constantly tripping over floppy part of sandal under the toes. Do not recommend.
1.0,Not impressed. It was large in the top half and tighter around the waist area.
1.0,Cheap look n feel
1.0,Very low quality and not the exact same as the photo.
1.0,This product came dirty and the strings were missing very disappointed this was supposed to be my birthday dress unfortunately it wasn’t . Returns are clearly not checked thoroughly
1.0,More than half of them did not work when I received them.
1.0,Smelled of clear nail polish. I have this to my 10 year old. It seemed to suit her rather than someone older.
1.0,"Very ugly and cheap looking in person, though the picture seemed so beautiful. I sent it back and my refund is processing."
1.0,"Watch kept falling off, returned it."
1.0,I received this item and it was crushed in the box
1.0,"It appears very bohemian in the picture, but in hand this choker has a very ""cheap"" look. The quality matches the price."
1.0,"Not happy at all this product was miss leading. It's not peridot, the stine is actually yellow."
1.0,"Description says set of four, got a big whopping box filled with only one"
1.0,"Dress had many damages along the selves and mid-section, and coloring rubs off and looks faded"
1.0,"Never even received this product. Got a refund through Amazon. I did however buy two so I got the other one (just different color) in the mail. It's total junk. Very cheap looking and the watch doesn't even work. What a waste. I was originally going to give this as a gift, but when I saw the quality, I couldn't even imagine giving someone something so cheaply made, how embarrassing. So it's just sitting in drawer collecting dust. Maybe I'll just give it to the dog to chew up?"
1.0,They run huge!!!! I bought the 18-24month size for my 21 month old and she probably won't be able to wear them until she's at least 3 years old.
1.0,Rusted. Enough said.
1.0,ordered a medium- more like an extra large. Material is thinner than paper. looks more like a little kid art project than a bathing suit. nothing like the picture
1.0,"Did not get gold necklace , received silver and not even the same design! Not happy"
1.0,Too small don't fit not stretches to put fit  returned
1.0,These were not at all as described or expected. They did not have the fleece inside and instead were thin and see through like tights.
1.0,"You show 6 coin purchases and with a price, nowhere does it say how to pick a color or that one is all your getting. Really false advertising!"
1.0,"Faded the first day i wore it, then tangled and i could never unravel itm"
1.0,The masks are not 3 layer as advertised.  They are single layer and extremely thin.  Will not help to prevent any spreading or contamination
1.0,Needs to be made with more depth!
1.0,Sizing is way off. Get 3 sizes larger.
1.0,I like the fact that it’s foldable but this hat is just too flimsy. A tiny bit of wind and it flies right off. I haven’t been able to wear it.
1.0,Band broke where it connects to watch face after a week
1.0,Received the wrong item. Got a bracelet instead of Sparex.
1.0,The hinge for the arms are made of plastic and just have a screw going through them. The plastic hinge broke after a year.
1.0,they're not very strong..I let him open the package up and he put them on his head and the frame already bent and broke...like I get it he's a kid but hes not even that rough. im surprised. kinda bummed out so dont think ill order these again :(
1.0,"Uncomfortable, will be returning."
1.0,Ordered 13 of these for an adult softball tournament prize and sent them all back. The sizes provided are not correct. The necklaces are a choker and closer to fitting my wrist than the bracelet. The bracelets are smaller than a pop can.
1.0,I have been waiting to travel again to use my new sunglasses.  Well  the sunglasses lasted about 5 days.  The side piece broke off already. I am very careful with my sunglasses (I'm not a kid).<br />I recommend to look for something more sturdy.  This is a piece of junk.
1.0,Not as expected. Makes you sweat as the inner lining is synthetic not cotton. Look wise okay.
1.0,"This is false advertisement. I am 5 feet 10 inches, and 142 pounds and the extra large was tight on my frame. The material is very thin and upon deliever the zipper was ripped."
1.0,"Loved cheap, sent it back."
1.0,After 2 washes (not dried in dryer) the graphics are all peeling off. Such a waste!
1.0,Item was torn when received
1.0,"I was very excited to find this unusual bag. When I recieved it today I was totally disappointed. The &#34; Leather&#34; is stiff almost plastic like. The straps are definitely plastic and  are too short to use as a shoulder bag. The design of the bag is unusual which drew me to the bag, but in reality the design limits the use of the bag as a tote for me. The positive is that the bag appears to be sturdy and well made.  I did recieve this product at a discounted price in return for a fair and honest review."
1.0,Run very small order two size up .
1.0,"I was going to use it for a halloween costume, but looked more like a kid size than an adult size"
1.0,"I have a few vostok watches and I bought a variety of aftermarket bezels for them.  I cannot get this bezel to fit any of my vostok watches, while other bezels fit straight on easily.  There appears to be a manufacturing tolerance issue with this bezel."
1.0,"The right side of the goggles never had a full seal. I would constantly get water. After 3 uses, the rubber seal completely unravelled.<br /><br />Very disappointed. There's not a way to contact the seller to ask for some type of exchange."
1.0,Horrible! It arrived with a stain on the white area of a stripe. When I washed it by hand the black bleed into all the white stripes. Then i hung it over the tub to dry and it stained my gorgeous new tub. Took forever to get the stain out and still not completely gone.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT! I've been through all this and haven't wore it once.
1.0,This was supposed to be Marine not Army
1.0,I wanted to give this as a gift to my son but it arrived with a slash on the lower front. :( so I returned it
1.0,Not a Proportional fit
1.0,Very big - uncomfortable. Returned immediately
1.0,The product differed from the picture. It was not runched in the back nor was it as long in the back as pictured online and my wife is not considered tall at all. The material was very shiny and threads were unraveling. I will be returning.
1.0,I was waiting for weeks for the delivery and when it finally came it was too small
1.0,"This is the worst, not even 1 minute of wearing it, it broke! I waited 2 days and it broke as soon as I got it! I do not really appreciate that it broke! I don’t think you should waste your money on it!"
1.0,For starters it has a hood. And upon trying it on it looks like a giant poncho.
1.0,"and the only way to get it open broke the chain.  So, yeah.  Kinda worthless."
1.0,"The dress is two sizes too small, even when using the merchant's sizing chart.  I returned it, but couldn't exchange it because the merchant discontinued item..<br /> Very unhappy."
1.0,This picture looks nothing like the merchandise.  It looks like the foam you spray on a new construction home and it smells wierd almost like rubber.
1.0,"Nothing about these boots to recommend, unfortunately."
1.0,So tiny like best for a small child.
1.0,"These glasses are just &#34;yellow tinted sunglasses&#34; . There is no HD Vision, in fact they actually decrease the amount of light received by the eye and should not be worn from dusk to dawn. They may reduce glare on bright cloudy days."
1.0,"Cheap....Cheap.......Cheap! These literally snapped being put on my face. I had them 1 week. Frame is a brittle plastic. Lenses were extremely dark, where you couldn't wear them in overcast conditions, or you wouldn't be able to see. Stay away from these glasses! The ones you buy at Walmart, Target, or Walgreens are much better. That's not saying much. Buyer beware."
1.0,Wore a few hours and turned my finger green
1.0,One word.....Junk!
1.0,"Not the skirt that was pictured. The elastic is different, there’s no bottoms with it, just a mesh skirt"
1.0,BAD QUALITY! Does not fit or look like portrayed in picture. Material of leggings is cheap and unforgiving even for a size 4 person. The seams come off on first wash. I do not recommend this item.
1.0,Thought the earrings was bigger than that for the price too little
1.0,Not good as expected..
1.0,"This product is why I wait a little while before posting reviews.  The adjustments with the tool went swimmingly.  I loved this bracelet.  And then, this week, a pin snapped.  I could have made due and replaced it, but the pin was the &quot;first&quot; pin, the longer one holding the piece where the Alta snaps into the bracelet.  So, now I have a worthless bracelet.  I'm tempted to replace it since the price has halved since I bought it but I'm more likely to look for an alternative, sturdier solution at this point.  I don't know where I can just purchase the pin I need to fix it, but if it were easy to get, I'd get that."
1.0,"We purchased these shoes five months ago and my son didn't wear them very often but the structure of the shoe broke down quickly. The heel just disintegrated and made the shoe too loose to wear. Cool idea, loved the lights and the concept, but poor quality shoe."
1.0,The pendant fell off one of the posts 3 times in the first 3 days of wearing them.  I used pliers to try and tighten the loop and prevent the pendant from falling off again.  The last time it fell off it was lost.  $13 for an earring I wore 3 times.
1.0,"To small, not even close to the size. Very Disappointed"
1.0,It is very cheap product I pulled one string and the whole sleeve came of don’t buy it
1.0,"Where to begin....<br />I didn't get what was described or what I saw in the photos.<br />First and the biggest things that upset me was the color.<br />The description says brown, the label on the bag it came in said brown and the photo shows a BROWN bracelet yet, I got a black bracelet. Why?<br />Second, the anchor, which in the photo looks like metal is more like a plastic coated with a shiny layer of silver...plastic? Looked and felt super cheap.<br />The bracelet itself is more like a coiled necklace. I was under the impression that you could tighten it at either end and adjust it to fit your wrist...no. It's one big rope. You have to twist around your wrist. No adjusting.<br />Also, the way it lays on your wrist is horrible. It's stiff and doesn't lay flat, it stands out. So annoying.<br />The rope itself is just cheap plastic material. I thought it'd be kind of leathery and soft but not the case at all.<br />Returning immediately!<br />✰ I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my honest review✰"
1.0,"Not well made , material is thin and polyester,  patterns don't match up"
1.0,Got very weirdly and the material wrinkles easily
1.0,Twice as big as I expected.  My mistake was not reviewing the size.
1.0,horrible rash. do not buy this product.
1.0,DOES NOT FIT AS POSTED
1.0,"I ordered a 3X just to be safe. I'm normally a 2X, the bottom fit just barely, and the top was designed for a teenagers A cup boobs. How is any woman suppose to fit a womans actual breat in those short no space, not even in a sexy but in make ur boobs super flat bottom lining comes up to high in addition to top being too low doesn't give u any room at all to work wit. I was going on vacation and wanted a cute new bathing suit, instead I got an overpriced overflawed design and now will have to use my all rags, extremely disappointing waste of money dont buy, and if u have an actual ass the shorts will get eaten. I love pin up, this a terrible design."
1.0,"Comfy slippers, fit was pretty wide but my feet are on the narrow side. The reason for one star is that one day after wearing them I noticed a hole on the side. Other than that they are very nice slippers."
1.0,Broke in a day had to return. Cheaply made
1.0,This shirt is horrible don’t bother wasting your money. It’s so thin it’s ridiculous and it’s not cotton it’s some weird material
1.0,. I was disappointed because it has elastic and is the belt is too large.
1.0,It broke the day after we bought it. The front face and ring came off.
1.0,"I am a size 4. Had to send back the small and medium, both were too small."
1.0,"Really light and comfortable, super cute, but I live somewhere humid and it made the color run and stained my feet<br />Edit: these sandals only lasted 5 weeks before they broke, I wore them a total of about 20 times :("
1.0,the garment is shapeless and poorly made.<br /><br />very unflattering.<br /><br />Final Thought: Would not recommend.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:aa7c5bfd8f7f9455153406f630da156a]] Strap came off in just one use, look at video"
1.0,MADE FOR A PRE TEEN
1.0,Dress wasn't worth keeping! Made from cheap material and thin! Returned next day!
1.0,"I searched for a cotton tank top.  This blouse clearly has the word COTTON in the title.  When it arrived, the tag indicates it has NO cotton in it at all.  It's a great looking blouse on the models and the color is nice, however, the arm holes are huge and the blouse is very long.  it would look great on a 6', big boned person, but not the average woman.  Before I can wear this, I will have to alter the arm holes and shorten it.  I had wanted to wear it this weekend but have no time to do so.  There should be penalties for bait and switch advertising, like misrepresenting what an item is made of, digitally enhancing products so they look better than they are, and making misleading statements in item descriptions."
1.0,Not happy with the fit and didn't have tags on to return it. I won't be purchasing from Cocoship again
1.0,"The fabric is a cheap cotton that will need ironing, already not a hit with me. The fit was weird — large in the waist, short-waisted, and overall too short. The style is definitely for the younger girl, not for a nine year old. My granddaughter liked it but not enough for her to keep it. I sent it back."
1.0,I ordered a 4x size. The shirt I received was apparently mislabeled as 4x but it  is a much smaller size. I am returning it.
1.0,I purchased this watch but it doesn't work.  It's a piece of junk.
1.0,This dress was huge on me I’m usually a small but it fit like a large! I’m 5’4” and it was down to my knees. The tie was on my hip not my waist! Really upset because I thought this dress would be great!
1.0,Had dirt in it.
1.0,The color of the neck piece stains your skin!!!!
1.0,The outfit I received looks absolutely nothing like what I purchased. I received a blue and gray round neck romper/lounge wear...not the beautiful hunter green and brown v-neck rompers as pictured on the site!!! I'm very disappointed! Let me also add that i'm 5'4 and it fit/ hangs short. Uggghhhhh
1.0,Boy extra large was way too small ...material way too thin
1.0,"Cheap, gross feeling material"
1.0,Hood ripped off after I pulled it over my head on day one mind you I order a 4x and I wear an xl so it would be big at the gym so I threw it away. Wouldn’t buy again waste of money
1.0,"Cheap and awful watch, save your few bucks and get something better. Watch stopped working only the second time I wore it (didn't even get two full uses out of it). Please refund me."
1.0,"Too minimal, too SHORT...<br />The photos shown depict the smallest of reading glasses, and still don't give an accurate impression of just how short and constrictive these useless straps are.<br />a) They don't grip the arms, at all - you have to push the ends way up over the glasses arms, which makes the back portion even shorter. They'll fly off anytime - not handy near the water for example. Leading to...<br />b) Too short! Can't be slipped on and off the head easily, hangs in a constrictive way hugging the back of the neck.<br />c) Classic GWYPF (get what you pay for), cheap and not worth it.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED."
1.0,"So disappointing!! I bought this dress to wear at Disneyworld, as soon as I put it on it had a small hole on the side that was unnoticeable. Throughout the day, this small hole turned into the entire side of my body being exposed! It ripped from armpit to thigh on the side. This was so horrible and embarrassing. It’s not worth buying something cheap and low quality like this!!"
1.0,Poor review because it doesn't work. Scratches the skin and doesn't stay in place.
1.0,Not flattering and bad quality
1.0,"These are the most comfortable jeans. I've got hips and a smaller waist so they sit a little baggy just below my belly button where I like them but are almost too baggy in the waistline on the back side.  Overall through the thighs, they are comfortable. I will order another size down just to have a snugger fit. Love the overall fit though! Purchased 22. Will purchase a 20.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/31/19 HAVE WASHED THEM TWICE AND THE BUTT HAS SPLIT IN THEM. WHO KNOWS WHO SAW MY PANTIES IN WALMART JUST NOW. BUYER BEWARE."
1.0,"These are not squat proof.  I ordered three pairs because 90 degree are my favorite leggings but, I think I got a defective batch.  I returned two pair because the seam in the back started to unravel.  Unfortunately, the third pair I kept now has a hole in the back...and it happened when I was squatting at the gym.  It is also unfortunate that my 30 day return window has closed.  Also, they had an odd plastic smell that never went away."
1.0,Order triple your size!
1.0,The fabric of this dress is way too thin. Even without stretching the fabric it is compeltely see through. Definitely regret this purchase. I wouldn't buy this.
1.0,One of the pair came broken 😞
1.0,Fit good and comfortable but tear WAY TOO EASY. After two weeks the back side ripped so bad its like there wasn't one too begin with. Not worth the money. Cheap material and cheaply made after fastening the button few times the button came off so had too stitch it back.
1.0,"This is not a size large, it fits very snug and I wanted a looser fitting pant which is why I ordered size large."
1.0,"I ordered TWO pairs of these. Both pairs I ordered were ordered size small!!! Well the first pair was perfect !! They are comfortable and great to be lazy in! Well the second pair, the coral ones have a tag that says small but they are more like size 3x."
1.0,Also very high waist right under you boobs. I took the dress with the returned label provided by Amazon and took it to Kohl's not sure why I haven't gotten a refund yet on Amazon.
1.0,The shirt fits okay... but the pants are awful. The crotch is almost down where my daughters knees would be and the pant legs are so short. Very strange. Would not recommend
1.0,Flimsy and no support at all.
1.0,The material very cheap
1.0,I returned immediately.
1.0,These are uncomfortable and cheap looking. 😕
1.0,It came with a really bad odor. I washed twice before finally wearing it. But it still good a little odor. Will never suggest buying.
1.0,"Pants were comfortable, although the fabric felt a bit cheap. Unfortunately, the elastic next to the crotch and butt seams started to fray after only a couple wears. I even air dried them to prevent this from happening. Would not recommend."
1.0,Too small and I got another pair and they didn’t work 😒 tried to return and I have yet to receive my money back
1.0,Very disappointed.  Way to small . Will not be ordering from this company again . This shrit is marked 5x but it's doesn't even fix my daughter who wears a large in shrits
1.0,Super grossed out.  Dress arrived smelling strongly of perfume and had a used chapstick in the pocket.  WTH!!
1.0,Very large!
1.0,"This is that cheap scratchy polyester that kids pajamas and Halloween costumes are made out of. Nothing like the photo. The writing on the sleeve is backwards and could only be read in a mirror. So so so cheap, returning!!!"
1.0,Enormously big.M size fits XXL.
1.0,I hate this hat.
1.0,Very small and it always flips upside down. Also the chain is pretty long
1.0,"Clasps won't stay locked! They are very tiny, clasps don’t stay locked. Basically they are junk."
1.0,I tried the XL and the Large and either way the pants were too tight and too loose in all the wrong spots. Material was okay but in my opinion not for working out in. After wearing them through the day the fabric would expand underneath the back side causing this droopy look which isn’t flattering. Also waistline would loosen up as well. It’s like these pants were for  heavier with skinny legs.
1.0,"What is not discussed in the ads for these soles is the type and pattern of the existing shoe sole.  These don't work unless the existing shoe sole is perfectly flat and even...treads, molded patterns, etc. make it impossible to glue on the new sole unless you do a lot of grinding to get a flat surface to apply to.  Recommend buying shoes with smooth leather soles and then having them resoled at the shoe shop as needed."
1.0,chart said shirt size was for a 4-5 year old. It was big enough for a 10 year old! I had to pay return postage; not happy!
1.0,Broken tie.
1.0,"After wearing them for a week, the plastic bit too fake the stone fell out. I glued it back in and then it fell out again. I repeated the process 4 times before giving up. The only reason I could wear them if due to the super glue I applied. Buy something better."
1.0,"The band will snag on and pick clothing. It ruin my suit the first time I used this watchband.<br /><br />The band probably will fit most wrists, as the description claims, however if you have  moderate to large hands the watchband will not slip over your hand without the ends coming apart. After that happens it takes effort and coordination to get the band fastened one handed."
1.0,"First, I ordered a size larger than normal, and it was still too small. Second, the fabric is super thin, so be prepared for that."
1.0,This is so cheap!! It’s not a blazer just a shirt w lapels . This item should not be sold for more than $5 that’s how cheap it is!!!
1.0,"I lol’d when I took these out of the package.  The cups were so close together,  no way can I wear these"
1.0,I brought these socks to wear with boots while out for a couple of hours watching a ski jump in 30 degree weather. I wore a lighter pair of socks with them just in case and my feet were still cold.
1.0,I ordered a 7” bracelet and received a 9” bracelet. That was a gift for my pre-teen daughter.
1.0,Terrible sizing and the letters fall off in the wash. No wonder it’s so cheap. It’s at least 3 sizes too small maybe more. The small fit my 10 year old
1.0,very thin and do not breath at all.
1.0,Unpleasant
1.0,Really wanted to love this dress. Unfortunately the seam between the top and bottom portion ripped apart the first time I tried it on. Sizing was perfect but the quality was awful.
1.0,These were an awesome shoe until the left foot stopped working a week in to owning and only after wearing once daughter was very disappointed also the button to turn on the lights gave her a huge blister on her ankle. She love these when she opened them for her birthday now just disappointed because she can't wear cool light up shoes.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:fd1d3593c2789a1b9eb0d3a4a9f9aac5]] I don’t even know if this dress fits, because I refuse to put it on as it is. The packaging was opened but glued back together in a messy way.<br /><br />Then the dress was inside-out. I was disgusted and shocked to find thick white deodorant stains under the arm and all the way down the sides of the dress. I have never seen such awful presentation from any Amazon seller. No one checked the product??? I needed this for an event. I’m really annoyed!"
1.0,The quality was poor. Returned.
1.0,broken before I could I put it on! Not worth the money. Plus the star in the middle wasn't red. Seemed strong but not put together well! I returned for refund!
1.0,"I ordered an Xl and it fits like a teenager's outfit. I'm 6,2 185pounds. Xl should be plenty for me. The picture shows a full beard and the one that it comes with is like manchu santa... don't be fooled by the picture. The quality is poor."
1.0,The inside layer of this dress bunched up so bad after it was washed that she couldn't wear it again because it was hard
1.0,Not as pictured.  Flimsy and huge even when tighten.  Not sure why reviews are positive.
1.0,Cheap  Cheap cheap
1.0,"These are boys shirts, not men’s. I couldn’t even try it on. It was a nice shirt, so I gave it to a 12 year old."
1.0,Way to small 😢
1.0,Ordered it for my daughter. She didn't get the tail like expected on package. Only fox ears. What a disappointment. Because whats the ears without the tail and vesa versa.
1.0,"Poor quality and stretched out and there was no snaps on the bottom to get in and out, awful"
1.0,Material was awful almost like sandpaper spandex
1.0,Color was darker than shown and the fabric was flimsy. This was the lowest quality item I have ever seen for that price. This is awful and the return process has been the only enjoyable part of the transaction.
1.0,The spacing is weird and the bras have a cone shape that makes them uncomfortable
1.0,Horrible went through my baby ears
1.0,"La tela de blusa es calurosa y fea, bonito el modelo pero tampoco queda bien."
1.0,"Tunic is 2 or more sizes smaller than expexted. Appears to be good quality, beautiful print, ... which doesn't help, if you cannot wear it. Lesson learned, if ordering from Co. which markets to Asian women, must order 2 or 3 sizes up."
1.0,The Left flip is smaller/shorter than the right flop. In one day (absolutely zero exaggeration) the cushioning under my heels is completely compressed and hard as a rock. The sandal straps also quickly stretched.  I was planning to buy additional pairs in black and dark brown...but now must reconsider. I've been wearing Reefs for over 20 years. This is the first pair that has failed me.
1.0,"It is NOT as pictured: it is too wide, too short and the fabric is extremely inexpensive looking."
1.0,"I loved the style of these earrings, but once they arrived they are very clearly not sterling silver as they irritate my ears. Another pair from the same brand does the same thing....advertised as sterling silver despite not being."
1.0,Two of the crystals had already fallen out when I got the bag out. Returned.
1.0,"there are several unforgivable issues with the design and description of this piece. this is not a 'Theosophy Religious Symbol'. Theosophy is not a religion, nor is the Theosophical Society a religious group, whose insignia this is (founded by Madam Blavatsky et al in 1876). This is a composite of ancient symbols created in the 19th century by the society, although not quite. The star at the top of the pendant is incorrect, albeit politically correct. The true image there should be a bent, 'spinning' cross.. The Nazis, in the 20th century, reversed the 'spin' of the cross and used it as their symbol, thus, when casual viewers 'see it' they are aghast. i must assume the manufacturer of this item (not the society) decided it would not be able to sell the jewelry with it on it so did their 'switch'. Yes, the saying 'there is no religion higher than truth' is correctly attributed to the society, BUT the focus here is on the word TRUTH and not religion.. sadly lacking in this piece and its description IS 'truth'."
1.0,"If you're looking for blue leggings with stitching to mimic the look of jeans, these are for you. They are not denim.  These are more representative of the pajama jean leggings. I doubt that I will ever even wear these in public. Definitely overpriced for the type of product received."
1.0,"Plastic broke on every pair before the end of the day, some before the end of the day. Buttons are cute, the rest is not good quality, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Broke, too flimsy."
1.0,Horrible Elastic...
1.0,"Some of the necklaces did not light up, waste of money"
1.0,I ordered a taupe bag that was pictured and described and this is what I received. I do not like the bag at all that I received. Not my taste
1.0,thank goodness it happened after leaving the beach. But a waste
1.0,They really strech out and are very big and loose..
1.0,Tag ripped off during second leg of trip. Complete waste of money. YOU HAVE ONE JOB!
1.0,This is a piece a garbage. And I can't even return it. I was trying to put it on for the first time on Mother's Day. The necklace got broken. Now I'm stuck with a piece of junk.<br />I give them a zero
1.0,"I have had these for less than a week and they are already chipping. I went to put them on this morning and the black coating over the wood is deteriorating off and making a mess. I am definitely disappointed in this product, they are super cute but poorly and cheaply made. I wish I could get a refund!"
1.0,"The material and quality does not match the price tag! I couldn't be more disappointed, especially since it was a gift. Please look elsewhere for much better Animal Crossing hoodies offered on Amazon and other websites. Don't purchase!"
1.0,Piece broke away from stud the first time I tried to unscrew. I was very disappointed.
1.0,The fabric looked and feel cheap
1.0,Beautiful earring. Just so thin that they bend under the pressure needed to close the clasps. Very challenging to get them fastened. I will be throwing them out.
1.0,the strap broke the first time putting the slide on.... it would cost almost as much money as i paid for them to ship it back
1.0,The arms are so tight it cannot be worn by anyone who has more flesh than a skeleton. The dress fits as described. Why the company decided to make the arms so small is beyond comprehension. Will have to make my own sleeves for the wife for next year. Halloween ruined this year because it could not be worn without cutting the worthless sleeves off.
1.0,Horrible quality. Didn't even fit. Waste of money.
1.0,They are wearing on the front and have a dent forming. I have been wearing these for about a month and not on a regular basis and they are not holding up for the money I spent. I am beyond disappointed and cannot even return them. Almost $100 thrown away for flip flops that are not holding up. I guess I will just stick with my Sanuks
1.0,The watch is too small.  The band is too small.  It feels like a child's watch.  I hate it.
1.0,Very poor quality. It came apart after I wear them once.
1.0,Horrible fit! So uncomfortable!
1.0,these were so thin I would have been better off with saran wrap
1.0,The dress was such an awkward style and overall it wasn’t the quality others made it out to be.
1.0,Mine broke and the clasp was so cheap and would stick it's a waste of money
1.0,Loop that connects to the watch broke after 6 weeks.
1.0,these are SO flimsy. I've ordered the same dimension earrings from other sellers and they weren't this flimsy.
1.0,Lol they broke within a week sorry for the bad comment in not that kind of guy but I really wanted something better 😊 thank u tho for the time 🙏
1.0,Ring in the right index finger was not the same ring dislayed
1.0,"This hat came all folded up and bent out of shape, and you can not reshape it to make it look good. It looks cheap."
1.0,Strangely shaped and completely unflattering.
1.0,Bought these and they run hott and the v neck is a joke it's so high.
1.0,No where near as good as the pictures show its cheaply made and way too short
1.0,Keeps falling off the keys lost it twice luckily found the charm but this is not durable for a set of keys
1.0,"The colors were cute, but the shirt was way to small. It was also not as long as pictured so you your midriff would show."
1.0,Flimsy. Cheaply made.
1.0,It can hardly fit<br />Ripped easily<br />Cannot use as elastic
1.0,"The boots reeked of chemicals and mold the second they came out of the package. The black part of the boots looks fine, but the edging at the top of the boots is peeling away and sticky to the touch. Now that it’s sticky every piece of hair, dirt, etc. sticks to the edges—which looks really nice for professional settings. The top front of the boot flares out quite a bit; more than showed in photos. The foot bed is a little narrow for a regular width boot, and pinches my toes even though the length is fine. Some of this is probably to do with them being flat for a month while shipping but may get better with wear (if I am able to get used to the chemical, mold smell). I don’t know if attempting to break them in is worth it when they smell and look dirty. I wouldn’t purchase this brand ever again."
1.0,Thin fabric and very cheaply made
1.0,I'm not sure how to get these to stay in place!
1.0,"Its cheep flimsy.  the watch is so small , might be ok for a child, but not an adult. I am sure the bands will break in no time.  Very disapointed"
1.0,Worthless in the rain
1.0,Mask is nice exactly like the picture. Extremely late on quoted time frame. Sent out super late.
1.0,"Don't wash this.  It will fade really bad with the very first washing.<br />I wish I could get a refund for this, I LOVED it until I washed it."
1.0,Poor material! I am 5’9 and was not long enough. Would not waste your money!
1.0,"I like the arch support design but the rest of the boot is much too roomy and the ""laces"" can't tighten.  At the price quoted I didn't think they'd be authentic leather but I certainly didn't thing they'd be made of cheap-looking upholstery material."
1.0,"If you’re able to view what I ordered versus what I received, the difference is clear. I ordered the vibrant emerald green & received a dingy army green, which was an option but not one I wanted. The material isn’t quite as soft as I’d anticipated based on other reviews. It’s not awful, just not what I ordered nor wanted. It’s a gamble sometimes diverting away from actual Amazon products & due to costs of shipping for returns I may be stuck with it."
1.0,This is HORRIBLE!!!!!
1.0,"It is not a clock...or it doesn't work.  Whatever, too much money for a piece of crap!"
1.0,"I asked for a size 10, based upon my previous order which I sent back because it was big...I did not get a 10, instead I received  another XXXL...<br />They Mixed up the sizes...I did launder in very hot water and dried on hot temp. It did shrink some but is still big. Guess I will eventually wear with a top under.<br />It's kind of cute for a summer evening at home when you want a very loose fitting garment."
1.0,Seams are off... sewn crooked.
1.0,The shirt was misspelled...”Talh to me Goose” LOL the return was easy and quick.
1.0,I went two sizes up to and the pants were still extremely small. I can even wear them. They look fantastic and really cool. I am just disappointed that I cant wear them.
1.0,"descoforme completely, as different from mine sent me a product, I did not like, sunglasses to buy for those who pay and they sent me a different model that I did not like."
1.0,Didn’t like it. It is NOT a shoulder dress. More of a cover up for a bathing suit lol. I’m going to order it again and go down two sizes. The material feels nice!!
1.0,Only second time putting this on and I went to zip in up and the metal on the zipper crumbled and broke off. Very disappointed and would not recommend this suit.
1.0,"I ordered this cause I have an extremely hard time finding bras that fit. I literally looked at the woman in the picture and figured if her gajungas can fit, so can mine. was I wrong. First off, the underwire is the most uncomfortable... thing ever. It does not bend or form, it's just painfully stiff. Second, I had to get a clasp extension cause it was to small for a plus size bra. And even then it's a pretty snug fit and my girls start to hurt after a short while of wearing it. And third, the straps, omg, the straps. The most uncomfortable straps ever fabricated. They rough. The adjustment is not very much. They just suck. Hands down one of my worst bras that I own that will live in my never to wear bin until I gather enough stuff to donate. Very disappointed."
1.0,Fits everywhere but the ankle has zero stretch and can’t get foot through .
1.0,These run  wayyy smaller in sizing.
1.0,This dress looked NOTHING like the picture. The image was distorted and blurry and it wasn’t even the same color!<br /><br />I was so disappointed. Don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,The worst quality I’ve seen even for costume jewelry. I was not expecting top quality but this item looks painted in a gold finish. It’s very very yellow and not something I would wear. Does not look like picture.
1.0,Plastic!!!!!
1.0,If I would have known that this shirt was being sent from China I never would have bought it. The quality was horrible and it did not look like the picture. It was more like a dress. Very disappointed
1.0,"This is a very, very cheap item. Not worth even the 2 bucks. Not as pictured. Avoid this line of scarves."
1.0,Delivered broken and it doesn't look anything like the picture
1.0,"I am larger busted and 5'4', the dress was way too short. It was more like a tunic shirt length. If I wore it outside, it would just look like I forgot to put my pants on.  Also it didn't fit nicely as a shirt, it lands strangely on my chest and looks unflattering. Even though it's inexpensive, who wants to waste their money and energy dealing with unwearable merchandise? It might be good for a much younger girl, not an adult. Also better if you're small breasted."
1.0,I ordered a 4-5t and a 2-3t.  The pants are the exact same size so I'm not really sure what the point of the sizing is.  The shirt is only a time bit smaller too which doesn't make any sense to me.  If your going to get a 4-5t that's fine but I would not buy from here any smaller as they are going to be huge.  Really big bummer since these were suppose to be a cute matching gifts and it clearly isn't going to work.
1.0,"Don’t waste your money on this product, as u can see the paint on the frame is falling off, and is sticky, they send me a replacement but it was worse."
1.0,They were not good it didn’t last at all and broke. I have to buy new ones now. I wouldn’t recommend them.
1.0,"The gown is 100% polyester per the inseem tag that is sewn into the gown. The gown is advertised as 100% cotton. I only sleep in natural fibers such as cotton. Therefore, the gown was returned. I didn’t try it on so I don’t know how it fits but the review site made me pick something. Due to false or inaccurate advertising and the inconvenience that put me through, I gave one star because I can’t give none"
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture when you try it on. The shirt is ridiculous, doesn't even cover the bottom of my boobs and I ordered an extra large, I'm a c cup.<br />I'll keep the skirt but it's definitely way to big to be high waisted.<br />Don't waste your money. I guess I got what I paid for"
1.0,Turning orange - not silver
1.0,"It's very disappointing, not worth spending the money"
1.0,"This swimsuit is so pretty on paper, but when I got it there was absolutely no support in the top and the bottoms were way to small even when I bought a size bigger. I was so disappointed in this suit :("
1.0,"For the price, they're alright"
1.0,The flowers on this shirt are more like blurry blobs.
1.0,Purse is smaller than I thought and it’s also more a dark mauve color than purple. I’m returning it.
1.0,Cheap plastic handle and wheels and it is light as a feather. Lifted it from the Amazon box and realized it would never hold up to travel. It is not as shown in the pic--small and cheap and light. Buy for play but not for travel!
1.0,so bad i threw them away.
1.0,Why did I let my son order these?
1.0,"Cheap plastic, could have gotten a better set at the dollar store"
1.0,These are the sorry . I've had them 2days an the insole is rolled up. They are no good. Sending them back
1.0,I bought my usual size in bra and it’s not that is doesn’t fit it just gives your boobs a horrible shape and supports nothing. The stupid front strap does NOTHING. Literally has no use. You’re better off using a normal strapless bra… at least your boobs won’t look oddly shaped.
1.0,This was broken
1.0,"Very VERY cheaply made, I don't recommend this at all. Very cute but not worth your money 👎🏽👎🏽"
1.0,"the sleeves areway too big around almost half the size of the waist, and its super big in the shoulders and runs down to my thighs. take whatever your usual size is and go down a level or two if you want it to fit!"
1.0,I was very unhappy with the dress it was to small  and to tight not true to the size
1.0,Buy 2 sizes bigger... Or you'll be very disappointed.
1.0,"It looks cheap, not worth buying"
1.0,Product did not on Friday day when called they said it will Saturday! But it’s was delivered on Sunday morning! Prime is useless!<br /><br />It’s cheap material!
1.0,I was excited about receiving this item. To my disappointment this was not true to size at all. *BEWARE* this skirt runs very small!
1.0,Very disappointed. The product did not fit to my watch.
1.0,This shirt is poor quality and looks like its made of dish rag material. The bottom is stretched out and I received it with a snag in it already. I hate this purchase and waisted 17.00. :(
1.0,"VERY thin and see through, too short, and too small. Not nearly as cute in person as it is on this model. And I'm guessing the model is wearing a size XL as well."
1.0,"My 10 year old piercings are 16g, but I couldn't get these in without pain. Left me sore and red for a few days afterwards and the metal part pops off occasionally."
1.0,"I wore this bracelet for exactly 2 weeks and the charm is already falling off.  No, it is not the most expensive thing I ever bought but I did expect it to last more than a month.  Not happy, totally disgusted and will never purchase again."
1.0,Problem with this shirt is uneven hem. Looks weird.
1.0,"Not even close to,correct size"
1.0,Just received item with a hole in it!
1.0,I bought these bells two weeks ago and one has already broke. Poor quality. Not sturdy at all cheaply made!
1.0,Color slightly different.  Brown can be tricky
1.0,"Every day watch. The face is to large for me but ok. The day display is to small and at 72 I have trouble reading it. The instructions with the watch are poor. The band just fits and I have a medium wrist. It works and is accurate so far. Disappointed!<br />Updated<br />After two days stretched to 4 hole. Getting used to the large face. Still cant read the day, if I could do that I'd move this to 4 stars.<br />Updated after 3 days<br /><br />I woke this morning and my watch was stopped. Yes I wound it when I got it. Wore it night and day and I've been active. There is no good reason for this. The watch is bad."
1.0,"Too small, NOT COTTON. Falsely advertised as cotton."
1.0,"The mask is super thin and small. It does not fit the way it looks on the picture at all. I gave it to my 7 yr old son who also complained about the size. I bought the mask to go with the head band that I bought and love from the company. Smh, I should not have."
1.0,"I didn't return this as I wanted to because I got busy, but I'll never wear it. I usually like the arms to be a little bigger because I have larger arms it seems, but these sleeves are a mess. They have inches of extra room and just dangle off my arms like some weird attachment to the dress. Not chic or fashionable at all. Really wish I would have had time to return it."
1.0,"Does not have the swivel alligator clip, it has a clip without a swivel, it's not an alligator clip, faces only one way and keeps falling off my shirt"
1.0,Seemed ripped the first time I put it on!  Poor quality.  Save your money and buy something else.
1.0,when<br /><br />i put on the belt it went on fine but the release to take belt would not work there was no way to get the belt off i tried every thing .that was possable to get it off I ended up hafting to cut it off I had three people tring to get it to release. it junk.
1.0,"Why do I keep trying to purchase Chinese merchandise? It almost always runs small. This time I did order up a size, still too small. Are they trying to tell Americans something??"
1.0,Arrived broken... Super cute. I'm bummed.
1.0,To large for my glasses.
1.0,The shirt was nice up until I washed it. Been washing laundry since I was a child. The material shrunk way too much on the first wash. I washed it in medium water with a cold dry The shirt no longer fits me. Such a bummer. The collar looks like a hair scrunchy too. All my other dress clothes came out great. Even if I wanted to wear it open. It's so short it barely passes my hips. Lesson learned... Spend the money on a good shirt.
1.0,Extremely popr qaulity
1.0,"Came in earlier then expected which is great except it runs very very small. I read some of the other reviews where people said to order a size up and I'm usually a medium so I ordered a large, well their large is like a regular s/m. And the material is very very thin and doesn't seem like its good quality. I will be returning mine back as its too small and not worth the price. Trust me looks better in the picture then it does in person."
1.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews.  These shoes are incredibly cute but didn't last more than a day with my girls just shuffling around in them.  It wasn't like they were yanking stuff off but the flowers and soon the shoes started falling apart.  It's like the company forgot to use glue.  We've been gluing them back together but geesh, they should have lasted longer than two hours."
1.0,Too small. Would only work for a child.
1.0,I was so excited for this shoe to wear to my rehearsal dinner. I wore 2-3 times prior to break in and sole began to come apart. I reached out to seller and they refunded me $10. The next wear the strap completely broke during walking down the isle. When I reached out to the seller they claim they fulfilled the order and won’t do anything. If you want a $40 pair of shoes to wear 4 times these are it.
1.0,Didn't try on the quality was not how it looked in the photo.
1.0,"The skirt was nice and thick. Good color. But, no point in wearing the product if it doesn’t work. tried on the skirt two times. Once to see if it fit and the second time to wear it out. The skirt didn’t even make it out of the house before the zipper broke"
1.0,"These are cute, but very small (more child sized than adult), thin, and difficult to turn on and off. I wouldn't count on them lasting long at all."
1.0,Came with broken metal part of the strap.
1.0,the product was no way the quality for the high price . wanted to return it but was not allowed<br />so disappointed.
1.0,"I was a bit disappointed  that they came out of the wash smaller and very wrinkled.  Since I use them for my nose, they are still serviceable.<br />Update:  Well, not as serviceable as I first thought.  They become balled up in my pocket and are just like a piece of kleenex, thin and flimsy.  Would not recommend them now."
1.0,Not even close to the item pictured. Words are on the back of the shirt instead of the front. Design isn't even the same. Looks like absolute garbage. Don't buy this
1.0,Very light clingy fabric. Neckline very out of shape
1.0,La chaqueta Michel nunca llego a la dirección suscrita.
1.0,"I was excited about these.  The socks fit great and stayed in place while wearing.  However, after the second wear several got runners in the toe.  Other pairs I have, of a different brand and material, don't have this issue."
1.0,Is there negative stars option available? I ordered this a 5 yr old size for my 3 yr old it still didn’t fit. It’s so small. Looks like just to get it sold they are selling a 2 yr old clothes as five years old. Very angry and annoying. Returning.
1.0,It was not vey good the finish all peeled off very quickly would never buy another one!!
1.0,"I read some reviews that said it runs small, so I sized up. I wear a large but the X-LARGE enormous and the neck open was huge. I bought a very similar Amazon Basic shirt and the quality and fit were much better at a lower cost. Unfortunately I put it in my gym bag and had to wear it. One wear and it heading to Goodwill."
1.0,Cheap and awkward fit
1.0,I ordered my usual size but was very small
1.0,"I ordered for a wide foot. This calf of this book is minimally 2 inches wider than my leg, if not more. And still tight in the foot. I have chronic lymphedema which cause swelling in my legs...even at my most swollen, this boot's proportions are still ridiculous. And the faux leather upper feels,looks and sounds like a rain boot. I will be returning once I figure out how 😐"
1.0,Bad quality. Returned
1.0,Had to return. The hardware is too bulky and very disproportionate to the entire shoe
1.0,It’s like wearing a T-shirt.  It looked terrible!
1.0,I ordered half size larger than normal and it was still too small.
1.0,watch latch was broke JUNK
1.0,"Bad ,too big ,recieved broken."
1.0,Wish they little bigger and that they feel out
1.0,I wasn’t a fan it didn’t look or feel anything like leather!!
1.0,Cheap and ugly.
1.0,"These are litterly awful, they are so tiny I could not get the spike off and it would not have even fit in my septum hole."
1.0,"Beware! Press on sticker, cheapl! Looks like a shirt you would buy at the dollar store. It wasn’t even worth returning it, as I was required to pay for shipping, more than the shirt was worth. TOTAL LOSS."
1.0,"Based off of  recommendations, I ordered this in a large. When it arrived, it was the size of a super size dress. The length however was perfect. So, I returned it and ordered a medium. This fit better in the bodice, but was the length for a child  I am only 5.5 1/2, and this came to my calves.  Needless to say, I'm returning this one as well."
1.0,They look like preteen panties. Size medium was not made for women's sizes
1.0,Poor quality. They didn’t light up so I ordered two more replacements. 1 lights up but is very dim and the other you have to squeeze it for it to shine. Would not recommend wasting your money on these.
1.0,"This face mask came with a pamphlet that shows how to put all the layers together.  It was easy to follow.  But my mask is missing the inner most layer, which is labeled in the pamphlet as a ""Food Grade Silicone Ring"".  This ring is necessary to form a seal against the face.  The mask doesn't sit very tightly and there isn't a very long strip of velcro so it isn't very adjustable.  The fan is pretty loud.  Would not recommend."
1.0,Dress hem was sewn onto top and I was unable to undo it.  Shoddy work on a really pretty costume
1.0,"Not the studs you see on the pictures. Worst they even came broken, I do not recomend this under any circunstance."
1.0,It looks pretty at first but it isn't 92 sterling silver as described. I would return it if I didn't have to go to alot of trouble to do it. Would never buy from this seller again unless they make it right? I will let y'all know!
1.0,Came missing the small part that secures the band after it passes through the buckle.
1.0,"Absolute Garbage. DO NOT BUY. Poorly made, cheap materials and like everyone else says... the eyelets stsrted coming off on day 2."
1.0,This is NOT the shirt pictures! The material is different (hard to prove but I can tell) and the print is similar but NOT what is pictured. It looks and feels like an old lady shirt. It's not ugly but it's not cute either. Save your money ladies!
1.0,Horrible!  So thin I could see through them.  Not what I expected! I returned them.
1.0,Too thin you can’t tell they are paws on the ring. Don’t waist your money. I didn’t return it because of the Pandemic but I should of.
1.0,"Cheap material, it was very wrinkled and had the feel of a Halloween costume."
1.0,This blouse is terrible quality. Looks nothing like the photo. I pulled several long dark hairs off of it and it was pilled up like it was used. Awful product.
1.0,Poor sizing!  I followed their size chart.  Item arrived so small it would not wrap around half my waist!  Tried to return it but was told I would have to pay postage to china!  Waste of time and money!
1.0,The blue peels off partially right away. I tried to take the rest of the blue off but it wont come off. This ring is very pretty for about 3 hours
1.0,The material is so cheap that the teal dress is practically see through and unwearable
1.0,These where so cute but hurt my feet
1.0,"Cheaply made, wouldn't purchase again! There's even a fingerprint where the silver was sprayed onto the clasp. Very lightweight, the other parts of the bracelet moves and I am pretty it's not suppose too. If I weren't overseas, I would send this back! But with how much shipping will cost me, I am stuck with this junk!"
1.0,"If I could give this crappy dress zero star, I would. Omg the dress did not fit and it looked so cheap and nothing like the picture. It also did not fit the way it is supposed to. I am truly disappointed."
1.0,"this was an xtra large and wouldn't fit a small figured model. Looks like a crappy, thin material worn out shirt. Got Totally screwed on this one. F-tards"
1.0,"Not as pictured at all. They were black as ordered, but that's the extent of the comparison."
1.0,Crap. So cheap. Came just about broken as soon as I took it out of the packaging one broke completely. Unwearable. Don't bother. In the trash as soon as I opened it. What a waste.
1.0,Watch stopped working after a month
1.0,Broke apart in the front after 5 months. Had higher expectations for a shoe I paid a lot of money for. Will never buy this brand again.
1.0,"I ordered an I Love Winter Springs key chain, luggage tags and tank top and would've appreciated being notified that these items would be delivered as I Love Florida instead. I also ordered some I Love Florida items as well, that were correct"
1.0,Doesn’t fit way too small
1.0,The fabric is AWEFUL!!  It may soften after it’s washed but i wasn’t taking the chance. RETURNED!
1.0,"I was very Happy to see the dress and when I tried it on it looked very pretty. I had ordered two different dresses and so I decided to keep this one since it fitted well and looked nice. Low and behold when I wore it and walked out of the house it tore on the shoulder! I had to rush back into the house with a torn dress, so embarrassing! I want to return it. It is certainly not worth 30$. It’s not worth anything it should be taken off the shelf and returned only when the quality of the product is improved. Such a shame"
1.0,"El empaque decía XXl y yo me asusté de antemano porque soy M, pero cuando lo abro veo que se mira muy pequeño y me percato que la tela no es spandex y por consiguiente el producto no me sirve. Es la 1ra vez que Amazon me decepciona y espero de corazón que sea la última."
1.0,The image on the case is painted on and came off on my daughter's clothes the first time she used it leaving a paint stain.
1.0,They should REALLY come with the little rubber backings that come on new post earrings... only got to wear these for an hour before one fell out. So disappointed.
1.0,This should be made to last through toddler roughhousing but in 2 wears the screw cake out and the glasses were all bent.. and this was just from car wear. Do not recommend although they look really cute
1.0,It's too big since it has no size and what I got is different from the picture I saw...so disappointed 😕
1.0,This is not the same material as all the other solid colors nor does the size run the same as others
1.0,Extremely poor quality. It is one of the only things I’ve ordered from Amazon that I’ve been so disappointed in!  It arrived broken and is very cheap quality. I’ll never order it again!
1.0,Does not fit oakley half jackets. Too small
1.0,Arrived in pieces so I had to return it. Seller told me the factory had problems with the adhesive. I wouldn’t trust this item not to fall apart when my granddaughter used it so I did not reorder another one. Buyer beware!
1.0,It’s not comfortable. Material is very stiff.
1.0,I've been wearing compression stockings or socks for over 25 years. These aren't true to size and the don't stay up on your your legs. They fall down as soon as you walk
1.0,This necklace was obviously very cheap (~8$) and I did not expect amazing quality but what I do expect is the seller to send me the item they advertise in the pictures. I did not receive the item in the picture. It is clearly not the same. Very disappointed and I am so tired of sellers that trick buyers like this.
1.0,These are the SMALLEST nose rings I’ve ever seen. Very false advertisement.
1.0,Does not cover very well
1.0,Size didn’t match size
1.0,Very small and didn’t hardly cover my ears
1.0,The zipper on the right side pocket fell off and the seam started to come undone all after one use and wash.
1.0,DEFINITELY NOT SILVER. Very disappointed the pictures all show the clear strapped sandals with silver studs but when received they are gold. That is literally the only reason I ordered them in the first place.
1.0,"You get what you pay for, it's very cheap but so is the price."
1.0,It broke when I took it out of the package.
1.0,I ordered this for my mom. It's a little tight but extremely short. I don't recommend this.
1.0,Poor quality  the zipper keep sticking  and rough material  poor quality
1.0,Doesn’t stay tightened.  Very annoying- don’t wear
1.0,"Very thin material, see through. Can't wear in public, safely.<br />Returned to Amazon via UPS and accepted by Amazon 7-13-18 @ 9:20 am ET, but Amazon refuses to refund my checking account.<br />Therefore I do NOT recommend buying this item, especially from Amazon.<br />Poor quality and even worse customer service."
1.0,Iron-on image onto a cheap t-shirt.  The size is way too large.  Do not buy!
1.0,I do not think is original. The package was very cheap and said made inthailand and packaged in china. I paid the full price pandora $58 and i was expecting the real original pandora with warranty and nice box. Not s flimsy cheap cardboard bix made in china with no warranty. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!
1.0,The back of them came all vented smh will be returning them!!
1.0,"This product took two weeks for me to receive and when I finally received it, it had no form to the hat at all. The quality is very low and it is definitely the cheapest looking hat I have ever purchased or seen in my life. Returning right now."
1.0,"Tons of unnecessary fabric and fit it too large. Size down. If you're typically a small, don't waste you money on this."
1.0,My daughter wore them once and the bear fell off. Not too happy with the quality
1.0,Nunca me fue entregado el pedido
1.0,Poor quality. Too small.  Didn't look like same material as in pictures
1.0,"These are probably the same junk selling 3 for $10 all over Amazon. Don't bother paying more: the fit is so bad that they hurt, and the optical quality is dismal. Too bad, because the compact fold and case are a great idea."
1.0,Sadly I had to return this dress due to the cheap quality of the dress. The top part of the dress is fine but the black part on the bottom is very cheaply made and doesn't look very good. It also bunches in all of the wrong places. I really wanted to like this dress and if they increase the quality I would try it again.
1.0,If I could leave 0 stars I would. Not for heavy chest as it says.
1.0,"There was a lot of extra material in the crotch area. If you have a super long torso, it would probably fit true to size- however if you don’t, it’s going to be too baggy"
1.0,"This may look cute in a Xs size, but this does not look cute any larger....looks like I took it out of my grandma's closet. Looked like a cheap cotton sweater."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. Fabric is heavy, rough. Not flowy at all like the picture shows. No leg opening like the picture showed. And I requested a return and I have to pay for shipping. Just very bad"
1.0,"They tarnished, very poor quality. Made my ear lobes itch. Shouldn't get any stars."
1.0,"Was very excited to see the incredibly low price on this sink skirt; the excitement faded when I realized the shipping cost more than the item itself.  The skirt was functional and attractive for about 3 weeks before the adhesive failed.  It should be noted that the skirt was not removed, agitated, or washed during the three weeks."
1.0,Right shoe must of been molded wrong.  It felt like it was on the wrong foot.  It didn’t fit right no matter what I tried.  Had another person verify that it wasn’t just me.
1.0,Not true to size or picture. The stitching is horrible and looks like my child put it together.
1.0,I love these. Unfortunately they broke the first time I wore them which was five weeks after purchasing  them and the return window is already closed so I’m stuck with broken earrings.
1.0,"I was really enjoying this bag, but only 4 months after I purchase it is has ripped and become unwearable... and unreturnable.  Don't buy"
1.0,"Zero stars.....I had to choose at least one. I wear a 32C, weigh 108 pounds and am 5 feet tall. Very petite. The size small covered only HALF my body. Do not purchase. I know you get what you pay for but C'MON! Worst."
1.0,"The strap broke the second time I wore them, i don't not recommend them. They are cute but not very well made."
1.0,Hello<br />I did not anything about it. It was totally different from the picture. I was not expecting a thong better for 16.99.<br />However it looked very beautiful in the picture. I must return it. Please provide a return address. Thanks Angie
1.0,Tassels are cheap and don’t hang well. It’s definitely more of a cover up than a dress.  Fits small and short.
1.0,"Way too small and not at all as pictured. This is a lot more sheer than the picture suggests; the color is not nearly as vibrant. It was very short and didn't even come together in the front. I would return it but my 4 year old saw and wanted to try it on. Now she's parading around in it saying she looks like the emperor on Disney's Mulan. If it weren't for the dress up factor and the price being what it was, I'd definitely return it. But if you wear anything bigger than a petite 6, I really wouldn't suggest this."
1.0,Didn't like it. Material looks like crape paper.
1.0,The measurements are very distorted. The crotch comes to the mid thigh area. I’m not exaggerating. It looked very odd!
1.0,See through and very flimsy
1.0,"I saw the many negative reviews on these earrings but gave them a shot anyway.  I really liked the style and that they were not large as are most ear climbers.  I purchased these for a wedding I am going to on Saturday.  I received them yesterday and well my hopes to receive a perfect pair were immediately dashed.  First, one of the faux pearls was missing and second, they did not have any backs, which is easily fixed but nonetheless, they did not have backs as they should.  Sorry I wasted my money.  Too bad as they would be so pretty if not for the missing pearl. I looked in the packaging to see if the pearl had fallen off in shipment and I could glue it back but no such luck  Save your money and listen to the reviews as I should have done."
1.0,I was unable to wear this ring. The edges were too sharp.
1.0,"What arrived was the wrong collar style and missing the cummerbund, tie and cufflinks.  All shoved in a plastic bag and obviously pre-worn.  Terrible quality control and promptly returned."
1.0,"I purchased this cloth and the Sunshine brand.  I totally wasted my money as this is I believe a defective product or very old and dried out.  Completely ineffective, extremely disappointed.  In fact after trying to get results with this brand new product to no avail I went back to my completely blackened from use Sunshine cloth that was ready to be thrown out and got a better result in removing the tarnish.  Sadly I can not recommend!!!!"
1.0,Cut way to small
1.0,You get what you pay for. Band look and feels really cheap!
1.0,Not the best quality material. Not sewn well. Not worth the money. I tossed it.
1.0,Zippers on the end broke in less than a week.
1.0,They took a week longer to get to me then I what I was told.  The brown ones the lens was out and the clip that holds them on glasses was broken. The green part lens did not fill the frame.<br />they seemed very cheap not at all like the one I was replacing.
1.0,The size was correct but the sleeves where to short.
1.0,Sizes are way off!
1.0,Different material looks horrible
1.0,Definitely is not true to size
1.0,It fell apart
1.0,Quality was not worth the price
1.0,The shirt pictured and the one I received were similar but not the same.  Material is lignt and cheap and the shirt is much smaller than predicted.
1.0,It looks very gaudy and cheap.
1.0,I’ve only worn this about 5 times and the belt looks so worn already. Outside of my return window so I can’t return it. Not worth it all.
1.0,Glasses broke within a week
1.0,"I was looking forward to receiving these mask given current quarantine.  It took sometime to arrive which is understandable.  However, I was disappointed upon the arrival when I open the packages.  The mask does not contain an adjustable ear wrap as seen in the picture.  It is a thin piece of Polyurethane/Polyethylene (I may be wrong on the material) but it can easily break and not reusable for multiply use or wash.  Unfortunately I am returning all 9 that I received."
1.0,I was going to use for bridesmaid dress
1.0,"Got the bra today full of white streaks that look like deodorant marks. Hopefully they will wash away but upset that my ""new"" bra looks used"
1.0,"This ring looks and feels like plastic. Everyone in my family firmly believes that it is, indeed plastic. It's like a piece of jewelry for a little girl to play dress up. I was skeptical with the price being so low, and I'm sorry to say that my suspicion was confirmed. This item was dull and appeared scratched on the sides right out of the bag. I am returning it."
1.0,For the price I expected a nice sweatshirt for my nephew's birthday. Instead it came with fabric already coming apart. with cheap plastic fuzz everywhere. and the quality was terrible compared to the picture. Spend the extra money. This will fall apart after the first wash.
1.0,Material has a sheen
1.0,Garbage change colors right away
1.0,"Casual, comfort wear. I ordered a print and a solid medium, the print looks and feels terrific, the solid fit was one size to small."
1.0,"Item said it fit the Samsung Galaxy watch 4, 40mm and 44mm but was way too small when received"
1.0,"Very low quality. Colors are way off, the husky will not be white, it will come in whatever color you choose. The sleeves are uneven and one is 2 inches higher. The design is off center. Very disappointed."
1.0,"after only wearing it for about 2 weeks just this morning it felt of my wrist and it broke apart, very disappointed"
1.0,"Nothing was wrong with the product. I expected a different fabric, so they were returned."
1.0,The jacket size does not go with the pants size-I ordered a size medium and the pants are way too large and real long and the jacket is like a size small-so all in all not a very good set in my opinion-the only reason I did not return it is that I use the pants to lounge around in-the jacket fits a stuffed animal very well though LOL!
1.0,At first I loved these but after wearing the light colors I was shocked at how dirty they were getting. I tried cleaning them to no avail then I realized it's the actual color coming off the bands. Disappointing. Decent if you only want dark colors
1.0,"It arrived with the chain broken.. I was gifted it to a 5 year old yesterday, so I thought “not a big deal since it shortens the chain”. Silver linings right? Then today I realized the pendant has fallen apart.  Total waste of money. Please don’t ignore the reviews!!! Don’t waste your money!!!"
1.0,"It looked nothing like the picture,  this dress is horrible"
1.0,The circumference of the gaiter is too narrow for an adults face.  I wear to keep the wind off my neck.  When you pull it up to your chin and or over your nose it crushes your face down. Too tight!
1.0,Smells horrible!
1.0,I bought these for post surgery. I wore once and my husband washed and dried them and the top shrunk but the pants didn’t. I can’t wear the top. Very expensive to wear only once.
1.0,For a wind breaker I expect more secure wrist closure . This jacket had only elastic that left open the sleeve. I returned it.
1.0,Unless you are 5 foot nothing and weigh 100 pounds do not order the “small/medium”. This companies size chart is complete crap and customer service is a joke. Good luck and please do not support this company.
1.0,Don’t do it !! Cheap material
1.0,I ordered the black one and ended up getting one with white straps! Had to return it
1.0,"the three charms (clear, red, blue) fell off the first time I wore it."
1.0,Awful. Doesn't stay in. Don't buy!
1.0,To cheaply made piece of junk
1.0,Delivered broken
1.0,I’ve had this band for less than 6 months and been using it for less because I bought it prior to my Apple Watch. It is pulling apart where you slide it into the watch. I certainly think the band should have lasted longer than this.
1.0,Cheap fabric and cheap PVC print... thought the wrist bands on the arms would be fabric. They're PVC or vinyl. Doesn't seem to have longevity whatsoever.
1.0,Small in waist. Small in length. Even went 2 sizes up still didn't fit right. Not made for curves.
1.0,"Cheap looking material , I got it and I can’t find a use for it"
1.0,One pair had a large hole in them. Fit was perfect. I followed the note to go bigger if full booty and legs
1.0,Our watches do not fit
1.0,The print was not as expected and definitely looked like someone ironed the image on.
1.0,The elastic band broke the first time I tried to use it.  I can replace it myself but shouldn't have to.
1.0,The holes for ears make the mask awkward and now we hear NO gator masks like this for school so we cant really use them.
1.0,After less than month of use the leather began to peel. Very disappointing. Don't buy!
1.0,Nice shorts just too small
1.0,Had it on for an hour and it broke. Tore right at the wrist
1.0,Fabric was weird. Way too small.
1.0,"Looks NOTHING like the picture, is made of some CHEAP toxic plastic table cover feeling material and the colors look like those you would find on a child's birthday balloon, nothing like advertised. the zipper broke after i tried it on the second time and didn't even go anywhere in public in it."
1.0,"The 22mm springbars I ordered, were four, really nice 20mm springbars, from Barton. There was an Amazon label (22mm), applied over the original Barton (20mm) label. Guess I'll just order from Barton next time."
1.0,It broke within a day of wear it. I didn't pull on it or anything. Just got up and it fell off.
1.0,"Decsription says 100% Cotton.<br />I purchased 1 Black,1 Dim Gray and they are NOT COTTON.<br />95% Viscose<br />5% Spandex"
1.0,I was very unhappy with product. My daughter was going to wear these for a wedding she was in. They did not run true to size. Also from the picture it did not show that on the clear part that it said bebe.
1.0,"I was super excited to wear these, however one broke while trying to put it on. Cheaply made product. Never got to wear them. The body doesn't stay connected."
1.0,"The slippers look a bit odd, like they could fit either foot. No clear right shoe or left shoe. Very odd. They fit a bit too snug. The soles are robust to go outside, which is what I was most interested in. For $9 they are okay for now but I will look for a better pair soon."
1.0,Never worn...broke when I took off the backing.  Will never buy again
1.0,"Just got it, it had a Stain on it"
1.0,Started getting white spots. Probably dried sweat. Tried washing it off and it doesn't work. Wish this didn't happen.
1.0,These were small and broken when received
1.0,Don’t buy ! Not like what they present in the description
1.0,"After being worn twice, the velcro detached from the strap making them unwearable unless I super glue them back together. For $70 I would have expected MUCH better quality and expected them to last the entire school year. Do not buy this shoe."
1.0,"The package came damaged, and the rings turn your fingers green after a few minutes. Not worth buying."
1.0,They did not meet my expectations. Really small.
1.0,Not like it seems
1.0,"These are an ""ok"" Vionic knock off. They are NOT true to size! I wear a 10, it said to buy my regular size. They didn't fit, they fit my daughter well and she is an 8.5. So, I would suggest to buy a larger size than what you wear. The front of them look a little weird, like they were cut wrong. I don't know if the arch support is good or not because I didn't walk in them. I wouldn't buy them again, I gave them to my daughter because I didn't want to deal with returning them. You get what you pay for I guess, these were less than 30 dollars, Vionics are usually 80 - 100 dollars."
1.0,"Very cheap quality, frame came off. Broke in pieces."
1.0,"Shirt is way small,  not true to size."
1.0,"I really wanted to love these sandals. They are very comfortable and great cushion support. First problem was that the first size I ordered was too small and when I went up a size, they weren’t just too big, it was like clown shoe big. I settled for the smaller size which I made work, but within a few weeks, they literally SHRANK. I left them outside on the porch where they were in the sun and the next morning, they had shrank so much my toes were hanging over the edge. The lip all around the side and front of the shoes were warped and peeled a part. Waste of money."
1.0,The bar is extremely wide for earlobes and looks stupid when you put them in
1.0,"To small, poorly made. I am currently in the USAF and have multiple helmet Bags. I accidentally lost a co-workers bag and tried to replace with the one I purchased becaused our bags are issued to us and I could not get another one at this time. I was so disappointed when this little no padding,  handles to close to the bag arrived. I was not able to fit our usual fight equipment in the bag.  It is just sitting in the garage and I explained to my commander what happened and he gave me a letter for a real helment bag. This bag is not quality,  it is small with no padding to protect your gear. Fellow military airmen, soldiers, marines and seamen don't purchase, it not military quality."
1.0,The bra is labeled as the wrong size. Like it says it is a D but is actually the size of a DD
1.0,I ordered size 8 and It is a little bit small than what size 8 should be on my daughter.<br />And the zipper did not work very good  because of the thin marital of the dress
1.0,"no, just no"
1.0,"I have never seen a more obvious waste of money. Unless, you buy them as a gag gift, you should really never be allowed to purchase anything again. For them to actually work well, they would need a lot of technology and wouldn't cost $10. Also, never buy anything that claims &#34;just pay separate shipping and handling&#34;. Red flag! Rip off. Please be careful and if you bought them, give me to your wacked out aunt for Christmas."
1.0,It is to tight and not worthy. Poor quality
1.0,"This hat came in a plastic bag and didn’t even have a crown support cardboard piece inside. Needless to say, it was totally ruined 😠. Thanks a lot!!"
1.0,3 of the pink diamonds were missing when I had received it ...quality sucks
1.0,Product was cheaply made and very flimsy.
1.0,"This dress is not at all as pictured. The cut, fit, and seams are terrible and awkward. I returned mine immediately."
1.0,This bag arrived with mildew on the interior of the bag...
1.0,It's a quarter of my hand. It's not a blouse. It's a top
1.0,The shoe(s) fit however I received two left shoes.  Wanted to send them back so error could be corrected however when I tried they were out of stock
1.0,"If quality or authenticity don't matter and you don't expect this to last more than a couple wash cycles this item is for you.<br />First of all, it says in the description that it is a sweatshirt. It is not. It would barely qualify as t-shirt material. The fabric is so thin it is practically see through. Not god when you purchase for your daughters.<br />Secondly, the workmanship is not even remotely good. The stitching is loose. The pocket on the only one we opened was sewn on crooked. There were threads sticking out in numerous places. There was bunches of different colored threads stuck to the shirts.<br />Finally, it is sold as Ivory Ella yet there are no tags - cloth or printed - at all on this garment. A sweatshop that makes knockoffs would not be willing to put their name on this.<br />I really don't understand how Amazon allows something like this to be sold on their website. We are currently trying  to get a refund. I will post back and let you know how that goes."
1.0,I don't know what I expected for this price.... the dress is almost completely and entirely sheer. See through.
1.0,This item is extremely cheaply made. The hem lines don’t even match in front.
1.0,"It didn't even look like this........it has blue all around the black and blue filling in spaces. You cannot tell what the design is on the shirt. Terrible. Looks like my 5 year old made the design on Microsoft paint, printed it out and ironed it on my shirt.  Wasted my money.  Thanks."
1.0,Not clip earrings!
1.0,Clips on the side need to be changed. Omg…… they eat your hair! Lol
1.0,I literally received this product at 11am THIS MORNING. It is 4. One has already fallen out of my ear and gone forever. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"The description on the length is a complete and outright lie. As seen in the pic the description says:<br /><br />Length: 11.6 inches (29.5cm) exclusive of buckle<br />Fit Wrist Length: Wrists from 6 1/4""(16cm) to 9 1/2""(24.5cm)<br /><br />The entire band 8.5"" not 11.5"" and definitely will NOT fit a 9.5"" wrist because the total length is 8.5"" and the first hole is 1-1/4"" from the end! Skip this mess and find an honest seller!!"
1.0,I received these today and they are no where close to being the color as pictured. They are a light almost yellow color and very cheaply made.
1.0,"Put it my Jacket and the first day I used it, it fell apart and I lost the pendant"
1.0,Terrible material sent it back
1.0,"The fit was on the small side, but mostly alright. However, the material is surprisingly thick and stiff--very uncomfortable--and it smells like rubber tires. I ended up returning it."
1.0,Good if you looking for a Halloween costume or one time use.  The material is very thin and flimsy. I thought about keeping and dying black for a Halloween costume but I returned it.
1.0,"Horrible product, not at all like pictured. Balled up in a plactic bag. ""Hat"" is crunched up beyond belief, cheap cut out felt. Not useable. I cannot describe how bad this is. I am a very crafty person & I cannot think of anyway to salvage this. I bought 2 seperate hats, both came as described above.  Requesting a return & refund."
1.0,They are really small! The earrings are a lot smaller then they appear in the pictures.
1.0,Purchased a 3xl was more like a XL - 2 xl . Way too small.
1.0,One fell off as I was getting the bus. I caught it in time. Not worth the money
1.0,"Quite confused as to why the set I ordered has 2 of the exact same shirts, and the pants are what were included. Please note. The set I ordered are supposed to have 2 different Dino shirts and I have 2 of the exact same."
1.0,"Piece of crap bought it in April , didn’t wear it July or August as I was off, wore it today whole band broke. I work for a school so watch doesn’t get abused at all."
1.0,"I bought it almost a year back, but we we started using now, it’s the worst product in quality. Entire umbrella shakes and move even in so little wind, and make cranking sound you can hear it from 200 ft.  All the part of the umbrella are so shaky, I even scared of using it when kids around. I wasted my money….. don’t recommend anyone. Stay away from this cheap quality."
1.0,"Very disappointed in the quality of these jeans. Completely not what I expected. I'm a medium, so I ordered a medium. The legs are longer than expected, with a slim fit, but the waist and zipper area are too big making the whole purchase a disappointment."
1.0,Did not work well at all on any 3 off my rings.  First one I used broke!
1.0,Junk! Not as pictured! Very fragile broke within a hour of wearing it. Waste of money
1.0,"If I could give these things a negative 10, I would.  They looked like something someone fished out of a toilet.<br />Filthy!"
1.0,This is good it is just too expensive.
1.0,Received defect product with missing stone. Complete waste of money. I brought this for my wife. Now she hates it
1.0,"Son hermosas pero la parte d arriba es demasiado estrecha por lo que a la niña le hace difícil entrar el piececito entero. No la recomiendo, ni otros modelos similares."
1.0,I dislike the size. It should be smaller with a S/P description.
1.0,The socks were shorter than in photo.
1.0,The flannel looks nothing like the picture. I ordered it for the blue color. Has a ugly yellow color. So disappointed. This isnt the first time its happened BEWARE
1.0,"I have this dress in other colors and I love them, but when this one came the fabric was terrible."
1.0,Horrible quality and horrible customer service.
1.0,"I am petite, but I was swimming in this dress. Return process was great."
1.0,"Do not buy! Not a ring at all! It's triangle shaped, not round like a ring. Totally useless and going in garbage!"
1.0,"Looks so pretty! However, had an allergic reaction to the metal. Which made my new piercing blister up, inflamed with pus and blood. The metal tarnished! Now I'm going through the process of healing the womb, which is quite painful and displeasing to the eye!"
1.0,It's not what it says def not worth the money it's junk
1.0,"I don’t like the quality of this jacket, made of very cheap fabric, and no pockets too. I am going return this jacket."
1.0,Cheat material
1.0,Looks nice in the picture but the item was way overpriced for the quality you get. No item details in the listing. Seller gave a small partial refund to keep the item as returning it would be “cumbersome”. Waste of money
1.0,"I wanted something that would ""pin"" through a cloak or sweater.  These don't have enough of a point on the pin part to do that."
1.0,Small piece fell off immediately and bracelet turned green
1.0,They broke first time trying to put them in.  Do not purchase.
1.0,Broke as soon as I opened the package
1.0,"Not only were the shoulder pads visible, but they were slickly crooked. Overall pretty unflattering and cheaply made"
1.0,"The material is see through for the pink. It is super tight at the top, and the straps are more at the collar bone than hanging on your shoulders. It balloons out and is way too short. I’m only 5’4” and it barely covered my belly button.<br />It says you can return, which is technically true but extremely misleading. They have to approve your return, you pay for postage, and they deduct 30%.<br />I will not be using this company ever again. Not a quality shirt, not as described, horrible return process."
1.0,"I was very hesitant to purchase TDEZ2070-C Nickel Free 8mm Round Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Post Friction at first but I thought my risk was very minimal because of the price.  I am soooo glad I didn't pay more than $6.99.  I have a very sensitive skin and these were so painful to wear!  Also, the backing is so small and flimsy that it felt like I was crushing it while putting these on! These aren't worth buying even for that price."
1.0,Este producto nunca llego
1.0,"When you make a thong bikini the back suppose to be smaller than the front, they fit at the front but rediculos from the back , the top made for baby , idk maby if I was a man it would fit..."
1.0,Shirt was great...pants were a mess!
1.0,Wrist band too small - Can't wear it.
1.0,I got what I paid for I guess. I had to cut the end seam for it to fit on the glasses and when it was on the thing was twisted.
1.0,"Way too short and small, maybe good as ankle warmer only,<br />.Very cheap,feeling"
1.0,The WORST material I’ve ever seen. Nothing like the picture shown. Do not order and do not trust. Was over two weeks late and the poorest quality I’ve ever seen. you could never workout in this
1.0,"I loved the design and feel of this shirt. But after one washing, the neck stretched way out for no reason. Now it looks like I've worn this shirt for years or something, and I cannot wear it out in public."
1.0,"super cute, but super huge all over as well.  I am 5'10&#34; and 130 lbs.  Based on other reviews, I ordered up in sizing. I thought a large would work more like a small-medium.  The dress was a tent!  I am returning it and already ordered it off of another seller in what they claim will be a US size 6.  The dress is &#34;swingy&#34;.  I prefer a belt, cream leggings and tall riding boots.  Hoping the next size will work."
1.0,Got the dark purple twice came back light purple both times I will buy my dress from somewhere.
1.0,Suppose to be a XXL Not even close to right size and very poor quality. What a waste of money.
1.0,I SENT IT BACK TOO SMALL.
1.0,Got broken the second day I wore it. I didn’t see any medical benefits but it looks nice as a jewelry
1.0,"The actual product does not resemble the photo at all, which looks to be of woven fabric. It's pure cheap polyester."
1.0,Terrible do not buy
1.0,"Feels like costume material, looks incredibly cheap"
1.0,My daughter wore the shoes once and now only the back half of both shoes work. ? I don't understand how both shoes only the back half work same number of lights on each .
1.0,The quality of the product is low the material and above all the termination
1.0,Beware - these run super small! The model in the photo is tiny! Definitely doesn't stretch to a 44 inch waist as it says!
1.0,Terrible no detail can see what its alleged to be
1.0,"After waiting over a month for these, I received a children's sized pair of bright orange capri leggings. So disappointing."
1.0,"Terrible!!!! When they first came they were ok....almost as long as I'd wanted, but as soon as I WASHED them only (no dryer) they shrunk to a laughable degree!! Seriously wouldn't fit a small child at that point. Such a waste."
1.0,Quality not good at all
1.0,"Was so excited to give these as gifts. However, although probably pretty warm, they are way too small for most adults and had to return them."
1.0,I didn’t like how stiff the plastic is and how it feels so cheap.
1.0,"Do not buy, not worth the money. Too big for my face"
1.0,These Mcleese Flare Leggings for women aren't the greatest.  I don't really care for the material as it is very thin (nylon) and see through.  They are as described high waisted and crossover flares.  They came with a leopard print headband.  If you are looking for this particular material and design these are perfect for you.
1.0,"I was actually sent two different kinds of socks as a pair, in the same package. As you can see in the photos, they are different sizes as well as different colors."
1.0,The cheapest pants from China you can get
1.0,The right eye piece white cover was cut. So I sent it back.
1.0,Part of the watch band snapped off the first time I tried to adjust it. This isn't covered under the warranty. You get what you pay for. Don't buy this watch.
1.0,"I returned these, they are cheaply made and I felt as though it would break if I pulled it forward to put a bead into it."
1.0,"Cut of dress is strange so it lays awkward, especially the pockets"
1.0,it is not easy on easy off as advertised
1.0,"I was expecting a thick, heavy fleece, but this is no more than a light shirt with a thin fleece lining. Runs a tad small too."
1.0,The band was very stiff and uncomfortable. It also cracked within a few days. I returned the item.
1.0,They fell apart apart after 2 weeks. I was disappointed because they looked good.
1.0,Whenever I move my wrist it becomes unclasped
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these masks back in April for my 2 yr old and 10 year old. They are great quality and I like that they come with a filter that can be changed as well. My daughters love their masks. However I have to mention that shipping and recieving the masks takes forever!! I purchased in April but, did not receive the 2 masks until the middle of July. They do ship from China."
1.0,"Muy pequeña!!!! ni a mi hija le sirvió.  Entiendo que no es normal el tamaño y para colmo no abre por ningún lado . Mide 16cm apróximamente,  imposible que mi mano entre! Muy bonita , pero nada útil en el tamaño y sobre todo deben ponerle un gancho que permita abrirla."
1.0,"I really liked these slipper socks. They were warm and very comfortable. However, only after wearing them twice the seam on the sole started unraveling. So unfortunate and my window to return has closed."
1.0,"I ordered this in white, it was 2 sizes too small despite ordering by bust size and the fabric was so thin it's nearly transparent. I've ordered the same dress in other colors from both this seller and others and never had a problem before so I'm not sure what happened with this one but I was really disappointed :("
1.0,After having this watch for less than a month the bezel has fallen off and we have lost it.  It was being worn about 3 to 4 times a week and in very normal conditions.
1.0,Too quiet and one hand fell off the first day. Sent it back.
1.0,Tarnish
1.0,Cool idea but the clasp broke before I even put it on
1.0,I brought my shirt in to be dry cleaned and the blue colors faded into the white and they tried to fix it but couldn't and now the shirt is ruined and I am out $50.00 I bought 3 of these shirts from you but this will be the last. How do I get a refund?
1.0,"I usually wear a size large in womens so ordered the large. Granted, I am short so knew it would be a little long but it was hanging so low past my crotch- if I had gone down a size I think this still would have been an issue. And the Joey pocket and Joey are a joke. The pocket is so shallow and slopes down at your crotch. And the Joey is a huge stuffed animal. Even if this fit me properly the Joey would never stay in. Not to mention the Joey has its own pouch, which anatomically speaking is dumb. And it’s a different color than the costume. Also the face on the hood looks like a puppy dog and nothing like a real kangaroo. Overall just a horrible costume. There are better and cuter and cheaper kangaroo costumes out there."
1.0,"This belt was too small and felt like it wouldn't last very long. It was too glittery for our taste and for dress code, so returning."
1.0,No way shape or form would this fit my Amzfit 5.  I asked for a refund and received one.  I really wanted the bracelet.
1.0,Loved the suit when it arrived. I bought it for my 28 year old daughter. She absolutely loved it. Wore it once and the zipper broke. Sad
1.0,Its a waste!
1.0,Bad ugly not at all like<br />The photo so thick and cheap so big and bad for
1.0,"Cheap, plastic feeling, The one with the chain broke before anyone ever even wore it.  Costume stuff, not real bike leather type stuff."
1.0,"The product itself is terrific, however, im giving 1 star because there was one if the bracelets in the pack and when I contacted the company to let them know, there was and still has been noreply. Very bad business."
1.0,There is a large seam running straight down the front and the back of the dress instead of the sides. It's very distracting and doesn't look very flattering.
1.0,Broke within 3 days. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,I bought this item in July this year but clip just broke down mysteriously.
1.0,Broke when I tried it on. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
1.0,Got a 3x. it would be a tight for for a 1x if you could get it on at all. Of course you want it tight to be effective but this is not made for plus size people at all.
1.0,My daughter is 8yrs old and wears size 12. I read they ran small so i ordered size16 and they were too small and a button came off soon as we opened the package. Im returning them
1.0,It came with a hole in the side of the glove. Yikes!
1.0,Where to begin.I read the size chart and description.And ordered .The description of the dress clearly says diamond. Straps The picture of the dress shows rhinestones.I never expected actual diamond's but expected at least the dress pictures.I received a dress with material badly sewn.Ball bead's for straps.And gaps in the dress stitching.Very noticeable.Why I did provide pictures for buyer's.The dress is made very shabby.But on a plus note the material is very nice.Not even worth sending it back.
1.0,"horrible quality, fit and design!"
1.0,short is too small and shirt is too big
1.0,"Fabric is very thin. But the real problem was that it looks like a bathrobe. Maybe it was just my figure, but it’s not the least bit flattering. Sizing was fine if you follow the size chart."
1.0,Umbrellas were too small . Needed them for a wedding ...bride was very upset<br />Not like online illustration<br />very disappointed after so much waiting for nothing<br />Please update your pictures online<br />I RETURNED BOTH ITEMS<br />STILL WAITING ON MY CREDIT
1.0,"First wear, ruined."
1.0,I sent it back.  Piece of junk!
1.0,Very cheaply made. Falls apart easily.
1.0,It was the size of Barbie clothes and nothing like the pic
1.0,I suppose if you’re a baby it would be great. I lost it off my charm bracelet the first day. So tiny I never did find it. Advertised for children AND ADULTS
1.0,"Terrible quality, arrived late, look like the design was ironed on"
1.0,The shoes were too small for me.  I wear a mens 10.5.  They were both too small and too narrow.  Perhaps they should be only marketed for women.
1.0,Never got items
1.0,Don't waste your time or money. Broke or bent before I even put them on. Very disappointed.
1.0,Came in with the print coming off of the side of the pad already :/ I have to glue it back on
1.0,Box is decent but empty LOL!
1.0,Loved the type and color of the earrings but they are tiny. Ordered the biggest ones. Not worth sending back.
1.0,Es muy mala calidad de tela
1.0,"Shaped like a box. Shrunk on first wash two sizes, very short and boxy. I have a short torso and it wouldn’t even work for me. This pink color is also almost highlighter pink, which is a dead give away that it’s cheap and definitely not linen."
1.0,Super thin... tight in the arms.
1.0,Looks like a rusted piece of tiny crap that would not even come close to fitting in my nose waste of money
1.0,"Buttons came off immediately, cheap fabric and stitching, and sizing was small. Save your mi eu and buy local."
1.0,They suck.
1.0,Fell apart quickly. Cheap.
1.0,Horrible experience
1.0,The lip is huge and the diameter is quite a bit larger than 38mm..
1.0,"Broke the very first day, honestly I took it our of the package and placed it on my wrist, I mean oops, picked it up all over my floor"
1.0,"I am 115lbs, 5'4. Purchased XS but it fit like my husband's XL t-shirts. Returned."
1.0,Did not look the same as pic
1.0,I returned this immediately! The material was cheap and didn’t hold shape at all.
1.0,These glasses are a joke.  The lens do not even fit in the frame.  They are too big and are screwed into the top.  And the side of the lens don't even wrap around far enough.  Don't waste you money.
1.0,These pants are sheer. I don't mean just a little thin. I could see my underwear clearly. I might as well just wear tights! You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Pattern was definitely different from the picture. Material is very thin and very cheap, there is absolutely no give, as well. But the sizing is very small."
1.0,Stitches were loose.  Arm holes too tight in the armpits... but looses everywhere else.
1.0,"Wow its unbelievably tiny.  I just opened the package and I laughed when I saw how little it is.  I had to struggle to get it on my small ear and now it's sore.  I can tell this will only be worn once because it will fall off and be lost.  This cuff should be in children's jewelry.  I'm super disappointed with this cuff, I was really looking forward to getting it now that they're in style again.  If you have really small ears then you'll love it."
1.0,Came damaged just like the other reviews. Cheap quality and it shows. Packaged well so it comes down to quality. Definitely over priced!
1.0,Bought a size bigger than I usually wear. Doubt these will fit anyone above size 10 in the US.
1.0,Very disappointed....this jacket is not warm at all.  I was expecting it to be warm base on the reviews.  It could not even manage the office air conditioning
1.0,"Product not as pictured, this is a waist length cover not full as shown in picture"
1.0,"The umbrella arrived damaged with a 1”x2” tear right in the center of one of the panels. The tear is hidden inside when the umbrella is closed down, not a tear caused by shipping. Also the LED lights do not work."
1.0,"I have a size 34 inch waist and I bought the largest pair, and it seems like these are manufactured for women too small and no room for your manhood"
1.0,"This was bought as a gift for my dad, removed the item from the package and unsnapped the button up top and it pulled right through the shirt leaving a hole. He said don’t worry about it I won’t button it that high anyway but the point is this shirt was cheaply made and not a good purchase."
1.0,"Poorly made. I bought two of these hoodies one for my 10yr old and it was good. Quality of this sweater was poor front zipper was broken and would not zip when I did manage to zip it, it would pop on open ."
1.0,The shield is too big. It hangs down to the top of your chest. I don’t like it.
1.0,Can not breath with this material very hot and cleangy
1.0,It looked like cut glass with no facets to give it any shine or sparkle. Returned it.
1.0,"The padding is great, but there is some stiff plastic at the back of the shoe that digs into my ankle above the heel. Uncomfortable and painful."
1.0,Ordered bigger size and still was to small I was disappointed it was my after wedding outfit I love sweats and we all were supposed to wear the same colors and I didn’t look the same
1.0,This was a Christmas gift and quite disappointing. The clasp would not close once opened. It was nearly impossible to get the clasp open and it is so small it really should not be advertised as a woman’s bracelet. It is for a child really. I will be returning it. I always considered Pandora to be a quality product. This fell far short.
1.0,No me gusto nada
1.0,Too bright of a blue. It's not dark navy like the picture. Runs big.
1.0,I only received two of them and i paid for package of four and I just received because I have too ship it to my country I’m very disappointed.
1.0,Turned skin green and necklace itself started to turn brassy
1.0,"This was not a quality product, fit horribly, returning."
1.0,This was definitely a shirt. There is no way this could be considered a dress.
1.0,Super cheap  Material  . I  returned this
1.0,This is a piece of junk product.  Does not work.  I can pick up the balls with my naked eye better without this monstrosity.  Additionally it was advertised as something I can wear over my prescription glasses.  Not true.<br /><br />Additionally I am trying to return the product and the seller is requesting me to pay for returns to Canada.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product or buy any products from this seller.
1.0,"I bought three of these shirts. First one they sent me a size bigger than what I ordered. I ended up liking how loose it was. I bought 2 more of the size that was sent to me. They sent the correct size but when I washed and dried them they shrank to half the size of the original. I washed and dried the first with no issue more than once. It was disappointing.<br /><br />Update:So I thought  that the second pair I bought shrunk from throwing them in the wash because that’s what I automatically do, but turns out they were labeled the same size but they were 2 different sizes. I had bout another thinking I wouldn’t dry it and it would be ok, but unfortunately that was not the case. Very disappointed"
1.0,Okay first off this dress looks absolutely nothing like the picture And the fabric is weird. Not excited.
1.0,I’m 5 6ft the dress barely came to my ankles . Dress was not flattering at all.
1.0,Material felt like thin paper (not soft) and the babydoll pleating doesn’t extent to the back of the shirt like I had assumed it would (just flat). Looks weird on. Won’t be wearing.
1.0,This skirt is very hard to zip up due to not having a hook and eye. It’s also a struggle to zip where the skirt meets the waistband because of how poorly it’s sewn. The skirt ripped at that point before I could even finish zipping it. As a whole it’s poorly constructed from cheap fabric. Beware it also has slits and runs rather small. I almost wonder if I even received the same skirt as some of the 5 Star reviews.
1.0,Too small in the gut(even for an average size person) while being way too lose in the shoulder where it matters...
1.0,"The strap broke the very first time I wore it :( I was very disappointed because otherwise, I thought it was perfect. Definitely will return."
1.0,"I don't know what to say about this, but it's a clown suit is disguise!! Unflattering!!"
1.0,"It came early so that was awesome! But the red Love Yourself logo is way off to the side (like more than it should be) so it’s obstructed from view when casually wearing it. My BIGGEST complaint is the fact I washed it once in cold water and when I took it out, the logo on the back started peeling. I’ll admit this is a way better price than the original but I’m really upset with the one I received:/"
1.0,"The picture turned out okay but this won’t work for my daughter to take her glasses to school. It’s simply a neoprene case, not hard shell as advertised."
1.0,"I received this with a missing stone found loose in the bag.  So what makes me think the rest are going to stay in?  I ordered 4 pieces of this Steve Madden line of jewelry, and 3 of the four arrived with a missing stone.  On top of that the arrangement of the colors was done in a weird non-symetrical way that just looks like a child did it."
1.0,"The shirt was WAY too small! I think it's made for kids. I'm an adult large and purchased large. I checked to make sure it was an adult shirt, it says it is. Gave it to a relative who's in jr high and it fit perfect on her."
1.0,I ordered the correct size for my child. Product arrived in a timely manner but was way too small. I recommend going up in size.
1.0,"No, I do not like the Bling Guard"
1.0,"Product runs small, quality not as expected!"
1.0,It was broken when we got it
1.0,"Terrible material, uncomfortable. Feels cheap.<br />The hat is smaller than the size they say it is."
1.0,"To small for me, I am a big breast person"
1.0,"Am a petite short girl with 4.11ft and 146 lbs and THIS item has a wrong description!! THIS DRESS is made with a ROUGH chunky CHEAP fabric see my pics!! Be aware of what you see on pictures! Ladies, this dress is more for a “11 yrs old SKINNY TEENAGER GIRL” NOT for WOMAN with a 36C bra, with 4.11 ft with a 146 lbs. Even gotten the Large size I couldn’t fit in this tinny dress. Plus fabric is SO cheaply made. Am reviewing this bcz I don’t want any amazon customer to go through what am going now, I contacted the seller 4 th times through amazon, and just because I didn’t accept the seller offer, in “to keep the item and get part of the money back” I have to go through the process to return it and will costly more than I pay for this dress. Am saving you a headache, but if you wanna take a RISK go ahead! As I said this LARGE size tinny dress is more for a “11 yrs old skinny teenager”. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS CHEAP FABRIC TO ANYONE!!"
1.0,"I bought this and thought it would be great, love the color but it has no life in it just sages and the color doesn't stand up as in the picture.  Just a poorly put together piece."
1.0,Not what I expected at all. I thought it would be made out of sweatshirt type material and instead it's shiny like a bowling jacket and soooooo Thin! Definitely more of spring time jacket
1.0,The large was for small...was very tight!
1.0,2XX…Too small  More like a medium
1.0,"Too small, fits perfectly for a child"
1.0,"This leotard is WAY TOO SMALL, no way is it youth 12/14, it is more like a child size 5/6!"
1.0,"small, does not correspond to its size, the photo does not correspond to reality"
1.0,I didn't like the fit & the fabric of the dress
1.0,"cheap swimsuit, the wires were poking out and hurt!"
1.0,"Definetly not waterproof. The very first time it got wet, it stopped working. I put it in a bag of rice and it only came back half way"
1.0,Came wripped
1.0,My items came all stuck together. I can’t separate them. Had to send them back.
1.0,"Overall, bathing suit looks cheap. Bottoms are sooooo ugly. That little hole at the belly button looks so awkward in person. doesn't fit right at all!"
1.0,"The dress was much too tight around my arms, which are average."
1.0,"I ordered the heart shaped rose quartz earrings and I've never been so disappointed. They're absolutely huge, gaudy and don't even resemble rose quartz. The free roll on is nothing but stones in a roll on dispenser. There's no liquid in it and didn't come with any instructions. I'll never order from this company again."
1.0,The dress fit about 2 sizes too small. The quality for the price was perfect!
1.0,"These pants fit very poorly... not much stretch to them at all and they're loose in all the wrong places, but short on my legs at the same time."
1.0,Cotton blend....NO. Polyester shiny. Picture makes it look like T-shirt.  Not even close
1.0,So you cannot wear this mask by itself. You have to wear a mask under it. I guess it’s cool for what it is.
1.0,It change too soon
1.0,The jacket says Pink Satin Ladies.
1.0,Very dissatisfied. Scratched on first day blocking view of time
1.0,ITEM ARRIVED SMELLING STRONGLY OF BODY ODOR AND SWEAT.  AWFUL AND COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.  SICKENING!  CLEARLY HAS BEEN WORN BEFORE.
1.0,too small and not sewn square ..........  also has an odd smell ...  badly wrinkled<br /><br />will be returning this
1.0,$1700 for a grill and they can't even include the $19 propane hose and connector.  Do not do business with 247!
1.0,Not linen as advertised. No linen at all. Tag says 100% cotton but it isn't. Pockets are polyester and some of the lowest quality I've ever seen. Main fabric is probably all poly but might be a blend. Seriously. They're useless.
1.0,Not was shown (pictue)
1.0,A gift  and the battery  was dead  make sure  the battery  is working . The price is right
1.0,I normally wear a 3X so I ordered this dress 2 sizes up and it was still way to small !! Instead of going through the red tape of returning it I gave it to a friend that wears maybe a XL and it fit her perfectly.
1.0,"I got the Khaki color. Material is super thin, OK.<br />If you sweat at all it turns very dark and almost transparent! Extremely unsightly!"
1.0,Larger than expected.  Not as shiny as they look.
1.0,It’s a nice jacket. Soft and cool looking. But unfortunately 2X too snug around the top part of my arms. I can just barely close the buttons. I Don’t have a printer to print label to send back. So my loss will never order from them again.
1.0,"they were so small and did not work.  couldn't even get them on. thru them away,"
1.0,"Just made a cross country international trip and needless to say-my luggage did not hold up well. My middle sized suitcase has a huge dent on the sides (I'm guessing from rough handling at the airport) Both coming and going, with locks in place-my suitcases were opened on the bag belt!!!!! My clothes were hanging outside of my BAG!!! Locks were very faulty and easily accessible. In addition, the plastic that covers the luggage should be removed prior to usage. Its not a protectant and by time its used once-it will look horrible."
1.0,Pretty shapeless.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed! WTF does ""women men"" mean? Well what it doesn't mean is: ""this is for for men."""
1.0,Very Bad quality🤨
1.0,Horrible material and does not look like the picture. It cost 35$ but feels and looks like it’s $2.00 I would stay away
1.0,"I put it in the trash,the material is a cry for help"
1.0,They don't look clean will never recommended to buy from them
1.0,The pendant broke with the first wear.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Ripped after one wear.
1.0,"Look at the other critical reviews, they are all completely correct. Plastic lenses do not focus well and have glare, very uncomfortable plastic frames hurt your nose and temples. Item arrived was  obviously used/returned-imagine that."
1.0,Was not what I expected. To long to tight.
1.0,I purchased this item a few years ago and loved it so I selected the item from my order history and ordered the same size again after I stained my previous one. This time the dress was much smaller and had a strange sewing error on the side that caused it to jut out at an angle on the side of the shirt. I wear this tied with a cardigan over so it wasn't a huge deal to me but I wore my previous one year round because it was sewn correctly. I could not do that with this one.
1.0,Terrible product! No way this is one size fits all! Super teeny tiny waste
1.0,Really hard to clean
1.0,Pilled and faded after 1st wash. Threw them away. Waste of money!!
1.0,I ordered a medium and it fits like an XXL. It's one thing to have something fit small or large but this is like a dress.
1.0,Edges get black after an hour of normal use.
1.0,"To small, too short.  Will not wear."
1.0,"The worst nursing tops ever, don't waste your money on this. They don't stay in place, the bottom of the top it's lways rolling up."
1.0,It is horrible material and it’s not tye dye.
1.0,"I was trying to save some money.  This is case-and-point where that is a bad idea.  After one wash, they all shrunk and a few of them started forming holes in the seams.<br />Spend the extra, go with Fruit of the Loom: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VTV8ISK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
1.0,Y’all gave me a fake hat that says 9fifty on the sticker and 9forty in the inside....
1.0,Horrible didn’t even fit my brothers girlfriend and she’s tiny :/
1.0,Its more like a size small
1.0,Not all of that
1.0,"The bottoms are way too big, and top way too small."
1.0,Lasted a good 2 weeks before it broke
1.0,Un producto pésimo
1.0,At first was excited when package arrived.  Once I opened it I immediately Italy began to is to see how the is how the Fur began to shed all over the place.. I then begin to try it on I could barely get my head in through the suit it was so tight then the shoe covers wouldn't even fit over the shoes Then the gloves gloves wouldn't even fit on my hand my hand so I figured Maybe I need to order another size. Well I ordered a different size and sent the 1st one back when I received the 2nd 1 in a larger size it was the same exact problem. Plus on the 2nd one the boot covers were not included . I just ended up sending it all back and I ordered another suit ordered another suit was a little bit more expensive but better quality and much better fit.
1.0,Poorly manufactured should not cost more then $2.99 period!
1.0,These were thin with little support. They also had some logo on it which would show through if worn as an undershirt. Skip these
1.0,I bought it for my 10 year old granddaughter and it was waaaayyy too small.
1.0,"Colour changed by the end of the day, had to through it away, bought it before my daughter was born, kept it until she could wear it, but only got a day from it."
1.0,I loved these earrings. Unfortunately they were broke when arrived. I had to return
1.0,Cheap print size way small
1.0,"This is not a plus size top. You cannot trust sizes on Amazon. This is the second top from China in a couple weeks. Unless the size chart is comparable to US sizing,  stay away."
1.0,"fits like a sack, did not come in the color I wanted.  would not recommend"
1.0,Very cheap looking jewelry.  Price is not worth returning otherwise I would have returned it.
1.0,"I received this watch for my granddaughter today. She was so excited. However, when she went to put it on for the very first time the strap fell off in her hand. I am returning it and will not buy another one. We were both very disappointed."
1.0,"The pajama body fits the kid's body, but the footies are just way too small. Now it's true that the kid has wide flipper-feet (this is good - he swims very well), but he's not a duck or a mutant. The feet are too small and the cost of returning makes it not worthwhile. Donating them and hoping they find someone with skinny feet.<br /><br />Disappointed."
1.0,It was to big for my daughter but very good quality
1.0,"The dress is very thin, and seems to be sewn wrong in the chest area. It would fit otherwise, but seems to be sewn incorrectly. The print is lovely, and I like the color. I wish I would have known there was a time limit on returns."
1.0,It was lopsided and it was like they didn't know how the garment was supposed to look. The absolute worst. Came from Asia so you can't send it back
1.0,"I am 5'6"" at 160 lbs and ordered a Large.  The bottoms were too snug and the top was too large.  The sleeves are so long they go past my fingertips. The fabric was soft and cozy."
1.0,Item came broken and is very cheap plastic. It doesn’t even come with a strap to keep on face.
1.0,"Faker!! Warning complete junk, the red peeling off just got it. Brought to pandora & it’s a fake! I’m very angry, will file an A-Z.. Buyer beware!! Horrible replica."
1.0,"Literally just put them on for the first time, and they have a hole."
1.0,This jumpsuit came folded in a pouch that would hold a handkerchief and is about the weight of one. It is very poor quality.
1.0,"Like the fit,  just a little thinner than expected though, I'm a woman,  but unfortunately being that they are made for a man they have extra material already prepared for a mans extra body parts.......can't even make them work for me.  They must go back"
1.0,"I was so excited to order this dress based on the reviews and photos. When this dress arrived, it was 2 times too big. I ordered a small but instead got an XL or 2XL.🤔. Very disappointed.  Thankfully i wasn't relying on that dress for a special occasion."
1.0,Garbage masks. Super thin and looks like they were spray painted. Company out of China expects me to return ship to China (although my shipping package says shipped from CA). Shipping wrap ok but masks (50 count) were stuffed individually into packaging. Ummm...no thanks.
1.0,"Fell apart already, nice"
1.0,To small for it to be a large im a M and thought ill get a bigger size and nope it was smaller than a normal M
1.0,"the silicone hook splits about a day of use. basically was worthless for 10 pairs, last me a week."
1.0,"Bottom fit perfect, top was three sizes too small."
1.0,These shorts came in much bigger than the size I ordered which was about a 33.  The pants I received were at least a 36 in the waist.
1.0,Great to work with but product sucks
1.0,Please send size 2X vest ASAP rec’d medium too small for me
1.0,These are not tummy control these are junk their paper-thin they are a piece of crap I'm sending them back
1.0,"this bag was extremely off-centered, as the photo shows. I have ordered several bags within the past two months from this company (6 in total, I think -4 as gifts, 1 in the background of the second picture) and I LOVED them! Therefore, I was highly disappointed to see this bag. Symmetrically, it is all wrong and as with the other, the straps aren't long enough to be worn on my shoulder. I felt really confident that I would be able to speak to someone regarding this matter, especially with the card enclosed with the bag, which was why I held off writing a review.  However, after numerous failed attempts at reaching a rep, I decided to give my review to let my fellow Amazonians know that THIS bag will forever sit on my closet shelf and I'm not sure I will be patronizing this company again for this type of material"
1.0,MADE IN CHINA!
1.0,"Ordered Child sized for my 5 year old, neither in the package will stretch to fit over his head in order to wear.<br /><br />(submitted for refund)"
1.0,I was really excited about this wrap but i m disappointed because it sheds fuzz all over my black shirt and pants. Now i don't even want to wear it.
1.0,Too small but too late to return I gave it away
1.0,"Bought these Jan 10th, my son just used them for the first time yesterday Feb 10. One of the gloves is ripped on the seam. Return date was Feb 9th! Now we're stuck with defective gloves. Very disappointing! Expensive gloves, poor quality."
1.0,"I bought this as a gift.  It was so not like the photo, and unattractive, I had to return it.  The recipient would have thought I hated her."
1.0,extremely cheap material and it had a terrible odor!!!!
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Would not recommend
1.0,"When I ordered the product there were no sizes, S, M, L, etc.  What arrived doesn't feel like an adult size frame.  The clips that hold the framr to the mask are super flimsy and don't latch on at all.  It is a soft plastic which would be nice if all I had to worry about was it touching my skin.  It's also small and doesn't cover the area I need it to cover very well.  Sorry, this isn't for me. I will be returning it.<br />UPDATE:. I have been attempting to return this product for several days. The item description says ""Free Returns"" however the label provided requires me to pay postage.  When I messaged the seller they offered to give me half refund and I keep the product. I told them I would not accept that. They issued a full refund of the purchase price but are still expecting me to pay return shipping fees.  I have never experienced such a hassle.  PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER WITH CAUTION  IF YOU THINK THERE IS A CHANCE YOU MAY WANT TO RETURN THE ITEM."
1.0,Material is see through and I ordered navy.
1.0,This sweater does not lay right.  The buttons down the back bunch up & the strap behind the neck is very annoying.  Returned!
1.0,"This coverup is not at all true to size. It’s at least 2 sizes smaller than stated, maybe 3. I returned it."
1.0,The fit was awful. It does not look or fit like the image. Very deceiving. I would but.
1.0,"the plastic parts breaks within few use...poor quality, made to break easy.....waist of money"
1.0,way smaller than what I expected but also lacks support
1.0,"I thought the jacket was very attractive. The quality is pretty nice. However, I don't think it should ever pop up when you search plus size leather jacket. I can only imagine what the small fits. Maybe a doll. I selected the 2x because I know things coming from China run small. I  usually wear a large jacket. Maybe a 10. So I selected 2 sizes up for it to look and fit lime a medium or small. I couldn't even get my arm in the sleeve. I recommend this for very small ladies or maybe kids since they are pretty up and down slim. Definitely not a plus size jacket."
1.0,"Wish I could give zero stars! The top is ok, not great but ok, but the pants are terrible! Craftsmanship is poor, bad stitching, way too small (I know my size and these were not true to size) and believe it or not one leg was an inch and a half longer than the other! I'll keep the top but am donating the pants."
1.0,Looks cheap. Not worth it.
1.0,"I received the agate defect, I returned and they're Charge the shipment to my account."
1.0,This item really does suck it comes apart
1.0,"Esta cadena la compré con mucha ilusión, pero la dejé de usar por un tiempo y cuando traté de usarla de nuevo estabade color negro traté de limpiarla se limpio pero al otro día amaneció asi negro dorada, Así que estoy desilusionada con esta compra!"
1.0,Snapped in half right after we opened thepackage. Poor plastic quality.
1.0,"Purchased for my future daughter in law for one of her friends. Ordered the largest size and upon receiving and opening it, we both looked at it and it looked like a large maybe an xl. I know manufacturing clothes, each company fits everyone different, but this dress was way off on size. The tag is correct at least by the 3xl tag. Very disappointed."
1.0,"This top would be cute WITHOUT the ""knot"" I'm not sure wtf is going on in that area but its definitely not as pictured. Ugh. The fabric feels nice and the print is pretty but the so called knot is horrible. It looks like they cut a piece of fabric and patched it there with very visible stitching and just looped it through to where it sits inside out. Hopefully you can see for yourself in the pic. I definitely wouldn't purchase again and would be returning if I didn't have to pay for shipping. Also- I followed the chart and sized up accordingly and it's still fitted, not loose like the photo."
1.0,Wore these glasses for 4 days and they fell completely apart. Quite disappointed because I really liked the style.
1.0,Not as Brite as should be like no pic
1.0,Child size horrible
1.0,Me salió defectuoso.. La fecha se adelanta 2 unidades al dia
1.0,The clasp mechanism is poor quality and easily becomes loose.
1.0,"Horrible quality the black looks shinny like a garbage bag, material is thin, waste of money"
1.0,earring arrived unattached from hook
1.0,"Defective. Arrived missing 3 of the grommet details. Otherwise, it would have been a great purse."
1.0,Both don’t fit to small
1.0,Too did not fit and bottoms bearly fit
1.0,Only giving it 1 star bc I have to. It's super cheap material. !!!!
1.0,"I ordered the rainbow look but got the dark black ones.  They totally don't fit unless you have a very flat nose, and I don't.  They come with some nice extras but are made very cheaply."
1.0,"Material thin, no waist band, unless you use body tape this piece of scrap won't even stay on you"
1.0,It broke off just taking it out!
1.0,The jacket look really cute on. However my son has been using for less than two weeks and it has a big hole on the side.
1.0,Garbage. It bent the first time I wore it. It was jagged and sliced into my finger.
1.0,"I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I ordered 3, knowing I could get 3 of the same color or pattern, but I got 3 white!! I didn't know white was a possiblity. Plus, they are very very small. So Disappointed."
1.0,"Ridiculous cost for the rather “cheap” fabric used! I could’ve sewn something together for way less, better material, and the fact that I don’t really sew, which says a lot! Also, it took 1.5 months to get here from ONE State over! For the “shipping” charge to be that big, it shouldn’t be in regular envelope and should HAVE had a priority postage on it! Ridiculous! You’re better off cutting a pillowcase & sewing one side- to “fit”!"
1.0,The picture is very deceiving- THIS IS NOT A WRAP. I wear a size 4 and am unable to wrap it at all. It is truly just a shoulder shrug. If that's what you are looking for then this is a good one but DO NOT think you can wrap it as shown in the picture.
1.0,Most of these broke the 1st time I took them on
1.0,I gave custome measurements and paid for express delivery and got fast delivery but now way was dress fit to measurements. Now my wedding is only 9 days away with a dress that is to big. I kept telling I was not a size 14 and I am only 5'1/2 ft. Tall. Way to big and long.
1.0,"I've tried these several times, they get stuck & make it difficult to remove. They also tear easily & are extremely long."
1.0,"It read that it was a fit over, but with the nose piese it has there is no way it can work as a fit over"
1.0,This only got 1 star because I didn’t have no star option!! This was beyond horrible ordered a 3x & it came in size small marked as 3x the wire popped right out during trying on! My daughter is a size l or xl and she couldn’t even fit it!! Not recommend!
1.0,"Smells sooooo bad. Seriously smells like body odor and pepper. Not a bad bag at all, in terms of quality but I can't get past the smell. It's also a lot more sparkly than I thought it would be. I would genuinely feel like a disco ball carrying this."
1.0,The bracelet discolored the same week I brought it.  Horrible purchase even for the cost.
1.0,I know it said gold coated but I expected to be able to wear it more than once without turning my toe green. Only a couple of them would be able to be used as toe rings the rest are really big and more like knuckle rings but my teenage daughter uses them as regular rings because they are so big. Take that how you want but if you plan on walking in flip flops or exposing the rings to any kind of abrasiveness then dont waste your money
1.0,These are a terrible fabric - shiny and much brighter red than the photo. They also have a seam down the front of each leg that is not pictured in the photo.
1.0,"For true to size, but fells like Halloween costume material... horrible fabric"
1.0,"These are definitely not made for us ladies with a round read end.  The front covers fine and I am no skinny minny there either, but the backside sits well below my waist which was not my goal when ordering a 'high waist' item.  Even worse, they really don't move with me so I have to keep pulling up and adjusting.  All this and I actually ordered a size larger than I wear in street clothes.  Consider yourself warned."
1.0,Bracelet broke 1 week after I gave it as a gift. My wife put it on and it snapped. Disappointed
1.0,The small was way too wide a fit; with loose buttons.
1.0,"This jacket looks nothing like the picture. It is huge, shapeless and boxy, and it was a mess because it came in a tiny little package and was so crushed up there would have been no way to straighten this out. Its going back immediately."
1.0,"Unfortunately,  this is nowhere near true to size. My sister who is usually a 16 could not fit in the 4x due to the fabric having NO give."
1.0,Bought size large for teenage girl (99lbs!). The sleeves were short and tight.
1.0,Smallest medium I have ever seen.
1.0,This material can hardly qualify as leather.  The necklace literally snapped as my friend was showing her other friend the pearl.  This is extremely cheap and poor quality.
1.0,"Broke, dead battery, need the seller to contact me asap"
1.0,Wow the color is nothing like advertised. I needed a mustard yellow like in the pic but instead it was this hideous brownish yellow. I was sent a L/XL instead of the medium I ordered. It was good though bc a medium NEVER would have fit. I typically wear a size 6 jeans as comparison.<br />The material is not at all forgiving. Soft as could be and would be fine in loose comfy pants I suppose. But these are not that. I am returning them. Quality is fine I assume. Couldn’t see any direct flaws in that regard.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:916aa9aee483be3164a70fee8dbd4b7b]] It turned copper within a month of me having it. NOT STAINLESS. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK
1.0,Gloves are extremely thin. Did not hold up to me rolling a spare tire across driveway. All of the fingertips tore open. Might be okay for cleaning but not for working.
1.0,The band is way too small. I guess it's fine for the diminutive men from the country of origin but not something the average normal man can expect to fit him. I will give it to one of the children in the family as it's more sized for a child or woman than a man.
1.0,The teeth bent easily and the loops were sometimes open at the end causing it to get caught in your hair. Not for thick or course wavy hair.
1.0,"While the appearance of these were nice, they were sized incorrectly. I have worn a 7 my entire adult life and could not get these on my fingers. Too small. I checked my other size 7 rings that I own to make sure I didnt simply gain a subtle amount of weight but they fit fine. Id have ordered another set of these but I worry they simply won't fit correctly even if I order a bigger size."
1.0,These are pretty but flimsy and they were all broke up upon arriving came in a bag should have been in a box
1.0,This was definitely not “American” plus size! It does not have spandex! Cute skirts but too tight around the belly!
1.0,The shirt was poorly constructed.
1.0,I ordered a  size 8 and I still could not fit my foot in it
1.0,I thought  I was getting  100% Sterling silver did not get that The bracelet turned Brown and turned my wrist green I would not recommend  Buying again
1.0,Do not purchase. Take your $45 to Walmart and get a better sweatshirt than this!<br />It is so thin I feel like I will rip it. It is not warm. It’s literally just a thin piece of material. You can’t even tell the picture on the shirt.. it’s super pixelated. Not even worth the 1 star I gave!
1.0,"This dress is see through in some areas. I looked like I was scheduled to churn butter, but needed to work the corner right after. 0/5 for me. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
1.0,Very comfortable but not durable. The strap ripped through the sole within 2 weeks of regular wear.
1.0,"Wow!! Biggest disappointment of product I’ve ever had from Amazon!.. I had to get a replacement pair because what I received had one of the lenses “burnt” it was fuzzy, couldn’t see thru, like it had been exposed to heat or something.. replacement came and both of those lenses were “burnt” and melted- the same but now both had it!! I’d run far and not buy this.. !"
1.0,Extremely pathetic and poor item and sssooo cheaply made it’s sad. The photo looks as though it’s chiffon and it looks like something a kindergartener made. I promise you that I will NEVER recommend or purchase anything else from this seller. I just donated the item as even though I found it extremely disturbing it could be a blessing to someone else. Beware that the item in the photo IS NOT what you will get. I wish I could erase all of the stars and replace them with an emoji face saying “SERIOUSLY”!!
1.0,"I took a chance on this item with no reviews because I recognized the name and thought,”I’ve purchased socks from this brand, not this style but, I have had luck with their products.” I figured these are one size fits all and probably made out of stretch lace and have silicone around them to help keep them up. I liked the idea of these since one, they’re pretty, and two, if they happen to show through maybe they’d sort of blend and look like part of my ballet flats.<br /><br />Well, these didn’t have the silicone stays, and biggie for me, they didn’t fit! I wear a 10m in shoes and was expecting these to fit no problem. As you can see from the photos they don’t fit at all. Also I’d like to add that the sizing was inconsistent. With the pair I tried on one covered the bottom of my foot and the other didn’t. If I straighten out my foot or tried to step down in these they just popped right off! One size doesn’t fit all only some...maybe.<br /><br />I will be returning these once the nude set comes in. ZERO STARS for these and the fit. Maybe someone with smaller feet would find these useful for them but not someone like me who doesn’t have petite little tootsies.<br /><br />****UPDATED REVIEW ****<br /><br />I received the nude set of the socks and you can clearly see the size difference. While they do fit better I’m still sending both sets back. The idea of pretty lace no show socks was good in theory but I feel like wearing them I’d get a few uses if that before they tore. The toe should have reinforcement and I think therw should be grips on the inside to keep them from slipping off your feet."
1.0,WOW! Next time I order clothes I'll be sure to check where they are made. I wear a size 14/16 and I was looking for a dress that flows so I looked under plus size and ordered a 2XL. THIS DRESS IS SUPER THIN AND SKIN TIGHT!!!!! There is no way this is considered plus size let alone 2xl in the USA. So disappointed.....returning immediately.
1.0,"The strap will not stay attached to the glasses. In fact, one side won’t even stay closed properly. Time to search for something else. So disappointed"
1.0,The shirt had a small hole by the neck line and I can wear it at all. I missed my return window and would like another sent to me for costumer satisfaction. Truly disappointed that the product was not inspected for quality before shipping it out to me. Can anything be done. I still have the shirt with tag and never worn. Please help. Thank you Any Camargo
1.0,"Ordered my size and they were too small.  If you order, order them at least a size larger.  Unfortunately, the most popular sizes have very limited selections, or not available at all. Skip these and buy a different brand."
1.0,Nice sweater very soft and comfy-  but only got to wear it one time.
1.0,Shirt is just oddly made and doesn’t hold its shape well.  Have never worn it
1.0,Not with exspect
1.0,Broken and dose not work
1.0,"Very nice ,handsome watch."
1.0,This is not worth the price. It doesn't work WELL AT ALL!!!! I don't recommend this product at all!!! I will return this product. ☹
1.0,I put it on my wrist and the first day of me wearing it the material started to fray and fall apart!
1.0,I ordered a 3x and it came...i had to give it to my 5’3 daughter in law because it was that small...
1.0,This dress looks adorable in the photos but it's horrible. The fabric is so thin you can practically see through it. I ordered an xl for my 15 year old daughter and it was so small it could fit an 8 yr old. Big waste of time.
1.0,They fell apart within a year.
1.0,This overalls cannot be a small.  I measured them and the measurements are for large or extra large. I can never wear the. Very disappointing.  They look nothing  like the picture.  The size  is mostly my complaint how am l ever suppose to wear them . I am a size  2-5 depending on the  manufacturing.  What solution are you going to come up with. 95% of everthing l ordered from l am very happy with. $$$doesnt come around offen . I budget  a certain  Amount of money for close  every 2 year's  .. How  can this situation  be resolved.  I already washed the overalls hoping they would shrink.  No luck. What is the next move to resolve this issue  thank you.
1.0,there was no crystal in the middle as advertised and shown in the picture as what we will be buying.
1.0,I hate giving bad reviews but this dress was disappointing. Flimsy stretchy fabric that you’d need to stretch around yourself then wrap around and hope it didn’t just fling open. I wouldn’t if I were you. Unless you’re planning to wear it only a few minutes in an intimate setting and strip. I think it could be perfect for that. :)
1.0,The ankle area was not fitted as expected. Very loose look.
1.0,"Definitely not a compression sleeve.  More like a thick nylon pantyhose on your arm!  Be careful washing it.  Again, like pantyhose, the material will &#34;run&#34;."
1.0,"The coat is kind of cute, but when you get it, the material and zipper feels really cheap and poorly made. It is also WAAAAAY too small. In no other store would I be anything other than a medium or large, but this large was probably 2 sizes too small. Must be for Asian sizing.<br /><br />Spend an extra 20-30 bucks and get something much better."
1.0,The placement of the pockets is too high.  It is not a comfortable way to use them and it causes the jacket to have an unflattering fit.  I wanted something warm and cozy and this has no warmth.
1.0,"Very cheap and ugly in person. Also, you cannot return them"
1.0,It is cute and nicely made.  It is about a child’s medium.  It is definitely not a women’s XL.  My daughter tried to give it to her friend who wears a size 2 but it was too small.
1.0,"I loved the style but it wasn’t exactly comfortable. The arms part of glasses (temples) often got stuck in my hair. This thin metal part got knots with my hair. In addition, one of the nosepads fell apart. Very poor quality."
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger than needed. Still way too small.
1.0,Beautiful but you get what you pay  for. Half the stones fell out after 3 times wearing it
1.0,This item is not a large the waist band is more of a medium.
1.0,Stupid
1.0,The thing about this necklace is they are branding it as unisex. Please note that the front of the necklace is much bigger than the back as the beads in the front are bigger and they get gradually smaller as you move towards the back of the necklace. I have never seen a men's necklace like this ever.<br /><br />Anytime I see a necklace that has big beads in the front that gradually get smaller in the back it's usually a woman's necklace. So when I tried this on it felt very weird wearing it because I just couldn't get used to a man like myself wearing beads that are bigger than the front getting smaller in the back and just felt like it was meant for women and not necessarily unisex.<br /><br />Although there are some guys who will love this. I was hoping all the beads would be the exact same size. Based on the angle of the pictures displayed on their listing it made it a little bit hard to decipher that the beads were bigger in the front based on the angle itself.
1.0,My grandson who is 9 said it was way too big for a kid
1.0,"They sent me a one piece instead of a two piece. I ordered and wanted my two piece. Stretchy, but cheap cottony acrylic material instead of the silky like material that is usually used with these outfits. You will need to go commando because panty lines can be seen in this one. Too much hassle during Covid to return. They dont answer phone, or anything, and now i paid for a falsely advertised product!! Because of how this was handled, I dont tell anyone where I purchased the outfit so they dont get bamboozled. If you are open to a one piece instead of the two piece then order. Purchased in the light pink color in a size small."
1.0,The XL probably fits a 6 yr old girl. I know they stretch but come on don’t label them a size XL when they’re XXXXS
1.0,"I don’t get the hype, one they go to my arm pits and second one of these least flattering leggings I own. There are better options on Amazon just need to do a little research"
1.0,"The minute hand broke off within 3 weeks of less than normal wear. The warranty is a joke and there is no phone number listed for the US retailer. Awesome concept, poor construction. I would not recommend anyone buy this."
1.0,"Def not what the picture shows. It’s cheep fabric, not woven. It looks more like T-shirt material would the a printed design on it. My daughters even hated it. I’d prefer my money back.  Instead it’s gong straight into the donations pile.  It won’t even make it into a closet in our house."
1.0,I would give this product zero star ⭐️ if I could waist of my money don't buy it it's extra thin pour quality material
1.0,"My husband and I sat in them and toppled over when we tried to lean back. Couldn’t adjust them tight enough to get any support. Not worth the money. Be aware that they are shipped from China and my attempt to return them has not gone well. And I’m hoping I don’t have to pay postage, as drop off at UPS was not an option. Good luck and manage your expectations."
1.0,"Within 24 hours of receiving, the goggles broke. I do not recommend."
1.0,"Smaller than expected, material smells funny and cross straps are poorly attached"
1.0,"I hate writing a bad review, but the online photo makes this necklace look much nicer (higher quality) than it is.  Unfortunately I had to return it because I didn't feel comfortable giving it as a gift.  The chain is hair thin and looks so fragile -- and the clasps are very cheap and small like costume jewelry.  The pearl itself looked okay but the diamond is virtually too tiny to see.  But it arrived quickly and I had no problem returning it.  Sorry... : ("
1.0,"These masks are too small. (I bought three) They are too tight on my face, my father couldn’t even get them to hook around his ears because they are so small. They are more like child size. I contacted the seller about returning them and they said that the mailing system would take too long and they didn’t want me to return them, they told me I could have half my money back to buy extensions. After a few days I messaged them to confirm the half payment back and they changed their minds and said I could only have $1 back for each one, so $3.00 for all of them. I told them that I was told I could have half my money back because I couldn’t wear them. They never returned that message, half my money, or even $3.00 of it."
1.0,Product is two sizes smaller then intended. I’m a 18/20 and ordered a 3XL women’s. As soon as I took it out of the package I knew it was too small. I had my teenage daughter try it on. She is typically a large in a tee and it was tight on her.
1.0,"Very cheaply made. Not the same look as the pictures. I also thought that it would have rinestones, not glitter bits. It just looks so cheap and feels like cardboard. I actually ordered this for my wedding day, something to wear as I'm getting ready. What a mistake... very dissapointed."
1.0,Smallest size is way too big even using the size chart. Cute shoe though!
1.0,"I really like it, but it came with a missing stone. Looking to get my money back."
1.0,"It looked really nice and was a great buy I thought based on the way it looked, but then the clip broke in about two days."
1.0,"Followed instructions for measuring band size and even added 1 size up to be safe, since the number I measured seemed way too small. Bra was still too small so returned it."
1.0,This is NOT an UNTUCKIT a shirt ! Beware!! Do not buy!! Made in China. False advertisement!
1.0,This is an expensive pair of underwear only to find its fit is too small.  Bought a much larger size than needed because wanted a room fit but it was cut completely wrong.  Would never buy again.
1.0,Too big. Disappointed
1.0,As others have described - these are light weight socks with very poor elastic - NOT full cushion heavy duty work socks.  The quality is so poor I seriously doubt these are a Fruit of the Loom product.  Reviews going back to the summer of 2020 have pointed out that this is an inferior product but Amazon has allowed this company to continue selling this item.
1.0,I could smell the mold before I even took them out of the package. The front and back of every pair is covered in mold<br /> Disgusting.
1.0,Strap broke the first time my daughter put the suit on! Also there was a stain on the inside liner.
1.0,Definitely disappointed please contact me regarding my feedback i have additional questions. My husbands top one doesnt even fit and its very flimsy
1.0,"They fit OK, but I would hate to think these were the only socks I had if it were 15°F much less 35 below.  look somewhere else, these socks suck. My feet still sweat and get cold"
1.0,The zipper broke the very first time I tried it on.  Thank goodness I ordered early enough to purchase something else.
1.0,Too long and heavy
1.0,"I was glad to have earrings that were cheap- and fast delivery (of course- prime).<br /><br />The earrings are now some dis colored, almost black tone. Not sure why? I have them in until I can get a replacement. Not sure how worth my time it would be to ask for a replacement pair."
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. It is not worth the price. It looks like something worth $25. The chain is no thin it will probably break trying to put it on.  Save your money!
1.0,"Product was very poorly made. I tried item on to make sure it fit as it fit me perfect I love the item, it then fell apart at two different seam areas."
1.0,I got ripped off
1.0,Very cheap looking. Thin and not attractive at all.
1.0,Looks nothing like it did online. Looks cheap!!
1.0,I ordered a 4 pm and only received a 2 pk
1.0,"They were not the correct product, not correctly marked, for a specific event, and there were no replacements in stock. As you can see in the picture the yellow and black retro sunglasses were in fact red."
1.0,To big for little kids. Better for teens.
1.0,Glasses arrived with a broken clip. Not usable.
1.0,"This mask is so large, only people with gigantic heads should buy it."
1.0,If I could leave no stars I would. I ordered an XL which is a size up than I normally buy and it fits like a medium!!!
1.0,This Dress would be sure cute if there was any type of mesh or lining under the lace at the top but there isn't. This is more of a see through bra-lette attached to a shirt than a dress.
1.0,update..both are broken and USELESS! They don't stay screwed on and both ripped off the eyelet when I was screwing them in. there is no way to fix them. Contacted seller and no reply so BUYER BEWARE!
1.0,Fell apart within a couple days
1.0,It was way to small  I would like the next size up if possible
1.0,Cheap is as cheap is.
1.0,I was looking so forward to a nice flannel robe but this isn't the one. The armholes are tiny and it feels very uncomfortable wearing this robe. I do NOT recommend ordering this robe.
1.0,This necklace smelled so bad I had to wrap it in 2 paper towels and then place in 3 different plastic bags to return it.
1.0,These are so so so tiny that I don't think you could see them on an infants ear. They did not have a logo on the box although it was neatly wrapped.  But do not waste your money. They are not the size that is shown in the picture.  I was quite dissappointed
1.0,Listing said this was “heavyweight”...farthest thing from the truth!
1.0,"Sizing is ridiculous, screen printing is cheap and you can bet it will wash out quickly"
1.0,"This dress would be great if you're 5 feet tall however, I'm 5'8"" tall.  The waist made it more like an empire waist."
1.0,"I got a medium I'm 6'2"" 180 slim build big tush. Shorts are very short. At first I thought I liked it when I just tried it on. I wore it out and it was HORRIBLY uncomfortable. Sitting down and standing up was quite a task because the material has ABSOLUTELY NO GIVE. Threw it in the dumpster the moment I got home. Good for a mannequin but not a human body."
1.0,I ordered a size 9 and got a size 6. I don't know anyone who wears that size. So I am stuck with them
1.0,Don't buy these for your child! Save your money! The material is not stretchy at all and I would have hurt him trying to force them on.
1.0,"If you have a strong break it will damage the rack and it will no longer give a tight rack after only a few breaks. If I knew ahead, I would have never purchased. I gave 1 star because 0 wasnt an option."
1.0,Don’t waste your money on these pants! They are not worth it! Pockets were sewn together and the pants fell apart in the washer.
1.0,Online cheater
1.0,Didn’t like that they were just all tossed into a clear bag bunched up and they smelled bad like someone’s bad perfume
1.0,The adhesive did not hold and the other bras were only in a c cup. Which did not work for me.
1.0,Arrived mangled. Not happy
1.0,"Definitely looks better in the picture, but it's more of a style for older (35+) women than it is for younger women. The bust line is too high and isn't shaped right. It is NOT a sweetheart neckline, it is a bizarre flat sweetheart that makes the shoulders look wider than they actually are. The shoulders also aren't fitted right."
1.0,Two buttons broke the first time I opened them!!! Tags still on the shirt and everything...
1.0,"This was purchased for my 17 year in old daughter . Poor  fabric, quality and fit. Design was nice."
1.0,the material is vey cheap and thin
1.0,Hated these stretchy Modal they were totally not what I expected.
1.0,"These shorts were hideously ugly, and the fabric felt terrible."
1.0,Straps are way too thick compared to picture and  basically make it a shirt
1.0,"I'm a 36A but I read that the As have tons of padding, so I ordered a 34B and a 36A. On the 34B, padding was reasonable, and it actually looked OK on. The plunge is nice and the sides are wide. However, I was getting some gapping, and it was crazy tight, even with the included extender, as many other reviewers said. On the 36A, there was a ridiculous amount of padding. I could have used it for a life jacket. It was also way too tight. Both bras were very uncomfortable. I wouldn't wear this bra for 15 minutes."
1.0,"This product was very uncomfortable to wear. It is rigid and there is no cushion along the head. It seems to run small; the strap was barely long enough to fit my head, and I'm a small man. It was so uncomfortable that I tore it off after just a couple minutes. Definitely would not recommend it."
1.0,I received a Men's Swimsuit size 34 instead of my shirt after waiting for weeks.  Still waiting for a review for return.
1.0,the ring was bent and the post on the earing was bent and loose....not very happy with this product....
1.0,"The material felt nice, almost silky. The wine color  was very saturated and nice. Unfortunately, it runs really large all over. The sleeves are so big that the crisscrosses don’t lay well. The pockets at the hips made my hips and midsection look huge. I am currently very underweight. I tried to tie a knot<br />on the side to see if that would help- it didn’t, at all. This is a very unflattering dress. It would<br />be helpful to come in an XS."
1.0,False advertising  shows it works with active 2 it is to big for either 40 or 44 do not buy if you have one of those
1.0,Only good for a wash n style lol
1.0,Very poor quality.  Fit very small
1.0,My girfriend is medium size but this Large size product is stil very tied for her
1.0,"I was impressed with these joggers for all of about two-three months (after the return window) before things started to go down hill fast. Granted, they looked and felt great when they were still holding together, but that wasn’t for long at all.<br /><br />The fabric is extremely cheap and started pilling almost immediately, especially in the crotch/butt area. It is decently thick, but not enough to keep you truly warm. On top of that, I exclusively wash my darks gently and with cold water but this wasn’t enough to stop the fabric from fading.<br /><br />Next, the stitching and gluing is awful, especially around the pockets. One of mine is starting to completely rip out and the other isn’t far behind.<br /><br />All of the reflective parts of the pants don’t work anymore, and the decals are splitting chipping exponentially more with every wear.<br /><br />I’ve worn these pants maybe about a dozen times since I’ve bought them and can’t wear them anymore in public without looking like I dug them out of the trash.<br /><br />Avoid buying these at all costs. A pair of plain black sweatpants will look better for longer, and are probably more comfortable."
1.0,"Everything about it is awful, is not what I expected, the material, the size, the shape of it, everything is wrong. I have an Offstream suit and I would say this is a ""Knock-Off Sttram"" It was supposed to have blue lining and has pink very bad stitching."
1.0,"These are 16g, not 18g. You can’t just shove a 16g into an 18g rook, especially when you have very sensitive cartilage. I was excited I finally found 18g curved bars. Do not buy this!"
1.0,Arrived with hole in pants
1.0,Malisimo
1.0,"I was very excited to get these socks, as after reading previous reviews, I was certain they'd be worth every penny.  I've been having some leg issues including shin splints and soreness in my calves.  When the package arrived, I pulled them out and was ready to put them on immediately.  I loved the bright pink color and felt relief in my legs almost instantly!  However, a mere THREE HOURS after I put them on, I had a hole in the toe.  I did not run with them on, I didn't even have shoes on.  I was just wearing them around my house.  I might expect this from a cheap pair of nylons, but not socks that I spent over $40 on.  These were put back in the package almost as quickly as they came out."
1.0,Not happy it all.
1.0,I don’t get the good reviews about this jumpsuit.  I’m 5’8” and 160. I ordered the gray color in the large.  It was too small and way shorter than pictured.  The fabric was super flimsy and showed every little bump and bulge. I would never go out in public wearing this.  I consider this a total waste of money.
1.0,The ring really did not look like 14K gold; looked fake.
1.0,You get the quality you pay for. Seem ripped the 3rd time I wore them
1.0,I ordered the correct size for myself according to the size chart but it was way too small in the chest by about 6 inches! I had to return it for refund.
1.0,Cute but I couldn’t breath comfortably in my mask nor could anyone else I gifted them to.
1.0,"Let me start by saying I am fully aware that this product is $5 but..... these shorts fit my 4T fitting daughter. They were supposed to be for my 10 year old stepson lol. He looked at then and laughed. WAY TOO SMALL. And this was the largest size they had for kids. Had no choice but to buy a small adult men’s size. And that was perfect length wise but width wise..... too large, of course. I had to take in the sides it was free because I did it but it was also not the best looking because I did lol."
1.0,Very poor quality. Leather from strap shed all over tank top.
1.0,Bad choice!!! Picture looked better!!!!
1.0,The snap on the front compartment started to tear after a month of use.
1.0,"It was way more snug below my chest then I’d like, and it dropped at the top of my chest, wasn’t the best."
1.0,"I’ve bought enough these twice before and loved them, however something changed! The length of the post is wayyyyyyy to long! If you try to wear these it sticks halfway off your nose. I’m sad cuz these have been my go to for a couple years now."
1.0,rather large
1.0,Way overpriced for too small of an item. Put actual measurement in description.
1.0,"Terrible. Thick course material. Band size is fine but cup size is way small. Doesn’t push-up, smashes down. Not flattering or comfortable."
1.0,"TOO disappointed - such a beautiful blouse but the sizing is all wrong.  There's no tag or size chart (only gives measure up to X-Large for U.S. bust size 42), so how can I tell?  I ordered size XX-large and I only wear a size 36C.  Yet I could not comfortably get this blouse on and didn't try for fear of ripping the seams when taking off.  The lace at the top is partly scraggly at the edges and at places disconnected.  Even its beauty could not keep me from giving this blouse only one star."
1.0,I expected this nightgown to be of the same quality as the one I purchased a few months ago.  It is not as soft and the material is much thinner.  I will not buy another.
1.0,knot in the center of shoe most uncomfortable shoe ive ever worn.
1.0,Item broke after first day.
1.0,I purchased these because the description and the pic says Taupe!  It's hard to find the lighter shade of taupe so I was so excited to find these.  What I received is Smokey Taupe.  I bought them to go with a light beige/taupe coat.  Completely misleading.  The last pic is from the Iso. website.  It shows the Smokey Taupe color.
1.0,Plastic not metal or ceramic
1.0,Not good quality. Way to small.
1.0,"Expected a higher quality print for the price of 24.99, it’s a printer transfer NOT a silk screen. Image looks like my kid drew it on with crayola markers! Laughable for the cost I paid.( I could have done this at home with an iron on print I made from our printer, and it would have been better!!) Bought for a bday gift but will most likely return item."
1.0,It didn't last and it wasn't confortable
1.0,Item arrived broken very poor quality as well.
1.0,It broke in two days
1.0,"Received them in a timely manner and looked to be what I expected. However, there were holes in two of the hats after I washed them! They had not been worn at all; I washed them immediately to be safe for my baby."
1.0,Mother had it for a month never wore it and the gold faded
1.0,First it looks cheap and then it was cheap. The zipper does not work properly.<br />Gary B Hill Sr
1.0,"I bought this package of earrings mostly for the black tassel earrings. After receiving it one of the tassel earrings completely fell apart, making the other one useless too. I tried to see if I could get another pair or get a refund, but apparently can't do so without sending the whole package back. I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world but I was hoping to be able to wear them out a few times before they fell apart."
1.0,Terrible cheap coating. I tried to open it to put it on and it broke
1.0,The jeans are cute but fit irregularly - did not fit like a 2XL
1.0,"Smallest 9mm I've ever seen, I typically wear an 8mm and this 9 mm was too small."
1.0,Do not buy these!  They look & feel great out of the package but shrink and deteriorate after washing & drying.  Too expensive for this poor quality.
1.0,It felt flimsy and the peace sign was out of alignment. Nice packaging and shipping as promised.
1.0,"Can't fit shaft nor balls into this pouch,  not stretchy enough, very disappointed with it."
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed with this ring. As soon as I opened the package three off the stones fell out. It was inexpensive and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it,"
1.0,Wasn't happy at all with neleus women's 3 pack loved the colors but one came in a small one was a lg and one was a xx lg only used 1 i order xx lg
1.0,Lost my shorts!!!
1.0,Been wearing for only 2 weeks and already coming apart at the seem.. disappointed.
1.0,Poor quality material and sewing is not neat
1.0,"I paid more for the dark ones, and they sent it with blue seams. I ordered 2 ( 2 packs of 2) and only arrived 1 and looks nothing like the picture"
1.0,This item is a joke..it wasn't even sewn correctly/in a straight line so the whole garment was asymmetrical/out of whack.  It looked like a bad thrift store find.
1.0,After a few days stretches so actually I could have bought a much smaller size in length because now it is to big for my waist size
1.0,Quality is not as shown. Very cheat material.
1.0,When I first saw the picture of the jacket it looked like the person wearing the jacket had his hand in a pocket. To my surprise there is no pockets. The picture was misleading.
1.0,Didn't fit well and had to throw away after first wear.
1.0,Really these glasses are useless they do not stay closed when u. Try to put on your make up I’ve already thrown them out just a heads up
1.0,"I ordered a small and the sweater was way too big (5’2, 140lbs). Makes you look bulky. Very disappointed."
1.0,totally useless
1.0,"It says that it was delivered with my Spiderman  backpack, it was NOT in the box..."
1.0,"I ordered a large and it would fit my 7 year old granddaughter.  Awful purchase!  Coupled with the fact that it was said to be true to size.  Trust me, DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,Cute. Can't wear in water
1.0,The mask fit too small. VERY disappointed!
1.0,no adjust for size
1.0,This product doesn’t even deserve one star!<br />Used it may be 3-4 times. My God! It became sooo loose it started riding down. I wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Definitely a case of you get what you pay for.  The plastic around the nosepiece and rim disintegrated and fell apart.  Couldn't even attempt to super glue them back together it was crumbling so much.
1.0,Ordered Large normally wear a small/medium and it was way to tight on me.
1.0,Disappointed in the quality of this product. Smudged with the ink from other ones being sent caked together?? Also the saying that says “take your time” is totally messed up on both sides. Not worth $11 at all. Not worth going out to return either.
1.0,"Cute but made of weird material... broke into 4pieces and inside , under metal coating, was cement?Clay?  1 star for cuteness."
1.0,"Too stiff, uncomfortable to apply the color with."
1.0,Cheap quality arrived ripped several seams left open.
1.0,This is a great example of why I am afraid to buy clothes online. The color was way off. It does not look like how it shows. And the material and skirt itself looks like something you would wear as a costume or part of a costume.. a really cheap costume. The material is very cheap looking. Honestly it's very ugly. I will definitely be returning this.
1.0,"I bought a pair in the spring and absolutely loved them. Classic, well-made aviator sunglasses. Unfortunately, I left them on a counter at the local grocery store. When I returned 10 minutes later to retrieve them, they were gone and no employee claimed to have seen them. Obviously, an employee or customer helped themselves.<br /><br />So I bought a new pair a couple of days ago and they arrived today. Very disappointing - these are extremely flimsy; they feel like they could break if dropped on a carpet. This second pair is no different than the cheap, easily-broken sunglasses you buy for $1 at Dollar Tree or 99-Cent Store."
1.0,Way to expensive not worth it
1.0,"garbage...a paper disk under plastic...i guess you get what you pay for, what was I expecting!"
1.0,2 of the 3 shirts I ordered started coming apart at the seams after 1 wearing. These shirts are horribly made and not worth the money.<br />Don't buy!
1.0,LOVE HOW THE WATCH LOOKS BUT IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 DAYS. SUCH A SHAME FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING WATCH
1.0,broke extremely fast. shipping was fine but the product is not durable
1.0,"I installed the batteries per the indicated polarity, however, the lights did not function"
1.0,"Stone looks cheap; worse, chain arrived covered in packing tape and was broken. Cubic zirconias are almost invisible to the naked eye. Will be returning."
1.0,"Definitely run small so I ordered 2 XL pairs based on the size chart.  Took forever to get here and when they did, I could only put one pair on.  The other pair was way too small even though the tags said they were the same size.  And even worse, the inside isn't even ""super thick cashmere.""  It's just some fuzzy white stuff.  Save your money and spend it on something else!"
1.0,I liked them until I picked them up and the arm fell off after about a week of light use. Flimsy and I don't recommend if you want them to last.
1.0,Crap material
1.0,This piece arrived broken.  I have reached out to seller.
1.0,They are too small and not the type I thought they was. Didn’t fit at all
1.0,Broken same day just trying it
1.0,On the model it looks like she is swimming in it  and it doesn't look translucent  and it is I also didn`t  realize one side was longer than the other.
1.0,"I bought these for my son. Within the first 4 days the lights stopped working, the next day the cord fell apart leaving exposed wires close to skin contact and the sole detached from the shoe. Needless to say, I trashed them. Not worth."
1.0,Super bad fabric and durability.  Photo was taken after 1 wearing and washing.
1.0,"This thing is weird. I don't like it, I regret buying it. The zipper in the middle is pointless and strange and the sweater is extremely flimsy. It doesn't look anything like the photo, the color is faded and washed out… bad purchase on the whole."
1.0,Bra is uncomfortable.  B cup is too large.  I wore it a couple of days in order to get used to it but I gave up wearing it .  I would like to return it but had it for more than 30 days but then I didn't wear it right away upon purchasing it so what can I do?
1.0,Product does not with stand at all
1.0,Very thin material.  Cheap feel
1.0,From the picture this looks like its quite long. It barely came to my upper thigh I'll give it to my granddaughter as I can't wear it.
1.0,You get what you pay for - this would have been a good deal if the strap wasn't so short. I can't get it to the last hole to close it .<br /><br />John Bauer
1.0,The colors and print  was exactly like the picture.  But the fit was absolutely nothing like the picture.  The material was very flimsy and unsuitable for bathing wear.  I would not wear this suit to the pool for fear of immediate exposure in the water.  Do not waste your money.
1.0,It's way way way too small.
1.0,"False description, it’s regular material, not grosgrain silk (ribbed look and feel). Don’t waste your time or money."
1.0,"One wire was out of the battery pack, so it didn’t work!"
1.0,Wore them for 1 hour and holes started to appear!
1.0,I tried putting this item on every which way. it was impossible difficult to get on ear and once its on you cant move if you do it falls off after every couple step. I actually think the clip is on wrong side of dragon.
1.0,super ugly and tight dont recommend
1.0,They don't stay on my glasses
1.0,"EXTREMELY SMALL!!! The torso is MUCH too short for any proportional adult human. The seller refused to let me return the item, saying that they only do so when a product is damaged or defective. To me, an adult bathing suit that will only fit a child IS defective -- hence the term &#34;short-waisted.&#34;  ----Extremely dissatisfied."
1.0,Listed as 36 pairs.  When i received it was 18 pairs. False advertisement.  and I wouldn't have wasted my money had I known
1.0,Not very pleased because picture doesn't reflect actual item. The white jacket has a black zipper part and looks awful compared the picture. READ DETAILS so you womt be disappointed. Returning and won't be buy from this deceptive business again.
1.0,"it balls up real fast and looks cheap, feels cheap and comes up the ears all day ,,, dont waste your money"
1.0,Arrived broken ):
1.0,It took months for me to get the product then after I’ve had it a few days I was notified that the return window was closed. In contacting the seller I was told it was too expensive to return and that they would just give me half my money back. The material is very cheap and thin and wrinkles if you just pick it up. And it was much smaller than a size large. Most disappointing I’ve ever been with an Amazon product.
1.0,Product broke after first use.. the strap around ankle broke after first use.. very cheap quality..
1.0,The gloves said that they would not tear they do and very easily  not a good brand
1.0,"Horrible design, stitching, too long.  Grandma skirt."
1.0,Unfortunately the silver wrapped around the stone turned to dark and rusty and is also causing a rash.  Cannot wear this any longer.
1.0,Did not look anything like the picture. Weird polyester type material. Do not recommend this seller.
1.0,This dress is made for women size zero otherwise it just looks weird and cheap.
1.0,If I could give this shirt 0 stars I will. Please don't waste your time and money on this not worth it.
1.0,So I have only had this purse for a few months and the leather peace that the strap clips into is already breaking. Which makes me angry Becuase when you pay a good bit of money for something you want it to last.
1.0,"Got these cuz the designs are cute but waist of money!!! They are way to big, like you could just wear them as earrings"
1.0,"RIP rose gold watch. You were pretty, but you died of natural causes five days into your short life."
1.0,"I don't know what this material is. One thing is for certain though--THIS ISNT EVEN ALMOST LINEN! These are really unattractive pants. This is false advertising at its worst. The material, the color, the size are all inaccurate."
1.0,Chain is so flimsy it broke in a day
1.0,Dress was clearly not new! Had deodorant marks in the breast area. It’s too take to return I’ve an event soon so I had to send to cleaners smh
1.0,I normally wear a medium in this dresses from this company and it’s super tight like if I had ordered an extra small<br />Waist of time had to return it
1.0,"Mala calidad de la tela, malisima"
1.0,"I purchased these last Month to hang my purse at the office. It got stuck the 3rd time I used it and wouldn't fold. Somehow managed to loosen and fold it. Next time I tried hanging my purse, it fell off because the link which connects the hanging link to the disk broke. Very poor quality."
1.0,"I'm just a thick-thighed cutie looking for some thigh-high socks to wear on cam, but these aren't even good for a photoshoot. They're super long and fit my legs well (I'm 5' 8"" with some nice gams), but as soon as they got the middle of my thighs, they lost all integrity. They're basically stockings and NOT socks, so they rolled down IMMEDIATELY after I let them go. Pulled them up again and stood up to see if they'd hold at all, and once again they immediately rolled down--all the way down to my calves.<br /><br />I'm a lot on the thicker side and carry my weight mainly in my hips, butt, and thighs, so I don't expect everything to fit like a dream. However, my thighs aren't much bigger than the models' in the photo they use, so I really thought that these would work."
1.0,Came in the wrong style and with a stain. Material feels cheap.
1.0,Image looks like a poorly printed ironon
1.0,"I ordered a Youth S/M for my 8 y/o grandson who lives in a different state than I do. There was no standard (universal) sizing chart for Youth sizes to go by only Adult sizing chart.  I had to assume the sizes were based on 5/6 or 7/8, 10/12, etc. NOT, the Jersey won’t fit my grand or another couple of yrs. I wear an adult 7/8, it might be a tad-bit snug but I could fit it.  Blame was put on Amazon’s sizing chart restrictions. I can say the Vendor’s customer srvc was better than some because they responded to my complaints expeditiously. I was advised that I should have measured my grand’s chest, The shirt was displayed as an adult S/M -32” chest. I advised the vendor that 1, my grand was not available to measure & 2, the only time body measurements were done was by a seamstress when I had a dress made. I wasn’t doing the measuring & would doubt my accuracy.<br /><br />I opted to keep the Jersey because my grand’s name was on it v/s chancing ordering another to have the same size issues. I was given a 40% discount. Something is better than nothing I guess for a Jersey that will hang in a closet for a year or two. I def would NOT recommend ordering ANY Youth apparel from this vendor until sizes for youth are displayed so you know exactly what you are ordering especially since it’s a customized Jersey."
1.0,"They are not accurately described in size.  The return policy is unreasonable.  Won,t allow me to post a picture"
1.0,These were too tight and the fabric was cheap.
1.0,"Just awful, fabric was thin and itchy, felt like paper."
1.0,"The top does not fit as tightly as the waist.  Love the fabric, a little see thru on the skirt but the top is just wide open and extremely loose.  Needs a seam to hold your boobs up."
1.0,"Item Received Did Not Match Pictures From Posting, specifically the Player Name on the Backside of the Jersey.  Item was returned."
1.0,I was so excited to buy this 6 pack of bras for so cheap. But once I received the package iinstead of getting 6 bras I only got 2 the baby blue and pink and they weren't even the correct size that I asked for I'm a 38DD and I got a 34D. I'm never buying other items from this company. Now I have to return the bras just to get my money back when I'm in serious need of new bras🤦🏽‍♀️
1.0,"Dejavou Allegedly Super Light, Allegedly Small Capsule Umbrella:  It is much heavier and bigger than it appears in the ad.  It will be a heavy bulky burden in most handbags and other hand carriers.  It has a cloth cover inside the capsule that will never fit back over the umbrella, once you have opened umbrella and closed it, the cover is so tight.  And it is a royal pain to close the umbrella up tight enough to fit back in the capsule itself, even without the inner cloth cover.  The velcro belt that holds the umbrella together when it is closed is poorly sewn and looks like it will soon rip off.  The price is ridiculous - much too high.  Very disappointed!  I paid extra to have this shipped in time for a trip.  There is not enough time to return it. I will discard the silly capsule and the useless cloth cover and try to [[ASIN:B06XZ71KVK Dejavou Super Light Small Mini Folding Capsule Umbrella with Cute Case, Anti Ultraviolet Windproof 5 Folding Travel Pocket Umbrella (Light Blue)]]forget how much money this cost.  Buyer, beware!"
1.0,"It's not cotton, it feels like a sports shirt. I'm definitely not happy with this seeing as I specifically wanted the cotton feel not like I'm going running. There no tags literally anywhere on it, it just arrived in a plastic bag. Not even a tag saying the size."
1.0,Make sure you read the return policy- even if the product is defective your paying
1.0,Looks cute online but it very gaudy and cheaply made in addition to being on a super short chain and the elephant being much smaller than its portrayed online.
1.0,Color is not as pictured....it is a red color not purple/plum
1.0,NO SUPPORT and it does not stay fastened.  I do not recommend for anyone over a size A.  It is soft but that is the only good thing I can say about it.
1.0,"I did not like this earring. Not only was the metal cheap, but when it would twist around in my ear, all the little stones, which we rough around the edges, would cut the inside of my ear. Do not recommend."
1.0,I dislike that it was not what I expected it was supposed to be one piece It fell apart.
1.0,"I bought this umbrella two years ago to keep in the car, but I live in a dry climate and have barely used it. Today I tried to use it, but it won't stay open.  Looking at other reviews, this appears to be a common problem."
1.0,My wife ordered this bra. Here is her review:<br /><br />I'd post a picture but I couldn't get it over my boobs. I got the large that was suppose to fit a 34d and it would fit my 11 year old and I'm a small person anyways. The sizing is terrible off. While The bra is soft there's no way that it would ever fit me and I'm very disappointed. I'm returning mine asap.
1.0,"The bezel on the watch looks convex, but it’s actually flat. It also has a strange shape in the back making it uncomfortable to wear, and not as thin as advertised."
1.0,I had better expectations for this little bag. The fabric is terrible it looks so cheap!!! Nothing like it looks in the picture. Made very poorly. Not happy with it . My daughter really need it for her ongoing ballet and tap classes but this did not work out at all.
1.0,"Initially, the label looked fake to me and I thought it was a knock-of.  But I looked it up and, apparently, Polo has a modern version label that is different than its classic.  The site suggested that you look for manufacturing numbers under the size label when checking for authenticity, and they are there.  I would say for the price, it's ok - it feels like merino, but is very light.  Again, I would expect a genuine Polo to be more luxurious.  This poncho isn't as hoped for or expected."
1.0,The vine part broke off a week after wearing it. I loved the way it looked but I would never buy again. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"Too small, it appears that these garments are European Sizes."
1.0,Nothing like the way it looks like a scarf
1.0,Cheaply made.. cheap material... fits wierd in cheat armpit area... runs really big... im 5”5 138lbs and small was too big... am returning... waste of money
1.0,to big for use on my wife's head
1.0,"So this is for one leaf spring so if you need two order two.  I don't really know what it does because there is no literature included and ARB and the seller are non-responsive.  I guess I could make a cool outdoor rocking chair out of the set I have.  I bought them because I thought I could add them to my stock leaf springs, but that is probably incorrect, I just don't know because there is no technical data.  I don't want to damage my suspension or lose control of my truck so these are wall hangers."
1.0,Cute but didn’t fit properly
1.0,"Would’ve been a great product if they fit. I ordered these thinking they were the same size I had on, definitely not. These are way thicker than the ones I usually wear therefore they serve no purpose for me."
1.0,"I’m a 5’8 tall and medium size when i received it the dress was not as described, thought as the picture it was long to the knee but instead was just above my butt"
1.0,Lights went off
1.0,"Tiny, fits my 2 year old better than my husband"
1.0,This wallet disintegrated and came apart as my husband placed items inside.  We immediately returned it!
1.0,Waist is in a weird place not like pictured- hate the dress don’t buy!
1.0,Good for women and kids but not adult men
1.0,"Doesn't stay as pictured, flips and hangs down! Disappointed...."
1.0,"They are so long in the crotch ( I’m 5’5”) , not Capri length and just a weird fit.. or should I say non- fit!"
1.0,Nunca llegó
1.0,It’s like I’m having an itchy allergic reaction on the top where you tie it up.. even when loosely tied
1.0,"First off, I love the socks! What I didn't love and didn't expect was how long it took me to receive them! I ordered back in November and didn't receive them until February! They were supposed to be a Christmas gift 🤷🏾‍♂️. If you order from this company, double check the delivery schedule!"
1.0,Stones fell out.
1.0,The skirt is for a small child not for a woman as advertised.
1.0,Was way too small and super see through. Unfortunately will get no use out of it.
1.0,These would allow your watch to pop off easily if it where to get snagged on something. No good!
1.0,Seems like I'm ordering from Wish.com instead of amazon.... everything I've ordered lately has been. to small
1.0,Carnival
1.0,"I am so disappointed. Hoping for a sturdy slipper with a good arch. I've worn them for a few days and the heel has totally flattened, and there is no arch support at all."
1.0,Fabric had odor. Didn’t like feel of fabric or fit. Neck was small.
1.0,Was way too small. Very upset about the size because I thought the shirt was cute.
1.0,The Sunglasses are too small for my eyeglasses. I need larger or wider lenses.
1.0,It was about 3 sizes too small.
1.0,It’s not the same as pictured. MUCH less than advertised. Although they offered me half back. No thanks.
1.0,The clasp doesnt open
1.0,Did not look like picture. Material seemed very cheap.
1.0,Fabric was pretty but I did not like the fit. One leg was tighter then the other. Inches from waist to crotch was to short.
1.0,"These dresses had no reviews. I bought them on the strength of my previous purchases. I have bought skirts from Wevez before, I generally like them, even when I did not like the design they were double layered, soft and wearable. These dresses had no lining. The single layered dress is completely see through (see photo). The fabric was very cheap looking and scratchy. The prints were very mismatched and weird, not a single wearable design. To top it off the three dresses were not even the same length. One is about 4 inches longer than the other two. Very disappointed in Wevez, the quality has gone down."
1.0,Returned Item.  Small Fit!!!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:de0cbd8edd908c6d1fefe5e7730c2b44]] The front looks good but I would not buy them, if i were you. Dont waste your money."
1.0,"When I received them they looked dirty, there was black stuff on the front of it, cleaned them but still didn’t work & when I had them on they turned my ears green."
1.0,Bra is great.... if they can send the right size! I have ordered this bra before and decided to order two more. I have now had a total of three bras delivered with only one being the right size. Two bras were tagged as an XL however were actually a XS and a M.
1.0,I don’t like the wait. I am not a Prime member. Must make a difference!
1.0,"Let’s make this brief. WAY too small, not even the colored color. It came fire red. Way too cheap and thin. Total waste of money."
1.0,"Was not the size as described. If you have a large chest, dont even bother."
1.0,"I was hoping this wallet would hold the money in the center space but it can hardly hold any cash.  Because I stuff cash in there, my cards got bent :( I ended up buying another wallet with a magnetic money clip.  I want to return this, it's practically useless for me :("
1.0,"Terrible material, I thought it would be a cotton blend but it's something completely weird. It also smells odd, definitely not wearing it anywhere unless, I decide to paint."
1.0,"The only thing to like about this was the color, I bought the rust one, fabric is....I don’t even know what it was, very thin, limp and I think you would have to iron 1/2 way thru the day because it definitely wasn’t wrinkle resistant, and the sides came down to my hip bones...not a fan of showing off my body when this jumper w/a t-shirt should cover everything but arms and feet"
1.0,Got these to walk the dog and do yard work in.  Tongue ripped out on the fourth day.  Pure garbage.  Didn't even bother to return. Just threw them in the trash.
1.0,It's a constant push and pull. Constantly pulling them up to stay around my waist  leggings will not stay in place.<br />Will not recommend them!
1.0,"The earring does not fit properly.  The top piece/clip is tough to get to adhere, I had to press really hard and my ear ended up sore and uncomfortable.  I wouldn't buy this type of earring again."
1.0,Poorly made. I missed the return window. It looks really fake.
1.0,Its a cute jacket. After reading the reviews I ordered my size thinking it was meant to be oversized. When I recieved the item the tag that lists the size was visably cut out (see 1st pic). Its not as oversized as I was expecting but I'm not really sure if that is due to the cut of the jacket or if I received the incorrect size. I did get a brand ticket the kind that is attached with a string and on the back theres a big S (see pic 2). For small? IDK would be an oversized small but small wasnt the size I ordered. So I have no idea if I should return for a bigger size or return for the same size thats not damaged. Kind of frustrating.<br />Also just a minor fyi the pocket buttons are attached to the flaps and don't actually work for closing the pockets.<br />Update: when I was taking pics for this review I noticed on the bag the jacket came in it is actually listed as a small (see pic 3) So looks to me like somebody cut the tag out and sent me a product 2 sizes smaller than the size I ordered as if I wouldnt notice. Shadey!
1.0,I didn't like it. It doesn't look anything like the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,It said it was pink but when it arrived it was definitely lavender
1.0,"Cheap...cheap...cheap. Plastic material, looks cheap, chose another product. Disappointed."
1.0,I was very disappointed.  The stone came out the first time I wore them. I had to return them.<br /><br />  Thanks
1.0,This would have been a nice ring had the size been true to fit.  Ordered a 10 to fit on my pointer finger.  Only fits my pinky.  And my ring finger size is a 7. Not happy at all.
1.0,Extremely short and small.
1.0,Pure junk. The white beads fell off the earring just as soon as I took them out of the box. Not worth the purchase. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Very short!!  Had to give to my niece because it was so short.  Not worth the money!
1.0,"Omg, this top runs huge! I normally get medium or large, but the size chart suggested ordering up to 2 sizes bigger...I DONT THINK SO!!!! Another clothing item jst sitting in the closet....Unworn!!!"
1.0,i bought this dress in a small its gigantic im going to have it taken in im 5'7 125Ib at most 34D I am a lean person but this is so huge i cant even take a photo it falls off. ill stick to my regular sites for clothing. I am always disappointed.
1.0,Really thin and wrinkles way too easily
1.0,I got them in January wore them maybe 5 times and they have runs in them like pantie hose would.. if I could return them I would but it’s to late..
1.0,The shorts are NOT the material shown! The inseam is wrong and the sizing runs waaaaaay small!
1.0,"Cheaply made flipflops.  I ended up buying a brand name flipflop for cheaper and ended up using my sticky tape for my 3mm lift on my right sandal.  I was looking forward to this without the hassle of my lift but they definitely were not worth the $$.  Also, I wear a size 9 and order size 8 and they were still to big.  So if you really want these I suggest to go a few sizes down."
1.0,I wish I read the reviews! You need to go up 2 sizes! It sucks. A waist of money !
1.0,"If your US size is above a 12, I definitely don't recommend you purchase this blouse. I'm a 10/12, ordered the XL, and it's an uncomfortable fit. The elastic band is low-quality, even for the price. The material is a funky polyester fabric that gets sticky in the warm, temperate Los Angeles, California climate.  I could've purchased an off the shoulder blouse from my local City Target and it would've cost less and made better. I will not purchase any more items from this retailer in the future. This did not look like the picture, and while my daughter is smaller than I am, she tried it on with no aesthetic improvement whatsoever."
1.0,This will keep rolling down
1.0,I'm sure I would have been very happy with the Russell ball cap ....if would have just arrived.  No refund  - very disappointed.
1.0,My wife was disappointed it looks nothing and material is real cheap
1.0,Fabric is paper thin....more like plastic wrap. Sizing is also off. Total rip for $17. I wish Amazon didn't have such retailers
1.0,These are listed as cropped and they are NOT!!  Long...  would be cute cropped. Oh well.
1.0,Ordered a 2x for myself and my sister who is a small could barely fit them. Don't waste your money
1.0,"Description says they are one size fits all, and the product packaging says size 7-11 men's. I wear a size 7 women's, and my feet swim in these."
1.0,"Ordered one jacket and recieved one as a gift. The two jackets were of very different quality.  I ordered an XL but the two jackets received were labeled XXL and 3XL. Even so both were tighter in the body than expected. One jacket was of very poor construction quality: one sleeve was shorter than the other, the inside label was crooked and partially sewn into the seam, and the main zipper was installed upside down. The other jacket was better but also had quality issues such as a missing pull tab to tighten the left side of the hood."
1.0,A little windy will blow away.
1.0,These run extremely small and were not that well padded.  I returned them.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:741343eb260f03307edcf90c67da28fd]] El zapato se me ha despegado y no lo he podido volver a utilizar.<br /><br />Los zapatos tienen garantía ?
1.0,Ok product but in my personal opinion the quality of the hat is not up to a 30 doller hat. I owned a few 30 to 40 dollar hats and it dosent compared.
1.0,"I loved the look of this top online and i was so excited for it to arrive. And then it did... I was very disappointed. The colors are different in person, the grey is much lighter, almost washed out, the tan is a weird brown and the coral/orange color is too orange. It looks and feels very cheap. The material feels itchy against my skin. Fit wise it’s okay, a large is a large but it’s shorter than it looks. I’m short anyway (5’3) and it comes to the top of my jeans. It’s definitely lightweight, practically see through. I was truly bummed."
1.0,Xl didn’t fit me like almost all bands xl does.
1.0,Once again I bought something and a part was missing and it to was poor quality.MY Coupon organizer also was missing the calculator and it was a cheap item!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"It's BROKEN! No stars. Very disappointed. Not n only was it delivered late, the glass face is shattered!"
1.0,"I purchase this cover to use in for a garden party in June.  I did not open it until a couple of days before needing it (my mistake).  I did measure the ribs to the center.  Based on the information, I felt confident that this was the correct item.  Trying to put in on, was difficult from the beginning.  The hole that was cut in the material was very small, so I had to cut it.  But there was no guide lines to help make the cut circular (or stitching reinforcement). After getting the cover when over the center point, I found the cover was too small.  I probably would have needed about another 1 1/2  to 2 inches to make it fit.  I was disappointed, but thought that the lack of a fit, was due to the design of my umbrella.  I was will to accept that the company could not be responsible for this..I thought that I would be able to make adjustments and get it to work.<br />  I quickly changed my mine about making the effort to fix the fit.  This is because the cover began to fade almost immediately.  I chose this cover because of the 'fade resistant features' advertised.  In less than one week, the umbrella cover went from bright green to a very drab khaki green.  This was not the least expensive option available, but I chose it thinking that the color would last.  The original cover on my umbrella barely faded in more than 7 years...it just got tattered.  I would definitely suggest that you consider another company before buying this cover."
1.0,"It wasn't what I wanted at all.  It looked cheap. Came in too small and some were bent up, but it was just too much effort to send them back.  I can probably still use most of them for something."
1.0,Waaaayyyy too big for my wrists. Returned the set!
1.0,"THE FIRST DAY WE WORE THE RINGS, TWO OF THE STONES FELL OUT.  WE BOUGHT 5 RINGS TO HELP US THROUGH GOING THROUGH OUR SISTER/MOTHERS BELONGINGS AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY IN THE HOPES IT WOULD LIFT OUR MOODS.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY."
1.0,"Loved these sunglasses however, they broke within the first day of having them. Not great for a preschooler."
1.0,To sheer
1.0,"Horrible! A rip-off! They are made of a shiny thick synthetic fabric and have a solid plastic strip that you insert in a pocket to hold the shape over your mouth. So you can’t breathe well & the plastic would muffle your sound as well as making it extremely hot to wear. Also, the listed price is for 1 mask but they charged me for 6, saying that was a minimum order.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon refunded me the cost."
1.0,Horrible quality with strings hanging everywhere and a quick sewing job.
1.0,WAY too small and I really do not like the fabric.
1.0,Great looking goggles but leaked every time I wore them. I gave them to my Marathon swimming niece & they leaked on her also.  Sad they didn’t work.
1.0,"I was very disappointed by this product. I bought these to take to the lake for my daughter to protect her feet from the rocks, but the soles are paper thin. She put them on and immediately tried them out by walking across our lawn. She said that she could feel every blade of grass under her feet. I feel that they are useless and I don't understand how they could actually be functional, as they don't offer any protection! We had to order a different brand last minute, and unfortunately, I learned that this product is not returnable. This product should not say &#34;durable&#34; in the title, as I could foresee a hole in the sole within the first day of use! Very frustrating."
1.0,No. Returning mine.
1.0,After one wash the material was coming apart! Very dissatisfied.
1.0,Received a totally different hat. Still Vans brand but nothing like the one pictured in any way.
1.0,The stone DOES NOT SPARKLE at all..... It is very comfortable to wear but looks dull and unattractive from the moment I opened the package.
1.0,"I received 2 pair, one pink one and one black one for each of my kids. They have been used for about 1 month. All four clips have started fraying along the entire side, and the clips sometimes fall off either the coat or the glove. I'm always on the look out for a dropped mitten. Luckily my littles are old enough to tell me if one falls off. Aren't these clips supposed to prevent that from happening?"
1.0,It broke the second day I used it. Nissan symbol fell off....could not find. So disappointed.
1.0,Too small and poor quality
1.0,"You can barely make out the heart at the top, and the bottom does not curve or show hook. There is no indication that this is a semicolon.  Very bad mold. I would advise anyone looking for the mental health/suicide awareness symbol ring not to purchase this item!"
1.0,Very disappointed. Looked more like copper than gold. Returned
1.0,The charm turned my skin green and the bracelet ties come undone very easily
1.0,"Horrible, in no way are these safe for tattooing. Extremely thin."
1.0,I like the cut and fabric. The size is more of a smedium rather than a medium. I am four months postpartum and I need tops that look nice. I purchased a 3/4 sleve from the same company in a small and it looks nice. I will be returning this shirt.
1.0,I have purchased hundreds of items over the years at Amazon. I rarely write reviews and don't recall ever writing a negative review. This product I found after trying them in different conditions and taking sensible precautions to be very close to worthless. Buyer beware.
1.0,The lighter part that connects to the lighter get very hot. It dangerous.
1.0,Came broken. The box is okay but the glasses are in peices.
1.0,When they arrived I knew they were way to small.  Probably would work for a child.
1.0,HORRIBLE product. Super cheap and 100% DO NOT reccomend.
1.0,"Items were of very poor quality, so I returned them."
1.0,"I have had to have the band fixed twice in the short time I have used it.  It is very nice looking and does not appear to be flimsy, but the connections to the fitbit aren't sturdy and have broken on me twice."
1.0,It was not the right size
1.0,It smelled like perfume as if its been worn. Omg
1.0,I'll give one star for the one that hatched and lived.....
1.0,"Very thin. TOO thin. Could not see anyone wearing this anywhere, including the gym. Do yourself a favor and pass."
1.0,"This &#34;Wrap&#34; as presented by the selling merchant is a &#34;RAG&#34; and not a very good &#34;RAG&#34; at That !!! $20.00 gone down the drain, but maybe I can use it to polish wipe my car ?"
1.0,Had to return. Looks a lot different than the picture
1.0,"Looks like nothing like picture. I am very disappointed in this Allegra K Flower shirt.<br />Lenght is shorter, than appears in picture ... and the style looks so different.<br />I think it could be because her hands are cross in front so you can't see the<br />style of the shirt.<br />Also, didn't like how it fit. Fit larger / looser than expected. Wasted my money. Will never wear."
1.0,This wasn't true to size at all and cheap material. The sleeves were much longer than pictured and the sizing was very off. I returned it immediately.
1.0,I bought this pant due to the pocket.  My cell phone would not fit in it or much of anything else for that matter. I sent it back
1.0,One of the sides fell off within few days. Cheaply made. Not worth the money.
1.0,"Cup size is way too small. Not at all what it should be if accurate, literally spilled out the top."
1.0,Wore once and others found holes in the seams. Mended the holes and washed and it got worse. I liked it but wish I woulda saved my money...
1.0,I ordered 2 rottweiller socks.  One was rottweiller and the other was St. Bernard.  Quality was not what I thought it would be for the price.
1.0,"Horrible fit for even slightly curvy women. This is for very thin, petite women."
1.0,These are way smaller than what I was expecting. They're such a weird size.
1.0,Don’t buy. Cheap fabric. The butterflies are not embroidered they are printed and peeling.
1.0,I can't even get my foot in these socks
1.0,"Purchased for a fun holiday party, unfortunately they did not hold up and some of the plastic started breaking right away. Save your money!"
1.0,Very thin cheaply made metal
1.0,Extra large fits more like an extra small.
1.0,"Not only did they get here later than expected, they are bent I want to return them and I'm pretty bummed about it"
1.0,I wish I had never bought this.  The fit is horrid for me. It cannot stay on my face as the strap angle is so weird that it pulls the mask straight down and off my face.
1.0,"Was looking for a replacement to the Matt Foley aviators, this is not close. Frame feels like ceramic against the skin, and don’t seem nearly as durable."
1.0,Way too small and short
1.0,My daughter purchased this why I don't know but it came broken so threw it in the garage. Pretty sure it took a long time to arrive so long forgot about it but didn't cost much so lesson learned
1.0,No compression at all. Good as a regular tank.
1.0,Cheep garbage didn't last a full week. Ripped right from the top all the way down the back and inside you cam see just random pieces of fabric sewn onto the inside. Very  poor quality
1.0,Came broken. Very cheap look.
1.0,"I’m not sure if it’s the product or my little guy, but these were not great. I was hoping for something that would fit more snuggly to his head to help keep his glasses in place. These def hang off the back of his head. We played around with placement on the glasses, but they slid around the arms a lot and were really thick behind his ears."
1.0,"Not sheer, not flattering, not as advertised."
1.0,I wish i cangive -10 on this product it dies explain that it is only for adult sizes. The return postageti China is cost more than the product . What a waste of money
1.0,"Sizing is way off, I purchased a medium and it fits more like extra small...."
1.0,These masks are worthless. There is a thin strip that you are supposed to pinch to make the mask conform to your nose-the glue used on the strip has less adhesive power than a post-it note. Consequently you pinch it and it comes off. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"When i first wore it it was great, but the second time it would not release.  I like the design hate the engineering."
1.0,One shoe led light is not working..
1.0,These are NOT mri safe they do contain medal in the tip. Tip is also very lose on half of them. My mri is tomorrow so no time to order new I’m going to just have to suck it up and us half of this stud and hope it doesn’t fall out.
1.0,"I was so excited when I received this item. It was what I was looking for in a mask, especially how light weight it was. Wore it once and the threading began to unravel. I had to restitch it. Very disappointing."
1.0,I actually got my purse and it broke two days later the strap came off and I was very upset because I was excited to have gotten it
1.0,"Poorly made, broke in 1-2 weeks."
1.0,"I disliked the fact that its listed as anti-rip, which it's not.  I use these to suits to help lose weight."
1.0,The body of this dress fit perfectly but the sleeves were so baggy It looked stupid.. and I assure you I have normal arms 😂 it’s a shame because this dress had potential but the sleeve don’t look anything like ones on the dress that the model is wearing.
1.0,"The product description explicitly states that this is a replacement lens for the Bollé Edge 2 sport glasses. I purchased both the emerald and the blue replacement lens. Please be aware that it DOES NOT fit the Bollé Edge 2 frame. The lens is too wide. Other than that, they seem to be a nice replacement lens for something else."
1.0,So small way too short sleeves.
1.0,One of the eye glass flaps does not stay in an upright position.  It continually flops downward making it worthless.
1.0,I order 2 40 Pcs sets. When they arrive not only were there only 30 in each set but another 10 in each set did not work....pay for what you get I suppose.
1.0,"Too small, doesn't even fit my child properly. It's made of terrible material and I would not recommend this to anyone ever!"
1.0,Too short. Skimmed on material.
1.0,One of the stones on the side of ring fell out a d very visible. Threw ring in garbage.
1.0,"Very disappointed. The shirt was adorable, awesome material but was tiny. Purchased as gift for my sister. 5.6 maybe 120lbs 36c  too small especially in the sleeves. Didn't come in larger size had to return. :("
1.0,"Couldn't get the button to depress to open. Ended up using pliers. After using the pliers repeatedly I was able to open it by hand, but then in the first rain storm it wouldn't open again."
1.0,"Can’t get it over my head. Yes, I have a large head but geez Louise I can barely get it over my 4 year olds head"
1.0,Not of the small order fit
1.0,Don't stay in position against the shell of your ear.
1.0,"Big dissapointment, the watch was running to fast, 4 seconds faster every minut, 4 minutes faster every hour, aprox 90 minutes faster per day. I send it back and instead of 544$, I receive 540$."
1.0,color was not as expected and shown on line.
1.0,A bad photo copy type. Disappointed
1.0,Necklace way to short like a choker n keept falling off the pendant its self it is quite annoying
1.0,"This dress was very misshaped. The sleeves were tight and baggy. The skirt<br />Part of the dress was in 3 layers. The top layer was loose, the middle layer was tight and the bottom layer was loose. It was weird."
1.0,Very cheap looking. Looks like the rings you get out of those quarter machines at the grocery store in those plastic balls.
1.0,"If I would have gotten the size I ordered they would be great, but I got a size smaller than I ordered.🤷🏻‍♀️"
1.0,Too small and too short. Cheap fabric.
1.0,Beautiful bling.  Worth every dime.
1.0,Horrible. Beads were nice but I bought 3 bracelets and all three broke the first time worn.
1.0,The sweater was use not new it had food stains.I was upset but my son did not wanted to send it back . We washed.
1.0,Beautiful piece except it was broken when it arrived. The clasp was broken and the 2 stones were missing. The purple one arrived in beautiful condition.
1.0,My package was delivered open and there was nothing in it super dissapointed
1.0,"This case is VERY cheaply made. Be very careful while using the clip. Used the case one time, fortunately I felt the case hit the back of my legs as I was walking down the path, otherwise I would have lost my glasses. I didn’t expect much, this product has met my low expectations and surpassed them."
1.0,I’m extremely disappointed with the product..I only washed it 2 times (both times with cold water) and it ended up faded at heck..as if I owned it for years..this is ridiculous...don’t waste your money
1.0,The chain is not the one shown in the picture. It was a very thin ribbon chain. It looks like it would easily break. When I spoke to a representative I told him I wanted something more durable for everyday wear. He said it would take five weeks to order and I would be better off buying one from someone else. I told him I would wait five weeks but still would not help me. He continued to tell me to buy one elsewhere. I should have sent the whole thing back for a refund but my girlfriend loved the stone. It was a birthday gift and I didn’t want to disappoint her so I just bought a chain from another retailer! I was not trying to get something for free. I offered to pay for the chain I wanted but he just blew me off!!! So much for satisfaction guaranteed! I won’t be buying anything from this seller again!!!!!
1.0,"2nd one ordered. 1st came without pins. 2and one pins bent. Piece of crap. Amazon didn't offer replacement pins, item came from China. BEWARE ALL PRODUCTS FROM CHINA. A TOTAL WASTE"
1.0,To tiny
1.0,"I originally bought this sweater in black and loved it, so I bought another in red. The four was tighter than the black for the same size but not so much that I couldn't wear it. Though, after the first wash, one sleeve came completely undone. So now I have a useless pile of fabric unless I can find the time to fix it.<br /><br />I accept the risk of buying cheaper items but thought I'd get at least a few more wears out of it!"
1.0,isn't anything like the picture
1.0,"I ordered this shirt that was size &#34;5-6 years.&#34; My son is 5, tall and very thin and when he tried it on it's more of like a 2-3 T size. Very disappointed."
1.0,This is a really cute t-shirt. Falsely advertised as a sweatshirt though🙁
1.0,Way to big and I always wear a medium
1.0,"I where a 34 in the waist , these shorts are slim fit, so they don't fit.<br />So gave them away, I'll just stick to ordering electronics and shoes, no more shorts."
1.0,I only receive the tip how must I wear this without the bottom piss off
1.0,Great Grandson loves Paw Patrol
1.0,I have short hair and wear CPAP. I wanted this to keep my hair in place at night and CPAP mask would not pull my hair. Well all this cap did was smash my hair down against my scalp making it impossible to comb my hair in the morning. I had to wash my hair again in order for my hair to look good. Would not recommend at all.<br />Cant send it back as I wore it for a week hoping it would be beneficial but instead just a waste of my money.
1.0,"The print for the Super Hero Girls is perfect. Everything else - not so much, The material is see-through - how is this supposed to protect my child? One of the elastic bands was torn upon opening the package. The stitching is shoddy."
1.0,"This was not a good deal, it took ten days to arrive and you can get the same product at half the price from another retailer. My mistake, it won't happen again."
1.0,did not look like the picture . Broke the first day. It rain that day. The thing came apart .Was a waste
1.0,Earmuffs are very large / not good for small heads. Band does not fit snug around head due to it being much oversized. Returned product.
1.0,The length is great buy material is so thin. And sizing is way way off
1.0,"Worn this bra a handful of times, underwire already popped out. 1 week too late to return."
1.0,Poorly made product!! I got this for my 11 year old niece. The elastic on one ear loop was cut in half and seem poorly back together. Don't waste your money.
1.0,No instructions were provided when delivered and once I did figure out how to print pictures thanks to google the plastic covers wouldn’t stay in place they kept popping off. I will be returning so frustrating. Save your time and money buy elsewhere.
1.0,"This product is absolutely stunning in and out of the box.  My only issue is that I bought these for a photo shoot on the beach and 30 minutes through one of them broke.  So, I basically got 30 minutes of use out of them."
1.0,don't be fooled. these are NOT leather. they are a suede like hard fabric. NOT what is described. very disappointed.
1.0,"I purchased this for my wife. it took over 3 weeks (not the issue as I expected that), but when we got it, the fitment was terrible. way to large and not well designed (fitment wise). i requested a return on 3/29/19, the seller Angashion same day and asked for a summary of the issue, i replied a couple days later 4/2/19, and its 4/18/19 now and I have not heard from them since."
1.0,Extremely dissatisfied! Three worthless watches to use. Came with the batteries dead and unable to open the back to change battery myself. Ordered these in order to use next week. Just more stuff to throw on my junk drawer.
1.0,"The color is not printed well on the sweater, very sad, this was my daughter's bday present.  The red looks light pale orange..and the white outline is extremely light."
1.0,"Edge of the jewelry, the part that goes threw the piercing was rough not rounded like normal body jewelry. I probably could have gotten past that part if a rhinestone hadn't fallen out almost immediately."
1.0,The hem was off the fabric was very very thin
1.0,I NEEDED MY IDEM RUSH SHIPPED. I ORDERED IT ON FRIDAY 12/16/2011 AND I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD GOT IT BY 12/23/2011 AND NEVER GOT IT. IN THE END I NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK AND I HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER IDEM ASAP.(WHICH CAUSED ME MORE MONEY!) DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN  WEST COAST JEWELRY!
1.0,Awful shoe
1.0,"Watch band came in wrong size. I have a Samsung Gear 2Neo which this band was supposed to fit according to the item description, also one of the pictures shown is of my watch but the item is too small. I have returned the item and purchased another band from another seller and hopefully that one comes in correct size."
1.0,this was a rubber skin not full body protection with screen protector didnt have that either. returned
1.0,I purchased this for my boyfriend. After about 2 weeks it stopped working. Please mind that he has owned a few mechanical watches and has never had a problem. We contacted the seller and got a replacement. It's been about 2 months and this watch has stopped working completely. We can no longer return the watch and stuck with it. I would not recommend unless you don't mind having a broken watch.
1.0,They don’t look like the picture. Don’t like them.
1.0,Not remotely like the photos. Such cheap fabric. Returned immediately
1.0,Super small and missing buttons. Don’t waste your money or time.
1.0,Tooo heavy - will not stay on
1.0,Major shrinkage to a child age 6 socks when washed. It now fits my son and on the small size for him. I only wore it once 😞 and washed it and it had major shrinkage 🤯😭
1.0,"UGH! Unless you have very small breasts and no side boobm you will be fine. If you have larger breasts, this bra will not work. It squishes them up in a weird way that looks unnatural. I thin kthat's why the model has her arms crossed because its the underarm and side part that looks weird. Not good."
1.0,"Three sizes to small, from listed size"
1.0,These shoes fell apart after the first wear. Yes they are adorable and the fit was perfect but I would suggest to pick a different pair of shoes. I had to throw them away after my daughter wore them for 3 hours in a wedding.
1.0,"The top is ugly! It’s a tight crop top in front and a very long and loose shirt in the back that passes your butt. It reminded me of a tuxedo jacket with tails (that extreme). You open your arms and you have flaps are awful by design because of the cut and obvious seems. A dolman cut would have improved this.  Poor construction, poor design and I’m the dummy who let the return pass me by. In the garbage it goes because I don’t think anyone should wear this. I’m bummed that I’ve been too busy and threw money away."
1.0,The cuffs  and waistband was sewn backwards rough side on the outside
1.0,this product is not made in the U.S. so the sizes they offer are too small. i felt like i was wearing a childs 11.5
1.0,This top was not the same as picture. It was supposed to be a light waffle fabric and was not even close!
1.0,They run a little small. I normally wear large but should have went with an extra large on this one. After the first wash it basically fell apart
1.0,I should have payed more attention to the reviews pointing out that the idea of a &#34;one size fits all&#34; head garment is flawed. I ended up having to pay return postage for this thing and the company I purchased it from will charge a 15% restocking fee on top of that! How annoying!
1.0,Fell apart first use.
1.0,"While my 5 yo son loves these, they don’t hold their form well, faded on the first was - and continue with each subsequent. On the shirt, the red fades into the white giving it an overall dingy look. I likely will never buy from company again- even if just for  photo op."
1.0,This top is is sewed wrong. Its super baggy with extra material in front and more fit in back. If i were 8 months preg it would fit... thats how much extra material there is... and No its not a maternity shirt.
1.0,For a size 10 and up this is too small.
1.0,I ordered a 3X and got a small. Buyer beware
1.0,"The hose adapter broke the first time I used it.  After connecting the adapter to the air pump and attempting to attach the air needle the hose came off the metal adapter, leaving it inside the air pump.<br />It took me a some time to remove the metal from the air pump."
1.0,"If I received a six piece necklace, it would have been lovely but we only got a 4 piece necklace.  My daughter was unable to give these to her friends because she needed all six pieces.  A waste of her money!"
1.0,Came with dog hair and stains
1.0,Dog not cat- returned it for a refunz
1.0,This scarf is small. I thought it'd be fuller. Disappointed.
1.0,"I was looking for actual Devil Horns Hand sign charms! This one is not! It is I love you hand sign. It would have been perfect but nooo! It wasn't, it was a lie!"
1.0,Made very cheaply.  Not as nice as it looked in your picture
1.0,Not hypoallergenic material broke my ear out and made it super sore. I have warn many other pairs and didn’t have this happen. Not happy
1.0,Zipper broke before I could even ware it. It's beautiful but made cheap
1.0,"Cheap, returned."
1.0,Don't waste your time and money on this product. It is trash.
1.0,"Poor quality. Looks and feels cheap, which it need not do, as many less expensive watches more than hold their own. I returned it immediately."
1.0,Pictures are not same as product
1.0,Super disappointed.<br /><br />I though Valentino was supposed to be a higher end brand.<br /><br />Bag arrived & I don't think it was adequately packages. The chain straps were scratching the &#34;leather&#34;. It seemed like fake leather.<br /><br />The bottom of the purse was scratched up as well.<br /><br />I returned it ASAP.
1.0,"Broke, stone lost in less than an hour of first wear. Total crap"
1.0,"My daughter is five, these masks barely went over her head and was so tight aginst her nose and mouth it would have literally suffocated her. To put into perspective they fit her dolls so shes been using them for that 🤷‍♀️ dont waste your money."
1.0,This fits like a second skin.  I love the look in the picture but it is nothing like that.  Very disappointed.
1.0,The sizes run super small.  More like youth sizes.
1.0,They did not fit my ears. The bar was too thick. I’m very disappointed because they are so cute in person.
1.0,"These were stylish like my daughter wanted, but they did not hold up over time and aren't great quality. Keep shopping moms."
1.0,"Very disappointed. It's too small for my 8 year old, the quality sucks, the material is terrible. 0/10 don't waste your money"
1.0,The description says 1inch and the pictures show dainty earrings. What I received were monstrously big haha. I wish I could have received the right size because the quality seemed nice. Instead I had to make a trip to return them in this mess of a quarantine.
1.0,"Do not get me wrong, these petti pants are made out of quality material and are well made, I would like to point that out first.......but.......the sizing leaves a lot to be desired.  The Size Large and Extra Large are the equivalent of US Extra Small, which leaves me to wonder who fits the actual small size as these are adult garments and not baby clothes."
1.0,Case is way too big and slips out of may hand way too easy. Really not a fan.
1.0,Quality bad... cheap
1.0,They have a bad smell to them! And got runners in a the first time I wore them...
1.0,"Gross material, terrible design, overall ugly and uncomfortable."
1.0,I received this item and it was crushed in the box
1.0,"very disappointed only had it for 2 weeks and keep noticing it was not keeping up with the current time, slow battery or maybe the fault is with the watch itself. could not find any information on how to purchase another battery anyway."
1.0,I didn't get too wear it because the ball was on so tight nothing worked to get it off.
1.0,"Sadly disappointed.... product description states 2.9 x 2.7 x 1 inches when in reality it’s diameter is less then a quarter as is its height. You can fit a tooth in here for sure, but don’t expect to fit any money or “gift” from the Tooth Fairy in return.<br /><br />I can’t imagine trying to find this under my child’s pillow either, because it’s so small."
1.0,ANOTHER MASK THAT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD REAL RHINE STONES AND DID NOT. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN
1.0,I received a completely different product. I received a high-low dress and the material is different than all the rest of the reviews. The item I received was see through and not flowy like all the rest of the customer images.
1.0,Clon
1.0,"Sheds SO MUCH , I was going to return it but missed the time frame"
1.0,"I got this to use on my Oculus Quest 2 lenses because the lens fog up so much during a workout.  The spray is too wide and sprays beyond the lens, even when I place the sprayer right at the lens in an attempt to not get the inside of the headset.  Also, when working out more than 15 minutes, the lens fog up even after spraying immediately before the workout.  This is the same when not using the spray, so the spray doesn't work at all, or at most gives an extra 5 minutes before fogging up. The bottle was half full when it arrived because it leaked in the box."
1.0,One side does not fit the oakley frames. The other side fits ok but is “squeaky” in the frame. Got a 2nd set to try but they are even worse. Definitely not a frame issue as i have 2 other sets of old/scratched lenses that fit well.<br />Update: Different brand fit like a glove.
1.0,Disliked it when put on it did not look like I had a bra on. And the sticky stuff irritated my skin. Leaving red itchy blotches.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. Normally wear a women’s 4 so I ordered a small. It was way too lose.
1.0,"Poorly made.  Not looking like the picture. Has no shape, very short.  Buyers be aware."
1.0,Bought this in Army green and really dislike the fabric. It is a polyester type material and with the ribbed sleeves the top feels funny just over my elbow. Disappointed and I'm returning this tomorrow.
1.0,I purchased as a gift.  This medium size wasn't true to size - actually too small.  The qualify wasn't good.
1.0,Too small. Sad about this.
1.0,Paws on the bottom of the scarf arrived glued together.  Ears are floppy and round shaped - not very catlike.  Fur is soft but not very thick or fluffy.  Item was returned.
1.0,"Unfortunately the size did not reflect the normal sizes that I’m used to. When it says medium, it’s not like a very small!"
1.0,"As another buyer pointed out, the quality is low and they fall apart quickly. These lasted me about a month, if that, before the bottom of the right boot just started falling off. I bought these in December and by January they had fallen apart. I wasn't wearing them daily either. They didn't even last the season. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Absolute garbage, broke only TWO DAYS after I gave it to my boyfriend. Save your money; I want my money back!"
1.0,"I had a different brand of night driving glasses that I loved. Bought these as a replacement and they do absolutely nothing to reduce the glare and help me see in night time driving conditions. Nice looking glasses, but worthless."
1.0,"Disappointed, the color on the cow print if coming off. Not what I expected."
1.0,"Sorry, don't do it. Even if there were enough for both shoes, they started breaking as I was installing them."
1.0,"The glasses themselves are good for the price. Nothing fancy but gets the job done. However, the screws fell out of the frames after a week of use, and the screw size is not standard, so you can’t fix them with a repair kit. Very disappointing."
1.0,"This is NOT a good color to purchase. I own like 10 pairs of these in dark colors that I love! I wear them to workout almost every day. This color is VERY unflattering and mostly see-through. I'm 5'4&#34; and 122lbs, very athletic. I should not have a problem with the way pants look on me but these were a problem for sure.  I plan on returning."
1.0,This is way to big!!! Not a slim fit at all
1.0,"Unfortunately it fit me too big, I didn’t get to use it"
1.0,Couldn't fit runs small
1.0,"Did not work as it came out of the box. Save your money or get the ones from Macy’s, they are better quality and there is a years warranty"
1.0,Did not realize it was the Browns instead of the Broncos 🤣
1.0,"I don't understand why these are on my review list. Yes, I purchased these but I also returned them un-opened, never tried them. I also ordered less pressured ones at the same time and since those worked fine and were difficult enough to put on, I simply returned these. My other pairs of Go2Socks (16-22) worked great."
1.0,"I got this dress in white and it is completely see through. It's very pretty, but i'll never be able to actually wear it out, so it doesn't really matter if it's pretty."
1.0,Says 2 pack. Only shipped 1
1.0,I am very disappointed that this band does not fit my Fitbit Surge... looking for replacement or refund.
1.0,Terrible product.  Flowers started falling off immediately and hot glue all over product.  It looked like a 12 year olds sad attempt.
1.0,Didn't fit at all
1.0,"Soo small! they look oval here, right? they are teeny tiny round.. awful bad representation."
1.0,I received them I open the package two of them where broken they went direct to the garbage is not the price because I order two other set and they're fine.
1.0,Basically an adult hat- it’s huge no way it fits a 1 Yo
1.0,"The material was very light and flimsy, not at all a ""winter"" coat. The size measurements were completely off, very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Too small. Did not fit or stick as advertised
1.0,"The neck is too tight, torso too long, and shoulders fit weird."
1.0,"First off, this seller has a lot of gall to put a photo of the glasses that does not match the actual item delivered (whether or not either set of glasses resemble the one Agent Smith wore is another issue).<br /><br />Now, I was not expecting a high quality replica, it's twenty bucks, but I at least wanted to receive the item depicted on the sales listing.<br /><br />Noticeable differences:<br /><br />1)the nose piece looks very different, and is not attached to the glases frames/lenses by brackets, as depicted.<br /><br />2)The glasses are cheaply and shoddily mirrored, rather than being tinted dark, as depicted.<br /><br />3)the ear pieces are rounded, not squared off.<br /><br />4)the frame is thinner than depicted, particularly in the ear piece area.<br /><br />5)the ear pieces do not attach to the lenses in the manner shown in the photograph, rather, there is a single cheap looking bracket.<br /><br />All in all, the glasses bear a resemblance to the photo, but are NOT THE SAME."
1.0,Not like picture.  Big piece of crappy lace sewn and cut poorly.
1.0,Order cancelled. Didn't pass thu customs
1.0,not practice
1.0,Too big and broke within a month.
1.0,"Material wasn’t good, not mustard but bright yellow color not oversized for a plus size person just a little baggy"
1.0,"These are the most flimsy glasses, but they were a total steal on price.  I would not buy them."
1.0,"After a long wait my replica arrived today in the state seen in my pictures. I am very disappointed with the item and the company.  This was bought for collectors purposes and is worthless and the damage is disgraceful.  Don't buy from this company if I could give 0 stars I would. Amazon, why are you allowing trade like this on your site?"
1.0,Fell apart in the wash
1.0,very inferior. looks different from what is displayed here. the only reason i'm not returning it is because it's just $8 plus i dont have time priint out label to drop off. DONT BUY!!!
1.0,Not very happy it turn a different color and it broke in the chain I will never by another product from them again
1.0,Came broke. No way to wear the earrings missing hook or whatever it’s called to wear through your ear.
1.0,"It broke less than a week after I got it. It was also very uncomfortable to wear and would always twist and hurt my piercing area. I didn’t wear it in the shower or to sleep, and it still broke very quickly. I would not recommend."
1.0,Not at ALL what it is supposed to be. Very deceiving. I paid for a bangle bracelet I got a stretchy snake that isn't even a bracelet. Very disappointed and will be asking for refund.
1.0,Everything broken upon arrival
1.0,Sooooooooooo thin
1.0,Thin and very cheap feeling.  Horrible
1.0,"Small, cheap material."
1.0,The color was pretty but it was such low quality and ratchet . It was like a Halloween costume and I was very disappointed. If you have one stretch mark it will show up thru the dress. If you have a perfect and fit body then it’s perfect for you lol
1.0,too small for an adult or teen to wear?!?!?
1.0,Poor quality does not give when you move.
1.0,After wearing for about a week the whole thing is tarnished. I had such high hopes for this necklace but I can no long wear it.
1.0,This item was nothing like I expected. My sister ordered one and it was stunning. I am going to see where hers came from and reorder. This was cheap and ran too small. The quality of the one my sister ordered was exceptional.
1.0,This product did not work for me
1.0,👎🏽
1.0,"My mother needed a new watch, she likes men's watches because they are easier to read<br />Unfortunately this watch arrived deader than Jimmy Hoffa<br />It looks nice but it kind of defeats the purpose if the battery is dead.<br />Not even worth the hassle of returning because they probably all have dead batteries.  This is an issue the seller should keep an eye out for."
1.0,"Poor fit! Would have returned it, but washed it before returning trying it on my daughter."
1.0,Too small and It was a large.  I usually wear a medium.  It is a shear fabric.  So would need a cami.
1.0,There are NOT all 26 letters in here !
1.0,Cheesy horrible cheap fabric!!! I'm sorry but this was by far the worst craftsmanship.<br />Don't Buy!!! I made an A-line skirt in Jr. High school home economics class that looked better. NO LIE!
1.0,It broke before I use. Was not happy about because I was very excited to use it
1.0,Not as cute as the picture
1.0,The size on this might have been an extra large for a child size.  It was absurd how inaccurate the size was.
1.0,"Bad quality fabric, not worth the long wait for delivery."
1.0,It came on time but wth? It doesnt fasten!!!!!!! I thought it came as a fastened band like in the picture that you can adjust but theres no way for you to fasten it and its itchy tight and uncomfortable. I stapled it and it does the job but its not as stylish as i thought
1.0,I truly am saddened that these didn’t meet my expectations not only once but twice… I ordered the first pair because they fit my style completely and look darling in the photos…..when I received them they were so stretched out they would not stay on my face and crooked. So I returned them for a replacement the second pair arrived and weren’t nearly as bad but still over stretched and slightly crooked. I love sojo’s and will still be a loyal customer. These cute sun glasses just did not meet their typical great quality products.
1.0,"Cheap, bulky and scratchy sweater material!  YUCK"
1.0,Wrong item was sent
1.0,Cute but bends extremely easy! Maybe lead?
1.0,"Garbage I would not recommend this at alllVery tin you can see through it. The top and bottom was just cut buy a scissors and never stich just left plain like that, very dissatisfied."
1.0,"I bought a medium so it’s kinda of loose but not sloppy looking. (For a family cabin trip) The shorts are okay, not tight around the waist but the top sucks. It’s too small to be concerned a medium, it’s short. I do have a larger-ish chest so I wore a sports bra to try the top on and it still sucks. Not comfy at all, I’m to concerned with the top going up. Not jazzed."
1.0,These are NOT all stainless steel - the smallest one was fine but I had an awful allergic reaction to the blue one and haven’t even bothered with the others because it’s not worth it. Don’t waste your money if you’re looking for hypoallergenic options.
1.0,This is just poor quality.  I have several Mission items - this is not the quality that was expected.
1.0,It's really cute but after you wear it for a day it turns your finger green and the rings turn to a rusty color
1.0,Returning this shoe because they are not clear on sizing. My son's true size is a 5/US. I bought him a 6.5. It fits the same as his 5/US.
1.0,Just ok wouldn’t buy again
1.0,This quality wasn’t the one I expected.
1.0,"I bought it because it was the cheapest one on Amazon!  Bad move! Will I EVER learn that lesson?!?!  It's obvious when you open the package that this is a cheapie.  First off, this is a plastic band, not a silicone one.  The edges that meet the watch are not straight (defects in the molding).  Also, there are supposed to be &#34;barbs&#34; on both pieces that snap into detentes on the watch body and hold it in place, as well as the two screws on each piece.  The lower band has no barbs at all, and the barbs on the upper band are malformed little bumps -- again, poor injection molding. Fortunately, all I needed from the kit was the buckle, which I removed and placed on my original Fitbit band.  I also used the one-piece die cast buckle latch from the original because the one that comes in the kit is just a bent strip of metal. In conclusion, I'll just say that when I actually do need the band replaced, I&#34;m going to spend the extra few bucks and get a Fitbit original."
1.0,Very pretty but ran small.
1.0,I got this over a month late. It is cheap material. Pretty pattern but bad experience overall.
1.0,Did not pick this one.  I don’t like the S T Ll
1.0,Too small and material extremely thin.
1.0,"there are no sizes listed for this clothing item.  We are not all the same.  I would like to order it, but have no idea what sizes are available."
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture 🤐
1.0,"When I received my package and open it, the jacket look like it had been used, and the plastic that cover the jacket was torn open.  It was a Hot Mess!!! Color do not match what's on the color chart.  I order the white jacket and received it in cream. The white jacket shown in the picture did not match the  jacket I  received in the mail.  If your looking for a white jacket, then this is not the jacket for you. This jacket should be listed as cream not white.  I'm so disappointed!!"
1.0,"True to size, but unflatteringly short. Not at all how it looks on the model. Very disappointed that I paid money for this top."
1.0,Size is extremely small. Returning was unbelievable difficult. Lost my money it went to trash. Will not buy cloths on Amazon.
1.0,They are selling you soap and water in a bottle with a rag and brush. This product does the same thing water and dish soap with a toothbrush does. It will literally give you the same results if not better than the crep protect. Don't believe the hype online as I did.
1.0,These are not nitril glove... they are black vinyl.
1.0,Did not provide enough support or coverage. The cups were almost see through.
1.0,Horrible fit! Way too small
1.0,I loved the look but the fit was way off. Beware.
1.0,Threw the band away after just a week of wear. It started to split right down the middle like two halves were glued together. Very cheap. Would not recommend.
1.0,The dress was entirely too small and difficult to put on The dress is stitched in such a way that I couldn't really tell which was the front and which was the back.I plan to return it for a refund.
1.0,Really bad quality
1.0,I returned this dress immediately. It was not was advertised .<br />I was very disappointed.
1.0,The bling fell of first day and the plastic holder on the inside broke within the first week.  I do not abuse my phone either.
1.0,"Bought this to travel from Anchorage, Alaska to Las Vegas, Nevada round trip. The largest suitcase only made it to Las Vegas dented and broken. Would not recommend."
1.0,I ordered a small and this coat was HUGE & scratchy. There’s no way I could wear it or even try to deal with it. Total flop.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE SOCKS!!  These are a total ripoff. They don't keep your feet any warmer than regular socks and they cost a fortune. Wore them once on a forty degree ABOVE zero day--had cold feet. Returned them immediately for a refund.
1.0,I disliked that the band came apart on one side. Very poor.!!!
1.0,Cut in to you have
1.0,"Cheap fabric, lines with some kind of acetate that doesn’t breath and will surely cook my poor hens slowly. Poorly constructed as well. Total junk. I will spend a little extra and buy local."
1.0,Runs way too small order at least 2 sizes up might want to consider 3 sizes up.
1.0,"While one side of the band went on without any issue, the other side did NOT want to cooperate. When I finally did get it in, one of the 3 little things that help hold the band in place broke off, so now it’s useless. Majorly disappointed."
1.0,I do not like the loose lining inside material. When you take things out it comes with it.
1.0,Terrible! It fell apart in the arms the first time i wore it
1.0,"The material is very soft. Unfortunately, the material is also very easy to tear. I poked a hole in them as I was pulling them up."
1.0,"This garment is basicly useless. The fabric is so thin I could read a regular print book through it in the right lighting and yet so clingy that it gave me flashbacks of past bad relationships. Also, I have a 38c bust, ordered an xl, and she tried to swish my girls into an a. I guess if that's your thing, then this is the romper for you!"
1.0,"Love the look of this, would be great for photos, but not clubbing. Got a lot of compliments but the belt ripped in half after 1 hour of wearing. Not made for ass-shaking."
1.0,Wrist band lasted about one month before the paint started chipping.  It looks so horrible now that I cannot wear it.
1.0,Ordered XL these are so small a child would have trouble fitting into them
1.0,"The size large is about a size 7 junior. Too small, Too thin, and doesn't look anything like the picture..Only nice thing was the color.."
1.0,The battery was dead when it arrived!
1.0,"Wire sunglasses, cheaply made. Strong plastic smell to nose pads."
1.0,The fabric was not what I had imagined and the fit was not correct either - the top did not drape the way I expected - so returned item and did not re-order
1.0,It ran exceptionally small so I will have to return it.  I was very disappointed.
1.0,"F rating on BBB!!! Nice styling but poor quality, and unreachable customer service. I received this watch as a gift approximately 18 months ago. Since then it has received many compliments. However, the wood around the face chipped off about a year ago, and the rest fell off within a month. The $200 watch now looks beat up and cheap. I would love to purchase another Original Grain based on their looks. However, their quality and lack of a repair facility make that an impossibility.  Please save your mo"
1.0,"Super disappointed with these.<br /><br />Judging by the picture and description these should be pretty baggy, soft and comfortable. Instead they're pretty rough, scratchy, and way too small/tight in the legs. Maybe I got too small of a size? I got 34 size and I normally wear 32 so you would think these would be a little on the big size for me.<br /><br />And the legs are shaped kind of weird, almost bow-legged. I'm already a little bow-legged so it looks like I'm extremely bow-legged, and is rather hilarious looking.<br /><br />The shorts in the photo look like completely different shorts than I received.<br /><br />Maybe I need to order a much bigger size? But then I fear the waist may be too loose. I'll update this review if a larger size fits better."
1.0,My kid slipped as soon as he put them on. There is zero traction.
1.0,"I was excited to receive this necklace. However, the moment I first tried it on the clasp broke. Major disappointment!"
1.0,The dangle earrings arrived broken.
1.0,"I usually wear medium of these style. I ordered medium. Tight at the waistline because of the band, but not much compression feeling for the tummy, then kinda loose on the bottom.<br /><br />Fitting can be hit or miss, but definitely don’t like the elastic band."
1.0,Qué pena no poder responder a sus preguntas porque el producto no me llegó y si me retornar el dinero.
1.0,I ordered the 2 x. It wouldn't go over my shoulders.
1.0,"LOLLLL for one, they got the anatomy pair WRONG!!!!!! Bones in wrong places and gave the same foot. I couldn’t help but die laughing. The skulls without the crosses were the best pair and are the only ones worth buying."
1.0,"The end of the band tucks into another part of the band, which is very uncomfortable. To help with comfort, I cut off part of the end of the band. Then, my watch band snagged on some clothes and the watch fell to the floor and cracked. I have owned this watch band for less than 24 hours and it was a big mistake. I am in far worse shape now than I was before. If I repair the watch, it’s $200. I might as well buy a new watch now. And definitely a different watch band!"
1.0,Bought the dress in XL. Top portion looked big enough but could not get the dress up my thighs. Even with zipper all the way down. Cute dress.
1.0,This piece was broken when arrived. Regardless I would have to have the arm the size of Bigfoot for it to fit. I know it's cheap... But still not worth it.
1.0,"I'm only 5,2 tall and still found this pants to be to short . Ankle length :("
1.0,Short were to small.
1.0,Junk ive had dollor store glasses better way overpriced ans so small
1.0,Both pairs broke in exactly the same spot. Came cracked and I didnt notice? Compared to store bought a total knock off and not worth buying again!
1.0,This suit was super cute but didn’t have enough coverage on the underwear. Cute for those that like more cheeky showing.
1.0,broken clasp
1.0,They are not flat contoured on the ends; just a hollow plastic tube with an ope end. Very uncomfortable
1.0,"DO NOT BUY IF YOURE SENSITIVE TO METALS! These were in my nose for two days one night. They are completely corroded, they infected the hell out of my nose. I bought some black rings on here so I figured these would be no different. Wrong! But if you aren’t sensitive to metals I’m sure this product if fine for you. But the glossiness of it does chip off really easily."
1.0,This gave NO coverage. I ordered a medium and was too big so I ordered a small and it didn't cover the most important part of the area! Fabric is very soft and just not much too it.
1.0,I didn't like how far up on the neck it went. Also it was half the size of an item I also got in these size. I would size up two sizes your norm if your interested in this item.
1.0,came stained and (my fault) forgot to return it before the allocated time frame...
1.0,The pants are loose fitting. Its not made fitted like the actual picture. My daughter never wore it because of that. I should have returned it.
1.0,"This skirt was a disappointment in so many ways. The feathers that were attached, the bead that was missing, the sizing that was inaccurate. At this point, I'm very hesitant to order any more clothing from Amazon."
1.0,Definitely not the size on the product. My child won't  be able to wear this for another 2 years. By then she will have had many Christmas'!
1.0,There’s nothing about this I like cheap fabric and poorly put together. Not even the first pocket either
1.0,They were short in the crotch to waist and they were capris and I ordered leggings
1.0,"The black tank fit perfect, the blue and the pink were 2 inches smaller."
1.0,"The printing on these is far too large.  The ""noses"" come down to my chin.  Returned."
1.0,Ugly!!!
1.0,Ordered a 3X it looks like it’s a medium
1.0,Was horrible and very very small
1.0,This product is terrible.  In the middle of the frame the lenses just falls down and out of frame.
1.0,Highly disappointed in the quality of these tights. Tore on first use after a minor fall on a basketball court. Have had others that have endured much more than that. Planned on getting more after testing these first but I highly doubt that I will now.
1.0,It’s not good quality took. A shower and it got dinged real quick had to put it in the garbage
1.0,"Good fit but poor quality. Material wears quickly, created tears in material. These barely lasted one day at the pool."
1.0,Returned due to sizing running small.
1.0,They look good but didn't like how your eyes can be seen
1.0,They were too small and not comfortable.  I was surprised because I really like the other socks I have gotten from this company.
1.0,"I received the watch without one of the pins, which holds the bracelet. I can't wear it because that. It is not good at all"
1.0,This was a huge disappointment! The picture and description of the pendent is beautiful! Then you get the real item after waiting weeks....<br />I will avoid buying from this particular seller in the future.
1.0,Not into it. Kinda big and unshapely
1.0,"These are nothing to boast about and are actually rather impractical/disappointing. The gauges are true to size, but like the other reviewers stated, the plugs are way too short in length and fall out of the ears super easily. Lost one out and about in less than 5 hours of wear without having rubbed my ear or anything warranting it falling out. Also, the pair I thought prettiest came with a noticeably odd indentation/defect in the shape of the flare rendering it unwearable. Not the best photo, but you can see the plug is not completely round. In hindsight, I should have passed on these despite the great price. Not worth paying for plugs that look cheap and just fall out..."
1.0,looks like I have a big foot
1.0,Waste of money. Slide on yoga mat and slip down ankle.
1.0,I bought this shoe for my daughter the first week the red part of the shoe peeling off its no good I am so sorry I bought it I was my money. I will never buy it again.
1.0,It was so cute until it broke after about 10 days
1.0,My daughter did not realize the top two joints were not hollow- making the hands freakishly large and out of proportion for a serious cosplay. They do make a satisfying clicking sound....
1.0,"Very pretty sweater.  The fabric is soft and very stretchy, the seams are not stretchy.  Therefore, the came apart as I was wearing the sweater and going about my day.  Dramatically, like six inch opening on one sleeve and a twelve inch opening on a side seem.  Very disappointing and Anouilh.  Not to mention embarrassing"
1.0,Junky looking
1.0,They are not one size fits all im an XL 5'8 and they are to small also the hem is below my knee great quality material.
1.0,I couldn't get even the first sock on.  Whew!!!!!!  I'll need to return.
1.0,this product does not work
1.0,Fabric is stiff and not comfortable. Way too tight and does not flow
1.0,It was a gift ! Very disappointing at the birthday party ☹️
1.0,"USsed for less a month. it stops moving. replace battery still not working. I think you got what you paid for, but less a month? not worth it."
1.0,"Looks cool, but is cheaply made out of brown plastic, not leather. Also too small for my husband's wrist. Return this product."
1.0,The material exactly resembles white napkins at a restaurant. It’s the same exact fabric. I’m returning
1.0,I only ordered these because it said it would be here before Christmas. Today the 24th I see they will not be here till the 30th now! I would had never ordered them if I had known they would not be here. To say I am unhappy is an  understatement! They are going to be pointless now esp since they are mask for our elves. It pertains to this year so now they will never get used. I will be returning this item. You should not promise something that you can not hold up on.
1.0,"This dress has the tightest , cheapest material!"
1.0,"I bought this outfit for a wedding and am rather disappointed. The shirt fit my 3 month old baby well, but it didn't button up all the way and I had to cut the bottom of the shirt to get him in and out without it being uncomfortable. I'm positive that a larger baby would have a hard time getting in and out of the shirt, and with that being said I'm surprised at how GIGANTIC the pants were. I have a hard time believing that any baby would fit into this outfit well. The bowtie is BLACK, and aside from not matching the navy pants and suspenders isn't even attached to the shirt. It's held on with the cheapest, flimsiest safety pin.<br /><br />I'm not going to have time to find another outfit that will work for the wedding, and as a result I'm going to have to alter every single part of this set. I can't even express how irritated I am to have to change every single part of a brand new outfit just to make it wearable."
1.0,The material was way to thin for me
1.0,stuck with something that doesnt fit me.<br />i should have check but i took it with me on vaca and when i got back it was too late to return
1.0,"The quality of the item is not what I was expecting, too poor quality."
1.0,"Sadly, these just fall off after about 10 minutes of wear. I tried to shrink them, but they stretch back out."
1.0,My husband normally wears a 2XL he purchased this in a 3XL and it barely fit
1.0,Didn't last very long. Screws don't stay in.
1.0,This belt is orange!! Like 70’s leather orange.  Do not get if you are thinking a real leather color!!
1.0,"One earring has the red, yellow, black...the other one only had yellow and black. they don't stay down but get caught up in the hinge, i'm constantly fixing them to stay straight. I do not recommend these earrings."
1.0,Looks like my 2yr old made it!
1.0,I sent it back soon as I opened the package. It was nearly brown. Not as advertised. Do not waste your 40 dollars go to Pandora.
1.0,Product is very poorly made. I purchased two and they both leak very bad.
1.0,poor Quality and not protective
1.0,I bought this for my little girl for her birthday.  It broke as soon as she put it on for the first time.  I sent it back and was refunded so thankful for that.
1.0,They material is cheap and very sheer. The dress was already tearing and unraveling even before being used once. Unfortunately I bought two and both of them the elastic was already unraveling at removal of package! Can not recommend!!
1.0,"These bands are super comfortable, but they are not good quality! The color started wearing off of mine after wearing it just a couple of times. I’m very disappointed."
1.0,while wearing them they leave an imprint of the ring on your finger blueish greenish.
1.0,"very scratchy, not as in photo"
1.0,"The material feels cheap, I am returning"
1.0,These are not polarized. Really disappointed
1.0,"This is for one shirt. These are typically sold in 2 packs and comes in a Whitesville bag. This solo shirt arrived with no tags, no bag and wrapped in blank white tissue. The price they are charging is ridiculous for one shirt, especially after $20 for shipping. It did arrive quickly which was nice."
1.0,The wallet itself seemed to be built pretty well at first aside from not being able to hold money on the inside and me wanting a different color then what I recieved it held about barely 8 cards. Within 3 days the plastic clip to keep it closed broke. If they would make the clip out of metal and maybe charge a few more dollars I think the product would be MUCH better. I loved it while it worked though.
1.0,This hat is too small and it stained my sink???  When I tried to clean it.  Fells like it's made from plastic bottles....GARBAGE
1.0,"These are HEAVY/THICK jeans. Not very comfortable, prefer lightweight."
1.0,Not what I thought it was going to be too thin for me more like summer wear
1.0,"Don't waste your money. Worked sometimes, other times it didn't. Eventually it didn't hold a charge and would not stay connected so it was a. Total waste of money and time. Pavlok, refund my money or send me a new device that isn't defective. Trash.  I should have given that 150 dollars to a homeless person, it would have felt so much better."
1.0,Poor quality material. Was very big on me and could not adjust to my size.
1.0,They were not stretchy enough. They were warm but uncomfortable and restrictive.
1.0,Disappointed. Not made from quality fabric. Don't bother wasting your money!
1.0,"Stretchy and seems comfortable , until you get to work and realize it winds up in forbidden places. Not good..."
1.0,these earrings should not be shown. they were not what I expected. cheap and flimsy. This is the first product that I have purchased that I have been so disappointed. They are so small I don' think I can get them in.
1.0,It works terribly when the day it is supposed to arrive - you get a message saying it isn't coming. That is garbage. Wait for it to arrive and then wait for the refund. Another no interest loan to crooks.
1.0,Bought several shirts from this company and they were ok. This shirt is not cotton but some awful synthetic. It doesn’t breathe and the manufacturing wrinkles don’t come out. A piece of junk
1.0,did not know it was men's sandals.
1.0,The color is faded not what was shown
1.0,The problem with these sandals is the HEEL IS HOLLOW.  They went the WAY OF THE CHINESE CON GAME and molded a hollow heel<br />to save five cents on rubber.  Idiots know full well that a hollow heel will collapse under your weight not to mention they came unglued which<br />is how I learned of the HOLLOW HEEL!  The heel strap is too thin and made of leather so that's going to break too soon.<br />The final problem is the space between the soul and the roof of the toes.  It's a tight fit.  They should have allowed more room for up and down<br />normal movement.
1.0,Highly disappointed.  This  is very small and tight. Didnt even fit  through  my toddler's  head. This more for like  a 6 months old.
1.0,"Bead pattern is not as displayed, hematite is the majority of the beads."
1.0,"Unfortunately, this blouse didn’t even make it past one washing before the seams came completely apart. Very disappointing."
1.0,"too small too tight, feels like little girl size. has absolutely NO room for the butt cheeks. if u have any kind of a butt, this will flatten it. maybe asian girls can fit into this better."
1.0,"They never responded with the return information. And it has to go back to china. Even though this is sold on amazon. Material is really bad, fit is so off and the material is rayon, came wrinkled beyond belief."
1.0,Terrible construction. Seams are uneven and very bunched in places. Also fits a bit small and does not have pockets
1.0,I never saw such terrible quality fitness leggings- the cheapest cotton blend I can remember touching. Possibly the cheapest cotton blend I ever touched. Must return. I’d give zero stars if it was possible.
1.0,Leather is cheap and crooked
1.0,"Did not like it, quality was poor!"
1.0,The idea is great. The latch isnt easy to release though.
1.0,"These shoes are not very comfortable to walk in. I have a narrow size 10 foot. These shoes cut into my ankle, and my feet end up throbbing after walking just a short while. The toe box is even too narrow for my slim narrow foot, and the majority of the pressure from wearing these kills my toes as they slope downward into the shoe from the arch. The quality is okay, and they are very stylish. Overall I would not recommend. I might add that I am 5' 10"" and slim, just for reference."
1.0,"You ever try a shirt on and go why? Why would you do that? This is that shirt. It’s so freaking cute, I was super excited for it, trying it on, no bra needed (yes!) um wait my nipples aren’t pointing out WTH, they have darts that are halfway between your nipple and armpit. Why? Seriously... who thought that double nipples was going to be a good look? Super sad, returned, hoping they redo the pattern in the future because everything was perfect accept the added on nipple affect... which has my hubby laughing hysterically at me."
1.0,The material is nice but it is way too small around the waist. It is not as it looks loose fitting.
1.0,This sizing of this product is not US standards.
1.0,Exactly as pictured. Nice size. Looks a bit cheap. Perfect for teen. Not for grown up that enjoys fashion jewery
1.0,Didn’t like the fit of the pro duct not sewn correctly
1.0,So the top is like to bug and when I tighten the straps then it rides up and I get a Britney Spears look going on. I like the shorts there short enough but long enough to where when u bend over ur still covered. It’s cute. It has a built in bra which is cool but hard to adjust but I’m short so that might effect that. Maybe do measurements on the top just to make sure
1.0,"The outfit looks very cheap and it’s missing the golden bow, returning."
1.0,"DID NOTHING FOR MY LEATHER SOFA,JUST LOOKED OILY!"
1.0,"This bag is not &#34;LARGE&#34;!!! It is TINY. It measures at 8x8, not 15x10 as stated! At $16 this is a total ripoff for a plastic bag."
1.0,Item came broken.
1.0,"Absolutely disappointed, the color rubber off in the first week!"
1.0,"I never ever leave bad reviews but I was highly upset with this purchase. It looked very cute in photos and the reviews were decent so I bought it for my niece for her Birthday. A day before her party it arrived, the stone in the earrings were lopsided, one was missing the backing and some sort of film is over the picture in the necklace center. So now I wasted $16 because there is not enough time to return or get my money back. Don’t waste your time."
1.0,The strap broke within a week!
1.0,Save your money. Waited over a month to receive only to be disappointed. You can’t even see the faces of the characters. The seam goes straight through them.
1.0,"Have bought this brand online before,  came a 4 pack with assorted colors and were stretchy and legs not tight. What was shipped was 2 2-packs of plain black/grey. Not stretchy. Completely different cut and style from what is shown in photo"
1.0,Too big to ever wear. I’ll donate it
1.0,The item description said 100% cotton they had wool and other stuff. Returned them.
1.0,This “dress” fit my 10 year old niece.
1.0,Broke right out of the package.
1.0,"Cheap material the chest side is terrible, and the picture advertised is misleading"
1.0,"This dress took over a month to arrive and is HUGE. I’m terribly disappointed that I waited so long to be completely let down. It’s going to cost more to fit the dress to me, than it actually cost. It’s going in the trash."
1.0,Sry to say but they are fake lol the line in the middle of the due rag is not even on the  velvet part it’s on the inside witch will cause a line to go thru your waves smh was of money
1.0,"These don't form to your feet like Birks do.  They have stayed hard and not broke down at all and I've had them 3 months.  They hurt more than help,  waste of money."
1.0,The earrings are very cheaply made. The metal earring hook wasn’t even connected to the earring (it looks like it’s supposed to be glued together?) therefore I couldn’t even wear them
1.0,Product is very cheaply made.  Material is very thin.  Not warm and cozy as claimed  Cut rather small but still fit.  Wouldn’t buy it again
1.0,I sprayed this on both suede and leather boots/shoes and water still soaked into the material. I sprayed a good amount and let them dry for 24 hours so I would recommend going with Saphir.
1.0,Bought for my son. Broke several times. Finally just threw it away.
1.0,"NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED! Has a pom ball at the top and says &#34;WRX&#34; in the middle of the hat. Does not say Subaru or anything official on the hat. Super disappointing and will never recommend. Not worth my time to return, so now i'm stuck with a hat that says WRX."
1.0,"No pockets as advertised, and very thin fabric.  Very displeased"
1.0,"You do NOT receive what is pictured. The bracelet is very thin and obviously for a female. Very small, fits my 4 year old. The only seller that sells the one that is pictured isn't selling right now!"
1.0,Super thin fabric.  Clingy.
1.0,"Shirts came wrapped up in a tiny ball and they were way too small, size chart must have been for newborns."
1.0,very bad glasses
1.0,Well let's just say it's not what I had expected at all. I have naturally fine curly hair so I am in a need of a satin cap that isnt hard around the edges. This cap is beautiful but it's not as slouchy in the back at all even tho its looks so beautiful as in the picture. The end on the slouch it's pretty tight because of the elastic band. I was very concerned about it being aggressive around my edges smh. It's a bit tight its bareable but maybe a bit much for the baby hairs. I am getting it one stars because my cap fell off through the night as I was sleeping while I was turning over my cap was on the floor and it's too tight around my edges and my edges are already stressed and thinning because of that. I woke up this morning with my edges dry even though I did put oil and hair butter/pomade on my edges to seal the moisture before I went to bed last night. The rest of my hair remain moisturized so not a great experience for me. So I do not recommend for African/fine hair. Smh.
1.0,It has permanent creases from being folded up and stuffed in a tiny package for shipping. Its a very tight fit that does not stretch and the material feels delicate and thin. The thing weighs nothing but there is a huge return shipping fee? It took 3 weeks to arrive. So if you buy it you will lose money if you return it. Buy any other hat from any other seller.
1.0,"This is a great idea, but it has a real achilles heel designed and manufactured right into it. The wiring is very thin and fragile, and where it is connected to the plug from the rechargeable battery, the normal stress of wearing the cap will cause the wires to break off the connector plug posts. I would predict this will happen to virtually every one of these very shortly after being worn a few times. So, you will have a choice of either trying to fix this with a soldering gun (which will only hold as long as the original construction because the fragile wires are the problem) or to simply solder the wires together, which means you will not be able to ever disconnect the battery pack from the lights without cutting the wires so that you can launder the cap, or to give up on the idea of having a lighted cap. I am going to look for a fourth option - some kind of better non-soldered plug assembly that doesn't subject the ends of the wires to twisting and / or bending stress to see if that will return the cap to it's declared value as a washable electrically lighted cap. Unfortunately it is of no use to me tomorrow for this year's Christmas, except as an ordinary warm cap, the likes of which could be had for one fourth or lower than the price this one was."
1.0,Chinese XL is a US size 10 I'm a US 14-16
1.0,"First I wanna say they originally sent me the wrong item. Then I finally get the correct item and it’s one of the cheapest pieces of crap ever!! Literally fell apart taking it out of the package. Thought about gluing it together then got a good look at the material, I’ve gotten better jewelry from a gumball type machine. On top of which, it’s not long enough to be an anklet unless you are a child. Save your money!! At this point I feel they owe me for the inconvenience of dealing with this at all!!"
1.0,No…the soles are so hard.  Sent back immediately.
1.0,"Ordered the red wine and white color. The shirts came in a sealed tight plastic bag, but the red wine color transferred to the white shirt. I sent them back."
1.0,"Dot buy.... it's too little, wrinkly, very cheap looking"
1.0,"thought this was a nice cotton or cotton blend, but in reality it is very cheap and almost a plastic material. Too late to send back but very disappointed."
1.0,Cheaply made... breaks all apart. Dont waste your money.
1.0,"Well pull these out of the box and loved them. Til I put them on and found they were 2 different types of sizes. One for medium calves and the other for larger. Making them,inseparable for me. Also the bigger boot had a dried adhesive that won't wash off. This sucks, now I have to return them...and I had bought them for a specific event...."
1.0,It got many pills in it and I hand washed it
1.0,"dark and blurry, can't see clearly out of them, the material is very fragile, don't recommend them. Spend a few more dollars and get a better brand"
1.0,"This tutu was such a disappointment, I agree with another reviewer who said it seemed like it was made from scraps. It was also only two layers of tulle, totally see through, and way too awkwardly long. Returned."
1.0,"I ordered three of them, but one did not work.. While trying to set the time on it, the minute hand caught onto the hour hand and both were stuck together and the second hand never worked. However, the other two  are working fine."
1.0,I'm not even that tall.
1.0,"Didn’t like the color of the purse, had weird spots in it, not natural like, also the pockets are all ripping out after having it a month."
1.0,I ordered a medium and received a XXL the package says M but the actual dress is a XXL. It's huge. I ordered another size medium hoping to get it for the wedding I'm going to and received another XXL... they will be going back.  The material is heavy and there is a weird smell on the fabric.
1.0,All my charms fell off in the first day. Very disappointed.
1.0,the stain rinsed off with water!!! i thought i was bleeding for a moment. POS

1.0,ripped off
1.0,Left shoe came with brown stain on top
1.0,"I disliked that this product did not meet the expectations of the picture. They didn’t have any pockets and I ordered a larger size, but it didn’t fit as expected either."
1.0,Color wayyyyyy off and dress really cheap material for price
1.0,"Very thin shiny, weird material that it does not look to be made out of in the pictures. The neckline is very high & my daughter said it felt like it was choking her. Plus it's cropped pretty high so you'd have to watch out when raising your arms and she's very petite, only 5'3&#34; & 105lbs. Cheaply made too."
1.0,"My prescription eyeglasses are small, but these sunglasses do not fit over them."
1.0,The overlay made the lower part of the dress restrictive. Additionally the quality was not great as the material that made the design was falling off.
1.0,Very thin and def not OVERSIZED!  The K and E are half printed on the inside of the neck of the shirt. You can see it from the back but not the front. Looks cheap.
1.0,"They came at 29&#34; inseam, not 30&#34;. I wore them anyway with flats. Washed them once in cold water, tumble dried them on low delicate. They are now 27&#34; long.  I'm returning them."
1.0,Clearly states “3 pack”. Pictures indicates 3 tanks. Only received 1 blue and 1 red.
1.0,It broke within the first five minutes. The cartilage clutch is really tight on my ear. Definantly not worth it.
1.0,I like the shirts. They are quality and great for the gym but when I tried to order more I ordered an XL but they send XXL. I return the XXL with a specific note that the item is the wrong size and I would like them to ship me a size XL in exchange.... Well guess what... They sent me another XXL and this happened 4 different times. I really wanted the shirts is why I went through all of this but even after attempting this a 4th time the still sent XXL.<br /><br />Very disappointing and very poor customer service.
1.0,"It’s beautiful, it was a small not a xl"
1.0,They look like they're made from garbage bags. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Out of the box one of the arms was broken I couldn't even try them on I'm just returning them very bad quality product also they are currently not available I guess The seller also figured out and took the product off
1.0,What can a human do with this?!? This is jewelry for a doll or something
1.0,"They were way too small, see through. They looked child sized. I'm a small and I couldn't even get them all the way on. S/M is not for people who actually wear these sizes."
1.0,Bad quality is not an exact description this is worse than dollar store quality
1.0,It had a hole in it when I received item
1.0,put them back together rather than return.
1.0,I hated how it only have me two of the same chain. Very disappointed!
1.0,Never got it ordered two of them
1.0,"So there was a visible, sideways rip on the back of this that is not part of the normal cut up the back. We were planning to cover the back with a hoodie anyway but its a big issue to arrive damaged. On top of that the movable jaw didnt work very well for my husband. Not impressed at all with this."
1.0,The jewerly turned copper and infected my piercing don't buy!!
1.0,Cheap. Started to rip on the second wear.
1.0,"Bout the size 5-6. It could fit a very small 9 month old at best. It’s too bad because these are cute, and soft but tiny. The tag says 80. I’m guessing it’s the size."
1.0,fit perfectly.  side seem unraveled after one use.
1.0,"Belt buckle broke after only a few weeks of light use. Cheaply made, don’t buy this belt."
1.0,Cute outfit but it was too big.
1.0,"How was a crop top sent, when it was supposed to be a regular shirt!  The shirt is filthy and has what appears to be a blood stain on it!  I didn’t pay over $26 for nastiness!  Disgusting 🤮"
1.0,"I was super excited to get this dress and wear it. However, the very first day I wore it, it literally tore right down the back seam showing my bum cracker. This happened all while I sat down in my chair. Yes the dress fit! It's not a tight fitting dress it's flowy and loose. Bad day for me because I work at a school with Teenagers all day. Thank Gawd I had a light sweater to wrap around my waist that day.  The material is super light and somewhat silky but made out of poor quality material. I should have known since I ""thought"" I was getting a good deal.  My suggestion is save your money and purchase better quality.."
1.0,These shirts are terrible quality I cannot unbutton the crotch snaps because I fabric is going to rip.
1.0,This is not Sterling Silver! Within a week the the silver rubbed off revealing copper underneath.
1.0,Awkward fitting uncomfortable fabric
1.0,"As far as wooden plugs go, they're great. But why are they being advertised as 35mm when they are not? My ears are 35mm, and after wearing these plugs for a few days my ears shrunk up enough to wear I can't get the rest of my 35mm plugs back in. This SUCKS. Make sure your products are the actual size you're advertising."
1.0,This shirt only came in medium that’s a shame because the medium is  Really a small would be wonderful if it came in more sizes  I got the light blue one I was going to order the light pink one but was no longer available why ??
1.0,"Although they are very cool looking, the quality is very poor.  Within one week, one of the blue lace straps broke. Within three weeks, two more blue lace straps are barely hanging on.  This week, one of the Velcro straps separated.  I am just outside the return window, unfortunately. Such a disappointment."
1.0,"It was a waste of money, its totally different as described!"
1.0,"Too small, not happy with it."
1.0,"These are not a bracelet, an anklet or a necklace, very odd size not useful at all"
1.0,Returned. Not what I thought it was. My fault
1.0,First of all the fabric is cheap the sewing is horrible and it doesn’t look at all like what they’re selling!
1.0,Broke first time I tried to wear it.
1.0,"I bought these in a large based on the sizing chart and the reviews saying they were true to size, but upon trying the leggings on I could hardly pull them past my calf muscles. I weigh 195 pounds and I do have wide hips and a butt. I can’t even get these past the lower part of my thighs."
1.0,"Too long, too wide."
1.0,No recibí este articulo
1.0,Had to return the sweater - as soon as I opened it the whole entire right sleeve thread came undone and unraveled all the way up the arm. Poor quality.
1.0,It broke today..so sad
1.0,I ordered this scarf back I. August 2011 and just got it in January 2022 after the order was canceled twice. Very nice for the price.
1.0,This was horrible received it broken thrown in garbage it’s not worth it
1.0,"Did not like the feel on the inside.  Too much foam, no support ! Might be good for a slipper but not wearing out doors.  I would not buy again.  I sent the product back."
1.0,"I was wrong, they are not  solid gold, very upset."
1.0,These socks last 4 months
1.0,i am not fat. I am average size with nice hips (hourglass shape) this could have fit a triple 0...but not a woman with nice hips -.- so disappointing.
1.0,sizes is smaller than they say. order up a size or two
1.0,It was wrinkle.
1.0,"These glasses look beautiful in pictures, however, I was extremely disappointed with the quality and the presentation upon arrival. There was no protection offered for the eyeglass lenses beyond the small cardboard box, nor did it come with any kind of cloth to clean them.  The glasses themselves felt very cheap and had a plastic feeling to them akin to a pair of glasses you'd pay $10 dollars for. Thankfully a full refund was made."
1.0,I washed this dress before wearing it and the fabric became so thin and discoulored in some places.  I’ll probably just use it as a beach coverup now.
1.0,Dress is too big.
1.0,"Returning it, very heavy and the prism have strange artifacts in them.<br />I went with the one sold by Dynamic-living and I'm much happier now."
1.0,"Shirt is completely see through and is more around the size of a small/medium.  I have a bigger chest so purchased the biggest size, but even my sister-in-law couldn't wear this shirt comfortably and she's a medium/large"
1.0,Horrible cheap and cheap fabric..made in china👎
1.0,"The sheerness is very noticeable. It does not pass the squat test. If you want to wear it, you would have to wear nude underwear."
1.0,"Very Odd fit, would not recommend to others.  The print goes into the arm pits and looks very awkward.  Also runs a bit small and shorter than expected."
1.0,Discovered dried blood on these shorts when I opened the package. Buyer beware.
1.0,Turned green three days of wearing it
1.0,"Not what was advertised. Very small, no stretch, waste is not high.  Thank you Amazon for returning this for me"
1.0,Was too small to get on
1.0,Received the top today and it looks NOTHING like the picture!! Poor quality and the color is off.
1.0,this watch was listed at $8.99 last year lol
1.0,"It’s a cute sports bra , bought a medium thinking it would fit small but it fit big instead . I’m like barely a c cup / 5’2 146 lbs. and my boobs are like popping out of this . No support"
1.0,Did not fit my big booty I'm a size ten ... With a wais of 24 inches .. Really cheap looking too .. The color looked like I bought it from the beauty supply
1.0,"So, this was a pain in the butt to get in. They are super cute once they are in. I also had the worst time trying to get it out of my ear because, it got struck! I’m guessing from turning in my sleep it got twisted in my ear and I basically had to rip it out. It has caused me to completely take out my piercing from being extremely sore. I've only had it for oh, 15 years too. I would not recommend this product, especially if you toss in your sleep."
1.0,Wayy too lose. I even got a small just to have a tighter fit.
1.0,This watch looks really nice. I used it for a few weeks until it broke. The windup knob broke off during normal use. I don't suggest buying this watch.
1.0,"Cheap looking and the wire is turning brown looking, not what I expected."
1.0,"I've been buying these for my daughter for a couple years now, not for water use but just as a general minimalist shoe. Just got a new pair, and unfortunately they've made a couple design 'enhancements':<br /><br />1) There's now arch support in the sole<br />2) The heel is a bit elevated<br /><br />Both of these things are bad for the feet, particularly those of young children. Time to find a different brand."
1.0,Color was not the way it looks. Much prettier online than in person
1.0,"I bought this bracelet and loved it. For two days, when it fell apart. I do love the idea of interchangeable zodiac signs."
1.0,Patch is iron on. Picture is deceiving
1.0,"Not adjustable, too big for my septum.  Have no idea what to do with all of them now."
1.0,Love this bracelet and only wear for special occasions. The second time I wore it a stone fell out. Unfortunately I cannot find it… so I guess it’s not made as nicely as it appeared to be. An even exchange would be wonderful… we will see as I have not asked for it yet… fingers crossed…
1.0,"Case is made cheap, doesn't close tight or evenly, who ever is writing these reviews is NOT BE TRUTHFUL!"
1.0,They broke two days after getting them
1.0,"I am a size M and ordered a M and this was way too small. Like legit an extra small, it barely covered my boobs & it’s not like those are big.<br /><br />I returned the item and got my refund."
1.0,runs small. rubber in waist band makes uncomfortable to the skin
1.0,It dint work for me
1.0,Make sure you get a smaller size it runs small!!! Disappointed no time to return it.
1.0,Cheaply made... it looks like something you would buy at a low end swapmeet. The band attachment is so poorly designed ... NOT at all like the picture - seriously save your money... the only part that was great was the easy fit of the plain versa into the watch face portion of the band... BUT when I went to actually put the watch on it was so strange and seemed like they had made the band / size adjustment pin backwards  and the holes were so wide it was either too tight or so loose that it would not make good contact for heart rate monitoring.
1.0,Bought it for my nephew and it ripped when he was trying it on.
1.0,Sharp and not comfortable
1.0,The small was way to big
1.0,Cheaply made product. Fabric does not hang like the pics. Extremely unflattering and creates Cameltoe.
1.0,I received these on March 17th and I just notice that the side glass is gone. I dont know when it fell out but I just notice it missing.
1.0,This product came to me already worn with stains and a rip in the butt.
1.0,This shirt looks super cute in the pictures... but its move of a pregnancy shirt!!!! small on top and huge on the bottom. I ordered a medium and it fits more like an XL it was huge!
1.0,"The fabric reminded me of a parachute. My daughter said it sounded like one, too. Returned."
1.0,They don’t have much ink to them & since the clear plastic lids on all of them were cracked they really didn’t work great from the get. I planned on using for a kids craft but they are garbage
1.0,"Product was returned right away! Does not reflect its description and it’s size is bigger than described and I purchased an xs. Purchased the grey and was so happy and fit perfectly, but not this time around"
1.0,These are so cheaply made... Don't waste your money. I ordered few different ones and threw them in the garbage because half of them were either already broken or simply too cheap looking.
1.0,Too small and made with cheap material if you want your earrings to last Do not buy these earrings
1.0,"Only 3 of the shirts are the moisture-wicking material. One of the shirts is just a regular cotton t-shirt. My son will not wear these, so this is a waste of my money. Also, since that shirt can be bough much cheaper, you aren’t getting the price per shirt on the other 3 that you think you are. The fact that this company actively worked to deceive customers is inexcusable."
1.0,shirt i received is NOTHING like shown. This material is really strange and it feels like a really thick Childs bathing suit. It is really wide and really short like you should be 3 feet tall. Horrible purchase
1.0,"I loved it, but the second time I use it the chain changes color."
1.0,Not tight ar all!! I ordered small !
1.0,Cheap material and irregular fit. Definitely size up at least one or two sizes. I returned mine immediately
1.0,No cashmere or wool in product shipped. Returned
1.0,Cheap.<br />Thin.<br />Snagging material.<br />Looks like a kids size apron.<br />Will be returning.
1.0,This product is low quality. It is very see through and the cut is just weird. Would not recommend.
1.0,I wore the chain for only one week and it is already broken and is in the jewelry shop for repair.  Bad stuff.
1.0,"Wanted to wear them , but today as I put them on the clip was broken..Why is merchandise not checked before it is sent out ..A total waste of money..I was disappointed an will make sure I will nener order anything from them again.."
1.0,I have purchased two pairs of these glasses. The first one's frame broke and now the frame of the second one has snapped as well.  Glue does not fix these breaks.  I do not recommend them no matter how good they look.
1.0,"this was great, and arrived really fast, but broke after a couple of weeks :("
1.0,I should have read size better I thought it would much bigger.  Very disappointed about the size of a quarter
1.0,Very cheap product. I would not buy again. It’s going in the yard sale.
1.0,This band fits the moto 360 2nd gen. The band pins brakes in a day of wearing. I will not buy this product again. Look at different brands. Also even though it said it's stainless the clip of the band had a rust spot on it.
1.0,Ordered them last year. I still haven’t received anything. I knew it would take a while but it’s been a good 5 months.
1.0,"It just didn't  feel right, I just liked the  way it look at the time"
1.0,Cheap looks like made in china
1.0,Bodice and skirt are two different shades of blue. Too small. Fabric is rough. Save your money.
1.0,I've had two pairs of these glasses from the same company and each have broken within 3 weeks of use. No wonder they were so cheap....
1.0,Not even close to what I thought I was buying.
1.0,Fits way to small
1.0,Terribly quality. I just tossed it as I couldn't use it as a gift and it wasn't worth the return fees.
1.0,I did not like these at all
1.0,Way to long of a band. Sending it back.
1.0,I ordered a 36E and It didnt even strap in the back or even have any coverage at all!<br /><br />The size that is supposedly the cup size “E” is definitely fitting like a “B”.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn’t waste your time or money.<br />(the little money this so called “bra” is)
1.0,It said in the discription that it was sterling silver and a real tourquose stone ....well the stone was plastic and it turned green the very first day
1.0,Not what I expected at all. Very disappointed. And it didn't even fit
1.0,When I received the order it was ripped and the material came off the band
1.0,Received wrong item and it's in cursive instead of print like described. Very disappointed as this was suppose to be for Christmas
1.0,Turns your skin green & the color turns from silver to a rusted color in just a couple of days. Not worth it at all.
1.0,To small. Can't return. Waste of money.
1.0,Es muy incomodo
1.0,Shrank after first wash to a point where it is unwearable.
1.0,"The chemical smell on these was strong when they arrived but I figured if I washed them a few (or many more) times they might be fine. I have a lot of allergies and chemical sensitivities so it’s pretty typical for me to do some work before I can wear something new. These have gone through multiple soaks and washes in multiple products to try to remove the smell and they’re still horrible. This is not the normal “amazon fragrance” that is on many of my packages/items ordered. I wish I’d just returned them but I’ve never had something be so impossible to remove the chemical smell from. I might leave them in the sun for a month and then give up. I don’t know what’s on these but it’s very strong and very hard to get rid of, and I’m usually good at this. Ignoring all that, they seem like they might have been nice? They’re thin which is what I wanted. I question what the materials are though, they almost feel like acrylic or something (although I’ve avoided touching much due to the smell). I hope for the sake of others maybe something just spilled on them in the amazon warehouse and this is not what they all smell like. Maybe I received the wrong product."
1.0,These cheap items came in a small ziplock bag and had holes in the gloves.
1.0,This product is so small.  Not like shown or advertised.<br /><br />Had to return.
1.0,Most of the earrings were damaged. I couldn’t even get them to bend to go into my ear. Worst product ever - buyers beware!
1.0,Tried for 2 weeks.  Not at all warming. On final day one element heated up and was burning my foot.
1.0,Plastic filtering tabs keep falling off thus face mask making it useless.
1.0,The item was horrible the fitting was too small and it doesn’t look like anything in the picture is the worst thing ever that I bought and it doesn’t fit. I haven’t to tossed in the trash because the seller hasn’t contacted me to return it I have no choice but to put one star because I couldn’t put zero.It’s a waste of money
1.0,I ordered these specifically for compression and they are not compression garmets.  Plus the length on them is way too short.
1.0,"I purchased this item back in October 2017 because I love the color purple and the design of the necklace. I finally decided to wear it for the first time this past Sunday to compliment a purple outfit. Unfortunately, the necklace broke as I was attempting to close the snap.  I love the necklace but I am disappointed I did not get to wear it because its broken. Unfortunately, the return window has passed. Therefore, I am stuck with an item that serves no purpose whatsoever."
1.0,"These are NOT headbands. They are round ponytail holders. NOT as described. And when you try to return them, they want you to pay restocking for their mistake"
1.0,Did not work for me<br /> I am red-green impaired<br />Did color blind tests . The glasses did not help. In one test I was slightly worse with the glasses.<br />They deserve NO stars. Was unable to post unless I gave it one.
1.0,I never had flip flops this tight on my feet and after walking a bit took them off and put them were they belong in the trash
1.0,"Beautiful earrings,  but clasp doesn't work on one of the earrings! That's why I sent the first pair back."
1.0,So disappointed.  I ordered 2XL and I couldn't even get it over my head
1.0,I didn't get the right necklace and it was missing the bracelet.
1.0,"This dress was very, very cheap looking.  We sent it back without even taking it out of the plastic."
1.0,Large clunky and cheap looking
1.0,Very poor quality & print does not look like picture
1.0,Not good. Not on time and packing damaged
1.0,"It was huge. The middle, which is supposed to be kind of ribbed, is only extra fabric that looks bunchy. It's horrible. I laughed for hours after I opened it. I donated it. Maybe someone else will like it."
1.0,Extremely poor fit  The elastic is a poor choice for this material.  A waste of money because I can not wear them at.
1.0,Tarnished immediately
1.0,Crap not even close to the picture
1.0,Not a plus size. Says 4x but my friend who is a size 8 couldn't fit in it.
1.0,Terrible fabric. Looks like it was sewn by my 4 year old. Super disappointed.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:3592c372ed1aebfde036f8c2cb93d8d4]] I cannot speak to the size or shape of the jacket as the second I removed it from it’s blue fabric bag (nice), I smelled the mold and saw it growing in blue-grey all around the seams and under folds. I was scared of touching it any more than necessary and was keen to seal it back into it’s pouch.<br /><br />I hoped it was a fluke and requested a replacement instead of a refund, and the second jacket arrived with ‘slightly less’ mold.<br /><br />The price had been reduced significantly before I ordered, which makes me think the vendor knew there was something off."
1.0,El producto lo envié y solicité reembolso el 16 de noviembre y aún no recibo el reembolso.
1.0,Quality bad can’t wear
1.0,Loves the material and look. It was just made for a xL not a small.
1.0,"Normally I’m XL, ordered XXL so it would be loose, fits like it’s a large, WAY TO SMALL"
1.0,Top part is see through and so unbelievably thin! The tulle part in the skirt is flat and does not look like the picture no matter what you do! It’s also bigger than usual. Not worth it for that price
1.0,Read the reviews that said these were toddler size. They came and are adult size.
1.0,"No where in the description does it mention that this is toddler girls size 5. I thought it was girls size 5 as in juniors. Additionally, the packaging was horrible and crumbled up in a small envelope and it was dirty. It was dirty on both the front and the back of the pants in several places so I can't even give it to anyone even if I wanted to.See pics."
1.0,"This arrive and was in good condition, then i washed it INSIDE of a MESH BAG, with my washer set to the sensitive and dry cleaning setting. Within MINUTES the lace came undone on the end of the sleeves and before i could stop the wash, it was to late. My WIFE's new CHRISTMAS gift was destroyed, never to be fixed. I am VERY unhappy with this product. I think it is a FAKE, because if it were not i do not think it would have shredded so easily. I WILL be attempting a return of this product."
1.0,Magnets broke in a couple days. The small magnet did not stay where it was supposed to
1.0,It is basic
1.0,Its a stretchy material - Not good for a formal event.
1.0,Green didn't show shoulders. Pink was tiny and. Cheap. Looks like they didn't finish it or got a cheaper brand.  Terrible
1.0,Very cheap feel to this jacket. Very cheap. Not impressed.
1.0,Large is like a small C
1.0,This is very cheap material. Had for one day and already peeling off. The flower patters is peeling off
1.0,Got XL they fit extremely comfortably around the waist but they fit saggy and loose around my legs and groing. I have very large tight and underware has no elasticity.
1.0,"Wasn’t expecting much just needed them to match other bridesmaids. Very very uncomfortable, no support whatsoever but cute just won’t ever wear again lol"
1.0,"Got these for my hubby. These fit true to size. But they’re extremely uncomfortable, he could feel the ball shape when walking. He only had them on for a couple minutes and his feet hurt the rest of the day. Might be better if the footbed was lined, so it would feel more even when you walk."
1.0,"Tela incómoda, mala calidad"
1.0,Awful sunglasses.  Broke on my face the second day I wore them.
1.0,I had to return this item because one arm seam was not properly sealed and there was a 2inch opening. Poor quality even without the damage.
1.0,"This heart looks nothing like the picture on Amazon!,"
1.0,Item fell apart bow came off i tried another one the second one also fell off not happy with item
1.0,This is not good quality... you get what you pay for I guess !
1.0,Sizing is a joke.  Arm hiles for toddlers
1.0,Item came missing pieces. I'm very disappointed as I ordered it for a birthday gift for sisters. Please double check items before mailing them to make sure they are complete as advertised.
1.0,Nice socks but they were described as navy but they are actually royal blue.
1.0,The product did not work properly.  I followed instructions and sent it to be repaired and I was told it could not be repaired.  It could not be returned.  It was worthless and I was cheated out of my money.
1.0,The chain is too short to double up and too awkwardly long to wear as normal. And I don't have a large neck either lol. You get what ya pay for sometimes 🤷‍♀️
1.0,The color is not even close to light blue! It's literally dark grey.
1.0,Such a bad quality. I am returning it.
1.0,Doesn't stay on at all- it was gone within the first hour.
1.0,"These pants suck beyond description. Pockets don't fall in the right place, cargo pockets belong on the side, not the front. These pants are heavy and hot, maybe would be ok in very cold climate. They don't fit around the waist, even though they are right size, they keep falling down. The legs are way too long, will need hemmed to be of any use. I wore these once and said never again. I really miss the days when clothes were made in USA. Save your money and loo kat something else."
1.0,I wanted to like these.. they shipped bent which I was able to bend back into place but after wearing them for maybe a month the plastic bottom broke off of the right side.
1.0,Already ripping
1.0,All the “rhinestones” fell off after about 2 weeks. Now there is no bling.
1.0,Was broken upon arrival I had to return it
1.0,These are really pretty but mine was delivered with one of the stones out! Unfortunately these were given as a gift so I am unable to return them. I wish I could get a replacement pair.
1.0,"I use my shoes every day. After a month or so, they started to break. I expected it to last longer."
1.0,Poorly made and far too large. It arrived with stains and seams falling apart like someone had already worn it.
1.0,"The quick release simply slides within the band vs. spring action, causing the band (and my watch) to fall off my wrist over time. It was fortunate I didn't lose my watch or have it land on concrete and crack."
1.0,The product was great the first week. Then it stop keeping correct time. Waisted 10 bucks. Seems more of a hasle to just return it.
1.0,"This dress is cut so that the waist line falls far above the waist and instead hits the chest area, resulting in an uncomfortable fit.  You can pull the dress down so that the waist line falls at the waist, but then as soon as you move, the waist rides back up the the chest/ribcage area. The dress needs to be redesigned so that it is cut to fit at the waist. Because of the cut, the belt is essentially useless. The star pattern is pretty, but the material is hot and uncomfortable. I really wanted to like this dress."
1.0,"This did not come with the doll,super disappointed..."
1.0,The seal collar at the bottom of the blender is not a good fit. As you screw on the glass cylinder body the seal gets out of alignment and will leak when blending. One has to manually align it so forms a leak-proof seal. This both time consuming and an example of poor engineering.  Recommend this I DO NOT!
1.0,"Do not buy this dress. After only five washings on gentle cycle, in a garment bag, and air drying, the seams split in two places. Very disappointed because I had loved this dress."
1.0,"The white dress was too big, but the sleeves were tight.  The over apron was supposed to be a large, but it was extra small.  I couldn't wear it and was out of town so I couldn't return it.  Totally waste of money."
1.0,"Product feels kind of cheap, plus it’s too small for my chest."
1.0,"I expected larger I guess. They were a gift, but she likes larger earrings. She gifted them elsewhere."
1.0,Lucen bien en foto pero en realidad son dos pedasos de caucho.
1.0,These earrings were very cheaply made. The metal had jagged edges. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"I loved this little ring at first, then after a little while the silver coating began to melt away and the ring became rough on the inside and turned my finger green with wear. Didn't expect much but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised as sometimes happens with Amazon products. I honestly wouldn't buy this again or recommend to anyone. I would suggest buying one from Etsy or something that clearly states that its fully silver or whatever material you want."
1.0,"Today is the second time to use it after I bought it. After charging, it started blending for two seconds and made a super loud noise. Then it stops working.  It broke down so quickly.<br />I promised myself, in the future when I order stuff online, I will open the box right away and try to test it more before the return window closes.<br /><br />It's very cute looking and easy to clean. For one time use"
1.0,"It is cheap and poorly made with holes in both sleeves. The tassels are not as pictured in ad .The fabric is poor quality. There are loose threads all over the sweater , it smells of chemicals and sheds terribly. The fabric around the shoulders is stretched thin..... not sure where this was made or who markets this item but there is no tag anywhere in the sweater and when I click on the link to ""Mintsnow"" it says that it doesn't exist. Be very careful . I will only order name brands I know from now on. I only give this 1 star because I have to in order to leave a review."
1.0,"Super cute shoes that appear to be of good quality runs small. My daughter just grew out of size three, and can’t fit these size 4s. The heel of her foot was hanging off the back. I wish they came in a 5, I would have ordered them. Other than the fit, I really liked the sandal."
1.0,Stitching started to come apart after first wash.
1.0,"Don’t be fooled by this photo these are not long pants. They’re made for someone no taller than 5’. Horrible, had to return. The quality is awful. Don’t bother,"
1.0,Lenses were loose
1.0,The dress is made out of tent material. There is no way I would ever wear it.
1.0,The item I got looked absolutely nothing like the item in the picture. Colors not even close and material was some weird felt like material?? Returning.
1.0,"Missed the (tight) return date, so I'm stuck with this. Fit fine, but I thought the print was really unattractive in person—kind of ugly, actually, though it looked fun in the picture. Oh, well."
1.0,"Poor quality., Nose bridge off center, non-photo-chromic."
1.0,"I bought this to give as a Christmas gift and I am so glad I opened it and check it! There are eggs of some sort all over it ! This is unnecessary, unacceptable! Do not buy! I am so disappointed and disgusted!!!"
1.0,"I was looking for the same mostly cotton socks I have used before.  The description said cotton and cushion.  The socks I received are 100% polyester and thin.  In addition, it is difficult to return them because I do not have a printer to print the label."
1.0,The pockets hang down to my knees!!!<br />I purchased this one because my first one fit very nicely. I’m 5’7” but I have to keep one of my hands in the pocket to prevent tripping over the hem.
1.0,Runs extremely small!!! The fit is strange. Too tight in the chest and arms. I will be sending back.
1.0,"terrible.. they were plastic, not even metal."
1.0,Not what I Expect it
1.0,"Cheap material, cheaply made, top is stiff as a board and fits like a clothes hanger. Uneven material for the cover up"
1.0,I was un able to get them on myself
1.0,"This watch does look nice, but in reality is nothing but garbage. The band links are not solid and featherweight. But most notably the watch does not appear to be 316L. Within 30 minutes of putting the watch on, my wrist broke into a rash. The price would lead you to believe it is made of some quality, it is not. There are Stuhrlings, Bulovas, and Swiss Legends in this price range, I would go in that direction."
1.0,First put them on and they were way to big. Very cheap quality and honestly i believe there only worth $10
1.0,I ordered a 3x to make sure it would fit. I am 1x or 2x. It did not fit. I gave it to my mother who wears a medium. It fit her perfectly! No excuse for that much variation in size!
1.0,"This is the perfect example of cat fishing the shoes look so cute in these pics but they’re hideous and cheap looking in person, also I ordered an 8 and it was like I ordered a 10 or 11 they run huge! Please don’t waste your money on these hideous shoes."
1.0,"Watch does not run. Garbage watch, returning for refund.<br /><br />I have other &#34;cheap&#34; skeleton watches that are still working after 7 years of use that cost half what this one cost and this one lasted less than 30 seconds.<br /><br />Amazon needs to weed out these sellers of junk merchandise."
1.0,"The main issue is the fact it clearly states there is a M shaped nose piece.  There is not.  The mask is big and without being able to adjust around the nose, it is useless."
1.0,Earrings are HUGE!
1.0,Completely different color. - not as pictured !! It is sooo bland !!
1.0,"It's not soft it all, you can feel the cheap material also are dark spots in to the fabric. It feels just like a painting tarp if you have use one."
1.0,"I wear these all the time, this one, way way too small and the fabric is different.  If you have owned this before, beware, this is Not like the ones I buy elsewhere with same brand name.<br />Disappointed"
1.0,I bought these less than 6 months ago and have used them twice and the zippers have already gotten stuck and pulled apart. Completely disappointing.
1.0,"I ordered this top to use it as part of my Snow White Costume for Halloween. Thank goodness I had a backup costume.<br />This top is garbage. One wash and it started shedding and once I took it out of the mesh bag, all these black shreds and blue sequins spread everywhere. The more I tried shaking it, the more black stuff came out (See Picture). What a waste of money. I'm too embarrased to even donate it to Goodwill. It went straight in the trash. Ruined my whole costume idea. I suppose you get what you pay for. Would give it 0 stars if I could."
1.0,THE HAT FITS HORRIBLE. THE TOP IS FLAT NOT FULL LIKE THE SALES PICTURE SHOWS.ITFEELS REALLY CHEAP WITH THE GATHERED ELASTIC EDGE IN THE REAR OFTHE  CAP.
1.0,The emblem came off very shortly after my husband starting using it. Now it's just a silver clip I paid too much for.
1.0,Been through 2 pairs in 2 weeks poorly made. They look great but terribly made disappointed I am wish they were a little better
1.0,"The images for this product show that each link is replaceable. As you can see, each one has a pin slot. That is NOT how the product comes. There are only 4 links on each side that you can remove. The rest DO NOT have the pin slots like it is shown in the images. If you were looking to remove each link, don't purchase this because you won't be able to. The only reason I am keeping this is because I do not have another band to use with my watch at the moment. I was mislead, hopefully you aren't either!"
1.0,Very thin. Crap material.
1.0,"It started falling apart, luckily the ceremony was over."
1.0,In the picture it fits proportionately. I used the size chart. But its too big and sloppy. Plus the fabric is a weird feeling.
1.0,"These socks are listed as X-Lrg . The foot part corresponds to about a size 6 men's shoe .  X-Lrg , you've got to be joking ."
1.0,"Soooo, I bought these bag a while a go and used the big one as my everyday purse. There was a smell initially that was bothering me and would NOT go away. The smell even migrated to everything IN the purse; a book, wallet, EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! So I had a few friends smell my book to see what they thought it smelt like and they are right. EVERYTHING SMELLS LIKE MARIJUANA AND IT KEEPS GETTING STRONGER!!!"
1.0,"Received this SOl mini in late October or worked well for about a month, then slowly began to dim.. stopped working all together after about 30 days, replaced batteries and it will not lite again...  After battery replacement, it works without the top on, but fully put together and installed... No lights...  Throwing it away.. I expected more than 30 days... Don't waste your money!"
1.0,"The material was thick, rough, and itchy. It didn’t hug the body whatsoever and even the color wasn’t quite navy blue. Very disappointed."
1.0,Just not a flattering fit for me. Bust area very narrow and tight.. I have an athletic build and just not good for me.
1.0,Way to small to fit a man's head.  Also too expensive to ship back.
1.0,If I would of known these were made in China I would of never purchased.
1.0,Hate it
1.0,While it looks great the fact that the end screws on quickly becomes a problem. Within three uses the screw end was stripped and no longer attaches.<br /><br />Don’t buy it.  Not worth it.
1.0,I was only wore it for about a day before it broke :(
1.0,this product runs very small! i suggest sizing up one to two sizes!
1.0,"These pins were advertised as Disney Trading Pins, big lie... These pins are knock offs, which there for means you can not trade them... they are very thin, very small, there are chips in the paint, wrinkles in the paint and the princesses faces are all deformed... I was very upset but I guess you get what you pay for :("
1.0,"I bought this twice. I bought it my size first which is medium, which top fitted like it was XS and bottom pants fitted too baggy like a L, so I bought it the second time as a XL and even then the top fit like it was still small but longer in length. Literally pissed me off and I threw it away. Not even worth wasting my time returning this junk. 0/10 would not recommend. If I could give this 0 stars I would, this doesnt even deserve 1 star. WASTE OF MONEY!"
1.0,"Prior to ordering, this item was listed as red licorice ropes. Upon placing the order, the item description was changed to reflect 'sour strawberry laces' which are in no way licorice. Item is also non-returnable."
1.0,I am a 2x in US sizes. I ordered a 6X. (3xl conversion is what it said) NOPE! This is made for a small Asian boy me thinks!<br />The arm holes are for a fetus.<br />And the whole thing smells like gasoline! Literally like fuel was spilled on it!
1.0,"The material its made of is very stretchy t-shirt like and very, very poor quality.<br />the size is way too big and it does not have any shape to it."
1.0,"Two pair broke on the first day. I was excited to see these as they are quite stylish. However, they are junk. The first pair broke within 2-3 hours. I'm not tough on my readers, I usually put them on and leave them on. I figured it was a fluke.<br /><br />Second pair had the same thing happen a few hours later.<br /><br />I threw them out and won't buy readers from the misc merchants on Amazon anymore."
1.0,Arrived used smelled like laundry detergent and the stitches were coming off inside the hat.
1.0,Terrible! Half of the black filters were off the masks and upon arrival and first wash more fell out.
1.0,"I liked these leggings when I first got them. The fabric was on the thin side, but they weren't very see through which was my main concern. I wore these only 3 times before the seam came undone right down the middle of the butt. I was out riding a bike when it happened and had to tie a shirt around my waist just to not give everyone I passed a view of my bare butt. Horrible quality, very disappointed. Would not recommend."
1.0,"NOT AS IT SEEMS, VERY CHEAP MATERIAL, LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE, I HAVE RETURNED THIS ITEM. AND I WILL NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER EVER AGAIN."
1.0,"Interior fur has film coating of some kind that smears lenses when placed inside each time. Unable to clean, and have had not seen a response. Finally went back to a regular case."
1.0,Very bad quality!! I returned right away. Don’t buy it.
1.0,Ordered the Black rainbow stripe in XS for my teen daughter. She didn't even try them on because the fabric was see-through when held up to the light. Should have paid attention to the other review that said the same thing. Very thin material.
1.0,"THE ITEM NOT EVEN IS THE ONE ON THE PICT, IS TOO DARK, IS A TOTAL DIFERENT SHORT IN ALL WAYS, IT IS A COMPLETE SCAM..IS A PANT CUT OFF.IS NOT THE SAME ITEM ,PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM"
1.0,I am a plus size woman and usually a 3x top is VERY roomy for me. This shirt was SO tight! I know it's supposed to be form fitting but I didn't know it was supposed to feel like you were trying to be a stuffed sausage! I Would Reccomend making a better description of the clothing for future references.
1.0,Purchased my daughter this 4th of July outfit in advance and when I went to put it on her noticed one of the strings was chopped/ too short 😖 came defective and it’s too late to return

1.0,Fake gold sticks to magnet
1.0,[[VIDEOID:cfabe8bdb6150ce48d6681e8c93708b6]] Yo pensé que era diferente<br />Es súper liviano viene enrollado y no ay forma de desarugarlo<br />Muy mala calidad estoy muy decepsinada
1.0,Looks good. Color bleeds through to clothes even after an entire summer of wearing... the color bleeds through onto shorts/ pants. Ruined every pair of pants or shorts that I wore with them. Put a rusty ring around every pair that will not wash out.
1.0,"Key hole in front is off putting, makes cleavage look weird"
1.0,The seam was coming out of the brim on the second day of use. I usually love Scala hats but this one is terrible.
1.0,Returned for refund.  Not as advertised. Only one star because you have to give it a star.  Should be zero.
1.0,"Very large and clunky,and looks very cheap. I will never wear it and sure would never recommend it"
1.0,Have worn a 6.5 all my adult life.  I could literally not get my foot into this shoe.
1.0,Highly disappointed!
1.0,Seriously read all the other reviews. It’s not the right size and no where near the length it has listed. Don’t get me started on the material. More like a shirt with a open front. Awful!
1.0,I wear a size small top and size 4 bottom. I ordered a large becuase I wanted a loose comfy sweater I could layer. It's super tight...I these may be youth sizes becuase its definitely NOT women's.
1.0,The mechanism that holds it together fell apart only after wearing it a few times. I recommend a stronger belt because this is a waste of money and I would like a refund
1.0,"Short torso, not flattering."
1.0,I bought this as a birthday gift.  I have not even given it to my person yet and the chain is all tarnished.  The pendant is adorable but I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the chain.  I have to go find a new chain.  I cannot give this one as a gift.  It looks terrible.
1.0,This is extremely oversized...as in big enough to fit a large man!!! Very disappointed and hope to be able to have a tailor downsize it and salvage it for my needs. On the positive side the fabric is heavy and I imagine it will be warm.
1.0,It's cool but definitely not worth what I paid for them change color as soon as I took a shower
1.0,Didn’t like this band. Wasn’t working for me :-/
1.0,Don’t order this the size runs very small I ordered 3 sizes bigger and it’s still very small!

1.0,"BUYER BEWARE! Used this suitcase for one trip and on the second one, the inside zipper broke with very little effort and hours later the handle wouldn’t retract, so is now stuck in the “up” position. (And airlines won’t check your bag with a broken handle!) Amazon, wonderful as ever, refunded my purchase after I called about this issue, but I’d steer away from wasting your money on this poorly made suitecase! Terrible thing to have to deal with while on the road."
1.0,It fell apart within a day. It stinks!
1.0,Will only fit an adult small head of about 4ft tall. Too tight for a 5'5' adult.
1.0,Horribles. Tamaño exagerado. Y poco delicados.
1.0,Very thin probably slightly thinner than a condom. Tear very easily. Box arrived busted open since it was gloves I didn't mind. Description of industrial use I believe is inaccurate.
1.0,"I know they're cheap items, but they don't even fit my 8 year old nephew, much less an adult man. Terrible quality, worse sizing, neither will work at all. I'd give zero stars, and for our of my way to recommend NOT to get these."
1.0,This bracelet broke immediately
1.0,The rating is based on sizing.  I’m a 32 waist so ordered large based on their sizing.  Outer shorts layer fit is good.  Waist is good.  Inner spandex layer is baggy and loose.
1.0,It’s not very adjustable so it may fit or it may not. I’m my case it did not. It’s also very cheap looking and feeling. Waste of money.
1.0,"The quality  of the band of this wacht is ""very poor  quality"" The repair cost is $52.92 through CASIO COMP. Wacht cost $98.00 to $120.00"
1.0,"The color was pretty, style was nice, but poorly made, very, very  small in the arm and shoulder area."
1.0,Short as heck. For petites only
1.0,Not what i was expecting. The material sucks. It's like wearing a camping tent. The colors are bright and as pictured but the material is lacking so it makes it unwearable. I really wanted to like this but it's not do-able. :-/
1.0,It’s cut but it arrived with the pain already chipping of.  Why sell a product that is clearly damaged.
1.0,Small is bad inside and not perfect fix on head
1.0,"Im 5&#34;1 tall and 145LBS and ordered XL The bottom piece fits well but the top is ridiculously big, not for small busted."
1.0,Way larger then it looked. Longer too.
1.0,The material feels paper thin and the breast area is made funny.  I’m returning it!!
1.0,all 3 fit differently. They were either too small in the back or too big in the front. Not pleased! Plus the material was hard and rough.
1.0,I can't review this product it was not in the box with the index card files sorter
1.0,The design was very cut and material was comfy but the Breasts were very revealing and the bottoms were almost see through.
1.0,These have to be the worst purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon! They have a freakin heel and the bottoms are so hard it feels like your walking on a stone. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!

1.0,Very cheap looking with the unfinished edges.  Returned.
1.0,Very disappointed to receive a defective item.  The wallet was cute.
1.0,I had bought this color of scarf for my sister<br /> So I bought myself one and wore it yesterday.<br />It shed so bad that i am using a lint brush now so I can wash my clothes?
1.0,"They're polarized but because of the strange shape, you can't even wear them with a hat. Extremely cheap feeling."
1.0,Tight across chest. Sloppy stitching. Tag says 100%cotton. False. This garment is rayon. More lies from cheap products.
1.0,Was expecting this to be a roomy sweater and purchased an xl. I'm normally a size 14 and wear a 36 DD. This sweater only came to the mid points on my chest. I'm returning because of the fit.
1.0,It was definitely too small.
1.0,This duster is made from a heavy cheap material that is white on the inside. The stitching looks elementary. There’s no tag on the inside to verify the size. No belt hoops fornthe included belt. I’m very disappointed with this purchase. I do not recommend.
1.0,It is NOT cotton. I can only wear cotton and this wasn’t cotton
1.0,"Ive had it for 3 months and used it occasionally and it got rusty, i had to throw it away"
1.0,"I could not remove the backing of the sizing without damaging the foam, because the backing would not release from the adhesive surface."

1.0,Cannot see clearly through green shades. Especially when sunshine is glaring or when peering into shaded areas.
1.0,They are not velvet. They are junk made with costume satin.
1.0,My daughter was so excited to get this sweater. It was a late Christmas present. She has worn it a few times but has not washed it yet..... the graphics are starting to crack. She is so bummed out. I will update review once seller contacts us about refund. If the print wasn’t so cheap where it was cracking my rating would have been much higher. This sweater is not going to survive a washing which is awful.
1.0,"Not good quality, and run very small"
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter to wear to prom.  I have purchased other inexpensive jewelry on Amazon and have always loved the quality for a one-time wear.  However, I do not like this set.  This set looks so pretty in the picture, but it looks so cheap in person.  I went to return it today, but my window of time to return ended yesterday-ugg.  I will have to donate it to a charity for a little girl to play dress-up with."
1.0,The dress fit perfectly but it was not new and came with a blood stain in it. I don't live in America so I can't return within the allotted time for refund. Wasted  $22!

1.0,Fits weird… arms super low & large with odd tapering & unflattering seams.<br />Also: the yellow is almost like a harsh bright lemon/fluorescent & not the soft butter/banana yellow shown in pics
1.0,Don’t bother having it engraved! The back isn’t smooth in order to see any letters and the charm is sooo small the letter can’t be read. This charm my be appropriate for a a 1 yr old but not the size you would want for a teen or adult. After I had it engraved it was not returnable. Wasted money so tiny I was embarrassed to give it as a gift
1.0,Horrible quality. Very cheap and thin fabric. Threads hanging off all over the place.

1.0,The item looks nothing like the picture nor what was described. The colors are washed out. Black looks like gray & the red trim like completely awful. This was a Christmas present & I had no other options but to wrap it. The sweater arrived on Christmas eve. I would recommend this item.

1.0,This item came broken. Thanks for a terrible Christmas gift.
1.0,"The dress is nice! But, the whole point of me buying this dress was that it lights up. I didn't light up at all. My daughter was so upset on her birthday and I feel it was a waste of money!!!"

However, they won't send him a new one unless I order another one.  Why on earth would I order another one when they sent the wrong one in the first place.  What if they sent the wrong size again?  Not a chance.  I will never order from Amazon or Ebags again and I will disuade anyone from buying from either one of these companies."
1.0,I used the product for everyday wear and workout. After one use of soaking up with sweat the band did not go back to original size. Stretched out too far for a tight fit. In fact my watch was too loose to wear.
1.0,Shoes fit but the tongue on the right shoe was already tearing at the seams so the cushion inside is exposed.  I can see that the left shoe will do the same in short order.  Customers shouldn't have to use duck tape or needle and thread to fix things that are new.  Whoever manufactured these shoes did a poor job.  They are not made well.  Disappointed!
1.0,Arrived late at $3.00 postage due?????<br />Not what I expected.  Cute print.  Lousy fabric  and fit.  Very disappointed.  I have gotten other dresses and so pleased.  Not sure what to suggest
1.0,Cute dress. Very disappointed. I ordered the dress a size larger to be sure that I had no problem with the fit. I purchased it for a special outing and had to go out to find something else to wear.
1.0,Cheaply made.  Mine has threads hanging everywhere. Runs qt least 2 sizes small. Would not buy.
1.0,"Returned them after one use. Unless you only use your finger and thumb, you'll get burnt!"
1.0,This cap DOES NOT stay in place!  Horrible!!!
1.0,"Oh my, this is a cheap purse, I would not recommend it to my worse enemy!!!"
1.0,I was disappointed that the xs was still too big and was loose across the shoulders giving me no support at all.
1.0,I have a 41” chest and ordered a medium. I literally was swimming in material. There is no way I could work out in the shirts. The sizing information is not accurate.
1.0,"I got these for my daughters b'day party and was disappointed. The package got here quickly, and it APPEARS to be a good quality, but the belts were way too small, like toddler size. I had kids ranging from 4-13 and it only fit the 4yos and barely the 6yo. I know they say you could double the belts but if I did that there wouldn't be enough for everyone. I returned the flags."
1.0,"Ok, so I bought this same shirt in different colors, and different sizes. This one I ordered a medium. It is like an extra small. The other shirts I bought in a diff color but a small ended up being huge. So it’s very very hard to tell what you’re going to end up with."
1.0,"VERY cheaply made. After looking through the reviews and pictures I ordered thinking this would be a cute dress I could wear this summer, but I was majorly disappointed when I got my package. The material is extremely thin and almost transparent, and has no give to it whatsoever, and the straps are poorly sewed on and crooked. Feels like the same material as a trash bag.  I'm bummed because the design is really cute, but I'm definitely not going to be wearing it."
1.0,The cheapest peices of crap I have ever seen and purchased from Amazon.  The frames were bent shipped via envelope.. I purchased 6.99 glasses in June that was way better constructed and was delivered in tact better than these I will not ever purchase a sungait product again
1.0,Cheap?????!!!!!!!
1.0,"Item does not have long sleeves as pictured.  I previously purchased this in &#34;red&#34; and liked it very much which is why I ordered in an additional color.  Really, the sleeves can't even be considered 3/4.  Also, the sleeve banding is puckered where attached to body fabric.  Is this a &#34;second&#34; or quality oversight?"
1.0,"The photo misleads you into thinking this is a red classic tartan pattern. When I received it, wow what a mess. Teals and purples, different shades of red extra checkered patterns, way different than the photo. It also smells like chemicals more than a usual clothing item made in China. I am lucky I went with a prime seller and not another one overseas selling it for 8 dollars less giving me pushback about returning it, because it’s going back without hesitation."
1.0,They are not comfortable and break easily.
1.0,Adhesive was not sticky enough to stay on. I constantly was worried it was going to fall off.
1.0,"This shirt looks great, but the quality is so poor.  Don't spend your hard earned money on it.  As soon as I opened it I could see loose thread and seams and literally the second time my husband wore it and entire seam on the side opened.  There's no point in buying new clothes that you have to repair immediately, that's just ridiculous."
1.0,"Not true to size, top way too small bottom ok tho"
1.0,"Poorly made, very flimsy and they smell horrible"
1.0,Fit was ok the fabric was weird. I didn't like the feel of it. Was kinda scratchy
1.0,Looks cute but not a good product. I received my dress in a package that had been previously opened & possibly worn. The ripped package was resealed with scotch tape and the dress had no tags on it whatsoever but the seller thought that was ok to send back out as NEW. Nonetheless I tried it on after trying to figure front from back. So it runs super small in the bust & waist. Also while trying on I noticed small holes in the dress. I have immediately returned the item. Do not recommend.
1.0,Not so good if they get wet
1.0,This sweater was awful. It was cute but the quality was very bad. I washed it one time and I could not wear it again because it got so many lint balls all over it. I tried shaving them off but it was so frustrating so I ended up returning it. Don't waist your money on this because it will not last. You will end up getting rid of it or not wearing it again cause of all the lint.
1.0,Yes its cute but for a 5 year old ! I will keep and give to my granddaughter
1.0,"Gave as gift, I wear XL , this dress is 2XL, was too small!!!"
1.0,Don’t waste your money...even if it’s only $5.00.  The lenses are cheap plastic one of which popped out of the frame within 30 seconds of wearing.  The frames are flimsy.  You get what you pay for .
1.0,small is the exact same size as medium possibly larger. bought the medium first as suggested by other reviews but it was too big so i got the small and it was the exact same size shirt with a different size tag. waste of time and money........ the shirt itself wrinkles easily and i have to iron every time before use and it’s pretty see through. only get it if you’re a true medium and will be wearing something over it
1.0,"I bought this two weeks ago- never been washed and has only been worn 3 times. The zipper is broken. It’s very cute, but not made well. Very disappointed and would love a refund."
1.0,"I'm 5'6 and got a Medium that is too short. Also, material is super cheap and see-through. Pick something else."
1.0,This product was not at all ok it was really cheep and not made well at all
1.0,These are replacements for a pair of NIKE shoes I had for years.  The original laces finally gave in so I decided to buy NIKE brand expecting the same durability and fit.  Big mistake.  They simply wont stay tied like the original ones did.  Waste of money.  I will need to source a different brand hoping they will perform better.  Surprised at this level of quality for NIKE brand.
1.0,Garbage - too tight to fit over the arm - the end of the arm could not fit though and snapped off inside
1.0,Feathers fell off immediately and it was very bendy cardboard made
1.0,It does not look as it is on the picture
1.0,Love the ring- but it’s definitely undersized.  I can’t wear it on my thumb as intended.  I purposely ordered it oversized so it would fit.  Disappointed.
1.0,"It's not the size that I order, my order was size 11 US, but I don't know what was the size, but I didn't return it"
1.0,I was so hopeful. I guess the only positive thing I can say is the case fit well. aside from that the case began fading almost immediately and now the &#34;black&#34; is a pine green. The case is also very slippery and the buttons are very hard to press because of the covering.
1.0,Not happy with the purchase. It was above my ankles (I'm only 5'3) the sleeve area was tight and there was a hole in one of the pockets. Returning the item.
1.0,To BIG for my wrist...very disappointed and will be returning it! I'm a faithful Amazon shopper and was so excited when my package came and then come to find out it was way to big for my wrist and also it wouldn't clasp!
1.0,"Color was a dirty pink, not tumbled cord and mix fabrics. Returned. Just not what i expected."
1.0,This broke after a few months. The large zipper in the back broke first and then a few days later the top carrying strap broke as I was wAlking and all of my stuff fell out. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Not a fan. Material is very different than expects. It’s that cheap scratchy material and almost see through.
1.0,"The resin strap on these casinos only lasts a couple years if one takes it off daily. Well I didn't buy this particular model, the resin strap appears similar across the line. And a new strap costs $85 at local jewelers. Great watch, lousy, planned (?) obsolescence strap."
1.0,arrived with the lens sliding out of the frame. expected better quality ch ck from amazon.
1.0,Slip dress is not spandex nor does it clings to body. It fits too loose to be worn as under garment under a dress. It's more of a night gown or sleep wear. Disappointed
1.0,They are very close to the original size but they are too big to fit in the frames.
1.0,"Much shorter than the picture, and without any of the pleating in the skirt. Much more like a cheap nightgown, and certainly not worth any more than about $10. Kiddo is extremely disappointed."
1.0,The socks are very thin and appear that they will rip very easily. I may have read the description incorrectly but I was under the impression that these were 2 pairs
1.0,The leather bracelet broke only after 3 days of being warn. I thought it would have lasted longer but it did not
1.0,What a waste of my money<br />The materials are so cheap<br />The purple galaxy its a. Photo<br />Printed  With plastic in the top  the chain its really cheap 😡😡<br />Don't. Buy this thing it's<br />Just. A waste<br />Of money
1.0,"These are so cheaply made. They arrived damaged, bent out of whack and the lenses not fitting properly in the frame. Save your $$"
1.0,"quality of the material is very cheap, after 1 wash, it looks very bad."
1.0,Sizing is way off and the quality it's horrible dont waste your money
1.0,Horrible quality. Went right in the garbage.
1.0,Very frágil break easily i will not recommend
1.0,NOT 100% cotton. Liars. I washed them already and saw the tag. Against my religous beliefs to wear mixed fabrics!!!!
1.0,The product was misleading. The description was wrong and along with the pictures. The scarf is not a blank scarf. It's small and and very thin scarf. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,chain was very thin and not long at all.  Broke on first day
1.0,A $5 maybe $10 mask at best. The red eyes are pointless. No tinting or shielding on the inside to shield your eyes. The lights were not even centered over the eye holes. the wiring to the lights was about a foot long so you couldn't run it down your shirt to a pocket or anything. Three of the stubs/horns were misshapen and wouldn't stay in the holes without glue. Pure Junk
1.0,This is a terrible dress. It’s completely see through the fabric is like tissue paper. The seams are clearly very cheaply put together and don’t fall anywhere on the body where they’re supposed to. It’s pretty in theory… but will be returning and not ordering from again.
1.0,Didn’t fit how I expected it too. Disappointed in fabric.
1.0,I wore it a total of 3 times. Never put anything heavy inside and the strap broke.. the over all material of the bag is great but the fabric holding the straps is trash
1.0,This dress is made using 3 different fabric types and the blues don't match each other!
1.0,"This does not look like the picture. It does not flow, It is very wrinkled. It feels like an inexpensive cotton. Quite high waisted with about 5 inches of elastic almost immediately below my breasts. My husband and I agreed it looked very plain."
1.0,There was a blue dot on the bottom green part on one of the earrings. Was unable to use then.
1.0,These rings are very cool and really comfortable. However after wearing one for just one day the outer color peels and fades leaving only the underneath color present. I would not order these rings again considering that the colors only last a few hours at best.
1.0,"Terrible fit! I'm 125 lbs 5 ft 5.. this is just shaped weird. And the thong, is also built weird and crooked"
1.0,I recieved this necklace today at 4 pm by 7 pm it fell off my neck because the chain broke.
1.0,Strange fit & feel.
1.0,No se parece en nada ala foto no lo compren la tela esta fea
1.0,Sent this back was not as big as i thought it was - was looking for something i could carry my IPAD Pro in as well as some other essentials
1.0,Fringe started falling out immediately.
1.0,"I used this wallet for two months and now have to redo my review. When I received it I thought this is nice quality wallet with enough space to store many cards, cash and coins. First what I found is that it has no RFID protection. I tested it and had absolutely no problem to read a card through closed wallet. So don't hope that your cards will be safe in this wallet. Now two months later coins  compartment fell apart. And I didn't use it much at all. I kept few quotes there just in case."
1.0,Al abrir el paquete ya estaba despegados. No me gustó. Los regrese inmediatamente
1.0,I had to return it
1.0,This dress looks SO cute and was extremely disappointed when I tried it on. It would be too inappropriate to share a picture. the front of the dress goes nearly up to my stomach because it is so short. The material was flexible and not as see through as I expected it to be.
1.0,Just received this today and the side of the case is cracked separated from the back. Very poor quality.
1.0,I ordered a medium and got an extra large they dont do returns. Material seems ok soft but wrong size stuck with something that wont fit
1.0,"Gave this to my girlfriend for a Christmas gift. Within 5 days (December 30th), the entire thing is tarnished/lost its rose gold quality. She never wore it in the shower and anything and it looks awful now. Definitely not worth the time or money and anyone who you'd buy a gift for deserves something way better than this."
1.0,"Nice casual little dress, but it is NOT button down.  It is Decorated by buttons.  If the buttons are decorative, the description should say so so I do not buy it to wear after mastectomy."
1.0,"Esta demaciado grande , no está mal el vestido solo los tamaños no concuerdan , al final no supe regresarlo y aki lo tengo así como me llegó"
1.0,Sweater Model has on is very bright and cute The one they send you is not the one she’s wearing. will be returning it for sure.
1.0,It does not fit properly.  It runs small in the arms and legs.  It's a terrible product and I do not recommend.
1.0,"Shorts ride up, no if’s ands or buts about it.<br />Does literally nothing for tummy control.<br />Those were the two basic features that made me buy this skort."
1.0,"It's really bad. They sent the bag and it already was dinged on the fake leather and one gold colored snap was broken, the other missing. I just put into the garbage and reviewed accordingly. They sent me another. I wish they had not because no way will I carry that poorly constructed bag."
1.0,Too big too dark blue
1.0,Watch band difficult to close and runs very small
1.0,"The fabric may feel cool, but I do not want the fabric in my mouth or up my nose! If you want to actually breathe, this is not for you. The worst face mask I have tried, and I have tried many."
1.0,I liked them. but. the quality is very low. after a week of wearing the leg warmers they began to tear. see the photo - a hole on one and loose seams on both. too expensive for a week of use…
1.0,Muy Bonito pero extremadamente pequeno
1.0,Not worth the hassle.
1.0,"If you don't have private parts, this might fit you. If you do, it will crush them."
1.0,"Absolutely not an open back. It’s just a split bottom so it can be tied. Doesn’t breathe well at all, be prepared to be trapped in your own sweat. Okay if you’re lounging around the house or doing really light yoga."
1.0,Looks like a soft cotton in the pics. It’s like grandma polyester.
1.0,"They were soft, rather thin so probably breathable but they were too small. The holes for the legs were tight. Otherwise, they seemed like they would be great if they fit :(<br /><br />EDIT: Gave them to my mom and one of them was torn at the seam."
1.0,"Way tooooooo small!<br />I wear a medium. I ordered an XL. I was able to put them on, but they were painful/too tight."
1.0,It was super cheap. Plastic decal. It was a child size small. Totally not like the picture.
1.0,"See photos above. One is the bag with a real cork card holder laying on it in darker brown. Next is a magnified photo of the real cork. the 3rd photo is a magnification of the print pattern on this vinyl bag.  If you think $70 is a good price for a vinyl bag (it does look good) that's fine. But please know it is NOT made of CORK and the ""sustainable"" an ""eco-friendly"" claims are not true."
1.0,Cheap.  Gold rubbed off after first wear.
1.0,"Nothing like what it is represented as in the pictures.<br />The hardware cheap and poor quality, glue everywhere on the backside.<br /><br />just spend a few bucks more and buy the real deal, I learned my lesson"
1.0,Received a totally different product.
1.0,Looks like plastic
1.0,NOT what is pictured. Buyer beware!
1.0,Cute! Won't last long at all...wore once and it changed colors. But you get what you pay for!
1.0,Did not look like the pictures and did not fit well
1.0,"When I got this outfit it, the top was very very wrinkled, I order a size 5T but it doesn’t have the size on it, it shows 120 on a tag so I am not sure if my great granddaughter will have the right size, I guess I will have to iron the outfit before I wrap it for Christmas gift, plus it didn’t look as pretty the top I thought it would be bright pink, have a wonderful day thank you"
1.0,The smaller one came apart in my hand
1.0,This was scratched very bad and looked like it was use and resold as new
1.0,"Ordered last minute and even used the measurements provided in the size chart. Ordered for my youngest son who wears a 12 months, and my older son could wear the shirt even though he typically wears a 2t. The crotch of the pants was WAY to big (came up under his arms, but the pants would fit in the length! Horrible!"
1.0,ruff and scratchy
1.0,"😭😭😭 wore this for 3 days and it broke! I liked it too so I was disappointed when it broke. If you do buy, make sure to get the rope ones! They cost a lil more but last longer!"
1.0,I was really excited to get these but they run super small and I couldn’t even get them up all the way. They are very stretchy though I would say order probably 2 sizes up.
1.0,I returned this item because it was way to big
1.0,"DO NOT BUY! Don’t make the same mistake I did. These are so very thin and will not provide any protection from covid or otherwise. I opened one & held it up to the light - I could almost see right through it. When I initiated a return, the company had to approve it & responded with a label to print that still required me to pay the postage. I did get a full refund, but losing $4 for a terrible product is not worth it."
1.0,"Thin material, not what is pictured"
1.0,"I bought these fory monoging business and I could've even use them! They are a horrible quality, will not buy again!!"
1.0,"It took 3 months to get this item. I ordered this as a Christmas gift, made sure I ordered early but it didn’t arrive till January. I also thought I was receiving a sweatshirt and it was more of a t- shirt material. also I’m not sure the size was U.S. sizes it looked small"
1.0,I've only wore it twice and the rose gold is already coming off the chain. Pendant still looks okay. I would return if it wasn't past the window. I don't recommend.
1.0,Fabric was too light and came much smaller than actual size fit.
1.0,I buy this but it’s not for michael kors watch access.
1.0,"bodice isnt long enough, it rides up bust. Not flattering this way, disappointed."
1.0,"I love this purse. The design and leather are perfect to me. However, the straps ( the hooks) are poor quality. Both hooks broke within 7 months. Now, I could not even enjoy and use this purse anymore.<br />2nd part of the story. Then I bought a strap in order to use it. I did enjoy it for a bit longer. Then a year later, the zipper broke. I could not believe it. I wonder if hobo just has poor quality control or they sent me a knock off or deficit product. Very disappointed. Will call up amazon and hobo to complain besides this review."
1.0,"After one flight, the luggage was cracked through the hard shell. After the flight back, the entire wheel had fallen off. This luggage is not suitable for any type of travel. I’m honestly astonished that a product could be made so poorly. No amount of handling at the airport should be able to ruin a piece of luggage so that it is unusable. Very disappointed."
1.0,The necklace looks nothing like the picture. Very cheaply made. I wasn’t expecting Tiffany but the reviews are very misleading. I am returning this.
1.0,These things are huge.  Sasquatch could wear them. Product is not worth the money.
1.0,This is way too huge... Very cheap quality..  Work not done properly.. Things r coming off from the dress.. So no to the dress
1.0,Not even close. Way too small. Not accurategly sized based on what was marketed
1.0,Was way too big and doesn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,"I love the concept of these yoga pants.  Love the pocket.  I'm not sure if I got a defective pair or if they are all like this:  the seam going down the side of the leg is messed up.  It doesn't lay flat, like it is sewn incorrectly.  I'm so sad because I really wanted to love these."
1.0,It broke literally within seconds the very first time I put it on. No sooner had I closed the clasp and the pieces just all came apart. Ridiculous
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. Bad quality. Don't waste your money, I wis I would have believed the bad reviews rather than giving it the benefit of the doubt. Waste of money."
1.0,The fabrics was extremely thin and flimsy like material one would find in a child's doll house. Very poor quality.
1.0,Runs small and not that stretchy pretty stiff
1.0,If you’re long wasted this dress is not flattering at all
1.0,"There must be some problem at the fulfillment center with the labeling.  The more expensive ""3 pcs"" package only came with one mask! They did this twice and the return replacements were also just one mask. The ""2 pcs"" package came with two masks. The ""4 pcs"" package came with four masks."
1.0,"It says nickel-free and lead-free, but it ended up irritating my ears the first time I put them in. Would not recommend!"
1.0,"Poor quality material, the beige underneath is very ugly, the arm length is too short, and there’s a big gap between the armpit and the sleeve, very uncomfortable. Looked much nicer in the pictures."
1.0,Charm came off hook almost immediately.
1.0,This product broke within two weeks of having it.  Looks cool but easily broken.
1.0,Ordered these for a birthday party and half of them arrived broken. The party is tonight so now I can’t even wear them with all of my friends. Super disappointed and want a full refund.
1.0,Way too small....like maybe for a doll and/or newborn baby
1.0,"A tad bigger than expected. Tried to wash/dry thinking they would soften or shrink and neither happened. Hate to do it, but gotta go back to Feetures....<br /><br />Update: seller was wonderful to work with and refunded me due to unhappy purchase. Recommend you give this a try if looking for this type of item as the seller is communicative!"
1.0,"Size is VERY inaccurate...TOO small and quality is cheap!,,,Then again, made in China!....I guess you get what you pay for!"
1.0,For the price...which it had been better overall. With price and shipping costs it was too much!
1.0,"Says earrings in the title, but you only get one."
1.0,Going to cut and add to a hat or gloves. Much too small. Also color not good on either one
1.0,They Don’t have the ball on the end and They’re so long it touches touches<br />The inside of my<br />Nose
1.0,Breaks right after return window expired  :~(
1.0,Has very sharp prongs keep cutting my pinky finger.
1.0,Sizes does not match way too big I tried returning them and never heard anything after that.
1.0,Small boot
1.0,These are very short if you are over 6 foot tall they will not fit you
1.0,"The dress was so small, and I wouldn’t even call it a dress... more like a duster."
1.0,These are sooo mis-sized and mis-constructed! I ordered a Large and they were way too tight in the legs and way too big in the waist. So...not tummy controlling at all. AND ordering a smaller size to get the tummy control was OUT OF THE QUESTION because the legs on the size Large were way to tight!  The model in the photo must be tiny and they used hidden clamps (in the front) to make it look like it fit her in the waist!
1.0,"I am completely disappointed because these pants all but except for the snap were nice pants, but the snap does not stay locked."
1.0,"It was too big,thats why i sent back."
1.0,"Didn't get the whole costume no socks ,belt or bow tie, and it didn't match the sizing pants were to big and top was way to small"
1.0,Too tiny
1.0,They fell apart the first day.
1.0,It’s poorly designed
1.0,"Looks good on the site, but a bit cheesy and overly heavy.  Doesn't sit on the ear the way pictured, too heavy and keeps slipping upside down."
1.0,"Could not believe that a woman would create a product like this for women.  It was a bad joke.  The material was worse than cheap and offered no support especially in the back.  No ability to adjust straps, oh, I forgot. There were no real straps, only the balloon like rubber cut outs she called straps.  Totally waste of time and money."
1.0,It is too thick and it bends out of shape way too easily to be any good for actual jewelry. Will try making some suncatchers with some scrap glass beads or something. I should have stuck with my trusted brand...
1.0,Less than half worked!  I would never have imagined that only about 15 worked.  And I wouldn't say that is really &#34;working&#34; more that they would half come on or flicker.  The others were all DOA.  Very disappointing.  If there is another brand I would purchase from them.  These seem to be VERY cheap.
1.0,would only fit chinese ladies  much too small
1.0,"I gave it 1 star simply because I can't give it any lower..... I did  not like the look the feel( it felt like it would fall apart) , I only liked one thing about it, the ease of return"
1.0,Broke too easy and hard to put in
1.0,"Broke the day I got it, not because of me but it's just cheap. What do you expect for $7."
1.0,They are see through :(
1.0,"This sherpa hooded sweatshirt is awful quality. The zipper was broken upon arrival, and the color was quite dreadful. Not a fan at all."
1.0,"Very poor item quality.<br />Must take caution as material used to make mask tear easily.<br />Not intended for reuse.<br />Nonwashable.<br />Strong chemical smell, must allow mask to ""air out"" prior to use."
1.0,Broke within two months of use
1.0,"Cheap, I returned it.  Not impressed."
1.0,Felt cheap! Not like the ones I tried on at Nordstrom!
1.0,I returned the shoes immediately.  They obviously weren't sent to me originally.  They were extremely uncomfortable.  Possibly that is why they were returned the first time
1.0,"Not what I was expecting. They hang lower than what is shown in the picture, but I returned them and had no problem getting my refund."
1.0,The earrings I received look nothing at all like the pictures I saw.  Very disappointed. there is no cat eye just a simple little ball!!! If I wanted a simple little ball I would have ordered a simple little ball.
1.0,Hat wasn't made correctly and the decal was placed crooked.  Find another source.
1.0,"I ordered a size small, it was way too big. I sadly have to return it."
1.0,"Sizing is correct, however it is very boxy. I will be returning."
1.0,"For starters, I thought there were 3 sets of earrings, there were only two. On the morning of the first day of wearing a pair of these earrings, the stone popped out. When I reached out to the vendor, they wanted to charge me a percentage of the original purchase price for a replacement. This was unacceptable to me."
1.0,"This shirt doesn't fit as pictured. I wear normally 16/18, got the 18, but it's huge, too long fits like a bag. I've been trying to return this to get a refund but since it came from China I had to pay out of pocket first to ship back. Very inconvenient doing business with this company!"
1.0,These are child sized. I knew it was going to be hit or miss on them fitting but this is insane. They fit my  5 and 11 year old daughters!! At least my kids will be warm but now the search is in again for a pair that'll fit an adult. If you're smaller than a us size 6 these are for you. Anything beyond that dont waste your money. Really really really disappointed.
1.0,This is NOT for anyone with boobs. So bummed. And the sleeves are big & saggy.
1.0,I ordered an XL so it would be baggy. This shirt is literally skin tight and see through.
1.0,This product arrived and looks dark pink. Not like the color pictured at all. Very disappointed.
1.0,This t-shirts made by chinese they don't  know anything about american sizes but they know very well how to fool us thanks to our politicians.
1.0,The cover is plastic instead of glass. Had it for three days and the cover popped off.
1.0,Extremely disappointed. Horrible quality.
1.0,Honestly the satin boxers did not meet my expectations. The elastic band doesn’t stretch very much. The shorts seem to be weird dimensions and I have a pretty average dimensioned body. They are kind of narrow in width and wide front to back. And the material feels much cheaper than my other silk boxers from Croft and Barrow. The problem is I have worn them and don’t really feel like I can’t return them because I wouldn’t want to be sold boxers that had been worn by somebody else.
1.0,"I got this for my bf thinking that it would at least just work for a year or so but it did not. Looks cheap af, band never stays attached. Awful watch would not recommend buying ever."
1.0,Terrible. Ripped apart. The lace from the stocking just melts off like butter when tugged slightly.
1.0,I ordered a mens large and it was a large for a ten year old girl
1.0,The reviews recommended to order a size up because the shorts ran small. I ordered a size up as recommended and they were still way too small. The shorts fit tight across my hips. The right hand pocket was partially sewn shut. The fabric also felt odd. Definitely returning these as they are not a quality item for the price.
1.0,"This necklace took more than long enough to receive to begin with. It was purchased for a gift off of their wish list. So, I was so disappointed when I received it and it did not look like the picture. I can understand subtle differences, but this has none of the same coloring or shading of the original. I will be giving it to my recipient in the hopes that they will return it for something that is more accurate. For this price, it shouldn't look like something I bought from the dollar store."
1.0,The necklace was pretty but broke while wearing it once. Very cheaply made and a waste of money.
1.0,I ordered the pretty emerald green shirt and what I got was a brownish olive green shirt with the bright emerald green lace embellishment. It looks TERRIBLE!
1.0,"This skirt looked nothing like the picture and it's quality is horrible, I tried it on and the zipper locked and I couldn't unzip it I had to tear the zipper to get out of the skirt.  I will definitely not be purchasing anything else from this company.<br /><br />I can't give it any stars on this review and I'm a very unhappy customer."
1.0,Won’t ever get this again so cheaply made don’t bother!
1.0,"Does not fit 5 yr old, barely 7 and not so well."
1.0,I received a dress that was a lacey white one... But it was for a grandma.... Seriously. The neckline of it would have choked me. And there was sleeves that would have been to my thumbs. What's up with the orders on Amazon being incorrect recently? Not even what was pictured AT ALL.
1.0,Total ripoff. Not compatible with Charge 4. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this.
1.0,Hole in the crotch when I received leggings. I also bought grey pair. Not squat proof.
1.0,This is a really large wallet with low capacity and poor quality.<br />Money clip is not holding well. Colors are fed the same week. Locker is self-opening.<br />Totally agree with this review: http://youtu.be/m8WeRwW76rI
1.0,I wear a size 34 waist usually. I had to exchange these 3 times and size 42 waist was still snug. Material between the 3 overalls I got varied drastically beware who you are ordering from. Some overalls even had different pockets. Really wanted these to be the quality carhartt is known for but feel really cheap.
1.0,very see through and I order 2 sizes up  was big and very difficult to exchange.
1.0,"ordered a 2x and there was no way it was. It fit my daughter whose is a size small! Never order clothes on here, even when it says runs true to size, which this did say, it never does and I end up giving my clothes to my daughter."
1.0,It waz all but wrong the ribbon came of  the flowers started to kome of and washed it and got ugly had to throw it away
1.0,Wish they weren't see through!
1.0,Wore them for a week before the screw that holds the arm into the frame stripped out. Cheap shoddy craftsmanship!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:aa790f49c93564e70805c3f45265fdcd]]
1.0,"Way small. A useful item, but I recommend ordering a size up. I'm a size 4, and this was tiny on me."
1.0,Very dull colors. It looks super faded and nothing like the picture. It is more grey than black.
1.0,"Very poor fit - feet are much too large and upper portion much too small, so unwearable for me."
1.0,"My necklace has started to fade, I have only had it since September of 2018.... I have not heard from anyone to help resolve it, I am under the impression that if it faded it could be exchanged for another"
1.0,"Tight in torso, huge sleeves"
1.0,"I wear a size 5 shoe so I ordered size Small socks.  These socks are for a 6 year old, I was so disappointed."
1.0,Awkward and small
1.0,Only received the anchor tops! No anchor no piercing. Disappointed!
1.0,I returned this item. I didn’t even take it out of the bag. The fabric was terrible. It felt like plastic.
1.0,Way too small. My son is a size 10 1/2 and I bought a 12. We tried it and it did not fit.
1.0,"I am so disappointed in the dress. not only did I get an item that seems to be returned by someone else but the item fits extremely large !  I'm usually a size small I'm 5'6&quot; &amp; 120 lbs. in the reviews the dress is beautiful &amp; i based my  decision on other reviewer's that are the same size as me .  This dress  is extremely long,  and is more like an XL . if you look at my picture it almost goes to my ankles.  Also the sleeves are extremely baggy ."
1.0,"I ordered green, which appears olive/army green in the picture.  The green that arrived was a light sage green.  It wasn’t the color I ordered or was expecting so I returned it."
1.0,Not put together good at all my kid would have done better job ...way too small ! I am a 100 lb women.
1.0,"Terrible cheap product. Looks nothing like the picture. Awful only one star because it made me do it, otherwise it would be negative stars"
1.0,sleeves are super awkward this dress will not fit according to measurements provided it is not well made
1.0,Could not exist for all I know. I definitely didn’t get it though.
1.0,"Wife said it seemed like something you were buying a costume store, and she pulled it out of the plastic bag the fridges are pulling apart, quality was not even there"
1.0,"According to the deception ""Material: 70% Cotton + 30% Wool with high-quality ""<br /><br />However the tag says 100% polyester."
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap looking, and too see-through."
1.0,It’s absolutely adorable...but would fit my ankle. The size description and the actual measurements are not accurate.
1.0,Quality doesn't matter if one cannot get it on.  And it is impossible to get on irrespective of what the ads say.
1.0,The top fit as expected but the bottoms were more like a medium/large when I ordered a small. I don’t like that you can’t order one size for the top and one for the bottom. I have to wear them separately and only use the bottoms as lounge around the house bottoms. I wouldn’t recommend unless you’re buying two to get an accurate fit.
1.0,"It's like a huge sock on my head. I can't wear it with my scarfs or else it will just fall off. I can't walk around with it on because it slips off my head. I don't recommend buying the white one unless you have a large head. I also got the brown one which is too big for my head as well, and has the same effects. Sad..."
1.0,I don't like it not true to size looks nothing like the photo I returned it
1.0,"Total garbage quality wise, no structure. Amazon has an increasing amount of inferior products that come from overseas, mostly China, 99% garbage. Will no longer buy they amazon."
1.0,Received a used dress covered in pet hair!
1.0,Couldn’t even get these shorts on they were so small.
1.0,"My husband has a 40 chest, we have measured specifically for this item. When it arrived the linen pants were the largest pair of pants I have seen in my life. Regardless we were more interested in the Pathan. Sad to say it was way too big for him. We will be returning it :/"
1.0,"These are smaller than they appear in the picture, more of a children’s size. Also, the sunglasses were not ombré, but instead a black lense. Although I was disappointed by not receiving exactly what I payed for these ended up being perfect for my niece. I wouldn’t recommend for adults, but perfect for little girls."
1.0,Well I'm colorblind but that's not hot pink
1.0,"Not an American XL , more like a 12/14 and very slippery like 100% polyester"
1.0,"I bought this dress to possibly wear to an outdoor wedding. As soon as I opened the package, I noticed that the dress was extremely thin. When I held it up, I was shocked how see through it was. There is no way you can wear this outside without being exposed. Will be returning this."
1.0,"Very cheaply made, and not even close in size"
1.0,My daughter loved the wind breaker but it’s extremely small. Be careful when ordering it literally looks like a child size. Couldn’t return it and can’t wear it!
1.0,"Wayyyy too small, these are not US women's sizes. More like little girl sizes."
1.0,Cheap!!!! Don't buy.
1.0,These run small please buy 1-2 sizes up to fit and last at least long enough to enjoy.
1.0,No it WASNT protected enough phone fell and for damage
1.0,Very pretty can not get on your ear when you do it hurts.
1.0,I ordered these earrings twice now in hopes they would work for my bridesmaids but both times I’ve ordered them the earrings have not matched.  I am also disappointed because even though they were prime items and had free returns I had to pay for postage.
1.0,"The post to one earring was broken when it arrived; I live in the Caribbean and returning the earrings is out of the question, it would be too expensive. So I threw it away within 30 minutes of opening the box. These did not work for me."
1.0,Doesn`t work can`t hear recording
1.0,Poor quality. See through. Was not flattering. Returned this. Seller was good about letting me return it.
1.0,The top is cut extra small. You can’t get the zipper up without help and then it won’t stay up.
1.0,What a waste of money. This necklace arrived broken! and looked like I bought it from a gumball machine. Really cheap goldish brownish kind of colored metal and the chain was broken in multiple places. Out of curiosity I tried shining a light on the pendant and that doesnt work either! Cant read any words. This is a huge disappointment. I now I have to waste my time going through the return process. Do NOT buy!
1.0,"This isn't really a band but more of a case. It doesn't snap into the watch's clips. Instead, you push the watch into the hole and then hope for the best as it is extremely easy for the watch to fall out. I bought this as a replacement band for my girlfriend as it is impossible to find original Samsung ones. The watch fell out randomly and now the screen is cracked.<br /><br />The best part is, you need to take the watch out of this case in order to charge it. By constantly putting it into this case and then out of it, you're stretching this awful product even further which increases the chance that it'll fall out."
1.0,"Fake cheap leather, have had my new key chain for less than a week before the &#34;leather&#34; began to rub off like a worn out pleat yerevan couch"
1.0,"This was ordered as a gift for my great granddaughter.  She is a new born.  I ordered 0-6 month, my granddaughter received a size 5. She'll have to wait until she is kindergarten before she can wear it, if not dry rotted by then.  Will not place any future orders with Amazon.  If I could rate a &#60;star, I would."
1.0,"Super low quality and I had to pay for my own return shipping. I ended up very happy with the 5.11 Tactical Rush 72 Backpack. It is more expensive, but when I need a good pack that I know will last as long or longer than I, the 5.11 is worth it! This Pro-Force pack was junk by comparison."
1.0,Boob area to tight
1.0,What I got was very different than what was pictured. Cheap product—wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Seam came undone on the bottom and juul fell through. Also the pocket was to deep so the juul went pretty far down. Would be better if the top of the juul stuck out.
1.0,"Viene un arete sin una piedrita, es decir, incompleto."
1.0,"I sent these back, bc it says it will hold a picture. No it won’t."
1.0,"I ordered these bc I love bling!  They are super cute and just what I hoped they would look like.  Unfortunately, I was only able to wear them three times before they fell apart! You can see by the stamp on the heel how little they were worn.  The annoying part is, I saved them for our vacation so by the time this happened I have no recourse for them to be replaced.  This just should not have happened!  I, obviously, won't be ordering this brand again.  Beware"
1.0,Not the size they say they are
1.0,"They are probably fine, but they are absolutely HUGE.  I am a woman with an average size and shape for a woman, but these should definitely be marketed to folks with much larger size faces and eyes that are much further apart. I am returning and hoping to find something more reasonable sized.<br />The photo is with a pair of readers that I have, to try to show the size difference.  For the progressive to work, your pupils have to be in the middle of each lens.  These lenses are not a type with a horizontal field that progresses evenly across each lens, it is focused to the center of the lens and then lower at the top of the lens, but the sides are different so they don’t work if your eyes are not positioned in the center of both lenses."
1.0,Did not last one month
1.0,I love Peppers sunglasses and have bought several pairs.  The sunglasses that arrived look nothing like the sunglasses in the picture.  The picture must be an error.  I still had to pay for return shipping.
1.0,The tummy control is literally terrible
1.0,"Do not buy<br /><br />First package was tarnished chain, got a replacement and chain is tarnished.<br /><br />Crap quality, waste of money"
1.0,Saw product on qvc initially and was so excited to try the product. I was very disappointed as the wrinkles did not “fall out”. After a trial of the product I quickly boxed up and am returning it.
1.0,The Watch Storage Case arrived yesterday via UPS.  The shipping box was in excellent shape and I opened it in great anticipation.  I found that the internal box (the factory box) had been dropped prior to being packed and looked very un-professional in its presentation. The Case was not damaged in the drop but I found the liner to be stained and coming loose at several points.  I was/am very disappointed in this Case and would NEVER store my watch collection in it.  Since yesterday I have been on-line and found a great Watch Storage Case from a different supplier and it has already been shipped.  If you are loking for a nice Watch Storage Case - - - - THIS IS NOT IT. I am very disappointed in this seller!
1.0,I ordered the Khaki and it's more of peach/ salmon color
1.0,A lot longer than the picture.
1.0,It last me 2 days and the pin that holds the band in place broke. I didn't even get to workout with it. By the way I don't use my watch tight.
1.0,Sleeves era too long and thick!!! Horrible
1.0,"I figured I would get a pair of inexpensive sunglasses so I would avoid having to pay a higher price for a decent pair. Boy was that a mistake. Upon first opening the package, I was pleasantly surprised by how these looked. In addition, these truly are polarized lenses. However, the first warning sign I first noticed was the fact that just opening the glasses created a LOUD squeal from the hinges. They were very difficult to open and created a very loud sound upon opening. I decided to ignore it considering how they only costed $10. Today, I took them along with me so I could test road visibility as I drove. As soon as I opened the glasses, the left side of the frame snapped off. In fact, it completely snapped off as if it were a thin, brittle cracker. It took no force to break and upon inspection, appears to have been caused by the way the plastic was molded around the hinge. At the end of the day, these were $10, but it does kind of suck knowing I could’ve just gotten a pair from the dollar store and they still would’ve lasted longer than these did. (Note: I only owned these glasses for one day! I opened the package to inspect them the day of arrival and did not use them until the next day.)"
1.0,"These fit great, except for the fact that they are too short!  I am 5 ft, 7 inches tall, and these hit at my ankles.  Also, I am quite fit, so am not taking up much room in the hip / rear end area, so the fabric isn't being pulled up at all.  If you like the &#34;highwater&#34; look, you'll love these.  If not, keep shopping...good luck!<br />9/17/2018 - UPDATE:  While I stand by my comments above, I must add that the seller is most attentive, and customer service oriented. This morning, I received an email from the company, offering me a 30% refund on this purchase, as well as their assurance that they will advise the appropriate dept. of the issue with lack of length.  I will not hesitate to purchase from this company again."
1.0,I couldn't get them on.
1.0,Didn’t have a shape to dress. It wasn’t flattering on me. My chest is larger than my hips and it just made me look frumpy.
1.0,The watch did not wind properly and after several times it stopped even working and the gears inside were loose and falling around.<br />I own quite a few watches and this was just a piece of junk.
1.0,I was giving this as a gift for my sister but I was so disappointed that it came broken don’t risk ☹️
1.0,Did not keep mask over nose
1.0,JUNK
1.0,"Ripped. Wore about 7 times. Today, about 2 months after buying the socks, as I was pulling them on, they ripped right on the mid leg portion of the sock. Big hole. Have to throw it out."
1.0,This is beautiful but not sturdy at all I was at work and all of a sudden I was sitting there and part of the watch strap of the diamond were on the floor.  Very very disappointed!
1.0,"The seller states “free returns”, but this is a LIE!  The seller will not pay for a return-instead they will offer a 50% refund.  This bra had no structure, was thin, and just very cheap feeling/cheaply made.  I wish I could give 0 stars.  Do not buy."
1.0,Fits and looks like your little sister's bathrobe. No form of a coat.
1.0,cheap fabric. too thin.
1.0,Waist too tight but the rest was xxlg which I did not order.
1.0,Wasn't as advertised had 2 reorder
1.0,I just received the wrong package. Instead of 50. I got 25 …
1.0,"They were cheap, fell apart"
1.0,the straps arent even centered or even. it looks dumb
1.0,I would rate zero stars.  Glasses broke within first week of use.  Unable to return or exchange.  Would be nice to know that before purchasing.
1.0,"It came dirty. Decent quality but poor business standards. Luckily it washed out, except for a small brown stain."
1.0,it came defective and doesn't open all the way I just tried to use it. I would like a refund but Amazon says its past refund date
1.0,Don't waste ur money and buy this . It was so tight on my belly and didn't stretch to be be comfortable
1.0,Mal estado
1.0,"Not exactly as advertised, seems a little cheaper made. Has a strange smell @ the gold/metal rings around the handlle have broken the second day."
1.0,"I am 6foot 3, 145lbs, the cardigan comes about waist height- I ordered a 3X. The sleeves aren't long enough, and the image shows different seems and edging than what I received. This is truly a $7 product, it says that it is 100% polyester. I was under the impression that it was a heavy weight material like a sweatshirt, however it is extremely light weight and material seems to be closer to a polished stretch cotton. The images allude to a much different quality of product. I am very disappointed, VERY DISAPPOINTED and honestly rather disgusted."
1.0,Not true to size at all!
1.0,It’s very see through and poorly made
1.0,Wayyyyy to short In the front for my liking. I ordered an L considering I wear a medium and It fitted like a small.
1.0,Thin cheap junk
1.0,"This is really bad, it came in a small bad (pouch) which smells really bad, I couldn't wear it. Not delivered on time. I had no time to return since I left the USA the day I go the package. You can see how bad that package looking at the picture of that pouch."
1.0,The sizing is way off! The medium is very tight.
1.0,Not what I expected. Didn’t fit right and I have an athletic body type. Cheaply made. Where is my refund this was sent back over 2 weeks ago
1.0,Size is way to small
1.0,"As soon as I opened the package, the back on one earring broke. Not worth the time to try and send back for another that would have just probably broken easily again."
1.0,Returned. Terrible quality and literally the size for a child
1.0,Long and large and very unattractive on .
1.0,"not as described.  Hate it, hurts.  But I've been in the hospital for almost 5 months and can't return it.  I hav found with Shein to stick with make up, which I love, and maybe jewelry.  Clothes just don't work for me at all.  sorry."
1.0,Not alloy. Feels like plastic
1.0,They're pretty. But they turned my skin green and itchy and it hurt.
1.0,These smelled SO strongly of mold/mildew when they arrived I had to quarantine them in the garage with baking soda for about a month before I could even bring them into the house. They still smell faintly. Not worth it.
1.0,Flimsey material...see thru...not worth the money
1.0,Wasn't yellow like the picture was like lime green
1.0,The package arrived and was shipped in an envelope.  All the posts on every single earring was bent flat.  They were a total waste of money.
1.0,The fringe on this came unraveled after wearing only once.  I haven't even washed it yet! Disappointed as the print was really nice. Poor material.
1.0,This runs extremely small so disappointed
1.0,"These are cheap but more importantly, they are all way too big for midi/knuckle rings"
1.0,Have fallen apart after only 3 months
1.0,The material on the dress is very thin. I think it cross over the chest funny as well. It also runs very short. I’m 5’9” and it was probably 5-6 inches from the ground. I returned it.
1.0,"Came in a ziplock bag, poor quality printed hand cut copy of The Ben Porat Prayer. I doubt the authenticity. Waste of money."
1.0,Do not buy this. Watches you get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store have better bands. Mine arrived with the buckle broken. At least the tool works.
1.0,Don’t buy this mask unless you have an oval face shape like the model because it won’t fit correctly. It should have explained that in the product description .
1.0,Cheap stitching  tore at the seams.
1.0,I would give this zero if I could. I'm 5'4&#34; and the crotch area was only a few inches above my knees. These would only work for a preteen or someone barely 5'. Agree with other reviews how thin they are as well.
1.0,"Wired it up, simple 2 wires, hook water to the shower head and turn water on, water coming out of head. When plugged in,  the body of the head had a 4 second glow, then nothing. I tried to move the switch from hot to cold, it was stuck, would not move, I broke the switch trying to get it to move. I'm sure all of them don't do this, but mine did. Returned"
1.0,Don't recommend. Only had couple months and my top broke. Plastic completely snapped.
1.0,Muy pequeño no era lo que esperaba
1.0,Glasses are cute. Seemed a little small for my 10 year old but she’d still wear them if they didn’t come broken :(
1.0,What a scam.  It looks small in the pics but even smaller in person.  The whole thing is smaller than my thumbnail.  Chain is even tiny.  It's a choker!
1.0,"The shoes looked good when they arrived, but they were very short. No, I don't mean in length, they were not tall enough to put a foot in (they mushed the top of his foot). I ordered wide for my son. My hand barely fit in them. Definitely going back."
1.0,Not true to size at all. You need to go 2 maybe even 3 sizes up. I ordered a 3XL (I dont wear that size) just to be sure they fit and they were still too small
1.0,"Just not the same quality as hoped in photo. Too small bottom. Top just forget it. Not for my body type at all. If you dare, but a size or to up. Cups will shrink. Think your covered? Nope"
1.0,Strap has to be tied by yourself and the knot keeps opening.  The strap is too short I cannot wear it as a crossbody only around my neck dangling in front of me
1.0,Thought I researched this pretty well for the Garmin Fenix 5s and the band did not fit. Frustrated with the findings band too big.
1.0,Cute shoe but it scuffed up after one wear. My daughter is four and is really ruff with her shoes. I was hoping these would be sturdy enough to hold up and not scuff but nope they did. Go with another shoes if you kid is hard on shoes.
1.0,I am about 5'6 and it was just below my knees and the waist was in a wierd place
1.0,It's not a patch it's a sticker.  And very small. The hat also is poor quality.
1.0,I regret wearing these for the first time to an important event. They slid up so I just was compressed under my boobs and my whole belly was hanging. Not sure why there was so much extra fabric. Maybe they are meant for tall people? I don’t recommend
1.0,This watch is cheaply made and you cannot read the day and month at all.  Worthless!!!
1.0,"The bodice top was way too small, even with proper measurements then sizes up for caution, then the skirt was too big? The skirt also had this very nasty stain all over it. It costs way too much money to not be the right size, especially when there’s a measurement size chart, and my measurements fit the size I bought."
1.0,I received the package...no product inside.  Gypster!!  No good!
1.0,Way to small. Even tho I got XXX Large. Thought they'd fit. Guess not. Gave them to my 14 year old sister. Yeah... Small enough to fit her.
1.0,The material is thin. The jacket edges and seem roll so it doesn't lay flat and smooth.
1.0,It broke in the first week.
1.0,These were terrible quality. I bought larger than I normal wear and they were still too tight. And they were completely see through.  Total waste of Money.
1.0,Different then picture I thought it was cotton but I got shilik overall I don't like it I give to my friend!!
1.0,"The material is super thin, not what one would expect for a ""hoodie"". My daughter was super excited about this sweater for Christmas as she is a big fan... now I have to track down something else for christmas... I dont know if this is 'official' merchandise, but Mr. BEAST should be ashamed if it is."
1.0,"This looks promising but is too heavy to stay on the nose. It juts out too far from the face. It also has a funky, old odor. It extends too far down the throat.<br />Don't bother even consider it!!"
1.0,"Runs very small. Strange design, odd fit, weird length. The material is like swimsuit material. I'm 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs, 36D. I ordered a medium. I generally wear a size 4 in dresses. This fit however the top was stitched strange, the length and drape was weird. I'm returning this dress."
1.0,"Looks like a nice hat, but way too small. I'll see if my Grandson wants it"
1.0,"This is not cotton, it's polyester. Please change the item description, it's misleading."
1.0,"This shrunk to nothing after the fist wash. Looks like it will fit my baby, not my toddler. So sad, because they are cute dresses, just don’t hold up."
1.0,Very big for size. Worst part is it was listed as Amazon free returns but as I'm going through the process it's nothing like all the other free returns and will cause me extra time and money to return this. Highly disappointing.
1.0,"Love the style, but too small to hold any ID or cards!"
1.0,Zipper was broken when received but free return.
1.0,This was not a cotton garment as advertised but a completely sheer chiffon.<br />Could be a nice beach coverup but not for a casual day out.<br />Returning ASAP as it’s not what I wanted.
1.0,The material was cheap feeling I did not like it and they would not except it back
1.0,"Too small, stiff, weird neck and short."
1.0,thought it will be as beautiful as my w86 casio -  but the lights for this f91 casio is not working . . .
1.0,"Was a good enough watch, just too loose."
1.0,Nothing like picture but it will have to do.
1.0,"nah. this is NOT it. It rides up, and bunches in one spot ."
1.0,This dress is made of very cheap fabric. The side seam was missed when made leaving a hole. The color looks off as well. I may never purchase clothing on Amazon again.
1.0,I hate it. It has frayed plastic sting all over the seam is lose so you can see the threading. It's very itchy and irritating. I'm very disappointed I was going to the casino in 2 days for my 28th birthday and I can't wear that. The reviews on this dress are dishonest.
1.0,cheap looking and 2 months shipping
1.0,Very very cheap. I returned it
1.0,"Lasted one month securely on the earring. Then started getting loose and would fall out, usually at home. Well today it fell out on the street and now I've lost one diamond stud. SO MAD about this!!"
1.0,Took a walk in 45 degree weather with the gloves on and had to put my hands into my jacket pockets  keep warm after about 15 minutes.  'Nuff said.
1.0,Item was returned. Looked and felt like wearing a hooker fishnet. Not of the quality I expect from Castelli. I question whether it was  Chinese knock-off as I bought from a third party. Always had 5 star from many other Castelli purchases.
1.0,Seam along the index finger ripped and these gloves weren't used much.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Heavy plastic.  Too heavy to wear comfortably, and doesn't stay on.  Buy leather instead for just a little more money."
1.0,I wear it for less than one day. And It was broken now !!!!!
1.0,Totally see through.  Totally.
1.0,"extremely dissatisfied. first of all its not adjustable which by the type of band it is it should be adjustable, then its really hard to open. finally the pins it came with do not have nobs so you can remove the strap or even put it on"
1.0,These came without tags so I was unsure if they’d been worn before. I decided to send them back because I’d prefer something that I know is brand new and never before worn.
1.0,Paper thin fabric rips easily
1.0,Not grey. Purple.
1.0,"Extremely bad product, the most ship plastic"
1.0,Wore a couple times and broke.
1.0,"I own multiple labradorite rings, this was not labradorite. Mine arrived and it was just a black stone, with zero demension to it. The ring itself, not the best quality either."
1.0,"I can't believe they charge $20 for this product. It is extremely thin.  I am actually embarrassed to give this as a gift since it looks like something that costs maybe $5.00. I bought this for my daughter who both runs and has an outdoor job. I am giving it to her since the light weight may be sufficient when she is running, but I am adding gloves to the package so it doesn't look like a lame gift.  I'll be surprised if this keeps her warm at work."
1.0,Cheap t-shirt material. Looks like more of a crop top than a dress. No stretch WHAT-SO-EVER!!!🚮
1.0,Apparently I did not look closely at the measurements because they are too big to wear.  These are HUGE!
1.0,Cheap quality I didn’t like the fit at all.  Also the front pocket doesn’t stay flushed in while you’re wearing it.  Would t recommend this
1.0,I was so sad when I recieved my package.i ordered a size UP AND  They were STILL TOO small!  Because I was in a bind my daughter had to wear them. Ugh the BLISTER SHE RECIEVED. I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED these but I didn't. I will hand them down to her younger sister who wears a 1.
1.0,It said it was genuine leather. It is not a leather wallet.
1.0,I can deal with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; when it comes to quality etc but they falsely advertised a color. I bought this thinking it was burgundy. It lists the color as burgundy and it's displayed on the picture as burgundy. Meanwhile the dress I got was RED. Not a dark red. Bright. Luckily I bought a backup but I shouldn't have to go thru the trouble of ordering and now returning bc they falsely advertised the color. I wouldn't have ordered had I known this was the &#34;burgundy&#34;
1.0,"I am an endurance athlete.  I am fit.  These pants are absolutely NOT squat proof.  They are also waaaaay too baggy.  I am a medium, and these pants fit me like an extra large.  The waist band fits but the legs are way too baggy."
1.0,Broke not even an hour after my daughter put it on and it wasn't even tight.
1.0,"Could'nt use,  returning.  So tight I could'nt insert the eyeglass handles."
1.0,Battery low. Almost dead
1.0,Just a shirt with aewed on patch not a good stitch either for 42 bucks!!!
1.0,Size Large is way too small.
1.0,"I bought the cute orange puff shirt for vacation. I figured before packing it I would wear it one time at work to make sure it fit etc. upon wearing it I noticed a big hole at the bottom and pieces of thread coming undone on the front. It seemed the threading was becoming unraveled. Amazon stated I had to contact the manufacturer for help, I cannot find their customer service. So beware and check right away for fabric issues."
1.0,Threw it directly in the trash can.
1.0,Did not like the style or size.  Returned bag.
1.0,Product is cheap. You pay what you get. Its way too big. Its a traveling bag size. The color is not exactly whats on the photo. Its way too faded.
1.0,This is the worst product I have ever purchased a Amazon. The quality looks like<br />something that came in a Cracker Jack box. It is impossible to see through the glass.<br />  Do not buy this product.
1.0,The fabric is very cheap and the fit runs small and I have to return them.  Of a purchase of over $33 I will receive a $12 refund since they have a $20 restocking fee.  Ridiculous.
1.0,If you have bigger girls do not buy this product. It would not hold up my girls and just looked weird.
1.0,"Up till now I’ve had a great experience with Janasya however this out description specifically said kurta, pants and dupatta but when delivered I did not receive the pants. Extremely Disappointed"
1.0,"Pretty shoddy workmanship.  If you're ini the dark, it might pass for a real tennis bracelet ... that's if you can get the clasp to work so it doesn't fall off."
1.0,I’m going to return this item because it came with wrinkles in the padding and you can see it thru any shirt
1.0,One earing broke after 1 day
1.0,"this dress was washed as to the washing instruction, on cold hung dry when I put it on this morning, the lining had shrunk more that 2 inches and now doesn't go beyond my hips. the outer shell in now bunch at the seems due to this. when I fist received this dress I loved it, it fit the way I wanted it to now I cant wear it in public. I am very upset and disappointed to say the least."
1.0,This dress was cheaply made. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"came with wrong size, very disappointed"
1.0,This product is horrible.  The hinges busted after a couple of months and the wallet isn’t even full.  I really am disappointed for what this product cost.  POOR QUALITY!
1.0,looks like blood red! Ugly  and bright
1.0,"My daughter wore these twice, and the sole came off one shoe and the metal emblem came off the other. Light wear too. Very disappointed."
1.0,"The condition of the garment was said to be new.  I received said garment and upon receipt I noticed:  a.  tag cut off.  Tags don't get cut off if they are new.  b.  It's been worn and washed.  As clothes get laundered some garments get ""fuzz balls"" .  New condition?  How is it new when there are these fuzz balls ALL over the shirt. Worn smell to garment.  Sorry Try again.  Not sending this as a gift."
1.0,Horrible. Buy if you dont have a torso
1.0,Talla muy reducida
1.0,Adjusting the bracelet was very hard.  Watch did not seem to work either.
1.0,WAY too short!!!
1.0,"Unfortunately the band was bent,( an could not be straitened ) an the hat was folded,( creased and could not be straitened)but the hat was the correct size and color"
1.0,This necklace is so long and feels really cheap. I would recommend looking for other products.
1.0,Definitely  not a black out mask ... you can see straight through the mask except for the eye covering which is small.... was excited because I thought it was more of a blackout mask and couldn't see out of it
1.0,"While the band fits and looks great, it absolutely will not stay locked in place and open up on its own all the time."
1.0,Very very thin cheap material...nothing like picture
1.0,This material is like sheer curtains does not look feminine like the photo it appears poorly made and frumpy.
1.0,The name Grateful Dead is cut off. Really stupid.
1.0,"Cute dress but returning. Doesn’t fit right & has a whole in it! Too tight in the Bust & too big in the waist. It just looked weird. My measurements are: 36B/C, 29w, 37h & 5’1” short waisted. It came just above my knees. The pattern material was not as vibrant or cute as shown in the picture."
1.0,I was very pleased with this until it fell apart after being used a few times.  Good idea though.
1.0,This product is so dainty and cute but the sizing is wayyyy off. I bought a 10mm and it is no where near that.
1.0,Es frágil no es good
1.0,This is a blue hat with a black patch.
1.0,"Cut small, tight in shoulders. Bought a size too big, still didn't fit. It's like it was made for the 'my size barbie doll'"
1.0,I'm a size us 18 so I ordered a 3xl thinking it would be just a little big but it was still to small
1.0,"First off, these are SO tiny they only fit my 5 and 3 year old hands.<br />Secondly, The &#34;gold&#34; lasted ONE day. By the second day, the gold was faded and my girls (who were wearing them) had green all over their hands. I threw them away."
1.0,"Dress was received with holes position in the same place back and front. A little disappointed with the product, as what is advertise was not the same in texture as advertise. Colour of the dress is lovely"
1.0,Did not fit properly. Asia needs to make clothes for American women not the size they think they are.
1.0,The fit is nothing like the photo.  I'll be donating this to Goodwill.
1.0,Too tight & really hard to take off. Not happy..
1.0,"Looks cheap as per materials and color, not recommended to others!"
1.0,Cheep what a joke and then in order to return product they want me to pay the shipping. Do not waste your time or money.
1.0,Doesn't look like the image
1.0,"Poorly made knockoff mess. The fabric is not as vibrant as the picture, the bikini bottom straps are thinner and don't lay flat. The bottom strap doesn't even align with the bottom of the bikini."
1.0,Needle does not fit through the eyelet. I am trying to retread a size 6 1/2 boys boat shoe.
1.0,Doesnt hold my heavy hair
1.0,Tag was sewn right to the pants visible on the outside.
1.0,These are not beads.  They have no holes in them to put any string through!  Completely unusable
1.0,Very very cheap material. literaly felt material stuck together. can make yourself. don't buy
1.0,"Fast shipping. Product was what I expected. but the zipper that came on the back broke the first time i true it on. it wasn't that it was small, the zipper was just not properly placed. :("
1.0,Paid to much. Is NOT big enough to fit everthing they say it does
1.0,"Ordered f cup... I'm not sure a B/C cup would have fit in. When working out, I want breast to fit in the cups to provide support. Otherwise pointless!"
1.0,"Tops had holes in them after wearing them 4 times in an indoor pool, 1 hour each time. Can't recommend"
1.0,"Terrible sizing, on my third time reordering, wear a medium in all pants, now going to try a XXL :(  great quality just need the right size."
1.0,I liked the colors plus the pattern
1.0,"Product was at least 2 sizes smaller than expected,<br />I ordered an XL and fits more like a Medium. Too much of a hassle to return, so into the donation bag it will go."
1.0,Unfortunately the latch to the necklace came broke so daddy couldn't wear the father's day gift I waited to be customized for for him.
1.0,The reviews read runs small. I usually buy XL so I ordered XXL. Hips fit fine but legs are too small. You will be disappointed unless you have thin thighs
1.0,I selected a size small. I even emailed the person and told them I needed a small and they emailed me back saying they would send me a small. They still sent a large and the material is completely see through. The dress is horrible.
1.0,Poor quality and sizing runs WAY too big.  Do not buy.
1.0,Dress was not like the picture and sent the wrong size. Plus It took two months to get here...boot impressed at all
1.0,Not worth it. I ordered this thinking it would be bigger. It arrived in an envelope without any padding so the strap was wrinkled and the bag was flat and flimsy looking. My daughter had been waiting for it and her face fell when she opened the package. Very disappointing.
1.0,Rough fabric that does not feel good against your body. I would not reccomend buying these bras.
1.0,These pants are NOT high waisted or true to size. I wear a size 14 usually and a size 16 fit like a 13.
1.0,Not the same shirt from the picture. Bummed because I was so excited about this one.
1.0,"JUNK!<br /><br />I should have read the reviews before buying this, I usually do, but not this time.  I mean, whats to research about a belt??<br />Well, like many others I found out after wearing this belt four times,  I lost as many grommets. Four grommets after four times of wearing the belt.  Yes, I know, you get what you paid for, but I never thought a belt would not last more than four days.<br /><br />Its in the garbage, I'm not going to bother buying grommets and refitting it every time I lose a grommet.  Damn Chinese crap!"
1.0,The silicone tore as I was placing the straps on the pegs. I'm not happy.
1.0,I bought these because they were very cute. I used them twice and then they broke!  The frame cracked and the lens fell out.  Very disappointed.  Would NOT recommend.
1.0,Not cute at all
1.0,i didn’t like it at all. it’s not like the pictures. not an alien dress like i thought. it’s just flowy and personally made me look like i was bigger than my actual size :(
1.0,I wear a medium or large and order a XXL and couldn’t even pull them up my legs. Runs very very small.
1.0,Very ugly.  Polyester material-  took forever to be shipped and when I received it I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your money on this ugly item.  Even after zooming in on the photos--it looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,It is decribed as sterling  double balls.  It is crystal..................not what I thought at all.
1.0,"soooooo bad and i was waiting too long, I won't buy it ."

1.0,Mask was too small - I had to keep pulling it down to see.
1.0,It had bunches of glue sticking out
1.0,"I love how they feel and love the color, however I am returning them tomorrow because they run pretty small. So sad  because I couldn't wait to get them!"
1.0,Letters were too close together and overlapped. Was not the letter styling I expected.
1.0,Stones were out of pendant
1.0,Thin material and much smaller than expected - spend a little more on the better product.
1.0,Flimsy fabric.  tied it in a knot and heard stitches ripping when it got tight.  Could see through fabric.
1.0,No support at all
1.0,It fits a little tight and is not long as I liked it to be. And I think is a bit see through. Plus I was sent a totally different color and print. Returned it and got reimbursed.
1.0,The color is diferent
1.0,"Really, really cheaply made.  Had I seen this in a store would definitely avoid them."
1.0,This hat is huge and it's also crooked. A total waste of $.
1.0,"The owl looks nothing like the picture.. It's also tiny. Will most likely be returning, not at all happy."
1.0,Not flattering . Appeared in picture to have a much looser neck. Just doesn’t fit well.
1.0,"These adhesive bras dont work. They dont stick, fall off right away and a XL equals maybe a small. So disappointed."
1.0,I'm really mad you ruined my wedding it did not come with the shoulder strap  An I'm out of town  not a happy customer

1.0,Runs small and uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,Never got to wear it the zipper came broken
1.0,I ordered a large and when it arrived I bet it would only fit a child.  Also some of the stitching around the collar was coming loose.  I returned this disastrous product.
1.0,Will not order again from this company. The sweatshirt was so so small. Sizing is way off!
1.0,Cheaply made. After a few uses started falling apart. Dont buy.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:adda50b23216f4849efc3b7cbf0d4365]] It came like it has already been opened and no cuff links were included
1.0,These items were returned and should have already been refunded .
1.0,The buckle ripped in just a month of owning this purse. Disappointed. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"At 1st I was in love with this bra. But towards the end of the day, I received very little support because the back is so stretchy that it stretches too much and your boobs will start to pop out of the bottom. Don't if it's because I'm a busty woman 44DD or the material stretches out too much."
1.0,Junk!!!!  I wore it maybe 3 times since I bought it. Broken. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"This purse was so poorly packaged, wait it wasn’t even packaged at all. Look at the picture. It literally arrived like that with the label in the front. Cheap quality, looks like a little girls play purse and it’s tiny.<br /><br />Don’t waste your time buying and then having to return it."
1.0,Color is light and not a true navy blue color so if you’re trying to match other EMS or Fire department station pants they are not dark navy but they fit is as expected.
1.0,product did not work very well
1.0,I have no idea if this was just marked wrong or what but there was NO WAY I could even get this on. I wear a x-large in all my other shapewear so I figured that would be fine. I am not sure that this would have fit my skinny 11 year old. Quality from what I could tell seemed good but I would be in traction if I tried to get it on.
1.0,Cheap! Shirt does NOT match picture at all! So very disappointed! Absolutely DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0,Fits really tight and are short. Not of good quality. Only worn once. Poor quality material. I guess for the price what can one expect..

1.0,Mala compra
1.0,it’s so see through looks nothing like the photo. don’t buy
1.0,Way to small. I ordered a size larger than needed (3x) but it wouldn't even fit someone who needs a large. Very unhappy.
1.0,I loved it online but when I got it it was too small. It fits but it fits to snug. The material is also made of some kind of stretchy material. It’s weird.
1.0,I have purchased watches from Amazon before and have had great buys!  This one was horrible!!  The watch battery was dead on arrival.  They had not posted up the stem so it’s been using up the battery for quite a while.  It does not look like the pix.  It’s thin and cheap looking.
1.0,I think their sizes are for children …
1.0,"there are tight and has a smell, not comfortable at all!"
1.0,Right front pocket was sewn together in an odd way (I couldn’t get my hand into the pocket). Other pair of shorts I ordered from same company was stitched wrong in the seat and didn’t fit properly.
1.0,These totally fall apart after a few wearings - develop holes.  I loved the look and the fit and ordered in several colors.  They all developed holes in random spots and were so disappointing.
1.0,"They sell these like hot cakes in the islands to the tourists, who don't know it is facing the wrong way!"
1.0,These fell apart so quickly that my son had to walk around bare foot part of the day
1.0,I dislike the fact that the middle fell out already.
1.0,$23.00 was a bit much for this cheaply made mess! I will be returning this!
1.0,"This leotard was MUCH larger than any other size 2-3 leotard. My daughter just turned 2, but this won’t fit for a few more years."
1.0,It is wayyyy to big for me. I weigh 103 Ibs and I got a small but it would probably fit a medium!
1.0,Tarnished within days.
1.0,seemed to be good quality just fit was poor for me
1.0,Please do not buy this item .. a waste of your money ..
1.0,"The most poor quality of clothing, it is falling apart. No structure to the garment.  Now i have to go through hassle of sending back."
1.0,Was looking for something similar to a captive ring this jewelry gave me an allergic reaction and seeing I put them in and did not bring a backup pair as I was leaving my house for a reason my piercings nearly closed. Dont know about the septum but DO NOT BUY FOR NIPPLE!!!
1.0,Top to big even though it’s a small
1.0,Way too big even though it says sm
1.0,"So small, made for a child or a doll. Very disappointed. Cute pattern, but so tiny."
1.0,Buckle on band broke within three weeks--money wasted.
1.0,I ordered from this brand before. It was good.<br />NOT this time. The fabric has no substance with poorly sewn edges. Very disappointed.<br />Returning. Do not recommend.
1.0,"While I love my Little Unicorn swaddles, blankets, and bibs, this bag sucks.  If any bottle spills inside, it’s impossible to clean and this bag started to smell rather quickly.  The outside material collects dog hair and fuzzies like a magnet.  While I loved the style and even purchased a matching Little Unicorn Marindale Backpack for baby daddy, they both suck in practicality. The backpack will almost never stay closed, even when empty."
1.0,Over all it is a nice wallet. Holds credit cards real snug. Only issue I had is when the maker of the wallet got off track when stitching. You can see the marks on the wallet.
1.0,"Doesn’t fit, very loss fabric. Gave it away."
1.0,Super duper sheer. Material felt like grandma’s table cloth. I’m a size 6 and this felt like a 4.
1.0,The neck area is too open making it look feminine.  Not happy at all
1.0,"No battery included so you cannot use the product out of the box. For the price, I think they should have included a battery so that you can use it immediately. It does not say in the description the battery is not included."
1.0,The dress I received was NOT the dress that was advertised.  The hemline was straight.  I was not pleased with this dress at all.
1.0,I am a grown woman who purchased online for the first time from Amazon recently and this is one of the products I've ordered. I couldn't wait til' this item arrived. Once it arrived I opened my package and was highly disappointed because I couldn't fit the glasses they were small and child-like. they are cute for a child ages 8 to 12 but not fitting for an adult.
1.0,Does not fit properly at all. The long pieces of fabric attached to the top do not reach all of the way around and I have a 24 inch waist. Extremely dissapointed.
1.0,The watch malfunctioned within 2 weeks of opening. It let out a very loud high-pitched squeal and wouldn’t stop. The button stopped working and there was no info in the instructions on what to do. Our daughter is in tears and had been very diligent about not getting it wet. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Opened the package and box inside. Opened box and there was no watch band!! Just an empty box!!!!!!
1.0,"Horrible nearly impossible to insert picture, don’t buy."
1.0,"Was so thrilled when i received it but to my dismay,the watch wasn't working. I returned it and still awaiting for my refund. The color is very pretty though. I just wish it actually tells the time."
1.0,The dress looks really good but it tore all over the place after 1 wash. I'm upset because it was really not worth it. I had to stitch up the torn areas myself to let my 5yo wear it because she liked it. I would not let anyone buy this quality even if it would be cheaper than what I bought it for.
1.0,"Cheaply made, didn't even make it through one Halloween party."
1.0,Read some reviews so I ordered his normal size. However it ended up not being true to size and being a size or 2 smaller.
1.0,"It’s just a plain cloth neck scarf, does not keep cool at all. If you are looking for something that cools, you’ll have to look elsewhere."
1.0,washed in cold item faded and shrunk did not dry let air dry.  terrible materi.  very disappointed
1.0,Does not fit all ears or clamp to fit
1.0,The battery was dead when we recieved the watch. The only option was to return for a refund. The watch was a gift and would have preferred a replacement. Since the gift giver paid less for it originally I now have to make up the difference in cost. Plus Amazon lost my return and I had to spend an entire morning dealing with customer service.
1.0,"They really looks very cheap glasses , do not seems emporium armany originals , there was not cloth to clean them included. The same with the case."
1.0,Did not fit glasses. Not snug enough on ear pieces. Most importantly the do not float enough to keep glasses afloat.
1.0,"Fit: tight in the bust, circus tent from the bust down. The weird cut at the neck makes it low in the front, high in the back. After the first wash, the fabric wrinkled, hung weird, and was nubby all over. Even after pre-soaking, a small food stain stood out like a sore thumb.This was a total waste of money."
1.0,Does not fit at all even after a wash
1.0,"Product arrived days late. Not properly reflected in delivery and no reason given other than ""a problem"". Seriously junk. Ugly and poorly made. Shop elsewhere. Do not recommend."

1.0,"I dislike the way it looks, not like it's photo"
1.0,very small and flimsy. picture misleading.
1.0,I have bought this jewelry piercing twice and both times the balls broke off and I lost my piercing completely. Major disappointed and recommend discontinuing this exact product.
1.0,"It is too large, floppy and not stylish. I tried to return it but never heard back from seller. I am out of money and this will not be worn😞"
1.0,"I give a thorough inspection to anything that is going through my piercing but I guess I didn't do a very good job this time.  There were tiny threads of the bioplast sticking out at the end so when I put it through, it hurt like hell and irritated/scraped the piercing so badly, I had to treat the piercing as if I had just gotten it. I finally noticed the threads and tried to cut them off but they were just too small and pointy to fully cut them down. Regret this purchase."
1.0,"Cheap fabric, does not flatter, but will just put in charity box. Not worth return postage to bother.  Wont order from this site again."
1.0,"These are pretty earrings, but one of the chains broke off the first time I wore them."
1.0,Don't buy this. It was cheaply made and the sleeves were way short. High water sleeves.
1.0,It came with just the box I recommend that no one buys this
1.0,Earrings sent are cheap looking and look nothing like this!
1.0,"Glasses broke after 3 weeks of wear.  Since I didn't get the box when I expected, I missed the 30 day return window.  Its a shame as the glasses look nice, but that doesn't mean much when the lens pops out and gets lost."
1.0,Just got these for my son they shipped today! Mic doesn't work tried every which way to figure it out absolutely not worth it. Now we can't even get the headphones to work. Now I'll have to pay to send them back DONT BUY THESE! My 8 year old has waited for these all day and its not compatible or working for his xbox one... very disappointing. 😕
1.0,Hoy resibi mi pedido esyam oresiosas las esclabas pero la.Orden era de 10 esclavas y solo me enviaron 5
1.0,My glasses lasted 2 months before one stem snapped off and the polarized part started to debond. Will you consider a replacement?
1.0,Its very ugly...wouldn't recommend buying it
1.0,"Looks different from the picture. Not gold, rose gold or silver. Looks tarnished!"
1.0,"It's functionality is great though it doesn't stand up to any sort of combat , crap materials used on inner core.NOT IMPRESSED."
1.0,No quedo demasiado pequeño
1.0,The material was very thin and cheap did not like it.
1.0,I am very upset and dissapointed with this item.<br />1. I was sent the wrong color I ordered the black and they sent the white.<br />2. It is way shorter and smaller than pictures and description.<br />3. Material is very thin and cheap.<br />Definetly not wort the money. Pictures and description are misleading.<br />I will have to keep it and loose out. For me definetly not worth the hassle of returning it. Don't do it.
1.0,I have had a magnetic necklace for over 35 years and not a single problem. The bracelet I ordered from this company didn't last a year without losing over half of the magnets. Money not well spent!
1.0,"The words on one necklace is not ledgible. Also the opposite side says &#34; be strong not Fat&#34; which is a terrible saying, especially for a gift! It does not advertise that saying either, or I would have never purchased this. I am sending this back! Not happy"
1.0,"doesnt look like it, runs small. feels like a thin sweater"
1.0,Bad screen printing
1.0,This was not for me!
1.0,They slip off
1.0,"This wig is by far the worst wig I've ever ordered. It was so incredibly tangled even taking it out of the bad, and the supposed layers you see in the photo? You have 2 vastly different layers. There would be no saving it. Its absolutely a hot mess"
1.0,The brown color id redish pink in the sunlight.
1.0,"Trash, it's a night gown. It does not fall like it does in the picture"
1.0,"Ordered two, only received one in my shipment."
1.0,Looked like it had been glued together.
1.0,"Horrible. Broke when I first got it, doesn't look like picture (cheap gold look), and screws in from bottom not top"
1.0,It was very cheap looking not as described. I returned it.
1.0,Crappy quality. Disappointed.
1.0,"I know that it was an inexpensive dress to begin with, but it was completely not worth it. It’s very thin material, with little stretch. It provides little to know coverage across the chest. You would definitely need to wear a shirt of some sort with it."
1.0,These arrived wadded up in a dirty looking snack sized ziplock bag. Very strange. I didn't put them on my daughter.
1.0,"These are advertised as compression socks. However, they are just tall socks. This would be a good product if they were advertised as regular socks. This are not compression socks/stockings at all."
1.0,fits way smaller than advertised
1.0,"Pretty much fell apart after I washed it the first time, before ever even wearing it. The quality is so poor that I may never order any clothes off of amazon ever again. Complete disappointment and waste of money.<br />Threads coming out, two wholes, and fabric curling in a strange cheap, externally used looking way before I ever wore."
1.0,I couldn’t even get this hoodie on. The neck / head opening is TINY. I’ve never had an issue like this with clothes before . Very bizarre . I’m a petite woman with a normal size head and neck
1.0,The windbreaker is thin and doesn't keep you warm. Not worth the money
1.0,The heel broke on the shoe when I was trying it on. I tried doing a return but it’s saying my card isn’t valid the same card I used to purchase the shoe with. I would advise not to purchase shoe the last thing I would hate is wear the shoe out & heel breaks in public.
1.0,"I thought these pants looked so cute and unique from the photo- I couldn’t wait to get them! Shipping was quick but I was highly disappointed with the product... I didn’t even try them on. I took the pants out of the bag and the material was so cheap, the stitching poor/uneven... they’re literally the same material and quality of a child’s Halloween costume. Immediately returned. Great idea but terrible execution."
1.0,I was so so excited for this bracelet and it was beautiful when it first arrived. Unfortunately the silver had worn away in about 50% of the bracelet and the brass looking material is starting to turn my wrist green. I was so excited for this bracelet for protection and now just disappointed.
1.0,I loved these until they turned my khaki couch pink! I had worn and washed them plenty of times to the point where it makes no sense that they would still be bleeding. Now I have an expensive couch that I have to try and figure out how to clean. Do not get these pants in color unless you don't care if they stain your other clothes and upholstery!
1.0,had to send this dress to dry cleaner. Awful
1.0,Is arrived defective and was not allowed a refund
1.0,Cute to small sizing list is not accurate
1.0,Was in pieces straight from the package. Took 2 months to receive...
1.0,"Cheap quality, I returned them."
1.0,Some people might love it. But I expected the fit in the photo along with the look. What came was like an ordered vs wish meme. I’m returning it.
1.0,Wide and looks sloppy
1.0,They are not Maui Jim’s that's for sure!<br />They are heavy and bulky.<br />It's a ”no” for for me Dawg!
1.0,"Description is not accurate, I'm 5'4 190 lbs, it was too tight on my thighs. Better yet state it is for petite medium size women. Too good to be true getting 2 for 24.99 leggings that is true to size."
1.0,"Didn't expect too much as they were cheap,  didn't fit well and felt cheap oh well"
1.0,It broke right away. Didn't even get to wear it.
1.0,Fit to tight..
1.0,"Sent back,  the material is polyester and slick,  not like a regular sweatshirt"
1.0,"This product is nothing like the pics, it really sucks"
1.0,Can't fix
1.0,Arrived broken and the color is not a true gold
1.0,Purchased on August. Today November 15th battery daed!!! ok it's a cheap watch but I thought that it will make it at least one year!!!!
1.0,These arrived today and they are terrible. The connectors on the orange one are a very bright white not the pictured black. They arrived looking vaguely dirty as well. I own several of this style strap from other sellers on amazon those are great these are not. But hey I guess it works for the seller as I'm unlikely to mess with returning them for a $4 refund.
1.0,"Material muy malo, es poliéster y los colores no son iguales al pedido que hice."
1.0,"This is not the shirt advertised, in the picture the brand of the shirt its printed on is a Kreepsville shirt. The shirt I received is some generic no named shirt with a huge open neck and weirdly sewn shoulder that puff out. And the screen print on it is printed to low. I am all around disappointed with this tshirt and would like a return."
1.0,It wasn't what I expected<br />Size was way off and fabic falling apart
1.0,"While these are comfortable and stylish, they completely failed at about the 16 month mark. These were not worn daily, only occassionally. Then all 3 pairs started to have peeling finish and on two pairs the frame broke.  And these never left the house, never went in a bag, just sat in a drawer or on a desk. So while I initially loved these glasses very much, I'd say buy something else that's better quality and will last a bit longer."
1.0,Bulky uncomfortable but pretty
1.0,I like them but I just need a bigger size.
1.0,"poorly made, cheap construction. terrible execution"
1.0,I carefully read the description and it said the unrolled length (inseam) was 8 inches.  It is 5 inches!  Damn't.  It is hard enough to shop online for clothes without having good descriptions.  Come on people.  Our virus tests are showing corona is on the rise big time here in arizona.  I am trying to be safe. Not going to the stores.
1.0,cheap and tiny
1.0,BAD ASS AWFUL! Smelly bad human body odor on cloak! Yuk!
1.0,"This looks like a dress but it isn't.  To make matters worse,  the skirt's waistband color is completely opposite of the shirt! Both the shirt and top are wear-alone items."
1.0,Horrible material. 100% polyester. Complete waste of money
1.0,Toooo big!
1.0,This sweatshirt was absolutely disgusting! Looked like it was sitting collecting dust and it has stains all over! Save your money and don’t buy this crap!
1.0,I hate that they don't use regular sizes. Who freaking measures their kids? This was annoying to purchase because it didn't fit properly so I couldn't take full-length photos of my kid.
1.0,I was very disappointed with this dress. I was unsure about purchasing it but gave it a try anyways. The dress arrived on time but without the earrings and definitely not what I expected the dress to look or feel like.  As a former singer this dress reminded me of every chorale uniform dress I’ve ever owned.  The one positive..... it had pockets. 😀
1.0,"Fabric way too thin. Seems more like girl jeans then guy jeans, hole for the button is way too small. Just over all poor quality"
1.0,"They do NOT look like the picture.  I am small so ordered the smallest size available, a Small.  Cheap fabric so tried to shrink, but still huge at the top.  Won’t ever be able to tuck a shirt in, but could wear long shirt over.  They still don’t hug my legs like skinny pants should, though.  The very tiny model in pic must have had professional alterations to have them fit that way."
1.0,"These Slipplers smelled so baddly, OMG!!! I Couldn't dare wear them outside I sent them back . They were horrible!!!!!!!"
1.0,Threw this away
1.0,Didn’t hang right.  Fabric is not very nice.
1.0,This was advertised as shapewear/bodyslimmer. It does not act in that way at all. It is just  an added layer under my dress that made it look bulky rather than slimming. It is not sturdy enough to be shape wear or thin enough to be a slip. Very very disappointed.
1.0,"Both broke, i broke one test out all i did was do a fast slashing motion in the air n the left just crumbled in my hands, my 3yr old daughter broke the 2nd by pretending to slash me on my back n they seemed to just fall apart. Tried to reglue/use plastic wielding glue nothing worked. Do not buy"
1.0,Product was nothing like what was pictured in the add.
1.0,"All 3 times I received the ring, it arrived broke.  Dissatisfied."
1.0,"Horrible quality, inside lining is like a cheap plastic dust bag. This will fall apart in probably a week. Very cheap."
1.0,"The top is not loose and the dress is long.<br />. Size XL, 170 pounds, 5’5"
1.0,Shoes are uncomfortable to wear . Very unbalanced
1.0,"The rivets that holds the bow together looked like someone took a hammer and smashed them like a flat pancake, they would not clasp onto the shoe.  Cheap material and would not purchase again.  NEVER got to wear them because bow would not attach to shoe, what a waste of my money!!! I truly wouldn’t give it one star but there was no option!"
1.0,"I returned them. They are stamped with the size on each sock and the ink from the stamping bleed over the white socks, staining it."
1.0,Had a hole in it.
1.0,Didn't fit like I thought they would. I thought that buying a 2x was gonna work...wrong. make sure to but a size or 2 up if you are too heavy
1.0,The optics are terrible and we're returning them.
1.0,"inferior fabric and construction<br />I have to fix it twice. Knowing that it is going to continue to fall apart, it became playclothes."
1.0,Was much smaller than XXL
1.0,one of the chain links broke the first time I wore it. the links are poor quality and not sturdy. It looked so elegant (worn to a wedding). Luckily I had it for pictures but it was unusable after that.
1.0,need gold
1.0,Very flimsy fabric.
1.0,The whole dress is costume-y in the material and the sheer front with the bra cups showing looks comical. The sleeves are itches and they cut into your back/arms/shoulders and the the skirt is made of the same awful itchy loofa material. Not worth the money even if it had arrived on time. It had been sent to the wrong state only to arrive almost two weeks later and be an utter disappointment. Got it in white so maybe it looks better in other colors but it feels horrible.
1.0,"returned it.  Crummily made, fabric was kind of itchy, but mostly very poorly made - the inside zipper was only sewn into 1/2 of the area it was to fully close.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Our daughter in in Kindergarten and loved these shoes! For about 3 weeks. Then the sole fell apart. So sad. Really wanted to love them. :(
1.0,"The tie came, and it had little brown spots all over it."
1.0,I received this item and the material is rather cheap as soon as I tried to put it on it  Is rippe I also did a return and I haven't received a refund butBasically I was ripped off save your money to find a cheaper option this was way too expensive just to get disappointed
1.0,"I like the fabric but the zipper got ripped off in 2 days. Now, instead of dress I have zipper opened jacket. Lol"
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap!!!!!
1.0,"No padding, no arch support. Super big, one size fits all (not really)."
1.0,"Cheap material. Very, very thin and not comfortable"
1.0,"I would not buy this product. It took over 2 weeks for them to send it to me. Then, when I recieved it, the material and fit was not ad expected. The dress runs small so does not loom like the picture. And the material is super thin and paper like. It is not flattering or cute at all. The picture is very misleading. I asked to return item and get a refund, but their customer service is horrible. Do not buy!"
1.0,This is not a long kimono. It barely hits my waist. Several other reviews say the same thing. Don’t waste your time and money.
1.0,I did not buy  a used shirt!!!<br />The shirt had a snag …no tags on the shirt and it was dirty!!! (Black marks around the snag )<br />I want my money back …sooooo<br />Mad!!!!
1.0,"DO NOT BUT THIS I bought this item November 7th 2016. Have I been able to put this item in my child? NOPE. It is now January 22, 2017 a month after these shoes were supposed to get here. These were SUPPOSED to be a Christmas gift."
1.0,"These cubes are NOT waterproof, as advertised.  Extremely disappointed."
1.0,"very small for a one size fits all, sent it back"
1.0,Chep broke real easy
1.0,Tongue came off on the first use. I should have spent the extra money on quality shoes instead of buying twice
1.0,Disappointed!  Too small
1.0,The “gold” wore off after just a couple times of wearing it. 😐
1.0,Ordered the dark gray and recieved light gray. Feels like it'll fall apart pretty quickly
1.0,Looked to boxy!
1.0,Terrible quality. Leather is cheap and flimsy. Pendant fogged up right away. Have had to fix twice already. Strangely sized.<br />Really disappointed in the bracelet.
1.0,This is not as described or shown in the picture.
1.0,This did not work.  Came wit NO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL..
1.0,"Most disfigured,  awful mis-sized, can't figure how a 2x showed up as a 6x and still couldn't fit. A shameful waste of good fabric,  an almost was that should have been better."
1.0,Way to big for my daughters 8 year old ears.
1.0,"This is the cheapest necklace I have ever seen!  It is no way worth $45 dollars, probably not even worth a dollar.  Very very poor quality!"
1.0,"For being a pricier brand, these do NOT fit a woman's face. They fall off with any movements. The arms are bowed out and don't stay on your face long at all. Very disappointed in these."
1.0,Product is cut small.
1.0,"This shirt/tunic looks like it belongs on a doll. I bought this for my daughter for a vacation gift and had to return it immediately!! If &#34;0&#34; was an option, that's what they would get!! This dress is for little girls, not for preteens!!"
1.0,The necklace is extremely cheap! Both the pendant and chain turned my neck and chest black within an hour!!!
1.0,Poor quality and fits really big. Tried it on and it wasn't worth returning. Probably what they are betting on.  Tossed it out
1.0,"The product information says that I would get 10 packs of 4 LEDs, but they were shipped in bags of 40.  I have ordered these in the past and did receive the 10 packs of 4 LEDs (which was GREAT).  This time I was extremely disappointed with the bulk packaging since these are party favors and I prefer them packaged in sets of 4.  I'm very unhappy with this order as I ordered 2 sets and now have 2 bags with 40 in each.  The bulk shipping does not lend to being goodie bag friendly.  :("
1.0,Recommended size was much too small -- both in length and height.  Had to return these slippers and am unsure now what size would fit.
1.0,The hats look like they are round enough to fit different size heads. But they don't fit on any of the kids heads we got them for. It was a waste of money. Very disappointing. Now we have to make hats out of construction paper.
1.0,Not true to size.. not off the shoulder as pictured
1.0,the ring i received was too big so i contacted them to see if i can get a different size. first they seemed very helpful but after the first mail they completely ignored every mail i sent to them. the ring is not as glorious as the photo and their customer service is just rude. if they weren't going to try to help me from the beginning at least they should say so instead of just simply stop responding to my email and leaving me hanging. i hardly ever write reviews or have this kinda experience with online purchases but i find this necessary.
1.0,"After wearing the ring for a few days, the evil eye(s) disappeared"
1.0,You can find better accessories at F21<br /> Cute concept but the yellow tone just ruins it.
1.0,Loved the dress however after first washed looked awful and had a wear mark on the back.. looked old and worn out. Disappointed because it was a cute dress<br />Tried reaching out but I’m assuming since it was past the return date no one bothered to respond.<br />(Bought the dress for a summer trip we planned that’s why it didn’t get worn or washed until then )
1.0,If you are a XL get at least a 3X had to give to my brother who is like 115 pounds and the XL hardly fit him haha 😂
1.0,XL is way too small. How can I return this product?
1.0,These are beyond cheap looking. Very disappointed
1.0,The watches arrived broken
1.0,The stone in the center was broken when it arrived. Placement of stones were off
1.0,I’m 115lbs so I ordered a small. Should’ve gotten an xs
1.0,"Not even worth the money, it might as well be made out of felt material. Complete waste of money. You’re better off buying a more expensive set"
1.0,"The darker or midnight navy color was just what I wanted and was looking forward to receiving. Unfortunately, when I began to try the belt for size, I discovered that the buckle was placed in reverse position. In other words, it was flipped over. The buckle wasn't removable (it was stitched in place), so it was useless. I had never seen a belt for sale that had an &#34;upside-down&#34; buckle. I immediately contacted Amazon and received a return label to initiate the process of having the purchase removed from my charge.  Online purchase disasters such as this makes me long for the days of going to and finding what you want INSIDE a department store."
1.0,"Great design, fabric, etc but barely fit a woman's head so I returned it.  Didn't come in sizes unfortunately."
1.0,It’s a t-shirt with pleats.
1.0,Turn after a week
1.0,Plastic ring......returnedit !
1.0,Very misleading! The colors in this picture are not at all what the tie looks like in reality. See attached picture I took.
1.0,Looks nice in the picture but when wearing it has absolutely no shape. Ended up returning
1.0,I hope somebody else joy this ring
1.0,I ordered Men's medium. I am 5'8&#34; and 150 pounds. 32 inch waste......after one washing I couldn't get one leg in these.....I gave them away. Apparently for kids not adults.....
1.0,"Way, way to big for any size head!"
1.0,Came packaged nicely and with a cleaning cloth but the first time I wore these the backs turned black. The company said to clean them and they would be fine. I did and it worked but I don't want to have to clean my earrings after every use because they tarnish
1.0,The watch does not work properly.
1.0,It looked nothing like the photos
1.0,Pretty color and style but small and feels like plastic.
1.0,"LOL, this would never keep a button on."
1.0,too much leak on the face once you wear it. and will create a big moist around the mask.
1.0,ITS NOT A TRUE SIZE..I LITERALLY FELL OUT OF THE TOP PART...
1.0,Wore it 3 times.the 4th time is fell apart. So disgusted with this purchase
1.0,The fabric is beautiful and airy but it was too small for me.
1.0,Ordered this dress is the largest size. Mind you I'm a 12/14 and xl in US. I COULDN'T EVEN GET MY ARMS IN.
1.0,"I did not like that in the description it says that this is around half cotton and polyester. It is actually 95% polyester and 5%  cotton. I was looking for something soft and cozy, this kind of material is not soft anymore after washed a few times."
1.0,I couldn't get the folds and crushed hat into shape to even be able to provide a review other than it arrived in poor condition that I couldn't rectify. I couldn't understand how it would get to me undamaged but figured they ust know what they're doing.  Nope.  I would not recommend this.
1.0,The spring mechanism broke after a few months... too bad as I really liked this belt. :-(
1.0,My husband only wore these twice.
1.0,Fabric is cheap and see-through. Seller sent the wrong size as well. Would not recommend.
1.0,When size is 'one size fits all/most' - - this does not include women size 11 or 12.  frustrating !!!!!!!!! I have a 12 shoe size.
1.0,Really cute but it is not silver! It's been only two weeks now since I got the rings and they've changed colour to a brownish blackish colour. Very disappointed!! Smh
1.0,"I got this coat and was less than thrilled. The inside fleece coat doesn't have a place to attach at the neck and wrists, so every time my daughter takes it off the sleeves get tangled. And one of the rivets for the snaps is blocking the zipper, so the inner fleece doesn't zip all the way up...which for a 4 year old is extremely bothersome."
1.0,Paper thin. Crotch seam ripped second time wearing the leggings.
1.0,Received this product with only one ball and the package was broken
1.0,"I've purchased several brands of this type of band and all of them break without fail. This one, however, broke almost immediately after wearing. Their customer service also did not respond to my request for a refund."
1.0,DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT!
1.0,The band broke right away. This is no longer being sold.
1.0,Arrived broken... not like the shipping broke them but there wasn’t any glue where the hinge met the ear arm thingy. Super glued it back but it doesn’t sit right when you try to wear them. They’re cheap... like extremely low quality.
1.0,"its sheer, it rips easily and its non refundible"
1.0,I only received 3 of the 6 pairs?
1.0,Was I my the face of the watch the the face and band
1.0,"This dress was no where near a size 2xl.  I ended up giving it to a friend who’s a size small and it barely fit her. It came without a marked size anywhere on the dress, and no order form of any kind."
1.0,"Cheap, thin, and fragile glasses"
1.0,Could not keep date set constantly trying... Stem broke and it was pretty for the time it lasted ( 6 weeks)
1.0,I thought this product was guaranteed to be made by LiLBETTER! It was sent  made by VIIShow another product altogether!
1.0,Absolutely the worse purchase don't waste your money!!!! Got a few pairs for back to school for each of our kids well they were great the kids loved them for a max of 7 school days only. Than they couldn't charge or light up complete waste of money especially since 2 kids only wore them for 3 hrs a day for those 7 school days . I would give zero stars if it gave me the option!
1.0,The back of these pants don't stay up
1.0,2under sized
1.0,"This product is a mess. I followed the instructions on the product listing to order the correct size (which is for some reason in African sizes) and it still doesn't fit right. It's an extremely weird cut: skinny sleeves, tight shoulders, but a baggy torso? The jacket is simultaneously too short (waist) and too long (sleeves) for it to make sense on most people's bodies. The materials are noticeably cheap and I don't expect it to last many wash cycles. Also, the buttons are loose and make an annoying ""clacking"" noise when you move. At the time of this review, the jacket is listed at $39.99 USD. For that price, you can find a jean jacket or a sherpa jacket of considerably higher quality than this one."
1.0,"This says single tooth but it's for 2 teeth. The image is inaccurate and it actually has a heart on each tooth. It's also incredibly tiny, I don't know whose teeth would fit in this thing. Maybe a toddler?"
1.0,Cheap awful
1.0,"Not real rabbit foot as stated, imitation fur that’s nappy and falling off"
1.0,Inaccurate length description.  I am 5'2 and this dress fits me like a top.
1.0,"My opinion, this is a very cheap quality bag. I'd rather invest in a better quality bag. There is a noticeable decrease in quality from what's shown in the picture. You can find better bags around the same price with better quality elsewhere."
1.0,Do not buy I repeat do not buy this is not a fit for and adult maybe a small small child bought an xl for my 11 yr old and it dont fit her but they did offer a partial refund so I accepted that and gave the shirt to goodwill
1.0,Súper Small! I couldn’t return the shoes on time so I got stuck with a pair of boots. I’ll give them away for Christmas.<br />Cute but run extremely small
1.0,"The sizing on this is WAY off - unless this is a toddler Sasquatch.  I ordered a 9 toddler and it is HUGE.  He won't be able to wear them for some time.  And I ordered purple, but got orange.  Nope."
1.0,"Pearl's fall out,  they replace the ring quickly but same problem. Not worth the money"
1.0,"Too damn small. Too damn tight, Not even my 15year old sister could fit it. Not worth the money"
1.0,"Very thin material, ripped after first wash.  I wouldn’t buy again."
1.0,"Im a 5 ft 3,  145 lbs, 36 dd woman.  The fabric reminds me of sliding a cardboard box onto my skin.  The torso is so short and the peplum makes it look even worse.  I wear a 10/12 dress and this xl was 2 sizes too small and  I couldn't zip it up.  It gives a very frumpy matronly look.  The person before me must have felt the same way as they wadded it up, unzipped, like a piece of trash and rammed it into the bag it came in.  And because the fabric resembles something papery it held onto every wrinkle it was forced into by the rammer."
1.0,"Un producto de tela d e ala calidad, No envían mi dinero y la devolución fue hace 3 semanas"
1.0,I ordered a larger size BUT way too small
1.0,"The lenses are silver, not black like they are pictured. Still kept them since I figured it wasn't worth the return... then one of the lens popped out and cannot be put back in within 2 weeks."
1.0,"I ordered a total of 3 dresses from this company. All fit as expected and were super cute dresses except for this one. For some strange reason the designer thought to make a slit in the back of the dress. Well this is a plaid, button down, short sleeved dress… a slit in the back doesn’t even go with the style. It looks super cheesy. So definitely returning. Might look at others and order others since I had luck with 2 out of the 3 I ordered."
1.0,Still haven't fix pairing issues.  I'm using my dog's Dogtra collar work on my shoulder at 70 thru clothing.  Works great. None of these issues!
1.0,Scratchy on the inside?
1.0,Did’t fit my watch. Sent back.
1.0,It did not fit so I wanted to return it but was told to keep it and was only credited back $3. Smh
1.0,This product felt like the plastic table cloths
1.0,"Ordered an xxl, the jeans I got couldn’t have been any bigger than an adult small. My husband and I both laughed at how comically small these are. Definitely not accurate sizing at all."
1.0,I gave one to my mom and I gave one to my daughter and they turned my daughter's finger green and they turn colors within a week
1.0,Poor quality and cheap fabric. Would not recommend
1.0,Don't like the shiny polyester
1.0,Very very fitted. Not flattering at all.
1.0,"I would have loved this top, but the straps were off to the side in the back so it pulls the shirt to one side."
1.0,"Al ponérmelos se safo un grabador lo malo es que ya había pasado un mes había caducado la devolución, no recomiendo comprarlos"
1.0,Poor quality in both fit and material. Not worth the cost
1.0,"This product is not what is pictured at all! The pic looks like a soft, thin, distressed sweatshirt. The actual shirt is thick, shiny, tough, polyester fabric. I never return things, but I returned this."
1.0,It was way to big and was really thin material not what I expected at all.  Very disappointing
1.0,not true to size at all. I ordered 2 sizes to big and when they came they looked like an xl. Company is a joke and don't like to give refunds.
1.0,"I didn’t like the way it looked on me, I guess I am too short."
1.0,I bought my usual size and it was really tight and really short. Would recommend a size bigger than normal.
1.0,This dress was a terrible fit for me .
1.0,Thought it was cheaply made.  Not really silver.
1.0,I am disappointed that they are too small. Now I need to find out how to exchange or return them.  They came directly from China which was a surprise and a worry due to the virus in China.
1.0,The cut in dress will show of ur lady party. I returned never got my money back.
1.0,doesn't look as good as pic and uncomfortable to wear
1.0,It Is not even leather. As ghe description says. I feel this vendor have stolen my money. I have not used that belt for more than 4 times and I really feel stolen. The quality of the material is very bad and not what was promised and advertised.
1.0,I usually order a large. Ordered XXL after reading reviews. It's still too tight. Shrunk heavily after 1st wash.
1.0,Not satisfied I wanted the Rasta piercing did not get it and its clearly on the picture false advertising.
1.0,"didnt like this at all , cheap fabric.... sizing way too small,"
1.0,It broke within 3 days
1.0,Horrible dress the pink qaa aome kinda ugly salmon color and the shoulders  were way to large
1.0,Too small and too short.  I was hoping it would fit like the picture but the pants came up above my ankles and were tighter than the picture looks.  I’m 5’6” 130lbs.  Usually a size 6 or medium but I found this was too tight all over.
1.0,Way smaller than what the picture shows. And color was way off.
1.0,"When the size increases, only the waist widens and the length does not change. These would fit my waist if they were able to actually be pulled up. Couldn't get them on because the depth was too small. Would not buy again, and am actually returning these."
1.0,Dose not have a loose fit- im a s/m got a large and still fit tight.
1.0,Didn’t like fabric. Too flimsy feeling so returned.
1.0,"I will start with a 1 star on the remotes, I don't think that I'm bad in doing so, reason being is that the remotes didn't and would not work for my garage doors because of the color of the learn button but according to the product info I was told that it would work on all color learn buttons, that still wouldn't have earned a 1 star, but having to go through the company or supplier which instructed me to ship their products back at my expense (1/3 of my actual cost) with tracking to turn around to inform them that the product had arrived at their desired destination so I could get my refund, that alone would of made anyone give a 0 or no star but they got 1 star because had the remotes worked they would of been a good value and easy to use, but the one is because I actually got my refund, final words: please be clear on your descriptions"
1.0,"I loved how these looked and felt. But after a month ALL of the straps disingrated and broke at the base in the front, very cheaply made. I'm very upset, I would nvr buy this brand again. Now I have to see all these brand new tanks. Highly irritating!"
1.0,"Ordered a 3xl got a pair that said three XL on the tag, but fit my son who wears an extra large. Do not order these are not sized properly."
1.0,This product is roughly 2 sizes too small so purchase accordingly
1.0,This does not look like the picture at all!<br />The material is very cheap... poorly made in my opinion.<br />It does not keep the shape of the heart.<br />Disappointed..
1.0,The pajamas came inside out all crumpled up and were massive.
1.0,"So cheap, ugly, don’t waste your money"
1.0,I wear it twice and found the wire is<br />broken. I wanted to exchange but they did not accept.
1.0,The clasp did not work
1.0,"I ordered this band because it showed and described a clasp in addition to the magnetic closure. The band came had NO clasp, just the magnetic closure. False description by seller. I will not order from this seller again."
1.0,"Purchased new, took out of the box today and worn once. Entire bottom of shoe became unglued and pulled away from shoe. Size chart is way off on US sizing. Runs about 2 sizes smaller than stated."
1.0,The material is cheap and the seams aren’t very well placed… they hit at very awkward places that aren’t flattering at all
1.0,"Beautiful shirt. Fits nicely.<br /><br />Same crap sweaty fabric that everyone else is selling ‘cause its NOT RAYON AT ALL!! Not a shred of it. See photo proof 95% Polyester 5% Spandex…<br />So sick of Amazon sellers flat out lying about fabric contents, so that I have to waste my time and return it.<br /><br />1 star for bait & switch shenanigans"
1.0,The product was great the first week. Then it stop keeping correct time. Waisted 10 bucks. Seems more of a hasle to just return it.
1.0,Way to small compared to my other 34c bras
1.0,"Couldn't get it to attach to my Fitbit :( looks cool and all, but won't stay on my watch, so not usable."
1.0,"They look ok and are  polarized. I wore them for about a month before I replaced them because every time I'd wear them they dented my cheeks. If I had to take them off to go in a store, I'd walk around with slightly puffy dented checks for about 20 minutes. They didn't feel to heavy it might have been how the nose bridge was designed. They work fine, just not with my face."
1.0,"Publicidad engañosa, sólo llega la camisa.. Es decir la parte de arriba, no trae pantalón."
1.0,Straps were to stiff.
1.0,"I'm not pleased with the product I received, because I know the shoes are good, but the problem here is that the images shown in Amazon the color was light grey and blue details in the back, but I received a dark grey and yellow details, so there is a serious problem selling a product that is not accordingly to the image shown. For me its too expensive to send back the product, I feel bad and angry because I received other color of the product."
1.0,Not plus a size 5x is extra large
1.0,Returned too short for me
1.0,"Size runs much smaller than usual, at least by 2 sizes. I gave all 3 pairs away. Did like the quality of leggings."
1.0,They broke the first time I tried to put them on.
1.0,Make customer aware that this dress is cut small
1.0,It sure does not look like  an over  $80.00  shirt. 'Very unhappy with the product.  It's not worth the trouble it would take  to return.  I won't buy another Ralph Lauren product from Amazon. Very disappointed.
1.0,Poor Quality thin fabric not good for cold weather and it smells like it was in a damp<br />Warehouse
1.0,"Seams were off. Ordered an Xl, for a flowly look. It would not even fit someone a size 6!"
1.0,Given as a gift one of the bracelets led light did not work. It sucks they would have been super cool if working properly!
1.0,Ordered this and will not wear it. I was sent the wrong color (it's black and floral but not the option that I ordered). The fabric isn't great either and it just doesn't look good.
1.0,"I purchased size XL, but it doesn't fit. It is way too small. The quality of the product is very poor. I'm returning the item tomorrow."
1.0,"It arrived broken. I don't expect super high quality for 9 or 10 bucks,  but I do expect it to lay longer then a day"
1.0,There were not the color pictured.
1.0,"The quality is very poor, completely different from the web photo"
1.0,When the item was received it had 2 big holes in it. The material is super then as well.
1.0,I wear a 14 and a 3X was positively tight. The shoulders were very constricting.
1.0,It tore the first time I used it.
1.0,Items shrank at least a full size after just ONE wash!  They no longer fit.  They are labelled as 100% cotton but the fabric out of which they are made felt nothing like cotton; it felt more like they were made of some form of plastic.  I am very disappointed and suggest anyone looking at these look elsewhere as these are a total waste of money.
1.0,Do not buy this it's a waste of money
1.0,Was cute and helpful at first until maybe 2 months after wearing when the chain tarnished. Not beneficial when it gets worn daily. Needed to throw in the trash recently as it started to affect my silver jewelry chain.
1.0,"No shape, too large. I would not buy again"
1.0,This dress was made terribly. There were multiple holes in the seams. Disappointed because it was cute.
1.0,Would not open the first time I tried to use it . Garbage .
1.0,The material is thin and no compression whatsoever. Very cheap material.
1.0,"Too small, uncomfortable, unnecessary.  Not sure why I bought it..."
1.0,Bad quality and bad maker
1.0,"Claims to made from bamboo but is made from 65% polyester and 35% cotton. The reason I bought them was because they were made from bamboo. Besides not being as described the quality is awful and doesn't fit right. Took forever to receive because is shipped from China, as soon as I received them, I contacted the seller for a return and never heard back and when I finally contacted Amazon I was told I could not return them or get a refund because I was past the 30 day return period."
1.0,The band is attractive and fits my Apple Watch but its length it a little short. This makes wearing it somewhat uncomfortable.
1.0,"While it is cute, bought 3xl and it barely fits my 12 year old that wears a large. Ridiculously small!"
1.0,Love love them cannot wear him the post are we too small and they don't hook in the back would like to get my money back
1.0,It fit as expectedbut was slightly uncomfortable as the thighs were tight but everything else was as seen in the picture. They ripped almost imidatly after puting them on. I was walking around an by the end of my walk their was a ripp in the croch area. I sewed it up an tried again this time i went up a set of ten stares an they ripped half way up the stairs an the whole was in the same place even bigger exposeing the inside of my whole leg. On my walk back to the car both inner thighs had ripped an exposed my butt. It was humiliating. I had to choose to eather cover my croch or my but becuase i only had one sweatshirt.
1.0,"There is no way these will fit hens. The elastic is so short, I cannot even get them on them."
1.0,"Plastic cover for the filter keeps falling off (Yes, I twisted it when putting it on)."
1.0,"This is terrible, not even sewn all the way on. It is nylon and unraveling, cheaply made and cost $20"
1.0,"My wife had a pair of the Tri 9 for running. They had reached their limit on miles so I ordered her another pair, just a different color.  They did not fit her foot like the original pair and hurt her feet when she walked in them."
1.0,Neck length way too small more like a choker
1.0,my necklace broke like the leather just snapped
1.0,These never came. I have written several requests for refunds or replacement to no avail. This was a horrid experience.
1.0,"Cute, way too small. Could barely get it on despite the information stating it was true to size. Seller wouldn’t take it back unless I paid more than I paid for it to ship it back. Make sure you get it big enough or you’ll be stuck with it."
1.0,I had to return them because I have small calf and they were far too wide.
1.0,Not silver. Turned after 3 day.
1.0,"This wallet does not block RFID.  I was still able to use my RFID door card for work while it was inside the wallet.<br /><br />Edit:  Thought I would update my review.  Even though there is stitching holding the wallet together, there is also glue in the seams.  The glue got everywhere, all over my cards and is sticky and gross.  Will not be using this anymore."
1.0,"Sweater is a size small if anything, not an extra large. Not worth it"
1.0,"The reason for this one star is, they wee to small and I did not know I could not return."
1.0,Not sunglasses. Clear plastic lens. Cheap plastic frame. Dollar store product.
1.0,It's cheap and chinzy...as to be expected of a $2+ necklace.
1.0,The arms were to small and it was to short.
1.0,Bummer
1.0,"This Tank Top is advertised as ""slim fit"" and 100% cotton. Not only is it poorly cut, but it's very baggy and doesn't feel like cotton at all. As the pictures show: the tag has been cut, and there was also a strange stain. I feel this is false advertisement, so I returned it."
1.0,"This bag smells like dead fish, I would not reccomend buying it. I have aired it out for over a weeks and used febreze on it and it still stinks."
1.0,"I guess if you're shaped like a Barbie from the 70's, its cute.....the material is really, really thin and cheap, the zipper on the side is awful and barely slides, and it's sized incredibly small.  This is going back ASAP."
1.0,Within 6 days they fell apart. The material is too weak to hold feet securely and the laces are too long they drag on the ground.
1.0,Really small writing . Could barely see . Gold was not shiny .
1.0,rubbish...turns black after 3 days when wet. thought it was a beach jewelry...dry weather beach I guess.
1.0,To small can’t fit in it i lost my money
1.0,"After wearing for a few weeks around the house, the stitches that hold the top of the shoe to the sides are coming out on both slippers."
1.0,"Only wore the sweater twice n has a few holes in it, would never buy from this seller again"
1.0,"Watch loses time every day.  1-2 hours. I am returning it.  It was not a lot of money, but it's my money not well spent."
1.0,Didn't fit at all!!!!!
1.0,"Thin material, had loose seams and strings hanging off everywhere. Sewn crooked. 1 month return window when I bought it for a special occasion ahead of time and didn’t examine until I put it on."
1.0,Not a very quality product. I could wear it after three days.
1.0,"Unless you are 5 ft or shorter, do not buy!"
1.0,Hated the material!
1.0,Look very cheap in person
1.0,The color strip started to come off after two wash
1.0,Took forever to arrive and it tasted terrible. Nothing close to the flavor of coke.
1.0,Item arrived broken I half. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"the item cam in new in box but already seemed too small to fit my wrist.  The clasp was difficult to manipulate I needed to use both hands to open the clasp.  True enough, the item does not fit my wrist which was why I returned the item."
1.0,"They run too small, I ordered one size bigger purposely and they’re still small Not stretchy or comfortable but pretty looking"
1.0,Don't buy. Horrible. Just cheap.  Guess that's what you for that cheap price.
1.0,La calidad de la tela es muy Mala y el diseño no es como el de la foto
1.0,Clasp broke on 2nd use
1.0,Don't work well AT ALL
1.0,"Decent optics with the lens.  However, the frames broke with less than 6 months of light use.  The frame is made from some kind of cheap brittle plastic.  Why they didn't use cheap bullet proof nylon is baffling to me."
1.0,"Was not helpful at all ,needed for contacts and make up. Waste of money"
1.0,Fabric was too see through. And the skirt was different than the one pictured
1.0,"The buttons are super tacky plastic and the fabric is extremely thin. I would not wear this outside of the house. Thankfully, the price was low enough that it's not worth my time to return...YIKES!"
1.0,It was a cute product but it broke right away and the part i put on my dog was gone when i came back outside to her
1.0,the edges are coming apart and the stitching is of poor quality.  I will never buy a cap made by this manufacturer.
1.0,shirt is odd shaped
1.0,Poor quality. Fabric is see through. I don’t recommend this product.
1.0,I ordered the cap sleeve blouse but got a long sleeve one instead. Fits okay but too sheer for my liking.
1.0,"This is a pretty pattern and a soft fabric.  In theory, it is a cute style but it is enormous.  We have this in the 5-6 and my daughter recently turned 7. She is slim - 42lbs and about 45"" tall.  She wears a 6 or an XS-S in most brands.  This has to be at least 2 sizes too big.  It is also very voluminous so that adds to how large it looks.  It came with loose strings and a care tag sewn to the outside on the side hem.  The sizing and quality of this just isn't there.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I have a small face, but these are too small, very tight over the eyes, do not allow you to open eyes."
1.0,Not oversized as in “long” like I thought. More like a stretches out poorly made shirt that took month in shipping!!! Unhappy!!
1.0,Wayy too short and about 2 sizes too small. Pockets in the dress are awkward and stick out. I will be returning.
1.0,"I hate the fabric, fits too lose."
1.0,"Junk, broke during first trip. Was in the garbage before the return flight. Disappointed!"
1.0,Product beautiful but the way they clasp on the back was inferior on one earring. Lost one after an hour of being at work! My office girls looked everywhere and could not find it! Money would of been better spent donating to charity. I will not purchase anything again from this company. Sad
1.0,Broke less than two days. So sad😢
1.0,The material is strange - it catches on everything and pulls.  i.e. your fingernails get caught in it.
1.0,"I liked the look of this keychain, but the rings which hold your keys will slip off so the safety spring on the bottom doesn't do it's job. Also it is very heavy."
1.0,These bras are not XXlarge - they are more like large  cup with a medium band.  I'm sending them back. Very disappointed.
1.0,It broke. I returned and got my<br />Money back.
1.0,Someone ordered this sleeper for my son off of my wishlist and I received a tracking label with no package. I'm not sure what happened or if the item was ever with the label.
1.0,It was really flimsy and the shape was awkward. I tried steaming it and that didn't help at all. Would have been cute though.
1.0,Its not real good. Unsatisfated
1.0,This drunk super fast
1.0,"Los<br />Aretes vinieron oscuros, no sirvieron y la cadena demasiado pequeña"
1.0,it broke and unfortunately it was right when the return time expired so we are stuck with this ring. it is beautiful and my daughter was so happy until it broke. Very disappointing!
1.0,"I ordered these pants and received them yesterday.  They were too big, so I tried to submit a return.  When I pulled up my orders and selected the order for these pants, there was no option to return them.  The listing says that returns are free.  These pants were very expensive at a sale price of $128.82 and now I am stuck with them.  This is a tough loss to take.  I would say that they run a little large.  Don't purchase if you are unsure of your size!"
1.0,This was totally see through. The picture is also misleading about the shape. It is much longer than I expected and lays very flat instead of having some shape to it.
1.0,"I would give this zero stars if it was an option. There is no hem, and the fabric is cut completely crooked. The seam at the top is sloppy and already coming out. Horrible product, awful quality. Do not waste your money or buy anything from this seller. Beyond disappointed, annoyed, and frustrated."
1.0,This product runs small it size
1.0,DO NOT buy!!! The product is NOTHING like the picture. It is like a costume. Honestly! Save yourself the heartache and the pain!
1.0,So poorly made
1.0,Gigantic!
1.0,Very loose
1.0,"Didn't expect much for $2, but it's gold not silver and looks like you could have gotten it out of a vending machine for a quarter. It is long though."
1.0,Was extremely small. The arms claim to be larger and bat wings. Not at all. Cheap sweater.
1.0,"I am sorely disappointed, especially since the ratings were good! The quality is quite inferior (material and cut) and to add insult to injury, it came soiled and like it was almost bursting at the seam from having been fitted/worn by a bigger person! I don’t even know what to make of it...surely not formal attire! The pic might not show properly because of lighting and colour. The sleeves are a tad bit short but doable and the flap might not sit well even after ironing based on how it looks. Considering returning."
1.0,Estaba enredado y al tratar de arreglarlo se partió.
1.0,"When I read the words ""winder knit hat"" the last thing I expect to receive is a thin cap with a bad sticker pretending to be a knit cap. This is, at best, a summer cap made of two thin layers of cotton-adjacent material. It was a real disappointment for what it was billed as. Had it been billed as a light weight summer cap, then sure, I might be willing to give it 3 stars for at least meeting that expectation. but this just totally missed the mark and is getting returned."
1.0,Bad sound
1.0,This fabric is very stiff and the folding makes it bulky. It doesn't lay smoothly over my face.
1.0,Xlarge fits terribly. I wear a large.. body fits fine but arms are skin tight. Trunks coat is navy blue. The picture seems to show a blue. This thing is a bright shade of purple. Does not come as depicted. Decal on the back was stuck to itself and tore. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Way to small for a 11-12.  Size.
1.0,"I was disappointed as quality of fabric was very poor, too small."
1.0,"I admit that when you only pay $25.00 for a sweatshirt you probably shouldn't expect much, but when I tried one of the two sweatshirts I ordered it fit great.  Then I washed them.  The lining disintegrated.  It ended up as lint in the dryer and what was left on the sweatshirt were lint balls on both the interior and exterior.  I think if I washed them a second time I would have a &#34;tee-shirt&#34; weight hoodie.  I repeat: Do Not Waste Your Money."
1.0,Sent it back because sleeves were too long
1.0,"I thought this product was awful. It was short the cups inside were terrible. The prettiest thing was the ruffle on the shoulder, but you couldn’t even feel comfortable because if you bent over it was pulling the front down the front of the bathing suit was lined, but the back was not so you saw Right through your buttocks"
1.0,Be sure you really read the keychain. It literally says “a really gang” at the end....
1.0,I’m 5ft 2in and 160lbs. My order was the medium one in gray. I only put it on once for an hour to walk on the treadmill and the crotch area fell apart. Really poor quality. Returning right away. Don’t waste your time or money. It’s not good at all!
1.0,I did not like the material and gave it away
1.0,My daughter is 9 yrs. old slim and tall I got her the size 10/12 that's her normal size and the suits it fit like a 7/8 I went the next size up witch was 14/16 and unfortunate they fit her now but wouldn't by summer. I return both suits got refund.  However the suits are very cute.
1.0,Disappointed. Broke after one day of wear. The bead broke off.
1.0,misshaped sleeves hate it
1.0,Very Cheap. Not a very good quality.
1.0,The balls wouldn't unscrew off at all.
1.0,"This was the worst fitting dress on me. Maybe it's because I have boobs, but it wasn't good. I sent it back."
1.0,"Fabric is very thin, you’ll need to wear a slip underneath.  The seam at the waist is not even and the arm openings are also uneven."
1.0,s*** made
1.0,Very very very small fitting!!!!
1.0,The loop is too big and causes the extender to easily come unhooked. I had previous ones that were nice and snug. I would not buy this again. I would return them if I  hadn't already misplaced one.
1.0,Granted you kind of expect things to look like junk at this price but I mean it would have been something neat for the kids to have as a watch but the fact that it literally came with a plastic-like case and the colors weren't even close to the picture ... I mean come on.<br /><br />There's solid casio watches for 20-30$ - I expected for 20$ the colors would atleast be right or it would be a bronze case
1.0,"This dress is made for extremely petite women or a child. I love a short dresses, but this fit like a tunic or shirt. Plus the silhouette was too slim."
1.0,Plastic is very flimsy. The hat itself is not bad.  Overall I would not buy it again
1.0,It looked like  it’s made out of a thanksgiving table cloth not blk & gold at all more like yellow & brown..
1.0,does not feel like bathing suit material at all and runs small
1.0,Runs small and tissue thin fabric. Had to return
1.0,Extremely cheap and difficult to put on
1.0,So disappointed in this dress! It's completely see through!!! Do NOT buy this if you're planning on wearing it anywhere but over a swimsuit.
1.0,"This product looked very odd on my body.  I’m very athletic, I think this would look good on a very straight up and down, slim body type.  Also - the material is very thin and it’s not lined, you can see your panties right thru it."
1.0,A junior size at most
1.0,"This is garbage doesn’t work followed the wind up and set time and nothing it’s garbage, I returned the first one I bought and got another one and they’re both not working"
1.0,"Way too small, have to return. I bought a 2 X and if fits maybe like a large. Also fabric felt cheap like it could rip."
1.0,Looks nice on other people but just wasn't my style
1.0,"Item looks good however the hoops snapped a matter of weeks later, I do not recommend this product at all.<br />Poorly made, very disappointed 👎🏻"
1.0,Was not at all as I expected. Very flimsy two of the four pair lost one lense before even removing from package. Would not consider purchasing again and do not recommend.
1.0,"The sizing is way off on this one, two of me could fit, length of sleeves way over my fingertips by 4 in same<br />for the length of gown.<br />Tried to return but I had to pay for shipping! I am a Prime member, I do not see why.!!<br />Not Happy so beware!!!"
1.0,"My daughter loves these bracelets and the character faces, but unfortunately, the bracelet comes undone easily and doesn't stay together to keep on her wrist. The faces have fallen off throughout the day and even the airtag fell out once."
1.0,Not nice fabric. Doesn’t really look like the photo either.
1.0,This broke the first time wearing it.
1.0,I usually fit into an xl and the full bottom only fit over one thigh!!! I didn't even try the top I am a size 14-15 in jeans a 40DDD bra and I am 5&#34;5 this was no where near fitting me. I would get maybe two sizes up...
1.0,Nothing like the pic. More like long sleeved t-shirt material. Graphics are subpar.
1.0,I wanted to love this! But:<br />* Uneven side seams (bulges)<br />* Irregular pleats and puckering on side seams<br />* Defective/wrong gradation of sizes (the top portion of the dress is easily 2-3 sizes larger than under the bust. The back is shorter than the front as well which is reflected in the huge bust)
1.0,Mine was broken when I received it. It's something you could get from a dollar store.
1.0,The fabric was not acceptable. Returning.
1.0,"I loved the look. I bought it for a month-long cruise to dress up my evening wear. During the first week of wearing it, the band broke apart while I was wearing it! Unfortunately the ""return window"" passed while I was traveling, so I lost out on a refund. Don't buy."
1.0,Sits VERY low at the waist.
1.0,"Looked pretty at first, shortly after it started to change color to an old &#34;gold&#34; color (was rose gold). Then, the teardrop fell off the bottom of the necklace and wouldn't reattach. Overall poorly made."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:e26ba8dffeadf7a0369bae90a70cc13b]] Even though these earring are tiny, I would have loved them if they didn’t come tarnished. They look oxidized, nothing like the shiny picture. Returning."
1.0,We plugged it in but no movement at all. Sent it back. Will order another brand and hope for the best. A shame because it was beautiful.
1.0,These were the worst water shoes I have ever encountered. My son put them on and the shoe ripped and the sole pretty much fell apart.
1.0,This is like a spandex material
1.0,I gave this dress to a 10 year old and it fit her
1.0,I purchased a size medium. The tag reads &#34;medium&#34;. The actual  size is probably large to extra large.
1.0,Kids size or too small
1.0,Ordered 2X large. I wear a size 14 misses. Still too tight. Love the color and quality.
1.0,Breast size vs tank size is absolutely crappy. I ordered and XL and I have size f breasts. It appears that the Breast bra within the tank is a size A.<br /><br />I want to return it. :(
1.0,Do not buy this you better off buying a tile for the price and the tile is less of a headache
1.0,"I am disappointed in this product, wouldn't order again."
1.0,Cute little earrings but the clasp doesn't hold at all and the hinge is flimsy.<br />I guess for the price you could risk losing one but why go through the angst?<br />I bought these for my 10 year old and frankly they were larger than I expected so I wasn't too<br />disappointed in having to send them back due to the lack of good craftmanship... she would<br />have lost them the first day as the clasp barely held them closed.
1.0,Item was missing the battery so I had to buy one. Upon opening they looked like they were made for a 6 year old. Super tiny.<br />Also the heating elements were no where like in the pictures.  They were in the waistband of the pants and 2 small strips by each knee . Very strange. It also never got warmer than what tap water would feel like.
1.0,The shoe came apart from the sole within 2 days.
1.0,So cheap material
1.0,I got maybe 3 uses out of it and the foam inside of it started breaking. Not buying again.
1.0,No directions and could not figure out how to attach it to my Fitbit lux.  Had three different people try to figure it out and could not
1.0,This shirt is cheap looking & not form-fitting. Very disappointed. Will definitely be returning this item.
1.0,Cheap<br />Quality
1.0,Colors are not accurate. I thought the navy and orange. The orange is glow in the dark orange it is so bright not like it is reflected in the picture of being more like tangerine.
1.0,Terrible. One broke off the backing during the first wear. Didn't live up to the Swarovski name.<br />Returned
1.0,Poor quality. Chain just twist up. Etch is hard to see  Missing black cord.  Disappointing
1.0,Not very supportive. A little larger than I expected.
1.0,"Very disappointed in bra.  It is described as soft cup which is a very thin, light material.  Found no information in packaging to return."
1.0,"They have really gone down hill, I'll have to find another shoe to work 16 hour shifts in the emergency room"
1.0,It broke the 1st day. The wire came out right after work which was good considering I would have been lopsided lol. I don't have a huge chest I just got a size up and it fit no complaints there. Just not made to last.
1.0,It arrived and it had fallen apart in the package.
1.0,Tiny tiny earrings for a baby.I’m going to return because they are so tiny and the stone came out when trying on.  There nice for a child though.
1.0,Disappointed these Charms is not rose gold and they are plastic
1.0,They were delayed for over a week so I cancelled
1.0,"It is not at all comfortable.  Definitely not for those endowed with ""assets"".  The band is too tight, and it is grapes around the top."
1.0,This vest did not run true to size. I bought it as a birthday gift for my son in law because he loves ice fishing.  He wears a size 2X in his clothing and it didn't fit him. My daughter then tried it on and she's smaller than my son-in-law but it didn't fit her either.  We don't even know if the vest works
1.0,"Terrible cheap material, size chart didn't match up to the fit either, disappointed."
1.0,"So disappointed - loved the looks of this on line but what a disappointment it was when it finally got here. Cheap looking flimsy material inside & out.  Outside looked like it would soak in any wet weather instead of repelling it at all.  I didn't even bother to try it on.  Here in ""Snow"" Hampshire USA we need good & heavy duty to be able to stay warm, dry and comfortable."
1.0,Zipper wouldnt go up and sizing was waaaaay off.  They are going back
1.0,THESE ARE HORRIBLE AND NOT WEARABLE AS THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND THEY DON'T FASTEN WHEN CLOSED. I THREW THEM IN THE GARBAGE BECAUSE FOR THE PRICE IT'S NOT WORTH THE HASSLE TO SEND THEM BACK. DON'T BUY THESE ARE YOU WILL BE SORRY!
1.0,"They are giant frames! Unfortunately, I didn't get them in the mail in time to return so now I'm stuck with glasses that will do nothing but collect dust."
1.0,"This mask makes me look like a monster. Great idea though, but the image is way to big for my face. The mask size is perfect. It's just the image is too big. I am hoping I can wash and shrink it.  Not sure if I will wear."
1.0,The “shirt” part of the dress needed to be much longer. This dress is definitely not made for women with longer torsos. The black only covered my chest.
1.0,"They look like other sunglasses on Amazon, but the fit on the adjustable nose piece is horrible, they keep coming apart every time I adjust them,  and they come off my head with the slightest motion.  They are unusable."
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would, this isn’t even the same shirt as the picture. It’s cheaply made, the sequins are spaced out and it’s basically just awful. DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Smells very bad and strong. Bought this as a gift and will now have to buy something else. No one should wear something that smells like this.
1.0,I did not like the fact that these were cheaply made and looked horrible.  The cats hated them and I only tried one on the dog for a minute before taking it off.  I would have rather paid more and received quality than this garbage.
1.0,"The skirt is perfect! But the sizing even using chart LIES.<br />I am 5'6"", 120 lbs. Average, average average. I'm forever a medium. So I bought up a size per the companies provided sizing chart!? Wrong. Wrong ,wrong!<br />Waaaay too small!<br />But again, if you order TWO maybe even THREE sizes up, the skirt is lovely! And we'll made bc it never popped a stitch as I intensely tried to force it on! Lol"
1.0,Do not buy this product!! I normally wear a size large or extra large but ordered a XXL because I was concerned the set would run small. This clothing set runs so small that the XXL didn't fit and I had to give it to my son. The material feels very cheap and don't expect it to last long. Very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,"Not what I excepted. To big,  cheap material,  was not allowed to return, except to China for about $35 freight charge."
1.0,I did not like the feel of the fabric
1.0,This picture is misleading. My pattern ends where the hood starts. No material to cover my face unless I uncover my neck b
1.0,Didn’t like the fabric at alllll. Cheap quality
1.0,This is not a good product.  It did not fit on my glasses. I have narrowsides to my glass frames and I did not see any warning about that in the description.  They clearly know it is a problem because in the package there are riiculously tiny elastics to use -- that don't work -- and get lost almost immediately.  The one good result from the purchase was that Amazon gave me a credit and I did not need to send it back. So now it is in a drawer gathering dust.
1.0,"I had bought this watches. I read the description on this watch. After i recieve this watch, it made in China. It no water resist.. so dissapointed.."
1.0,The fit was fine. It was just too long. If it was just a bit shorter I would have kept it. I’m 5’3 and it hit at my knees. Liked the color and the feel.
1.0,I didn't buy these off Amazon but at the store like 6 months ago. Same pair... I figured these were gonna be athletic leggings... adidas quality. They were for my preteen daughter... They are thinner than like the cheapest leggings. So so so see through. Very disappointed from an Adidas product...
1.0,I've had these for a few months now and they have started to turn my earlobes green. I'm so disappointed. They are beautiful and my favorite pair of earings but the whole green thing is unacceptable.
1.0,"I’m 5’6 160 lbs and I wear 32 DD. I ordered a large. I’m very curvy. The skirt fits fine (has good amount of stretch to it) however, the top could barely cover a nipple 😑 not sure if they sent me the wrong top or what but that thing was tiny AF. On top of that, the gold isn’t nearly as cute as pictured. In person, It looks more like a black two piece with gold sparkles on it."
1.0,Gets tangled easily while wearing!!
1.0,"I ordered this sweater a couple of months ago and just got around to pulling it out to wear this past week as the weather has gotten cooler. I discovered that the item I received is not is not the item I ordered. I ordered a crewneck cardigan, but received a v-neck cardigan with decorative buttons on the sleeves. The cuffs and hem are also more gathered than appear in the picture. Finally, the color is sort of odd. Unfortunately, because I didn't inspect the item right away, it is now too late to return it. I won't be ordering this brand again."
1.0,"I went ahead and ordered a size larger than what I would normally need, because this seems like a really cute top and I wanted to wear it throughout my pregnancy. Even doing that, it is still too small. In addition, it is way to short to be a maternity top and doesn't even cover my belly completely. Of course, there is no tag inside the shirt, so for all I know, they are sending the same size to everyone. Also, the pictures show significantly more cinching than what actually comes on the shirt."
1.0,Not worth the money. They didn't even fit. Had frayed stitching and were completely too small.
1.0,The dress was cheap and fit for petite women. I ordered a bigger size and it fit my waist but the chest was way too high. Shoulders way too small. The dress was not well made. I tried to return the dress and was informed I would have to get an email from the seller. Seller sent a return address in china. I called amazon and they advised that they will file a claim. Once that happened I received an email with a new address. I never had this happen with amazon before. I did not know Amazon had sellers like this. It was as if I ordered it off Wish. Do not buy
1.0,Was nothing like description. Flimsy Returned
1.0,Came in broken. Cheap made.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Do not waste your money.
1.0,need a very large size heard to wear this.
1.0,"This is very thin material.  The sleeves were super short and tight on me. I'm 5'7"" for reference.  They do not offer free returns.  So beware on sizing/fit before purchasing."
1.0,"Lenses do not fit in frames properly, and did not filter anywhere close to the originals.  Only a few shades from not wearing any glasses at all."
1.0,"Ok I bought this item bcoz it looks good and nice but when I got it I got confused at first no charger comes with it you have to plug it in the usb and then no instructions just figure it yourself…after I charged it used for 2 days then time to charge again ,here the difficult one it’s very very very very very hard to take off the wrist band so u can charge it I almost broke my hand doing it…I probably going to return it ,I mean I have to go through all that to charge it ? It’s crazy I don’t recommend it to anyone."
1.0,The  reason why I give these product the 1 star is because the fabric is super cheap and it give my daughter a terrible skin rash she  wear it for  40 minutes and was complaining the whole time..
1.0,Its not the same vibrant bright yellow shown n picture instead its a dull dead faint light yellow .
1.0,"This is a cute necklace, but the constellation is NOT cancer. Not sure which constellation it is. Gave it to my daughter for her July birthday, but had to order a different one from another company."
1.0,One wearing and the wire fell out and was poking me in my side
1.0,"The earrings I bought 3 years ago.  They are easy to tangle together, and broken immediately after I wanted to wear them.  And the color of the gold fade off, and I did not really wear them yet."
1.0,There’s only 2 backs in the pack. They were loose and one back is bent. I guess you get what you pay for. Very disappointed though
1.0,It says it's waterproof but I jumped in a swimming pool and it  Immediately stopped working.
1.0,This is not true to its size and poorly made. The material is very thin and was ripped when we received it. I do not recommend this.
1.0,RUNS TINY. SORRY I ORDERED.
1.0,Broke immediately with frayed edges. Not worth it.
1.0,These are so cheaply made!! They were not Capri length and they were huge around my ankles!!! I ordered navy blue Capri and got black long length. Will be returning
1.0,Needed a white dress for my 2 yr old fast. The dress was too tight on the stomach and after one wash it shrunk so much that it is unwearable. It was cheap and it did its’ job but I wouldn’t buy it again.
1.0,"Dull color, no sleeve detail, looks like a regular t-shirt."
1.0,These shorts were so small they wouldn't even fit my 10 yr old niece! XL ya right these were so tiny.
1.0,"Ordered a package of three, received a package of two. Not comfortable at all, very disappointed."
1.0,Items were delivered and neither of them were the darker shade as shown. These have sharp edges that will pinch your ears and face.
1.0,The dress was too small and they didn't put the hooks on the back of the dress.  I thought the dress was coming from the US but it came from China.  Never again.
1.0,My son went to try them on and one claw completely just broke apart the very first time he even tried to wear them. Don’t waste your money on this junk he couldn’t even use them.
1.0,The quality of the material was terrible
1.0,Poorly made blouse the top part is too tight while the bottom part of the blouse fit perfect have to send it back
1.0,Received item that was previously opened. It had scratches on it and the power switch was broken. Extremely disappointed as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son.
1.0,I had to return the dress because the buttons bulged!  No impressed with the quality of the fabric either.
1.0,"made way to small for the size it was said to be,,will no longer waste money on these type items!"
1.0,"Got this for my wife and she's a small lady, ordered a small, and when she tried it on, it looked like she was wearing a mangled bedsheet. Had to return because the size is def not correct."
1.0,"I bought this for a recent trip to Europe as my previous luggage set had finally died. I only used the largest of the 3 pieces and it didn't even last one trip. Like other reviewers have mentioned, one of the wheels broke off. You get what you pay for, I suppose, but even the cheapest sets should make it through at least 1 trip. Garbage quality."
1.0,Me gustó pero el reloj no funciona y no se q es las manecillas no se mueven
1.0,The arms of the glasses are easily snapped off. Had them less than two days and now one of the eat arms is almost detattched
1.0,Material isn't super cheap. Dress is cute but dosent fit like the measurements say. Zipper was broken. Got it yesterday and returning it tomorrow.
1.0,Weird design.
1.0,"They were much larger than pictured. Had I not used a gift card to purchase these I would have returned them, but I was uncertain about the return policy. However they were if great quality."
1.0,"Horrible quality, horrible construction. The fit was the least of the problem...Dress was bulky, stuck out at weird angles, didn't work on the top...just such poor quality."
1.0,I have pretty regular sized hands for a female and the stitched broke the first time I tried on the gloves. I loved the design and was surprised by the quality of the materials when they arrived but they broke immediately.
1.0,"Very happy to find these llama pajamas for a gift.  They arrived just as pictured, great colors, correct size, and full of softness.  After one wash, starting dropping fuzz all over, even where sitting.  The material is getting thinner and thinner after wearing and washing only a couple of times.  Wish the material was better quality.  If it did not fall apart, I would definitely recommend, but not as received."
1.0,Did not come with candy pieces
1.0,Faded after 1 wash. Very cheap material
1.0,"This is not a Woman T shirt !  Image show item having a low scoop neck with slight shaped waist. What I receive is a men shirt, crew neck line,  straight waist , sleeve rolled up and hold by a small stitch . Fit does not look any thing like image ! Fabric quality is also not great !"
1.0,"Bad conditions, poor device<br />Bad smell uufff"
1.0,Poor quality. The seam is all crooked.
1.0,"Not awful id you have a SLIM frame.  The suit was NSFW.  Sent back immediately.  Small and flimsy. I am 165, 6'5, 36D"
1.0,Does not fit right. Wanted to return it but did not get to it in time.
1.0,"Nice plush soft pants, but the sizing is ridiculous. Bought a men's XL and wound up having to give it to my 12-year-old, 100 lb daughter."
1.0,Rip off!!  Stealing trademarks and intellectual property!  Oppose this theft!
1.0,"Item was not as described. Short NOT Long like it stated. Could use it as a doily more than I could wear it. Should have know that price was too good to be true. Will keep it for something. Not worth the hassle with a return or credit. I know, maybe the right size for a baby."
1.0,"My review is based on the sizing of the jeans. I wear a size 16 and ordered a 17 in this jeans. I couldn't even button them. There was about a 2 inch gap between the button and the buttonhole. Unfortunately, the highest size they have is a 17 so I won't be able to review the feel of these jeans. They do look super cute though, so I'm a little disappointed that I can't order them in a bigger size."
1.0,I was sent a size that will not fit my Benrus wrist watch.
1.0,Material & style not flattering - not made (crafted) well.
1.0,this dress came and its a wrinkled mess. Cheap thin fabric. Will donate to the goodwill.
1.0,Very cheaply made<br />Definitely not worth$15
1.0,Base on some reviews.  I decided to purchase this dress in size Medium.  But it was extremely big. I am 5'1 157LB 36B bra size.  This was a bad dress. The color was the only good thing...
1.0,Do not make the mistake that I did in buying this product! It is not as described and looks nothing like the picture that they use to advertise this product! Totally false advertising! Not worth the money by any stretch of the imagination!
1.0,Nothing like the photo. Hoops were twisted and only 6 in the pack.
1.0,Disliked the quality. I do not recommend.
1.0,This shirt not only was way to big it arrived with something all over the front of it
1.0,"fast shipping, but not impressed with these brushes, switched back to the normal bristle brush."
1.0,"Terrible goggles, fog like crazy! I had to leave a patient's home to go switch into a different face shield out in my car. The fogging was so bad I could not even see my computer screen! I don't recommend at all, they will not work well if you are also wearing a mask."
1.0,"These are just awful. I bought a pair for husband last month and within 2 weeks the inside heal was blown out. So I exchanged for new pair. He wore the new pair about 8 times now. Husband is in Pest Control so works outside too. So he came 3rd day and said feet ache so we bought a set of shoe inserts. Then 2 days ago took off the shoes and stunk entire room up. His feet got wet and the water mixed in with horrible smelling material on inside of shoes. Then today he came home and showed me the heel coming unglued at the bottom of the shoe. That's it..the shoes are going back again. People need to be told the truth. These shoes are not durable or weatherproof. They leak, smell and tear up on the inside as well as outside. To me they are worth about 5.00 so don't waste your money like I did..twice!"
1.0,It stopped after about 6 weeks.  It would have cost too much to repair. I guess you get what you pay for. I admit it’s very nice looking.
1.0,This thing is impossible to put on.  You would have to have somebody else help you take it on or off.  I assumed it clipped but I was wrong. Worst design for a clasp ever. You have to thread the bolt thru the loop with one hand. I would think that whoever made it would have attempted to put it on at least once.
1.0,This is a joke. Says 2 sizes only got one and it didn’t fit. There was no option to choose a size either. Don’t buy this
1.0,"This is not at all what I expected it to be, in the picture it looks silky and shiny and in person it is not at all shiny, it is a beige weird material nothing close to silk. I’m very disappointed. It’s also super slippery and hard to put on your wrist."
1.0,"Hubby happy, so I'm happy"
1.0,Way smaller the pictured
1.0,Doesnt look like the picture. Low quality material used.
1.0,The wallet did NOT even come in the package. The package was an empty tin marvel canister. Do NOT buy from this &#34;Cool dads toys&#34; 3rd party. I'm so SO mad.
1.0,Runs extremely small!! I wear a size 6 and bought a large and it looks like a size 2.<br />Order 3 sizes up.
1.0,I was very disappointed with the socks I wanted them for a crazy sock theme and when you put the socks on once they go up your calves you can no longer see the design of the sock very disappointing.
1.0,This one might feel okay at first but it’ll shrink and hurt your ears so bad you wish you didn’t buy it. Super thin somehow even though it’s 2 pieces. I wouldn’t buy this again
1.0,Way too small for size listed.  Go up st least 2 sizes from eBay you normally wear.
1.0,"This swimsuit is as thin as a tank top. It was super skin-tight and was not flattering at all. I normally wear a small or medium. After reading reviews, I got a large and extra large to try. Both of them were too tight and were not flattering! This suit is adorable, but so not worth the money!"
1.0,Junk. Too small. Very thin. Cheaply made.
1.0,Wasn't impressed. Edges sharp and uneven
1.0,The worse quality ever. My daughter doesn't wear it all the time and it already has a hole in it . And we bought it less than a month ago. It is not worth  the money.
1.0,"Cheap fabric that you can completely see through, not worth the purchase"
1.0,Colores opacos
1.0,"Well for the money I guess you can’t complain, but’s it cheap looking, and I wish I didn’t buy it. Poorly made."
1.0,Looks like curtains. I returned it.
1.0,I ordered for my grams her usual size is xxxl but it looked like it waz made for M size people
1.0,Cant believe you thought 500 grams of gold was 200$ in the first place
1.0,Order gray and they were not even close to a shade of gray. They were beige. Order up a half size and they fit like a whole size down. Sent them back.
1.0,"Loved the look of it, bit as soon as I got it and wore it, it didnt keep time. I returned it after 2 days."
1.0,"Broken upon arrival, one of the ribs wouldn’t extend out and lock in leaving a portion of the umbrella useless."
1.0,The vendor is not trust worthy. I bought a 6 pack and they start sending pair by pair with a difference of two weeks in between. After the second pair I ended returning the product ( it would end shipping at that pace 2 months later) and the quality looked bad.
1.0,"I got the XL so I could have a loose fit. It's a normal t-shirt with a zipper on the back. Given the fit, complete waste of $. Do NOT recommend."
1.0,"Do NOT order these! The seller should be embarrassed to be selling these pants! Not only are they a thin cheap material, they were dirty and had spots on them!!! Shame! I will be returning them!!!"
1.0,"I normally wear XL, saw size chart which indicated 2XL. Bought the 3XL just in case. Still does not fit."
1.0,Sweatshirt is thick but emblem is cheap and it takes 4-5 weeks for Delivery and they will keep changing the day of delivery.
1.0,They both broke when I tried to open the segment to put them in.
1.0,These earrings look nice in the picture but they are poorly made.  One of the earrings arrived broken.  Don't bother.
1.0,Lenses don’t stay down very well at all.
1.0,"I wore this sweater for not even an hour and it formed small balls.  Do not buy this product, it even read on the tag, &#34;do not wear for long periods of time.&#34;  Seriously how can a sweater form balls in an hour. Can't even imagine what it will look like after washing...."
1.0,Never had a chance to wear it. I purchased for holiday trip to Punta Cana and it ripped at seems immediately. Very sad as it was a pretty piece ans i had to purchase a replacementon vacay.
1.0,"Just received this today. At first I loves it.although it didn't look silver, it has a rustic look to it. I was ok with that. But before I put it on one of the beads fell off. Which I got over as we'll buy about 6hrs later the whole bottom portion underthe flower just broke off. Out of nowhere.<br />Horrible. Real disappointed."
1.0,Right now is black
1.0,the fabric feels like plastic and I will be returning it.
1.0,Gross smell and sowing of the product was done so poorly. Into the garbage it goes!
1.0,"Fabric was not great quality at all, and the way it fit was uncomfortable.  I didn’t even wear it.  Super disappointed and dissatisfied."
1.0,"Cheaply made, material is terrible. It pills after one wash. Not worth the price at all. Choose something different. Very disappointed."
1.0,"NOT 2 1/4&#34; WIDE!!! NOT A SLIM TIE! I ordered 6 for my wedding party. Shipping took forever and when they arrived, they were almost 3&#34; wide! Very disappointed."
1.0,Waaay toooo long!
1.0,Yo por lo normal visto size M y esta me quedo muy pequeña
1.0,Not like the picture at all.
1.0,It was too small in the waist and too long in the front. Requested a return the day after it was recieved and no reply was ever recieved.
1.0,False advertisement.  Description states sweatshirt but it does not come CLOSE to a sweatshirt.  Plus colors ae way off from what you see on the screen.  Done being disappointed with clothing on Amazon.
1.0,"The product itself looks like it’s pretty durable, but I ordered a smaller size because the first set I ordered was to big, and they sent me the exact same size. I ordered from another company."
1.0,Humongous unable to use. Already replaced
1.0,I was so excite about these bc they were so cute. I carry them in my scrub pockets and use at work. I noticed they didn't cut that well through kerlix/gauze then they just completely came apart into 2 pieces from hinge! I was so mad I paid for better quality with a pair from dollar store. Can't believe they fell apart after less than a month! I'm a nurse and actually needed these for work.
1.0,cheap quality string looks gold on image I was just a yellow rope nezuko muzzle looks nice in image in person its a thin foam faded in color stick just super bad quality especially for the price
1.0,Hate everything about the dress. It feels like I'm wearing a shower curtain. Not flattering at all. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time and money on this dress.
1.0,It wasn't what I expected. ..
1.0,Way too small. I read reviews and sized up and still too small
1.0,Product had strange seem across the midsection I didn't care for. The images don't show the seem. Uncomfortable to wear return to Amazon.
1.0,"A stone came out of this ring 2 days after I got it! It's pretty and fits well, but it's missing q stone."
1.0,These are not extra large. Large at best. Don't believe the measurements. Had to return.
1.0,Every time I bent over they slid down. I had to return.
1.0,Suit is like something from family dollar
1.0,"This product is highly misrepresented. They portray this as thick, fuzzy, cashmere material, available up to 4XL in size. I ordered the 4XL, expecting it to be a bit small and fit more like a 2XL (as is common for these products). What I received looks like cheap, polyester sweatpants. Not fuzzy or thick at all. The lining is polyester fleece, not anything like cashmere or wool at all. They MIGHT be warm, but I wouldn't know because they fit like a SMALL or at best a tight medium. There's no way this is a 4XL, unless it's a children's size. And on top of that, they are making me pay for return shipping. Do yourself a favor and avoid this seller. They are scammers."
1.0,Turns afrer a few weeks . Disappointing
1.0,"Was looking for a less expensive alternative to Columbia,  which I really like. This was not it. I have had them for a little over a week and worn them about 5 times. They were comfortable but I put them on this morning and one of the ankle straps broke at the seams. I have not contacted Amazon yet about a return but I will do that later today."
1.0,The body of the shirt was snug and the arms were way to baggy. It was the oddest fit ever. The material is very artificial feeling and not comfortable to wear. The color of the sweatshirt was very washed out and not representative of the picture they show. Horrible purchase.
1.0,Opened box estatic about the look of the earrings. Took the back off to put in my ear and all that stayed on my ear was the post! The whole setting fell off the post :( returned...
1.0,So ugly & looks nothing like the pic!
1.0,The dress was not as described in the description. And if you look closely two different kinds of dresses are used in the pictures. My mother in law bought the same dress but she got the one described in the ad. I returned ours.
1.0,Want the world to know what color your panties are this will do the trick.
1.0,"I was OK with this necklace, even though one of the names was printed in all caps and I did not order it that way but now the finish is badly tarnished! I left it in the box to wrap for Christmas and now I can't do anything with it! I've contacted the seller and will update if I get an answer. I would not recommend this purchase!!"
1.0,Piece of junk. Breaks easily
1.0,Did not fit the bust. Made for an A cup
1.0,"As other reviewers mentioned, it broke day one from mild play."
1.0,"Large is truly a large and the neckline is way too big.  Will have to give away, if anyone would wear it."
1.0,The chain broke in two places at the same time with no effort. 2nd time my wife wore it and it broke while she was putting it on.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:220b235d2e82a31e288afa8901f33fa5]] Very poor quality scrub hat, material made and style is just bad. Waste of money and time."
1.0,"Cheaply made, lots of dangling threads, way too small for listed size"
1.0,Literally terrible extra 6th rnd missing A-F running backs also had a duplicate page of running backs. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,Didn't even try it on. This plaid shirt is Ugly! Blue and red plaid and the solid red do not match. And the black on top instead of blue to match the plaid! Ugly!!!
1.0,Worst material ever.  These pants look and fit like a 5 year old made them.  Awful!!!
1.0,I'd give it zero stars if I could. Band broke 2nd day. My daughter was really bummed! I took it to a local jewelry shop to be repaired rather than mess with returning it. That cost an additional $20!!
1.0,Junk. Broke in one day
1.0,Earrings turned bronze after 1 month of wear.
1.0,"I wanted to purchase cloth masks which have filter pockets and nose wire.  This product has a long name which includes filter pocket in it, and also there is a graph illustration showing nose wire.  When I received a pack of them,  the masks have no filter pockets and no noise wire.  So be careful when you shop masks with these features.  The seller put misleading information there which is really no responsible."
1.0,Way Way to small! I dought it would fit a small child.Only positive is the print is cute.
1.0,Broke apart in pieces after one week of wear and the vendor would not honor a return.  very cheaply made.
1.0,Looks like a top not a dress! Do not buy
1.0,This product was misleading I ordered  2× it fit like an extra small.
1.0,This watch only lasted on day before one of the small hands fell off and jammed up the auto wind. Fifty dollars poorly spent.
1.0,"The queen size feels more like size B.  Very tight in the thighs.  Also, they are thin and run easily.  I bought a bulk of them (because I wear hose every day with a business suit/skirt to work) and only get one wear out of them most of the time."
1.0,Patch fell off.
1.0,Stopped working after 1 month. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,The picture is misleading. The ring is much much smaller and thinner.
1.0,Product is completely different from picture! Returned immediately after what i got wasnt even stringy lile the pic just a plain black bottom with a bandeau top
1.0,Will not stay on... like at all... get them on and the moment you touch them they fall off.  Also made with real cheap metal
1.0,I ordered this 2 sizes up & still didn't fit.
1.0,Runs very small - I had to cut it off.
1.0,"Walmart brand bra. Bought for twice the price because Walmart matrix was being redone and they didn't know if they'd be getting them back.<br /><br />Looked up the model of my bra, searched and this came back. The cut is not the same. The straps arent the way they attach are not the same."
1.0,Look nothing like the pandora  charm.
1.0,Color is not the same
1.0,This is the worst dress I've ever seen
1.0,"In the listing, it is written that the pants are supposed to be made from Cotton, but they are made from a synthetic fiber which is both unbreathable and uncomfortable to wear, more like a bathing suit then pants. The size was not right either, I ordered a 4XL American size and got an Asian 6XL which is a bit smaller. I am very unsatisfied at what I got and think that the listing is completely misleading."
1.0,I like them but they are very small no even for little girls I need to return cause of size
1.0,Material very low quality for price<br />Very uncomfortable  in the Carpentery industry
1.0,NO GOOD
1.0,Only gets one star cause it’s a pretty pink and soft.  But the usb cable is torn and it won’t warm up.  Not happy with it.  Only reason. I’m keeping it is due to it’s a pretty color that’s all
1.0,"DARN HAT WAS WAY TO BIG I PAID $48.00 FOR IT BUT TRYED TO SEND IT BUT EVERY PLACE WANTED $30.00 TO $35.00 TO SEND IT BACK SO I THINK IT'S SUCKS , WOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM"
1.0,Really cute but gem doesn't stay facing forward. It swings down and is unable to see.
1.0,Too big for a child’s face.  I can’t imagine what use this would be for an adult.
1.0,I am really upset although it's a great product and the stickers looked cute it says I'm ordering 144 pairs...what arrived was only a packed of 44 pairs of sticker earrings.
1.0,"Disappointed! It was just terrible, the fit, the material, I had to return the item, nothing like in the picture"
1.0,"Sure it’s sheer, but I did not get that from the pics.  It’s too big. It’s not as long as pictured, and the scoop is very much higher than the pic. It’s like a regular old tank top! The pic shows a super low scoop neck which was exactly why I purchased it.  Definitely returning."
1.0,"If you're expecting to ""get what you see"" in the picture, you're going to be utterly disappointed. It's fking Orange. It's bright orange and Grey and not that beautiful light soft brown/blonde you think it's going to be. They even changed the picture I see, too many disappointed reviews ey? So disappointed. And you know they get a fk ton of sales because THE PICTURE IS A LIE! It's false advertisement!!!"
1.0,"Waste of money, very small in size and thin like laytex."
1.0,Very tight Ann uncomfortable
1.0,Very cheap looking ended up getting it broken no reply from seller.  In the trash

1.0,"Primera vez que me lo pongo y se abrió el pantalón, muy mala me hizo pasar el oso."
1.0,There wasn't any tummy control and instead of having clean lines it was all rutched
1.0,Too small want a refund
1.0,Got a small and it fit on me like a large on top off having an extremely long crotch area
1.0,Wrong color and workmanship not very good.
1.0,Cool looking shoes but not comfortable at all.
1.0,The whole thing was just blah. Very big and loose (I ordered a small...looks like a large) and just not flattering at all. The elastic around the ankles is also way too tight. I set up a return right away.
1.0,"Completely see through,  thin and unwearable unless your sleeping. Scratchy material. Terrible"
1.0,"incredibly bad quality, very cheap. I opened the package only to find little flaws in the plastic looking leather here and there, but decided to use it anyway. Not even an hour later the keychain strap fell off. Looks good in pictures, but cheap in person."
1.0,"Terrible,disclosed,should not be sold to any one."
1.0,Pockets are arrived torn .The neck design was very ugly .The real product was nowhere close to the picture displayed here
1.0,didn't like them
1.0,"This shirt is not a women's size, but men's sizing, but it did not say that in the description when I bought it. Also, it is shiny and made of a polyester type material."
1.0,"It is too small, my head does not fit in it."
1.0,"Just like Kaylie got, a blackish grey top that doesn't look anything like the picture. Contacted the company and they said it only looks like that at night and that it's supposed to be dark grey. Well, it doesn't even look like that at night with lights on it. False advertising, DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,I do not really write reviews but on this one I had to chime in a bit. Just to be clear Amazon did give me a full refund for this product. But that is besides the point I just want to make customers aware that I bought these in June of 2021 and I am a month and 5 days after my purchase and all three have broken. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they make them better.
1.0,"The material ruins it, it looks like a cheap Halloween costume."
1.0,The slits in these pants were on the sides instead of that front. Really not acceptable.
1.0,Too big for hat.  Threw it away
1.0,It was ok just too big<br />Won’t buy from this person afain
1.0,Fits tight ladies! I went up an extra size and it still fits snug
1.0,"This dress is absolutely awful!!! There hem was several different lengths. There was a seam half way down the skirt and all the way around. There was another seam down the middle front of the skirt. And although there is a lining, the materials are sheer and  it’s all see through."
1.0,Already has a hole ripped in it near the pocket.
1.0,Necklace arrived with pearls coming off . Not what I expected.
1.0,I think these would have been cute had they both not come broke.
1.0,did not impress me
1.0,"Socks stretched out after a half dozen washes and wears. Will not stay in place, rolls down and has to be pulled up often. I will dispose of these socks. Gave them one star for the cute print."
1.0,I wanted NY Giants (NFL)
1.0,"I bought two. One for my daughter and one for myself. I didn’t like the material. It hung like a tent. It made my body look like a huge marshmallow. My daughter’s was a smaller size. I tried it on, but the smaller size didn’t change the way it hung like a tent.  I would not recommend this sweater."
1.0,I went by the size chart and I could not even get the skirt past my thighs. I will be returning this skirt. I only gave 1 star because it would not allow me to give 0
1.0,They look nice but feel like you're wearing two cardboard boxes on your feet. Actually two cardboard boxes might feel better.
1.0,Arrived in three pieces (should have been one). Unusable trash. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"I ordered this for my daughter in the usual size I get for her but this jumpsuit is way too big.  It is adult size, not girls size.  The material  is also rough and not so appealing."
1.0,I was VERY disappointed with this purchase. It didn't even come with a clip for the rest of the wig and it was very tight and I have a big head so I couldn't even get it on. Not a good purchase. Sorry.
1.0,Horrible quality. The zipper broken within 3 weeks after purchase.
1.0,"The size chart made a 2X seem like the right fit. Ummm, no. I would say my 2X suit maybe was about a size 12 U.S. size.  So size up, ladies! The material quality and style was cute. I gave it to a friend's daughter."
1.0,Top was too small. Bottoms fit as expected. Don't care for the wide elastic waist.
1.0,Horrible!!! Would not recommend to anyone.
1.0,Used it once for only a few hours and the zipper broke. The bag was nowhere near stuffed to full capacity and I wasn't rough on it at all. Cheaply made. Not happy with my purchase.
1.0,This is a VERY BORING PIECE..I'll stick to the department store sales. ..this is cheap IN EVERY WAY..
1.0,Horrible. Don’t purchase.
1.0,Kids loved it but it will quickly wear down. After a week the threading/stitching started to come loose and they both have limp unicorn horns. They still wear it to keep their ears warm and love how comfortable it is but it looks trashy now.
1.0,Runs very small I am 5 4 145 usually get a large but was afraid it ran small.  It was like a child’s bathing suit awful returned.  I guess if u r small and order a large it might fit.
1.0,Bought my normal size and it was super tight and snug on my arms and upper area. Also super sheer and did not have a liner like it said it did.
1.0,"I liked the look of the shirt and the feel of the material … until I put the shirt on and realized the collar is huge and stretched out.  Consequently, the shirt has been relegated to  something I throw on around the house when I have nothing else to wear.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"I'm 5'11"" and weight between 170-180 lbs and I ordered a large size but I was barely able to fit in the shirt. So maybe going up 2 to 3 sizes but I rather not deal with that and confuse myself with what size shirt I really wear."
1.0,These slippers are super cheap. They flattened out on first wear under not much weight
1.0,"The white bra comes with black removable cups. Who thought this was a good idea? As soon as you put it on, they are very noticeable. If you wear with a shirt over, no problem, but then to do laundry you’re separating the black cups out to do a load of whites. I got this to wear under white workout shirts, and it’s useless now. And it’s way too see-through to wear without the cups. So disappointed."
1.0,Dont waste your money! They are way to short & ride up.
1.0,"I LOVED this ring as it was a promise ring from my boyfriend. However, my diamond fell out after just a week of wearing it. I made sure to take it off while getting in the shower, washing my hands etc. I’m so heart broken."
1.0,"Dress came in wrong size, the zipper wouldn't work"
1.0,The sound was staticy and cut in and out a lot on three different devices. Rather disappointed.
1.0,I DONT LIKE THIS COAT! IT IS VERY THIN AND THIS IS NOT A WINTER COAT. IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP AND HOME MADE. NOT WELL PUT TOGETHER.  IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!!! IM GETTING A REFUND! THE PICTURES ARE FRAUDULENT! THIS IS NOT THE SAME COAT THAT THE MAN HAS ON IN THE PICTURE! DON'T BR FOOLED. THE COMPANY HAS NOW OFFERED ME 30 DOLLARS TO TAKE MY REVIEW DOWN! AND IM NOT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS IS FRAUDULENT! BAD FOR BUSINESS! AND LIEING ABOUT A PRODUCT TO MAKE MONEY SHOULD BE ILLEGAL!!! SMH !! WOW !
1.0,"Although the shorts were decent looking,  they were very unflattering. They were tight in all the wrong places and they have a shiny finish or coating. however you want to describe it. But it wasn't what i was looking for. I returned them"
1.0,"Ring was too small, and ring was much much darker than the image. Not worth the money, pass it up."
1.0,Poorly made and does not fit
1.0,Cheaply made low quality!
1.0,It's durability lasts 2 weeks
1.0,"doesn't cover the breasts, not even half. uncomfortable and small. regretted purchasing immediately"
1.0,It's a no no for me
1.0,"Very poorly made,  do not waste your money"
1.0,"Updated review: Wrote this review weeks ago and never heard from this company to make this right. Bracelet was worn ONCE and charms fell off. LUIANAN NEEDS TO REPLACE THIS DEFECTIVE ITEM.<br /><br />Original review: Gave as gift. First time worn, charms fell off and were lost. Very, very disappointed with the extremely low quality of this item. Would like to leave this review with zero stars."
1.0,"I love the design, however the fit is terrible.  It says to order true to size, I wear an XL.  The first shirt I ordered was an XL and it fit like a tight large.  So I ordered an XXL thinking it would fit...the XXL I ordered fits like a regular large....very disappointed because the design is fantastic!!  Sending both back 😢"
1.0,I won't be wearing these...
1.0,It had a strong smell. I bought large and was still small to wrap around. So I have to donate :-(
1.0,"My wrists aren't large, but the band on this tiny watch was for a child or a very small person.  I couldn't wear it.  It was much shorter than the Casio that I was replacing due to a cracked watch band."
1.0,"I bought 2 of these (different versions) for each my sons for Christmas. My son that was wearing his more frequently, well it completely fell apart after about 2 weeks. Very disappointing 😕"
1.0,Bought this as a cheap water source for military and filled it up once and leaked immediately. I threw it away directly after. Very disappointed and left me without a water source in 100+ degree weather for a month.
1.0,very small & very thin.
1.0,WAY too small for anyone's head except a 1 year old. I have a small head and no way would it fit.
1.0,Frumpy. I'm a L but I ordered a M and it was the correct size for this dress. Just the shape was off. It was just way too frumpy. Like a moo moo dress. And very dull. Not vibrant like the model's dress. Mine looked like it was washed about 100 times then sent to me. I quickly returned it at my nearest Amazon return location.
1.0,"Received package, ocean box was ripped completely on the right, and the Dolphin sleeve and bracelet was missing from the collection<br />Got to send it back"
1.0,"this sweater it is made to small and it is a one size fits all, I would like my money back and to return the sweater but you closed the window of opportunity for me to return it almost when I got it, so I couldn't get my money back, I don't know what is going on, I have tried to exchange items but haven't been able to because they were made to small, this looks like a one size fits all but it is small, I really liked it to,"
1.0,"Don’t buy this thing it’s not worth it at all, I doesn’t do anything at all, like literally nothing."
1.0,band can't be adjusted.
1.0,Not TTS.
1.0,The dimensions of this bag stated it was 3  inches deep. Not possible because it is closed at the bottom with a single seam. It will not hold the things I need to put in it so I'm still shopping for the right bag. Very disappointed.
1.0,I think the ideal thing would be to try to wear this dress in small if you have DD breasts and are taller than 5ft.  I thought it would fit my kid and she's 5'1' and it's like a large bag on her.  it's too long and the orange part ends at below her waist which makes her look like she's a doll not a human being.  sad.
1.0,This vest did not heat up properly.
1.0,"This is absolutely not alpaca wool.  It's a synthetic - it isn't warm like wool, the fibers are glossy, and they melt like plastic when you apply a flame.  Wool, including alpaca wool, does not do this, only synthetic fibers do."
1.0,"Ordered the 16” and what came was a generous 15.25”. In a longer chain it might not be a problem but I regularly wear 16” and the loss of the .75 inch makes it way too tight, almost choking. Will be returning. It looks like a nice chain. Pity I can’t wear it."
1.0,CLEARLY NOT A HALF INCH!! I’m not sure who measured these out..... but they are much smaller than a half inch.... which is disappointing considering this is the second time this has happened..... I know I should have gone to my jeweler but I figured I’d give it a try. Never mind.
1.0,These DO NOT offer ANY protection!
1.0,The white shirt was very see-through!
1.0,Polarization is very weak. Not only that but the lenses are not tough at all. Took less than a month to lose the reflection. I am constantly on the water so if there are any fisherman who are considering buying these I would strongly recommend otherwise.
1.0,Case did not fit phone.<br />Now I can not find the return icon to return the item.
1.0,The first time I wore these they kept falling out. The second time I wore them the stem part of the closure broke. Seriously?
1.0,Way to large. Looks like a garbage bag on.  No shape. Returned
1.0,Cheap & the bunched sleeves look like a sewing accident. Better options out there.
1.0,"Ultra cheap, I've seen some for around this price that look great. This was NOT it. A few stones feel out first night it was worn."
1.0,Size is not defined on the website.  It is represented by photos next to bigger earrings.  Small enough for a newborn.
1.0,If HQ lips are 7” long…. I bought for a costume and they look ridiculous.
1.0,Too small. Poor quality<br /> Came from china so shipping took awhile too.
1.0,The price was good. I didn't realize it could scratch my watch. It's plastic the part touching the watch. That's my only complaint.
1.0,Defective!!! I give this product no stars. There is no zipper on the romper so there is no way to put the thing on. The neck hole is too small for even the smallest person to slide in and there are straps there anyway. Complete Crap.
1.0,Cheap and doesn’t look like the picture shown!
1.0,"I like how these fit, they are stretchy and cover your entire behind and don’t ride up at all. The reason for the bad review is actually the fabric.. the fabric doesn’t absorb any moisture at all, no breath ability, which causes some irritation on my skin around the sides of my underwear and a general sense of uncleanliness. I’ve tried wearing this brand for months and can’t seem to solve this issue. Don’t recommend for that reason. Strange fabric"
1.0,Adorable little charm that fell off and got lost within the first day of wearing the hoop because it wasn’t attached to the hoop in any way.
1.0,"Terrible product, a big hole .<br />Looks like someone used it.<br />I want my money back."
1.0,"I washed it on gentle cycle and a thread on the shoulder came loose and the whole sleeve ripped off. I got a good one wear out of this. Looks nice, but made cheaply."
1.0,it broke before I could wear it
1.0,Don't waste your time
1.0,Missing several pieces and several ball/spike ends. Not worth the $$$. Send another set for free and I'll feel better about it. These are gifts for piercing enthusiasts..... I'd be embarrassed to give them less than I paid for and with missing pieces too.....👎
1.0,They are huge!!!
1.0,I usually do not review items on Amazon good or bad but this Necklace was a huge disappointment. I knew that since the cost of it was so cheap the quality wasn't going to be top quality but the chain had like a kink in it and since the chain was very fragile and thin when I tried to un-kink it the chain broke. The Cross was pretty thin as well. Be careful because it will bend. You do get what you paid for for sure.
1.0,The product is nice but so much overpriced
1.0,The sweater is not a natural off the shoulder big sweater. It’s just a normal sweater. This item is not  nice and soft sweater material. I usually wear a size large and I purchased it in a 2X… and it still fit like a box cut top.<br />.
1.0,I ordered a men's jacket for my boyfriend and it is not ! It zips and fits like a women's jacket so we returned it!! Disappointed because he really needs it as he is a t ruck driver driving in the snow and very cold temps!
1.0,FAKE!!!  GLASS!!!  NOT REAL!!!!!!  TOO SMALL!!!  Received  BROKEN !FAKE CLASS!
1.0,The top had two big holes in the front. Very disappointed!
1.0,Finally received it after 1 month.  It runs small not true to size.  The picture is not what the sweater looks like at all.  Very thin and the buttons fell off already.  Not a good purchase.
1.0,Doesn't work. Do not waste your time.
1.0,cheap material....its tooo small....and I ordered blue but they delivered black one....dissapointed...
1.0,"This outfit is cheap and poorly made.  I'm not surprised. I knew that would probably be the case based on the brand and price.  I'm usually a Medium and sometimes a Large.  The Large was too small.  I would only recommend this outfit for someone who is in their teens or 20s and very slim.  Otherwise, save your money and purchase a romper maxi that cost a little more and of better quality."
1.0,"It's outside return date, so I guess I am stuck with it. It ripped at the wrist seam. Also, wrinkles badly after washing. I do not recommend."
1.0,Had ugly material
1.0,Very junky.. cuts your hand getting on or off
1.0,It was Terrible! material not as described super shiny looked nothing like the picture
1.0,It fell apart after the first wash
1.0,"Dress sizing chart wasn't like I thought, It is truly meant for small ladies ONLY."
1.0,"Cheap, tacky, not worth the cost. Also, the description doesn’t say anywhere (as of the date of my purchase) that the material is velvet."
1.0,"Not what I ordered this was second order in a week, not happy ,last year I ordered  but it was a different product and was good."
1.0,BEWARE!!! These are HORRIBLE!!! The quality is so so so bad. Shedding everywhere and looks SO cheap. I’m so bummed I put these on our wish list. Now I’m hsving issues returning them to get credit for something else. Shame on amazon for letting brands like this on their site. I’m teally starting to jot trust anything but the name brands. Super disappointed.
1.0,Omg never again. I’m a very curvaceous female and this dress did not do me justice at all‼️‼️‼️ I even ordered a size too small and it was still too large. I sent it back
1.0,"The crotch hangs super low.  I wish I would have sent them back but I wore them and washed them.  Now I hate them.  The dragon fit ones are a hundred times better.  These have sloppy stitching, also.  These pants are good for people who are not short waisted."
1.0,"Terrible!  Watch came not working and had NO instruction of any kind.  I had to replace the battery.  Supposedly links can be removed from the watch bracelet for fit but without any instructions.......  We've put the watch on the shelf and charged it all up to experience.  Again, Terrible."
1.0,The earrings are very boho and cute but they literally fell apart the first hour that  I wore them  The cowrie shells were attached by jump rings that did not close all the way and they kept slipping off.  I put them back on but them the chain that connects to the ear stud broke. Very poor quality.
1.0,I ordered this item because the add said 100 percent cotton. It’s not!!!!!  It says polyester on the tag. It’s going back. This isn’t the first time I’ve had this happen. I don’t think I’ll order anymore clothes from Amazon.
1.0,Product nothing like advertised. Came as a normal button up shirt.
1.0,No silver and received peeling silver paint. Unable to wear at all
1.0,This watch was much smaller and the watch band was thinner than I  anticipated. I  decided to  return it.
1.0,I ordered a hat last year from a different company and had no complaints.  This hat was a much poorer quality.
1.0,I didn’t like the sweater type material.
1.0,it doesnt even fit on body like picture 75% smaller than pic
1.0,I don't like them. They're too small.
1.0,Half the size they are described as. I don’t know if they don’t care about QC or if they simply don’t expect people to be able to check the size. Overall pretty disappointing. I’d recommend going with a different company.
1.0,Wasn't expecting it to be so thin. Not made to keep a person warm.
1.0,"Not as pictured ...keep getting blue on blue .  After 2 tries, gave up"
1.0,I bout an XL and it’s way too small. I’m between a B/C cup so I don’t need an XL size cup-I just don’t like them fitting tight around. I’m a little more broad shouldered. There’s zero stretch to these bras. They’re terrible. Way too tight. They suck the life out of me and create a nice big fat roll under bottom of bra. Hate them.
1.0,I have had my bag a few days over a month. The strap snapped.
1.0,"Had to return, smelt terrible with chemical. I kept it in the window to air out for nearly a week, the stink did not let up at all."
1.0,Colour is not as nice as in picture material cheap as well
1.0,Sleeves disproportionately long
1.0,THEY ARE TOO SMALL
1.0,"I bought these for a party and they were useless. They did not show up on the glass. Ended up having to buy some sharpie metallic ones that did the trick.<br />Of course, by the time I pulled these others out to use them, my return window expired. :(. Lesson learned - don't buy too early and wait to use them."
1.0,"Has flaws , color not as shown . Would return , if My shipping fee was reimbursed"
1.0,It is way to small on me. If I had a smaller chest I bet it would work a bit better. The strings are not like the photo shows and it's hard to figure out what goes where. I reccomened spending a bit more money on a more reliable product.
1.0,Sizing was too big and even after exchanging for a smaller size it didn't work for me. I thought it was supposed to be thick and cause your stomach to sweat (creating water weight loss) but it was really thin and didn't do anything.
1.0,I had this watch for only about a month before it broke. It is not worth the money.
1.0,It didn't fit right as if it stretched out of form once you put it on. Wasn't my favorite purchase.
1.0,"I've worn this twice, washed them every time, and the fabric is fading along all creases. Cheap and not worth the money."
1.0,No quick release latches
1.0,After a few washes the bottoms bends and folds up and does not keep the appearance good.  Waste of money.
1.0,Would not keep running/time correctly!
1.0,I hated the dress and even more the store!  They sent to me a defective dress and I had to spend almost 20 dollars to send it back and no one was very interested in helping me.  Horrible and unfair support!  I don’t recommend!
1.0,"Im very disappointed, we placed this order for delivery today to my Niece for her Birthday. I was notified last night that it was cancelled. No reason why. But now my niece has nothing for her birthday."
1.0,This bracelet broke within the first week of wearing it.  It was too big of a hassle to take it to the UPS store to return it.
1.0,Extremely cheap.
1.0,"Returned. Too small. Barely fits Apple 7 phone. Very unpleasant odor too. Had a floral scent packet in it for some reason. Stitching not attractive, couldn't warm up to color... more of a clay dirt brown."
1.0,I got a completely different pair of shoes than the one pictured. I was only offered a refund rather than an exchange for the correct product.
1.0,"For my phone is not quite large enough. For me oo tight to get the phone easily in and out of case. Build is great, just too tight!"
1.0,I bought three of these to match with my sisters and all 3 broke within three days of wearing them. The clasp also made the necklace itchy.
1.0,Not oversized at all!<br />Perfect for a child.
1.0,The band doesn’t stay locked on to the watch. It fell off and I lost my watch
1.0,Get what you pay for!  Disposable at best.
1.0,Disappointed. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"The product was not what I had expected, as soon as I put my money in the clip, the clip snapped into two pieces."
1.0,Image size on the shirt is alot smaller than expected. So disappointed in that. But it fits nicely.
1.0,Dosen't stiffen like all water came out out of the can...
1.0,The material is thin so you can see the panty line or any underwear lines. Very disappointed. Will return this.
1.0,Not a real onyx definitely not.
1.0,This is junk.  Can’t remove the banks without either undoing the loop or uncoupling from the watch itself which defeats the purpose of having a band that you can quickly take on and off.  Used it for about 3 days and went back to the rubber bank supplied by Fitbit.  These stay wet and are poor quality and design.  Not even worth returning but I’m writing this so no one else donates to these guys.  JUNK!
1.0,"Although this dress is very pretty, it is not true to size at all. Very small framed women will fit this dress but myself as a 14-16 an xl does not even come close to fitting."
1.0,"The picture is cute - okay, it's definitely bling, but it's cute.  In reality, it's too tacky to wear.  The colors are harsh; it's loud.  It was really inexpensive, so I figured it was worth a try, but it's not something I or anyone I know could wear."
1.0,Fit for a child.
1.0,It says 2 pairs... Received only one.
1.0,Super long on me. Passed my knees. Looks like a moo moo and ran super big. :(
1.0,Picture shows a slip through closer band and a regular watch band was delivered.  1 star - product was not advertised right. 👎🏻
1.0,They were way too big for my face and they kept falling off. They also were more black than tortoise shell and since I wanted tortoise shell that was disappointing as well. I returned them
1.0,I really didn't order a screen protector.. I type in Samsung Galaxy note 5 cases.... I'm very disappointed..
1.0,"This is hideous! The skirted part went almost to my knees. For reference, I’m 5’8”."
1.0,"Arrived a day late and what poor quality they are! They even had chocolate on the bottom when I took them out of the package.... How does that even happen? The stitching is really uneven on the sole so in a couple spots it's barely sewn together I know it won't take long before it pops a couple holes. Plus the insoles aren't sewn in, why arent they sewn in...? Cute print, wish they were better made."
1.0,It was not that great the seem in the edges ripped of
1.0,Did not fit the ear.
1.0,This was way too small.  I was very disappointed and had to give it away. Not enough time to return 😪 and get it too my mom for Christmas.  Never order it again 😒 or from this company
1.0,These are just tinted sunglasses do not recommend
1.0,Made a mess and tasted gross.
1.0,I was looking forward to receiving the mask. The print on the mask is so small it looks more like a wiggly line.
1.0,This is so terrible it's kind of funny in a way. I opened my package and burst out laughing for awhile so thank you for the laughs but on a serious note.. this is a ripoff. Too bad the negative ratings were NOT shown when I made this purchase or I never would have in the first place. Wow.
1.0,Surveys blow
1.0,I slide around the house in these things like I’m on ice! In the trash they went
1.0,not an attractive sandals looks like you wearing a tractor trailer in each foot and then too narrow
1.0,"I don't know what I was expecting but what I got wasn't it.  It's very very, very chintzy.  Not good quality and I hate the fabric they used to make them.  The plastic card slots are a milky white color, not clear and they're not good quality.  Spend a couple extra bucks and get something good!"
1.0,"I've ordered dozens of shirts on Amazon, this shirt was nothing like the photo!  It was waist length not below the hips as advertised in the photo.  I had to give it to my daughter who wears it as a night shirt because it's not fit for public viewing!  Disgusted!  I read all comments and reviews always before ordering and felt like this would be the right fit. Not so!!!"
1.0,I did not get this shirt pattern; I got an ugly version of tie die.  The sleeves are not to the elbow like the picture shows.  Very poorly made.  Foreign made so more trouble to mail back then it's worth.
1.0,At first thought band looked very good. 20 minutes later the watch feel off my wrist. Universal clips appeared to be fasten so placed watch back on. An hour later the clip released again. The added weight of metal band threw my watch to titled floor cracking the backside of my S2. Very disappointed :(
1.0,Was not aware that these ties were not standard width. Should be in the description.
1.0,This must be made for a child... the choker part is really a choker.  I couldn't breathe
1.0,Not Waterproof!!!!!
1.0,"I needed a red beanie for my newborn. After this arrived, I saw it was a one size fits all, (about half the length of my baby's body)and was even too big for my toddler. Only purchase for older children. It should not be sold for babies!"
1.0,"HORRIBLE. Ripped within 1 second of putting it on. Took too long to get here AND it’s see through. Very upset about this dress. I was hoping it was going to be as pictured, but don’t be fooled!"
1.0,"This dress is NOTHING like the image! The material, the look, the length… it’s terrible. The size is okay. If you are looking for something tasteful for a wedding or dressy event this is NOT the item for you!"
1.0,Dislike these very much. They are huge and look like marbles not simple pearls.
1.0,Poor quality didn’t fit. I am 5’4” weight 130 ordered a large fit more like a medium. The reviews gave glowing praise.
1.0,"I’m 5’4 and 130lbs and while I didn’t have any problems with the waist,bust,arms, or legs actually fitting into the costume it was super short. The end of costume (that should be at your ankles) was almost at my knees and it collar was pulling on my neck due to how short it was. The hood also didn’t go over your head very well due to how it was fitting. Immediately returned this item."
1.0,"It can’t without a feather after a long wait, cheap!"
1.0,Las tallas no son del tamaño adecuado pedí Xl y fue más grande que el xxl es in compeesible Las medidas no están de acuerdo a la tabla de tallas que presentan
1.0,Feet hurt after a few hours . Not the product i expected.
1.0,Terrible material.  Completely see through.
1.0,"UPDATED:  I changed my rating from a 3 to a 1.  Once I started altering the dress I realized the shiny fabric under the tulle ruffles are filthy.  I mean disgusting filthy... no idea what the substance is but looks like the fabric was run over in a dirt floor warehouse.  I've posted a new photo.  Unfortunately I had already made a snip and removed the broken hoop when I turned up the lighting and saw it so I cannot return.  Avoid this dress!<br />---------------------------------<br />I'm torn on the rating.  I'm disappointed with many features of the dress and listing, and yet I look back at what I paid and I should be thrilled.  It's a great value if you don't have super high quality expectations.  I think my perspective is just skewed because I ordered two dresses at the same time - the other dress was from Etsy and it was heirloom quality, but also cost more.  This one, in contrast, is not.  Several beads arrived loose and needed to be stitched back on.  The color is not royal blue, but rather navy.  It's still pretty, but I specifically wanted royal blue, and had already bought royal blue shoes.  I am sharing a photo of the royal blue shoes against the fabric of the dress for anyone interested in the blue color.  There are a few royal blue sequins at the top, but overall I would call the dress navy.  The listing says the dress is photographed with a petticoat underneath, and that they would include one for free.  What I didn't realize is that they sewed a hoop skirt into the lining of the dress.  The hoop was not latched, so to make it work, I will need to cut it open, attach the hoop together and stitch it back up.  I was planning to cut this to a perky knee length party dress for my little girl, but the attached hoop skirt lining makes that more challenging.  And yet, she's going to look fabulous and the price can't be beat.  As long as you are willing to put a little work into making the dress great, I'm sure you'll be happy with it for the price.  The fit was accurate relative to the size chart."
1.0,"After having these reading glasses for a couple of weeks I noticed that the lenses were inserted backwards at the factory. The convex part of the lens is facing inside. When I received these glasses I noticed that if I moved my eye left or right, that the image blurred a bit. Now I know why. This is a serious flaw in these glasses. Otherwise, the glasses and case would be okay. Both pairs of glasses were manufactured the same way. I tried to pop the lenses out so I could put them in correctly, but they will not come out. The manufacturer should compensate customers who bought these glasses with corrected pairs. I am sure I am not the only one to receive them in this condition. I included a picture so potential customers and the manufacturer could see the defect."
1.0,"I wore this twice and then went to was it and the strap ripped right in half, it was on the gentle delicate cycle, love the dress but poorly made or mine was super faulty. I bought it in February waiting for spring summer but now I have to try and fix it or buy again. Be super careful upon washing."
1.0,I’ve got the box.. but without sunglasses inside..
1.0,This product easily fell apart with only two wears (two days in a row) at a water park. I would not recommend these for anyone looking for a water shoe for kids.
1.0,"Arrived tarnished, had to return."
1.0,bracelet was thinner than what the picture showed.
1.0,watch the gauge but even after that if you get it in you cannot connect it without ripping your nose apart
1.0,Nothing I don’t like it I’m going to donate it to the homeless shelter
1.0,Not really worth it i have bigger hands but not huge snd these are super small i even broke one because i thought it could be bigger but nope
1.0,Extra large and has no shape to it😭
1.0,I would have saved myself $15 if I would have bought these Halloween pajama pants directly from Walmart!!! What a rip off!!
1.0,"Yes, it did come fast and it did come with a pair of free earrings. However, the actual product looks like something you could have gotten from a 25 cent machine. It does not look like sterling silver at all. The free gift is a nice thought? It was big blingy heart earrings, not something most people will just wear on a daily basis, or ever."
1.0,really sad with this watch. I love the way it looks and the style. However it stopped working after 2 days.
1.0,"The ""red"" is too pink. There's no Pink Lantern Corps. The color needs to be stronger."
1.0,Returning...much smaller then pictured
1.0,"The bracelet and chain didn't match, I assumed it was a set"
1.0,"Not worth the money. Small, handles sewn oddly and noisy fabric."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f1e1cf99fca5458eb0608c453dd3f063]] Brim will never be flat as pictured.  They probably need to sell an iron to go with this hat. Also, the color is way more yellow than the picture indicates.  It truly feels like you bought this in the back alley of a Chinese bazaar"
1.0,Complete crap compared to soffe and more expensive. Just don't fit. Too tight around the legs.
1.0,"It looks totally different, fabric, color and style are not what's shown in the picture."
1.0,Arms are snug and torso short
1.0,They are not hemmed  on either end.  The fabric curls as you put it on. I had difficulty  straightening it out to cover my neck or face.  Fabric did not feel good against my skin. Fabric print muted  and not pleasing to the eye.
1.0,I loved this umbrella at first and the ability to keep the wetness on the inside of the umbrella but after 6 months and only having used it a handful of times at best - it will not stay up (the click at the top won't stabilize) and was a liability in a tough storm during my son's soccer game this week.  I don't know if my one umbrella was deceptive or if it is a quality flaw in general.  I would love to give it a second chance if the vendor would like to send me a free replacement.
1.0,Sits high off the skin and is heavy
1.0,"It was a nice shirt.  Had to return it, was too small."
1.0,Sloppy screen print. Lines on logo bled when they laid the logo. Bought XL fits like a Medium and now I ha e to pay for return shipping. Seem be be paying more shipping returns even though a prime member. Might be time to drop it.
1.0,I literally wore it once for a few hours and it turned a different color.
1.0,small size is way to big for my wife who uses small size.
1.0,Mine had a silver heart instead of a black one:(
1.0,I ordered the solid black one. It was beyond terrible! It is completely see through(super cheap fabric). I returned it immediately. Didn't even try it on.
1.0,"Big fail..  not distressed and not worth the money. Who do they think they're kidding selling false advertising?! Waisted time, packaging and fossil fuels."
1.0,We received the wrong dress 😬
1.0,"The material is like a cheap latex. Its uncomfortable and HOT asf. 0/10, dont buy."
1.0,Ripped fast
1.0,I originally loved this piece...a bit small for the chain but still loved....havent had it long at all and the colors of the metals are changing. I know have a two toned chain....disappointed.
1.0,"One picture is a bamboo no show sock from a previous company, and the other is the Felina I received today. I was a little worried because the bamboo content is lower than most true bamboo socks. I didn't realize they completely misunderstood the definition of low cut and no show! I wear a 6.5 to 7 in women's shoe..U.S sizing. This is the smaller size and still large, plus the wrong cut. Gave em away and ordered again from a new vendor. If you are looking for ankle socks and above a size eight, these are useful. Definitely not what I expected or needed. Buyer beware!"
1.0,These were incredibly cheap.  Low quality.  Horrible looking. I was afraid I was going to. Break them the first time I touched them.<br /><br />I have a big head and these were quite small too.<br /><br />These are made basically with thin wire frames
1.0,"The gloves size is very small, I have normal size hands. And it fits too tight for me. if you have really small hands it may fit you."
1.0,So disappointed in these rings
1.0,"As someone else stated, it smashed your eye lids and you can barely even see through it. Going to be returning these."
1.0,The pieces that fit into the wings had come unglued. Disappointed in product.
1.0,broquen
1.0,This is not for my girls who are well endowed in the chest area. It will not cover anything and it’ll make you feel a lot bigger then you are. I ordered a size up and it was still WAY to smaller
1.0,Cut to small
1.0,La calidad es buena pero la size no corresponde xxl. Es como un L pero así y todo cortísimos
1.0,"Unflattering, not true to size, fits small, a little too cheeky for me."
1.0,Didnt like the material in person.
1.0,"Received this and, while I wasn't expecting anything amazing due to the price, I also wasn't expecting there to be a bug ( or glob of God knows what) inside the necklace(see attached pic). Other than that, it would be pretty. But I won't be wearing it."
1.0,Looks and fits more like a girls shirt than a mans shirt
1.0,Awkwardly small on the butt.
1.0,"because after 2 weeks the sterling silver came off and it turned brassy,  very disappointed.. which means it was not sterling silver and you lied and scammed me."
1.0,I didn't like getting one.. when I need 2
1.0,"Heavy, battery dead in just a few weeks."
1.0,Shows the key rings with jump rings but none were included. They are useless with out the Hun rings
1.0,If I could give it a zero I would! 😒 so disappointed!! Took 2 months to arrive then broke less then a week of being worn!! A total waste!
1.0,Earrings returned. Very large posts. Extremely uncomfortable.
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. Feels rough like rather than soft. It has a patch of carpet sowed to the sleeve for no damn reason. Who made this shirt? I'll use it to wash my truck.
1.0,They broke immediately when i have used
1.0,Had I realized this sooner I would not have purchased.<br />So now I have 2 to throw in a box and never use.<br />I also have to look for another brand that opens on both sides like a normal insert.<br />This has to be cheap crap from China.  they say made in USA but I doubt it.
1.0,the item does not fit plus you have to pay $7 to return the item
1.0,Save your money. The adhesive isn’t sticky at all. I used every piece in this pack and not a single one would stick to my clean skin.
1.0,The ankle collars are nothing like the picture there extremely loose and don’t go all the way down
1.0,Hat came with tag cut in half
1.0,The trim along the edge does not lay flat. It rolls up all the way around the front
1.0,there was no way to clasp it shut so it cannot be worn
1.0,Definitely not what you see on the picture .
1.0,I was so disappointed!<br />The charms were all small to tiny. And very thin. Cheaply made.
1.0,This was not worth the price. Low quality.  I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift. Its much smaller than the photo. It really looks cheap. Its not sterling or even sterling silver plated.
1.0,"Pésimo, me lo imaginé mucho más bonito, No se parece a la caída que tiene en la foto.. es completamente de licra y transparente... mi escala de valoración del 1 al 10.. un 1!"
1.0,"I bought these slippers for something warm and comfortable to wear around the house. I received these yesterday within 30 minutes of wearing the slippers, one fell completely apart.  I died laughing how cheap these slippers are I do not recommend these to anyone"
1.0,Cute but it broke putting it on. Waste of money
1.0,"I typically wear a large in my shirts. The inner label is ""L"". This is absolutely not a large. Not even a size up will fit. This definitely more a shirt for women or teens. Will not fit an adult man."
1.0,Too bulky.
1.0,"I was really excited for these and thought the price made this too good to be true, well it is! Earrings arrived broken and frayed. I’m considering ordering again to see if maybe I just had bad luck but I am reluctant to risk it again."
1.0,Paint started to peel off after a month; did not work as advertised; not recommended!
1.0,My item came broken in half with a lot of scuffs and scratches on the back.
1.0,"The locket keeps falling off the chain, very unhappy with this! I managed to put the locket directly on the chain. Then the back of the chain completely broke. All this happened on the day I got it. Cheaply made."
1.0,Straps useless and top doesnt fit well for a bathing suit.was rather expensive would never purchase from them again.
1.0,Product took over a month to arrive and arrived damaged / defective. Visor glue had already fallen apart.
1.0,Faded and shrunk after 1st wear.
1.0,Disappointd the mask are yellowish not white.
1.0,I forgot I ordered the romper because it took so long to arrive however the material is very cheap and it runs very small!! Very disappointed!!
1.0,"poor quality, not nice enough for $$$"
1.0,"First of all, there is no way this fits 90+% of men (its too small); I have a small wrist, and it doesn't even fit me. Second, its cheaply made and rather junky even for the price. Third, and the kicker: they won't take it back.  Avoid it, its junk."
1.0,This 'waist trainer' is horribly and cheaply made. It feels like a giant sports bandage and offers no support or shaping  whatsoever. The sizing chart is way off as well....I'm a medium...that's what I ordered and it fits like an small. So disappointed.
1.0,To to small I ordered a womans 3X got child's size 6.
1.0,"I liked the color of this shirt and that’s it. It’s too short, too wide, cheaply made, and, looks cheap."
1.0,"I realize this was very, very inexpensive. With that said, I will tell you I opened the plastic bag they came in and 3 of the bracelets were broken."
1.0,I bought for a wedding.  The ones I wanted to wear broke the first time I tried to wear them.  The other pair had a jewel broken off the tip.  Bummer. Super sparkly.
1.0,IT WAS NOT BRIGHT LIKE THE PICTURES. IM PISSED
1.0,"Two months of light to moderate use and these clamps will not even stay locked down!  Require little to no pressure to close them, so they are not tight and will not stay closed.  No way to adjust the tension, so they are useless!  I would not buy this brand again!"
1.0,"They sent me the wrong color, plus this dress has no give, it runs small, it smashs your breast down and the arms are extremely tight😒😒"
1.0,a waste of money.  the first time i wore them the clip that adjusts the length broke.
1.0,One of the zippers keeps getting stuck and I can’t open it. I need a replacement please in red.
1.0,Very disappointed it was faded already when I received and it looks very cheap.
1.0,"This was a cute shirt but after the first wash in cold water, and hang drying, the decal stuck to itself and I wasn’t able to salvage the shirt. I am very disappointed."
1.0,Buttons aren’t as strong they kept unbuttoning.
1.0,horrible cheap badly made bikini...
1.0,this is cute however i constantly have to hunt for one of the pins that keeps falling out to replace it and the finish is wearing off.
1.0,These squeeze your nose so tightly that they pop off if you bend your head forward - - to READ!<br />I'll spend the extra $$ on Thinoptics next time.
1.0,Not for busty girls. Nipples pop out. Very small top.
1.0,"Right out of the bags, the handles were falling apart at the seems.  Love the look and the size, but the handles are sure to break quickly, unfortunately.  Would be a perfect beach bag of large towels, etc.  Even comes with a cute smaller zippered pouch on the inside (although no inside pockets)."
1.0,it looks like gross yellow spandex and is waaaay too long. I wanted to wear it as a tank top not a minidress.
1.0,They are WAY too small. I can't hardly even get my hands in these slippers. Many of my friends with much smaller feet than mine also said they felt too small.
1.0,These are not cut to flatter the curvy butt of a petite woman
1.0,Poor product. Not at all as described. Don’t waist your money! In the process of returning and that’s a hassle! RUN AWAY! Uhhhh so frustrating!
1.0,"I ordered 4 and the first one I opened broke. The second one I opened was really, really hard to wind back into the case. I think I will stick to fold up bags. Made in China"
1.0,I don’t really like the quality of the material.
1.0,Defective! One side is lower than the other
1.0,"These are a great material and seemingly well made. I used the size chart to get the best size to order, however, it was way off! The set I got for my husband is too small for my 13 year old! I will gift these to my lil nephew and donate the other sets since I got these at a huge discount. But buyer beware! 5x is a US Medium! I do not recommend these due to inaccurate sizing! If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up!"
1.0,"The product is not made of ""premium fabric"" as described. I am actually suspicious because the seller did not want to reveal the material such as cotton or polyester. Polyester underwear, which is synthetic material, will be always cheaper than cotton and it is just not comfortable to wear.<br /><br />One thing that puzzled me is the slogan in capital letters ""NOT ASIAN MANUFACTURED"". I hope the seller does not convey that the quality of Asian-manufactured underwear is inferior. I have purchased Uniqlo underwear in the past and I am happy with the quality. They are not cheap. They are made in Japan."
1.0,It was broken on delivery.  The stones had fallen out.
1.0,"The first time I used it, the strap came loose."
1.0,I bought many skirts from you and this one was too small and holes in dress. Very disappointed
1.0,Loose stretchy material and sequins falling out
1.0,"Very cheap, cant wear a strapless bra. not cotton, spandex."
1.0,Gave away. Didn't like. Nothing thrilled me about this.
1.0,"The shirt looked nothing like the picture, the quality of the shirt was stiff and the wording on the shirt was massive, and I ordered a small and it looked like they sent me a large shirt, and it was not the same color as in the picture, very disappointed, will not be buying from this company again."
1.0,Ordered a 2xl received a large
1.0,Buenos días aún no he recibido el pedido . Dice que se entregó en estatus pero aún sigo a la espera . Agradezco su colaboración en darme el estatus de mi pedido.<br /><br />Gracias
1.0,Awful.  Looks like a bed sheet or a curtain.
1.0,Do not buy.
1.0,"way too small, very disappointed"
1.0,This is made of cheap horrible material.  It looks nothing like the picture.  It is a faded burlap like material.  I can't believe they would sell this for more than $2.00
1.0,"I was so disappointed when I received this. I opened the umbrella - but it won't open all the way and stay open. It is too tightly strung so it doesn't go over the catch.  It also reeks strongly of some chemical, varnish type smell. I have to return it because it's useless if it won't open completely, isn't it? Aesthetically, the top is pretty ugly, too. see photos"
1.0,"I got these in the black marl color and although they fit really well, they are extremely see through!! I would definitely not be able to wear these out anywhere. Waste of money."
1.0,gold is already peeling off and clips slide off
1.0,I usually wear a large but ordered an Extra large and still can't get in it. The material is extremely thin.
1.0,It barely even fit on my pinky..  I'm 5.2 140lbs so I know I'm a size 7 ring size..  This is more a size. 4-5
1.0,These earrings were so cheaply made that they bent as I was opening the ear piece. The one that did not bend was off-center and sat at an angle in my ear. Do not buy.
1.0,To small ordered bigger size still to small
1.0,This did not work at all. I wish I could return it but I was so busy I let the time to return it slip bye.  I regret this purchesse.  I can't imagine it working at all for anyone unless you don't move AT ALL for work.
1.0,I ordered the size i usually order and it came wayy to small.
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy, not even worth the $8 I paid.<br /><br />The card slots are too small and unfinished so it rips way too easy. Not practical for &#34;real life&#34; use.<br /><br />I used it for maybe 24 hours before going and buying another one."
1.0,"Yes, it was inexpensive and looked better in the pictures than in person! It is polyester/blend and not what it looks like on the model in pictures, don't waste your time or $"
1.0,One pocket is almost sewn shut. Very tight. Very light weight . disappointing
1.0,Don't waste your money or time!  Horrible purchase.  I can believe this company is false advertising.
1.0,Does not come in box as pictured - picture is misleading
1.0,"Cheap! Huge! Elastic is running through waist and not attached. This is large size. Weight 187. 5’6. I pullled pants up almost over my boobs! U would have to have a giant hip area to fill out. If you hips and butt are 3-4 sizes bigger than ur top this could work. The top runs correct to size. At this rate on me I would have to wear small pants and large top so it’s going back. The material is super thin polyester with some<br />High waist smootint underwear it would work. Also, I am 5’6 and this would be floor length for ladies 5’9 so if ur hippy and thick and tall this would work for you!!!!!!"
1.0,"Only reason I bought this purse was because it looked like it had two pockets on the flap. One on the front and one on the actual flap like the other one I bought had, but it doesn’t. Tempted to return"
1.0,The pockets fell apart after the 3 time I used it.
1.0,Extremely small in hip areas
1.0,"Horrible quality and extremely overpriced. The top and apron are so stiff it is ridiculous. The dress material is very heavy like jean material and stiff. The seams don’t line up at all. I’m shock at the price and horrible quality. I’m even more shocked by positive reviews. I am returning the several I purchased. Lastly, if you really what to waste your money make sure you size up 1-2 sizes."
1.0,My daughter loved it but the necklace broke not long after I gave it to her.
1.0,Poorly sewn. There was a hole in it because the stitching never actually connected with the other side of the fabric. You can tell you looking that it wasn't quality checked.
1.0,"These gloves are not the size indicated in the description or pictures. The photos clearly measure the gloves at 23cm from wrist to middle finger tip, but they are 20cm at most. These are for women with relatively small hands. They also had a strong musty odor when they arrived, which did not air out. I cannot recommend these gloves for any reason."
1.0,The shoe has broken other than that it was great
1.0,Didn’t like the fabric nor the fit.  Tried to return within a week of receiving it and they only offered a portion of the price back.  Don’t buy from this company.
1.0,cheap &#34;gold&#34; color
1.0,Expected more than a hair thin chain
1.0,"After 1st wash (inside out, gentle cycle, air dry) the tulle ""ice cream"" came off. It has never been worn. I just got it last week. I basically wasted my money here."
1.0,"Unfortunately, the chain/bar portion is strung incorrectly so it looks twisted and doesn't lie flat.  Too bad, I liked it but will be returning as it is flawed."
1.0,If I could give this zero stars I would. What you receive is not what's depicted in their picture. Save your money.
1.0,Very cheap material... Feels like a hard  Pillowcase
1.0,Smells so badly of polyurethane and some other noxious mix that I got a headache and it smelled up my office.  I really don't want a leather wallet but I'll never risk this again.
1.0,The split in the shirt opens just below the chest. It is super awkward looking not at all how the pic shows
1.0,This watch was huge way to big for a young teenager
1.0,"I wanted these so much and loved them. BUT I wore them 2 days in a row and the back is falling off! The clip wasn’t very tight to begin with, but never expected it to fall completely off!"
1.0,The waist trainer is short. The material I nice and had it been a little longer I would like it but it doesn't sit very well on me so now I have no purpose for it. I have another one from this company that I like very well. It has adjustable straps so I have no problems wearing that one.
1.0,Size is incredibly off
1.0,Started peeling after 2 weeks.
1.0,runs about a size smaller
1.0,"I love the actual pendant, as I have a rescue Jack Russell mixed with who knows what, and it's very, very hard to find. anything that resembles him. The pendant feels, looks and appears to be well made, so I have no problem with the actual pendant. The chain that came with it, however, I have a HUGE complaint about it: it broke one the very first day I wore it!! I was just standing in a check out line and suddenly I felt something cold slide down my chest and land (sorry) in my bra!! It was my new necklace and the chain was broken right in the middle, nowhere near the clasp. There is no way to repair it and the bale is too small for me to put on any of my other necklaces.So now, I have this adorable unwearable pendant laying in my jewelry box. So, is there any way Amazon can replace just the chain?"
1.0,Rip very easily.
1.0,Hat delivered was NOT the hat pictured!  It was one of those stupid “urban” styles with the Front Porch brim ?!?!!<br /><br />Thoroughly disappointed in all ways!
1.0,Bought these shorts for my son and they ripped at the seem on the first day of him wearing them. I sized up and he had to wear a belt so it was the quality not size problem.
1.0,Runs small. Couldn't use it at all. Had to give it away.
1.0,"I bought these to wear in my apartment.  They are noisy (squishy sounding) and slippery, very dangerous.  Also, the bottom where the attachment is hurt's my feet. I am a 7 1/2 and they fit true to size, but narrow."
1.0,Arrived stained and dirty! Gross gross gross
1.0,These ran way to small
1.0,I used the sizing guide and even ordered a few sizes up because I could tell that this was shipping from china... still litterally nothing fit. The quality is also exceptionally poor.
1.0,bad fit and quality
1.0,I am pretty busty. 5’5” 175 and 38DD. It did NOT fit in the chest at all. It was way too small and didn’t even seem try to cover my side boob. I bought a large. It fit in the waist just fine so I don’t feel like sizing up would work.<br />The material is cheap but light and airy. I liked the print it looked exactly as said.<br />But I gotta return it. Gotta keep the girls in line
1.0,Misleading description and picture. If you're ordering too quickly on mobile it gives the impression that it's a pack of a couple of them instead of individually. The diameter is too small to be functional with no size chart to work off of.
1.0,"Cute cover up for the price. It came faster then I expected, but after reading reviews I ordered a x large to have extra room and I got something maybe my 6 yr. Old grand daughter could wear. Very disappointed. Most of the reviews claimed 185pd and got a x large and they could,have gone with a large,not possible .wish it did fit."
1.0,"I love the feel of these pants, but the leg seam split on the first wear."
1.0,This shirt is too thin. It feels like you can tear the shirt with your finger nails. It looked cool on the pictures but the actual product looks and feels cheap.
1.0,Would not stay on my ear.  I gave it away.
1.0,This tool does not work as advertised. It is nothing more than a plastic cone. If you are short or have short arms and you have a long windshield you will be at a disadvantage as it only extends as far as your arm. I could not reach the middle of my windshield. I took a risk and was disapointed.
1.0,These were silk not cotton.
1.0,its a bad quality hat ...not well finished
1.0,Run too small.
1.0,Came very wrinkled .. not nice packaging. The material is ok. Ok for the price I guess. But the finishing is really bad. Stitches are not well done. uneven and extra strings .. not a good experience
1.0,I got this work one time and it completely stretched out....
1.0,"I did not like the material not as I expected , cheap looking fabric."
1.0,I have a relatively short torso and this was too small for me. I’ll be returning.
1.0,Not the same as the exact same brand
1.0,Tried to put it onto a good casio fishing watch.  Worked for hours and never was able to fit it on.  Finally threw it all away.
1.0,size  and style not matching the picture.. Fabric quality is just ok but at this price could have been better. Waste of money.
1.0,"Fit with this bra was fantastic however, the fabric was super uncomfortable and unfortunately after an hour I had to remove it and return it."
1.0,the Brest area is made for a 10 year old . did not cover any thing
1.0,It's really funky. Material is soft but it is sewn completely shut up at the top. Doesn't give you any shape. I'm 5'9 and ordered this in a small.  Doesn't work for me at all. Hoping it'll look better on one of my friends.
1.0,Disappointed. The cloth came off one of the Velcro straps on the first day. Returning them today.
1.0,Super small and made for a boys body. Not for well built curvy American women.
1.0,they were all to small
1.0,"Beautiful color, nice material..  Length was short, goes to the thigh. Returned for full refund"
1.0,Bought these thinking they would be a nice material and was so wrong. It was a weird shiny almost material that was just gross overall. I didn't like how it fit my body and felt on my skin. I returned right away and don't recommend.👎
1.0,If you regularly use this item it will eventually break. It’s molded metal and eventually fails. I bought it twice and it broke both times in less than 6 months
1.0,I wanted plastic aviators because the metal nose pieces always gets stuck in my hair. These broke so quickly and always sat on my face in an odd way. I would not recommend them.
1.0,Didn't keep anywhere close to accurate time - even after replacing the battery.
1.0,Muy corriente
1.0,Was too small.  I usually wear small. I ordered a medium  to be on the safe side. The medium fits like xs
1.0,The pretty rubber around them comes off... did not hold up very good at all.  Didn’t take long at all to start falling apart.
1.0,This tore after the first Use! Disappointed!
1.0,"Mala calidad , no es blanca como dicen y muy lequeñs"
1.0,Fell apart after first wear.
1.0,Holes for placement of 16mm springbar did not align with holes on my GShock G2310R1. They are worthless and a waste of time and money.
1.0,Inserts to hold bracelet together are hard to insert/hold together.  Will not use because I'm scared to loss my Fit Bit.  Don't like to returns items so I'm not using them.
1.0,"This set was perfect for the first 2 wears. Very comfortable, not too heavy, very breathable & actually flattering! However, after 1 wash the fabric began to fade & pill (see photos). I’m the material began to become see thru too. I was hoping for a good quality piece for $40 but I was disappointed to say the least. After just 2 weeks after purchasing I have returned the item."
1.0,"Super, super long, like ridiculously long with super long sleeves. Stupid."
1.0,"Cute, but very heavy."
1.0,"Heels disintegrate rapidly and eyelet ripped as soon as I tied them up. Poor craftsman ship and material. To expensive. If they would haved held up, I would have bought two."
1.0,Definitely size up like 2 sizes. Way too small
1.0,This smart watch looks great but the bp and pulse readings are totally off.  The wrist band was hard to figure out and difficult to get on the wrist alone.  If I didn’t throw the box away I would return it
1.0,"Dress was too small. It is not true too its size. However, my 10 year old daughter could wear it and it looks very cute on her."
1.0,This shirt was overly large and obnoxious. There can’t be two of us in the room.
1.0,Colors don't match and it was way too big
1.0,nice size but they look so cheap.
1.0,The masks are not rinstone like they look on the website.
1.0,I haven't even gotten to wear this yet and it's already broken!
1.0,The stones were very small and jagged very poor quality
1.0,"Unfortunately these completely fell apart after only a couple hours of wear. I have an older pair of Skidders which we love, but this pair was a different story. I would NOT recommend this item!"
1.0,Fits right in all wrong spots. Too high at the neck and arms. Not comfortable. Makes me look sloppy. Going back.
1.0,"Fits more like a mans shirt, wore it once and probably won’t again"
1.0,Comfortable and snug but the only way they will work is under another pair of socks and/or inside shoes.
1.0,Sooo flimsy. For the price I thought it would be a little better quality! I am in the process of returning it.
1.0,HORRIBLE QUALITY ... Bought one then it broke 2 days after I got it so the sent me a replacement and that one broke THE SAME DAY I GOT IT.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY....
1.0,No way this thing didn't last 2 months
1.0,I wish I hadn't bought this dress made cheap!
1.0,Poor quality and not even close to the size I ordered. No inside tag and cheap fabric.
1.0,Pockets were irregular and they are poor quality.  You get what you pay for.  This one is on me.  Donated them to good will.
1.0,These does not hold up anything! It was such a waste of money. I had to take them off during the event.
1.0,"I ordered the size that my husband usually wears and it was too small. So I think the sizing was wrong, so if you are in doubt order the next size up. I didn't re-order it. It's a nice jacket, but I decided not to re-order it."
1.0,"I am very disappointed with this item. It is not warm at all and feathers get all over my clothing.  It is not what I thought it would be at all. Also, my friend doesn't like hers either."
1.0,Not water proof . Not suitable for skiing .<br />Once water is absorbed very hard to clean . The inside smells bad after couple of usages as it wont completly dry out .
1.0,worst compression socks I have ever owned and I wear these for work. No stretch and the compression is too tight in some spots and loose in others. they fit weird and the design in the socks leaves major imprints in your skin. spend the extra money and get a good brand name compression sock.
1.0,"Poorly engineered yet attractive which makes it even more unsatisfying. Not only does buckle clamp at the belt head fail (it slides off the belt!) the belt itself will start to tear at the hole point where the buckle tine passes through, ripping the length. This is a product that is currently adding to the plastic trash in the Pacific. I feel guilty about ordering it now that I see what it really is."
1.0,I was on my way out went to use it and the zipper is broke!! So mad I had no other red purse!!
1.0,Bought it as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He wore it once and the chain broke-not even at the clasp. Returning it and will<br />purchase another at a local jewelry store.He was so disappointed and so am I.
1.0,Not worth the purchase. No ball at the end and super long. I had to turn the bottom but cheaply made. Do not waste your money
1.0,"The product claims to cover and lift the breasts to make it look like one is wearing a bra without showing on. I tried mine on, it not only didn't stick completely, after moving around (walking) it started to unstick from my skin. It also didn't lift them to where they would be lifted if I was wearing a bra. I was disappointed."
1.0,The pink on my set was not finished. To explain my item was not fully painted several spots where some of the paint had ran to collect and for a sharp point on the nose section that stabs me when worn. This are very cheaply made and are not worth the purchase.
1.0,Charms are flimsy and cheap.  Save your money.  We didn’t get any that are pictured.
1.0,"This is not what I thought it was going to be. I liked the way it looked online, but it looks cheap in person, I know that it was cheap but it looks like it was out of a gum ball machine"
1.0,Two of the charms already fell off. I would not buy this product
1.0,Dislike you can see the line where it was sodered you get what you pay for
1.0,Seriously? I can’t even explain what kind of cheap material this was made out of. Shame on me- I should have known by the price.
1.0,Dress had a hole in it
1.0,Broke right away. If they are kids glasses they should be more durable. Looked great. Just too fragile for children.
1.0,horrible material very thin I really want a refund
1.0,"just not my taste, too BIG!!!! other then that, great. took mine to the consignment store."
1.0,"Just got this today and the minute I put it on the strap loop broke... not good, hoping the seller can send me a new loop"
1.0,Received an empty envelope today without my product. It was supposed to be a christmas prevent- very very disappointing.
1.0,"The fit was off.  It fit OK at the bottom but was way too big at the top, and Im a busty woman. I finally gave it away to a larger woman"
1.0,"I was so disappointed in the quality of this shoe horn.  For the price, I expected at least a nice sturdy plastic and smooth edges.  But, this is made out of a brittle feeling thinnish plastic.  The edges of the plastic are sharp- especially inside of the hole at the top. If you stick your finger in there, it will hurt, and maybe even cut you a little bit. The rough edges on the rest of the shoe horn actually snagged my socks!  This is worse quality than the shoe horns I have received for free in stores. The length is a bit short, but this is as described in the listing.  I received this shoe horn at a discount so that I could offer up my opinion, but I still feel that I paid too much."
1.0,I purchased this outfit and it was too big. Also it looks really cheap.
1.0,Had a bracelet previously with the same clasp and didn't realize I had made the same mistake twice.  Clasp is poor quality and doesn't hold constantly falls off.
1.0,Material is like plastic and looks very cheap.
1.0,Have not received yet. Ordered one month ago. Expected del shown is one week ago. And has changed from orig. Wanted for fall but looks like not going to happen
1.0,Cute product but ruffled hem ripped off after one wash.
1.0,I didn't even get to use them. I took them off the cardboard they are attached to and one of the clasps came apart in my hand. Very cheaply made. I am extremely dissatisfied!
1.0,very uncomfortable size runs small
1.0,Broke as soon as I opened the box.
1.0,"Jacket was worn, had rips in the lining"
1.0,I wear a large and I ordered extra large but it was too small.
1.0,Not true to size and faded after I wore it twice
1.0,"Broke after 3 days of wear. Very cheap, but of course you get what you pay for."
1.0,This material is clearly not meant for a bathing suit. It is very very thin and revealing.
1.0,"Sorry wouldn't recommend, absolutely no foot support, feels cheap, like walking on a piece of thin cardboard. No cushion whatsoever."
1.0,"The blouse is pretty, however, it runs very small in sizes.  I ordered a medium,  and it looks like xmall. Gave it to my niece. So if you are size medium,  you would probably have to order xlarge."
1.0,Shirt runs small. Because of this i need a 3x. But it only runs to a 2x.  Had to return even tho i really loved the shirt. Sleeves and fit accross breast area was tight.
1.0,"Not sure why these gloves have received such good reviews. First time my son wore them the gloves were soaked through and through, his hands were all wet, and the lining on the inside ripped away from the wrist band. In my opinion these gloves are crap."
1.0,"I bought this bracelet in June and the latch broke the next day.  I received a gift card refund.  I bought I second one and it arrived 2 days ago and two of the strings just broke on it.  As pretty as it is, I hoped the first one was just a fluke.  I mean it's not that expensive but it is pretty and my cousin liked it a lot.  So purchasing the second one was not a big deal financially, it's just that the product is not made well at all.  If they used leather like some of the bracelets I have purchased on here, this wouldn't have happened.  I don't suggest buying this bracelet.  It's cheaply made and what's the point in buying something even though it's $3.00 if it breaks after wearing it once?"
1.0,The ring tarnished after wearing it a couple of times.  Beautiful ring but very disappointed with end results. Can't be worn all the time.
1.0,They broke in less than a month.
1.0,Way way way too small also cheaply made. Another item made in China blah blah blah
1.0,The buckle pin is too short.  This band came open on its own on numerous occasions.  Once causing damage to my Seiko black monster after it landed on the concrete.  I would not recommend this watch band to anyone.  Especially if you cherish your watch as I do.  The better band that has heavier hard wear is by waterborne.  This watch is B.S.!!
1.0,Not leather as described in the product details
1.0,"Not only was it not sweatshirt as advertised, I HAVE TO PAY TO RETURN IT!<br />Never again will I purchase from this vendor.<br />DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR."
1.0,"Very disappointed, ordered this as a Christmas gift, opened the box and no bracelet was inside. Nothing."
1.0,The photo is deceptive. It is just a synthetic tee shirt and hood with the pattern printed on it . Not with the money spent. And looks really cheesy I real life. Not insulating value at all.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS WALLET FOR AN ADULT!! It looks cool and the stitching seems durable, but that doesn’t help when the wallet is useless. I got this as a Christmas gift from my wife and was really excited to use it. But every slot and compartment is too small to actually fit anything. Credits cards do not fit in any of the slots and IDs do not fit in the ID holder. I ended up snapping my driver’s license in half trying to cram it into the holder. It might make a good wallet for a child but real money doesn’t fit in the main compartment and sticks out the top of the wallet. Absolutely worthless except as a decoration, which is all I’ll use it for since I can’t return it now. The real tragedy is that I have to go to the DVS and get a new license."
1.0,"I didn't realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought I'd be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back."
1.0,This look like see through stockings. I do not recommend for kids.
1.0,They gotta get returned  They don’t get hit enough
1.0,Upon arrival the belt smelled like Mildew.  You can smell the odor even before opening the package it is so distinct.
1.0,The sale was for 7 items. Only received 6
1.0,Will return
1.0,"After washing the xl, fits like a men's medium!"
1.0,The watch was defective and I returned it immediately.
1.0,the scarf came apart after washed
1.0,Material was thick and hot. Not for me.
1.0,Not very happy! Order these for grandsons for school. Was supposed to be printed group Nope got solid colors a bright pink and a light purple girl colors the other two colors he will wear. If I wanted soild colors would of order soild.So beware if you order these
1.0,My daughter wore it for less than 5 minutes before it started to tear apart at the seams. The material is super thin and cheap. This product is very poorly made. Don’t waste your money. It was really cute and fit her well before it went to pieces.
1.0,Broke necklace... not even half a chain in package and no paw/heart. Took forever to even get it! What a waste of money.
1.0,This dress is so thin you have to wear an undergarment.  You can see right through it. Very embarrassing to wear.
1.0,I thought these were convertible to shorts. They aren’t so I returned them.
1.0,"The title says it's a padded bra.  It isn't.  I am not comfortable going out and about with my nips on full display, which is why I bought this because it said it was padded.  The &#34;padding&#34; is a layer of very thin layer of cloth, which doesn't do anything to prevent nipples from popping out.  I wish companies would stop air-brushing the models too, because if someone wants this look, fine.  But, others like myself simply don't want to go about our lives outside the home with prominent nipples sticking out.  It's becoming next to impossible to find a bra without underwire that has an appropriate amount of padding for us ladies who want full coverage."
1.0,Dislike. Not what I expected.
1.0,Expensive and the Eagle don't look at all like in the pictures. They looked like a couple of brown stains.
1.0,"First off I'm glad I purchased this just to see what all the fuss was about. It was just the right size on me, but it didn't do anything. That buckle for the front? Did nothing! It didn't work at all. Gave me a weird shape. Just a terrible product."
1.0,The size is confusing are the sizes for USA?
1.0,No pocket as picture showed very thin material not what I was expecting  at allll
1.0,For sure 100% size 14G and the ball is HUGE. Not at all practical.
1.0,I didn't like that after it being so small and slinky I have to pay postage return.
1.0,not impressed with the style and the quality
1.0,"My Woodies sunglasses fit perfectly.  They looked great. Lightweight so they stayed on my face well.  After less than one month, my sunglasses broke at the hinge.  It was literally my first day of vacation -- the reason why I purchased these sunglasses.  I carried them in my case so they were smashed in route.  I literally unfolded them and they broke.  $25 is overpriced for 2 opportunities to wear a pair of sunglasses."
1.0,Looks like a big black hefty bag.
1.0,Fabric very very cheap quality
1.0,The image on the shirt is very blurry!!!!!
1.0,"This arrived today and while the other details on the ring are nice, the script is so hammered down that its mushed together and a mess- it is also not centered at all.  Very disappointed:("
1.0,Fell apart in the first day
1.0,Presentation on line was sooooo much bigger than actual cuff links. Soooooo disappointing!
1.0,I hate this bootie! I am an 8 1/2 and that's what I ordered. It fit like a 9 1/2.
1.0,"I am 5'4, and these barely hit the top of my knee cap. I was hoping for a little higher like in the photo. disappointing"
1.0,I was extremely disappointed as I received with pearl broken off earring piece. I am wondering if pearl is just glued onto it. Should have the stem from earring piece into the actual pearl and secured.
1.0,I am so disappointed in this dress!  The front center seam is coming unsewn - about 10 inches in the front middle of the dress.  The fabric is thin and flimsy.  The  quality of this dress is awful!
1.0,"I ordered XL because I like roomy, comfortable clothes. I hate wearing anything tight. But these were way too small. They seemed more like a small than an XL. The fabric was very soft and I'm sure if I could wear them they would be cute and comfortable.<br /><br />I'd order at least 3 sizes up!"
1.0,"I wore this necklace once.<br />Once.<br />It was easy to put on and is very pretty and delicate.<br />BUT.<br />As I was taking it off, the latch broke. There's no way to fix this. I had to throw it away.<br />Terrible!"
1.0,Awful.....the seams were not evenly stitched and actually coming apart in several areas.  Can't wear or ship back.  It was a waste of money.
1.0,Received this product but not as shown are you aware web site. Waist and cargo pockets show a snap button. Received 4 pair of pants with velcro attachment on cargo pockets and a button on the waist. Although I ordered all 32 in waist the quality control for this product is poor. The waist size on the rear label shows 32 but only one pair fit decently three of the other pair was so large they would not cling to my waist. I don't know if I will return these or not or have them altered. I'm completely disappointed
1.0,"I am a petite female and this blouse was so large....I did a double check that it wasn't a ""Plus sizing"" by mistake. Didn't really need to try it on because the bust area was larger than by bottom if you know what I mean. Quality of fabric was nice tho. Too bad they don't offer XS."
1.0,"2 HE MADE THIS ORDER THE SECOND WINE WITH LITTLE HEART EARRINGS NOT LIKE THIS PHOTO , THE FORMER AS IF YOU RECEIVED THIS PHOTO ."
1.0,Way too small wow smothering
1.0,"Way too small, definitely not sized correctly"
1.0,I made sure to order LEATHER. These are NOT leather. These were Cheap but so is the quality. Very disappointed!
1.0,So thin I couldn't find it in its packaging. In fact I even lost it on the first dah
1.0,So tiny!! Too small for an adult! Doesn’t really look like the picture. Looks very cheap.
1.0,Only received the charmander mask and the stitching is terrible on it
1.0,This case literally lasted two weeks and broke. The first one I ordered was scratched too. Don't buy this
1.0,Very ugly the material is cheap looking not what I had expected
1.0,Wasn’t flattering on me one bit…
1.0,Enough said in the title. I was hopeful but I guess you get what you pay for. I want a refund.
1.0,So awkwardly cut. Don’t recommend
1.0,This was a nightmare order.I paid extra for expedited shipping to assure Christmas arrival.Package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until AFTER Christmas -Disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift didn't make it.The shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.They are also impossible to reach-Amazon couldn't even get them on phone.Thank goodness the shoes fit-I can't begin to imagine what a return would have been like. The product is great.
1.0,i ordered a size larger than i usually do and they were too small to even get close to wearing. i ordered the same size in a different brand and they fit fine. shame to this company for using their products to falsely shame women by having inaccurate sizing.
1.0,Not true to size. Do yourself a favor and just dont order clothes from amazon.
1.0,Tarnished as soon as I opened them
1.0,It had a hole in it when I unpackaged it. Definitely cheap quality.
1.0,The watched arrived damaged and in bad conditions with a missing sider. Very disappointed!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY<br /><br />Listing uses photoshopped images so seller can pretend this tiny band will appeal to women. The hardware is a dingy pewter-like gray. The hardware is not shiny silver-tone as it appears in the listing on the many different monitors I have now checked. In fact the color option called gray has a tint of teal to the gray, again a photoshop trick. I purchased the khaki tan watch band, passing on the band called gray because although that band appears a teal tinted gray I passed on the gray.<br /><br />The material is scratchy and itchy and not so funny, in addition awful and flimsy.<br /><br />This band is JUNK"
1.0,I love this look but the chains are tangling up within one minute of wear and you end up with a super messy look. I had to take the necklace down a bunch of times to de-tangle and it was very annoying throughout the day.
1.0,They ate not comfortable n don't really help with swollen legs or feet
1.0,Not chiffon. Fabric looks cheap.
1.0,"I bought this for my dad, and I was sorely disappointed with how badly it fit him. He's a tall guy, and it only went up to his midriff. He couldn't even get his arms through the sleeve because of how tight they were, and this was purchased a size larger than what normally fits. Don't even bother with this. He said it was like wearing a kid's shirt."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Would not order from this company again.
1.0,Overpriced roach clip. No silicone on metal teeth to prevent marring my jewelry. Useless for what I purchased this item to do for me.
1.0,I paid $39.99 for the same watch and it isn't even worth that. It fell apart the first day.
1.0,"I returned, poor quality very light weight cheap  material."
1.0,Stuck into shipping box too small...broke feathers and front. Returned
1.0,Do not buy this product they basically bought a toy shark  then cut the. Bottom out of it with scissors in their house and then stuck clips in it to clip to your shirt.  Looks like something an eight-year-old would. Make  for his Halloween project
1.0,Made out of some type of fake leather that is very thin and easy to puncture. Holds All moisture in and it's not good for if you plan to do any type of work.
1.0,I ordered this bag hoping it was like the one I ordered years ago on Amazon.  The quality is greatly diminished and nothing like I expected.  The ruffled look is not for me.  It looks cheap.  Nothing like my original bag...which by the way I love and people everywhere stop me and compliment me on.  I returned the bag for a quick refund.
1.0,It’s extremely small. More of a toddler hat than an adult hat.
1.0,Cute glasses but broke within 2 months. Buyer beware!!!!!
1.0,I really was excited about this item and happy with it at first. That did not last long. The zipper was always difficult to deal with and then last night it just completely fell off. I wish I would have bought a higher quality item. Do not waste your money like I did.
1.0,Band doesn’t look like the picture. Bad quality. Looks dull and fake
1.0,"It was ill-fitting. The neckline  hung far too low, below the breastbone."
1.0,Doesn’t shield my eyes from the sun. It’s cute for dressing up for Halloween... but doesn’t work in the sun. The glasses is recycled or something and it look like it’s been screwed on with an outside frame and overlaps with another glasses... Apart of the metal frame was sharp and poked me in the face. I really was excited at first now I’m just disappointed...
1.0,The fabric doesn't suit the dress and it looks terrible
1.0,Didnt realize it was stainless instead if surgical. Highly irritated my peircing. Stainless steel is the worth thing to put in a peircing.
1.0,"Looks nice, not true to size"
1.0,"This dress was essentially a box. I thought it would have some shape, but nope, it relies solely on the belt. it's also super thin and very 'slick' material that smells like plastic. if this doesn't convince you and you still want it, size down as it runs very large."
1.0,The plastic is peeling and the support on show isn’t great<br />But they are pretty
1.0,Ordered the 2XL and it truly fit more like a Large. The material is also stiff and scratchy. I am returning these mainly cause the size runs so small.
1.0,This was large and oddly shaped.
1.0,This was the worse bra.
1.0,"This is does not smell or feel like genuine leather at all. Its synthetic.  Pls say the truth and AMAZON should verify this claim, its misleading."
1.0,Fake.  Not Varnet. Real Varnaut have mineral crystal lenses and logo on earpieces. Also they are $280 at  varnaut.com.
1.0,I am a size 12 I ordered these in XXL and they fit like a 6 or 8 glad I gave free returns the sizing is awful
1.0,This was way too big and I had a hard time keeping a rubber band on it.
1.0,The tank barely covered my chest and shirt was not oversized- it fit well but not oversized
1.0,Didn't really like how my chest looked. Definitely not the same as described. Not worth it.
1.0,"cheap, broken within a week"
1.0,The waistband and cuffs did not match the velour material in color. Jacket is too short and pants don’t fit right.
1.0,"Awful, does not fit j7 prime"
1.0,Turned my ankle green and broke almost immediately
1.0,Flimsy and extremely cheap
1.0,The package came on time but instead I got rings instead of earrings unfortunately I cannot return them they don't fit anybody in my household pretty
1.0,"Too bulky, too long & the red color is not Red enough; too light"
1.0,The disability and warranty of this product is less then poor. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase them. I only wore them to work for 2 months and they are taking apart.
1.0,Despite the information saying that it ran slightly Small it actually was a little too big and I had to go to extra route of actually sending it back. My wife really wanted to keep it but it was just too big and it made more sense to send it back.
1.0,The product that was displayed on line is a complete opposite I was very disappointed 😞
1.0,This tie is thinner than advertised.  I would like to return for full refund.
1.0,The band wouldn't snap into my gear fit 2.
1.0,Thought it would be a wallet and not a rubber band and 2 pieces of aluminum.
1.0,"Seriously, my face isn't small and these glasses are WAY too large."
1.0,Nope. It broke
1.0,This hoodie runs very small. I ordered a 2xl and it looked more like a medium and the material was not what the description said it was.
1.0,"EDITED to one star 5/19: Reviee for $12.99 items with netting on top of fabric. After writing the review below I wore the black one last night. It left black dye on my bedding. Must wash hair again. Hopefully hair is ok and I can remove dye from bedding. Buyer beware!  Grrr...<br /><br />I realize that the fit is relative to your head size but I purchased another brand that was just a little too tight. These fit securely but are still comfortable for my head. I am taking away one star because, like most of these types of head wraps, the shiny, smoothest side DOES NOT face your hair! To keep ladies from rubbing their hair off while sleeping, the shiny, smooth side must be the side touching their hair. A double layer of fabric with the inner side of the bottom layer touching the hair also being smooth and shiny would completely solve this problem. Manufacturers please do this and advertise this fact."
1.0,Horrible stretching and non fit after first wear
1.0,Dangle fell off on day one. cute though.
1.0,Horrible material. It looks like it was cut out with a hole puncher for the detail. And return is almost $6 so all around bad!
1.0,"The stem broke off from the base. Pretty, but won’t buy again."
1.0,"Loved it at first wore it once, I put it in the washer, hung to dry and it shrank. I want my money back. Not worth it. Don’t buy."
1.0,"I really loved the idea of this dress but it’s disappointing in reality.  The top is poorly constructed.  The straps are not even or adjustable.  The smocked part is too long and there are strings coming unstitched.  It’s not flattering.  Makes me looks like I have rolls going on where I don’t.  The back tie does nothing structurally.  Unfortunately this is a return.  I’m 5’4, 125lbs, 34D."
1.0,"Bought this for my son who trains regularly. After his 4th training session, one side started to leak. So I returned it."
1.0,This is very itchy if wearing alone. Maybe if you wear it with a long sleeve shirt underneath it might not be so itchy. But I don't like the material at all.
1.0,"This is an oddly shaped dress. It fit okay, but the bottom edge was so tight against my thighs...it was uncomfortable to walk or sit down."
1.0,"I ordered two of these for gifts and they both arrived broken right out of the package. Considering the location where they were broke was the same on each necklace, I'm going to assume it's not something that happened in shipping and that instead it is of really poor quality. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but I was expecting it to be in one piece."
1.0,"within LESS than 1 week of purchasing this watch, not only did the entire screen break, the band snapped, and it got water damage from jumping into a pool of 3ft (my arm went under for a moment or two, not submerged, not deep). INCREDIBLY disappointed in how poorly made this product was. Complete waste of money."
1.0,Hated the material this shirt is made out of. Looks cute in the picture but is downright ugly. Worst part is I accidentally ordered 2 of these.
1.0,"Way too small, thin material, poor quality, surprised Amazon would sell this product as they are usually outstanding"
1.0,"I purchased this watch about a year ago on Amazon from this particular seller (May 30th, 2013) . The main reason that I am giving one star is part of the screen stopped working and it got water in it. The watch was supposed be water resistant. But It started getting water in it. After it got water I put it under sun to dry it for one day the water is gone but the part of the screen where the seconds are stopped working. I am a big G-Shock fan but I suggest you to not buy this model."
1.0,Bra delivered with one C cup and one A cup (or less than A) with clasp installed upside down on one side.
1.0,The worst quality ever..
1.0,"Loved the packaging! Doesn’t look cheap, have one star because it doesn’t fit. Apparently my large nostrils won’t allow this dainty nose ring to fit"
1.0,3 out of 5 packs received in torn/open condition. Packaging has been tampered.
1.0,"I am 5'4, 129lbs, athletic. Really disappointed. When I saw these cargo pants, they reminded me of the late '90s punk grunge and I was excited to buy them. However, when I got them they were too short. They were high waist which I absolutely despise high waist pants. I could not pull the pants all the way up because they got caught at the top of my thighs. Therefore they felt baggy in the crotch. They look like a tight fit around the butt but that's after me yanking them up, which means they went past my belly button at one point."
1.0,"The dress I received did not have the same pattern as the picture. The shape of the dress is also different than pictures, more of an A line swing dress than a skater dress."
1.0,Literally just put it on today and the side zipper came apart in less than 2 hours and it wasn’t right either.
1.0,They turn green and they are very small I could not even screw the bottoms on the piercings
1.0,There are not enough loops to make this fit properly.
1.0,Too long and cheap
1.0,"Please do not waste your money..this is just a piece of trash that has been sold to me. very low quality, pictures don't reflect the actual cheap make. I won't buy again nor recommend it to a friend"
1.0,Love the bracelet very pretty but it came with a missing rhinestone
1.0,"The pictures are incorrect, the glasses are clearly yellowish/stained. They appear to be adult sized and inappropriate for children. One of mine appear to be used as it was splashed with a sticky brown substance that looked as though it was coca cola or some other soda, and it had scratches. The quality is poor.<br /><br />I had intended on buying these as protective goggles for nerf wars but I will try something else.<br /><br />Don't buy these."
1.0,Not what is pictured. Not ripped. its printed
1.0,Can’t get wrist band to attach to watch. Please provide assistance
1.0,Magnet won't stay in send a new one
1.0,This swimsuit looks horrible.  Cheap materials! Not recommend at all.
1.0,"This thing is just awful.<br />First, it’s described as grey. The photos on the product listing definitely show a grey cardigan with solid grey inside. The one I received is a grayish purple color.<br />Second, the product description says it’s cotton & polyester. The actual item says its 95% polyester & 5% spandex. It’s a shiny thin material that reminds me of cheap costumes.<br />Also, it doesn’t fit well the shape is weird. The collar is high but it’s just material that’s cut weird so it doesn’t lay well around your neck.<br />Pass on this. It’s a waste of $20."
1.0,Worst material looks dam cheap quality
1.0,They are oversize sunglasses.
1.0,Horrible dnt waste UR money VERY thin not long enough must be a child on the pic because THAT'S who it's made 4
1.0,The hats just fell right out. It would not hold the hats.
1.0,I feel this was very uncomfortable would not suggest to buy
1.0,Very disappointed.  Very cheaply made
1.0,"So cute, but sooooo small. I am so sad. I got a large and it was T I N Y!!! :("
1.0,"It’s not what I expected!, I’m 5’3” 140lbs curvy, ordered medium and fits big and it’s too long. This might look better on someone taller since it fell mid calf on me. I will be returning  it."
1.0,"Cheap material, not designed right."
1.0,The wallet did not block a rfid card.  That makes me think it doesn't work.
1.0,Very pretty.love the color.
1.0,"Horrible looks like pic feels light like a piece of paper that makes the sound of an empty soda can.  Jus a waste of money, do not buy its not worth it you will be disappointed and very upset."
1.0,Advertised color completely inaccurate.  Tampa Bay Bucs are not bright yellow. Delivery window not accurate either. Received shirt almost a month after order and weeks after the superbowl.
1.0,The shorts part has a thick lining that is totally visible though a form fitting dress. Kinda defeats the purpose when people can tell you're wearing something underneath. Definitely returning!
1.0,"I loved this shirt when I first got it. It fits nicely and is very soft. It stayed soft and didn’t shrink in the wash, so after two wears I would have given this shirt 5 stars. However, I wore it a third time and washed it and it now has a tear in the armpit. I expect a t-shirt to last for more than three washes. This is not a quality product."
1.0,"I normally wear a small, so just to be on the safe side, I ordered a medium. Yah.......I should have ordered a large or XL! Oh, and it’s super see-through. So if you’re in to tiny and see-through swimsuits, this is the one for you!"
1.0,This chain broke within 10 minutes of use.
1.0,way too big take up half of my face!!! cheap made
1.0,The material is thin and shiny. The material reminded me more of cheap underwear than anything made for a workout. There is no compression. All over disappointed and returned.
1.0,bad .i don't like
1.0,Supppper Long.  Cheap material used and it shows.  This item feel apart in one weeks worth of use.  Terrible product.  I am so sorry I wasted by hard earned money on this.  Will not order this item or from this seller again.  Other buyers be warned.
1.0,As i took it out from the plastic wrap I notice that the necklace was already busted.  4 or 5 strands were busted.
1.0,They were not what i wanted. How do ivreturn?
1.0,They fall off so easily. Even when you’re taking off your shirt the backs fall off.
1.0,"Does not fit watch, even though description says it will. Not even close. Too wide for inside the band arms."
1.0,I got these at a discount for a review. I'm not impressed with these. The silver one took a small lens screwdriver just to open it. I can't say that I'd put that in because how would I get it off again if I can hardly open it? The black ring was easier to open but misaligned so that's out too because it would tear at my skin. The only one that seemed to be ok was the gold one. Fairly unhappy with the product.
1.0,Complete GARBAGE!!!
1.0,Worst purchase I’ve ever made! The inside is some cheap polyester open weave and the whole thing was a huge disappointment! Never ever order this!
1.0,Very cheap materials wear it ones and got a hole on it
1.0,would fit a 10year old at best....not a full size adult male.
1.0,Got this for my daughter. Cheaply made (obviously look at the price) broke the second day she wore it.
1.0,They hug my toes a little too tight :(
1.0,I loved these shoes but unfortunately this was my third pair. They all broke within weeks of me wearing them. My last pair I had for only 8 days when they broke while walking into a store. I will not be purchasing them again.
1.0,Again I couldn’t wear it it was to small
1.0,This item runs very small I would order next size up or two to fit
1.0,"It's horrible. I purchased a 10in locally and it was a bit too short for me, so I decided to purchase a 12in and the material is totally different from the 10in. It even got torn trying to put it on. I wish I could send it back for a refund, but I'm in the Caribbean. Totally waste of money. I had to give a star, that's there's  they got 1"
1.0,It's advertised as a bellybutton ring but it's so tiny it's a nose ring.
1.0,"Stitching was off..... material was cheap.  But u get what u pay for, 6 bucks!"
1.0,"I received and open the package,  The wig was ok,  but again nothing like the picture on the Amazon Page,  The beard had no defined mustache and the mouth hole was not cut out  Very bummed of the Quality,  I would say  you get what you pay for,  except for the misleading pictures.  VERY MISLEADING!!!!"
1.0,"These are thin, not plus size, scratchy , not soft or comfortable- definitely more like tights should not be described as leggings and they do not look like the photo especially in the waistband"
1.0,Cheap! Not happy at all. Too large and looks cheap trying to return it and was told since it cost more to return it company in China offered10% pay back. This is BS!  I have bought other bands on amazon and love them. Very disappointed
1.0,Product misrepresented
1.0,The material was thin and not silk or satin which is a disappointment and the leopard pattern is nothing like the picture. Also it’s super short. I’m 5’1” and the top came just below my belly button so I have no idea how a taller person would wear this. I ordered the medium and around the breast of tight and I’m 119lbs and a 32DD so there’s that to consider. I’m disappointed and returning it.
1.0,"These are beautiful earrings and the pair I purchased were given to my daughter for Christmas. They looked great, but broke the 2nd time she tried to wear them. We would've had better luck buying a cheaper pair at Claire's."
1.0,the stones fell out 2 days  after wearing  them
1.0,I ordered the correct size but the toe part is too long. Makes you trip.
1.0,"Cute, but runs EXTREMELY SMALL. I ordered a size up from my normal sz & was still WAY too tight."
1.0,This product is advertised as black and turquoise. I received one that is silver and white and looks very generic. Save your money and buy somewhere else.
1.0,"The top fits very small through the body and then huge at the cups. The print is not cute, in person, either. I am not sure if I ordered this thinking that there would be an underwire component, but there isn’t. It’s a cheap top that I used for my son’s swim lessons. Definitely won’t use it anywhere else."
1.0,I ordered one size bigger and it still didn't fit
1.0,These socks were horrible. The sizing was not right either... at all!! They didn't even come high as they are supposed to .
1.0,One of the studs upon opening the package was lose in the bag.  Tried putting them back together but the one earing doesn't hold the stud in place. About one week ago i wore them and the stud fell off. Now i cannot wear them anymore.
1.0,The bat was fine it was the peeling stickers that's not worth spending almost $30 on I could have bought a bat and stickers myself in that case waste of money. the shop owner could have did a better job at placing the stickers on the bat. I had to peel the stickers off to fix the creases in it. Never again will I buy from this shop.
1.0,"> Fair warning!! I didn’t see it didn’t come with the lanyard until I scrolled through the photos *after* I bought it. I didn’t see it in the description.<br /><br />I wanted this because I love RM and it was super cute in the photo. It comes in the mail and I don’t have the lanyard. It’s not worth the money. After tax, it’s way to expensive to just have the mask and not the other piece to go with it. 1 star."
1.0,These gloves do not stay on my 20 month old.
1.0,"I was excited to receive my hat, but opened the box and realized it was the wrong color."
1.0,"REVIEW UPDATE.<br /><br />THESE SOCKS SUCK! I've washed a couple of them and they're ok but others already linted up! Not to mention, THEY DO NOT FIT HIM!!!!!! The only reason he can wear any them is because they're crew socks so there's extra room for him. the heel of the sock is at the arch of his foot. Spend the extra dollar or two and get better socks.<br /><br />Waste of money.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Just received these and I have to say, it's less than expected. There's only 1 with the bottom grip and the rest are just either crew or low-cut socks. Quality on a couple feel pretty decent but majority feels pretty thin and not that cute. I would say 3/4 of them looks tacky and cheap.. They work for wearing at home but I wouldn't put them on him to go out. I'll spend a couple dollars more and get better looking & quality ones instead. Maybe will even donate them too.<br /><br />I also wouldnt say these are sized 1-4YO. My son turns 2 next month and these barely fit him."
1.0,"These are very small... Sizing is awful.  If you are little, you will love them, they are cute, but way too small.  I ordered the XL, is about a size 6 US"
1.0,"I was excited to find goggles with positive correction and I was amazed at the clear vision the first time in the pool.  However, this is where my excitement ended.  I could never get them to seal around my eyes and it became a nuisance to empty them after every lap in the pool.  I believe the bridge material is too stiff and the eye cups are small and not soft enough to make a good seal.  I gave up after a few weeks of trying and I had to buy my prior brand that does not offer correction but seals flawlessly."
1.0,Shrank so small and inconsistent could not be worn. Sent back.
1.0,"If I could give this product and company 0 stars, I would! First of all, the material sucks! The sizes are not true. The queen pants are very tight and do not fit well around the foot. The king sweats are also tight and are not made to fit a mans package. The hoodies are actually decent but they are really heave which is good for winter time but I love my hoodies all year round. Upon receiving these and wearing these one time and making sure they fit, I washed them...as you do with all the clothes you buy! As I was hanging them up I notice a hole in the crotch of the queen pants! A hole right at the seam! These were poorly sewn and cheap meaterials are used. I requested an exchange of the queen sweats only! Not even a refund even though I don't particularly like them! I just wanted a pair of sweats, ones without a hole! But they denied my request! I paid a total of $120 bucks for these two outfits and I am furious! This company sucks! These outfits suck! And I really hope you think twice before buying these! Don't waste your money!"
1.0,I do not have a ball on my hat but the girl on the advertisement has one on hers. 😡😡
1.0,"I thought this would be a decent sun hat at a decent price, but unfortunately, the inside even with the one size fits all band is so huge, the band didn't touch my head at all to hold it up.  It was like wearing a bucket.  I have a medium size head so this must have been modeled on a basketball.  Secondly, it has the texture that reminds me of those newer wal-mart associate vests they have marked up as each being made using 6 plastic water bottles.  I had to submit for return."
1.0,"These were way too big considering it’s a kids size, it can easily fit an adult."
1.0,"Had many expectations, but it does not look like the picture, it's color instead of black is violet coffee or something like that.<br />The fabric desapoint me, looks too cheap."
1.0,Poorly made... Mine was broken.<br />Not worth it
1.0,Hard to get the cards out
1.0,I was looking for a RED hat. You called this red.  It is a dusty maroon or burgundy not red. Please correct your colors.
1.0,Poorly made with a lot of extra string and the elastic on the pants was pretty tight
1.0,I wore them once and they began to split. Low quality.
1.0,it was a mess! it fell apart. I thought a few loose feathers would come out so I shook it a bit over the bathtub and the thing nearly fell apart. I don't recommend you purchase this boa. feathers wouldn't stop coming off. It made a mess of my outfit and my bathtub!
1.0,"Just pass on this one. It was so cute in my septum at first but after like a few days of wear it started to irritate my nose. I just took it out before deciding to write this review to find the inner part of the ring covered in GREEN CRUST!! After changing it out and putting in a higher quality piercing from an Etsy seller, my septum immediately felt better. Please spare your piercing and give your money to someone else."
1.0,I thought I ordered Alex and Ani this popped into my search and I was not aware.  Was really small..was not flexible like Ani bracelet.  Was discolored out if the box. Not a good purchase:( I can see how charm would fall off.
1.0,"Well I would love to find the ring from the picture, because what I got was far off. The sizing was wrong, the skull looks like a cartoon character that just got hit in the face with a frying pan, instead of a nice gunmetal grey, I got obnoxious chrome, and the details look like they were drawn by a toddler with Parkinson’s."
1.0,I loved this bad but it broke after two weeks
1.0,"Lasted almost two weeks before the lens frame cracked and lens fell out. I own a couple different pairs of Merry's that I am happy with, but the quality of this product is not on par with their other options."
1.0,No sure if I asked for an invisible watch. But this is what I got. Do better
1.0,Small would for a child. Sent back.
1.0,still does not help putting on a necklace with long nails.
1.0,I order a size 1x it came extremely small. Couldn’t button it up. I tried contacting someone to return it they never sent me a packing receipt to return back to them.
1.0,"after wore three times, got a big hole. no worth to buy"
1.0,Way smaller then expected :(
1.0,"My daughter bought this with her babysitting money for her and her best friend for Christmas.  My daughter is only 12 and wanted a really special gift for her best friend.  She looked for days to find a unique present and was very excited when she found this.  We ordered it and when it arrived she wrapped it really pretty and gave it to her best friend.  Her best friend put it on right away and within the hour the charm fell off and was lost in the school.  My daughter wore hers the same day and her charm kept falling off so she took the bracelet off and put it in her locker.  My daughter was very embarrassed that she gave her best friend such an awful gift that fell apart so quickly.  This is the first time she has ever ordered a gift online and it will be her last time.  Unfortunately, you have lost a potential long term customer!!!"
1.0,I didn't even get the product listed
1.0,"Fabric pills after 1 wash, dropped shoulder seam fits weird, especially after 1st washing, seam is tighter than sleeve now"
1.0,Stuck together couldn’t get paper off without foam tearing
1.0,Well made but Outfit runs extremely small. Very disappointed because it’s so adorable!
1.0,"Glasses have tag with a couple of cancer risk warnings, including a warning concerning metallic nickel. Glasses do look great, however."
1.0,"Buckles not attached, where is the instructions on how to put together.  Had them for a week now and can't figure out how to get them attached to the strap."
1.0,Opened and put it right back in the bag to return. Didn’t even try on. Very cheap looking fabric and construction. Not at all as pictured.
1.0,"What can I say?  I guess I am the sucker for spending $30+ with tax on a hat that looked cool on a website.<br /> This hat way too small for an ""adult size"" / ""one size fits all"".  I tried going all the way down to the last two snaps, and it still tight on my head, making the hat look bad, and it feels like I am going to get a migraine.  I have multiple other hats of similar style, and I usually have at least 4 snaps left.  Additionally, the mesh back of the hat is very thin and feels cheaply made.  The mesh also has a permanent crease on each side from the way the hat was stored in inventory that does not want to ""flatten"" out.  Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase and plan to give it to one of my nephews as a Christmas gift, since they are children whose heads might fit this hat better."
1.0,Runs small and it was a stain on front of blouse small but noticeable.
1.0,Looked great but after a couple hours just wearing arounf the house the grommets holding the tinesfell out. I loosened them to the next set and the same thing happened. A piece of string would have been better.
1.0,I was very confused when I opened the package because it didn't even look like something I would order. I had to look at my order history to see that the dress I got was supposed to be this one. Yikes.
1.0,"Uhh, the tie is nice, but the No-Return policy is complete BS! The color was not what I wanted. Never tried it on, never even out of the package. I will never do business with Mendeng again."
1.0,"The size was way too small! It looked like it could barely fit a toddler, and the tag said it was Women's XL!<br />Knew it was too good to be true with the price..."
1.0,Wasn't loose as expected. Can't even button the sleeve
1.0,"This was a low quality product, they fall apart after 1-3 uses and the offing really isn’t that great."
1.0,"The material isn’t soft at all, it’s actually kinda rough feeling on your skin, it’s very cheaply made material for being name brand pants…I was expecting way better quality honestly. I’ve bought cheap sweatpants that weren’t even name brand & they feel way better than these pants do. Very disappointed in quality of pants. I personally would NOT recommend anyone buying these."
1.0,Looks nice in the photo but not up close.
1.0,I liked the color and style. It is supposed to be high impact and it is not. I expected it to hold the girls with none to little bounce and that is not the case. Fabric is too stretchy.
1.0,Not great material....not what I expected from the description and picture
1.0,"The package I received after ordering the item came the next day, but it was EMPTY! NO BAND WHATSOEVER WAS INSIDE."
1.0,These look like silky panties with zero cotton and no tie dye! Junky and not worth it.
1.0,"Way to small. I could fit into it, but would not dare wear in public. Designed for slim gals!"
1.0,This bra was too small had no support and fall off 1 hour into my event.
1.0,"Wouldn't melt., used 1000° + torch.. don't waste money"
1.0,"The fabric felt soft, but I cannot comment on fit or shape retention as the color I ordered was wrong (so I didn't even bother trying it on or keeping it). My low rating is because the color I ordered was misrepresented. I ordered ""aria aqua."" On the screen, it looked exactly like the color I wanted. However, their idea of this color is what can better be described as ""baby blue."" It is NOT the color pictured. Even accounting for the color differences that customers see depending on their monitor, you cannot label a color as aqua when it is baby blue in real life. That is completely misrepresenting the product. I'm so disappointed."
1.0,I dislike the fact that it wasn’t what I thought it was and what it said that she was it’s not
1.0,Too small. Fabric was horrible. Returned.
1.0,"So incredibly disappointed in these. Thought I had finally found some beautiful masks and have been so excited for them to get here. Turns out that they are indeed like “swimsuit material“ that I saw in another customer’s review. These are absolutely not cotton at all. The opening in the back for the filter is on the very edge of the mask and not towards the middle of the mask. Yes, they stretch very well because they are not cotton and they’re very lightweight because of the flimsy nylon material. Super disappointing and completely feel like these were misrepresented by the seller."
1.0,I'm petite and thin and used the measurement guide. I couldn't get this on. It was too short for my body and I have a short torso already! There was a gap in the back like it was way too big around the middle. Apparently it's for a very short fat person with no arms. It doesn't open in the back like it should so the material was torn. The material is cheap like paper. Anything will rip it and there is no stretch. This is NOT dance apparel. Do not buy. It's a scam.
1.0,Ordered a large and a medium - huge discrepancy in size.
1.0,"Returned. Get an XL even if you normally wear a medium, and hope it fits. Sizing is way off."
1.0,It was suppose to be red its orange
1.0,I thought this was going to be cotton/linen fabric but it’s definitely polyester and very tight fitting. This would be SO cute in cotton - please make it! Lol
1.0,"I ordered a green, Grinch mask to cheer people up when I went to the hospital for regular treatments. After weeks of waiting for delivery, and sending several messages to seller requesting refund, I received this cheap, polyester mask with a sports logo on the side. It's totally useless, super thin, falls off, and extremely uncomfortable. NEVER buy from this seller."
1.0,It was broken and in the image looks big and it is not
1.0,I ordered XL size and it's very small I'm usually size M or L but the XL it's like Small size I do not recommend to buy this pants unless you are size small. Also it's not expanded.
1.0,Was going to be used for a trip to Mexico.
1.0,To large and to long
1.0,"I bought it in  red watermelon and looks nothing like the picture - it is hot pink! The arm whole is very small. Also nothing like the picture. The fabric is smooth, but it looks like cheap mesh. Very disappointed."
1.0,The little penguin - the whole reason I purchased this in the first place - fell off after just a few weeks. Piece of garbage.
1.0,The little stones fell out.
1.0,"Was not as described on TV. Was comfortable, but provided no support even with the removable cups."
1.0,Bad quality. Do not absorb much sweat.
1.0,Looked like a boxy table cloth. Returned.
1.0,Did not function! It was delivered broken!
1.0,Sub quality. This actually had PAPER sewn onto the elbows! No good at all. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY
1.0,Top is incredibly stiff and bra area is misplaced. Sewing pins that were not only left in the dress but left with the ball heads sewed into the actual seams of the dress making it impossible to remove them without cutting a hole in the dress fabric itself.<br /><br />Sequins were poorly attached and loose strings were everywhere. They were also attached at such an angle to where it was impossible for them not to scratch against any poor exposed skin (under arms/chest/back) it was near.
1.0,Did not receive the product listed or pictured.  Wife was irate.
1.0,"I received the same manufacturer and size which was purchased from Kohls expecting the same quality. It is a thinner scratcher material, and they used less material. Very unhappy."
1.0,I wear a size 14 and ordered an XXL named on other's comments and still way to small.  I am returning.
1.0,"Poor quality, see through fabric, poplin, oversized"
1.0,"Unfortunately these are very short earrings, also they are gauage  higher than a normal earring post. I cannot even get it through my holes. Sadly, cause I was really looking forward to these."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c51516eb7b71473317d983dea62c286c]] These bracelets are very cute but you have to size them to your arm and once their size to your arm if you keep it on for a full day removing at night you will see that there's green substance on your arm I would not recommend these to anyone
1.0,I like the color but it was way to small. I purchased a XXL and it ended up getting a niece that is a size 8.
1.0,The middle seam on the bodice was not in the middle or go in a straight line. And button placement didn't help it look any better. The fabric was nice and style cute but construction was not great.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. This is a cheaply made item.
1.0,They were very cute and liked the simplicity of them..I wore them for about 2 hours then my fingers started to turn green from them.. Would not recommend
1.0,Tacky tacky tacky and CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP
1.0,Poor quality spandex fabric.
1.0,They look super cute but don’t grip the card that was a total fail. So I wouldn’t purchase them again.
1.0,I would give zero stars if it were possible. I purchased more than one to give as gifts.  They arrived wrong size.  Looks like rain gear fabric and is not as described.  Requested a return and no one is responding.
1.0,doesn't secure cell phone. no wrist band..waste of money
1.0,It was just like you listed it but so some reason it just started falling apart over the place.  Would not recommend this item.
1.0,"These boots are cute and fit well, but after 1.5 months of normal wear, the sole is coming off."
1.0,The sizing is very different from what I am accustomed to. I ordered a similar outfit and checked the sizes. I did not notice that this was a different company with different sizes. The material in this outfit was also more sheer.  Haven't figured out what to do with it yet.
1.0,Sand Paper
1.0,I love the design as well as the thickness of the collar. However within 15 minutes of placing the collar on my dog and going for a walk it snapped and broke while on a walk. Although I have a big dog he does not pull while on walks and is completely trained yet the collar snapped with light tension.
1.0,"This is a joke. Doesn’t hold. It bends, but it’s so flimsy that it doesn’t make any difference"
1.0,"terrible quality of shirt. I've had dish towels that were softer. the fabric is very poor, which reflects the price."
1.0,"So sad i got them and they where frayed and stained some how for ""new"" shirts.... Just tossed them in the trash...."
1.0,Not i was expecting
1.0,Not actual Bedhead PJs.  Fake.
1.0,This band will unclip itself from the pins if the band is flexed against the watch body. I will not wear this band in any situation in which it could be permanently lost.
1.0,Never received but no refund!
1.0,Please note the description... they are SMALL... like kids size...
1.0,"Not for women with curves or who plan to wear underwear. Also, it didn't fit right our the shoulders, it bunched up there."
1.0,Very flimsy.  Arms are loose and very cheap.
1.0,"3 big tags right in the back and crack of your butt. Makes ZERO sense.<br />Over $100 for leggings where you can’t rip out the tags that irritate and scratch your back and butt. No thanks.<br />All of their tights have these 3 tags in the back, yet they go through the trouble of stamping Spanx on the leggings. Dumb."
1.0,Headaches
1.0,I was suppose to Black moon star but I got to blue Moon star instead I’m very disappointed because I want what I ordered so I’m returning the product.
1.0,They lasted for about 2 weeks before I threw them in the trash  terrible product
1.0,Oh my! I normally read reviews but I was in such a rush to get this ordered that I failed to do so. The material is of poor quality and the words are not on the sleeve(as I see in some of the pictures NOW). Very unhappy with this purchase and I definitely will be returning.
1.0,The size is completely off! Runs very small. The color is much darker than in picture.
1.0,"I missed the portion of information stating that holes were not included. I’d have ordered a hole-maker for the belt but that negates the need for a new belt all together. Buyer beware: reading comprehension required, ;)"
1.0,Slit is not how it shows in the picture and the fabric came with pulls in it.
1.0,They worked perfectly... until i got home; i wore them for about 6 hours and when i took them off the clip fell apart completely. It's a shame
1.0,nice looking and feeling glasses however they do not clean east and have a foggy greasy film after cleaning.  Not as clean or crisp as I thought they would be and actually are kind of cloudy. Stopped wearing them after a few days of usage due to them being worse than not wearing them.
1.0,"Looks can be very deceiving; if you are going for looks only, these work superbly.<br />If you want to see without glare, find another brand; they do not cut ANYglare."
1.0,"I'm a Medium fit (bordering on a Large) and these tank tops were way too big and too long for me; the bottom of the tank covered my short pockets. Also, upon seeing them in person, I didn't care for the design either."
1.0,"We bought this umbrella at the end of March.  It was probably the end of April before we even put it up as we needed to buy a stand.  This morning, six weeks later, I noticed it already has two small tears in it.  They may have been there all along and I just never noticed them.  All I know is that the umbrella was not damaged by us in any way.  Do not buy this brand."
1.0,This crow came broken. :( Missing a piece of its foot. And the other foot was loose and fell out.
1.0,Uneven and small.
1.0,"Got the white shirt- Too large, see-through, and no stretch! Returning this!"
1.0,Made outta polyester... Looked HORRIBLE (Like a tent) (ended up donating)
1.0,Bought this hat several times over the years. This one was definitely not the same and I'm not a fan of the changes made at all.
1.0,"This material is not worth the purchase, and it is also stiff."
1.0,"It is not a sweater and it does not have a hoodie, as they stated it did.  It is tee shirt material with no hoodie."
1.0,I received the item and charged the headphones one time. The sticky surface on the back of the velcro which holds the control module in place wasn't strong enough and so the control module and ear phone moved throughout the beanie. I didn't even get to use the product one time. Very disappointed in the quality of the product
1.0,"Didn’t like the material, has a “rough cotton texture”. Also, see through!"
1.0,More like Mediums than Xtra Large
1.0,Weird white border around it? Quality is meh...
1.0,Charm is so small you can hardly see it let along read it. Definitely nothing to commemorate such an important event.  Extremely disappointed in it and sent it back immediately.
1.0,These shirts are not regular fit.  More like a slim fit.
1.0,"Kind of upset that it’s not at all what I expected.. it’s kind of cheaply made and I paid 30$ for it just for it to be way to large. It runs like a size or two up.. and the stitching is terrible. The sleeves aren’t even like the picture. I read the reviews and still took a chance.. but I regret it. There is also spots on the back, I’m not sure what it is.. but ugh. I regret it and I don’t even want to go through a hassle of getting a refund.<br />This is the first negative review I have ever done.<br />I don’t even think I’m going to give it to my son as a Christmas gift."
1.0,"This jacket is every bit  as bad as the bad reviews say.  I took a chance despite the bad reviews and I regret it.  This jacket smells like mildew.  The ""red"" is very orangey.  The sleeves are tight. The fabric is stiff, itchy, and has no stretch.  Finally, and worst of all, the pattern on this jacket is not the same as the item pictured.  I was drawn to the large squares in the pattern on the jacket in amazon's picture, but the squares in the pattern of the jacket I recieved are much smaller.  Everything about this jacket is disappointing and ugly.  My husband said it looks worse than something a used car salesman in an old movie would wear."
1.0,I went by the measurements online and I bought the size recommend it. It was 2 sizes too big. The cost of exchanging was as expensive as the pants. So I gave them away. I don’t recommend these pants nor the seller because you’d be charged to exchange Little Rock return. Too big!
1.0,I give zero stars the dress came ripped at the seams and the material is so cheap & see through
1.0,"I don't even know what this is that I got. My husband threw away the packaging, otherwise I would return it."
1.0,"I felt like I was naked.  Flimsy, thin fabric."
1.0,"I bought these because I was looking for more styles like the ones I'd bought from another company on here. The pocket placement on these is not like the photo, and they look just awful. The pockets are hilariously tiny compared to the photo. I'm so upset because the fabric is gorgeous and I couldn't wait for them to come. They fit but they look terrible and id never wear them out."
1.0,Beautiful shoes but too narrow.
1.0,The bra fits weird and creates a uni-boob appearance. I will definately not wear this.
1.0,"Broke the first time I opened/closed the cuff to put it on.<br />Too much of a hassle to send it back,  so I ate the price.  Maybe I can use it for something else, by super gluing that cuff shut some how⁉❕❓"
1.0,The dress is completely see through. Material is paper thin. Returned
1.0,"do not buy, bad enuff I had to wait forever for it to come this hat is defective!!! In the middle of the hat on the top of the hat it has a huge crease & will not stand up straight!!!"
1.0,"Hat came destroyed, bent and wrinkled. Terrible hat. Worth less than $0.50"
1.0,"Distorted lenses aid your vision very little.  Cheaply made -- I've had mine for only 8 months and the brittle plastic on the right arm at the joint (see pic) already broke, even with extremely gentle handling. Now the glasses won't even stay in place with the broken arm.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"broke before I could even wear it,"
1.0,I ordered my size didnt fit
1.0,Who wears them?! They look ridiculous especially the front Looks like you have a huge forehead & puffy.
1.0,"It fit as expected, but it had a hole in it when it arrived.  It's also cheap quality.  Returning."
1.0,Size up on this shirt! Runs very small!
1.0,Cheap and useless.  Could not get a single one of the earrings to unclasp in order to wear.
1.0,"I read reviews saying these are snug and stay up.  That couldn't be farther from the truth.  They do not stay up on calf whatsoever.  The first pair ripped as soon as I put it on, so I sent them back."
1.0,I disliked that they product did not work. I charged it as it instructions and nothing happened. Just through away my money. By the way it took for ever to arrive. It was a birthday present.
1.0,In Marh I got my new strap. The first one edures 18 months. This new one is almost broken before three monts of use. Pretty bad product. I would not consider buyin it any more.
1.0,"I really liked the concept of this product, but the smell was overwhelming.  I had to return them because of the smell.  If the manufacturer could fix that problem, this case would be perfect."
1.0,Quality is very similar to the cheap Smoky Bear badges and the tin stars given away free for the fans of The lone Ranger. The product is less than 1% in quality as represented by the picture.
1.0,"Flimsy. ""Merry Christmas"" lettering color is orange...not red...does not look christmassy."
1.0,"Though the shirt is pretty, and the color was nice, the material was very flimsy.  Not something that would hold its shape and probably wear out quickly.  Not good for activities."
1.0,Poor quality. Feels like a glove to clean the toilet with..I don't like it at all. For the money I paid I expected more
1.0,"Going to change the battery to see if that resolves the problem. If not, I’m going to be VERY ANGRY.?"
1.0,Incredibly cheap material. Color scheme is not good at all. Definitely not worth $10. Don't get this. Get a surplus Swiss Army poncho.
1.0,"In less than a week, the ring discolored and it stained my skin. I’m dissatisfied and disappointed that I wasted money on this item."
1.0,bought 8/9 and the foot kept falling out of heel. we are returning
1.0,It ripped very easily
1.0,Watch had a huge logo in front... wrong watch was mailed highly disaapointed with this watch. The band is cheap asf and hard to latch into the whole..... no bueno do not buy this watch
1.0,They don't seem authentic
1.0,Not what was described
1.0,The strap around the shoulder didnt sit well. It came up too high under the armpit. Not adjustable
1.0,"It all tangled and the little rings keep opening. The make, finishing and quality is not at all good. Very disappointed"
1.0,I bought a size 12/13 year old and it is more like a 5/6! My daughter needed this set for pajama day at school. Need to say I have to go and buy something else. Will be returning
1.0,I was surprised when I unboxed this shirt. It was nothing like the photos. This shirt’s material looked cheap and the stitching looked flimsy. I returned it and the seller asked if I would re-sell it so they didn’t have to pay for shipping. I chose to send it back and get a refund.
1.0,They're cheap looking and the quality is not good.
1.0,doesnt stick
1.0,The pearls are Not even big and small
1.0,This dress was nothing like the picture.
1.0,The septum is currently stuck in my nose. Cheap and dangerous. The hinge is locked and I can’t open it. I’ve had my septum pierced for 10 years and never had this happen to my jewelry. Now I have to wait for the local tattoo & piercing shop to open to get it removed.
1.0,Do not waste your money on this. All night long I was fighting this from rising up and in all the pictures you can see it bunching up
1.0,Says no piercing needed however that is not true it has a post not at all what I wanted
1.0,very easy to bend and crack the whole shoe.
1.0,Poor quality. Wristband would not adjust at all.
1.0,Was not pleased with the quality the charm is plated and caused an allergic reaction definitely wasn't the proper material as described
1.0,"The hat is pretty, but super thin and the construction and stitch work leave a lot to be desired. The Pom fell off and it isn’t very warm. Very disappointed. I expected a better quality for the price."
1.0,"I’m petite, 5 ft and 115 pounds and XS size is way to tight, even the small size is and the fit of the costume is supposed to be loose and not fitted. It is not accurate to suggest buying o e size up, it should be at least 2. I can’t believe it is not eligible for return when the size is completely off"
1.0,They fall off pretty easily. My kid lost her bracelet in the lake while she was In a canoe at day camp. Bye bye air tag.
1.0,Broke the second my daughter tried putting it on.
1.0,"Poor quality product. Material is cheap and stiff, came wrinkled and stayed that way. Does not look like it does on the model in the pictures. Ordered a small but feels closer to a medium."
1.0,"Definitely not standard US sizing, I ordered a size xxl and it fit more like a large. Doesn’t look anything like the dress pictured, buttons aren’t real and has elastic in the sleeves and skirt ruffle. Honestly it looked like a hospital gown! So dissapointed!"
1.0,"Cheap product.  Poor engineering/manufacturing.  The tip is wider than the opening of the buckle!! So, one has to turn the tip sideways to get it into the buckle.  I would not buy again.  Substandard."
1.0,Both myself & my 2 sisters tried this dress on. We are all different body shapes but close in size.  This dress is just made wrong & not like the picture. The “pockets” are sewn wrong so that they just stick out & makes it look like you’re wearing a sideways potato sack.<br />It was good for some laughter though. Considering gifting it just so I can laugh with friends when they try it on.
1.0,"This dress is absolutely horrible! The fabric is bad, the cut is wrong, and it looks absolutely cheap! Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,Item fits perfect on 8 year old. Unfortunately I couldn’t even put it on by sliding it over hand or putting clasp on around my wrist.
1.0,"bottom is too large, but top is too small. bra pads are thicker than necessary."
1.0,The bracelets were terrible. It is as if someone went to a pile of rejects and sent them to you. It appears as though no thought was given to the selection.
1.0,these earrings look great on the website model - they do not stay on your earlobe like the picture shows
1.0,The color is more brick red then brown
1.0,This product is very thin and looks cheap.  Would not recommend.
1.0,I ordered a women’s 2x... the dress could fit a teenager (size medium) it was cute but not a women’s 2x... do not order if your expecting to get a women’s  size dress
1.0,Unfortunately the butterfly prints do know flow with the compression and they cause constriction where each butterfly is at. These were a nightmare trying to roll up past my ankle. I do not have cankles. I have purchased other nurse mates socks and didn’t have this problem
1.0,Received (3) incorrect pairs
1.0,"After wearing them for a total of 10 times, the cashmere lining starting to fall apart."
1.0,"the item is too big, nothing a normal man would wear."
1.0,"I have a regular pair of pajama jeans extra large and they fit perfectly- I'm under 5'5&#34; and they are not too long or anything. I purchased these with the expectation that they would fit basically the same - not only are they too large, they are made for someone who is at least 6 feet tall. Not at all happy with my purchase"
1.0,I’m returning it was way too smart
1.0,"Tried two shirts in two sizes, larger than I normally wear.  Had to return them both.  I'm a tall slender woman and I'm not sure what type of figure these shirts are designed for."
1.0,"Just a heavy and uncomfortable ""wife-beater"" type shirt. Not gonna do much other than muffin the little bit of fat you're trying to hide, lol."
1.0,To tight and hurt more than help
1.0,Second time trying to order these. First time they said they were lost and this time the package had been opened.
1.0,sizing is off! not even close to what is published. too small!!
1.0,Not at all what expected. Very disappointed
1.0,"While the chain and the snap button were yellow gold as advertised, the lanyard piece was more of a muted rose gold. So the overall look was very offputting and not usable when wearing other yellow gold jewelry."
1.0,"The soles are really hard. I prefer my slippers to be soft and squishy. If you like hard, rigid slippers then these are for you."
1.0,"Purchased this product specifically for use with dress clothing. Fasteners would constantly lose their grip on my shirts and socks, even when the shirt stays were given plenty of slack. The set was ruined when both of the shirt clips on one of the stays slid off my shirt, down my pant leg, and under my shoe as I was walking. This product might work for thicker shirts/socks, but absolutely did not work with standard dress shirts and dress socks."
1.0,The material looks thicker than description
1.0,It says it's stretchy in the reviews. It's not. It's a stiff horrible meterial with a cheap zipper on the back.
1.0,All button fell off! Lost & missing buttons. Poor quality
1.0,"I have a couple of Maggie Tang tops that I love, but this one is very poorly constructed. Doesn't stay in place at all."
1.0,"Pretty, silver, but they don't all open."
1.0,Broke in 2 weeks.
1.0,Half of the lites stripes did not light up at all! The groom and I got them for fun at his wedding and neither set we bought lit up right! Half of the strips were dark and white with no color at all! Very disappointing I even got a replacement set the day before the wedding and they were the same!
1.0,It was missing one of the earrings when I got these. I just opened them last night to wrap them and found just one earring.
1.0,Too small.  I am going to return it. Not a good value for the money.
1.0,These were the right shape but too big for my Rx glasses.
1.0,Chicas esa blusa es demasiada pequeña es de buena calidad pero no me sirvio soy talla M y corre como una talla Small
1.0,Dress was sheer see thru fabric and didn’t fit correctly. I need return instructions.
1.0,"Oversized, does not work."
1.0,Not true to size.  Cheap looking.
1.0,These things are really small!
1.0,Love the look but the quality was very poor. First time wearing the item and one of the metal rings broken and the leather cord snapped. Very flimsily put together.
1.0,"Yikes, this thing was like a parachute on me. The material is REALLY thin, including the plaid sleeves and neck, and isn't nearly as warm and comfy as it appears in the picture. Overall a pretty ill fitting and cheaply made shirt."
1.0,"They look cute but honestly, the worst purchase I've ever made.  But then again they were only a few dollars.  They truly cannot be worn as they feel like they are made of cardboard with sheer plastic soles.  Not even worth theropod to the post office to return them.  Super disappointed  If anyone does purchase ... They do run at least a full size larger than your true size."
1.0,"DO NOT buy this product, especially if the weather you're using it for has any sort of wind. I used this for the first time today and the second there was a hint of wind it flipped inside out and broke!"
1.0,Broke when received poor craftsman ship
1.0,Cheaply made. Watch not water proof. Trash is where it's at currently.
1.0,"I have never had a card case, so I thought I would have gotten some type of instructions. I can not give you a review at this time."
1.0,Awful<br />&<br />Ripped so its now in the trash !
1.0,THIS HAT STINKS SOOO VERY BAD. CAN NOT EVEN WEAR IT. SOOO DISSATISFIED......WASTED MONEY......
1.0,Horrible. Fell apart right out of the package.
1.0,"Quality control must be terrible on these. I see other reviewers saying the bands were too narrow, but mine was 24mm across. Obviously it did NOT fit on any of my 22mm lug watches, so I sent it back.<br />Would not recommend."
1.0,I did not like the fit of this dress and the material is of poor quality. The color is not as pictured and the placement of the horizontal pattern is very unflattering. Unfortunately I’m having difficulty locating a return request for this item and will have to contact Amazon.
1.0,"These lights did not come with any instructions at all. Thus, best guess installation turned out to be incorrect and I had an upset kid on Christmas."
1.0,Not a 3x
1.0,"The zipper was impractical, the quality was horrible.  Adding to the longer delivery time, they were also much smaller than expected.  Garbage."
1.0,Very cute ordered size 9-10 for daughter not<br />Even close . It was more like 5-6T.
1.0,Badddd
1.0,"Horrible quality, looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,Very disappointed! Although the sweatshirt fits the colors and the picture quality are poor. The pictures of Godzilla and Kong are blurry as is the font!. Very disappointed and a waste of money. I got the second style. Still considering returning the item.
1.0,I hoped for heavier knit sweater.
1.0,"I did not receive a hoodie, rather footie pajamas 👎"
1.0,really really small for xxl - might fit an size 2 but never an extra large
1.0,I ordered the largest size and it was still snug.<br />~Jen
1.0,"too small, tried submitting for a refund and did not have that option."
1.0,Picture and description was accurate but it arrived severely tarnished in several areas.  I was so disappointed because it looked very unique and would compliment a nice outfit.  Not this time!!!!
1.0,It was broken by the time we got it. My dad used pliers to fix them.
1.0,Please don't trade these at Disneyland parks. Looking at these pins I can see they may be counterfeit and it is not fair to others that you will be trading  with people who have legitimate pins. People spend good money on quality pins and just to save a few bucks you are cheating others. This may also change the rules Disneyland has for trading. They do have a way to test for counterfeits.
1.0,It broke when we took it out of the package. What a waste of money!
1.0,The review below sold me on this belt. This belt is not like that review. It fell apart in just a couple wears.  The red peeled off. Granted it's less then $10
1.0,The material I don’t like
1.0,"No good, broke after a year."
1.0,Not like the one the model is wearing. Yuck.
1.0,To small. I ordered a X large. Chinese sizes are different from American sizes. They wanted me to pay to send back to China. They would not refund me/
1.0,"The bar is so small, and the opening is way too tiny to use. It's literally like they were made for a child!"
1.0,"I barely took these out of the package when I saw some blue gunk stuck to the mirror part of one of the earrings. It looks like plastic or something, like the beads, but I have no idea how it got stuck to the mirror or how to get it off! It bothers me enough that I'll very likely be returning these (even my husband noticed and I didn't tell him about it), and I'm not sure yet if it's worth trying to order another pair since the hook also looks tricky. I love the design so I'm very upset right now."
1.0,Metal turned immediately.  Returned it.
1.0,"POORLY CONSTRUCTED LONG  GRANNY PANTIES, VERY CHEAPIE MATERIAL, FIRST THEY DIDNT SHOW UP, NOW THEY SENT A REPLACEMENT, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. RETURNED ITEM , HAD TO CALL 10 TIMES , FURTHER WASTING MY TIME TO GET THE REFUND FOR ITEMS RETURNED, LAME"
1.0,I didn't like the fabric
1.0,Really cute but broke the first day
1.0,"I wouldn’t even give this product a 1 star...that’s how poorly made they are. I literally took them out of the bag they came in for the first time...tried attaching them to the squat bar, they clamped down so tight, the one snapped IMMEDIATELY...broke into 5 pieces. Thought something was wrong, asked a fellow lifter to check them out, we put the other one on a different bar, same size....snapped into 2 pieces. Completely junk. In my opinion."
1.0,2 of the beads fell off as I was opening box and they where bent!!
1.0,They already change colors
1.0,Pure junk. Amazon should not allow this sort of garbage to be sold!
1.0,"Impossible to wear. My head is no bigger than average, but it's too big for these overtight, too-painful-to-wear sunglasses."
1.0,Did not match the rose gold of my watch
1.0,I thought this would be a good idea for carrying my sunglasses and readers in the same pouch. The snap came off in less than a week. I used E6000 glue to re-attach and that failed after a while. It's not secure to carry expensive prescription glasses this way. I bought something else with a zipper closure
1.0,"I ordered 4 pair of these to give as gifts, WAY before Christmas. Well they didn’t arrive in time and thank goodness I didn’t depend on them because they are hideously ugly. They are HUGE and heavy and about as big as your entire ear, like having a snow globe on your ear. I’m trying to figure out how to incorporate them into a craft project."
1.0,These gloves developed a hole in the finger on the very first use.  I was hauling yard materials in my wheel barrow. .  They were a gift from my wife.  It's too bad because they fit perfectly.  I suspect it's a faulty stitch as you might surmise from the picture.  I wish I knew how to contact the company about this defect.
1.0,"This would be a good helmet and a great value if they could get the liners in straight! The helmet is light weight and the added ear protection was just what I was looking for. However, as soon as I put it on, I knew it was crooked. Sorry I did not take a photo before I returned it. I had read other reviews with this issue but was hoping for the best and I might get lucky, I guess you get what you pay for?"
1.0,"The watch I ordered was similar in that it had a Khaki strap and blue dial, but was a nicer shade of blue, PLUS the dial of the watch I received is one of the ugliest color/pattern designs I've ever seen!  About half the dial is blue but the rest is this gold & white zig-zag shape reminiscent of a bad acid trip...which also makes it very difficult to read the time when the minute/hour hands are over that section. Yuck. Plus, the bezel around the outside of the crystal is such a dark blue (navy blue plus!) it almost looks black, just not a good complimentary color to the blue elsewhere on the face. I thought I had returned it a while ago, but just discovered it under some paperwork in my office...now that it's too late to return/exchange it. Anyway, I would not recommend this one folks, looks chessy in the listing, and even worse in person.  It'll be a good X-MAS gift to one of my LEAST-favorite in-laws."
1.0,Bought XXL and these shirts are straight crop tops. Super thin material. Not worth the money.
1.0,The clasp on the bag wasn’t able to close from the beginning
1.0,"I love the flowing Boho look and have several tunic tops that I adore, but this one was beyond ridiculous. I ordered my usual size Medium, but it was enormous."
1.0,chord was already broken in package only 1 sided damn near flat do not buy
1.0,"THE PICTURE ONLINE IS NOT WHAT COMES ON THE FRONT!  It came with a small picture of waves NOT the words stay groovy as pictured. I'm returning it, disappointed. The size was as advertised."
1.0,Horrible! Couldn't get it to work and even my jeweler said it was not put together well
1.0,"LOVED the material.  Ordered a L.  I'm 5'3"", 160 lbs but this cut is way to small in the chest.  If I ordered an up size for the chest area, it would bag everywhere else.  Super cute dress and style, just not in proportion correctly."
1.0,extremely pissed! $17 bucks for a pair of pants that came with a huge hole in the side seam!!!
1.0,Need to make this in a class 3!
1.0,just rcvd dress. it has no tags and smells heavily of womens PERFUME.... so disappointed
1.0,Too itchy to wear. Washed it and it didn't soften. No way is the 100% cotton. This is made of something else. Feel like paper and makes a crinkle sound. Do not recommend.
1.0,"The dress does NOT look like the picture.  The flowers are flat and the bow is much bigger than pictured.  Not only is the bow huge, it covers the whole front IF you take time to sew the top of the bow to the dress, otherwise it would flop around.<br /><br />Cheap, cheap, cheap!"
1.0,The box material is fine BUT it doesn't really stay together at all. fine if you don't mind taping it together.
1.0,Watch did not come with a back on it and the batteries were rusted and had battery acid on it. Unfortunately the kid already threw the box away so can't replace it.
1.0,After one more it constantly sheds.
1.0,"The pendant and chain looked far larger on the website than it turned out to be.  Also, the stone did not have the attractive color striations shown on the website.  I would never wear this necklace nor could I imagine giving it to anyone because it is quite unattractive and cheap looking.  I would return it, but it's just not worth the effort."
1.0,Ripped apart in one use. So sad :/
1.0,This item was purchased as a birthday gift the design on the top looks like it’s an iron on was not straight the shorts I thought would be more of spandex material... I ordered small but it looks like a medium... will not purchase again
1.0,runs to small.
1.0,"It broke within a half hour of my wearing it. Wahhhh. I LOVE the way it looked, but if it breaks that easily it doesn't matter how pretty it is! Beads EVERYWHERE. And nothing even happened to put stress on the chain. I was just adjusting the fasteners on the arms of my glasses and SNAP! So, maybe you'll have better luck, but I won't order this again."
1.0,This dress tore after one wash. The material is horrible.  I would not recommend for purchase.
1.0,Way too small and I wanted the extra large and they didn’t have it
1.0,Demasiado pequeños y el color es muy transparente en los aretes de nariz no los volveria a comprar
1.0,Crystals fell out before I ever opened the package and wont stay in. Don't waste your money. They are pretty but that is it. Pretty on the counter wont let you wear them.
1.0,"This does not fit the Flak 2.0. The lenses are thinner than the original lenses and there is a gap in the upper corners. The lenses rattle around in the frame and pop out easily. This is our 4th seller we've tried finding Flak 2.0 replacement lenses through and it seems they all come from the same factory and they all do not fit the Flak 2.0 frames. Different packaging for each seller we've ordered from, exact same fit between all of them. Dynamix, Walleva, Okaynis.. all do not fit."
1.0,"High quality bag, thick zippers and pockets that will stand up to daily abuse. Would recommend.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Broke after a roughly two weeks. Straps just failed and bag fell apart with average use. BUYER BEWARE."
1.0,"This product is super big, does not fit at all."
1.0,Turned colors after wearing once
1.0,It doesn't fit. I got an 8 and it fits more like a 6. I didn't think this would be so tight. Maybe it's just this ring I ordered.<br /><br />Update: I dropped it and it chipped/dented. Just a failure all around.
1.0,Not accuate sizing. And for feminist saying; yet a smaller than small saying.....SHAME ON YOU.
1.0,This dress is made out of 100% polyester. Further more it has no label explaining the fabric contents meaning technically this should NOT be sold in the United States.<br /><br />The quality of this item was something I would expect from a cheap knock-off site like wish or ali baba.
1.0,"Too bulkey, I like that there are lots of pockets but the walls in between these pockets make the bag too bulkey so there is not much space left for ALL the things you have to carry for a baby. Do yourself a favor and get just one big hang bag. That's what I used now while this bag is just sitting there collecting dust. I was a brand new mom and wanted to best products out there. Now a now that it is better to get used or cheap because babies grow WAY too fast, you barely use anything and end up paying too much: this bag."
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  Delivered on time with one side so bent out guarantee should have been noticed upon tossing it in the bubbled shipping envelope.  The lens are muuuuch bigger than you would think (about the size of a bottom 12oz beer bottle, which I will be drinking then using to smash these glasses).  Not even to be used as outfit prop. If I could give them a zero I would."
1.0,Doesn't glow in the dark.
1.0,Terrible material & very unflattering. I literally threw this dress in the trash.
1.0,These hurt my ears. Gave them away.
1.0,If you are really short or a kid then this might work for you. I’m 5’10” and it was basically a little longer than a tshirt and didn’t even cover my butt.
1.0,This looks extra long and very full. Barely comes to your waist once wrapped around your neck. It is rectangular shaped.<br /> Nice fabric though
1.0,You get two but they are both for the right ear and the clip doesn't hold.
1.0,these socks look like mens socks because they are all dark stripes .  also the colors seem muddy  and probably won't match anything I wear.  i assumed the selection would be similar to the photo
1.0,Stinks so bad! It made my hair smell like fish oil! Had the oddest smell. Can't even use it. Was really cute too.
1.0,Not very ‘hardy’. I’m a huge Marmot fan but for the price this isn’t worth it. Snags super easy and won’t last more than one season if worn regularly
1.0,Doesn’t look like the picture!!!!
1.0,"These bands are long, the overlap was so much that the tail of the band stuck out and made them unwearable. they also don't look good with the larger 42mm watch."
1.0,"This wallet is bulky, it's falling apart after daily use for a couple of months. The bottom is actually coming off in pieces and soon the contents of the main pockets are going to begin falling out of the bottom. Now what really annoys me about this wallet is that it's bulky, yet my business cards (which are of normal size, not large by any means) don't fit in the designated pockets. My credit cards do, but not my business cards, so they have to go into the money pouch. This is a bulky and flimsy wallet. I wish I hadn't bought it.<br /><br />Another update 2 more months down the road. I hate this wallet and replaced it with a $9 alpine swiss wallet that is doing the job so much better. This wallet is genuinely terrible and I would highly suggest not buying it."
1.0,Was to small for my watch
1.0,Stretchy material cheap dress
1.0,Sleeves too short. Fabric rough
1.0,Ordered my size and it came way too small. Had to return it because it’s 100% completely see through. Not what I was looking for.
1.0,Glasses broke on same day. Screw came out. Very light in weight. Kept falling off my face.
1.0,"This is the second model by this company I have owned. The first stopped working after only a few months, and fortunately I was able to warranty it. Its replacement lasted only a few more, and I was hoping the newer model would hold up a little better.<br /><br />After about 4 months, this device has also stopped working, and customer support has not responded in over 5 days. Unless you absolutely need the shock feature, invest in something else."
1.0,"Despite reading the reviews and ordering the recommended size, this shirt was tiny.  It's also a horrible fabric and feels very cheap."
1.0,Too small and they slip out of your feet as you walk.
1.0,I ordered this for myself in XXL.  Fits like an L.  Looks great on my son though.  Be aware that this fits 2 sizes small.  Maybe Chinese size scale?
1.0,these shoes were used and T don't wear used shoes but I WOULD LIKE A PAIR OF NEW ONES
1.0,The top and bottom shades do not match.
1.0,"I returned it, the fit at the hip was too small, the fit was really weird on the body, the stitching is below quality and the material looks and feels cheap"
1.0,I received these earring today. I ordered them for my 2 1/2 year old who keeps taking her earrings off. I was expecting them to be screws on backs but they aren’t.
1.0,It fits too loose on frame.
1.0,Thin and flat as a pancake!!!!  Sent it back.
1.0,"So small, no stretch"
1.0,I would not recommend buying this outfit. I bought for my 5 year old. The top was way too big would fit an 8 year old. The shorts were way too small would have fit a 3 year old. The material was awful and see through. Best part about the outfit was the little pink flower that is detachable.
1.0,Very difficult to replace the band. Comes with a straight pin and a tool and not the standard easy use pins that come with most bands. I tried for 4 minutes and gave up. Have never actually used the band since I could not get it on.
1.0,Much smaller than expected. Size up 3 to 4 sizes.
1.0,While the jacket was exactly what I wanted.it was truly made for someone with a petite frame. A very very small frame.
1.0,"This came broken. Followed directions, shake and also manually turning the crown. It stops after a few seconds. Totally cheap and unreliable."
1.0,These tarnished almost immediately after opening the package
1.0,"crappy, don't waste your money"
1.0,Pockets are useless
1.0,Horrible sewing job.  The left side is sewn so crooked that it sticks out at least 2” from the dress.
1.0,The dress was NOT white.  I wanted it for the color.  I was looking for a pretty white dress.  It is off white.  Returned for a refund.
1.0,"This NOT boys sizing. A grown man can wear them. So, I gave them to my husband."
1.0,"Horrible quality, don’t waste your money on this item"
1.0,This is not a hoodie sweatshirt.  It is a long-sleeved hooded shirt.  Sweatshirt involves being sweatshirt material.  This is not. Had it not had a hood and had a normal shirt neckline this would be wearable as an every day shirt for me.  But I ONLY wear hoodies to keep warm when its cold out.  This is too light weight for that
1.0,Broke 2 days after using it... waste of money!
1.0,Dont waste your money Ebay has better and cheaper
1.0,"Way too small to be effective. but if you are looking for a chin strap, this might work"
1.0,Its about 2 sizes to big for me... I ordered my size but way to large around the bust area!
1.0,No support...not what expected
1.0,misleading advertising<br />in the product description says the package brings five and I only got one
1.0,"cheap, easy breakable, not worth the money do not order"
1.0,This broke almost right away
1.0,Looks very cheap shows every cellulite on your body and it is very small. Concept or idea is great but fabric is cheap
1.0,EXTREMELY SMALL for the size given!!
1.0,"didn’t clean up well after making, revived it dirty and had to deep clean the edges"
1.0,"These are the most unflattering pants I've tried on in a long time. The legs are cut skinny and narrow and fit more like a pair of leggings but they have a looser almost baggy fit through the hips and waist so you wind up with all this extra material that just poofs out. The waistband is also very strange and the extra material just makes you look wider than you really are. The drawstring through the outer waistband is more like a shoe string and is completely unecesary. If you cinch the waist and tie it tighter, you wind up with a paperbag look which went out in the 1980s. The reflective material that lines the front pockets is also a wasted design. In order to see the tape or take advantage of its reflective properties, you'd have to be wearing a short or cropped shirt and considering the style of these pants, thats very unlikely. I was hoping that these would have a more loose and relaxed fit and be a comfortable alternative to leggings or sweatpants, but they're not -- they're just a pair of pants I'd NEVER want to be seen wearing in public!"
1.0,"The fabric isn't what I wanted or expected, but to return them, they wanted almost $5.00!"
1.0,"Simply way too small, despite being same size as other dresses from this seller that fit perfectly."
1.0,"Zero stars. These arrived with one arm completely bent, AND they feel incredibly cheap even if they weren't defective. Don't waste your time."
1.0,"Came with a nice big hole in the back, which is pretty upsetting."
1.0,Very disappointed about this products size chart
1.0,Too big for face
1.0,Has a small tear in the shoe but want have a Christmas gift for my mom if I send back right now
1.0,Looks no where near the picture.  Picture shows a low cut top and the one we received was not at all low cut.  Shipping cost to return makes it not worth returning.  Wish they would at least have an accurate picture.
1.0,The clasp broke as soon as I removed it from the package. It did not slide into the Apple Watch as it should. I was able to eventually side it in however the metal tab had broken and that could not be remedied.
1.0,Not Good too Big
1.0,This necklace was worn twice and broke apart where the leather is connected to the chain.  This is ridiculous!  You had better ship a new one immediately!  Thank you!
1.0,Haven’t had any issues over the passed few years. But my last two orders were way to small. I orders 6g and got 8g twice. I think they measured the outer edge as the 6g this time instead of the saddle.
1.0,"I had to completely disassemble this dress and reassemble before my daughter could wear this. There were unfinished seams, loose threads, and the overlay on the skirt was falling apart. Overall, this dress was poorly made. We would have returned it had it not been in such close proximity to the occasion it was bought for. Luckily, I am a seamstress and was able to make it work, but I would not recommend this dress. It was such a shame because it really should have been a beautiful dress if done correctly, and was AFTER I made several repairs, but the condition it arrived in was shameful to say the least."
1.0,I bought 3 belts from this seller. The first one became my favorite belt. The 2 others all brown were unusable as you can't put a hole in these. They should not sell these.  Buy at your own risk.
1.0,"One of the clock hands broke in less than two months of normal use. Very cheaply made, would not reccommend."
1.0,buyer beware. this is cheap and totally overpriced
1.0,Wayyy to small!!<br />If you've got big boobs (size 34 c ) don't bother to waste your money
1.0,Does not work
1.0,"Changed my review from a 5 star to a 1 star. I take excellent care of my sunglasses. While initially I loved the fit and look, they quickly started falling apart. The decal rubbed off, they became loose, and the arms became wobbly. Eventually the screws came so loose, nothing could be done to repair them. Betsey Johnson products are made much better than this. These must have been a knock-off and I have been duped. Don't fall for the scam."
1.0,The stone that I received had variety little variance unlike the photos.
1.0,Looks like a D instead of a G
1.0,Valero on strap sewed upside down/backwards. Would have had to twist strap to secure.
1.0,"Very cheap material, expected a little more"
1.0,Absolutely a complete rip-off.  You've seen the commercial with the lady threading a needle.  Impossible!!!!  You can't walk without taking them off.  You can't tell where you going!
1.0,Extremely small. I’m a 36DD and this is way closer to a C cup even though it’s an XL. Back band is ridiculously small fit more like a medium. I am really disappointed the sizing was so off because I loved this style of bathing suit.
1.0,I really liked the charm because it is inspirational however; right after I put it on my sterling silver charm bracelet it started to turn. Beware of &#34;silver plated&#34; because it will not hold up. I am really disappointed because I really wanted to keep it on the bracelet. Not worth my time or money to try and send it back. Not worth the purchase.
1.0,"I purchased these boots for an east coast vacation and after wearing one time the leather wrapped heel started peeling. Unfortunately I packed lightly and had no back up boots and had to wear the defective pair for two weeks. I had selected the Franco Sartos because they were leather, but I now regret that choice."
1.0,"These are not 12mm. They are 11mm. As far as the quality of the product, they're just fine. But if you WANT 12, don't order here."
1.0,Very poorly made. Tried to put one on and the ear piece broke immediately. The sewing looks like a child did it. I do not recommend this product at all. I bought two boxes and I am so disappointed.
1.0,Not what at all is pictured!<br />Falls apart!<br />I understand why now the seller has a NO return policy!<br />BS!
1.0,"When I receive this watch it was packaged very nicely with a pillow in between equality looks very good, I gave it to my girlfriend and hands and face fell off.  We like to watch but it’s obviously not made very well."
1.0,This top was super super small. And I was unable to return it!!! The local resale shop did not even want it.
1.0,The material bad but the size awesome<br />You can see true it
1.0,I opened the package and both earrings have broken string. Didn’t even get to wear them. Such a bummer. Now I have to drive 20 mins just to return them at an Amazon return spot or mail them back. Ugh.
1.0,It’s itchy. I returned it.
1.0,"They came and immediately a perfume smell filled the room and clung to every thing the dresses touched. They stink so bad I can't wear them, I washed multiple times to try and get the smell out, nope that didn't work. I got them for such a discounted price that I was so excited until they came and were unusable. Very disappointed  I do not plan to order from this ""organic"" company again...the odor they embodied was so chemical smelling I have to doubt they ""organic"" label."
1.0,"Hate it. It looks and feels like a slip or night gown. Needed it for a funeral so upset now I have to rush to find another dress, guess that's what I get for buying online"
1.0,"Great concept but difficult to put on, even after watching the video."
1.0,I did not like these. It looked like it was apart of a cows costume.
1.0,Garbage. When you put on it smashes your face..waste of money.
1.0,"This dress is so ugly ,it fits like a tent i ordered a 16 but should have ordered a 12 i hate this dress"
1.0,"First time in my 'AMAZON HISTORY'.<br />A product that totally sucked!<br /><br />Packaging was perfect but the item inside was Full of horrible scratches, I threw it away!<br />Not Happy!!!"
1.0,This was sewn completely weird and wasn’t even wearable.
1.0,"The fringe feel apart while I was wearing it and when I washed it as directed, the fringe completely unraveled....poor quality! Don't buy it!"
1.0,"Pin does not fit into clasp and bends easily. It looks nice, perfect size, but doesn't work."
1.0,Not much good things to say about it the third shed a lot after wearing it one day the chain broke it's way smaller than I expected the beak was not sew down like it shows in the  picture the fur covered up with eyeballs you couldn't see that it had eyes it's just very cheap and not worth anything so I sent it back
1.0,Broke after the first time I wore it.
1.0,Super disappointed with the product.. it’s cheap and just plain ugly. I missed the return window on this and bummed
1.0,This jewelry is s***. I do want a refund because I bought this ring for a music festival and didn't even get to wear it because when I put it in the bar wasn't long enough to reach all the way through the hole of my piercing so it could not click. It's also so crooked that it wouldn't have sat right in my nose. Second of all is very poorly made. Doesn't even look like a real piece of jewelry. Then the bar fell out when I picked it up again to take a picture!!
1.0,Everything about the dress says cheap and carelessness. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"Grand Seiko's are made of Titanium, NOT stainless steel."
1.0,"Really small + poor quality, thin material."
1.0,"Very poorly made, comes huge, red &#34;leather&#34; section comes with the cheapest alligator texture, and of course the red is closer to a dark burgundy than true red. No where near worth $10 gonna spend about a week re-shaping and color correcting these just to make them usable."
1.0,I have another blouse same brand and 2x is larger than this. I should have gotten the 3x.
1.0,Wire was so thick I could not get them in my ears.
1.0,The band was way too long!!  I think it might fit my dog. Unusable and no returns. Buyer beware!
1.0,Leather in toe area was bunched up. Too big
1.0,Not cute. Has no shape to it. I don’t know what sizes they make their clothes in because it’s definitely not what I ordered
1.0,Bruh i didn’t get what was discribed
1.0,It’s wayyyyy bigger than an actual septum piercing so it looks ridiculous and the magnets do not hold that well
1.0,Bowman was poorly glued on so it came off. Haven't used it since the first time.
1.0,Great options if i could get them to work.  The wristband to small and very uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,DO NOT order!!! It looks nothing like the picture- it’s cheap feeling and looking in person! Just awful! Waste of money!!
1.0,Ordered twice and both time the black was faded on the white.  Poor color quality
1.0,I received a different purse entirely. I will be returning it.
1.0,"This must be child size,  I ordered a large and way way to small. Will give it away. Will not but again."
1.0,This shirt is beautiful and the fabric is great but the size is extremely small for the fit. It's almost 2 sizes too small if not three.
1.0,"It arrived damaged. The silver accessories that hang were in pieces, off the top"
1.0,"This design is a cheap stollen/rip off version of the larger and better quality hard enamel pin design by 0liminalcraft0 on etsy.<br /><br />The real design is hard enamel, has a double post style backing and is an inch larger.<br /><br />Do not support theft."
1.0,I'm dissatisfied with this product..the details days touch screen and its the button at the side I have  to be pressing  for it to work ive been pressing the screen like crazy I need back my refund
1.0,"Super cheap thin fabric. The fur on the lion’s mane is matted and gross. There were already holes in the seems, one right at the lower abdomen and one on the back. I’ve never returned something so quickly in my life!"
1.0,It was XXL that fit like a mens med. Couldn't even put it on.
1.0,Orders like a xxxl still fit small
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:289955cda1b4f9b45e381b009ebb7215]] My second pair now.  Arm broke in half on first pair.  Glued and arm broke again in different place!  Love the look, but very cheaply made."
1.0,"Ordered Red and got burgundy. Several stock photos for the red dress but that's not the color you get. Material is very thin and cheap, loose threads, bad stitching, it's not an expensive dress but I WAY overpaid. Looks like something you would buy at the dollar tree. Returning immediately."
1.0,This was not what was expecting. Wouldn't recommend this item to anyone.  Came quickly just not happy with my purchase.
1.0,Too shiny for me
1.0,Had bag for a little over a month and zipper broke.
1.0,"Dont buy, not the correct clasp or chain came with my item. I received some necklace with some long piece of black plastic that was supposedly a ""chain"". Then to top it all off, the clasp is some snap in assortment, and broke off the first day I wore it, TO SCHOOL. You know, where all you do is sit.<br /><br />I wouldn't dare wear it to the gym.<br /><br />Tl;dr FAILLLLLLL"
1.0,"would not recommend, the ring is adjustable but for a childs finger, the bracelet and extension are adult sized. Not happy with it."
1.0,"Very small and weird fit. I am a large busted lady and was excited when reading all the reviews however was quite disappointed even though I ordered quite a bit larger than my size. The fit is very tight the bust was awkward at best. And promptly returning them. I am normally a 38 f and I ordered a 40 g well I could hook it together it was quite tight and very uncomfortable and the cups seemed to extend in a strange v outward, there was no support and seemed loose in the cups"
1.0,You get what you pay for. They dont fit right. The shoes are too narrow at the toes.
1.0,Poor quality and not as advertised.
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap and huge frames.  How they get away with calling them optical quality is beyond me."
1.0,This is terrible it don't fit properly
1.0,Sent back ! The material was nothing like it said it would be . Very misleading on how it was advertised!
1.0,Overall it’s okay. But I only got the hat and there is no shield for face.....
1.0,"PURCHASED THIS DRESS FOR A RECENT TRIP TO PUNTA CANA, WHERE THE HOTEL WAS GOING TO BE HOSTING A WHITE PARTY. WHEN THE DRESS ARRIVED IT LOOKED A BIT FRUMPY BUT SINCE I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TRY IT ON I DECIDED TO TAKE IT ON MY TRIP ANYWAYS. ONCE THEIR I TRIED ON THE DRESS AND NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT FLATTERING BUT THE MATERIAL WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  THE TOP WAS ITCHY AND FELT ALMOST PLASTIC. MOST DEFINITELY WILL BE RETURNING THIS DRESS."
1.0,These shirts all run the gamut of radical sizing differences.  THIS SHIRT RUNS VERY VERY SMALL.
1.0,"I didn't like how it felt on my head, where it connects to the glasses."
1.0,"I bought a small in white. This product fit poorly, and was clearly made of poor material. The waist was very wide compared to the photo. The fabric was incredibly sheer and thin. The skirt was nothing like the photo, unpleated and wrinkled, and the top was flimsy at best. I'm very disappointed in this product, and will return it."
1.0,This item arrives with brown smudgy stains all over the front! So annoyed.
1.0,This blouse was too small. Could not return it . So gave it to a friend’s child. Sorry it was a bad purchase on my part.
1.0,The image matches four that I have.  The description indicates they are made of 100% cotton.  The description also says they are spandex.  I wanted cotton....I received spandex.  Not good.
1.0,Cheap junk. Will be returning. I should’ve read the reviews. Iron decal is ridiculous. Nobody would wear this. Don’t waste your money.<br />Only gave one star because zero stars wasn’t an option. Highly disappointed.
1.0,"We were looking for one like the picture shows. This was a rubbery piece of crap, and has a very strong rubber odor. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1.0,One pair delivered. Pretty pricey considering I paid for a set of three.
1.0,"I ordered this in the same size as the mermaid style. 3-4. My daughter wore this for the first time today to gymnastics and it is NOTHING like the other style I ordered. She was so uncomfortable and this was such a waste of money. You can clearly see in the pictures I provided that the leopard is about 1.5-2 inches smaller than the mermaid.  I suggest purchasing a gymnastics outfit in person or on target so it is easily returnable. I didn’t bother trying this style on because I figured it was the same exact size as another outfit I had purchased, and I was wrong. I am now unable to return it because it is past the return date."
1.0,"my shell fell off the first day, very disappointed."
1.0,Ran small.  Gave it away.  Would not buy again...
1.0,Fit so tight I can't wear it
1.0,This came with holes in it. Fabric is not good and it is put together really bad.
1.0,Cheap fabric poor texture
1.0,I have no idea what women can fit this bracelet but it barely fits my eight year old I'm very disappointed
1.0,"Thin fabric, and very small at the bust. Thought it’d be cute, but looked too ‘little old lady’ in person - and was way too small across the chest and in the arms."
1.0,"I bought it since the pic looked very nice, so I decided to give it a try. It turns out to be the actual watch is not as pretty as the pic shows and the quality doesn't seem good neither. I should have got a citizen or added some to get a boluva watch instead. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />update: I found the watch movement was not accurate. DONT BUY IT!"
1.0,"Very thin.  Haven't washed it yet,  don't imagine it holding up for the long run.  However,  it fits well.  My son is very tall and thin got him medium,  fit perfect.<br /><br />Bought 3 of these, already about to tear in many places as suspected,  sucks bc fit is well for my tall skinny 17 year old."
1.0,Sweater arrived ripped and very low quality!<br />Not worth the price!
1.0,These glasses don't do a thing to cut night driving glare.  A waste of my money and I want my money back!
1.0,"I don't like the card holder and wallet  not wide enough to accommodate cash and receipts. Then the zipper handle broke off.  I tried to like it and use it but NOT. I can use it as my home cash stash, but not everyday use in my handbag."
1.0,Earrings don't look nothing like the picture. The owl is dark bronze not gold and the owl has a mustache.
1.0,"The shoes were not sturdy at all, after wearing them the third time for about an hour the strap fell off and because she didn’t start wearing them until June the window to return closed so I’m stuck with a pair of sandals that were poorly sewn. Waste of money"
1.0,"Will be sending back,some are broken, different sizes,not happy at all"
1.0,Boots came unglued around heel area on both shoes.<br />Multiple threads are sticking out throughout on the boots.Not happy with the purchase as it’s poor quality.
1.0,Already broke and only had two weeks
1.0,Is very small is for little girl  I like but is not fitting good for size smallest
1.0,"Junk, flake and peel when they get wet. Dont waste your money"
1.0,They were a bit confusing. And broke quickly.
1.0,"Cheap material, came wrinkled. Would fit a Pomeranian. I ordered a M, I'm usually a M/S.<br /><br />Don't waste your money honey."
1.0,Charm broke after 5 weeks. Junk.
1.0,The only thing good about them is they are comfortable. As far as water resistant no that's a lie and durability horable if could give a-10 star I would the soles of the boots are are cracked and hanging loose on one boot after only a few months
1.0,Poor quality! Very flimsy. Broke after one use
1.0,After washing once they had holes in them at the seams.
1.0,These are hard tipped darts & really hurt when you get hit with them. Dangerous!!
1.0,"While comfortable, These are too narrow from top to bottom for an adult face. They fit sloppy. Very disappointing dissatisfied."
1.0,"It tore the first time I tried it on, and t's not black, it's grey, and doesn't look like the picture. Don't buy."
1.0,"Could not fit at all in the bust area!!  The dress did not give what so ever, very disappointed!!"
1.0,"I didn't wear these earrings until about a month after I purchased them, and the post broke off the first time I put them on! It happened when I was putting the backing on, and the front came off. I had the post stuck in my ear. Now I can't even return it because I waited to wear them after receiving them :("
1.0,"This is such a cool print but it's a bad shirt. It arrived with a small hole at the back of the neck wear the tag goes and it runs SMALL. I was gonna return it but my husband loved the print so he said he would wear it as a yard shirt since it runs so small he would never wear it out. So I washed it and now it's shrunk and it's even smaller. And I mean small, it's like a crop top, its especially way too short. Ridiculous. My husband has worn an XL shirt for many years and this is nothing close to an XL!  And the material is very thin, and not in a good way, just cheap. This was supposed to be part of his birthday present, no way! Don't bother!"
1.0,"Super cheap fabric.  They do not match the pic, but I still like them.  They were very cheap, so you get what you pay for.  This pic makes them look like they fit as good as $70 yoga pants.  THEY DO NOT.  I had to wear a pair of thicker thight yoga pants underneath them,  because they are so thin!"
1.0,this XL is about a M can not even sip up.
1.0,I am a 34b so that is what I ordered and it is suffocating.
1.0,The top looked like someone cut the shirt on the bottom and never sewed a seam or anything. I’m so disappointed that I won’t buy from this company again!
1.0,Poor quality!!!!
1.0,"Item broke same day I got it , wasn’t able to put it around my waist bead broke straight out of packaging"
1.0,Purchase this product as a gift. would not gift this.  very thin poor made material.  I returned it it’s in transit not my problem and they charged me for this item because they have not received it yet. which was not due to my error it was in transit and I have proof. Also I wouldn’t even give it a one they had no zeros
1.0,"Pendant is small. Size described includes the connecting piece. The ""rope"" chain is scratchy and uncomfortable. Looks cheap. Would not recommend."
1.0,Bar is WAY too long its not a L 90 degree angle pretty much straight with a little bend. Will not be buying again.
1.0,"There was a seam running right down the middle on the front of the bottom of the dress!! That’s what I get for ordering a dress I knew was made in China and $14.00. Also, I am 5’7... this dress was above my ankles. Returning this item and lucky I had another one for my maternity photo shoot!"
1.0,"The outfit is the right size, but it is shapes funny. Although I am a plus sized girl it fits wrong around the middle. I gave it to a friend. It fits her the exact same way, but she doesn’t mind it. It hate it."
1.0,This dress stained my inner arms and armpits black???
1.0,Cheap garbage broke as soon as I tried to tie it.
1.0,This was a gift for a friend. He wears medium sized cycling shirts and has never had a problem. This one was way too small.  Won’t buy this brand again.
1.0,These do not come in womens sizes.  Would love to have one
1.0,The image is so blurred that it is unrecognizable - could barely make it out with a magnifying glass. I had a similar pendant in the past that I lost. This pendant in no way equals the other. Save your money!
1.0,Nothing liked
1.0,It turned green and black the same day I received it. So disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered this item for an event, but it was too small and did not fit in the places it should have. This item is not true to size."
1.0,"This dress fits awesome, but the color is not what it looks like. It is more of a baby blue than an aqua/light teal. Baby blue looks terrible on me so I sent it back."
1.0,I am literally appalled at the quality of these pants!  I have worn these only twice and I noticed the fabric has already thinned looking like black pantyhose!  Soooo embarrassing and after a total of about four hours of wearing them!!!  Should be called DISPOSABLE pants!
1.0,Very nice but I get broken
1.0,"Ordered October 5, 2015:  I loved the look and feel of this ring and really enjoyed wearing it.  My daughter was visiting from out of state and fell in love with the ring.  So I gave it to her knowing I could order a replacement for myself from Amazon.  So I ordered the ring again on March 14, 2016.  The ring that was delivered to me on March 17, 2016 was not only the wrong ring but it was too small.  I returned the wrong ring today (3/19/2016).  I really want the ring I ordered and not something totally different.  However, reading the review by a purchaser who reordered and returned the wrong ring 3 (three) times has caused me to fear reordering this ring."
1.0,"Love it, first time you wash it the color fades onto the white making it look old and drab"
1.0,This product is not at all the correct size. I bought a 2x and it fits like a men's size small. and also purchased a large which fits like a kids size. This leads me to believe that these are UK/EU/China sizes which should be specified in the description. This was a waste of my money. Very disappointed as these were Christmas gifts and now unable to be used.
1.0,"Worst quality I've seen in quite a while.  Thank you amazon for refunding my purchase.<br />Brim of hat was sewn on, maybe 30 degrees off center!<br />Brim edge (interior) sewn on to far into hat area causing painful indent into forehead<br />snap on mask left the interior surface approx 1"" from touching face.<br />Overall appearance was something to be desired.<br />sad"
1.0,"It looks great at first glance, but the quality of the visor part is super cheap.  It scratches way too easily.  I have used it a few times and have been very careful, but I see new scratches every time.  Also, the headband gives me a headache after 30 minutes of use, but adjusting the position of the headband every now and then helps alleviate the discomfort.  Also, if you decide to use it in the car, make sure to leave it in a shady spot.  This is the kind of plastic that warps easily in the sun and heat.<br /><br />This product is way over priced for the quality.<br /><br />Update: The band snapped making it completely unusable.  Trash."
1.0,The loops snag really easily and the plastic that connects the strap to the watch face snapped after only a week or so of normal wear.
1.0,"Great idea, but there are 3 overlapping seams on the inside of the coolwing that causes severe rubbing and irritation issues on the inside of my arm/armpit."
1.0,"I wear a size petite medium but I purchased the largest size due to other reviews.  These sports bras are made for thin women, just be aware of that.  If you have any shape, I'd look elsewhere.  I cannot imagine trying to take off this bra after workout when your body and bra are soaked!  You may need a pair of scissors."
1.0,Really cheap and poorly constructed. Looking ripped for no reason within days
1.0,SO small and cheap
1.0,Has plastic clips on straps. Looks cheap. Going back.
1.0,"Opened the package, the chemical smell is horrendous. It's enough to make a person sick, chemicals absorbed into the body :( They are also ugly, look like peter pan shoes. Immediately shipped back."
1.0,"Other ONEFIT items fit per the sizing description but not these.  I usually wear a 28-30.  These would fit a large, maybe a 34 waist.  NOTE:  Some 'ONEFIT' stuff is spot on in sizing whereas some is way out of line with respect to published sizing."
1.0,Not real sheepskin and white Velcro on black boots.
1.0,Do not buy this ring ...it is adjustable and when you adjust it it doesn't keep its shape and when i put it on andvtried to fit it to my finger it broke in half between the flowers
1.0,Material very itchy looks poorly made
1.0,Complete waste of money. Do not buy!!!
1.0,All of the trinkets (mermaid tails and smaller gems) fell off before my daughter got to wear it for her birthday. It is very cheap and poorly made.
1.0,Too large for me ! can't wear it!
1.0,Doesn't look like the dress I picked at all.  Ordered an Clarke due to bust are and still too tight.
1.0,Cheap product and nothing like the picture.
1.0,"First received a shard of metal pierced my finger. Wasnt impressed, filed it down. After a few weeks started to notice black on the belt was fading, following week noticed scratches in the metal.. Its paint! Its plastic not metal buckle!! Now flakes of material is coming off the belt fabric.. Cheapest belt I have ever seen, lowest quality belt that is!"
1.0,"Runs small, not true to size. Made very well and fabric is nice. Just too small."
1.0,Tore on first wear!
1.0,Horrible fit. A gust of wind is gonna send this hat flying. Definitely made in CHINA. Don’t buy!!
1.0,Muy mal material cuando uno se la pone va votando pelusa
1.0,Wore this for first time & now I have 3 snags on it. Wasn't doing anything to make this happen. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
1.0,This costume was awesome but my daughter only got to wear it once for an hour and the moter burned up. Very disappointed!! Because we purchased it so early we are out of the refund period.
1.0,Not a stone....came broken..crumbles like charcoal.... extremely light in weight...have purchased shungite stones in past....
1.0,Ordered a 2 was sent a 10. Had to return and decided to order a different suit. This one was really cute but I didn't want to have to send it back again.
1.0,"The t-shirt I received does not have the U shape at the bottom like it shows in the photo, I do not recommend to order it. Disappointed. It is just a long t-shirt."
1.0,"This is for a child not a woman!!! Very small!! It was just a tad too big for my 5 year old and I purchased a medium. She is not overweight, if anything she could afford to gain a few pounds!"
1.0,"Husband thought it would help, he’s currently still not waking up even though it’s beeped and shocked him 🙄"
1.0,Very light plus its I crappy material
1.0,Wouldn't buy again!
1.0,The seam on the toe cuts right across the tips of your toes. Far too uncomfortable.
1.0,When did Amazin start  taking on these companies that have ridiculously wrong sized and cheap clothing and shoes. This is probably mail the fifth order of something I'm never going to be able to use. I expect more from Amazon sick with the good stuff please.  This was an &#34;oversized&#34; xxl shirt. It's no bigger than a  medium
1.0,I thought this would be good for my ring that’s too big however they are not comfortable at all and was pinching my finger ended up taking it off with in two day of putting it on
1.0,Very thin and flimsy material and is very small. It is marked XXL Tall but is more like a medium or large. I can’t imagine how much smaller it would get after washing and drying.
1.0,This did not fit as expected.  It wasnt loose fitting at all. And extremely long.
1.0,"do not buy, they are tiny even for a samll guy or a woman."
1.0,Very small and ugly product. Do not recommend!<br />The price don't match the quality. Don't waste your money on this product.
1.0,"letters not spaced right, horrible quality, so not worth it"
1.0,It runs very small..I had to give it to my sister as a gift because it fit horribly
1.0,Very Unhappy again b/c the earnings werea totally different color than the ones advertised!!!
1.0,This does not fit as pictures it looks like a tent on me and is a heavy material not cotton as it looks in picture
1.0,ADVERTISED AS MERINO MENS PANT. PACKAGING SAYS THEY ARE A BLEND. SO THAT MEANS THEY CAN BE 10 PERCENT MERINO AND THE REST POLLY WHO KNOWS.<br /><br />THEY GIVE YOU THIS BUT YOU PAY FOR THAT..
1.0,"I love the blouse, unfortunately the sleeves were to tight and that prevents me from wearing the blouse and giving it a high score."
1.0,"Runs about 5 sizes too small, ordered a size up & couldn’t get my arm in the sleeve!!"
1.0,The clasp broke first time I tried to put it on.  I can replace clasp but...disappointed.
1.0,Way too small. Will be returning.
1.0,All the stone fell out in 2 week
1.0,To many pockets for me
1.0,They turned my fingers green within just a couple hours of wearing them
1.0,"Of course I wanted to wash them before putting them on my baby, every single one of them fell apart. They’re garbage."
1.0,You CAN see your underwear through. Very disappointed and will never buy this brand again. Spent $25 for CRAP.
1.0,Horrible hood.  Packed in a tiny plastic square package.  Pull out hood check fur on hood before taking out of package.  I’m returning very disappointed.
1.0,Is too light it flew out my window while driving 😫😭
1.0,Thought by the product title it would actually have charms. Don't be disappointed like me....it was just the bracelet you can get anywhere. No charms included.
1.0,It turns your finger green & they change color of the rings
1.0,looks and fits nothing like the display this dress fits and looks horrible on...the material is completely different l...i need a refund..thank you
1.0,The print was backwards!
1.0,Purchased for my mom for mother's day she had been wanting one she said it doesn't fit right and doesn't look like the picture... It was the only one that would be shipped on time... Mother's day gift failed 😔
1.0,Add is a lie did not send you product that is pictured I even sent him a question about the product and he told me yes and I still got a completely different fox jersey which is the 2020 prix youth jersey.Not what I wanted and stained
1.0,"I expected some natural variability in each stud, but these are two widely different types of stone. One is translucent the other is creamy and opaque. I am disappointed these stones were put together in a pair."
1.0,"I ordered this in white. Firstly, it reeked of cigarettes when I opened the package. So much so that it set my allergies off. Secondly, the material is completely see through. Thirdly, it's not a skirt as described it's bat wings attached to the pant. Finally, the material is horrible"
1.0,"It was mentioned in the comments to buy a larger size than you would normally wear, so I did. They were still too small. The company was kind enough to let me reorder, at no cost, another pair. The second pair fit but was so uncomfortable I could not wear them. The sole was hard and even adding the shoe cushions didn't work. They seemed uneven to walk in. As if there were lumps in the sole. I ended up giving them away. The person I gave them to ended up giving them away as well.<br /><br />Total waste of money! I am glad that they were not that expensive. But I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"I bought this thinking I’ll be sexy for my anniversary. Material is cheap, runs super small and this dress doesn’t look nothing like the dress that’s being advertised."
1.0,"Can’t believe the back is not leaking proof, won’t buy it anymore."
1.0,Save your money. Look for a coat elsewhere. Read reviews and ordered a size up and it is still too small in arms. The lining ripped to shreds the first time I tried coat on. It is very poorly made. The whole lining ripped out of coat with just a slight tug on seam.
1.0,Disappointing<br />My return window has closed so I will have to live with it
1.0,"I received a used product, full of dirt, scratches and stains. It also has a dent that is really visible and it won't go away. Also, the quality of the silver painting on the A and the sides is not good.<br /><br />This is expensive enough to receive something like this, not even new. This was obviously used. I WILL BE RETURNING IT AND GETTING MY MONEY BACK.<br /><br />UPDATE: I CAN'T EVEN RETURN THE ITEM EVEN THAT IT SAYS ON THE DESCRIPTION THAT YOU CAN RETURN IT. CAN;T FIND A WAY TO CONTACT THE SELLER. DO NOT BUY IT."
1.0,Missing a “O” on one of the boos
1.0,"Complete trash! This cracked trying to take out the links, very cheap. Waste of money, avoid purchasing."
1.0,"The bracelet looks great, but it came with some weird looking dried up leafs in the package. It had a weird odor almost like body odor. Not exactly what you want to wear on your wrist. Going to spray it with some cologne hoping that smell goes away."
1.0,There is no easy way to put it on. It bulges out when I finally get it on. I will be sending it back.
1.0,La bota es demasiado pequeña ni una persona que tenga el pie demasido delgado entra  Como no tiene cierre la boca es demasiado pequeña arriba y no lo dicen los comentarios en el en el internet también quiero comentarles que no me parece justo que no me hubieran dado el reembolso completo de los $59 solamente me enviaron $54.67 sabiendo que no es culpa mía sino culpa de ustedes o de la fábrica que laboró la bota gracias
1.0,The charm says HE instead of SHE.
1.0,"Review it broke after less than a week of wearing it I went to put it on and the chain snapped super cheap chain because all I did was pull my hair up out of the way it pulled on the necklace and it snapped, waste of money.<br /><br />This necklace is so pretty and one of my favorite pieces. I love the mother holding the child on the pendant it is such a beautiful illustration. I like the length of the chain ok, I wish it had an adjustable chain. So far the chain has not rusted and this point. I do not wear it all the time but when I do it looks great and hangs just right on the neck I just wish it could be tightened on some occasions. It also has yet to turn my skin green so I am hoping we will continue on that path. It is a silver plated base but not sterling so I am not sure if it will turn my neck green or not. It shows that it comes with a gift box and it does but instead of being put in the box correctly it is in a baggy. So before gifting it you may want to open the box and adjust it correctly. It will is a beautiful necklace and image. The necklace goes on easily and has yet to get caught in my long hair. If you have long thick hair you know the struggle with necklaces and their clasps. One part of the piece I do not enjoy is the “diamond” or cubic zirconium pieces they look fake and make the piece goddy. It takes away from the beautiful mother and daughter image and makes the jewelry look cheap. If they were not there someone probably would not be able to tell the difference between this piece and a James Avery necklace.<br />In summary the image on the necklace is beautiful, but the chain cannot be adjusted and the little fake diamond pieces do not contribute to the necklace in a positive light. I would recommend this purchase and I am a satisfied customer.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
1.0,"I’m unhappy.  The medium was more like an XL.  It was poorly made, the pattern of the fabric wasn’t lined up on the bodice nor was it aligned before sewing.  One side is an inch bigger than the other and it’s super short.  I had to alter the dress myself for my event."
1.0,Itchy fabric. Weird lining that is short and tight. The waist is waaaaay too small. I feel highly flammable in this fabric.
1.0,"Loved the bracelet. Wore it shopping, looked down, and insert was<br />missing. Now I only have an empty bracelet.<br />Would not recommend buying it.<br />Needs to be improved on the magnets. Not strong enough to hold."
1.0,The size is so small. May be a US3. Should have the description of the size. I thought it is one universal size. Returning the product
1.0,The color what exactly like the picture no complaints there but thats about it. I’m 5.1” and the dress was a little short only could wear with sandles and the material was like a costume material so for a party or even to run errands its a bit cheap looking for that
1.0,Too small... not much larger than a quarter.
1.0,"was excited to receive them but quality is very poor, pic looks better then in real life"
1.0,"This product came apart at the stitching after the first wash. They fit great, but you can only wear them 1 time."
1.0,The quality isn’t bad for the price. However in my opinion the design is flawed because of the opening on either side of the dress which I do not like.  Additionally the elastic around the waist is exposed in one part to the front which I absolutely hate.
1.0,Muy mala impresión y color de tinta....
1.0,Really bad quality.... nothing like the picture
1.0,"As they came out and mentioned after I received this, it is way too small. Looks like it would be a very nice and comfortable sweater, but I cannot wear it. I even ordered a size larger than I thought I would need because of where it is manufactured, but still way too small. Wouldn't mind trying another in the proper size."
1.0,Cheap garbage..worse than flea market junk
1.0,Itchy wrinkly material and much too small.
1.0,Looks cheap & charms are too childish for a 16 year old
1.0,very very small. Barely  fit on top of son head lol. Don't fit as picture
1.0,"Poor quality, very very blurry. Avoid so your wife won’t be disappointed too!"
1.0,Punches while wearing it
1.0,Bands feel cheap and clap breaks easily which causes the watch to fall off. You should avoid these.
1.0,"I am returning it because a couple of the bands did no lock securely,"
1.0,The shoe fell apart completely after being worn for exactly 7 days.  The entire sole separated.  Very poorly made.  You can see from the bottom they were barely worn.  Only indoors to school.
1.0,"Oversized in a bad way.  Not flattering on the face.  Extremly flimsy and cheap, definitely not worth the almost $11 I've gotten cheaper, sturdier and nicer sunglasses at less of the price."
1.0,Very disappointed.  Received this necklace and the clasp doesn't work.  When you pinch the sides it doesn't open at all.  Should have better QA before you ship to a customer.  Thank you Amazon for providing a return.
1.0,Horrible. Not even close to labeled 6m size. Cute designs but very inappropriately sized
1.0,"dont but this, the paint job is super low work, the mask is tin too. dust particle could easily come in. very poor products."
1.0,Very uncomfortable maybe ok for a kid
1.0,Look<br /> as if. It was bought at the dollar store
1.0,"Okay like no. It's navy blue, not even green and absolutely not flowey at all. I don't even think I could wear it to sleep in."
1.0,Zipper would not zip
1.0,"Ordered the XS as I am extremely petite. The dress fit is odd and is not for a petite person, it’s not too bad on top, but the length and the sleeves are very long. This is not a good dress if you’re body type is short and small. I have to return it."
1.0,No screen protector built in
1.0,The band is pretty but I didn't realize I had to order the link removed tool. Now I've got to order it separately and pay for it.  Not happy.
1.0,Total and complete knock off i was completely shocked and disappointed !!!! Seriously dont even think of getting this !!
1.0,"Awful. Only word for it. I was excited for this but when it came it was very stiff, and the material was like canvas. Probably waterproof, if that's what you're looking for. Could probably use it as a cover for my grill outside. On top of that it was circus tent level large. WAY too big"
1.0,"This wasn’t the necklace my daughter wanted.  I tried to return it before I received it and it was to late . It arrived and my daughter ended up liking it and wanted to keep it . I put it on her , and a hour later it broke . I was able to fix it but it kept breaking . It was unfixable by the next day . More pieces kept breaking . Not worth it ."
1.0,Fit nicely pre first wash. After first wash has shrunk down almost 2 sizes… beware!!
1.0,To much pain
1.0,"The buttons are too close together, it pulls nothing away from the ears. Also the buttons are small and not secured tightly. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"The color and fabric was nice but the length was to long for my 5'4"" height even with a 3"" wedge."
1.0,"I tear and whole in dress. I am extremely disappointed:( I like the dress and the length is great. However, I can't wear it because it came damaged. The bag it came was not, just the dress"
1.0,Don't stay stuck even once much less multiple times. I don't know what everyone else is talking about. Not working for D cups. They give you a weird shape.
1.0,"This skirt is so short. I am 5'4"". So not tall by any means. It is about 4 inches off the floor. Super disappointed. Will definately be returning."
1.0,"Besides the fact that I ordered a D cup for my daughter for prom, and they sent all 4 as C cups, which was upsetting enough, they also  were tried on a person that has c cups and it still didn't come close to fitting. They are a very sad product.  Not happy at all."
1.0,Does not fit as expected/pictured. Falls awkwardly on my body.<br />Returned... have to PAY for shipping!
1.0,I bought these for the annual sunglasses party and these were a major fail. These were so terrible not to be worn out of the house if worn at all. There is no UV protection and the lenses were so cheap and warped we ended up popping them out. I would not buy these again.
1.0,"I love the necklace<br />BUT THE CHAIN CAME BROKEN I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SOME HOW FIX IT BEFORE I CAN WEAR THE NECKLACE SO, with that being said I rated it only a one ... I’m sorry"
1.0,Save your money! Not worth the month long wait!
1.0,"product is fine, but shipping sucked"
1.0,"I ordered this in white and at first glance, I felt pleased. It’s a very cute cut, flattering, and versatile enough to complement a variety of styles.<br /><br />But as I looked closer, I noticed that the fabric was VERY thin. Like, I can see through it like tissue paper thin. If you want to roll the sleeves up, there’s a piece of fabric on the inside that can be used to button down the sleeves - and you can see it very clearly through the fabric, as shown in my photo. I had not planned to use that strap because I think the style is cute without it, but now I feel like I have to because it looks so bad under the shirt. You could also clearly see the outline of my nude-colored bra under the shirt, so I won’t be able to wear this in professional or business environments.<br /><br />Mind you, the stock photos of the white shirt don’t show these sleeve straps in use, AND they also make the shirt look completely opaque. They are a very poor representation of the final product.<br /><br />I also don’t know if the listing has been altered since I ordered the shirt, or if I simply missed this detail when I ordered, but this shirt is not made of linen. It is a blend of 49%Rayon, 17%Nylon, 34%Polyester - all synthetic fibers. It has a rough, linen-like texture but the fabric does not breathe at all like actual linen, so it becomes uncomfortable and hot on warm days."
1.0,"I haven't purchased this, but I would like to point out that an Impala has 6 taillights. Dean drives a 67 Impala, and that's super important to a Supernatural fan."
1.0,Fell apart within a week of use.
1.0,It's a nice made shirt but very small. I am a size 12 ordered xxl. Way too small. Would fit a size 8 person. I would return it but I didn't save the packaging.
1.0,"I thought I was purchasing a high quality product and the stitching has given way after a dozen times wearing them. I would steer clear of this product , not sure if I was unlucky but I have purchased a lot of higher end shoes and not had this experience."
1.0,"Clasp binds on one side. Attaching to my Charge 2 was difficult due to one retention hardware was deformed. Tool included that's supposed to allow you to remove links did NOT work as instructed. You HAVE to go and look at youTube videos to figure it (would have been 10000000X better to include an instruction sheet (one page would cover it). The tool is almost completely plastic and VERY poorly made. Threads that should grab slip with the slightest amount of force applied. You can easily push the screw thru the base item. I had to tap the 'pin' thru in order to remove links.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this band since I have a similar design on my watch (a RADO). This one falls far short of all hopes and expectations. It's over-priced if it was &#60;$10. At almost $20, it's a rip-off. You're also supposed to remove links the same amount on each side. That means you have a coin toss to see IF you can get it to properly fit you.<br /><br />Returning the band since it's useless.<br /><br />If you don't want to pull out your hair, avoid this band for your Charge 2."
1.0,Keeping because i don't feel like return and I'll probably throw on the robe . The top is okay the shorts are horrible . Looks cheap . Not worth it
1.0,"Edit: Turns out it wasn’t that good. Looks nice, but I had to return it. It kept coming off while I was sleeping, laying down or just randomly. It started happening after like 7 days.<br /><br />I got my new fit bit 3 days ago and the band an hour ago; but so far good. I had a similar band with my charge 2 and loved it. This band feels comfortable and looks nice. I can wear in with casual or business casual clothing. For work, outings or around the house.<br /><br />If I have any issues I’ll update my review."
1.0,Flashes for one day
1.0,"These shoes are awesome. However, after using them for a couple of times, one of them stopped working. Will not charge or light up, just as the 30 day return window passed!"
1.0,"This company needs to regulate their sizes better. I ordered a 3xl--which was what their size chart said I would wear. It was too large. Returned it and ordered a 2xl. It was also too large. I returned it again, not only because it didn't fit, but also because the buttons on the second jacket had the word &#34;FASHION&#34; embossed on them in large type, which wasn't even an option shown in the photos when ordering."
1.0,"This is probably fine for someone who doesn't have hips, but, it fit tightly around my hips and was un-flattering. I returned it."
1.0,"Not pleased, if your short this catsuit might fit, but not if you’re above 5’3” ( just my opinion)."
1.0,Broke in half the same day
1.0,The fit of these is weird and way too small even though I typically wear a Medium and ordered the L/XL size. I don't like the fabric much either--catches on knits.
1.0,"Highly dissatisfied with this product. I took my measurements then read the suggested fit requirements. Ordered an XL and it doesn't fit. I wear Large Regular. This product should fit and it is skin tight, I'm a 185 solid but still. WTF"
1.0,"This top was described as a sheer mesh top. However, this top is 90% cotton and it was not worth the amount of money spend. I’m returning the top ASAP!! I’m very disappointed."
1.0,Too little had to give it to my daughter
1.0,NOT WORTH THE PRICE VERY UPSETTING HAVE TO USE 2 PAIRS FOR THE JOB OR TASK
1.0,"The tutu is child sized.  Fit my 7 year old great, me not at all.  The pink of the leg warmers wasn't neon and didn't seem to go with the rest of the collection. The earrings were much bigger than I thought they'd be but still the best item in this!"
1.0,do not buy!
1.0,Did not work. Had no way to stick on. Threw away.
1.0,You dont get what you paid for. Far from it. Id HIGHLY recommend going elsewhere. You will thank me in the end.
1.0,Horrible. Doesn't fit at all.
1.0,"I liked the slippers. I am a size 7 and ordered the 7-8 and with socks, they fit.<br /><br />However, when I took them off, the white fluff lining was shedding everywhere. All stuck to my socks too.<br /><br />Sending back because I don't want to deal with the shedding."
1.0,Couldn't get backs of the slippers to stay up. Returning.
1.0,"Bought these for our group of friends for our annual Christmas Cookie party. Within the first hour most of them had broken ties around the neck or waist area and the felt Santa Claus on the front fell off about a 1/4 of the aprons by the end of the day.  Don't even try to wash them after use.  They basically desinagrated! I wasn't expecting anything spectacular for the price, but I did expect them to last longer than an hour! Also, they are very short.  Would fit a child better than an adult."
1.0,turned yellow and my fingers green after a week of wear
1.0,"I ordered 4x larger it fit the only thing wrong with this bra, it looks like you have 1 boob right in the center of your chest. I will try to take apart and separate the cups, looks horrible. I did like the way the sides were wide, but this company probably makes all cups the same with no regard to separation according to side"
1.0,This top is very thin in material and fits funky !<br />Returning it :(
1.0,Too small on one fit...ok on the other. Confusing as the left foot felt really tight. My feet are the same size more or less and never had this problem.  Sent back.
1.0,"not worth the price, they didn't match the picture"
1.0,"Feels super cheap, and the gold was chipped when I got it. I was not​ expecting much at this price point but its the same quality as a $7 watch from Walmart."
1.0,Not true to size several sizes too small
1.0,They came ripped.
1.0,Thought material was a bit more sheer
1.0,Not what I expected did not look as portrayed online
1.0,I returned was bad quality
1.0,Smells like pure chemicals. Couldn’t  even be worn because the stench was so strong.
1.0,"The watch is brand new and the battery is already not working properly. It stops working randomly sometimes so the time is never correct. I only started wearing the watch a month after I'd ordered it so by the time I noticed, the return window was closed."
1.0,"These bras had two different sized cups in them. Like huh? They were both labeled as the same size but the purple one was smaller. I liked the stretchiness of the material, it's also very breathable, but I'm just disappointed."
1.0,I purchased pink silly laces and received RED.  Not happy but used them anyway.
1.0,"This is garbage. Unless you are a kid and have small 10 or less feet, then a cool Nike sneaker isn't going to fit. If it does, it won't look good. GARBAGE. Poor quality. Very, very disappointed.<br /><br />I think one manufacturer makes them all. I bought one of each from 3 mfg. They are all garbage."
1.0,"Way to small XXL is more like a  US 12-14. It also started losing the sequence after taking it out of the package. Very cheap, thin fabric and not a true off shoulder. Really does not look anything like the picture. I will be returning."
1.0,Dont buy this. May cause damage to face or injure a child. It feels like wires wrapped with heavy duty tash bag. Nothing as advertised. Plus comes from 3rd party. That will take longer to return and get a refund after they respond back to Amazon.<br /> Amazon cant refund you for this item.
1.0,Would have given a 5 stars but the sunglasses were WAY to tight on my son's head. He couldn't wear them.
1.0,The absolutely cheapest way to offer a hat...
1.0,Its a lot small that described
1.0,This is advertised as a men's watch and it is a women's or kids as the band isn't big enough to fit most guys.
1.0,Spend your money on higher quality
1.0,Was not what I wanted. Was under women's wifebeaters which is what I wanted. Got exersice tops
1.0,"It was supose to be navy blue, it arrived almost black. Way to dark."
1.0,Very disappointed in this product. The picture does not match the product AT ALL. I’m trying to return the item and what a hassle it is becoming. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT waste your time on this dress.
1.0,Don't waste your money.  This product does not work.
1.0,I am a 2xl so i got a 3xl and it didnt fit at all
1.0,Was very disappointed in this purchase.  I am returning it because it's already falling apart.  The toggle on the zipper broke and a rivet already fell off.  I didn't use it for a week.  I liked the idea of side pockets and because it was leather.
1.0,too hard to use
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. It literally stinks. It stained my khakis with some slight sweating."
1.0,"This is not real gold, confirmed by jeweler"
1.0,It is really tight!!!
1.0,The pearl fell out of the bracelet 1 month after purchase.
1.0,"Too wide, was not as I expected"
1.0,"The straps are poorly cut, leaving rough ends that rubbed my shoulder raw! I can't wear this."
1.0,I lost one peace bei second time waring. The fixing is not optimal
1.0,So very disappointed in these shoes for what they cost!!! I have worn them twice and the velvet in the shoe has rubbed off!🙄 I seriously would not recommend these shoes at all! I usually love my purchases but these shoes are a big fail! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,it looks different in the photo
1.0,"These masks are super disappointing, I guess you get what you pay for. The masks are falling apart, definitely low quality. It’s looks like two pieces of fabric was just glued together. All the masks are super uneven and it looks like the ear holes were just cut out with scissors. 1/5 do not recommend."
1.0,Balance is horrible
1.0,"Worn twice...while watching the Dolphins football game. While they are cute, theyre already falling apart after wearing them twice for a few hours. Really poor quality."
1.0,"The body fit on but one sleeve was skin-tight and the other was ridiculously loose.  It's like they cut them to different sizes, but they were the same length, so IDK what was up.  You get what you pay for, but this was just hilariously bad."
1.0,😡😡😡😡😡
1.0,there was advertised with wire nose. Thats not true there any all cloth.
1.0,"Weird fabric, fabric bunches weird, really loose in some areas, too tight in others, poor quality stitching, ordered a small and fit large and awkward. Brown color was completely off, was orange."
1.0,Item arrived and does not light up
1.0,The color not like  I chose and you letting
1.0,I felt that it was a little deceiving on Amazon looking at it and reading about it I got it it’s a cheap vinyl very disappointing a lot smaller than it appears on Amazon. I am returning it.
1.0,"If you look closely at the picture you can see that it has been photoshoped. The skirt if much fuller in the picture than the one I recieved. You can see the the lace pattern and folds in the skirt have been copied and pasted to make it look fuller. The dress was nice, but it was not as advertised so be aware of that. I bought a petty skirt/underskirt to make it fuller but it only helped a little. There is just not the same amount of fabric on the dress that is in the picture so no matter how much you try to make the skirt bigger it will never look like the picture. This is false advertising."
1.0,"I fell in love with these boots. I would have worn them daily. ONE day of sitting on my butt at an office job barely walking any, no stairs, the soles both came lose before I could even use this for the Halloween outfit too. I was so furious."
1.0,"Horrible, so thin and small, artificial makes you sweaty. Returning tight after opening the same day.Way far than it look  In the picture. Could not be any worse."
1.0,Turnished within a week
1.0,This arrow head was pretty poor quality.  It's worth $2 at most.  It looks much better in the photo.  It was for a friend's Halloween costume and she was really pissed at me because it broke within 5 minutes of her wearing it.
1.0,Came with broken clasp. Looks cool but really cheap. Very fast shipping. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Within two weeks time the bear came off.  Now I thought it was just this one but it seam to happen with all the charms I brought.
1.0,"It's awful. Not only is it early impossible to get the hair elastic on, once you finally do it pops right off. So disappointed."
1.0,The poor design cannot be compensated for by the  comfort of the fabric.
1.0,"This did not work. It was a waste of money. It wouldn't stay in place, it was uncomfortable, and it was poor quality. Do not purchase it is not worth your time."
1.0,"Fleece. Feels like it would be really warm. It's wide so it covers the ears well, but it is way too big for an average head. It would have fallen down, even with my ponytail though it. Needs to be about 2&#34; smaller around."
1.0,I paid too much for a skeleton band ! And it's not invitation ?
1.0,Did not fit as well as the pink one purchased a few months ago. Also the material is very coarse.
1.0,Doesn’t help when it arrives and the battery is dead. Waste of money.
1.0,Awful quality. Very big from arms and too tight from waist
1.0,"These are $33 nylons and are the perfect color hence 1 Star), but even though I took significant care to put them on, within an hour they’d run. I had the correct size so that was no issue, but as soon as I started moving, I suppose that’s when they ran."
1.0,It’s not waterproof the whole glove
1.0,this product does nothing helpful and can be dangerous negative ion products are usual emitters of radiation which can raise your chances of developing cancer
1.0,Studs are way too small
1.0,Tried it on for the first time and didn't even hook the back strap and it broke. Very disappointed.
1.0,Overall not as expected
1.0,"FUNshine sadly faded fast...Necklace batteries ONLY lasted barely 4 hours.  Hats were quite cheaply made.  We wore these at work, apparently good for only a one time use."
1.0,"Bought to give as a gift, but would have been embarrassed to do so.  Great if used as a child's art apron."
1.0,"Smelled odd, didn't fit, and then only returned 1/2 my money!"
1.0,I was expecting these to be a little more like “sweatpants” but they are not. They are more like spandex leggings that are too big. The material is extremely clingy. I would not suggest these if you have a little extra meat on your bones! Not flattering at all.
1.0,This cape was made for a child.  It didn't even cover my shoulders.  While it was pretty it was of no use to me.  Make sure you looked at the size before buying.
1.0,Very pretty but the numbers are so light they are hard to see.  The band gave me a very bsd rssh.
1.0,Love the shirt it's cute but u cant wash it not happy at all
1.0,I bought two and they fell apart after a couple<br />of days. Both od my sons loved them
1.0,"The material was nice and soft, however, the jacket smelled like a strong cider vinegar and the zipper did not work. I have returned the item and would not recommend it."
1.0,Received and tag was sown terrible onto the back with thread and what looked like fishing string.  It’s entirely tight fitting and I ordered an XL just to prevent this.  I normally wear a L.
1.0,It didn't fit like it said. It was smaller than usual
1.0,Worst thing i ever buy.
1.0,These are just too small. Very uncomfortable when wearing!
1.0,Feo parece un trapo de puso
1.0,This broke after one use.
1.0,This dress is a disaster nothing like d DaMN pic never again because y would they send a total dif dress from what PA paid for.
1.0,The product was supposed to be a pallet sale with numerous items in that order. But only the one shirt came. What a joke!!
1.0,"This dress was a complete disappointment. The material is not as expected, the length is not close to what is described. Needed this for a pagaent, looks like she will be wearing her old dress. I will be returning this."
1.0,Terrible Quality for the money. As soon as I opened the box I was very disappointed in the quality. I had purchased two cheaper bands a few or so back. Both of those bands were superior in quality compared to this band. Already the band is creasing badly in the leather after just one time wearing it out. I dont expect it to last much longer.
1.0,I normally wear a xl and I purchased a 2X and it look more like a medium. I suggest you go to size up.
1.0,Has tangled and ripped out my long hair underneath!!
1.0,Came dead enough
1.0,Donot like the lace. Returned 2 packs
1.0,"This would probably work for a child's halloween costume, but it really doesn't fit an adult. I'm pretty small (5'2) and this still is too small around my shoulders, and it doesn't drape nicely in the front because of how small it is. I'm pretty bummed."
1.0,Cheaper quality than appear in photos
1.0,This bathing suit was see thru. Do not buy.
1.0,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME...
1.0,"This dress was not only cheaply made, but WAY too big. I even sized down after reading the reviews and it still looked like a potato sack. It has a really odd hole in the chest area below the tie. I have no idea what kind of bra you could wear with this to look cute because it will show through the hole. I returned!"
1.0,Way too sheer! Thin material.  Very disappointed I was not able to return! The freeze and home repairs caused a delay.
1.0,Bought dress much bigger than I normally wear and it was ridiculously small.  Not designed for humans.
1.0,"Had to return them as they were way too big. Others had compared them to another, more expensive brand. They do not compare. At all."
1.0,"I ordered size 7-8 and received size 6-7, which wasn't even an option.  They are too small for my growing toddler."
1.0,Cheap manufacture. Broke within 24 hours of receiving.
1.0,"Didn't fit and broke as soon as I tried to attach them to the glasses. I never found the time to send them back, so I'm stuck with them."
1.0,the white garment fits OK but the gray and black ones are way too tight
1.0,"I was hoping for a nice soft sock, this thing was horrible. I returned mine."
1.0,Do not buy!!! I wore them to work and about an hour in I had to have pants dropped off to me. The material was flaking off. Literally dissolving as I wore them. And they were so itchy.
1.0,The size was perfect but the material and the outer part of the gauge was to big
1.0,"The pendant is very pretty,  but the chain broke immediately after being taken from the package.  And here it sits.  Wasted money."
1.0,After first time wearing these sunglasses the tiny screw for the leg came out and was lost.
1.0,"My daughter purchased a size larger than normal because of the previous reviews that had stated the clothing ran small.  This was an understatement.  The quality/craftsmanship is also poor.  There were several random threads left during sewing that were not trimmed.  My daughter likes the dress, so it is not wasted $$, but I will not be purchasing from this seller again and would not recommend anyone purchase from them either."
1.0,Just looked down and to my surprise the stone is gone.
1.0,Cheap fabric. Skip this one.
1.0,Sizing is WAY off!
1.0,Got torn after one week of use 😡
1.0,Horrible quality. I'm an L but order an XL just to make sure it fit. It came literally as an XS. The dress was so thin you could see everything
1.0,"It is in Spanish and was not stated as such on the order - I received the wrong item!!!!  This was an anniversary gift, not pleased at all."
1.0,"These are are of the absolute thinnest material I've ever seen. Ordered and extra large as the reviews said they run small hoping they'd fit for the majority of maternity...these would run small for a child! The elastic sucks, the ribbon is too short, they're shaped almost opposite of the picture, and the pants only come down to the bottom of my calf (I'm 5'5&#34;)."
1.0,Unbearable as stated in title review. Money wasted.
1.0,over priced. Would not purchase again
1.0,Looks petite but big and ugly
1.0,"This dress fit beautifully however,  the print is nothing like the picture shown.  For that reason,  I'm sorely disappointed."
1.0,It doesn’t fit the same as the picture the material it’s horrible I wouldn’t recommend at all it’s money thrown in the garbage
1.0,Not pleased at all. I ordered the 5pk and only received 4 shirts. AND my blacks are 2 different colors. One looks more faded.

1.0,cheap. made out of cloth.
1.0,Had two different glasses and it didn't work on either one of them.
1.0,"Bad quality, neve buying earrings on line."
1.0,"The colors are not as expected. Hard to say what is the design, hard to recognize<br />what is on the scarf-all the structures are washed out.<br />But very easy to community the person( or Co) who is making it."
1.0,Super fake.
1.0,Cheap loose fitting loses shape. Poor zipper
1.0,they didn't hold my leggings at all...
1.0,orible dress is no same
1.0,One big wrinkle!<br />Will never purchase this ugly gown  very large
1.0,"Sorry, but when clothes are coming from China, they need to post it in the description.  This shirt isn't even close to being cut like other clothing items.  Plus it is scratchy.  Looks great in the picture, but wow!  looks nothing like that in person.  Ugh!"
1.0,"Horrible mistake has been made with the production of these shoes. Got my shoes in the mail, and they're defective!!! Whoever put them together didn't do it right so the left shoe strap is too long, and I mean way to long,, it is so long that my foot doesn't stay in it. The right foot was fine. Have to return and now don't have flip flops for vacation.  I would add pictures but the Amazon app is not allowing me to do so."
1.0,They may not need water but they also fall off easily.
1.0,Not in good quality~~~
1.0,It didn't live up to description. Was very displeased.
1.0,I got this for starters it was smaller than the size shown. I even got it a size bigger and still was small. the T in Teach is peeling. Other than that it was decent shirt but really disappointed cause I was so excited to wear this to work and I cant.
1.0,Missing one of the two shirts.
1.0,Colors faded after one wash!
1.0,Broke the second day u got it. Don't even no how just fell right aloft my ankle while I was walking. Very pretty but POORLY made

1.0,Tight on knees. Loose on the pelvic area.
1.0,This was tiny! Also it took almost a month to get here. It stunk like chemicals - I’m sure because it was made it China! Do not buy! Now I just found out I have to pay to ship them back to China for a refund! Amazon you should be ashamed!
1.0,It is not sterling silver as stated
1.0,Hated these.  Feet too tight but socks stretch to the groin.  Poorly made
1.0,Cute and good size bag but inside material is very weak and very easy to rippe. Less than month without heavy use inside was tear part. Cheap but there’s reasons.
1.0,Do not recommend! Top does not sit correctly
1.0,Didn’t like how it looked
1.0,"I am so tired of buying on this site and just receiving plain “CRAP”! I so wanted this outfit to work for my Birthday but now I am packing this up and sending it right back! I don’t know who is this supposed to be for but it is NOT for me. I took it out the package today after receiving it today,tried it on and immediately repackaged it.You can see through it and the pants are not “wide leg”more like “PJ’s”.I will be headed to The Post Office first thing in the morning.I should have taken the reviews for this more serious."
1.0,"Items like this are the reason I choose not to buy clothing on Amazon. The material is thin and flimsy, it looks cheaper than the $20 it costs, the zipper is stuck (maybe glue? Unclear.), and when I requested to return it the seller asked for pictures of the zipper and the shipping label. What a hassle."
1.0,Piece of junk!
1.0,Too small of a strand. Too lightweight. Hard to clasp.
1.0,WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,Colors not as advertised. The purple is extremely gray and the green is very dull in person.
1.0,terrible bad quality
1.0,This bra is advertised as a push up bra and I ended up removing b/c it does not have that effect and was also very large and got in the way of my dress and only ended up being a nuisance. A waste of $20.
1.0,Loved these at first... took less than 2 months to get holes in the end though.
1.0,"I purchased 5 of these for my daughters wedding as bridesmaid gifts.  I purchased this product based on the reviews and they are correct it is a beautiful bracelet it really shines but that’s all , it’s just beautiful as long as you keep it in the box because it’s useless as a bracelet.  The adjustable slider did not work on any of them.  They had to use glue dots to keep the slider in place.  One of them broke where the chain connects to the stones.  Don’t buy these. I just threw $100. In the garbage.  I’m going to contact amazon also.  It comes with a paper to contact them if you’re not satisfied but they don’t give you their contact information."
1.0,"Bottoms broke when I first tried them on. The string part came off of the fabric peice! Top was big, bottom was a little small, fits awkwardly, disappointed!"
1.0,"I  bought this as a party favor for my toddler's birthday party. I was very disappointed when I opened the package, some of them arrived broken and the rest broke with the first couple of uses."
1.0,"If I could award Zero Stars, I would for this seller and their poorly-made swimsuit. The product was scratchy and didn't mold to my slender, athletic body, which almost made it hurt to briefly try on. I immediately returned the item -- months passed by -- but just was forced to contact Amazon when the seller didn't honor the return. Amazon's Customer Service is top notch though and took care of my worries and this unneeded stress.<br /> ALWAYS USE A TRACKING # WITH THIS SELLER! ...or better yet, take some honest advice: Don't waste your time nor money."
1.0,Shorts are way to short.  Length nothing like pic.
1.0,Became unraveled within 2 days of wearing.
1.0,Garbage dont waste your money. They quit working after 2 days.
1.0,The spinels on both sides are off center so I can't wear it!
1.0,It broke right after I put it on his chain. Very disappointed but not worth the gas to drive 30 minutes to a fedex or UPS place to return it
1.0,Extremely small.  Was more like a size 4 instead of a 6-8.
1.0,It is a baby poop yellow color- returned
1.0,Says it want fog your glasses thats a lie also if you have a small face it will slide.
1.0,Got a size medium for my bf they ended up being at least an XL…gave them to someone else!
1.0,Very cheaply made. The set seemed very drab & not soft. I returned them.
1.0,Loved it when I put it on. After washing the arms are too short
1.0,Did not like the material.  Cheap look.
1.0,Too small poor Quality.  Large is like S
1.0,Got this item for my daughter for her birthday she was so excited after two months the watch won’t turn on it just broke out of nowhere very disappointed
1.0,"the length was a bit short, I wanted it to hag lower however the biggest issues are... The description said it glows in the dark...., it does not, and it came apart. The tiny bottle  just simply fell away from the necklace.  The necklace has a tiny screw with and eye hole which was then used to screw into the cork. I had to glue it back in place with super glue. One the outside of the bottle, you see a little charm that is being held in place by a piece of wire. The wire end was left sharp after cutting and it kept snagging on my clothing and it pocked my skin."
1.0,"It was a nice color, just to small."
1.0,Very ugly and thin. Don’t buy. I tried it and put it back in the plastic and never touched it again. It’s just not appealing at all
1.0,So so! It seems it's turning colors 😐
1.0,Absolutely no stretch.  Disappointed.
1.0,Absolutely NOT wool hiking socks.  They are thin polyester “fashion” socks such as you’d find at a dollar store chain.  Strongly advise anyone reading this to avoid purchasing.
1.0,I loved the length of the dress. Unfortunately I didn't like the fabric of the dress. I thought it would be deniem/Jean material but it was a thin layer or cloth in blue color
1.0,"I put it on, laughed, and never used it again."
1.0,"Horrible!  Graphics are only on one side.  And the side that is painted, has very cheap looking graphics paint (it’s so light and not crisp at all).  Lastly it’s significantly smaller than the stock band (both length and width), so it didn’t fit on my wrist.  Horrible, don’t buy this, it’s a gimmick."
1.0,These socks were supposed to be blue that's why I ordered them.
1.0,"Don't waste your money. Very very little &#34;compression&#34;, they fall around my ankles constantly. Very disappointed, amazon has great choices for about $20 a pair."
1.0,"I would definitely NOT recommend this.  The material feels nice but I ordered a large so clearly I way more than 75lbs.  These are so short.  If I had the torso of a small child then this might look okay, but at last I am a freaking grownup so yeah 😳. Now if you like to were tank tops with your muffin top squishing out the bottom then yay, cause you hit the dang jackpot with this purchase.  I personally don’t take my fashion in that direction so I’d would pass on this purchase."
1.0,Ordered XX-Large.  Fit is SMALL.
1.0,Horrible! I hate that I ordered these. They absolutely don’t look like the picture. So do not order from the people that ship these or whatever because I am totally totally disappointed. They’re ugly and it isn’t real khaki material. Plus they’re not long like the picture. They’re are nothing like the picture. It’s not like a normal khaki material & they're sooooo small. I ordered an xl and it was more like medium.
1.0,"Poor quality, it broke in 5 days."
1.0,The shirt was too thin. Very sheer feel.
1.0,Cute hat but the quality was awful. I had to repair it each time I wore it. I would not recommend it.
1.0,This product its not like the picture. I received a broken collar!! I dont gonna buy it again!
1.0,"Did not like the material, cheaply made, did not like the way they fit. Bought other shorts that were less expensive, the fit was perfect, the material felt more high end. Would not recommend this short. 1"
1.0,Doesn’t run true to size. I wear 1x I ordered 1x can even zip me up !
1.0,Horrible these did not even mold to my teeth right. Waste of money wouldn't recommend buying these.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt 2 x, each time in a different size.  And both fit oddly so I returned them both."
1.0,Oh well.. Would have gave 5 stars if it did.
1.0,There's no elastic in the legs. They fit really poorly and my balls fall out the sides.
1.0,Only wore a couple times before they tarnished
1.0,These chains arrived so badly tangled and knotted that they were useless. You could not untangle them without breaking them. Do not buy.
1.0,I was very disappointed when I received my necklace. Nothing like the picture. Buyers beware. I could have gone to party city for this and pay less.
1.0,Broke after two months or light use. The screws literally came out of the wood. Would not recommend.
1.0,so small i had to give it to my 12 year old grand daughter
1.0,"this is not a set, it does not match.  The Mask is ok quality but it will not match any &#34;green lantern&#34; items because it is turquoise.  The ring did not work, and its small in size.  Really disappointed."
1.0,I did not buy this product. When I saw this my only though was what good comes out of this? Why wouldn't you just not wear socks? There probably not that comfortable either. The only thing I imagine myself using these is to prevent blisters on my ankles.
1.0,"Tight fitting, and tag is on the side of the leg and very hard to remove, so I feel a constant itch from it on my leg. They ride up too, so I get that uncomfortable legs sticking together sensation. All around uncomfortable enough underwear I have avoided wearing them."
1.0,"Material is not nice, I was expecting softer"
1.0,I got a 3x because i read a review it ran small. I wear an XL typically. This dress was tight in spots.Not even close to true size. the material is spandex feeling too. Dont order this dress. Order local. Save your money.
1.0,Will not buy this
1.0,"immediately after wearing the 2nd time, i felt like i had something in one eye.  The eye doc removed 4 small pieces of silver plastic from my eye about 24 hours later."
1.0,"Poorly made, Send it back"
1.0,These look super cute but are a disaster to wear. If you like crippling your feet try these. The bottom of the shoe has no support and the heals actually crumple.
1.0,"It looks nice, but the gold started rubbing off the first day. Ive worn it about a week now, and nearly all the gold is gone, and now is copper. Even the gold color on the  lightning bolt rubbed off"
1.0,Tarnished only few weeks using it
1.0,"Sizing is completely inaccurate. Based on reviews I sized up, but the dress is ridiculously small. The 2xl I ordered fits snug on my friend who generally wears a size small.  The dress is very long, so if you're not super model tall, legs for days, you will definitely have to hem this up.  The material is very stretchy, a pretty color and not see through, but that's about all this had going for it.<br />Editing also for refund... wishing I had screen shot my order info that stated &#34;free return&#34;, therefore meaning I should get the full refund. But no, charged return shipping so I'm only getting a refund of half my purchase price. Definitely an unsatisfied customer here."
1.0,Never will order again my fault didn’t read the metal material started to turn into basically a penny
1.0,"This vest does not heat at all. I had my battery turned on for over 30 min, but the vest didn't generate any heat at all. Plus, the vest is made of neoprene which has a very heavy plastic smell upon receiving of it. Also, the vest runs a bit large. I  was very disappointed and angry with this product since I really needed it at the time when I purchased it. Returned it in the end due to this vest can't even be worn as regular vest due to the material."
1.0,Bracelet ran small and I couldn't read the writing
1.0,"There are things I liked about the glasses, but they are useless with one of the nose pieces missing.  I am currently visiting in the country where I have no access to return.  Useless!"
1.0,"Not fitted with zero tailoring to fit any body type. If you like the Staypuf style, this is for you. My son came back and took it off before the Halloween night was over. Terrible."
1.0,"I was drenched within a minute or 2 when wearing it! Absolutely no protection for the rain. What a waste,!"
1.0,"Very Disappointed! Ordered this item for my Nurse daughter for a Christmas gift. Upon arrival, the chain was broken on one end. Not able to repair for her use. It seems at some point the shipper would chek items for damage prior to shipping items to their customers. I would not trust ordering any other item from this retailer at all as I now know first hand their shipping policies and product quality!!"
1.0,So small. Can't even fit with it all the way loosened.
1.0,I have no idea how you put this on it has no loop. I have tried numerous of ways with no luck.  I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Has nothing but fabric in it. Doesn’t hold flat like pictures show
1.0,Extremely cheap looking. Looks like something made by a two year old. Horribly made. Seams in plastic thread are very visible. Beads are rough and scratch the skin. One broke in the box even before I even touched it. Do not purchase.
1.0,"The quality of the fabric is very poor, if you have any curves or 1 ounce of fat do not order this dress.  Every little thing shows…. I returned mine."
1.0,I did not like the material of this coat it felt very costumy
1.0,No better vision with these glasses.
1.0,Shirt fades away. Only worn once for a little while at night. Next morning I saw the shirt have completely faded. All the gold shimmer was gone.
1.0,"This might be the worst “clothing” I’ve ever purchased, and I say that knowing I was going in with low expectations and buying a novelty tank top.<br /><br />It’s made out of...whatever my outer shower curtain is made from. The entire shape is 100% cut for females - the back, the taper, the curved hem, the front to back comparitive length...all female.<br /><br />This would all be forgivable because the tank is suppose to be funny... but the print is absolute potato quality resolution. It looks blurred and terrible.<br /><br />I never wore it and I gave it away."
1.0,"El producto muy mala calidad, no se parece en nada a la fotos de la publicación. No recomiendo comprarlo.<br />La mayoría de los anillos no prenden"
1.0,Fabric is heavy and dress is sewn incorrectly. I threw the dress away.
1.0,Made the swelling worse
1.0,"This product is flimsy, arrived with no instructions for use and seems the opposite of 'easy open'. Very dissapointing"
1.0,Very poorly made!!!  Cheap cheap
1.0,"This ring is a piece of  crap, A total  rip off , Looks like something out of a gumball machine,Dont, waste your money ! and its not .99 cents either, With shipping its cost about $9.00"
1.0,It broke in the first day I had it
1.0,They look like pajamas
1.0,"The product is made fairly well. There are elastic bands inside both halves to allow storage to be kept in separate areas. The chrome plating is extremely shiny and looks cheap - at least for a man to carry this... NO WAY. As far as a women to carry in her purse, I suppose it would be fine. I ordered it along with about 5 others to see which I would like to use myself. I am keeping all of them, as It is not fair to return things like this. I certainly will not use it. May give it to a grandchild to play with."
1.0,"Cheap, cheap...nose piece broke after 1 wear!!!"
1.0,Si pudiera dar 0 le daba 0 pero el artículo no está ni serca de lo que aparece en la imagen. Para mi es un estafador
1.0,"OMG .... it stink so bad and couldn't bear the smell at all. After a few wash with vinegar and salt which socked over few nights , still stinky it there."
1.0,These are very poorly made and two of the loop eyelets broke completely off within 5 minutes and I had to return them to get my money back because I sure don't want anymore of these.
1.0,Very thin. Hoodie strings frayed considerably after first wash. Not even close to being warm enough for fall hoody. Maybe good for summer night or a southern state. Not for New England. Somewhat small in size.
1.0,Really love the product.  Looks get. But the fit was not true to size.  I can’t send it back. There was no return bill 😫. The five x. Was more like a xl!
1.0,Runs 2 sizes too small. Size up for a decent fit.
1.0,I ordered extra large & it fit like a medium. Skin tight on me!! Super mad! I really liked it & wanted it to fit good. VERY disappointed!!!!!! :(
1.0,This is a novelty item and will not hold up to day to day use.
1.0,These did not fit in my ears at all. I was disappointed.
1.0,"My kid liked how these fit/felt/looked. But they are not durable at all. Within one month, they had holes in the toes of the shoes. The sole was completely worn off at the toe of the shoe. It may just be the way my kid runs/walks or that he is pretty tough on shoes, but they were completely trashed within 6 weeks."
1.0,This hat turned up in a mustard color rather than the described color of brown. It’s not even similar to the picture shown. Really disappointed!<br />You can see how mustard it is in comparison with the flowers and pumpkin in the picture taken.
1.0,"I ordered an XXL, though I'm an Xl. It's extremely huge, so I ordered my size. Just as big. Neither one looks anything remotely close to the pic. I'm gonna see if I can't tailor it myself to be what I want. since they are too much hassle to send back."
1.0,(THEY ARE MESSY.)...&#62; SLIP & SLIDE & TWIST AROUND... . THEY ALSO HAVE HOLES ALONG THE STRECH TOPS &#62; NOT VERY DURABLE ...'I AM LIVING IN COLD COUNTRY & BELIEVE IT OR NOT; THEY DON'T EVEN SELL LEG WARMERS SO I BUT THEM THRU AMAZON...
1.0,I received it quickly. It was just as Described & looked in the photo. I really loved it. Unfortunately the chain & clasp are very cheap and broke the first time I wore it. I need to take to Jewlers to see if it can be repaired with heavier link & clasp.
1.0,This is the smallest 3x I've ever got not even wearable don't waste ur money like I did
1.0,If you are a size 12 do rider a large or extra large. Medium was too snugly fit. Left dissapointed
1.0,Terrible quality. I sent it back.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f6fd46f59e731fd15cebde3f05c0b89d]] This dress is raggedy. It has a similar pattern but is a completely different dress. It’s super cheap and the inside material is white which would show if you even chose to try and where this dress. The seller should be ashamed selling this dress. It’s not at all what is listed.
1.0,Cheap<br />Quality
1.0,Missing the bronze skull hand
1.0,"I just got these. They are way to big for anyone's head. They fall right off. They were too big on me, my dad, and my boyfriend's head."
1.0,The size was too small and the material felt very thin. Cheaply made
1.0,Looks like I was wearing scrubs and about to audition for a role on Greys anatomy. Very poor material and thin. Baggy and not in a good way
1.0,They're too small and i am normally an 8 1/2 or 9. They should put in the description that they run small. Very disappointed and if i knew how to go about a return and had time id definitely do so. Bummed out!
1.0,Ridiculously sized! A 2XL is about the same as a small!!! Can't even wear it under anything!😡
1.0,This is horrible quality. Returning it. The stitching is so bad. It looks like someone who is just learning to sew made it.
1.0,extremly see though
1.0,Fits nice on size 7.5 foot prior to washing.. then they shrink and hardly fit a child size 3 foot. Don’t waste your time or money!
1.0,After wearing for a week they are falling apart. Very poorly made. They look like they are years old. They are not worth the money I spent on them.
1.0,Broke before I got to wear them
1.0,The bow tie is sewn on.
1.0,Do NOT buy this. The fan stopped working after about 5 minutes. Piece of crap! You
1.0,They have a horrible muste smell.  I can't get rid of the smell
1.0,"The cufflinks were a Father's Day Gift for my husband.  They look nice except both fell apart when I opened the box.  The 2 knobs on the stems were missing, found them at the bottom of the box.  The face of the cufflinks have no cover, some pieces of the watch mechanism came off, one is even hanging by a nylon thread.  My husband loved them in theory  (his hobby is watch repairing). The face surely must have a piece which keeps the watch parts in place.  All I want is to get a replacement pair of cufflinks, which are well put together, will hold together, have knobs on the stems, have a cover on the mechanism face (glass or plastic) so the watch parts don't fall off."
1.0,Faded like a day after wearing
1.0,"Looks nice outta the package, shows dirt easily, broke within a week of normal wear."
1.0,Very flimsy!  Not worth the money.
1.0,item is VERY CHEAPLY MADE. I AM SO DISSAPPOINTED. AS SOON I I GOT IT I PUT IT ON AND INSTANTLY BROKE IN HALF. THEY ARE CHEAP IN PRICE AND CHEAP IN PRODUCT. DONT WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY. NOT WORTH IT
1.0,"This came and did not in any way look like the color you see in the picture, it was the color in the picture that made me order in the first place, it was all a greenish color, not what I wanted. Returned."
1.0,I didnt like it. too big for my style.
1.0,Bought for my husband for Father's Day.  Broke after 1 day wearing.  And Amazon's 30 day window had already passed.  So I am stuck with it.  Have to throw it in the garbage.  Just like my money I spent on it...
1.0,"The fabric is poor quality and looks terrible after a few washes.  The fabric also picks up and holds onto lint, pet hair, etc.  These have been quickly religated to at home comfy pants only."
1.0,Very cheap and has no shine at all. CAME TO ME TARNISHED
1.0,this shirt came in a vneck and did not have all the bands name in it .. not worth it sizing is horrible it is not true to size
1.0,The size is for boys not for men. So bad quality also you can see through it!!
1.0,Box and hat were delivered crushed.
1.0,Must have been made for someone a size xsmall because a 2x certainly doesn't fit me!
1.0,I wanted to have better vision at night but these glass-covers did nothing for me.  I have better luck with night vision goggles for snow skiing!
1.0,"This dress confused me. The top and bottom are made of very different material. The skirt is plastic-like. The seam where the top and bottom meet ribs against your skin uncomfortably. This seam makes the skirt of the dress puff out strangely. There are two zippers. A nice hidden one on the side, and a bulky one on the back. I don't understand why. I had to return this dress."
1.0,"Don’t buy, cheap shirts made in a sweatshop.  Shoulder seam is absolute crap.  Rip off."
1.0,Broken when received. Not made very well at all
1.0,Pretty dress but very cheap. It has this chincy  hooks holding the straps together that broke when I put it on .
1.0,Returned. Cheap and small
1.0,"The glasses arrived with a screw out.  I didn't even have a chance to try them on.  I had to make 2 trips to the UPS store to get it returned.  Next time, I'll think twice before I commit to buying this cheap stuff."
1.0,Bezel fell off instantly.  Glad there was a warranty.
1.0,Too big !
1.0,El diseño es bonito pero<br />El material es muy corriente<br />La talla no es exacta<br />El precio es caro para el tipo de tela que usan para hacer el jumpsuit
1.0,Sandals were comfortable but there is a terrible smell to the shoes. Smell is either the rubber they are made from or the bag they are shipped in. I let them sit out for 5 days hoping the smell would dissipate but it did not. I will be returning them.
1.0,"I'M SORRY TO SAY, I BOUGHT 2 RETURNED BOTH. THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP LOOKING, POOR SEWING, VERY DISAPPOINTED, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A CUTE OUTFIT. HERE'S TO HOPPING THEY REDO AND REPOST WITH MUCH BETTER MATERIAL"
1.0,The back looked unfinished. The quality of the material was not good. I returned and would not recommend this as a sports bra nor as a crop top.
1.0,These are literally made out of swimsuit material NOT sweatpants at all. I have never seen something so poorly made. Didn’t even bother trying them on
1.0,"Vacuumed sealed so tight, the package was hard as a rock. When I opened it, it had been sucked so tight, the skirt was stuck to itself and made sounds as I peeled it apart from itself....as the red color peeled away from the silver under-color because the skirt was so stuck to itself. It was also extremely wrinkled from from the vacuum sealing and despite the RIDICULOUS “professional dry clean only” tag, I ran it through the washing machine and dryer twice, and the exact vacuum sealed wrinkles remain in place. VERY disappointed!!!"
1.0,The string is not as it seemed. It looks like therea three but its only one. Love the pendit
1.0,The stitching was already coming apart before I opened the bag it shipped in. Very poor quality. Returning this item.
1.0,"IF I could give this 0 stars I would! The only reason for 1 star would be that I love the print. This is very poorly made. There is a piece of material sticking out one of the straps that hold the cuff down that should have been tucked and sewn and the other one isn't sewn closed at all. The bottom is uneven and too snug in the hips. I thought I'll wear it anyway. Then after one wash on gentle cycle and hang drying, it was ripped at the seam at the shoulder! I tried to add pictures but nothing happens when I click &#34;add a photo&#34;."
1.0,I bought 4 of these and ones broke at the clasp and the on the 2nd one the metal or whatever its called rusted. Not very happy at all. Ive ordered quite a few things in july and August and the back pack I purchased for my daughter for school came in the mail w the zipper broke we waited aprox 2wks for it and it has a busted zipper so no im not very happy w somme of the purchases we have made im not a very happy customer
1.0,Ordered larger than my pant size and still didn’t fit
1.0,"These earrings are most certainly NOT hypoallergenic, surgical stainless steel. I am sensitive to common metals, and I had a reaction to the metal stud and plate within 6 hours. As a reference, I have multiple other surgical stainless steel piercings I obtained from piercing parlors that have never given me such a strong reaction.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will be returning them immediately."
1.0,"it was wide & long enough, but had a very high waistline, not like the picture portrayed & did not appear to be sewn very well."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e12ab705fb6f1651565fab651186256b]] These do not work as a buckle for polypropylene strap.  As you can see by video it slips.  I bought thinking it was a 1 in buckle but requested refund which was  taken care of quickly. Thank you Amazon why this gets 1 star
1.0,Very disappointed. Felt it would not hold up. Expected material with more body to it.
1.0,I got these headbands to wear over earbuds to keep them from falling out while doing water exercises above the water level.  They are thin and do not stay on.  Continually slipping off.  Not good quality material.  Very disappointed.slip off easily
1.0,"terrible, all reviews that are 5 stars got free items"
1.0,This will not fit on a Pandora bracelet
1.0,Bad idea
1.0,"I bought two belts size 44 a year ago.  I would have rated them a 5.  After a year of wearing, one has fallen apart, literally.  Do not buy.  Today I would rate as 1"
1.0,Go it thinking it would be super cute and it ended up coming with a big hole right in the middle of the stomach part. They also won't let me return it so although it was cute I wouldn't recommend it to a friend
1.0,Very poor quality!
1.0,"After wearing them for a month, the earnings turned black. I wish I could return them. It is not what I was expecting."
1.0,"This might fit a petite, slender person or a child, but not a plus size woman in america. It wasn't wide enough to button up, and the sleeves ends before my wrists and are the same width from shoulder to wrist. I guess if i was an obese skeleton this would fit. I've noticed that clothes being shipped from china are just clothes that can only fit someone from china. having been there and shopped there, i experienced the same issues buying clothes there. the sleeves were always too tight and too short, and the rest of the shirt was either too short in length, too narrow, just too not western builds. pass on this one."
1.0,its a real shame i never got this order bc its super cute and was a good price on a few outfits...
1.0,The print is exactly that... looks like a poor quality printed image printed on “fabric.” And the fabric is not breathable at all. Reminds me of those parachutes you used to play with in elementary school PE class.
1.0,"Item doesn’t stretch & very small, disappointed"
1.0,Not as good as it looks
1.0,I ordered these for a camping and hiking weekend for my 8 year old daughter. The large tread and waterproof qualities were two of the things I loved. Unfortunately these are horribly made. They didn't last two days. The first day the tongue came out of one of the shoes (they are only held in by two small stitches) and the other one is about to fall out. She literally wore them twice and they will have to be thrown out. After an hour long hike the shoes look like they have been through the wars!
1.0,You could see the pattern of the shirt through the screen print and it wasn't centered on the shirt. Also runs large in my opinion.
1.0,It's unmanageably big!  Make sure you are aware of it's HUGE size before purchasing.
1.0,It didn't fit. The description should have been more clear.
1.0,The fit was terrible can’t wear it
1.0,"Not was good. I Not recommend this article, no arrived."
1.0,Tiny l would never buy again.
1.0,"Totally defective product. I followed fitting instructions to a T, and the strips still did not stick to shoes. I would not purchase this product. Find another earthing/grounding product!"
1.0,"Well, it is difficult to grab the dishes. Too bad I used, otherwise will return."
1.0,So my first one was broken upon arrival. Second worked fine for 2 months and stopped working. Looks nice just built awful.
1.0,Nice design but after using it for 3 weeks the ink of the lens went away and now I see everything blur.  Use it for 3 weeks and more waste for the planet.
1.0,very dissatisfied
1.0,Thought they would be individually wrapped? Instead in one vacuumed sealed bag?
1.0,They were vinyl gloves not latex. The seller did not list the product correctly. Big difference in usability between latex and vinyl from a performance perspective
1.0,Looks and feels like something bought out of a quarter machine. What you pay for is what you get.... I received a very similar bracelet but not the one pictured which I ordered. The bracelet is warped and sits crooked on my arm. Don't waste your money. Pay more and get something worth wearing.
1.0,Ordered a 2xl for my guy. They were so small he almost ripped them in half at the knees. Couldn't pull them up all the way. Already sent back for refund.
1.0,Veil is still and doesn't have an overall high quality look.  Ours had small holes.  Do not recommend due to quality of material and odor.
1.0,The dress was ok. Not much attractive. The threads were coming out of the dress.
1.0,I ordered a large and it fits like a small. It’s a crop top but the cut is right under my bra.
1.0,"Comes folded and it's hard to get creases out, can't figure out how to remove them. Will be sending it back."
1.0,wayyyyyy to small
1.0,Cheap af
1.0,The tank doesn't look anything like the picture and is so short doesn't even cover my boobs. Im not huge either. I pulled out of package and fabric was falling all over plus strings.
1.0,"Just like so many of the other reviews, the calf part of these pants are entirely too small. To make matters worse as soon as I opened the package, the button fell off. Terribly quality!!!"
1.0,"The material is nothing I've seen before, not in a good way.  It was like a plastic almost when the description said polyester. Size runs small and I will not wear this again, aweful!"
1.0,"These were really cute but when I went to open them up to wear them, one of the pieces just came off!  I had only had them a week so it was most definitely not wear and tear.  Pretty pissed off because the style was what I wanted."
1.0,It would have been nice if the spellinh was correct... no time to re-order. Waste of money.
1.0,I liked them if they didn’t break so easily bought 4 pairs and they all broke lol nice on the eyes though wish they lasted
1.0,"I purchased the yellow necklace and it looked orange. There was no yellow in the necklace as all. this was a gift and thankfully my mother loved it, however, I was definitely disappointed."
1.0,"If you're looking for a watch that looks really nice, but doesn't operate, this is the one for you. The bracelet and watch face look terrific. I ordered the first one, and the main clock stopped operating within 12 hours. I ordered a replacement, and the date chronometer would not function out of the box. So, if telling time or having a watch that actually works is not important to you, I would say you've found the perfect item. Good luck."
1.0,These barely fit over my legs and would not go over my leggings to wear with my boots. Very disappointed with this order.
1.0,"tried to use them for the first time, and the foam padding around the inside just fell apart! Since it's been more than 30 days since purchase, no option of returning or refund. Definitely not worth it!"
1.0,"Quit working in a week or so, returned"
1.0,"I purchased 5 different types of the women's Tommy John's and every single one rode up my behind.  All their advertisements state ""best pair you will ever wear guaranteed…"" but when you try to return for a refund they refuse to refund your money because you wore them. How are you supposed to determine that they are the best pair you ever wore if you are not allowed to wear them? Every single pair rode up my bum, do not buy them, it is a scam, they are very expensive and you cannot return them"
1.0,"La bota está rota ,, está sucia y despegada la suela ?????, cómo es posible k manden el producto en esa situación??? Estoy muy molesta !!!Lo k enviaron lo considero basura !!!!"
1.0,The dress showed up with two different tones of green. The seam was a a split between to the two tones. Like they ran out of fabric from batch 1 and just changed over to batch 2 not caring.<br /><br />Then fit was great and I really liked the length but the fabric color ruined it.
1.0,They don't glow in the dark.
1.0,Do not purchase this item. The sword is very small and looks cheap. Once you purchase you are unable to get a refund for the item.
1.0,Terrible never get this
1.0,I wear a Large in everything else.  This was an XL and I couldn't even squeeze into it.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Fabric developed holes and tears after worn twice. Have bought these before without these issues. Maybe they have downgraded the fabric but this is nota a quality pair of men’s underwear. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"Even the birds are singing about it! CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!"
1.0,I feel I paid way too much for the cheapness of the material.
1.0,Material is very thin. Not what I expected
1.0,"The seam that is supposed to reach the waist is too short. One would have to have a very short upper body for this to fit. It’s a shame because it’s a pretty dress, but whoever made this particular one got his/her measurements wrong!"
1.0,It fits nice but doesn’t look it picture it and a bad design on item also I mhated the material it was made from
1.0,NOT what is in the picture - I received a PLAIN pair of earrings!!<br />But for $7 buck I should have know better!!
1.0,The dinosaur's tail is so heavy it drag's the whole earring backwards so it looks like the dinosaur is raising it's front legs up while falling down on his tail. The whole earring itself is comically large. It's a disaster
1.0,Terrible product. Doesn’t fit correctly. Rides up and won’t stay down. Very cheap.
1.0,One sandal was too small but the other fit perfectly.
1.0,These sleeves are terrible.  They do not stay up at all and they are also too short. After a couple of washes they are basically rags.  Seller's customer service is just as bad.  Do not buy!
1.0,Advertised as “antique silver” finish. Looks like shiny silver paint somewhat chipped now.  Earrings were loose in small box inside very large box. No padding in small box and not fastened down so constantly rubbing together during shipping. Not worth returning but would not recommend buying this product or anything from this vendor.
1.0,The ring was ok I guess but my girlfriend broke up with me right before I was gonna give it to her on Valentine's Day.... So I'm sad lol
1.0,Ridiculous fit. I hate it
1.0,"The material is ok, it's just that it is Toooooooo Small. I have other baseball jerseys that are 2X and they fit just fine."
1.0,It looks cute but it very big for my daughter.  It is also see thru so you can’t just wear it as a dress. You need to put something under it.
1.0,Not satisified. :-(
1.0,Backs too loose don't hold to the stud
1.0,The zipper on the inside broke the 3rd day off hadnit. Sending it back. The shoulder straps are way too small.
1.0,So disappointing.  One stretcher broke before it was even in the pants leg.
1.0,Not worth it. My hooks started breaking off within a month of having it.
1.0,Dress arrived very wrinkled. The material of the dress was very cheap. The elastic under the bustline felt streched out. Dress size is true and exact.
1.0,The color and design of fabric were as shown.  The fabric was a cheap but most disappointing was the cut or pattern was not as shown. There is no slit in the arm. It is just sleeveless.  I'm not sure why they are showing this one to look like a deferent pattern. I hate it myself because I already have a nicer one in this style.
1.0,I got these for my boyfriend who normally wears medium in shirts. I sized down to a small so that they'd be more fitted. They fit him more like a size large. And the material is just awful. Super flimsy and cheap. I'm returning these immediately. Don't waste your time and money on this brand. I had a similar issue on their women's shirts I bought for myself.
1.0,Already has a hole after two washes.
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on
1.0,Looking for 5 x or 6x
1.0,Very big and you can't adjust
1.0,The top was way too small while the legs where way too big.  I had to return this item because it did not seem to be made according to size.
1.0,"So disappointed. It already came in broken, the material isn't good. Even after trying to fix the pendant hangs wrong"
1.0,VERY cheap! Material is not as it appears. NOT worth the money spent. Thankful it could be returned.
1.0,This fit well but the printing is horrible. It is very sloppy and looks sprayed on with no distinct edges. Very poor quality imaging.
1.0,Ordered & broke trying to put in.  Returned & 2nd pair broke!!!
1.0,I always keep sunglasses and reading glasses in a hard case. I only wore these a couple of times when the frames popped open. No longer available so I guess they have problems. No longer returnable - cheap China stuff. Not even worth one star.
1.0,"it is actually made in China not USA. There is a ""made in USA"" sticker cover/on the original box where it show it was ""made in China"". The statement on Amazon product page stress that is made in USA with high quality which does not looks like true anymore. Further, based on the lot # on the top of the box, it show it was manufactured in Sep 2020 when the production line of mask in the US still very limited. All of these support the idea this production was actually made in the China. I prefer product made in the US with high quality than China made production even if it is more expensive. In this case, the price is more expensive than most of similar product (kids mask). However since it is made in China, I don't know if I can trust the quality. If I know it was not made in the US, I really won't purchase it.. I wish to get all my money back. Thank you"
1.0,"Ordered this for a Halloween costume and it arrived within a couple days which was great but the product is not like it is pictured. Beard is short, BRIGHT orange, does not fit well at all. Would like to return it it's that bad."
1.0,"The smallest sizing ever.  Ordered an XL and it was still too small to fit right.  I'm only a U.S. size 8, 5'4'', 145lbs so I'm pretty average sized."
1.0,"I ordered a dress back in Jan for my daughters birthday in February. It was due to arrive just a few days after her birthday which was fine with her, she loves lemons and for the price the dress was perfect. I wake up on the day it’s supposed to here and now it’s saying another month out?? They couldn’t have gotten ahold of me any sooner than the day it’s supposed to arrive? I canceled. Very poor customer service ."
1.0,Very bad finishing. Spiky .. I had cuts between big toe and other<br />RETURNING
1.0,"I've ordered lots of masks, and these are the worst quality that I have received. They are really thin and flimsy, and don't have a good fit over the nose like other masks. Also the color was a very pale pink, not like the color shown. This was a waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
1.0,I returned this item runs very small.
1.0,"I ordered a small for my 12 year old, got it and put batteries in. Didn’t light up. Amazon sent a replacement- same thing doesn’t work. Junk, don’t buy. This was 30 bucks. Ridiculous."
1.0,"First day, not even a full day, the chain started to literally fall apart. I would really like a refund because this literally has fallen apart a few hours after opening the package and nothing was don’t to this product. I am severely disappointed."
1.0,the Large is too small like a small M
1.0,Super thin. Only has hoop for ears. Does no hook behind.
1.0,Wow. Very small pair of earrings
1.0,Quality wasn't there.
1.0,OH My I thought this looked so cute! I was so excited to receive it! Do NOT Order this! The arms are the size of pencil stixs! I am not a huge person fairly petite I ordered a medium and it would have fit if I could of gotten my arms through the sleeves! Totally weird fit! Also the fabric looked like a cool comfy material however it is a yuck HOT like polyester type of material! Not good for hot weather however I will never know because I can not even put my arms through the holes to put it on! Sending back although it is probably from China!
1.0,It was a kinda cute for a minute..then it broke.
1.0,"Very disappointed that the dress I received had clearly been worn and returned. It had an ungodly odor to it and there was no tag attached. When I checked the care instructions tag in the inside it looked old and worn. I previously ordered a very similar dress in a pattern color same company that had a tag attached, no odor, was obviously new unworn. Didn’t expect to receive the second dress in this unacceptable quality"
1.0,"For a medium, this shirt is very small.... Fits very tight and is too short. I would have to order a large to get my fit."
1.0,I thought these were super cute style wise. I wore them to the pool and had them on top of my head (84 degrees outside) and the lenses warped out of the frames. I've never had that happen before even with the super cheaper sunglasses I've purchased. It wasn't even that hot out. I wouldn't buy these ever again and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
1.0,"The product is no good, feels like plastic. Product has warning. That it can cause cancer. Why put such a product on the market, that may do harm. No good, I through it away. I would not let my grand aunt wear something that could hurt her. Disappointed customer"
1.0,"These jeans run very small and short. I normally wear size small but I sized up to a medium and they barely fit. I'm not even that tall (5'3, 124lbs) but these only go down to my ankles. These would look cute if they were baggy and actually resemble the pic of the person wearing the jeans that the seller posted to the description. Unfortunately they look like the 2nd pic. They did not look flattering when I tried them on.. I've also uploaded a picture of the jeans I received so you guys can see for yourselves. Oh and the hole for the button is sealed so I had to cut it myself. Definitely not worth the price. I'm very disappointed. Order them at your own risk."
1.0,"The inside foot bed is like sand paper.  If you add the insert, included,  then your foot can't get in shoe.  Loved the look at the shoe, but not if cant wear it."
1.0,The product just isnt as advertised and 99% of the time I would return these but I needed them for hunting and they are one of the best fits and feels for glasses I ever had. Just wish they worked...
1.0,"The inner coat and outed only connect at the zipper. My 7year old decided returning it would be better because it is so hard to keep it together when taking it off. Looks like a nice coat, just isn't can't believe they didn't have a connector at the end of the sleeves."
1.0,I was not happy with it.
1.0,The watch was defective...one side didn't come with a side silver piece. Maybe look at it before packing it.
1.0,At first I thought that my purchase might’ve been a cold shoulder sweater but the rip is under your arm it’s not on your shoulder it’s a complete rip through the entire sleeve of the sweater unbelievable
1.0,"I bought this pouch to specifically keep my passport dry, as their description implied was possible.  However once the pouch arrived I found that was not possible to get the passport into the sealed area without great effort that will leave the passport bent, folded and mutilated.  The passport will fit in the pouch in several other places but not in the ultra water tight compartment as I had been expecting."
1.0,As depicted but didn't fit
1.0,Too small and very uncomfortable
1.0,"Seller managed to get my original one star review removed, I guess it’s because I used the word China.  Anyway just know this, these glasses smell really bad, I think it’s because the chemicals used to set the plastics in the nose pads and temple arms are probably substandard.  I have to wonder with the smell as bad as it is, if this thing is safe to have anywhere near anyone’s nose, eyes or even your face."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money!! There is not a place for their thumb, as shown. Just a place to put their whole hand. I can use a sock instead"
1.0,I ordered a 2X as I am a full figured woman and it is not a true 2X it is more of a XL.  It is made well a very pretty but way to small.  Will fit good if I lose 100 lbs.
1.0,I like the look and the comfort. They were just too small.
1.0,They keep falling off. They don't attach to your ear correctly.
1.0,doesn't even fit up my legs!!!!
1.0,Advertised as Chiffon... but is really cheap net... not as advertised..wouldn't buy it from him again!
1.0,Tooooo small? I thought it was for a key change
1.0,"This is a good looking 56 mm watch... but, that’s where it stops. I had it only one month and one day the band just broke and it just fell off my arm while I was driving. The light for nite use is so weak it should be shipped with a case of candles and a case of matches. Be advised... run from this piece of salvage."
1.0,I counted 47 charms but not one is a virgo . iam highly upset and displeased with the product for one im a virgo yall couldve atleast have 1 virgo charm in the pack even though i was supposed to get 4 of each meaning 4 virgo charms.
1.0,"The bands came off the sides at the first wash, the skirt is too short and very thin with no support. Fit too small even though I ordered a size up. The stitching is untidy and the general feel is that the material and production is very poor."
1.0,"Extreme too small.  No use in returning, I just gave it away."
1.0,"Total joke, so small they would not an infant."
1.0,Don’t know if it suppose to come with the bottom piece detached but I have to see if I can put it on the pearl ball. Hopefully it will be useful. The chain link is not what I expected. Truthfully I got it because in the picture it looked like the chain was a rhinestone chain but it isn’t. The chain looks like a small version of large links. Not very classy looking. So we’ll see. Won’t be purchasing another like it.
1.0,"I bought these based on another review about fitting thick rimmed glasses, but they were too small for my glasses, plus the clips were not spaced far enough apart to reach both lens at the same time.  So they were not usable for me.  I think they need to make another size larger of these clip-on glasses.  These are medium sized, it appears."
1.0,I didn’t like that it’s too tight on the waistband and loose on the stomach part.  Doesn’t hold stomach in.  I have similar style pink leggings that are much mor comfortable as they don’t have that tight band around the waistline.
1.0,The pants run small.
1.0,"Strangest color shade I've ever seen! Nothing like the picture on Amazon.  Couldn't possibly call it dark cranberry...maybe washed out brown/beige/ something.  The bag itself is great..Previously I  purchased a Cyan Blue, which is actually blue and  I love that bag."
1.0,"This is not a dress but more like a slip,  made from extra material leftover from a different project.  Nothing like the pictures from other reviewers."
1.0,"Super cheap, after only 3 uses, the inner thigh area started deteriorating.  I weigh 120lbs."
1.0,So I bought these jeans and I was stupid and thought that they would be EXACTLY like the picture. Because I  wanted them to be tighter on the hip and upper thighs and baggy knees down but the entire thing is too baggy and I regret not getting a smaller size. Probably will be returning it.
1.0,"Unfortunately, it came broken. It was poorly made."
1.0,"zipper broke not even 4 months after purchase, it kept sticking & catching on the material inside & now the teeth broke even though I was extremely gentle in trying to fix it. really disappointed in this product!"
1.0,It broke on the first day
1.0,These did not wash well and unlike most Rene Rofe pj’s they are not great quality or soft. The embroidery shrinks with first was leaving them looking odd.
1.0,"Gave this to my sister for her bday and it broke the next day! How embarrassing for me, looks beautiful but I’m so disappointed in the quality"
1.0,nose and face<br />Look like monkey
1.0,"Product is not as described. The product is described as 100 pieces, but when I added it to cart, it switched to 50 pieces. After 50 arrived and I reviewed my purchase, I saw the 50 listed. I thought I might have made the error but when I went through the process again as if I was making another purchase, it switched To 50 once added to cart. Dishonest practice."
1.0,Finally arrived (supposedly mailed in October) in package so battered I thought the contents had fallen out.  These earrings are shorter than the posts -- well under 1/2 inch..  They are secured by the tiniest plastic stops I have ever seen.  Anyone with larger hands than mine couldn't handle them (I wear the smallest glove size they make for women.)  They are so small you can't even tell they are cats.
1.0,Broke in the first week.
1.0,The product is cheaply made
1.0,"Save your time and energy, DONT BUY! The material is extremely sheer and see though"
1.0,Posts would not fit through my piercing
1.0,This is so poorly portrayed.... that is for my wasted money!
1.0,Broken item
1.0,When I opened the box the small metal part that goes through the bel holes was loose in the box.  I made a contact through Amazon to the vendor three days ago and agin this morning but I have not had a reply.  I do not want a replacement as the belt is not well made.
1.0,The garter is not attached well to the shorts and gets warped and twisted around. Not good at all.
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this cheap outfit!! No stars however couldn’t submit a review without choosing a star
1.0,Definitely not worth the money I paid for them. They don’t even sit on your nose correctly! I think they are misshaped! What a terrible disappointment! They look nothing like the advertisement!
1.0,"Ordered for me, this skirt is too small for my 10 yr old to wear.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Silver chipped off
1.0,Very poor quality. Super thin. Not what I was expecting at all. I’m even scared to wear it and it ripping. Awful
1.0,I am 6ft 275 and not a small guy and thats why i ordered 3XL. It fits very tight like an xl. Returning waste of time!  SIZE MATTERS!
1.0,Bottom fit very small for size
1.0,They do not d have any memory foam in them.  Not worth the price.
1.0,No back picture!!!
1.0,The shirt unfortunately does not look as nice or like the shirt in the pictures.
1.0,No me gusto la calidad de la impresión
1.0,Holes after 3 months of normal wear by my 7 year old.
1.0,"Arrived all scratched, looked like a used item..gave it as gift and it looked six months old.  Very unhappy"
1.0,The material is rough. Feel like stepping on sand papers. Would not recommend.
1.0,Was completely dissatisfied with the product. Was purchased for a family member who got a size LARGER just in case and it's still WAY too tight! horrible sizing and horrible bathing suit in general.
1.0,"Doesn’t stay locked in place, will only stay on for a few seconds!"
1.0,Not like the picture at all they sent solid black with very large flare legs. I won’t order from this company again very deceptive practices.
1.0,did not receive all the pieces
1.0,Ripped under armpit after first wash
1.0,I bought one from the local Pandora store and the clasp came off the leather the second day. We took it back and exchanged for another and the clasp came off of the second within a few days. This was a birthday gift for one of my daughters who has always take exceptional care of her jewelry type items. I'm very very disappointed in the lack of quality in these light blue leather bands with the special edition clasp.
1.0,I waited for almost two weeks for this thing to come. I opened up the box when it came and this was what was in the box: Casio AQS810W-1A2V Solar Ana-Digi Sports Wrist Watch. Why?
1.0,"I understand it was likely NOT the fault of the seller, but this pin arrived broken. And though it wasn't obvious from the photo, it was cheaply made. [Perhaps I should have known that from the price.]"
1.0,The shape of these is so weird. It looks like it was more made for a dog than a tiny human. Do not recommend.
1.0,"Thin, flimsy fabric"
1.0,"I loved this dress when it arrived, fit nice, though a bit larger than expected. As soon as I washed it a giant hole appeared where the tie is. Its unravelling as we speak... very upset."
1.0,"I bought these shoes to accompany a gift for my niece. Thankfully, I decided to have them sent to me so I could wrap them first. I can't begin to tell you what poor shape these were in. The pink leather was coming off in spots all over both shoes and both soles had spots on the side where they were bunching out. There is no way Lelli Kelly would allow such poor workmanship. These must either have been fake Lelli Kellys or factory rejects. Sorry but I'll pay full price for my Lelli Kelly shoes from now on and buy them from Nordstrom....At least them I know I'm getting the quality I paid for!!!!!"
1.0,Item arrived broken
1.0,"These pants are not true to size, I ordered extra large I am 14/16 and are the size of a child."
1.0,Did not pay attention to the details and only looked at the pics. It’s not cotton and lace but a printed nylon. Not at all what we thought this would be.
1.0,When they came in. They didn’t look right.<br />After day 1. Both bracelets unraveled.<br />So far only got refund for 1.<br />Hope they do right thing and give me my other refund.
1.0,"When I first got the sticks, a friend who has the identical ones had a difficult time getting mine together, unlike her own.  I never folded them afterward because it took way too long to have them opened.  Earlier this month, at Red Rock, CA in the Mojave I was with a group going up three mountains and then a mostly rocky 9 mile trail.  On #2 mountain, the middle part got wobbly and then collapsed.  It was useless.  On #3 mountain, my other stick did the exact same thing.  I now had two useless sticks to carry.  At break time, friends used a mix of two straight twigs, duct tape, electrical tape and zip ties to make one useful stick from two broken ones.  I would have been in a dangerous situation had it not been for the group ingenuity to improvise  . I've tried writing POG since the incident and no one replies.  Please tell me how to talk with Customer Service."
1.0,Had to return. It ran small and poor quality.
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE! Cheap, cheap, cheap! These boots are just ugly. They were shipped in a bag and smell like rubber!  As soon as I took them out of the package stuff was falling off of them. I don’t  even know what the black piece is on one of the boots but it was sewn into the boot! They are NOT white, not even off white really but more like a light tan. They look like they are made of rubber and/or cheap plastic. I waited a month for these and boy what a disappointment."
1.0,Cheap product!  Junk!
1.0,No just no don’t buy if you actually have boobs. I have a 34DD. The bottoms are ugly too
1.0,They should call the SCRAPulas.<br />They fell apart in a very short time.
1.0,"The item that was shipped was not as pictured.  I wanted the pockets in the ""front"". This had side pockets, which just simply add to my hips!<br />I picked this style for the front pockets.  The material is very thin and overall look is more like pajamas than a top.  I will keep it, just to wear around the house with leggings."
1.0,"Ordered 100% cotton pajamas per the description. Not only did I receive different colors/patterns than ordered, the pajamas I received are 35% cotton, 65% polyester."
1.0,This material is like cheap halloween costume. I can’t imagine working out in the tanks and have it moisture wicking. Would not buy again.
1.0,The words were not even centered in the front of the cap. Absolutely no care given in making this cap. Nonexistent quality control.
1.0,Cheaply made from China
1.0,I just recently put this dress on for first time within 10 minutes the string around the neck broke and frayed like it was never tied just braided and so now I'm left with a $30 dress I can't even wear.... I have no way of contacting the seller I have tried so don't waste your money..
1.0,I thought it looked really nice and felt nice yet on the first time that I wore it the clamp broke off of the bracelet with no pressure whatsoever. I was astounded at how easily it just fell apart. I would never buy this again.
1.0,So bad quality
1.0,The fit is nothing like the pictures. Very disappointed. You can get better cheaper ones at Walmart.
1.0,I bought two of these and they both fell apart after washing once. Huge waste of money.
1.0,I received this shirt and the first one was WAY to small. Ordered the next size up. Fit okay but when I put it on the sequence fell off all over the place.
1.0,"We purchased this ring for my fiance instead of the tungsten carbide ring that he had his eye on. We researched the ceramic bands and read that they were very similar to the tungsten carbide. Unfortunately, even though the amazon page for this ring claims&#34;Highly resistant to scratching&#34;, this ring scratched the first day, and very easily. Enough of a ridge that my fingernail can click on it. Very disappointed and we are back to square one looking for a ring."
1.0,"Irregular sizing! Both are a size MEDIUM, but the Black tank is clearly smaller. I normally wear a size SMALL and the blush colored Med fits perfectly, but the black was extremely tight and did not fit over my chest! I would need an XL for the black next time."
1.0,"I ordered a 3X (I usually wear a 1X), just because I like my robes to be big and roomy.  It's like I am wearing a M.  Only positive is that it's forcing me to exercise so that I can actually close the robe and tie it."
1.0,"The arm holes are too large, bra shows under arms. There is only a very short sleeve. I would wear it in my house, but not in public."
1.0,"Way too big, also so slippery, my kiddo kept falling in them. Cute, but not functional."
1.0,"Horrible horrible horrible, poor for making, need to make over."
1.0,This is more of a rain coat with a hood than a hoodie. Not at all what I was expecting. 👎🏽 Definitely not for cold weather!
1.0,"Maybe it's me, but the necklace I received is MUCH smaller than advertised. It's cute. You can't really see the different colors on the unicorn"
1.0,"When I bought this set of three, I was excited because it was only a couple of dollars more than one individual pair.  However, I've worn the Thor pair once, and laundered them, and now each one has a hole in the top of the sock.  Not even in the sole where you might expect wear and tear, but the top!  After ONE wear.  I'm very disappointed.  They are very cheaply made."
1.0,"The sleeve ended up going to my elbow, but it was sewd so tightly I couldn't get my arm threw it, total fail."
1.0,To tight in the size my pup usually wears.
1.0,"These are very misleading.  This is not a full size belt.  The picture looks like it is but when you look at ALL the photos it is a very short section of a belt.  Does not fit a full waist this fits a section of your pants, like between 2 or 3 belt loops.  I had previously purchased a full belt and obviously didn’t look closely at this just relied on the picture so shame on me for not knowing what I purchased.  I prefer the one that fastens on the first belt loop and wraps around the full back of pants finishing at the other belt loop in front."
1.0,Jacket is too small and I do not even know how to return it. I also purchased a second jacket that was too small.
1.0,never got it to work
1.0,CHEAP! IT BROKE AS SOON AS I PUT IT ON MY LEG.
1.0,too small for my head - sent it back
1.0,"Terrible, see-through, crappy material! Not worth the money!"
1.0,"No vale la pena la inversión, después de muy poco tiempo se tendrá que desechar y hacer basura."
1.0,They are too big on me...
1.0,"Please do not order black, it’s looks nothing like the photo that’s showing!! ☹️☹️☹️"
1.0,I wasn’t satisfied with this purchase. They remind me of a pair of thermal underwear. I don’t wear pajamas outside so they are just loungewear. I could get away with the top and a pair of shorts but they are NOT worth the money. They aren’t anything for casual wear or outside Period….
1.0,The silver came off just by me bending it slightly to put into the hole and it didn't even go through. Underneath the silver was copper this is what we call a waist of time effort and hard earned money.
1.0,It looked more like a night gown or potato sack
1.0,These felt like a ballon. The material was so weird.
1.0,"This is the same visor you can buy from Daiso for $1.50. Cheap, hard to adjust, and not worth it."
1.0,I loved the idea of no chemicals... but it just didn't work. So disappointed.
1.0,The clasp on this band is worthless. I've been wearing this for less than 8 hours and it has fallen off over a dozen times already. Returning it will cost more than I paid for it. So it'll soon be sent to the landfill. I immediately ordered a different band.
1.0,Looked great so I put it on and within 2 hours of wear three bells fell off.<br /><br />I was in flip flops and capris so it's not like it was snagged or pulled off.
1.0,Item was not as described... the neck to this item is very short like a  regular jacket.. material is nice... also... I purchased a 2X and it still fits like a small... and I’m a 9-10 in size have to send back!
1.0,Awful material and sizing
1.0,Watch didn't work not sure if battery is dead or the watch in general is broken
1.0,stone fell out.
1.0,"Beyond being pretty, I'm very disappointed. I guess I have sensitive feet because I can feel all of the embossing on the bottom of the sole. I've had them for a few days, trying to get them worn enough, to get that broken-in feeling, and it's getting worse.<br />If you have sensitive feet, don't buy these slippers. Your feet will thank you."
1.0,Came apart in less than 30days.
1.0,a Lot thinner than expected. Doesn't fit my iphone 8+ with a cover. the snaps don't close all the way
1.0,So pretty looking but im so angry with this product. I ordered it as a Xmas gift for my mom and one of the ear ring literally fell apart in her hand as she was trying to put it on!!!<br />DON'T BUY POOR QUALITY
1.0,This dress was not anything like the picture and was missing the ribbon for the waist.
1.0,i returned these boots because it smells
1.0,"The bags are very small in size. I expected them to be larger. Therefore, I felt the one-star rating was appropriate."
1.0,"Extremely uncomfortable and not the easiest to get on. Either you pull over your head or step into and pull up,very awkward. Do not recommend for anyone with mobility problems."
1.0,The transfer on the back is not as it appears in the listing. It is barely half as big as seen in the listing.
1.0,Cheap I got what I paid for
1.0,Wouldn’t order again
1.0,"Bought two of these in different colors. The red was way shorter than the khaki one I purchased. Seemed like it was already bought, worn, washed, shrunk and then returned."
1.0,"this dress is garbage the material is cheap and poorly made, no one should spend their money buying this piece of garbage"
1.0,Way too big.  Also the pockets are extremely weird.  The fit is also weird.  Super loose until you get to the ankles.
1.0,Arrived with NO EARS! Took two weeks for the hat to arrive and when it was delivered we instantly noticed the ears were missing.
1.0,DO NOT FIT AS SIZED!
1.0,Broke the first day of wearing it. The claps detached and could not find it.. was not happy
1.0,The stocking was to small and I need to return.
1.0,"Purchased this umbrella, as tired of ""disposable umbrellas"" and this one had the Sharper Image brand.  Carried this around in my car for years - the first time I needed it, it got me to the building - and when I tried to shake off the rain before folding it up, it turned partially inside out, never again to be used (no gusts of wind involved).  So much for the Sharper Image brand name - just another disposable umbrella."
1.0,Does not look like what it does in the picture.. very disappointed. I have returned the product
1.0,"It says large blanket scarf, but is much smaller than in the picture. Less than half the size actually."
1.0,Would not stay on ear!
1.0,Another piece of Chinese junk.
1.0,The shoe horn fell apart and no longer usable
1.0,"The fit is short and boxy, too wide even though I ordered down a size.  The green is a lovely emerald color.  Unfortunately, the blouse smells like dust and mildew.  I am returning it to the thrift shop it came from."
1.0,"The zippers on the two that I bought fell apart, you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Update.<br /><br />After my negative review of this watch band, they sent me one to replace the broken one. Less than 2 weeks now, and it fell apart again. What the hell.<br /><br />Poor design and construction. Purchased this band on Dec. 14, 2016. It fell apart, into peices today Jan. 16, 2017."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I ordered a size small, and even though the label said it was a small, the dress itself was enormous. Maybe they meant this was supposed to fit a small elephant, and not a person? I was absolutely swimming in fabric and had to return it."
1.0,"La tela es muy barata, no es lo que yo esperaba, no está bien cosido"
1.0,"Producto de mala calidad, las tallas no son las correctas, no vale la pena comprar este producto"
1.0,One size does not fit all. It’s way too big
1.0,So I ordered this for the shape of Maryland and what arrived was so poorly made I couldn't even give it as the gift I had gotten for my friend
1.0,Putting it in and it broke it was so thin
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. There is a seam running diagonally from the zipper to the bottom left side for absolutely no reason.
1.0,The hat is very flimsy. Won’t keep its shape at all
1.0,No he recibido mi pedido donde esta
1.0,"Very cute but broke after wearing them TWICE. I’m not happy, i don’t recommend"
1.0,It is not a floor mat at all it is big enough for your hand. Horrible buy. So tiny!!!!! DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE!!!!!!!
1.0,Arrived wrinkle!
1.0,BEWARE!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Like others have said in their reviews these earrings don't last long before they are trash. The ball unattached from stem on BOTH after hardly no time of having and wearing. So disappointing and doesn't need to be sold completely. Especially for 10 dollars. You'd be better off buying similar earrings from your local beauty supplier for $2.99.
1.0,After I sing it once while doing dishes it started to split apart immediately!! I paid $25 and it didn’t last a Day!! It wasn’t too small and I didn’t even wear it tightly! I regret this purchase and want my money back. Pictures are all the proof you need!
1.0,This is not the comfortable material. Don’t be fooled by photo
1.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift.  The lights didn't work and one of the infinity stones fell out.  Had to hot glue it back in place. was able to finally get the lights to work.  Also, the plastic/vinyl is VERY stiff.  Kids can hardly move it."
1.0,Looked fake and clunky.  Was looking for something that looks &#34;real&#34; and classy.
1.0,I'm thinking it was an xl in juniors.
1.0,Mala calidad en elaboración. La suela del calzado del pie derecho vino con una deformación. Posee una burbuja de aire en la suela. El niño se queja de el pie sele hunde cuando pisa con el pie derecho. Recibi el pedido en miami y luego reenvie a Venezuela con un Courier. No es fácil ni barato hacer la devolución 25$ arrojados a la basura
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo. Sleeves are way too short. Sits right at the waist. Material is super thin and cheap. Cheap snap buttons. Ordered a small. I'm 5 5 113lbs sleeves are about 3 inches above the wrist
1.0,"Just got these, the first day I  wore them they broke in less than 5 minutes but I guess I get what I pay for."
1.0,I wore these for about 7 months until now the mirror coating has started flaking off. The lenses were never scratched or damaged in any way. They were gently cleaned with a microfiber cloth. Despite being extremely careful the coating is flaking after minimal use. I know they aren't Raybans but 50 dollars is a lot of money for sunglasses that don't even last a year. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,shirt was shaped like a box
1.0,Bows are all crushed. Nothing is making the wrinkles come out of the ribbon. Funny smell. Should send them back.<br /><br />I’ll give them one star because the ribbon is pretty. They would have been nice had they arrived in better condition.
1.0,"I really wanted to like these. They're a bit flimsy and fit my face wide but those I can live with. Hoelwever, these arrived scratched up. Right out of the plastic I could see it. It's really hard to catch it in a picture because of the mirror lens but I sent pictures of the ones I could get to show up. There are more however."
1.0,Very thin. Poor quality.
1.0,It shrunk so much after one wash
1.0,"I’m seriously debating on whether or not to keep this bra. I like it, and it’s adhesiveness is great, but OH IT STINKS!!! What is this horrible smell?? It smells like bad fish. I tried washing it, but the stink is still there. I tried perfume last night, but the second you take it off, the horrific fish smell is back. I just may return it and try a different one."
1.0,It says for infant but it fits my 8 year old.there's NOTHING out there to protect a infant.don't fall for it. Baby is too small to have a shield
1.0,This product is soo small. I had to give the large Capri yoga pants to a friend that wears a size 2. DO NOT ORDER unless you are tiny.
1.0,"Not as pictured.  Pants were brown and tan, not black and tan as pictured.  Top was black with brown and tan trim around the neck.  Did not go well together at all!  Ordered Medium Petite.  Pants were huge and at least 6 or more inches too long.  Top ran short."
1.0,Made my boobs look weird so never have used. Waste of money
1.0,This dress is my daughter's dream dress for prom. It is beautiful but a little too big. I often buy clothes online and know how to take measurements and if there is a sizing chart I always take new measurements. I ordered according to the chart but this dress was tied as tightly as it could be. It might as well have had a zipper. I requested a return so that I could buy a size smaller. NO LABEL HAS BEEN SENT FOR THE RETURN!!! DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO GET STUCK WITH IT.
1.0,I just opened this dress and it had a split up the back. The shipping was quick. But now I have to take it to someone to fix it I don't want my ass out.
1.0,This item was purchased for my spouse these are her responses and reviews of it.
1.0,It was broken when I received it. I threw it away.
1.0,Cheaply made. Too loose. No compression whatsoever.
1.0,The magnet that holds the bracket together is very weak.  Keeps falling off my wrist and the snap is not a good fit too.
1.0,The band is cheaply on. From the reviews I thought this would be a good one for my elderly patient bit by the next day the band broke off. It's not stitched on.
1.0,Took too long to get here and way too big
1.0,"This isn’t even the right necklace that I received! And it’s SILVER when I ordered GOLD! I counted on this to wear to a work party, and now I don’t have anything"
1.0,"Both arrived damaged. One had one of the chains unattached at one end, and the one I bought for mom had the lace ripped. Not worth the money. I may as well use the parts I can salvage off the ripped lace in a different necklace for mom to get some value out of it."
1.0,"Fits good, comfortable, breatheable, nice colors, great variety<br />I enjoy everything except for the padding. I feel like the only reason for a bra is for the padding but it easily gets damaged and the material for the padding is super cheap. They’re falling apart. After laundry, I always have to readjust the padding because they flip and crinkle horribly (even when I put it in delicate hand washing bags).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I can’t use these bras anymore because of the damaged padding and it is such a hastle to keep fixing it after each wear. When I now wear it, it looks lumpy and makes my chest look strange. These bras are not designed to last. I will not purchase again."
1.0,Doesn’t fit. It’s too big.
1.0,Movin too late for Christmas and was too small. Company at least refunded it.
1.0,This watch band is very flimsy.  Not as nice and heavy as it looks in the pictures.  Will return.  Won’t last long.
1.0,So huge! It's came with a spots on a front like someone is wear this top before.<br />Retuned
1.0,This produce is much smaller than stated.  It makes a better bracelet than an anklet.  The chain is of a delicate nature well<br />suited for a fashion statement rather on the plain side.
1.0,This is plated and it rubbed off within days<br /> I'm pretty saddened by that because it was beautiful and I lived it.
1.0,"Very thin material! Not at all what I expected! Maybe I should have ordered up a size, but still not sure if I’d like it!"
1.0,"This material was so thin and see-through that the shirt was unwearable, even with an undershirt. Not at all as pictured. Maybe this was a knock-off? The darker colors were okay, but the white is a big no-go, unless you're in to showing off your anatomy. Despite the misleading photo, the seller still did not cover return shipping. The description of their return policy said ""free returns,"" but apparently that meant free to them. Weeks after the seller had received my return, I still had to badger them for a refund before they issued the credit. After covering the shipping cost and the couple months of headache that the whole ordeal demanded, I will definitely not be purchasing in the future."
1.0,The gold is more yellow than rose gold
1.0,If i spend more than 20 dollars on a dress i expect the material to be thick enough to NOT BE SEE THROUGH. Plus its baggy. Which probably is a good thing because its supper thin material.<br /><br />Not worth the purchase.
1.0,"The flowers are huge!  The clasp is cheaply made so you have to force it closed but with the flowers being so big and heavy, it surely won't hold long."
1.0,I got a bracelet from the package.
1.0,"Ok i am 5'9"" and 140 lbs so fairly tall and lean and let me tell you this dress made me look like 40 pounds heavier. It does not flatter your curves it adds them in weird places. Pockets are very bulky and unflattering. Matieral is nice though"
1.0,The material is the most uncomfortable I've ever had in a bra.  In less than an hour my skin was so irritated by it that I couldn't wear it anymore.  It's just so rough.  There was also pretty much no support at all.  The bra kind of covers the area its supposed to but that's about it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:eecd29fa26695013a972088f3ea2dfa3]] This is the most not durable piece of luggage i’ve ever bought. There’s a hole after one time use. I bring other luggages too and they were fine.<br /><br />Lipault, i love the color but how can you make a luggage so fragile?<br /><br />I am not sure if i can return this since now its used and i am overseas."
1.0,Really cute and I loved it but it broke within a week.  :(
1.0,"I plan to return them, the lense color is darker than expected and they are stretched."
1.0,"Cheap, glass beads. Not worth the price."
1.0,"Too large,  the pants are different color than the original are.  Very cheaply made."
1.0,"Not a high quality dress, you can see through the underwear"
1.0,Broke right off the bat.
1.0,"So pretty but they’re not what they seem… I never sleep in my jewelry, and I only had these for a month, it’s past my return date so I’m stuck with them. I wouldn’t buy these again…."
1.0,Not worth it!
1.0,"This ring guard is only 1mm across, so your ring would have to have a band less than 1mm wide for it to work. Also, the prongs are both on the same side, so if you had this impossibly narrow band, it would fall off anyway. I didn't notice that the prongs were both on one side, and the size is not indicated except with a rather deceptive picture."
1.0,Ordered up to have room. Usually 3 sizes smaller. Larger size didn't go over knees.
1.0,Item came way smaller than the size chart. I always purchase one to two sizes bigger and it still was not correct. Also the colr should have been red and green. It is orange not red. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I needed to wear to an event.
1.0,Very expensive for the size and amount you receive. More like trial or sample size.
1.0,Poor quality...5 sizes too small.
1.0,Misshapen and cheap. My 4 year old hated them as they were not comfortable. The stick on items broke immediately too. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Our son loves the characters, but they just don't last more than 3 months."
1.0,Product fell apart.
1.0,strap broke while wearing it the 2nd day.  Don't waste your money
1.0,"No traía su cinturón, fea caída,"
1.0,Not comfortable. They did into the back of your heal.
1.0,Terrible hat. The zipper separated as soon as I tried to tighten the hat up. I threw it in the trash!
1.0,"This necklace it’s supposed to be silver, and the chain got all black after 3 days of use."
1.0,"Looks good, sadly it never seats in and locks to the watch. Through countless efforts neither side will stay secured."
1.0,"Doesnt look as nice as photos, is more plastic material and is just a rectangle."
1.0,It was too loose and could not make it tighter. Bummer because it was very pretty.
1.0,"Purchased this purse, on sale for $212, believing it was leather.  True Saffiano is textured leather from Italy.  The purse, originally listed at nearly $400- was available for this amazing price?  Except, it is not leather but vinyl which was clear upon arrival.  I returned the purse (In my mind, synthetic is not worth $212, much less over $300). Beware, many of our major companies, now use synthetic Saffiano without making that clear."
1.0,"The plastic leather is uncomfortably thin and cheap, the bag has absolutely no structure to it (It folds into itself), the stitching looks like it's going to pop out through the fabric (kind of how the stitching looks like when you accidently try on clothes a size too small), the strap came in the package missing a metal clasp, and the zipper is so overly long yet doesn't even cover the whole opening of the purse. I would feel so uneasy if i put my wallet and phone in this purse because of the fear of it falling apart while I'm walking outside. I would probably excuse the quality of it if it was half the price, but the bag just screams fast fashion product. So sad because I was so excited to use it the moment it arrived, but instead, I'll probably be returning it."
1.0,The zipper on the left-hand pocket broke after the first wearing. Junk!
1.0,"Received my watch band today. I am almost certain it is not leather. It looks cheap, feels cheap and requires the skills of an auto mechanic to install. It is not being returned to Amazon nor are they in any way responsible for this highly over rated item. I would submit actual cost of manufacture is less than seventy five cents with an additional twenty five cents for highly suspect glowing reviews of this product. Now where is that trash can?"
1.0,"Got one as a Christmas gift. Lightweight and not durable for even moderate wear, starting to fray and seams are coming apart. Felt awkward with my gear and my daughter said it was “too geeky”. Material gave off an off-smell, but not sure if it came that way. Thankful it was a gift because I wouldn’t pay good money to buy one."
1.0,"It's just awkward, fits awkward and the sizing is all over the place. The cups are funny shaped and make ur chest look really weird. No, it's just a no"
1.0,too bulky and makes my shades fall of my ears
1.0,Does not charge my jacket even though my jacket was on the list.
1.0,"Bought this for wife in March, 2021.  She liked it and i would give it more stars for that.  However, in Sept, 2021 she gave it back to me and said it had stretched out (no she had not lost weight).  I contacted the merchant via amazon and after 6 weeks have not heard a thing.<br />Amazon only refunds for 30 days, which, ok, its there policy and i get that.  But for this item the merchant adds a paragraph advertising their 1 year satisfaction guaranty.<br />I sent them a second message today and hope the honor their word.  If they do, I will update this review."
1.0,"Poor quality, thin see through fabric and cut very short. I am 5’3 and it barely goes passed my hips. The style is very pretty though."
1.0,Was nice while they lasted (about 10 wears) but strap already ripped off its base so shoes are now trash. Realize they are cheap but hoped to use them more than 10 times.
1.0,broke apart before I give it out.
1.0,"Yep , great picture , great price. ... Bought before a Punta Cana vacation and as soon as I wore in the ocean , the synthetic silver look a like metal turned to rust, I left it in ocean as it was that bad.  Aware that it is cheap but there should be warnings .. Never put in salt water ocean ! Will turn to rust in 30 seconds! Could be a great purchase for kids with science projects tho !  I'm still amazed .. Scary plastic look alike stone with metal turn in rust immediately if put in salt water! Yes, seller u should respond of what you are selling of why it turns to rust within a minute in salt water !  Sad as the pictures looked so nice"
1.0,They don’t work on any device<br />Cell phone<br />iPad
1.0,False advertising. These do not change colors like true mood jewelry. Kids were very disappointed. I’d return but two have already broke.
1.0,Can't even get this over my daugher's head.
1.0,Very small super thin.  Cheap
1.0,I am 5'5 and 133lbs and I ordered a medium. It was extremely to small and too short.  I was also disappointed with the quality of the fabric. I returned it and  I would not recommend this dress
1.0,My son wore these outside one time and the sole completely separated from the shoe. Disappointing quality!
1.0,BS; Stainless steel is NOT supposed to turn your skin green!!! That's why I THOUGHT I'd ordered it. Obviously not what I received.
1.0,"Lovely and an eye catcher.  I mean my eye, others probably notice too, but it reminds me to let om reverberate through me.  ...all of that is true until the silver rubs off"
1.0,These leggings initially felt fine but within 5 min. they were sagging.. By 15 min they had stretched to fit an 8 foot tall person.<br />There is NO such thing as one size fits all. This was a waste of my money. If you want to wear very  saggy leggings..this is the pair for you.
1.0,"The fabric is soooo thin, I thought it might be worth the inexpensive price for just under skirts, but no...it's just too cheap."
1.0,Not for kids...way to big.
1.0,This shirt's fabric is too thin and one size smaller than stated. Not happy at all.
1.0,Was not the product shown in the photos.  It also had some missed stitches which exposed the insulation.  Cheaply made and will wear out very quickly.  Also costs more to ship back from th US than it originally cost.
1.0,4X is rather small!
1.0,"Package arrived, but without sunglasses.  This is the second time this has happened."
1.0,"The worst nightmare screen protector.<br />Do not buy the product! I do not recommend.<br />If you want to have a clean looking cell phone with the protection, do not buy this!<br />You will definitely disappoint."
1.0,They are way too small and tight. I'm a size L and they weren't a good size for me.
1.0,"Not the same pants in the photo. The checker on the side is the same and the checkers on top, BUT they're not high waisted, they flair and the bottom, the material is thin and the seams are already popping. They aren't worth it."
1.0,Fabric is confining and yet loose so it makes your body look lumpy almost
1.0,"Although I usually like Foster Grant and they being a major name brand I was surprised the frame broke after 6 months. The frames are fairly thin which was surprising, being Foster Grant .  Good thing they no longer available"
1.0,Was really looking forward to getting this dress.  I bought it 2 sizes larger so it could be loose and comfortable for summer. It was so tight.  Definitely not what I thought I was ordering.  Don't buy this dress.  The underslip was also way too short.
1.0,"I returned this item because upon receipt, it was such low quality. The knit job was so awful you could see your skin through the sweater. It was like fishnets. Definitely didn't look as pictured."
1.0,"This watch did not work. I ordered a replacement which arrived within a few days, but again,it did not work! Will now request a refund."
1.0,Do not recommend.
1.0,These are at least 5 sizes too small.
1.0,"The necklace was so incredibly tangled, it took me 45 minutes to get it untangled!! It seems pretty but that almost ruined it for me."
1.0,Thong cut into space between toes.
1.0,Had these Exactly 1 month. Just now they broke where the lens attaches to the bridge. I love them but I’m not willing to buy another pair.
1.0,This dress was completely shear.
1.0,"I don’t like the product because it not run good, it stop all the time, run little bit and stop, run little then stop. If I wear it for couple day. It stop run I will return it"
1.0,"Very cute but after using 6 of the pairs, my first use, the balls stripped so the balls no longer attach... Others after leaving in !y cartlage over night the balls would loosen and fall off...."
1.0,"Ordered one size over,that turned out OK but width is so narrow I can only stand to where them for a half hour."
1.0,To small of a size tried to make it work but they was to small waste of money
1.0,"Too big, and they wouldn't take them back.  I gave them away"
1.0,I ordered one with a black hood an got one with a grey hood also doesn't look like the photo at all
1.0,"This wallet came in a timely fashion, but it is not like how it looks in the picture!  After the holiday I am going to call to see if I can get my money back or to exchange it for the correct wallet.<br /><br />First of all there is NO DRAWSTRING on the wallet, which cheapens the look.  Also,  it is a two toned wallet (on the outside of the wallet) one of the lapels is a light teal color, which is not shown on this picture.  The color itself is not the same as it is pictured.  Instead of it being a green teal it is more of a dark bluish teal.<br />The snake print in the picture looks nice, but in person it looks VERY cheap.  Think K-mart sale rack 70% off.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to give this item as a gift to someone, let alone use it for my own personal use.<br /><br />Buyer beware."
1.0,Supposed to come with 5 only came with 4
1.0,"The first time I wore this bracelet, it broke. After getting it fixed, the second time I wore it, one of the stones fell out. Pretty bracelet but very cheaply made. I would not suggest buying this."
1.0,"Pictures don’t match the product, don’t order from these people you’ll be disappointed"
1.0,I always put a tempered glass on my phones and this was the worst yet.  It was easy to apply but slid around my phone like crazy. It didn't make it past half an hour of being used.
1.0,Very crooked seams. Quality is low. Considering returning
1.0,Zipper gers stuck
1.0,Junk. Looks cheap.
1.0,This is sadly the worst shoe I have ordered. It’s hard hollow plastic that is not only uncomfortable but really loud when you walk. On top of being too wide in the fabric so it won’t stay in my foot. Don’t get them
1.0,It is awful! Cheap material and one of the sleeves is too tight! I really wasted my money and time on this product!!
1.0,Im not sure what size they sent me. I order a size 9 and the ring is very small.
1.0,To be fair my head is huge but when i order large glasses i expect them to fit which these didn't even come close
1.0,I returned it! They used the cheapest fabric to make this outfit! The pattern fades when you put it on!
1.0,"The watch I received was NOT an authentic MK, according to every website showing how to spot non-authentic MK watches. I reached out to the seller, even offering to send pictures as to why this could not be authentic. They completely dismissed me and never bothered to ask for the pictures. I then returned the watch.<br /><br />I cannot recommend buying this product. But if you do, please research how to tell the subtle differences in non-authentic MK watches! I'm glad I did."
1.0,"Opals were not intact, tried to get them repaired but opals did not fit setting."
1.0,These were terrible. Extremely flimsy and the frame is really thin. I think I got the second size and it's just too big on my face and I have a pretty large face  hahaha.  The lenses scratch so bad. The first day j for them I noticed a scratch.  And I don't even know how.
1.0,"Did not like these jeans at all. The jeans were not slim fitting. The legs on jeans were very wide, I could probably fit both legs in one pant leg on these jeans. The pic they show advertising these jeans are definitely not the jeans I ordered. Very upset customer😡"
1.0,Did not work at all
1.0,Lost my watch due to the poor design. Took off my jacket and it just came apart. So sorry I purchased this.
1.0,"- Did not come with Batteries as detailed in description.  Should be rechargeable batteries in the package but none came.<br />- Mouse was very jumpy from day 1, even when changing the resolution and the radio.<br />- Stopped working after a week.  Checked batteries, they were dead.  Placed new ones, mouse still didn't work.<br /><br />- Seller sent another mouse.<br /><br />- Once more, mouse did not come with batteries as advertised.  This was my original complaint to the seller but was not acknowledged.<br /><br />Currently looking for a replacement.  I will not buy this mouse or purchase anything from this seller again."
1.0,"I ordered a XXL however it is so small, it fits my daughter who wears a small. Quality seems to be ok but very dissatisfied with being mislead and having to return the jacket."
1.0,Not high impact at all. Also the sizing was off.
1.0,"These leggings are significantly sheer to the point where they are teetering stockings. The fit of these is so unflattering, the designs do not enhance or aid in your look, if anything they add to sheerness or uncomfortability. I’m extremely disappointed in every curvy girl review bc as someone with a large hip to waist ratio, I can’t imagine these could work for anyone."
1.0,Cheaply made. I'm disappointed. Runs very small. Looks way better in picture. Wish I hadn't bought it.
1.0,Half the lace is missing. I’m very disappointed
1.0,These pajama pants measured 20” around in a size xxl.<br />I wish they had been sized right because I really liked them.
1.0,This was a disappointing product! No one told me that it was see through.
1.0,Totally  disappointed upon receiving this dress very cheap material too expensive for the quality pictures are very deceiving
1.0,The holes for the buckle close up and frey making it very hard to use. Alos the Center buckle piece is too short and doesnt buckle properly half the time. Also the buckle edges painfully dig into my wrist. Looks nice at first but poor quality and bad design.
1.0,Was not at all what I had hoped for
1.0,"Flimsy. Only has a hook on 1 side, unlike the picture. Hook is very hard to use, hooking it only on 1 side, sometimes pops back and almost broke a rib! Also the bottom doesn't stay down, keeps popping back up.  I trashed it and got a Samsonite."
1.0,"Sorry, disappointed and had to return items.  No instructions on setting and no one of my three gurus could figure it out either.."
1.0,It's smaller than the picture....I wouldn't have gotten it if it didn't show that it covered the breast on the mannequin. But make no mistake....it is not a body chain...just a necklace.
1.0,10 weeks into school and this thing is literally coming apart at the seams. I know I didn’t pay much for it. But I at least expected to get through the semester. I was hoping to use it after school. But it looks like I’ll be buying a new tactical backpack. And this time I’ll pay more and get a good quality one.
1.0,"I plan to send these back to Amazon, because they don't look as good when I wear them, as they did on the site!"
1.0,This bag is terrible wouldn’t stand up it was very cheap made
1.0,Delivered with a dead battery smh
1.0,"The product image is very misleading. That costume is a photo of Bonk made by Matrices, which is a one of a kind hand-made costume, and definitely not for sale on amazon."
1.0,First off definitely not wide feet but that’s ok. But the quality for 45dollars is horrible I wasn’t expecting all that but these are horrible. Very weird fir as well. DO NOT BUY SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,Cute but has an awful smell. Got it outside hoping to air it out.
1.0,Purchased this in May of this year and now a few months later it stopped shocking me.<br />Ive done soft and hard reset without any luck.<br />It continues to vibrate and light up but no shock whatsoever.<br />Waste of money.<br />I wish I could give it back.
1.0,Was at least three inches shorter than advertised. Currently using to tie up a sleeping bag.
1.0,Understand it's hand made but have ordered a had made tike before much better quality.  Center plate not even centered.
1.0,"Rings do not fit, waste of my money!!"
1.0,Material not good.  very short.  not what i expected.  returning
1.0,it fell apart after a few uses
1.0,"This is not a blazer, it’s a blouse at best. I expected it to be thin material but this is a joke."
1.0,Cheaply made and already spitting apart. I do not recommend this belt. 😡
1.0,I had to reorder it because I lost the first one. :(  Hubby was sad and am waiting on the replacement.
1.0,"This broke COMPLETELY within a period of 3 days! Please, save your money. The chains are cheep, and broke. The rope things are loose, and completely let go of the charm, and i cant get it back on, unless ill end up breaking the thing more. Just dont buy this. Yeah, it looks pretty and beautiful in the picture, but, when you pay $2 for a bracelet like this, well, expect to get your money worth, and i dont think you should go to the next bracelet with different colors from the seller, because it will all be the same."
1.0,"I initially felt very comfortable but after wearing a short time, the straps seemed to stretch out causing the sandal to rub causing blisters."
1.0,3 sizes to small and see through
1.0,I like mask that aren't too thick but these are like pantyhose thin.
1.0,Not very flattering and color was a bit off
1.0,"Awful. So disappointed. I LOVED this ring. Last night I noticed two stones fell out. The one stone was slightly raised when I received the ring, but I loved it so much that I was willing to accept that flaw. I only wore this ring two days since purchasing. I’m very upset. I love this ring. I would absolutely accept a replacement. I hate that this beautiful ring has broken after TWO WEARS ONLY."
1.0,This is not leather.  It looks cheap.  Only two inside slip pockets.
1.0,"I'm a 36C Im usually M size in sports bra I ordered L/XL and it look like It would fit, I did not try it on cause it looked used on arrivle and it also was demages so I returned it"
1.0,I bought these from a retailer for my daughter for Christmas. Within a week the sparkly squares started falling off. One of her slippers has no sparkles left at all...not even a month later! The other slipper has the fur trim coming off.
1.0,"Lol,  sizing not even close...... way small. I ordered the largest,  this wont even fit my tiny 15 year old daughter who wears a size xs"
1.0,"This shirt was way smaller than expected, very disappointing. Adult XL = Child Medium"
1.0,...just no.
1.0,"These  are not a cute little accent earring, they are ENORMOUS. Don't get them unless you want them to take up your entire earlobe."
1.0,"These earrings are terrible. I took mine out of the package and they were missing a stone, never worn."
1.0,"I ordered a Small based on the reviews. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 125 lbs. it didn’t feet half of my body! Way too small!  Material feels cheap,. Will return item."
1.0,"After Reading the Reviews on how the project runs small, I went 2 sizes up and it's Still Tight!!"
1.0,I'm ordered a small that fits like a large and very high waist.
1.0,Coulsnt fit one a person who wears small medium large of or xl all fits wrong somewhere. Yes i know because it didnt fit me and i didnt want to return it so i tried multiple friends and it fit none of them.
1.0,Cheap af and horrendous
1.0,Ugliest jacket ever! It looks like an old man's windbreaker in a women's cut. On the small side...will donate to charity because it's a pain to return things. Very disappointed.
1.0,I did not like this dress at all the fabric reminds me of a shower curtain and looks like it was thrown together. The dress fit big and did not look good on at all. Not comfortable or cool made me hot and uncomfortable i am not happy with this product at all.
1.0,The material wasn’t right
1.0,This band had like ink stamps of wasps not even a bee Gucci like failed
1.0,Came with ink marks all over it! It was cheaply made
1.0,I have sensitive with earrings put these over gold studs my ears are swollen and infected didnt work for me i had high hopes
1.0,So upset... thought these would be great leggings as they are very soft and fit well. But in an hour of wearing I noticed a hole in the crotch.
1.0,"The sizing is totally incorrect.  The top is for a ""junior size""."
1.0,"Unfortunate this dress doesn’t fit the same way the picture shows. And the color grey is darker than the picture. The waist band is placed in the wrong place... so it’s not an empire waist nor is it a standard waist. It’s awkward. That with the high neck and awkward waist it looks like your torso is shortened unnaturally. Then the skirt poofs out in a funny way, creating and overall unflattering look.<br />I posted a picture... I’m 5’5 and 113 pounds. I ordered a size 6. Which is tight but fits right. Normally dresses are flattering on me... this one just makes me look pregnant. I’m returning it."
1.0,Product is visually stunning but fell apart on the second day I wore it. Complete waste of my money which was a shame cause I really liked the design.
1.0,"Very sad that these are NOT as advertised. VISCOSE is not cotton. It’s made from wood pulp. I’m sure they are very comfortable, but do not advertise as COTTON and then send a product clearly labeled otherwise."
1.0,Will not purchase or recommend. Seam goes all the way down the front of dress. I wore backwards smh washed it once and the fabric had lent balls all over. The fabric was nice and cool I love the pockets. Unfortunately I will not wear the dress unless it’s aroung the house cleaning or lounging
1.0,I washed this one time and it literally turned gray. I've never seen something Fades so fast
1.0,It is a SCAM
1.0,"Sizing is off, even going up in size."
1.0,This dress is so cheap you could only wear it as pajamas!  Even the buttons are cheap.  Would recommend NOT buying this. :(
1.0,"Weird fabric, very stiff."
1.0,Runs extremely small...bought 2 sizes bigger than my actual size and it didnt fit!!
1.0,Mad too small
1.0,"Deverian hacerle más larga la rosca donde engancha , fácil de perderce."
1.0,Size way off orderd xxl more like medium. cheep zippers and thin frabic. Not worth your money.
1.0,Looks super cheap and crappily made. Have no idea how this got a decent rating. Free product perhaps?
1.0,Sent only one size.  Order said mutual sizes.  My husband was able to cut to correct size.  Disappointed in order.  Have order from different company in past and was more satisfied.
1.0,This is just a dry sponge in this container! Didn't like.
1.0,"These are labeled 00, but they are more like halfway between 0 and 00. I put one in, and it fell out. I was hoping they just sent the wrong size, but they are labelled as 00. Because I don't want to lose them or run the risk of my ears shrinking, now I have to go through the hassle of returning them."
1.0,"Rugged but they have no ""off"" setting and don't seem very bright,  nor did they come with instructions.  I would not recommend."
1.0,"Backpack looks great, but arrived with the logo stitched on sideways. 🙁"
1.0,"Changing my review. Returning as they ripped on day one. I have never had a pair of leggings rip but these made that nightmare come true at work. Sad, I really liked them besides that."
1.0,"Do not recommend!!  They are so thin, that when you breath, they cover your nostrils and makes it feel like you’re suffocating."
1.0,It was a very adorable Grinch apron I had bought for my husband who is a huge fan of the Grinch. I gave it only one star because the product details states that it was an adult size apron. When I opened the package the Apron was clearly for a child. It was so small it didn't even fit my teenage daughter. I ended up returning it. The material also felt cheap and thin.
1.0,Junk! Wish I noticed before the return window closed :(
1.0,"When you take it out of the package it's very confusing. It looks like a sheet, nothing like the picture. Maybe it would look better with a size smaller, but I ordered my size and didn't like it."
1.0,The fabric of the dress I received is too thin to be worn without a slip or other cover beneath. It has a very bad odor which has not gone away after being washed twice.
1.0,They don't stick to surfaces very well. I returned this. They can't even hold a basic headset without loosing adhesion.
1.0,The straps broke after I put it on. I ended up just sewing them back on
1.0,"Ordered a New product, however received a used/previously opened and repackaged item.<br />There was no protection and tags on the product.<br />The product box has wear and tears.<br />Original product code was covered with a LPN RR code label."
1.0,The quality looks like it was printed into the fabric. It looks very poor quality and the color was poor as well. I bought this exact one from another company after and it looks as pictured with good quality fabric  and the item I received from this company did not look like the picture nor feel like the other one I had purchased. Save your money
1.0,"If you're short, this isn't the dress for you. I'm 5'1 about 130 pounds... sides seams were poking out and the dress came down to a few inches above my ankle. Very poorly made and poor quality material. almost see through."
1.0,I have narrow feet and could only get 3 toes under the strap. Delivery was passed the date needed
1.0,Not a belt. A cheap piece of elastic that you can't even put through belt loops.
1.0,this was for a wedding I ordered the same dress in 2 different sizes for the bridesmaids...…...the color was not the same for both dresses......you see the picture its the same dress and color …….but its not the SAME COLOR AT ALL they are two totally different shades of purple!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"These were way too small. Unfortunately, washed it first, so can't be returned! 😗"
1.0,"Flimsy and horrible smell<br />This isn't a hoodie. It's extremely thin and more like a long sleeve tshirt with a zipper and hood. The zipper kept getting snagged on the threading which was poorly sewed. Worse yet, it arrived with a horrible, horrible smell that made me gag."
1.0,Though the medium size says that it fits up to an eight and a half it only fits a size 7. I had to return these slippers and find a different gift.
1.0,"No, I was hopeful, but it didn't work AT ALL. 😢"
1.0,They were way bigger than usual.
1.0,"Not the correct size, the 5T did not fit my 3 year old,was way too small."
1.0,I returned it at a cost to myself because it was made of spandex and Lycra and way too big. I had been shopping a cotton blend. I wish they would put what clothes are made out of in an easy to find place.
1.0,"Socks looked fine when they arrived, but as soon as I picked a pair up I could tell they weren't 100% cotton.  I tried three pair but when they were washed the only one who could wear them might be a six year old boy, they had shrank so much. Why is it so hard to buy quality 100% cotton socks. All the companies I used to buy socks from have went to poly blend ( buzz words for plastic) that make your feet hot and sweaty. I wound up giving the other nine pair to the helping hands store."
1.0,Too small for me even that ordered XL.
1.0,Poor quality....definitely not as advertised
1.0,"Very tiny, can't see the kiss or lips!"
1.0,The material in the pic is WAY DIFFERENT than the material of the item I received. What I got was like the cheapest quality of thin cotton/polyester that looked like it was from Rave or Wet Seal back in the day lol
1.0,"They came torn, poor quality"
1.0,Super thin and cheaply made.  It went right in the trash not worth it.
1.0,"material very cheap. Lace falling apart. Shoulders way too big. I always wear a small, but this small was too big. I read the reviews by others saying the shoulders were too big, so I debated on buying it for a while, but then one night after drinking some wine, I decided that the dress was so pretty online I was planing to go to a seamstress to fix the shoulders. I would have gladly done so if the problem was only the shoulders. Unfortunately, this dress is beyond hope so I returned it. Don't waste your money. This dress is a mess."
1.0,I had to return due to the quality. It was very thin and see through and slightly large
1.0,There is no stretch to these at all.  I am a size 14 and I should have bought 2 pairs and sewed them together.
1.0,Not the dress totally different en XL size ☹️👎
1.0,The fit was good but after the first wash 2 holes appeared and it could no longer be worn.
1.0,It already fell apart
1.0,"I ordered a medium which was probably my first mistake because I am very small chested but regardless I am literally swimming in this top, it could wrap around my back 20 times. I’m 5’6 & 145lbs so I’m not a tooth pick but have a wider back so wanted to make sure the small wouldn’t be too small so picked a medium. The top part of it does not look cinched like it shows in the picture. It’s cheaply made. It didn’t have any reviews so I took the risk anyway but I’ll leave the first review to let you know that it’s not cute & don’t buy it lol"
1.0,Earrings all broken when received
1.0,Work.. I drive truck and some times I move freight around. Dealing with heavy skids at times. I'm placing alot of torque on my arms legs and feet. if  I don't have a solid foundation. That cld be bad.
1.0,It tore from hem as soon as I put it on poor quality
1.0,Horrible!! I ordered these rings months ago and still have not received them. I confirmed my home address and all info they requested.  All they can say is we don't know what happened to them. I wish I could give them 0 stars. DO NOT ORDER from this company!!!!
1.0,Bought before and really liked them this time seams not finished not as good quality.
1.0,Didn't use it . It was not what I expected
1.0,The safe strap broke right away.  Not sturdy at all.
1.0,The shipping was terrible.  The hat was smash and balled up which caused the had to be wrinkled and unshared.  Was very disappointing.
1.0,"This jacket is poor quality. We gave it to our daughter for Christmas and we realized when she put it on for the FIRST time, two of the snaps had already lost their reinforced backing and fallen off....before she even had a chance to wear it. It was not handled roughly at all, and even if it was, snaps on a garment should be durable enough to....well, SNAP. Do not waste your money on this product. Very disappointing to have your child get something for Christmas that is total garbage."
1.0,Color not as vibrant on picture and dress very thin
1.0,"This could have been a nice jogger set but it was not inspected and the waistband of the sweatshirt was not served properly and has a while and will get bigger if I wash it or allow my child to wear it. Returns are a hassle, it was for a gift"
1.0,"These would work for glasses worn by a chihuahua, or maybe an American girl doll. Ridiculous that they are even being sold"
1.0,"Logo doesn't look at all like the picture. Instead of a black logo, it's white(ish) with a black background. Looks terrible."
1.0,Was told it would fit a 12 year.  Measurement were wrong
1.0,Did not tame the frizz !
1.0,"Very small and not very sparkly compared to the picture. I should have read the reviews first, even for only $3, I am still disappointed.  And why did it take so long to ship something I could have bought at Target?"
1.0,got caught on my clothes
1.0,I am a medium/large and this was so tight on me - ripped  while wearing - pass
1.0,"Bought this and after wearing three of them for more than 4 consecutive days each, the stones fell out. Was really disappointed. A waste of money."
1.0,Pretty disappointing ' gave this as a gift.  Dont buy
1.0,"The softness of the material is where the stars end. I bought this two sizes too large because I wanted it to hang loose. I’m not sure who they size these articles for, Lilliputians perhaps? The thing was tiny. It was also full of uneven and dropped stitches and did not look like it would stand up to even the gentlest hand washing. I would steer clear of this one. Soft material but made so poorly you’d be regretting even spending 5 cents on it no less the price they were asking."
1.0,There was absolutely no cotton in this material. It is made of 100% synthetic fabric that feels and looks like plastic. I didn’t even bother to try it on because the description said it was mostly cotton with a little polyester. That is not true. I’m disappointed because I liked the sleeves and thought it would be a cute dress.
1.0,The sleeves were to tight at the end and to large in the shoulders. The cut of the body does not sit right. The shirt seemed messily made with strings hanging off and odd stitching. Not recommended.
1.0,Poor quality and too huge of hoops. Looked terrible with my dress.
1.0,"Item arrived on time but garment was frayed, sash was missing, sash loop was torn. I’ll-fitting and much too short (hem was 5 inches above my ankle and I am 5-8). Disappointing purchase."
1.0,The button that closes the credit card part is loose and doesn't work properly.
1.0,"I like the color combination, but it's so thick and stiff compared to the other two colors I have. I do not recommend buying the black one. The red one is a nice fitting one, so is the tan one but not the black one."
1.0,Too thin and the band is not all leather. The loops are plastic. Poor quality.
1.0,These pants shed sequins everywhere! My entire house is covered in silver sequins after wearing them. Not well made. And the silver color is much brighter than the picture
1.0,looks nice and feels nice on the wrist but falls off all the time over 12 times today alone. two thumbs down.
1.0,"These socks are ADORABLE, and if i needed long adorable socks, i’d rate these a 5, BUUUT ... They are listed as TUBE SOCKS. i NEED them to be tube socks. Tube socks do NOT have a heel; they are shaped like a TUBE."
1.0,It was too snug and too pricey
1.0,Does not fit my kids head at all. Way too big. The ear holes don’t stay in and there is a weird extra piece of material inside that just gets in the way. Have not been able to use these at all.
1.0,"Described as two pack, but only received one apron."
1.0,"Arms were small at the top of the sleeve, but baggy near your hands making it fit very odd"
1.0,"Very, very small and I used the weight sizing they provided.  Then I went to put them on him and the front clip fell apart.  Bummer.  Had to use a safety pin because it was last minute."
1.0,"This was a great belt but . . Three days after the return window closed a necessary assembly pin came loose, fell out and was lost causing the buckle to fall apart. The belt is now useless. I am very disappointed."
1.0,"The material is bunchy, too thin, and the seams are weird.  I retuned them immediately."
1.0,It doesn't fit on my pandora
1.0,Very poor
1.0,Fell apart within a week. Do not get this bracelet. It unraveled!!! Very disappointed
1.0,I ordered a large and the label said it was large but it was truly a small.
1.0,"Very cheaply made. Also the material was very thin. Even though it comes with a “belt”, does not do much. Had to return because it was just not working out for me."
1.0,Awful. Not gold color. One came damaged. Cant use. Due to wrong color returning
1.0,I was super excited about getting this swim suit because plus size suits are hard to find. I usually wear a 14/16 but saw that the seller made a note to order a size up so I ordered a 2XL. It did not fit in any way. It was too tight which I may have been able to look past but it didn't fit in the length either. The breast pads sat under my breast area and if I would have pulled the straps up it would have stretched out. I let my sister try it (she is usually a 10/12) and she had the same problem as me. The largest size is a 3XL and I honestly don't think that would fit any better. I've bought XL suits from targets junior section that fit better than this one.<br /><br />**i recieved this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.**
1.0,Too big and the seller hasn’t responded to several contacts made by me. It’s been over a month.
1.0,"For working out, I ordered M size US, since they are small sizes, change them to L size thank you"
1.0,"This dress is very fake feeling, stuff, cheap fabric with stitching issues.  I will be returning :("
1.0,Received broken and appeared to be used
1.0,This item will be returned.  We request a search of unpadded bra. It has padding and seems to run small.
1.0,The ear cuff was so cute and the recipient of this gift was really excited about it - but the first time they put it on to wear out the piece that clips to your ear snapped. Unwearable after that.
1.0,Omg...I'm so disappointed. Don't waste your money on this dress. It is not for Women.<br />I ordered a XL size it is so small my 9yr old grand-daughter can wear it.<br />I am 5'2 180lbs and can't use this dress at all but for dusting😡<br />The pic is deceiving🤥
1.0,Not what i was expecting and the dress does not flare out like the picture. Terrible quality and very small fit
1.0,I wasn't fond of it too big for my nose actually gave them away I wouldn't buy it again
1.0,"I bought this like 3 years ago for prom. To put it bluntly, the adhesive is not strong enough and AS SOON as you begin to sweat…. the bra WILL fall off. It’s truly not that sticky. I wouldn’t suggest buying this at all."
1.0,"Nothing what it looks like.  Very thin material ( only nylon ), unconstructed.  Quite large and can be used for under a plane seat since easily folded and no ribbing to keep shape  wasn't what I wanted or expected."
1.0,Very flimsy does not stay up at all. Not like what I had expected or wanted.
1.0,Very cheap look and feel .. Would be embarrassed to even give it to a child
1.0,Wasn't What I Expected...Very Disapointed..On The Picture It Looks Cute But When I Got The Shirt--The Sleeves Were Too Wide And It's Not Off The Shoulder
1.0,"Came  flat as a pancake, no way to make it look like a baseball hat, directly to garbage."
1.0,"Clearly I bought the wrong size, that’s on me.. but the shirt is NOTHING like the photo .. as you can see if the image the style is completely not right .. the color and flowers are at least. Super disappointed"
1.0,This was not genuine leather. Disappointed.
1.0,Earings were very thin metal.  Arrived in small plastic bag.  Posts were bent and broke when adjusted. Never even got a chance to wear.  Money was refunded.
1.0,"Poor quality, don’t buy this product!"
1.0,"Waist and bust true to size, but sleeve length way too short. Ended up returning it."
1.0,"Upon receipt, you get a coupon to use on their website that does not exist.  After asking about it, they said they were working on it.  I’ve used the belt for 2 months and it is coming apart already.  Hard pass!"
1.0,It is too bulky too much material was used to make this dress. The tag was sewn on the outside of the dress.
1.0,"Lettering peeled of after one wash! Which sucks cause it's very cute, very large though and cheaply made"
1.0,"These pjs were near 50$ and when they arrived they had holes on both sides of the pant leg. Stitching undone at the seams more than holes. I was gonna return them, printer won't work wich is not their problem but what a hassle. I sewed them myself but the point being if you spend that much on pjs you'd think they would go through a final check process before they are mailed. 50$ pjs that have to be repaired before worn is not anything I will buy again. Disappointing"
1.0,"Cheap, and not worth the price."
1.0,"Although ordered large instead of  a medium to be on the safe side, it is super tight and very short, nothing like the picture and nothing islamic about it!"
1.0,Soft Plus sword that folds down in half wen u pick up! My kid was not happy with it at all
1.0,I wanted to love this dress so bad. The top fabric was pretty thin and sewn horribly to the bottom fabric. Not sure if I received a lemon or that this is just a poorly constructed dress. I was so excited about the pockets on the side but they just sort of proofed out and made the dress look awkward.
1.0,Upon receiving the shoes one shoe lit up brighter than the other.....by day three ( even after charging overnight) the shoe that didn’t light up as bright was completely dead. Will not purchase these again. If your child is looking for light ups it may be better to invest a little more money to have a higher quality shoe.
1.0,All i have to say is &#34; Plastic Plastic Plastic &#34;<br /><br />Very bad material. I will definitely going to return it.
1.0,"This cover-up is extremely cute, but the area near the straps was fraying by the end of the first day I wore it.  It will rip in no time.  Several places along the seams are not sewn together.  Very, very poor quality."
1.0,"Worked great for the first week, the material ripped after one week of use. Very unfortunate."
1.0,The thing was falling down the tie as soon as I put it on and it was broken by the end of the first day.  Do not buy this trash!
1.0,We ordered these 2 sizes larger and they were way too small.  Also had a huge hole in the pants.  Over all I feel like they are cheaply made and not great.  I'm not pleased.
1.0,"Small, breaks easy"
1.0,You could fit a fanny pack in the crotch. Who designed these.. Terrible. Don't buy.
1.0,"size is very slim, thin material, not well made.  Inches listed not accurate."
1.0,Please do not waste your money on this product! It is garbage! Not only is it not accurate to the picture but it feels terrible quality and looks awful. We returned ours.
1.0,Horrendous fit. Fine in terms of circumference but large bulging on the top. Very low quality material.
1.0,Had it only one day and it broke :(.  Sadly disappointed.
1.0,"Complete disappointment. I normally wear a 2-3X, this 3X didn't even come over my breasts. And the lining barely covered my private area, leaving the rest sheer. I had no idea about how sheer it was over most the dress and the dress fitting was a complete joke. Very very disappointed!!!"
1.0,The material wasn't what I thought it would be.  It's very compact
1.0,I thought these were cute and the metal on the nose felt like it wouldn’t come through the fabric. Only two washes in the mask pictured has a very sharp needle like piece of metal coming through the fabric. NOT what I want right by my child’s eyes! VERY disappointed
1.0,Did not fit well. Were uncomfortable.
1.0,I DONT KNOW IF THERE  IS A MISTAKE IN THE DESCRIPTION (HEADLINE) BECAUSE I CANNOT USE THE LENSES IN MY OAKLEY RADAR EV FRAME (IN THE HEADLINE SHOW ONLINE RADAR PATH)<br />I WILL NEED TO ASK FOR REFUND O CHANGE FOR THE CORRECT ONE.
1.0,"Socks were not knee high, these were crew.  Had to file a claim through AMAZON-- too much if a hassle"
1.0,Was disappointed with the broch. It's very cute online pic looks really classy cute but in person it looks drabby and matte finish not shiny and cute just is too dull for wat I needed it for. Was expecting a classy shine not a lifeless dull
1.0,I really think this product is fake...
1.0,Probably great for kids but I did not like
1.0,The socks were not warm and we returned them.
1.0,"I ordered navy, and this is a bleached-out denim color.  I am very unhappy!  Don't buy it."
1.0,"These boots are HUGE. I wear a 6.5. So the first pair I bought was a 7. They were ginormous, so I had to request some sort of return etc. Next I ordered the size 6- thinking OK, these have to fit. Finally received my boots size 6- and guess what. They are HUGE. I tried adding inserts and thick winter socks. No I’m still swimming in these boots. I don’t know what to do. Now I have two pairs of them and they are absolutely humongous and make you look like you have clown feet. Also, I it took about two months to receive each pair. That’s a long time!!"
1.0,The dress was not true to the sizes listed. We sent it back but the seller keeps asking me to keep it and only wants to give me partial credit so I can get it altered. They received the dress back and I still haven't received my refund. Don't buy from them the dresses are not good quality. It's shipped from China and they have a US return address.
1.0,Almost plastic
1.0,The day we got this the necklaces broke. We had to replace with other necklaces to use the medallion.
1.0,These pants would look good on someone with a tiny waist and a big booty. That is not me.<br />Fabric is super soft but very thin and flimsy. Had the waist not been so tiny I would have kept them for pajamas. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Gold coating rubs off, only had a few weeks and they're silver now. Won't turn your ear green but won't stay gold either."
1.0,"Broke a month later, light use, not fixable. finish wore off front"
1.0,"The packaging was well put together. However, I’ve had many of these backless bras. I hoped this seller would have had better quality by the care of the package and price etc. But it little tore the first time I even tighten the string. And as I even tried to wear it throughout the afternoon,  the sticky part started to come off. I was in the house while I wore it, it was also cold. So there was no reason for it to not stick. I’ve bought ones cheaper than this one that lasted way longer. Don’t waste your money! Disappointed."
1.0,"The size of the hoops is as the picture says (the description says something different). They are small, but that's what I was looking for. Unfortunately, to see the actual diamonds (like in the picture) you need a magnifying glass. I wouldn't mind if you could see some shine/sparkle but they're kinda dull. Actually, I think I could count 7 really tiny diamonds (only in the upper and front part cause they didn't put any in the lower part). And to top it off, they came with the plastic backs you can see in my picture (whick makes them feel cheap -not that they are expensive, but certainly not a couple of bucks either), not gold ones like they suggest in their last picture. Bottom line, I feel ripped off, definitely do not recommend."
1.0,Cute pjs but not the best quality
1.0,Returned. The collar was itchy. Otherwise for and color was good. Couldn’t get over the collar raising so high in the neck!
1.0,"Way, way to small!!"
1.0,"The ruffled part does not have as much volume and poof as the product image alludes to. It's kind of like when you buy a Halloween costume and you think the skirt is going to be nice and poofy, but you realize you need a petticoat to produce this effect. I was okay with that though, it was a pretty cute dress. I accounted for the reviews saying it ran small and got an XL, which ended up being too large for me but I figured it was alright since I could just cinch it with the belt. However, I wore this dress only a handful of times before the seam on the back starting to rip very visibly. The dress is really big on me so I'm not sure what caused the seams to tear, but I'm pretty upset that I wasted my money on this dress."
1.0,Super disappointed that the rose gold is already chipping off. I won't be buying this brand again.
1.0,DONT BUY! Seriously don’t it’s nothing like the pictures and wire in it attaches to nothing and it’s crap! For real don’t buy. Nothing nothing nothing nothing like picture! I wish I could give it a negative rating!
1.0,"i wear an xl , but knowing how the internet works i sized up , well this skirt is about a small maybe a medium ."
1.0,Worst sock ever. One or two wears and holes appeared. Excellent peice of garbage.
1.0,This “dress” is completely sheer and nothing like the photo. I waited a month just to be horrible unsatisfied. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"As the other reviewers stated, the sleeves! I ordered a medium because I like my sweaters large... It was too short, too tight, the aforementioned sleeves and the quality was terrible. I ordered two colors and am returning both"
1.0,"I purchased my first of two of these very attractive looking, reasonably priced watches on Amazon. The second watch was a REPLACEMENT for the FAILED  first watch.  A little over one month after the second watch arrived it also FAILED. In both watches the little gold colored, metallic frame originally located around the “day/date” simply came off and floated around the watch face —BOTH WATCHES! This kind of failing is unacceptable and my recommendation would HAVE to be to avoid this watch and this company. Since I was beyond the Amazon 30 day return window I will pay a $7.00+ “restocking fee” to return the item. I have no gripe with that— but with the SWANSON WATCH COMPANY from Japan? My advice is to STAY AWAY. The watch hands get caught on the floating metal framework piece so just ignoring the problem is not a solution. You’ve been warned."
1.0,The length is fine but they go up past my belly button? They are completely see through. Not thick at all the equivalent of panty hose. I know they were cheap but I'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED after waiting weeks for them just for them to be cheap crap. Never again
1.0,Wife said these are comfy but the very first time we washed them all the letters melted and stuck together. No special instructions for washing and drying on the label. Disappointed.
1.0,The description is not accurate.  They have no fleece lining.  Look and feel cheap.
1.0,"I ordered a large.  It fits short and snug, not long and loose like it shows on the model.  I returned it!"
1.0,No blue in earrings at all!!
1.0,Completely see through- you cannot wear this dress without another dress or slip under it.
1.0,Item description clearly states &#34;Quantity: 10 pieces&#34;. I received ONE. Not ten.<br /><br />The ONE I received seems to be a good quality. And it better be since I paid for TEN!
1.0,"It’s a beautiful watch, too bad it came scratched and the battery doesn’t work."
1.0,"I received it 5-20-20 and it quit working 5-27-2020<br />BEWARE, beautiful but weighs almost 1/2 pounds!!! Quit working in one week.  Have not heard from the seller. yet"
1.0,"For doubling the price from a year ago, you would think they could afford to use a little more thread on the pocket stitching.  Just like the 2 I got last year, less than a week and the pockets are coming apart.  Aside from that, they are nice sweatshirts given the limited selection in high vis clothing."
1.0,Very disappointed it is way too small
1.0,cheap crap
1.0,"Although I know your clothes run slightly smaller, I ordered an extra large. I'm a size 12, it looked and fit like a size small or a size 8. I gave it away, why? No return address or label . It was a beautiful dress!!!"
1.0,Made great but size is not accurate! Runs very small! Not a true 2 x more like regular medium if that. Very disappointed. I'm going to have to give it to a friend who is a fan! I will get another one at a later date!
1.0,Too small. I wanted XL.
1.0,"These dresses are NOT made the same! I ordered the long sleeve blue with the pattern on the bottom, and LOVED IT so much that I ordered the solid long sleeve green. I could barely fit this over my head it was SO TIGHT it honestly fit more like and XS than a Med!!! I am so sad, because it was supposed to be for Christmas too."
1.0,"These are hard, flat, and uncomfortable.  The 4LR in my work boots are WAY more comfortable.  I’m throwing these in the trash."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:6f0fc7274873914db0879b8ebed3cc49]] A braclet, and the necklace charms are missing"
1.0,"I haven't worn it once. took LITERALLY forever to show up, maybe more than half a year, made of super cheap material.  just don't get it"
1.0,"Very see through, to big, and the fabric is terrible!!!"
1.0,"Worst sweater I have ever bought, the reviews were right on it Worst of the Worst"
1.0,This was not easy on !!!  More difficult than other brands I have tried.  Will not buy again.
1.0,"I bought a 6-12 month size and after washing it, it probably fits a 3 month old. I attached a picture for comparison. Buy 2-3 sizes up from what your baby is wearing."
1.0,"Ran small, poor return options, slow shipping."
1.0,Just received and they have a post with no backing! So upset.
1.0,"Awful, not as pictured  at all. Polyester look like cheap silk pj's. Returning asap!"
1.0,"It may or may not have duck feathers, I wouldn't know for sure because the label was in Chinese. It is very thin and is not a winter coat at all. It might be more suitable as a windbreaker."
1.0,These are made poorly and not true to size.
1.0,To large and the pants were way to long
1.0,"If you like sandpaper, buy these pants. The material was made to help you shed your skin. But don't worry, it won't get your ankles, because the pants end at about mid-calf.... and I'm a 5 foot 4 woman with legs on the shorter side. Also, the only way I could breathe in these pants was to lift the waistline at the smallest part of my waist. They are so ridiculously tight that I might as well wear a corset. I didn't get the wrong size. I got my normal pant size and made sure to get the larger version as well. Sometimes, you gotta thank the stars for free returns."
1.0,TOO SMALL!!! Don’t waste your time or money on these if you plan on using it to cinch T-shirt’s. They may work on a toddlers clothes but definitely not adults.
1.0,"I received this and immediately returned it!! Not at all like the shirt pictured!! I went by the size chart and it was to short in the arms and tight in the stomach area. It was more of a shirt, and not like a sweatshirt. The coloring was not at all like the picture!!"
1.0,Doesnt stay attached to watch! Keeps coming off while I'm wearing it. Dont reccomend this product.  I've only had it for a week already have to replace it
1.0,"This simply isn't the same ring as the one pictured on the item page. While the advertised ring is shown with a clover-like design using inlaid polished blue and green stones and faceted clear stones, this one has only white/clear rhinestones and enamel. I've been trying to find the real ring for ages, but everybody seems to be selling a fake (there are at least two different fakes around)."
1.0,"Very lightweight and looks machine stamped, looks cheap like something you win at the carnival."
1.0,Piece of junk save your money<br />You have to give it a star just submit it would be more than one star
1.0,"It was horrible!  Looked as if a Kindergartner had cut the pattern out.  No sewing on seams, very thin poor quality material!"
1.0,Broke on the first day of wearing
1.0,Broke before I could even get it on.
1.0,Shoe looses all support after worn for hour.<br /><br />Unfortunately no support and thin sole.<br /><br />Ok for in home use only. Dont even think about taking out the trash.
1.0,Very very bad quality material.<br />Stay away.
1.0,not true to size too big
1.0,"The material of thisid hat is not at all what you expect it to be ! I gave it to my son for his birthday and it is Awful and because I ""Missed"" the return date I can't get my money back ! But Of Course We Know We Have To Buy It Early Because We NEVER Know How Long It's Going To Take To Get Here Because Of The Mail Situation ! Again Do Not Buy !!"
1.0,"The description is deceiving and needs to be changed. This is a waffle-textured, thermal-like shirt, not a sweater."
1.0,"Poor quality material. No stretch, very stiff & uncomfortable."
1.0,Run very large in both width and length
1.0,"Returned these slippers, did not fit well and very narrow."
1.0,"Where to start!? First; buckle lug pin broke when trying to put on wrist(I had spare pins) when you put the band on it loses its textue/color. Does not feel like real leather. Tad bit short. Could be about ⅜""-½"" longer. Liked the color until it faded out when putting it on, turned almost cream color. I really wanted to give this a good review. Just can't do it. This would be better suited for females that like this style and it would probably fit better on smaller wrists, male or female. Just dissapointed😠 not worth my money can't return because ""leather"" tore. I kept the buckle for spare parts and tossed the rest. If seller is willing to replace or refund I will consider upgrading review."
1.0,Cheaply made Chinese junk. Size on the hat says L/XL
1.0,El artículo vino con un detalle en la hebilla de ajuste lateral.
1.0,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! These took over TWO MONTHS to receive. Very cheap looking, poor quality . I can't even wear them , they are large and awkward looking."
1.0,it was ok for the money
1.0,"Not only did this not fit my Gear S2 properly,  it damaged the attachment hardware on the watch.  I had to take it back to ATT for them to do &#34;surgery&#34; to remove this watchband,  fix the attachment, and put my old watchband back on."
1.0,GIANT and the straps were VERY uneven.
1.0,I couldnt get the fold lines out of the hat no matter what I tried. I had to return it
1.0,It’s too big to keep the chapstick secure.
1.0,I ordered a size larger but still too small. Disappointed with sizes. Was very beautiful though
1.0,These shirts were small and had tags. Not the quality that you would expect from Hanes. Should have read the other reviews. Buyer beware.
1.0,It wasn't a arrow and I didn't get what I paid for.
1.0,These both failed. The spring weakens and fails to close completely and the keys end up falling out
1.0,SUPER CHEAP.turns fingers green after a day.
1.0,"This is junkie, it says fits most size.. only if you are a child and it is not returnable"
1.0,Not sure what “precious metals” they use in the necklace but neck and chest breaks out in a rash every time I wear it. Don’t purchase if you are sensitive to metals. Thought I would be safe by the description of what type of gold they use to manufacture this necklace. Not safe for sensitive skin.
1.0,"First, the shipment never arrived even after a couple of months, so I had to ask for a replacement. I did get it, but it arrived with absolutely no instructions. Since I didn't realize they're posted here, I had to figure it out by myself. It's not very user friendly! Also, I'm a normal sized woman, and this thing is HUGE on me. There's no way it will stay on my wrist and even though the strap looks adjustable in the pic, it's definitely not. So it was pretty much a waste of money for me."
1.0,"Too tight, not stretchy"
1.0,Poor quality items like these should be illegal to sell. I am going to ask for a refund. Atrocious.
1.0,Beautiful earrings but they were sent in a flat envelope and the post on one was not attached to the earring and the other post was bent flat to the side.  I returned those and the second pair was in an even flatter envelope - posts detached - in the process of returning.  Sorry because the light pink rose is really pretty.
1.0,Don't waste your money. These items are absolutely not stainless steel. I put one in my ear and almost immediately had a reaction to it because it's some cheap metal...
1.0,"I purchased three pairs of these a couple of months ago to wear with my Skecher's Go Walks.  I liked them so much I ordered five more pairs.  However, after waiting a month to receive the order what I got was a &#34;full&#34; footie.  It covers the entire top of my foot.  Very disappointed!  I suppose I will keep them to wear with regular gym shoes.  It would be way too much of a hassle to return."
1.0,large and uneven. Terrible quality
1.0,Cheaply made. Super light and not worth the money.
1.0,In theory it looks nice but when I got it fit me like a moo moo not flattering at all colors were pretty that was about it.
1.0,It looked and felt cheap and it says three sizes but you can only use the largest one the other two are very small
1.0,Very pretty but too long and I’m not good at hemming. It’s my own fault. I keep forgetting how short I am and how tall all models are!
1.0,It's not stainless steel it's already turned
1.0,These are way too big in size and the lens' are HUGE!  These are cheap and crappy sunglasses and I'm glad I only paid $4.00 for them!  Hideous!!!!!
1.0,Very large glasses not the I was wanting
1.0,"Clip on, yes, but not with the adjustable screw back shown in photo.  Nice, but can't use them, so 1 star."
1.0,This shirt is pretty until you put it on.  The shoulder seams are to low on the arms and the shirt looks like a box when you put it on.  I’m 5’9 and slim and it made me look huge.  Bad design.  I really wanted it to work.  It falls off your shoulders as well due to the weight.
1.0,Broke as soon as i opened it. Very disappointed
1.0,Beautiful but not flattering and smaller fit than expected.
1.0,"The downside of the is we large-breasted, sagging women won’t be able to enjoy cleavage or thin shtaps with certain clothes, because the top part of the adhesive will most definitely show."
1.0,One of the charms on the end was missing and the quality was poor. Looked like a young child made it and hand painted dots on it.
1.0,Way too be for my 10 year old
1.0,The t-shirt I ordered was described as a kid's large. They sent me a size 6 (which in typical girl sizes would be a small). On the size chart a large is supposed to be a 10-12.
1.0,I did not like the fact that it uses the word silver several times which is misleading!!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:4ed1db9be4910221ec8596076cda0fa]] Terrible, cheap belt, metal part is fake cheap plastic, it can't even hold my cosplay katana, straps are not adjustable, I don't even not how to connect it! Terrible for cosplay and katana training... Now I regret not reading the ratings please BEWARE before being this."
1.0,Returned.  Do not  Fabric and fit
1.0,The product was very low in quality. The zips ripped off very easily
1.0,2nd time purchasing this shapewear in a large.  The cut of the shapewear I received in my 2nd purchase was completely different to my first order. The leg openings are so small it cuts into my skin. Extremely disappointed and a waste of money. I will continue to use the first ones I bought and will not purchase from seller again.
1.0,I received the wrong bag twice
1.0,"unless you have a tiny tiny waist, don't buy this. Not for normal women"
1.0,Too flimsy and not firm enough.  It’s like putting on a rubber band.  It also runs small in size
1.0,This item is NOT the length pictured. I am a true Lady’s Large/size 12. The leg hem hits above my calves.
1.0,"Horrible quality , it’s almost as it was made up of paper"
1.0,it broke immediately.
1.0,It was darker than the picture and horrible material
1.0,"I was disappointed in the quality and returned it- never worn- and have yet to receive a credit.  It's been more than 2 months, maybe even 3 months... long time, no refund!"
1.0,"I was excited to receive this dress in the mail, and then I opened it. There is no way his garment is 100% cotton, not even 1% cotton.  From a distance it looks great, but it feels like a cheap polyester Halloween costume. It will be donated to the local thrift store."
1.0,This item is very bulky. It's not practical for storage and definitely not travel.
1.0,This dress had a super weird chemical smell and was also WAY smaller than expected. I do not recommend this.
1.0,Fit was awkward and flower placement made my chest look lopsided.returned
1.0,Love the look of the dress. The fabric is bad. Very bad! I’m so disappointed!<br />I will never order from out of the country... only if it is a designer I know!!!
1.0,WARNING DO NOT ORDER!!!!<br /><br />CAN NOT RETURN WITHOUT PAYING 59.00  TO RETURN.<br /><br />Cute shorts however..... RUNS VERY VERY SMALL.. 175 size 16 ... ordered XXL COULD NOT EVEN GET PASSED MY HIPS.
1.0,"Terrible fabric, no seams doesnt fit right would not ever buy if seen in person"
1.0,"Very poor construction. Doesn’t feel like any real leather I’ve ever seen,  and I have a horse so me and leather are good friends. Very flimsy, wouldn’t buy!!"
1.0,"These diapers are terrible.  Cumbersome,full of design flaws, and made in CHINA.  Complete waste of money.  Can find better covers cheaper elsewhere."
1.0,Every &#34;silver&#34; part on the bracelet has worn off and is now what appears copper colored where it used to be &#34;silver&#34;.....  Less than a month. GARBAGE!!!  So I would rate it a  0 but I can't.  Find another source that is not made of crap!!!
1.0,No lo recomiendo nunca lo use con la primera ves que lo agarre se daño
1.0,I got a large but suggest getting a medium or a small
1.0,More snugg fit.
1.0,Only stays silver for a week
1.0,"This item is extremely tight, so tight it can’t fit over my head so I can’t wear it at all. So angry it doesn’t stretch"
1.0,Way too small for the size that they say that they are.
1.0,The dress is very thin. It’s also tighter than what described. I’m also very disappointed because I had to wait close to two months before I even received this dress. I was going to wear this for my baby shower but I guess I’ll have go find something else.
1.0,Quality was poor and based on reviews was that it was cut small - was WAY too bign when received it.  Having difficulty retuning item.  Seller wants to bargin with me on the return so that I do not retun it.  SUPER DISSAPPOINTED
1.0,Looked weird.<br />Almost like the K was upside down.
1.0,"This has so many positive reviews, but . . . .  First time I wore this, while in a store, I was impressed with how comfortable is.  Then I looked closer.  The material directly in front of the mouth is reasonably thick, but top and bottom are too thin to make any difference... you can easily see through it.  No wonder it's so easy to breathe through!  I wish I could send it back, I'm going to have to go back to wearing double disposables (which I wash and reuse) and try a different singers mask. Very disappointed"
1.0,WAY too small/narrow.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this swimsuit, even after reading the not-so-great reviews. I'm usually a size small, so I ordered a medium like I do with most amazon swimsuits. The bottoms fit okay but there is no butt coverage whatsoever. The top was extremely small and couldn't stretch over my hips or my shoulders. The fabric was also surprisingly cheap, thin and flimsy (worse than anything else I've purchased on amazon for $10-$20). It's a shame because it's a really cute style, but it was executed horribly."
1.0,"I purchased two pairs of sterling silver and turquoise earring studs and the beautiful sterling silver and turquoise cuff bracelet. To my surprise when I took a trip to Arizona and purchased some jewelry from a Navajo jewelry maker, I was informed that the turquoise in my pieces were in fact plastic. It makes me sad to think that this company is taking advantage of people thinking that they are purchasing genuine turquoise from our beautiful native people. Need I say more."
1.0,don't waist your money  very cheep it had  no latch to put it on I trashed it.
1.0,"These masks were made for giants! Huge . . . Nearly cover my entire face. They have a hole where your nose is! So, you are breathing in any virus in the area. Plus, they do not stop glasses from fogging up! A total waste of money!"
1.0,I just did not fit in
1.0,Gold turned after one wear
1.0,"When I received this dress which is so cute in the photo, there was a random sewn seam across the chest area of the garment causing the dress to not fit properly.  It literally looks like the sewing machine went haywire.  Returned."
1.0,Fell apart after wearing them for a week. Not good quality at all
1.0,"Garbage.  I don't use an umbrella very often, but when I do, particularly one that is supposed to be windproof I expect it to not turn inside out and the handle to fall off.  I used this umbrella precisely twice.  The first time something inside broke and the self-collapsing feature wouldn't work.  ShedRain kindly replaced it.  The second time about 18 months later it was quite windy and when I stepped out of the parking garage, the thing turned inside out and the handle broke off.  It's sitting on my office floor and I want to send it back, but don't want another one."
1.0,Very thin. Horrible material
1.0,"I bought a grey, beige, and red sweater. They are nice but after wearing and washing the grey and beige sweaters I noticed pulls and fuzzies on them even though I washed them separately and in laundry bags. I wanted to return the red sweater but I was told at the postal service it would cost me $20 + just to send it back to California. It wasn't worth it. I would have maybe received a $15 refund for something I paid more than $30 for. Buyer beware."
1.0,I bought a pack of three and only got two shirts
1.0,I purchased this for my husband and the jacket fits luke its his little brothers coat. Bery poor quality. This is not a leather jackets.
1.0,I bought this dress and it was not what I expected at all maybe more because it swallowed me up. I’m a medium and purchased a large just in case. Awful.
1.0,Receive my bracelet today very pretty except kind of loose around my wrist
1.0,"I ordered two larges one from Beroy and this one, East-Bird. As a woman it's incredible annoying to order clothes. I don't trust East-Bird's sizes at all. The Large I got was a child's large. The large I got from Beroy fit just fine. I went through the charts and made sure- but this company just totally mis-labled their sizes and I get very offended with this because I hate having to ship things back- it's more about the environment than anything else. Which is why I gave one star. Carbon footprint is a HUGE thing for me and sadly I don't think companies truly understand we're in a crisis, or they don't care...for which deserves one star!<br />Design was fine, I think the tag even said made in USA, which is great! But unfortunately your large is a kids' large, or a small and you mislabeled."
1.0,Broke as soon as I tried to put it on. So sad.
1.0,Too small ordered xl  when i normally wear a large and its still to small .u need to order two sixes bigger than what u normally wear
1.0,It blocks the entire license plate. If you gave a New Jersey plate it covers the whole thing. I am asking for a refund.
1.0,"First off the shirt arrive in a flimsy cheap plastic box that was open and on the ground. Second, the material was some charge shiny 1970's throwback material for a disco not business or proper attire.  Third the collar on the shirt was too large like something from the 70's as well and not wide collar like it was suppoesed to be. Amazon never even know if the sellers are actually selling what they advertise.  Just about money. Ridiculous."
1.0,Do not pay this price. Not worth the money ! Extremely cheaply made.
1.0,this is very short
1.0,THEY WERE ALL SCRACTHED UP.
1.0,"The buckle mechanics are so bad that once the belt is fastened, it is very, very difficult to unbuckle -- very poor product."
1.0,Does even screw in properly
1.0,Very long posts and heavy weight to the front.  With the front design being so heavy it dangled down from the ear and was very uncomfortable.
1.0,"It's cute, mine came today with a rip in the front"
1.0,"Not like the hats we were able to buy on the ship, plastic material, stiff, unlikely to use."
1.0,"I was hesitant to order because in the past I have had issues with clothes coming from China.They run small, no matter how big you try and get them, they still seem to be small. I wear a size 14 US( and those are big) and it said that converted to a 4X. That's what I ordered. It barely zipped up, I am bummed because the shirt itself is super cute."
1.0,I have a very slim ankle but this was still too small. Am wearing it as a bracelet and it fits perfect. Cute but not what I bought it for.
1.0,"Don't buy this item!<br />As someone else mentioned, this bracelets color is just fake. it will leave stain marks on your wrist and your clothes. Don't buy it!!! Garbage alert!!"
1.0,They didn&#34;t fit on my glasses. poor design of mounting piece
1.0,Supermarket plastic bags are more durable than these. They are not long enough also so the knee left exposed
1.0,Am not happy this sweater is not as the picture shows not even close its thin when i ordered a sweater.
1.0,The pants are not fitted as I would like..... shirt fits well however I’m not a fan of the material
1.0,Top piece wouldn't stay attached. It was part of my Halloween costume but it was so annoying having to fix it all night I ended up ditching it. Waste of money.
1.0,Right shoe is smaller than left. Not able to get out and send back.
1.0,One of the earrings came bent where it forms the loop and it’s unwearable. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Very, very thin fabric. Poor construction. Missing hat"
1.0,"Website says ""durable and low irritation, safe and comfortable to wear for long time, not easy to rust"" but these necklaces rust within less than a days wear."
1.0,Two big uncomfortable to wear
1.0,"Worn a half-dozen times. Always machine washed cold water and tumble dry on low, and all of the elastic in the lace has started falling apart. Tiny stretchy strings everywhere."
1.0,I am so mad not even 1 day I was broke
1.0,Too much like tin
1.0,The crystals are pretty but the ring discolored to brass like metal in few weeks. I wish they can take it back because we bought two.<br />Please do not buy.
1.0,Color not as expected. The top is more of a nude under the lace. Returned
1.0,Looks good for a piece of trash. Stop working about 5 minutes I got it.  BUYER BEWARE DO NOT GET THIS WATCH OF BUY FROM THIS SELLER . WHAT A RIPE OFF  I used the watch band on another watch only good thing come from this.
1.0,"I ordered this fro my grandson, and he was thrilled.  Then, after wearing it for only several days, it broke where the braided band was attached to the magnetic clasp.  I have tried to repair it using regular glue and super glue.  It will not stay attached.  Needless to say, he was very disappointed as was I."
1.0,"I used the measurements and guidelines suggested by this supplier, too small. I cannot wear these."
1.0,These pants look cute in the picture but have a weird fit and are not well constructed.
1.0,"Very disappointed with these charms, look’s nothing like the picture. For the price I expected more from the company. Very CHEAP!!  Statue of Liberty charms"
1.0,"Very disappointed,it just had no life to it."
1.0,broke the first week of wear
1.0,"The other reviews were right- the chain is thick, giving it a cheap quality, plus the pendant is very thin/light. Didn't expect a whole lot for the price, but it really does look super tacky in person. Also the ""J"" looks more like a cursive lowercase ""g"" which really just bugs me. These necklaces would be cute for kids/teens, but not for an adult."
1.0,This coin purse was not what I expected. I gave it away to my friend
1.0,"I was excited about this bag. The color is perfect and it just seems nice and rugged. When it arrived I discovered it was barely large enough to hold my 13 inch MacBook (as long as it’s not in any type of a case) as well as a few cables and microfiber cloth. Could have returned it; however, it was my fault for not paying closer attention to the description.<br /><br />Unfortunately, within two months the stitching on the strap began to unravel (see photo). I could fix it myself but if it can’t survive two months of extremely light use without coming apart, I can’t trust it with my valuables."
1.0,I was very disappointed with this product.  I thought that I had finally found the oversized sunglasses that I have been looking for.  The size of the lens was much smaller than envisioned and the plastic frame was much too thick and heavy.  Don't know which Jackie they were named for but these are not the style or size that Jackie O. wore.
1.0,"These shades look very cool, and fit nicely on my big head, but very poorly made. The lens fell off, so it put it back on, but it is loose and keeps falling off. Today I wen to put them on and the left arm fell off. Now I have no shades for sunny days.."
1.0,Not for me..
1.0,"I wear a size 6 but ordered a 8/10 just in case, but even with that, the skirt was way too small. It definitely runs very small."
1.0,Doesn't look like picture! Can't return either!
1.0,"The whole box was deficient. As you can see from the pictures after ripping it off, there is only one layer of plastic. So i was not able to use it at all. Total waste of money."
1.0,Cheaply made and not true to size. Runs small.
1.0,The number 12 inside the watch just fell off in less than a month. Cost of fixing more than the watch.
1.0,Feels like cardboard. No give so it's very uncomfortable. It looks so soft in the picture:-(
1.0,"I ordered this jersey because I wanted the light blue color that was displayed. I am aware of colors on computers being various shades. The color I got was seafoam green, not the light blue I ordered."
1.0,One band is great.  The other comes unsnapped every time I turn my wrist so I can't use it
1.0,Ugly cheap quality .
1.0,When it got to me it was broken. Nothing I could even do to fix it. Came after Christmas and it was my little girls present. She was so disappointed. Thanks Amazon for another crappy product.
1.0,They don't light up all the time. One lights up but the other doesn't.
1.0,Way too small. Couldn't even get my leg through. Looked like child sizes.
1.0,Do not fit! They say they are plus size but they are tiiiiiny. Returning.
1.0,It needs something else connected to it to work maybe
1.0,Purchased this for my 11 yo daughter. Stopped working in the first week. My daughter was most disappointed as she saved up for the watch. It’s trash. Equally extraordinary is the supplier did not try to fix the situation. Don't count for any follow up support.
1.0,The sizes are extremely small and I donot think they are built for american men..
1.0,The coat is too large and fits weird. Plus there is no button to fasten it in the middle. Returning.
1.0,Broke the first day trying to adjust size
1.0,"Purchased for 2019 Ford Escape Ti,  It did not fit this key fob, it only comes up to the top of it. The holes in the case don't go past the top of key fob, so I can not push the screw through to attach the Keychain part. Also, mine had a blemish on the front of it."
1.0,"I bought this just to wear around the house since I work from home. I wanted something I comfy, that I wouldn’t be embarrassed taking my dog out in or seeing my neighbors in.<br /><br />It is not at all flattering and the cut (which I thought would look cute like in pics-makes ya look 20lbs heavier.<br /><br />It’s heavy, the material isn’t giving, the arms are snug. This does not feel like a comfy tee, which I expected.<br /><br />The heat press design is so uncomfortable, it’s like feeling a giant sticker on my chest.<br /><br />I wore this one time and never again."
1.0,was delivered CRUSHED and non functional. THANKS. Not spending another 120 to ship it back....
1.0,😟 😟 😟
1.0,It looks nothing like it’s supposed to! Really disappointed!
1.0,Don’t buy. Very disappointing. Material too thin. Just overall appearance ugly. Regret buying.
1.0,Runs way too small. Not worth paying the price to ship it back.
1.0,"Cheap 100% Polyester, no cotton at all!!!"
1.0,Basically like a burlap sack. Poor quality. Returning.
1.0,The threaded part of the keychain untied from the keychain clip after 2 days of having this keychain. Very disappointed with the quality.
1.0,First pair came in the mail today on time. Great! But when my son went to try them on one of the eyelet grommets fell off. We are returning them and reordering the same boot hoping that this was just a one-time glitch in manufacturing and not something that will happen again.
1.0,Very small and shred in the wash.
1.0,I really wanted to Love these. However the fabric is see-through and turns white where it stretches. If they don’t need to stretch to get over your butt or hips then you’re good to go but if you were like me and a curvy girl you will be disappointed. These are not squat proof. And I would not recommend wearing them out in the sun. They looked darker on my calves and lighter on my thighs and butt. I have pretty round hips and around but so it looked very noticeable. Unfortunately I am returning both pairs.
1.0,I don't think I'll be wearing this one.
1.0,"Really not happy at all. Ordered the L-XXL. The package said XL. The person they were supposed to be for is 5'6&#34; & about 160 lbs. They wouldn't come past the hips. Also, I ordered 2 packs of the set of 3 & got one. I also ordered the red which look like a dark, bright bubblegum pink. They didn't fit either. Have a slim 10 year old. They're too long, but should fit her in a year or 2 the way she's growing, so putting up. Not worth the return."
1.0,I got this in September and since I’m in Texas there really was no use to wear it. So I washed it and hung it up. Today the first cold front blows through and I went to get it out of the closet AND THE DAMN THING DOES NOT ZIP!!!
1.0,"awful piece of garbage. fell apart immediately.... did its job though, and does make the ring look much better."
1.0,Very disappointed in this item
1.0,"These are too small only made for youths or narrow shaped head people, way to tight on me. The darkest lens is not dark enough and they have a out of focus look through the lens, dont think its worth the money returned mine."
1.0,"Es una máscara sin forma y muy grande, no es para cabezas normales, por esto no cumple su función de asustar, al contrario, da risa!"
1.0,"Didn't like feel of fabric, Returned,"
1.0,"Writing unfavorable review, because mask was shipped folded right down the middle, which put a crease in the plastic that keeps mask from fitting Your face properly.  Therefore, your breathing fogs up the plastic, and the Plastic is not removable, so this was a complete waste of money! Stop folding your mask in half."
1.0,Product fit perfectly into frames... however on the 1st cleaning one of the lenses faded!!! Will add photo briefly! :( $24.00 dollars completely wasted....
1.0,It was nothing like the pic it was flimsy thin and I don’t believe it would of protected my son from the rain
1.0,Not true to size too small
1.0,"This product is not as described, it's actually terrible quality. Too big and loose. The material is cheap. It's faded and fuzzy on the first wash on a gentle cycle.... absolut garbage do not recommend. Don't waist your money or time on this"
1.0,Had a rip in the seam.  Was also large & frumpy looking on me.
1.0,OMG this shirt smelled so bad - I washed it maybe 3 or 4 times and finally threw it away.
1.0,This is the size  my three should  wear but the slipper fit my one year old this not by any means a XL 8 TO 10 ITS MORE LIKE A 6OR 7 I SURE WISH I COULD GET THESE THOMAS THE TRAIN SLIPPERS IN THE A TRUE SIZE TO FIT MY GRAND SON WHO WEARS A  9 1\2 I GUESS IF THIS IS XL EH WOULD NEED 3 TO 4 XXXX
1.0,Way to small it fits my two year old not my 8 year old.
1.0,"Buy something else. They’re basically plastic painted to look like stones. Idk what I expected but I was really disappointed. There are streak marks from the obvious paint they used and it’s so noticeable, I don’t want to even wear them."
1.0,"This product was a horrible, static-y, nightgown-like material. The colors were super off, it was really thin and see-through, and the seams were horribly sloppy. It was a very disappointing purchase. It wouldn't even have been worth half the price. The only thing I liked was that the seller did allow a free return, so I was able to do that and get my money back! I admire them for that, but I would not buy from them again."
1.0,We tried to use this to blow up my sons dinosaur costume and it did not have enough power to inflate it all the way and it took about 15 minutes foe it to kind of fill with air.  We changed the batteries but still same results.
1.0,Didn’t match the picture. They were too big.
1.0,"Yes, the socks are cute and the anti-skid will help with little feet but they are<br />1) way too big for infants.<br />2) look like they were sewn by a child (see pictures). The stitching is jagged around the foot hole. Instead of sewing the foot hole to the sock, they took a strip of cloth and crossed the it on top in a mismatched circle. The stitching is sloppily crossed on top of each other. The purple sock doesn't even have thread that is purple.<br /><br />Additionally, my yellow sock has a stain on it (circled in picture). I was going to give these as a gift but I am to embarrassed, as they look like they came from a dollar store. When you pay $12 for 5 pairs of socks you expect to get nice socks. Carters or Gerber socks can be purchased in 6 packs for less and are cute and made correctly. I don't know how all these reviews say they are so wonderful. I'm guessing they overlook the stitching, they are paid reviewers, or I got a defective set. Don't waste your money on these."
1.0,"It’s  Horrible. Looks like a badly made bathrobe. Tried to send it back. They offered $5 refund to keep it, then $8. Decided it was cheaper to take the $8 and keep it. Guess I’ll use it in a quilt!"
1.0,Cute but very cheap looking!
1.0,I bought seven T-shirts when I received only six items. When I received the carton I found it had torn sealing paper. I forgot to take pictures as evidence. Please check with the shipping company. I was disappointed
1.0,The bead colors weren't in the order as pictured. Returned items.
1.0,Not at all comfortable
1.0,Broke in less than a week...was loose on my wrist and the wing charm fell off....very sad.  Was a gift from my sons 😢
1.0,Actual design in the photo was not the same when received. It looked like someone printed a stretched out blurry picture on the dress. The material was stretchy but still snug and it was not the desired length. It came to the top of my knee caps and i am 5’6
1.0,Fail
1.0,"These slippers were fine when brand new, but after only two months the sole got detached (poor quality sewing).  Of course a shoemaker would charge more to repair than we paid for the slippers when new, so we are trashing them.  Very disappointed of course, and we will not buy this brand again."
1.0,Do not like. Way to big
1.0,"Too big,  sizing chart is wrong,  order a size down"
1.0,"Absolutely no help in reducing glare.  They turn everything yellow, but don't reduce glare at all.  Don't waste your time.  Returning them."
1.0,"This was nothing like the picture , very disappointed.  The W at the chest was smaller , the blue skirt was a totally different blue it was very light sky blue."
1.0,It is big. Very disappointed in the return process with them. They where unhelpful and not efficient. Nothing but a headache!!!!
1.0,The material of the strap feels cheep and is easy to tear. The clips are also very poor quality and broke the first time I tried to open it.
1.0,This screen protector is garbage. It would peel off when I tried to install a thin Spigen case. So I used the phone without a case for a few days but then the screen protector cracked. No idea how it cracked but it should last more than a week.
1.0,"Received a dirty, definitely worn pair of yoga pant. Disgusting."
1.0,"While the product seemed good enough, it was not true to size and thus did not fit which was a bit disappointing."
1.0,"Shirts arrived on time, they are not true to size.  Very disappointed"
1.0,This top is not as pictured. It looks like a square with a strange band at the bottom. The pockets are in the side seam not on the front. Don’t buy your clothes from Amazon. Lesson learned.
1.0,Low to poor quality. Threw it away. Save your money.
1.0,They will grab and pinch your skin.  Bad buy.
1.0,"Really cheap quality.. the picture makes it look flowy, but I ordered an extra large (I normally wear large) and it was tight.. probably won’t be wearing it.. looks like I bought it from a cheap street vendor in NYC.."
1.0,One side of the band will connect to the Apple watch and one side will not go into the slot of the watch at all.  Very disappointed with the product.
1.0,Ordered. For daughter a 4x measurements. On description of size are completely off! It took weeks to get here.. It better fits 12 yr old granddaughter and she's a small. Total disappointment.
1.0,Not 100% cotton<br />Not even close to what was expected
1.0,I just open my bag to used for tomorrow and I notice it’s broken.
1.0,Love the earrings I saw on Amazon.  Ordered them for a gift.  I never paid attention of the fact that they're not the same length!!!!!!!  I would like a replacement.  I was so embarrassed for the recipient of this gift!!!!!!!
1.0,Runs too big.
1.0,"The height listed of 20mm is absolutely incorrect. They are about three times that, around 60mm or 2 inches. Now I get to pay for the postage to send them back despite the fact that the description is incorrect."
1.0,Don’t like it! 👎🏾<br />Itches a lot 😞
1.0,"Totally disappointed I received the package, but it was missing the closing cap"
1.0,WOW!!!  This handbag is nothing like the website presented.  It is big and quite ugly.  I will be returning this item.
1.0,Sizing too small even for the largest
1.0,"Runs SOOOO small!! I got an XL and it was the size of a medium. Ridiculous, I had to give it to a friend who was teensy."
1.0,My first negative review ever! Worst slippers! My 6 year old daughter wore these once to summer camp. She loves rainbows so she tolerated the awkward fit. Velcro completely came off the first day. Very sad and a big waste of money
1.0,Runs a few sizes too small.
1.0,"This is NOT sterling silver. My skin is very reactive to plated metal. Within 24 hours, my finger was itchy, red and swollen. If you don’t have issues with plated metal, go for it! The ring itself is very cute. It just irritated my skin and I can’t wear it."
1.0,Broke almost immediately. I am able to get a refund. It was cheap so I should have expected.
1.0,"I purchased this dress and when I put it on and went outside you could see that it had some kind of marker written all over it, it's hard to see indoors but outside with the sun you can see the marker all over the front of the dress. I thought it might have just been fabric marker that would wash out so I tried washing it and it didn't come out. I can't wear the dress. You can see the marker writing on it. I'm pretty disappointed because it was a nice dress, I just can't wear it because of the marker stains."
1.0,Purchased three. This being one of them the other two fit perfectly but this one was way too small. Product seems not to be consistent in terms of quality. Double checked the size tags and was the same.
1.0,"This is too ""silky"" for me - probably won't wear it much, if at all...."
1.0,"I purchased three of these pendant necklaces because they were advertised as stainless steel. After giving two of them to close friends, I was mortified to find my pendant was discolored! It is definitely not the solid stainless steel it be was advertised to be. I won't bother returning the one pendant in my possession. I guess truth in advertising is an outdated idea."
1.0,beyond cheap material
1.0,Luckily the bottoms broke before I left the house. It was a gorgeous swim suit and I was in love with the color and the gems. I wanted to take pictures and sat down and felt my whole bum come out! I couldn't figure out any good way to fix it.
1.0,Broke the first day I received it
1.0,I've only had this pair for about month and wore them maybe 5 times.They have turned an unhealthy shade of grayish black.  I am so sad because I really loved everything else about them.
1.0,Thumbs down!!!
1.0,its not even close to that nice (from the picture).
1.0,Tire after 2 weeks
1.0,"NOPE!! This does not look like it is worth the price! It looks like it will fit the arm of a small baby, not going to keep this because it is not something made for a child."
1.0,5 months in and the coating on one of the lenses have worn off.  There are black blotches on the lenses rendering them useless. I have used nothing but microfiber clothes and lens cleaning solution that is safe on polarized lenses .
1.0,"I didn't know there were such a thing until I bought these. At first they fit me perfectly, and then after a few weeks I noticed that they were kinda loose in the legs area (where you fit your legs, if you will). Since then it's gotten from bad to worse to the point I am probably just going to toss them in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I NEEDED THIS DRESS FOR AN EVENT AND I RECEIVED IT WITH ZIPPER BROKEN!!! PLUS THE DRESS IS NOT TRUE TO SIZE AND VERY CHEAPLY  MADE! NOW I HAVE TO WASTE MORE MONEY TO EITHER BUY A NEW GOWN OR GET THE ZIPPER FIXED!!! I WILL BE RETURNING  IT!! PLEASE BE AWARE!
1.0,So order a size smaller
1.0,"My granddaughter loved them but after less than 2 months the sole fell completely off. Seemed like a good deal but $30 for 7 weeks of wear, not great."
1.0,This was not the same as I can buy directly in the store for the same brand and size.  Super thin and quality just not there.  I didn't think it would last long at all.  I returned and went back to the store.
1.0,"Too small, too tight. They came up every time we searched for men’s Nike socks. Not like Nike at all! They are being returned."
1.0,Didn't work for my bad night vision.
1.0,Plastic end bent and broke easily.
1.0,"The thing is mis sized, do not buy"
1.0,It was much too large and the chain seemed too small to support it.  I shall return.
1.0,Broke the first day it was worn.
1.0,Stop bothering me
1.0,"I got this pack solely for the black mask (It's what I have to wear at work). I liked the look of the construction and decided it was worth it if it was a really good one.  To my disappointment that's the one that's messed up. It is sewn wrong, and completely unwearable."
1.0,Odd top. The print with the little green hearts is soooo cute but it’s so wide and short you can’t wear it without looking silly. I had to return
1.0,This product wasn't worth what I paid for it. Don't waste your money buying it.
1.0,This item did not meet my expectations. When I put it on it was so short in the back that made cheeks hung out. My husband said it was not flattering.
1.0,The elastic split the first time I wore it
1.0,"Wanted a dress with pockets, and this shows pockets but there are none."
1.0,Gold color was flaked off all over.... you get what you pay for.
1.0,"I had my eye on this dress for months and was waiting until after I had my baby. Disappointing all around. The fabric appears worn and the stripes are not clean looking, more blurred and cheaply printed. THIS RUNS VERY SMALL! I ordered a large to have it fit loosely on my size 4-6 body (5'5, 135) and it's more like a t-shirt!"
1.0,THE SECOND WORSE GIFT I HAVE BOUGHT WAS THESE EARINGS.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY FOR A ADULT IF YOU MUST HAVE THEM BUY THEM FOR A CHILD. ONLY!!!
1.0,cheaply made and fit awful
1.0,"Not shade shown, smaller than most other sunglasses of same sort"
1.0,I could not find a half slip without driving all over town. Nobody wears slips anymore.<br />I cut it to fit.<br />Happy not expensive.
1.0,Broke the second I put it online
1.0,"Horrible material, the smell was so bad and strong. Very small. Have to put it in the garbage."
1.0,It could have fir a giant.
1.0,Low quality and not a good fit for anyone.
1.0,Looks and fits nothing like the picture. The model must be 4 foot.
1.0,Would not buy again. Keeps stretching out. Also the material is too warm for over 90 degrees.
1.0,"It is difficult to give this umbrella a fair review....we were not able to assemble it because it was shipped without hardware! Very disappointing....however, the umbrella looks beautiful in the box."
1.0,It came inside out and couldn't be worn properly. It's a waste of money and I don't recommend purchasing it.
1.0,Perfect! Exactly as advertised! Loved this item for our soon to be 3 year old granddaughter in Maui♥️‼️
1.0,Broke before could wear them
1.0,Poorly made. Bad seamstress. My leg didnt even fit into the pant. Wow!! I know I didnt gain that much weight. People beware. These pants run very small. I got a large bcz Im 5”8 and big boned and the butt and waist looked fine but these pants were cut like skinny jeans but whoever sewed it must have been drunk when they made these pants bcz my foot woulnt fit into the leg of the pant.
1.0,"Opened the package eagerly and found a truly lovely watch pendant.  Unfortunately, when I picked it up the watch, the loop at the top of the watch where the chain feeds through broke."
1.0,Very very small and they are kinda sharp inside of your nose. I have had better items before these.
1.0,Poor quality - two buttons popped off on first wear and hems were frayed. Would not recommend.
1.0,So it looks like it does in the picture the colors are vibrant but the shirt was to small like skin tight and the shorts were way to big they just fell right off my kiddo
1.0,It is way to small. That was not a 2x. I will noy buy clothing
1.0,Cheaply made already fraying and I have not washed it or got it wet....
1.0,My daughter lost the back that is supposed to be a screw on back within 2 days of wearing.  They only thread on like 2 times.  Not worth it.
1.0,Picture looks like casual office wear.  Looks more like comfy pjs.  Could possibly be worn as pictured if you were shorter in stature.
1.0,This dress while it looks great on the hanger it  has the feel and texture of a raincoat.  Very stiff and noisy.  Would not recommend it.  My husband laughed when I put it on.  Great fit but would not wear it anywhere.  Bummer.  So cute.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:19a53c128f618834278e326db90593b0]] Not really happy it's a put it together yourself. Found that kind of weird and the bar is backwards
1.0,Terrible umbrella! It lasted ten seconds in the wind. Cheaply made.  I'd give less stars if I could!
1.0,"The Ocean Sunglasses are not worth for that price, to expensive, the have murky green shine when you look through glass a bad reflection.<br />I have the feeling they are fake or not good quality.<br /><br />And this is not true (The anti-splash hydrophobic coating repels salt residue, fingerprints and oils and provides superior scratch resistance for long lasting on the water performance.) It does not repel.<br /><br />There are not good at all, very disappointed"
1.0,All but three of the nose rings were destroyed during delivery. Will be getting refund immediately. So sad because the actual designs were so cute.
1.0,May return them not sturdy ebough
1.0,I received it broken. Even went to a watch shop to tell me
1.0,Horrible. The heart is a lot smaller than pictured and the chain broke after wearing it once. Dont waste your money
1.0,Kind of expected. I bought 2 pairs and one set had one earring that wouldn't fasten securely to the back. It was very loose. I can't wear it or it will fall off.
1.0,Very cheap looking material. I was very unhappy with product..The purse looks different in person
1.0,"the product doesnt even have a box, its more like being bought in the street and resll it online. the item doesnt deserved the price!"
1.0,The dress itself runs larger than expected size. The pockets make the butt look super big (in a negative way) and the dress is actually longer than expected. Basically I look short and fat with this dress on. NOT recommended it at all unless that’s the look you’re going for.
1.0,I normally wear a small in tops but ordered this in a medium. This top barely came over my chest. Not a good top at all!
1.0,This is some smelly rubber platex thing. It is not hard plastic. Waste of money. Was a birthday present for my son. Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered 2-3x got size lg plus spot on front<br />Love the blouse would like replacement in plus size xx or xxx
1.0,Complete and utter crap. The loops broke and most charms weee discolored
1.0,Cheap!!!!
1.0,I'm American made. These shirts are so small they probably would fit my 7 year old granddaughter.<br />Sorry but wow!!!!
1.0,Runs very very small :(<br />Not plus size at all
1.0,"The product arrived broken due to inappropriate packaging, and two pieces of the same side (not paired) were received. The product itsekf is sort of cute, but one of those cheap earrings you find elsewhere."
1.0,"Way to small, this mask is suited for a 1year old!!"
1.0,Ordered a size 13 for my man and they didnt fit.
1.0,"Although the dress looks looks cute, it is made up of really cheap quality. I wore in once and got torn from the right side. This happened when I was traveling. It was really embarrassing! Please do not buy it!"
1.0,"They were advertised as having underwire, but that's not true. In place of the underwire there's a material to make it appear that there is underwire, but it's just empty material.  If you are looking for support, don't bother with this."
1.0,"This product is not accurate. That is not the sign for ""b"" in ASL"
1.0,Even though it was my size they were too small
1.0,Very cheap. Do not buy.
1.0,bought in April.  already broke and its only August.  cheap. should replace it
1.0,"Awful looks like it should go on two yr old, regret buying"
1.0,It’s super cute however it had a hole in it when I took it out of the package.
1.0,These masks stink! Why would I want to cover my nose and mouth with something that stinks?! Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Don't buy this, my head is an xl and it is several sizes too big for me, everything about it is wrong. The eye holes seem to have been cut by some drunk 4 yr oldsand the jaw is clumsily attached by some very shiny rivets in addition to being approx 3-4"" forward of my face. Terrible don't waste your money"
1.0,"It was the wrong picture on the front, the size was either not labeled right or I ordered the wrong size. I believe it was sized wrong. This is the second one that was the wrong size and I will be returning."
1.0,product broke after a eeek poor construction of rubber holder. I never recieved my bonus packade either
1.0,It did not fit in my nose so I had to send it back
1.0,Material is so cheap and looks nothing like it does in the photo. Was returned immediately
1.0,very poorly sewn
1.0,I used this as a replacement for my GShock watch. The pins were way smaller than the original pins. And one pin fell apart as I was installing it into the watch.
1.0,I only got them two days ago and the little stone has already fallen out of the hoop.
1.0,"Worst seller, awful product, and “Free Returns” means nothing on Amazon. Make sure you are aware when buying from this seller. The bras fit exactly like the picture and it isn’t a good fit for a bra. Entire experience was dreadful."
1.0,It's diferente
1.0,"Way to tight,not at all what I expected"
1.0,Had to return it. Too small at size 11 doe my 9 foot.
1.0,"This is nothing but an unfinished piece of tubular fabric.  I'm afraid to try it out, since there is nothing to keep the edges from raveling.  And the seller is in China, so it looks like I can't return it."
1.0,"First, YOU ONLY GET ONE. Second, It’s cute from the front, thick is ever from the side, and looks cheap from the back. Literally it’s so thick it looks like it’s supposed to plug your belly button up, and it does. Image makes it look so much more petite. The picture is misleading. There’s more sunflower than ring. Waste of money. Going in the trash."
1.0,This is a horrible knock off of the picture the seller is using. Not even the same fabric.
1.0,Made cheep
1.0,Dont waste your money! I've had these slippers for not even two months and the thread is already coming undone!
1.0,I cannot give a true review of this dress because I received a completely different dress that looked nothing like the Fire Kirin Women's Ruffles V-Neck Ruched Cocktail Club Evening Party Falbala Bodycon Dress.
1.0,I returned this it’s terrible quality material.
1.0,This doesn't fit my apple watch.  And it's not well made.  Don't bother.  Made in china.
1.0,"It's measurements were too big for my Samsung Galaxy S9 watch. I liked the band but the size was off, so no good for me. I was disappointed."
1.0,"STOP----LOOK-------LISTEN---Folks, this is, by far,  the biggest scam going on T,V.---Don't fall victim to these thieves. Once you give your credit card number---you will be flim flammed---Krappy product--krappy cust.service--If you want to throw your money away,go to dollar tree ,buy a couple pair of glass's, smear a little vaseline on the lens---presto--you have a pair of zoomies---and you will not be near as disappointed as ordering from this site---and you have enough money left over to get a meal at mickie d's.."
1.0,"Tight, shows my cleavage, looks awful. I can't even wear it. Wasted my money."
1.0,Wire came disconnected from the mask within 1 day.
1.0,Was damaged when received.<br />I returned it.
1.0,"It does not have two bunny faces.... it has one bumny face and the word bunny. These are not wearable, do not buy."
1.0,although the pack came with three I am now on my third satin cap because they keep ripping at the seams. Please don’t buy
1.0,The material was scratchy and the dress was very cheaply made. The elastic at the top looked so cheap does not look anything like the picture
1.0,Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. This is not a hoodie like it says in the description. It’s basically a long sleeve shirt with a hood. It’s not even thick like a hoodie or sweatshirt should be or is. Also the design on the arms is peeling off. Will be returning and purchasing elsewhere.
1.0,"Disliked. Even though there were 3 in the set, the chain was ugly, cheap and the supposedly rocks were real?!  To polished and I didn't like them"
1.0,The sleeves were very large kinda like MC hammer pants were :)
1.0,Had to return instantly and get name brand
1.0,The didn’t fit well. They were loose and slipped off when I took a step. I’m also not convinced that they’re women’s shoes.
1.0,Arrived in a plastic ziplock. All 3 were clearly used and smelled like a sweaty ...<br /><br />Do not trust.
1.0,Never even wore these once after trying them on. Threw them in my truck as an emergency back up pair.
1.0,Very flimsy!
1.0,"Upon being wound, sometimes it ticks for a few seconds & then stops & sometimes it won't even start ticking at all. So obviously it can't keep time.<br />It does look nice & could work well as a costume piece. (I've seen this watch in other colors being sold for around $5. It might almost be worth that if sold as a prop instead of a timepiece.)<br />More details that may matter to you: the clear parts are plastic, not glass; the Roman Numeral for 4 is incorrect; it's hard to make out the blue numbers unless light is shining directly on them; & I personally would have preferred if it was bigger."
1.0,Scallops look like they were hand cut.  Runs small.
1.0,This product looks and feel cheap. Also was delivered without receive and not name. Sorry but poor delivery and poor quality.
1.0,Body was good size- arms way to tight!
1.0,I requested a new one because the first one sent looked worn. I received a new one but a size bigger then the original. When I went to return it the window closed and now stuck with a dress that is way too large for me! Very disappointed.
1.0,😝
1.0,One day of trying on a purple colored nose piercing and the color came off and ended up being silver.
1.0,"I really hated this sweater.<br /><br />It’s thin and flimsy, not chunky at all. It arrived in a vacuum sealed bag, and it was super wrinkled and not attractive at all. I hung it up hoping the wrinkles would fall out but that didn’t happen. So I washed it hoping that would soften the sweater and make it look more relaxed like in the picture. Didn’t work.<br /><br />I would not recommend this sweater to anyone. The photo and description are misleading."
1.0,The inside of the shirt was dirty! This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable!
1.0,One of the sleaves was sideways
1.0,One shoulder droops and the other is higher. It is sewn in a fashion that is cheap and the shape is odd.<br />I will not buy this again.
1.0,Not at all like the picture.
1.0,It was way smaller then what they said
1.0,The zipper is hard to work as you need to use both hands to open and close it. The clips on the straps keep needing adjustment.
1.0,My son wore these for two days and they broke. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,SOOO SMALL!!! I normally wear a medium in dress shirts etc but I love big t-shirts so I ordered an x-large! An x-large is like a SMALL!! The shirt is also super itchy.
1.0,"Quality appears to be irritating, the masks are sized incorrectly, fitted to be small..., not the normal quality for the company..., disappointed..., wasted my limited money"
1.0,It's a 34 inch band with an extender... stay away
1.0,"Poor quality wig, poor quality costume, Especially for the price. The wig was horrifically made, I’ve gotten wigs from the dollar store that have been better. And the dress itself absolutely did not fit and I even bought a size larger than what it was recommended."
1.0,Ordered up a size...3xl fit my daughter who wears a size medium. It costs more than it’s worth to return it. Do not recommend.
1.0,"very loose on the back, seems like there's too much fabric and bunches in the back, unlike the model.<br />Also the dress is made of a very thin material, it is completely see through, even with a nude bra underneath, would NOT recommend buying this dress, spend a little more for better quality somewhere else<br /><br />I wish it was made of a better material cause the style is really cute."
1.0,"Stones fell off in less than a week, now the seller won't refund because I can't give them the stones."
1.0,"Horrible cheap glasses. The frame and lenses are thin plastic,"
1.0,I would rate this a zero if I could. Keychains arrived damaged. Bought these for birthday party favors. Pieces are so cheap they are falling apart. Probably won’t even hold keys on them. Do not buy these.
1.0,This boot had obviously been worn.  It was advertised as new and had signs of wear on the bottom and the toe of the boot.  I was very disappointed.
1.0,Description not clear. I purchased the necklace in hope of it being customized. Only to find out it actually comes as &#34;Laura&#34;
1.0,"The zipper was not fully functional and at first touch the wallet felt really cheap. For $60 you'd expect much more. I sent it back,"
1.0,"This item has a deceiving “waterproof” title, we used it on a mild rainy day on one of our trips. My jacket under got completely soaked. We have a different brand for my husband and daughter and that one kept their clothing underneath dry. This product is not intended to keep you dry! Look elsewhere. Horrible product. If I could give it 0 stars I would, irritated to give them 1 when they deserve 0."
1.0,Horrible fit . I’ve ordered many dresses off amazon and this is the only one that’s had to be returned.
1.0,"Seemed solid enough at first, but the hinge gave out after not even three months of use. I did use it a lot, opening and closing dozens of times a day. But still, I bought it in June and it didn't last through September.<br /><br />Update: My original review was in September. I had actually bought two of these things back in June and started using the second after the first one's hinge gave out. Now it's December and the hinge on the second one has gone too. I realize that two for two is still a small sample size, but other reviewers seem to have noticed the same thing. These last for almost three months and not a week more."
1.0,"Cheap looking, poor quality. Returned it."
1.0,"The legs are too loose, and too short. The waist is too tight. I ordered  the long leg, and they are still to short."
1.0,Horrible material only had it 2 weeks and can’t wear it anymore after one wash it is worn
1.0,Skirt shrank after washing and went from black to rose
1.0,"Maybe it's because I was hoping this would fit when I sat down. Or when I stood up. Nevertheless, this is made out of the most unforgiving fabric that will not stretch or bend with any natural movement at all whatsoever. Sure looks cool, but only if you're a mannequin. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it's horrible."
1.0,"La Linea de los hombres me quedó mal, un lado quedaba más alto que otro.Estaba mal cosido.<br />La tela es como licra y delgada. Nada favorecedor."
1.0,The wire that inserts into the ear was misshapen and very loose. They were returned.
1.0,The hoops clasp do not close. The reason why I bought this pack. Can't even wear them.
1.0,"My 14 year old daughter could not see very well while wearing it.  Very awkward fit.  It sits to far away from the face.  I even had had her to wear it before the game to get adjusted to having it on. After wearing it for a few minutes during the game, she had to take it off.  It really was a waste of money."
1.0,Watch broke 48 hours from beginning of wearing. Unable to repair.
1.0,"First one I ordered the skirt zipper came broken I wasn't able to zip it down. The second skirt that was the replacement, the second time I wore it the zipper came undone. I tried to zip down since that can solve that problem and the top snapped. Ruined. Really disappointed and don't want to go through reordering if you're product keeps breaking the same way. I purposely ordered over sized since I wanted to tuck sweaters so this is definitely not a too small or tight problem."
1.0,"I bought this for my 18 month daughter but it was  way too big ,and the fabric texture was terrible I regret buying it"
1.0,"Was very disappointed, would not fit anyone larger than a petite person properly. That is it could not be wrapped and draped as shown in the pictures. Also the smell was very chemical and after several hours of airing it lingered. I had it on for about 5 minutes and it made me red and itchy..... I returned it for a refund"
1.0,"I sent it back it was nothing like pictured!! It had no wrap closure. Too small and I have an ""A"" cup"
1.0,"I’m size 5 or 5.5, I ordered size 5 expecting it would fit me nicely. However the band was in the weird place, the shoes r too large. It was a nice concept and cheap but it’s not even worth it even if it sell for 5$"
1.0,"Way too small, maybe good for little kids. Made in China what do you expect!"
1.0,The shark that is right in the center of the shirt and the biggest (Whale Shark) was misspelled! They spelled it: Whale Sharl.  “L” instead of “K”. It may not have been so obvious on any of the smaller sharks but right in the center - the largest shark - your eyes are drawn to that shark and to the misspelled word. Disappointing.
1.0,"The looks of this dress are deceiving!!  It is made of extremely thin, cheap polyester material.  I'm glad I didn't buy a 2 pack.  I'm sending it back today..."
1.0,"For your waist line. Don't stretch, too little, it's hard"
1.0,"Sure, the item was pretty and all, but the customer service was top of the line TERRIBLE!!! Just to be clear, I ordered directly from the Lipault website. I returned the item for a refund since it was not what I needed or thought it would be and the customer service rep gave me the WRONG ADDRESS for the return. If their online return was working, the outcome might have been different, BUT it didn't. So, I was ended up calling their customer service number to get the address where I was to send the item. And guess what? THEY GAVE ME THE WRONG ADDRESS!!! I tracked down the return and it was delivered to the (WRONG) address they initially gave me. I wondered why I haven't received any email from them confirming item receipt and refund processing, so I called their customer service number AGAIN, and another rep told me that the address given to me was wrong!!! I emailed them several times and THEY NEVER RESPONDED. I NEVER GOT MY REFUND of over $100.00. Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. NEVER AGAIN will I purchase from Lipault!!!"
1.0,Dress was not red but was an odd orange. Material was cheap and wasn't put together good. Stain on front. I wanted to love this dress but sadly had to return.
1.0,Fits great but what a big disappointment after one wash the stitching and material completely unraveling  I don't know what this is definitely not a Russell sweatshirt getting this directly from Amazon I'm makes it more disappointing I may as  well took my money and literally flush it down the toilet what a waste will not buy again 👎🏽👎🏽
1.0,"Bought a size 2 little kid, for my 7 year old son. The elastic laces snapped off after only 3 days of wear. Very disappointed. Will be returning."
1.0,It just felt cheap.
1.0,The picture shows a beautiful ball of crystals but what you actually get is a ball with missy crystals and the ball showing between the gaps.
1.0,Don’t buy this
1.0,"It's WAY too big!<br />I ordered  larger due to the reviews!<br />Now what,  I can't use it. I should have got  a medium."
1.0,"Purchased for grandchild. Got the largest size, but too small. Please carry in a larger size!!!!"
1.0,It only made the lights yellow. No difference in “night vision!”
1.0,"This dress is nothing like the beautiful dress in the listing.  The dress had unfinished edges, sewing errors, and a cheap appliqué that was simply tacked down in a few places. The lavender flowers look almost gray on the actual dress. It isn’t pretty at all. Don’t be misled by the image in the listing. I have to return this because I would never put this on a baby."
1.0,The gems started falling off as SOON as I took the necklace out of the packaging.
1.0,"Runs extremely small!!! i where L-XL in all dresses and i ordered a LX and it didn't even close, i think maybe it was lemon."
1.0,This is the first item I've got from amazon that sucked. Nothing like pictures. Couldn't even tell if it was Hello Kitty
1.0,The lace in the back does not match the picture. It is baggy in some places and tight in others. It does not look like the picture. This is a purchase I regret.
1.0,Supper loose
1.0,"Pretty, but wouldn't recommend. Very poorly made. The part that the post is held by is very flimsy and won't hold the post in even when you try to squeeze it to make it tighter. VERY DISAPPOINTED. RETURNED!"
1.0,It's very pretty but had no support so I have to return it. Boo.
1.0,"NOT 100% cotton as indicated, asked, and answered. 100% polyester hat: icky to touch, irritant to allergy. Insignia is printed. By choosing the cheap hat, I will now either be wearing a much more expensive hat or no hat at all. The hat did arrive well packed, in perfect condition, and when promised."
1.0,this shirt barely covered my breast and i ordered a large
1.0,Heel always slip down. Don't work at all.
1.0,"Way, way overpriced"
1.0,"Not good quality, chain broke received defective"
1.0,I didn’t even my child try them on. They obviously came used. There’s dirt (see pictures) on the bottoms and black hair in the Velcro. I sent them back right away and won’t be purchasing from this company. Yuck.
1.0,"They are very cute but when they arrived, the part that goes in your ear was completely bent. When I tried straightening it, the color chipped off. They just shipped it in a small plastic bag and when I got the package, the earrings were poking out."
1.0,it says 100% silk but I dont think it is
1.0,I ordered two shirts from this company they were a size xl dryed them and now they’re a toddler size medium. Not happy with my order at all !!
1.0,I liked the 3 stone look even though getting the jewelry in was tricky.  Highly disappointed as it turned my ear green in just over 2 weeks.
1.0,"the material this company uses ,os very cheap,.it ripped and tore on just one use,..bad company to deal with"
1.0,Do not waste your money mine arrived today opened the box and was very dissatisfied. The helmet was severely misshapen and the inside is held together by electric tape.
1.0,Broke in less than a day
1.0,"The chest area is VERY SMALL. Everything else about this dress is great, but unfortunately it is not made for busty women."
1.0,"It is made of slinky satiny material. Definitely not anything like a sweatshirt. Ugly, bad fitting."
1.0,"These socks are much heavier than expected and unfortunately the fabric has little stretch.  It makes it very hard to get them on your feet, much less up your leg.  After all the effort of pulling them on, they fit alright, but would only wear them in the winter.  Sending them back as the effort of getting them on is not worth it.  Not a good fit!"
1.0,I can’t stand the new ‘wwe’ logo. It looks disgusting. I wish they had the wcw us style belt.
1.0,It doesn't fit will
1.0,Won't recommend to anyone.<br />Absolutely wrong sizing chart. The fabric is ugly. Dumped to garbage on arrival.
1.0,This dress doesn’t look like the picture. The colors were dull and the fabric was cheap. Definitely returning.
1.0,"Buyer beware. I don't believe these are real Dr. Scholl's socks. The name and the small dots on the bottom have already fallen off with one use. They are not thick at all and very thin. I used the black socks only once and they shed all over my bedding, carpet and stairs. I will be calling to see if I can get a refund. I am very disappointed in the quality.  Save your money."
1.0,"Why sell something that will never work .you have to buy other parts to make it work.i HATE to be tricked DO NOT BUY ,,,,WON'T WORK,,,,,STAY AWAY..."
1.0,Broke the same day I wore them sad.
1.0,"Cross doesn't stay in the infinity, had to stop wearing mine, it kept falling off, got what I paid for."
1.0,"NOT even close to photo, AWFUL material, not accurate at ALL sizing"
1.0,"Poor quality, broke shortly after kids played a little bit. Poor quality, waste of money, not worth buying."
1.0,Ended up throwing away.  My girlfriend is a small in most US clothing.  She is thin not short.  These were so tight on her skinny legs.  I do not recommend.
1.0,Bad design hate them! Feel like I’m wearing a garbage bag!
1.0,"The bottom of the sole is ripped off and my son hasn't had them for 5 months, they're cheap boots...."
1.0,Paid a healthy bit of money for this considering it was used.  Got it and they failed to mention that it has no glass/plexi like.it supposed to.
1.0,Ugly on
1.0,"cheap material. design does not look good once on body, at least in black and white"
1.0,"So I bought it and if I didn't have as much booby it would work, very sexy work,but it work. So sadly it's to small pretty design tho"
1.0,"The look great and are a great price. Ordered a pair, came in bent and crooked. Asked for an exchange/replacement, the same issue with the second pair. I wish they weren’t so defective. I don’t recommend, unfortunately!"
1.0,They flake and turn my finger green not happy
1.0,"I was so disappointed when I received this skirt. My daughter wanted a black pleated skirt,  and in the description it says pleated. Not even remotely close to the description. Not metallic and not pleated. It's an a line skirt and the material reminds me of a black trash bag. Thanks a lot for ruining my and my daughter's Christmas."
1.0,"To start this — I did not order this expecting the utmost quality obviously but this is very innacurately described.<br /><br />1. It is no where near 30” long. NO WHERE. in the first photo I included you can see the necklace next to a measuring tape and it is 23”.<br /><br />2.  The end of the chain does not have a proper ball closure as shown in the photo from the advertisement. It just sort of ends. Also, The clasp does not close without you forcing it to once you hook it onto the other side. Whereas most necklaces with this design close once you let go.<br /><br />3.  The necklace came as seen in the 3rd photo — outside of the packaging just floating around the envelope. It was clearly packaged like this because the sticker was not tampered with making me think this was returned for the same reason and not even repackaged properly before sent out again — the necklace doesn’t stay closed."
1.0,"Super low quality, broke in like five minutes"
1.0,"Fragile, teeth broke off while unpacking. Heavy. Impossible to wear with ties provided, kept loosening."
1.0,ARRIVED DEFECTIVE. IT TOOK ABOUT 5 MINUTES JUST TO LIFT THE CROWN TO TRY TO REMOVE THE PLASTIC WHITE BATTERY SAVER. ONCE IT WAS LIFTED IT CAME COMPLETED OUT OF THE WATCH. COULD NOT USE IT AT ALL.
1.0,I wanted to like theses but they ride up all the time.
1.0,"I was so looking forward to this watch because Ive wanted a brown watch for a while. First of all the watch did not appear in person as it appears online. Instead of a rustic or old world feel, or retro vintage as it's listed, it just looked old and the color appeared faded prob due to sitting around for a long time. The second problem was that I decided to keep the watch and wear it anyway but it stopped working in a matter of days. Pretty disappointing."
1.0,I like it but it runs very small
1.0,Very small for a women's sock and I wear a size 7
1.0,It came in broken...
1.0,Essentially the product just looks cheap
1.0,It doesent look like the picture poor quality
1.0,Sole came off after 3 months..
1.0,"It looks really fake and is very bulky. i would not recommend this, not even to someone that I hated."
1.0,I really don't like this dress. The sleeves are too long.
1.0,"These bonnets are so stinking cute, but they are very durable. I washed them as soon as I got them, because youre suppose to wash them, before using... and they had holes when I took it out of the dryer... So I ordered more to return and washed and did the same thing, I would not recommend"
1.0,the eyeglasses seal keeps slipping.
1.0,Runs very small order 2 full size up
1.0,This “dhoti” is not a dhoti. It is much too small to fit on any grown man
1.0,No really a fan of these insoles. They just feel very uncomfortable in every shoe I've tried so far.
1.0,Glasses left the side of my heads green.  Do not buy these. Worst purchase I have made.  Do not buy these
1.0,I will be returning the jumpsuit. Did not like the material.
1.0,I didn’t like anything at all
1.0,"Lightweight means cheap. Breathable means you can see through it. Large means long in the legs and small in the waist. This was a total miss on these SPOSULEI Men's Sweatpants.<br />I guess I should have known better when there is no sizing chart. But usually you can be pretty close with sizes for men when you are going by standard sizes (S, M, L). The large waist is more like a medium. The length is more like a XXL.<br />If you are tall and slim, these may be for you."
1.0,Cheap material.  Not flattering at all.
1.0,Not worth the money.  Tarnishes quickly.  Might get one good use before it looks trashy.
1.0,Don't do it. Bottoms are see-thru and the fit and fabric are awful.
1.0,"Wore them once, washed them and found a huge hole in the waistband seam. Can’t be worn again without being reseamed."
1.0,"The photo shows a deep blue, almost a navy blue. The actual product is a bright teal or turquoise color. Very misleading photograph. The quality of the product materials though seemed good, but the low rating is because it ended up being a waste of my time with having to return it."
1.0,Tried to contact seller it keeps opening dropping my badge not secure and seller never responded. Not durable it opened completely in less than 3 weeks. Poorly made
1.0,Really not worth the money. I'm gonna get a refund. These things are plastic I'm pretty sure. They are really chincy. Not good. Don't do it.
1.0,"I chose this rating because the scarves are of very poor fabric, and seem chinzy, not very nice at all. Putting them in the kids dress up box. But as I stated, you get what you pay for."
1.0,fit is large on the waist and small on the chest.  Very odd shape.
1.0,Very cheap material!! :(
1.0,"Unfortunately their L/XL..was too tight for my husband who has a fairly normal palm size. .and I asked them I want to exchange,  reply comes ..i will have to pay the return postage which is more than the price of product.(later I asked if they have a bigger size...and the reply was NO.)"
1.0,"Don't waste your time and money to get this hat, took  24 days to get and was not  like the picture, will not order from this seller again !"
1.0,I unfortunately ordered two boxes of 50. And got two 10 packs. And they where not individually wrapped. I'm 80 short and no real hop of reciving them any time soon
1.0,Everything was broken apart when reviewed
1.0,fell apart with only one wearing.  total junk seems failed.
1.0,Item stopped working within less than an hour of purchase
1.0,"Material not as expected, runs small arm bands too small"
1.0,I have another pair of Circus by Sam Edelman shoes which I love SO much.  It’s a slightly different style but are so comfortable and cool.  These?  Not so much.  Not comfortable.  Not stylish.  Returning them ASAP.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Horrible material. Like wearing a plastic shower curtain. Did not fit at all.
1.0,Nice looking but too small unless you have tiny fingers and for a bonus turned my fingers black after wearing them. Obviously not pure copper
1.0,1.5 size....More like 3.5...Way too big. I guess my son will have to grow into them 2 years down the road. LOL
1.0,"Bought these thinking they’d be cute, but they’re extremely hard to use, and you when you pry them open to put them in a piercing, they never go back to the shape they’re originally supposed to be! Unusable and impractical."
1.0,Not a fan. The front part wouldn’t stay on my daughters foot and her foot kept sliding out then she would trip and fall.
1.0,"Compré talla M y me quedan muy muy grandes, y esa es mi talla. Además, los boxer que estoy usando tienen más compresión que estos. Una verdadera pérdida de dinero. Lástima que esté fuera del país, sino pediría mi dinero de vuelta."
1.0,Not good. Not flattering. Had to send it back. Cheap feeling
1.0,If you’re gonna buy these then learn how to sew. I’ve had these on for four hours and I already had to run to Walgreens to buy a sewing kit to sew up the first hole which was huge on my calf but now I’m seeing the thread come a loose on the hip and near the stomach. If you’re thinking maybe there’s too tight then don’t because i actually should’ve went down a size because they’re big in the butt area
1.0,Way too small. I ordered and XXL and it didn’t fit my kids
1.0,The top was okay but the bottom wasn’t stretchy at all. Ladies if you have a butt don’t get this in your actual size.
1.0,What a waste. Can get better quality at walmart
1.0,This was of good material but I usually buy XL for my husband and so i bought an XL in this but it was way to small therefore this was a waste
1.0,"Absolutely no give to the material, especially around the chest.  I wear a 36c cup and purchased the xxl - way too small.  Wanted to love it, but the sizing is way off."
1.0,Did not like this item at all .. Too close to party date to return 😞
1.0,Love the colors but they run really small I ordered the xx-large but they fit my daughter who wears a medium.
1.0,Didn't get to wear theses to long until the sole completely came apart from the shoe. Very poor quality and the fur looks very cheap. But I guess I got what I paid for. I ended up just spending the money on bear paws they are worth the money
1.0,Very small. Can NOT use it. Don’t waste your time and money on this. Not even and child can fit this on. Bad product.
1.0,Cheap and didn’t hang right for my body type. Need to have certain kinds of curves.
1.0,My jacket came smelling perfume. Did someone wear it before? looks like thin plastic
1.0,"Purchased strap and used it for an international trip. Upon my return home, strap clips and plastic adjusting piece had broke rendering strap useless."
1.0,"I wanted to use these for Christmas, but the posts were broken"
1.0,"I had been looking at this bag for sometime, read the reviews, even the ones about the odor, but decided to take a chance anyway.  I received the bag yesterday and I am returning today.  This bag smelled like fish when I removed it from the plastic covering.  I have had many handbags in my lifetime, never had an issue with odor whether it was leather or ""something else"". Very disappointed because I really liked the style of this bag, but there is a saying, ""you get what you pay for""."
1.0,"Received these earrings and while I understand that they are natural stones, one of the earrings is so much different than the other that they look silly when I wear them. Very pretty but the particular earrings I received don’t look right bc one of the stones sticks out quite far while the other stone is mostly flat."
1.0,"Cheap looking, poorly constructed, not worth it"
1.0,After wearing the watch for little over 12 hours it was a hour behind. Beside that it looked like I wasn’t the first owner. The watch was nicely wrapped in plastic but the bracelet was thrown in the box without being wrapped and the tag was also loose in the box and not on the watch. It came in an envelope and you can see in the pictures how the box looked when I opened the envelope. Definitely used. I took screenshots from this review just in case it gets deleted.
1.0,I returned these glasses in early August with the ups drop off option and keep receiving notices that my card has been recharged because the return has not been received.  It is now October and I'd like confirmation of where the glasses are based on the package tracking.
1.0,"Awful! I received it today, the design is peeled off and stuck together in some areas."
1.0,Low quality materials.  Fabric snagged while adjusting straps then rear clip broke all on the first time of use.
1.0,"nothing fit well top part so so off of the chest.  Really wrinkled, Ive shipped it back."
1.0,"Not as pictured. Weird, stiff, stretchy material and it’s shiny. The stars are not navy blue as shown, the shirt is like a shiny silver, not gray! Returning!"
1.0,"I was really excited to wear this body chain with a bathing suit on vacation. Upon trying it on, the chain instantly snapped apart at the slightest pull! Horrible quality do not buy!"
1.0,"When others are saying this is &#34;totally see through&#34;, trust them and not the sellers photos."
1.0,Broke almost right away
1.0,The material for this dress is cheap and quite tough.  The pads in the bust area show under the material and it provides no support and I'm a B cup.  I am definitely returning this item as it was a waste of money.  The dress is cheap and thin.
1.0,Ear pieces are not adjustable and don't sit well
1.0,Arms did not fit the sizing was way too small
1.0,Apparently there are different sizes and this one is to smaller than the one I had and doesn’t fit.
1.0,"Jacket was too small, hood was too small to fit the head. Hood wouldn't buckle and pull string snapped right off, no movement at all too tight on shoulders"
1.0,"If I can give this -5 stars I would. These are the cheapest, poorest, ill fitting sunglasses one can even buy. Honestly, it’s something you would pick up from a .99 cent store. They’re just overall poor for more reasons than my time is worth explaining."
1.0,Weird material that does not feel good on body.  Not a professional look at all.  Way too cheep looking.
1.0,The socks seem ok enough but the description is misleading; only one pair is sent if you order the brown.
1.0,The rubberized fabric on the inside of the jacket and lack of arm pit vents  cause a build up of moisture & discomfort for the wearer.  There should be a nylon inner liner  and vents
1.0,The skirt arrived really wrinkled and now I will have to pay a dry cleaners to hopefully get the wrinkles out.
1.0,Decent material but stitching and print is poor. The side seams were crooked and had weird right angled bumps sticking out of the hips. Also the seams were lumpy and uneven.
1.0,These are darling and I expected them to last more than 24 hours after being taken out of the package. Unfortunately the bows fell apart while being hand washed. It’s like whatever thread was used to affix them completely disintegrated.
1.0,Fits way smaller that it said. I am a size 14/16. I ordered a 2x shirt. I couldn't even get it on.
1.0,"very pretty earrings, way smaller than expected and SUPER tarnished. I don't know if they were a return or just crappy quality control but they are smudged and tarnished with something dark"
1.0,Pretty but the small handles broke the 2nd day
1.0,"I loved it, but unfortunately it broke (the metal watch connection came apart on one side and cannot be fixed) right after the return window closed. This is too much to pay for a band that lasts just over a month with occasional wear."
1.0,Received my necklace and the chain was broken with the clasp missing. Little disappointing.
1.0,way too big getting a med
1.0,I didn't get the colors I wanted 😕
1.0,Bad belt. The buckle keeps falling off.
1.0,"When sunglasses were received, the lenses were out of the frame, despite the fact that the package was not damaged."
1.0,"I got this rain jacket about a week ago. I always get shirts and jackets in size XXL so that they'll be loose fitting with plenty of should room. The first thing I noticed about this jacket is the shoulder area is extremely tight and the arms are too short. As bad as that was, the hood is even worse. I have a big head, I've never had a problem with hoods fitting before. This hood is big enough for two heads!! If I wear it loose, a slight wind blows it off my head. If I tighten the strings. the hood covers all the way down to my upper lip. I think it was designed for a woman with a beehive hairdoo."
1.0,"This backless, strapless bra was way too small. I went by the sizing posted and the reviews and it was still too small. It seems to stick ok, but it does not hold my chest up. Pretty bummed that I can't even use this product"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f6b6c65307ff7b6ff08f79a4073efd0a]] this apron is nice design but very hard and stiff. needs to be a softer material. I have washed this apron 6 time trying to ge it to be more playable. It’s an awful grade of denim.
1.0,"Cheaply made. Fabric was very cheap (sheer) and the flowers were not attached upon arrival. Colors are not as vibrant on actual dress, either. It's a $5 dress, at best. Wouldn't buy again.<br /><br />*Edit*<br />They did give me a few dollars back for ""my inconvenience"", which was nice. However, they want me to change the rating as well. I appreciate that they tried to make it right, but the dress review still stands."
1.0,Bar is to short.
1.0,"I always wear a size medium.  Looking at the reviews I ordered this skirt in a large since some people mentioned it runs small.  Well, it did not even come close to fitting.  It seemed that they might have put an incorrect label on this skirt.  It should have been a label with the size small.  It's too bad, the skirt's quality was nice, but  that does not help if the item is sized completely wrong."
1.0,The bags have a horrible smell. I don't know if the smell will ever go away and is repulsive.<br />The interior of the large bag has a lining that feels and looks cheap.<br />I know the size was posted but it just looks a lot smaller than I expected.<br />Just not what I expected.
1.0,lases  break or knot slips through silver holder
1.0,We got these to work with our dog and he is a pup less than a year and these fell apart in less than 24 hours.<br />They would be ok maybe for a bird to perch on but not much else. Would not buy again.
1.0,"I ordered this because of the good reviews and then received mine today...  It looks like it’s falling apart and I just took it out of the package.  Cute swimsuit design, but it’s completely coming unraveled at the waist!  And the top is huge on me!  This is a normal problem for me when I can’t purchase separates though, as I’m a little bigger on the bottom.<br />I’m terribly disappointed in this suit and I leave for vacation tomorrow.  Even though it was relatively inexpensive, it was definitely not worth the money."
1.0,"Not at all according to sizing stated in the description, width and length significantly smaller, would fit only a child."
1.0,"Hate the fabric, it's a cheap knock off. Waste of money"
1.0,"Edit: the below is what I wrote when I put them on. Rated them a 2 star. Now after wearing a day, I bumped down to a 1 Star. They don’t stay put well. There is a little bit of silicone on the heel but they are just not what is advertised.<br /><br />Not what I hoped for. You can put them on and make them look like the picture but they move on your toes and end up no longer being no show sock. Not worth the month. You can get the same thing at Walmart for much less."
1.0,My wife bought these for an event at a school.  As soon as the kids touched the sticks they began getting fiberglass slivers.
1.0,"No Star for this! This must be kids size 8-9. So tight I can barely put them on. I bet they will split soon! X large....LOL No way....they would not even be in the category of the a large size!<br />The Extra large Mens sock is like a small or a kids extra large. I have to pull it really tight to get it on. I am a size 8. It will not last long. I feel sorry for someone buying these with a 9-13"" foot"
1.0,Cannot figure out how to size what band
1.0,Thread already began to become undone.
1.0,"Updated: Cannot be used as a wallet. Can't put in US currency without folding. Can't close properly with more than a couple credit cards. Holds phone securely, so I will try for a while just as a protective cover. Interferes with our somewhat weak cell phone signal at home when closed, so I had to lay it open all the time. Ditched this and got a different one that has a wider spine to allow more stuff in wallet."
1.0,I don't liked bed bed
1.0,Not what I expected. Doesn’t look like the pic
1.0,"Very disappointed in the clutch I received. Is not leather as advertised, such is what I wanted. Seems quite cheap. Did not fit the description. Of all my amazon purchase's this has been my only dissatisfying purchase. Now I am unsure about buying anything else through amazon"
1.0,Could never get the clasp to work. Still sitting in my chest of drawers. Never used.
1.0,It looks nothing like this..the one I received was ugly and more brown....i understand that they are not all alike and each one is different...but something similar would have been nice
1.0,The material is extremely uncomfortable and non-breathable. I can't imagine sleeping comfortably in this. It's also small comparatively to the sizing described. Definitely would not recommend.
1.0,I've had this band a month and it's already fallen apart!!!! The pin that holds the chain bracelet onto the part that clicks onto the Fitbit broke!!!!! I will not buy from you again.
1.0,Bad quality m!
1.0,It is not 100% cotton as advertised. It is 100% acrylic
1.0,The T shirt  DID NOT  FIT AT ALL LIKE IT SHOWS ONLINE.... was not fitted and the sleeves were shorter and the neckline was higher<br />I returned the T shirt... but I have Not received my refund....<br />I did like the color
1.0,I thought they were really pretty but broke the first time I took them out of my ears. Returned.
1.0,Ripped when I put my first few credit cards in it. Very disappointed.
1.0,Poor quality and NOTHING like the pictures.<br /><br />Don’t order.
1.0,"Going to return it.  Cheap, terrible quality, I am not happy about wasting my money."
1.0,Imitación no original
1.0,The mouth doesn’t open and the more is no clasp in the back to hole the slot closed. Very disappointed.
1.0,Color is very dull.  The decal looks like cheap iron on
1.0,They looked like they were dipped into some varnish and it was wearing off. Not happy with them at all. They were a gift and I was embarrased when she opened the box and looked at them.
1.0,"What i received is not the model in the picture, but a cheap, cheese, completely different clasp wristband. I am disappointed with false advertised pictures."
1.0,WAY smaller than I expected.
1.0,If you have large breasts then just forget about this dress. I returned it.
1.0,Arrived on time.  It appears to be &quot;used&quot; with scratches on the locket and some kind of mud and or grease on the loop. It has uneveness (lumps) in some random areas (crap craftsmanship). I will say the clasp is hearty though..took me awhile to get it open.<br />Im going to clean and use for myself but if this were a gift i would be embarrassed. Hopefully its actually 925 silver.
1.0,Looks silly on a 61 yr old
1.0,Comfy but small and short
1.0,"These shoes are super cute. They were the perfect style and color I wanted but holy moly, I can't wear these for more than an hour. They hurt so badly!! They cut into my toes at the opening and there is little support on the balls of the feet. Maybe if I ordered a size up and could fit an insert, they would be wearable."
1.0,Not for small waist people
1.0,The clasp that closes the goggles broke after only 30 days. We treated them well but the quality of plastic on the clasp is very low. I don't recommend this product!! Really bummed out!
1.0,Inner shorts are too loose.  On the first wash the inner elastic band twisted.
1.0,"No wonder this strap is to short, the instruction included are for a NATO style.  I bet they don’t know how to properly thread a 5 ringZulu.  You need to be longer to thread a 5 ring correctly"
1.0,I was going to set up a return because it is falling apart after using for a couple of weeks and the return window is closed. These are horrible.  It durable at all. Even if they were free. They are cheap and a waste of money.
1.0,Cheap China rip off. Wash them one time in cold water and  it shrinks .<br />Walmart cheapest Tee fit better than this .
1.0,Wore these one time to work and my feet were soaking wet. Very disappointed
1.0,The bag quickly tore apart after 3 weeks. Could not handle much weight inside. I usually carried my laptop and a small journal for school and it first broke from the long strap that made it messenger then it began to pull at the sides completely and tore apart. I didn't hesitate to throw it away before I took pictures. Instead I bought a nice fossil bag for $30 more.
1.0,Too small and length also short. Stripes didn't match up at seams.  Color is as depicted. Returned item.
1.0,Lost a tassel the first day out
1.0,Very low quality product. The thread used to make it was very scratchy. It also runs big and the material stretched out. Would not recommend.
1.0,Cute but where to short I'm about 5'9 -5'10.....
1.0,I had bought a pair of these 2 years ago and came back to purchase another pair. Well they are made of the scratchiest material I’ve ever worn. Feels like cardboard. Definitely not as good as the ones I purchased 2 years ago. Returned these!
1.0,"Not like other similar ones. These were very snug, making it hard to breathe."
1.0,These were so small (more like a child size glove) so very disappointing
1.0,"Do not buy these for children, they are way too big. My kids are 8 and 5 and have rather large heads."
1.0,It runs smaller than normal
1.0,I ordered this for my wife. the dress looks like a Halloween costume
1.0,I normally wear an extra small. I ordered a small and it’s still crazy small. Don’t know who is sizing this product but they need to take a second look.
1.0,"Terrible product - very, very, very hard to put on and take off. I fear they will cut the circulation and therefore be dangerous. Unfortunately I bought this these for my 87 year old aunt and she didn’t try them on until yesterday which was after the return period. Terrible product, don’t buy ‘em!"
1.0,My dress arrived inside out with deodorant stains all over it (I hope). I thought I was going to be receiving a new dress not something that someone else returned.. YUCK I don't know how it fits yet or anything I have to wash it before I can even try it on! What the heck!?
1.0,Fell apart. the screws just fell out of the glasses leaving the lens sliding. DO not buy. If you do first thing to do is  put crazy glue on all the screws to prevent them from coming out.
1.0,Not even close to the size in the picture super small but the colors are the same
1.0,Cheap looking earrings. I am returning not only because they look cheap but so late in delivery. I ordered so long ago that I did not even remember ordering.  When I checked my order history it said:  Expected between end of August and September 17.  Said shipped on August 5th and arrived October 7th. Not acceptable.
1.0,"I ordered size up and was very surprised when the size large arrived so tiny that I couldn't even try it on. I'm 125 pounds, 35- 36 inch bust and the large size was still too small. So sad."
1.0,3 x  ha  ha ha not even a size 40 seems to be good material.
1.0,"I bought these for the filter pocket. These things are standard. It's not hard to make them so they fit in  here correctly, but they don't. Maybe they were trying to use the too small size to make a sort of air pocket but look it doesn't work. You buy a gaiter so you can quickly pull itup and down. This is bad."
1.0,"I did not like the fact that these classes were cheaply made. I did enjoy their cheap price, but still. It’s not good to have a pair of glasses that will break quite easily when you put them in your bag."
1.0,turn finger green
1.0,"I ordered two of these for my guests when they stay because the bathroom is not on the same floor as the guest room. The first two both came with giant black oily stains on them, right out of the package. I returned them and ordered two replacements. The two replacements are not even close to the same robe. One is soft like rabbit’s fur, the other is the normal, expected terrycloth. They are not the same color, texture, or design. They do not match at all and I need to return them YET AGAIN. Amazon makes the return process a freaking nightmare so I can only return them for free if I’m: home to greet the amazon person (never happens), or I want to drive myself all the way to the south of the closest metropolitan city’s Amazon locker- Despite there being TONS of Amazon lockers within walking distance of my house."
1.0,Pearl fell off horseshoe before even wearing them
1.0,"They look so cute in the picture, but the material was wierd...sent them back."
1.0,Poor quality cheep material
1.0,"If my head was the size of a watermelon, this hat would still be too big. I look like a 4 year old trying on dads hat.  Most of my ears are covered by the cavernous maw that is this hat.  It would fit if I wore it over a football helmet.  I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s a big hat, fyi."
1.0,"The material is so thin, after one wash, it started to fray.  Really poor quality"
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture at all. I had to throw it away
1.0,I love the sparkle on the cover for the face of the watch. It’s very hard to take off and sometimes moisture gets trapped. I hate the band it’s slinky and slippery. Hard to adjust the tightness when it’s on your wrist and the clasp constantly opens which makes the watch fall off. I would return it but I like the sparkled cover.
1.0,Toe ripped the first time I put them on. Fabric is cheap.
1.0,"I'm 195 lb 5'5"". I bought the 1x size, like the model. I got these shorts to match the shirt - also 1x. I'm disappointed with the shorts. I contemplated returning the shorts but love the fabric and pockets. I expected the shorts to fit me like the model but look bigger than pictured. I'll have to mend them to look as the one on the model"
1.0,Too small for any adult
1.0,"These are impossible to screw on, once you take them apart they don't go back together. In the trash the day I got them"
1.0,"cheaply made, rough material fits like a balloon, square and HUGE.  Save your money . . ."
1.0,"These shorts say they are 2x, but did not fit. They are way too small. Very disappointed. Will not buy again. A total waste of money."
1.0,Not as pictured. MUCH shorter and colors didn't match the advertisement.  Returned it...I was out of an additional 8.00 for that!!
1.0,"This beanie is enormous. Bought for my husband battling cancer,who is bald. He has a decent size head, but this beanie covered his entire face & folded at the rim. Good for people with dreads or long hair that needs to be tucked away,"
1.0,Didn't like the colour at all and it looked cheap
1.0,Forty dollar lenses with a 5 cent clip on mechanism. I used them four times. They dismantled twice.
1.0,Kinda bummed!! It said to size down because they run large. (I usually buy an xs in leggings this material) I got a small.. so a size UP and they’re still wayyy too small. They’re super long for me (which isn’t a big deal) but they’re too tight on my butt. Disappointed :(
1.0,"I have thick legs, they busted when I put them on."
1.0,"This is a wallet with a strap. Way too small to be a handbag, look at the dimension before buying it."
1.0,"Waste, I gave it to a friend who’s a string bean  LOL so disappointed. Ordered a 2x"
1.0,"I am a person who always looks for a bargain when I can get it. It's my natural assumption that price point does not always equate to quality, and that non-brand names have (in many cases) the capacity for being just as good as brand names.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in this case, that assumption has been proven false.<br /><br />This bag looks good on paper and in person. Functionally as a gym bag however, it fails. I used this twice, opening and closing the zipper 4 times altogether. On the fourth time, the zipper snapped in half in my fingers - not from exerting a massive amount of force on it, just because apparently it can't bear the pressure of a few instances of normal use. I didn't know solid plastic that was this flimsy existed. Apparently, the price point is set over quality of zipper.<br /><br />Bottom-line, I wasted my $10 on a gym bag I assumed was good enough. It wasn't. Don't waste yours unless you intend to decoratively display a non-functional gym bag in your home or have a fetish for products that break easily from shoddy materials."
1.0,"The shirt is fine, fit is good and nice feel to the material although it is a bit thin.  However after buttoning it up the sides hung about an inch off from each other....and I didn't miss a button or anything.  I'll have to wear it tucked in.  Disappointed ):  ALSO, if you plan on buttoning it all the way up it will look awful because they neck size is HUGE.  AND the collar doesn't go all the way around.  There's a 3/4 inch gap above the buttons and it looks ridiculous"
1.0,"I mean I get it. It's a silly costume hat. I definitely recieved a used item. I'm was very disappointed. Who knows what the previous person had, and why are there white stains on it? I don't even want to know!<br />The size is small on my head, I have a medium sized head. The black area is badly glued. It's very sturdy though. I'll give it that!"
1.0,Rough edges catches on clothes. Unable to wear
1.0,"Crap, took out of package and literally fell apart."
1.0,Very cheap material. Returned. If you do buy order about 3 or 4 sizes up. It’s Asian sized.
1.0,The stones were loose upon opening!
1.0,"Dress arrived used and covered in stains, do not buy!"
1.0,I swear this is like a fishing net it's ugly and cheap fabric it hardly passes for a shirt!
1.0,"Its really big and bulky not bronze at all, its completely gold with turquoise marking around it. I didn't like it I used it as a key chain because I thought it would be more dainty like a necklace."
1.0,"I received these items today and was horribly disappointed to find out these are SO small that they would barely fit a child. The ad said they would ship Medium and Large, and they actually shipped Large and X-Large. But the items are not for an adult. I do not recommend this product or vendor. Item returned the same day I received it."
1.0,Its just weird.  Definitely. 100 percent not the outfit in the picture.  Made weird. Feels weird. Odd material.  N im 5 ft 9inches.  Its made for someone short.  Just dont buy it.  Its like something you would get from WISH.  Just order from WISH if you want something weird.
1.0,I just received this scarf.. Color doesn't look like a picture.
1.0,Pile of garbage.
1.0,"This was awful. It was a weird Feeling material and didn’t even come down long enough. I’m 5’3”, so rarely do I have anything that is too short."
1.0,I wouldn't have purchased it if I had realized it was from china!!
1.0,Seller is from China they tried to make me ship back China and they only refunded me 20 cents! The product is trash and this company should be black listed.
1.0,Cheap and horrible quality. Do not buy!!
1.0,"The foam falls off, they are foggy, crack easily, do not create a seal, and the shape doesn’t fit my face at all. I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"thin, not enough compression - even for light socks"
1.0,"Have had this bracelet since September, and it comes loose from the hinge when I put it on. It's not good quality. I really can't wear it out anymore because if I do, I will end up losing it."
1.0,I ordered 4 sizes over my size and it was still too small
1.0,"The picture appears to be black socks, but the pair arrived nearly white, as if they were bleached."
1.0,The jacket fit nicely through the shoulders but the sleeves were cut way too small for the size of the jacket.  I will not buy from them again.
1.0,"i used the size chart and ordered a &#34;US M&#34; which basically would have only fit me if i was completely flat-chested.  i am 5'0 and measurements are 35.5, 27, and 37.5, which according to the size chart put me just 1/2 inch bigger than the small so i went with the M. in true US sizes i am normally S or XS.  THIS SUIT HAS NO SPACE FOR ANYTHING LARGER THAN AN A CUP!!!!! Ironically,  if this suit had been correctly labeled as &#34;Asian sizes&#34; or &#34;Children's sizes&#34; as opposed to &#34;US sizes&#34;, I never would've wasted my time ordering it according to the size chart.  However, the since the bottom seems to be sized according to the chart, it just seems that the designers forgot that most women have something called breasts."
1.0,"Cheap product -Stitching coming apart, looks worn. I’m returning it.<br />Too bad because the style is so cute!"
1.0,The image is super pixelated. The fabric is very plastic. I ordered a XXL for someone who normally wears an adult S and it was still way too small. I rarely leave negative reviews but after still having to pay $6 to return this thing I have no hoodie and less money. Lame.
1.0,Came with a small hole on the front of the shirt that appeared to be glued back together from the inside.
1.0,"I bought a 5XL so it’s nice and baggy, but when I go to try it on, it’s like trying to fit a large hand into a small glove...WAY TOO SMALL"
1.0,MY fault I thought these were headphones so I will hold on to them
1.0,Very small for a medium. Asked for refund to no avail..
1.0,Bro this was broken
1.0,"Really cheap looking (there is some exquisite jewelry on amazon for only a few bucks…but you only get what you pay for w/this one). It honestly looks like something you get out of a gumball machine. The opal looks like plastic. However, this would be a good option for a young girl wearing jewelry for the first time."
1.0,"Not a fan, it's tiny, and doesn't really look like the picture.  I bought the green one and it's pretty see through.  Sending it back... :("
1.0,Looks really cheap made
1.0,"Don't buy, these are a piece of crap. The sizes are all wrong, don't burn your money away."
1.0,"It didn't fit my back button or my volume buttons. It fit around the edges that was it. It would have been okay, but since I have an LG my power button is on the back."
1.0,"Immediately this jacket started coming apart at the seems. Every day a new hole in a seam appear. I bought this jacket before a three week travel overseas and so had no time or resources to mend and by the end of the trip one whole sleeve was almost off. Seams opened everywhere, even in parts with no wear such as the side of the coat. Very terrible and disappointing quality. Additionally the entire jacket began to pill. I just left it overseas, the amount of repair it needing was amazing."
1.0,It is a pretty set but have only worn it a few time but it is already tarnished. You get what you pay for
1.0,Very nice bands fits great .. was not the colors ordered
1.0,I ordered the small and adjusting all the way they are too big . I wear like a 29-30 waist . Man with 38 waist is trying them  and he has them adjusted as small as they go .
1.0,This is what I expect to get off wish not Amazon. The fabric is extremely disappointing and it doesn’t look like the picture other then getting the coloring similar. I’m done buying “cute” clothes off amazon. Out of the 6 shirts I bought I might wear one.
1.0,Missing the clasp and unable to be used! Worthless product!
1.0,"I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've use 2 different battery packs and this thing doesn't heat up.  Doesn't even light up (to show the heating mode).  Mine is most likely defective."
1.0,Very cute however the minute that i zipped up the jacket the zipper split open not good quality but u get what you pay for
1.0,"I should have read the reviews more closely.  What a sham!  As you can see from my pictures posted, FALSE ADVERTISING.  It clearly states 10 places for credit cards, etc and it only has 8!  4 double sides instead of 5!  If you are going to charge 6.99 for this item, DO NOT leave the original price tag of $1.50 on the outer packaging!"
1.0,"Doesn’t look like the photo, very cheap material. No shape just a tube. Poor compression."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:a98ab3d8cf4a0c03674eec0a8ca6d549]] 5’4”, 127lbs wearing size Small. the fabric is low quality polyester that feels and looks like a banquet napkin or tablecloth. it is basically two pieces of polyester fabric sewn together with an elastic at the neckline. the white is thin, see through, and there is no liner. the stock photo with the model wearing white shows a liner underneath, but there is none. it’s a disappointment, even for $20"
1.0,"This product has an accurate description, I only wish we would have read it and the reviews. It is a 99 cent toy and my son was incredibly disappointed when it arrived as we thought it would be much more exciting for the price we paid."
1.0,"It looks nice when I wore it for the 1st time. However, it shrink like crazy after the 1st wash at low. Beside shrinking it is very wrinkle after 1st wash"
1.0,Hole was too big and kept sliding around
1.0,the seams on the butt completely show and the waistband is way too tight.
1.0,"Bought a toddler 9.5, however received what appeared to be an adult 9.5. Will be returning!"
1.0,I don’t know why this was nearly $40. So tiny and dull. Found big beautiful ones at a trade show for $10.
1.0,Liked the pants but very poor stitching and zipper also came off
1.0,These give you plumber's rear end... Yes the XL fit me fine (until I bent over). They are so stretchy that some parts fit well and others move around. Like the waist and the hip area. Just cut that part off and wear them as leggings...Disappointed.
1.0,"I have maybe 5 things in my purse at one time, no sharp objects and The bottom of the purse ripped after only a week and a half of use."
1.0,"Very, very poor quality. As the previous review states, upon wearing once, both arm pits have a hole in them and there was a hole that appeared on the seam above the ruffle. I’m having to throw this shirt away because I can’t wear something with 3 holes in it even though it’s brand new. VERY disappointing."
1.0,Too high up on the ankle and difficult to push the feet in because of narrow opening
1.0,Super small and low rise under short.
1.0,"He has only worn 3 times, rust."
1.0,came with a stone missing!!
1.0,This is extremely too small.  It should not be considered for a daith at all.  Miniscule and not worth the money.  Should be half the cost for the size.  It is smaller than a finger nail clip.
1.0,Fragile The clasp broke as I was putting it on.
1.0,Do not buy the MK1. Cheaply made piece of crap
1.0,"Absolutely not sweatshirt material, tee shirt thin."
1.0,"This earing is horrible. It doesnt sit right on any of our ears (3 different people) the  earing is made so cheaply looking and we bought two pairs, and one the post was bent. Not worth shipping back to china. I will make sure I buy only when i read it ships from Amazon , so that we can ship them back with no problems."
1.0,"The description clearly states 95% cotton 5% spandex. Guess what......they lied! It's 65% polyester 35% spandex and it looks and feels flammable! It has a horrible sheen to the fabric and it drapes on your body highlighting every bump and bulge. It feels like that silky athletic type material, only it makes you hot and sweaty, like you're wearing a plastic garbage bag!  As if the misrepresentation of the fabric wasn't bad enough, the shirt has a spelling a error. It should say candles not camdles. You can't even blame it on the font, because there is a clear N in plungers. I am just so annoyed with manufacturers peddling misrepresented junk on Amazon! Hard pass on this t-shirt! Spend your hard earned money elsewhere! Send a message to these online retailers that we demand better!"
1.0,"buy this portfolio, knowing that their money would not be very good in quality, but the reality is that it is very very bad, not last even a week using it and it broke.<br /><br />I gave one star because it is the lowest punctuation, but actually not even deserve this punctuation."
1.0,"SMALL ,FOR A CHILD NOT AN ADULT"
1.0,Doesn't seem to be same material as pictured. Looks and fits like a bathrobe. More junk made in China. Not impressed with it at all.
1.0,My daughter lovED these boots until the soles came off only a month later
1.0,I need it for a little girl it is too. Big
1.0,The band does not fit the Apple Watch Ultra I tried several times but was concerned it would break/scratch my watch
1.0,"I would have expected a better product given the price.  The ring snapped on its second use and then she got away from me, took my paddles, and beat the hell out of me.<br />Moral of the story is that a collar is no good if your sub breaks out and beats you. 3/10 would not reccomend."
1.0,"This simple tool certainly is what is needed to replace boat shoe laces. It is too short for easy handing, however. Worse, I could not get it through the side and rear Sperry shoe passages until I used vice grips to give me sufficient force to get them through. Even  then it was a struggle. I am not returning the tool since it &#34;worked&#34; after a couple of hours of frustration. My advice to persons purchasing this type of needle is to purchase a longer one."
1.0,This was terrible. Front longer then back and one side of front way longer then the other.
1.0,These are not authentic hanky panky brand. I have the real ones and these are larger (one size fits all) and cheaply made. One of the pair was already fraying out of the package.<br />Very disappointed and not cheap.
1.0,"Super small, and is shipped from china. Takes forever and quality is less than desirable of both the shirt itself and the graphic on the shirt"
1.0,Broke as soon as I put on the first time!  Crap!
1.0,"This dress is not at all like the picture, and the sizing is way off! I ordered a size 10 and it is too small for my 5 year old. Returning."
1.0,No son para Garmin 4s
1.0,Item is not as pictured as a long maxi dress much shorter.It is also very low quality.
1.0,I bought this for my husband who wears a size 2X in all his clothes and they all fit him a little big. This vest is a 2X and it is very tight and he can't zip it up. The size chart is way off. Very disappointed.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,I wore this necklace only a few times and it broke. The company was great and replaced it. However after only wearing the new one once it also broke. I would not recommend purchasing.
1.0,Memory foam slides sideways so the soul of the slipper is not under your foot..looks good but horribly uncomfortable..I didn't realize all this and threw away the packaging.. now I'm stuck with slipper's that I can't wear..
1.0,If you want to look like you have the worlds longest crotch and no butt then these are the pants for you. Just trying them on destroyed any self confidence I had left.
1.0,"Cute, but the elastic on the shoulder loosened after one use."
1.0,Used one day and broke - the rubber piece inside became unattached to ribbon. Very disappointed.
1.0,The necklace itself is nice but the clasp broke the first time I tried to take it off.  Doesn't accept returns.  It's cheap.  I'm totally bummed.
1.0,Looks super cheap.  Too cheap.
1.0,Magnet is so strong.  Skin often pinched when putting on; painful and left with a red pinched mark.
1.0,Broke the second time I wore it.  Big thumbs down.
1.0,Increasingly small width. Fabric is very thin. Looks like a knock off from 20 feet away. Wore once and fabric pilled
1.0,"Not worth buying. At that price, should have known better."
1.0,They took a bit to arrive. I was expecting cheap material and that's what I got. The only problem is that they were not matte like the descriptions says. And one more thing. This pair came with a big glue stain that dripped from the bottom to the middle of the lense.
1.0,"Bought these to use with my various mules, and sling back flats.  I wanted these to work, I really did. Unfortunately, they would slide off and bunch up under my feet.  Didn’t matter which shoes I was wearing.  They just don’t have enough grip to stay on.  I bought the correct size, they just didn’t work.  Ended up throwing the remainder away."
1.0,Not a deal at all. Broke within 20 minutes
1.0,Very poorly made and cheap.
1.0,"I’m sorry but the material is a no for me. Also,  the clothes do not look like how they’re advertised."
1.0,No es de oro
1.0,Cheap clasp it broke trying to lock it together.
1.0,Started tearing at the seams after the first wash so I just threw it out. Too much hassle to return it.
1.0,"I received these glasses YESTERDAY! When I opened the shipping package the case was crushed in on one side, the Coach emblem came off on one side AND the lens on one side is scratched! I’m going to be asking for a refund. If it wasn’t for those issues I’d absolutely love them, so disappointed."
1.0,The product states it comes in assorted colors. If you consider 1/2 of them being the same color as assorted then we have different definitions. Would not recommend ordering unless you don’t mind getting 6 of the same color.
1.0,Very small and does not fix
1.0,"This bra is not at all for high impact sports. Tried it on this morning and the straps don't go up far enough for a petite person. I wear a 38DD and thought it would be a great thing to try a bra everyone else seemed to rave about, especially those that are in the DD cup range. It was disappointing the bra did not hold up, tons of bounce. The material is thin and squeezes my breasts together -- into a uniboob.  Perhaps this bra is best for people who are taller than 4'11 and much smaller than a 38DD. Normally, I wear the Juno bra, but thought I'd at least give this a try.  I wouldn't recommend this particular bra for anyone my cup size or height. It was a very beautiful pink."
1.0,Washed it once and the stitches are already coming off
1.0,They  have air gaps everywhere. They are useless. Trust me. I wanted them to work. Not sure why some say they work.  I guarantee they don't.
1.0,"I ordered the Koozon nat. pearl fox pendant necklace, not only was the necklace over a month late, but  i was sent a Pinbo necklace that i find tacky and very poorly made.  I will never wear it nor can i give it away as the only person i know who would want it is a four year old and I would be afraid of peices falling off and her choking on them.  oddly they inserted a picture of the Pinbo necklace in my list of orders that when clicked upon pulls up the picture of the very Koozon necklace that was originaly ordered."
1.0,It looks great but the magnet could be stronger.  It feel off my wrist and shattered the face of my Apple Watch.
1.0,"I really wanted these to work! They give plenty of coverage and they are really cute! However, they are not as soft as I’d expected and the waistband and leg bands were a bit tight and scratchy. They were cutting into my skin. If I bought a size up they would be too big in the back. For reference, I’m 5 ft 8/137 lbs.and wear a size 4 jeans. I bought a medium..which was a great fit except for cutting into my waist and thighs. If the waistband was lace it would be more comfortable and probably not cut into my skin."
1.0,I wanted to like these but the fabric was not to my liking and they weren't long enough for me.
1.0,Do not buy this dress.  Way too short for average height people.  Do not buy.  Dress is too short and I have to pay shipping to return.  Don't buy!!!!
1.0,"I order a 2xl. The shirt was entirely too small it fit my son, who wears an xl youth perfectly"
1.0,Not size given
1.0,Feo y de mala calidad
1.0,I didn't receive the first one they sent but received a replacement super quick.  Wore it one day and looked down on my way from from work and it was gone.  I have no idea when or where.  I have an office Job.  It was a very pretty bracelet and looked expensive.  I was so sad when I saw  it was honwy
1.0,"I never got this. I got one panty hose sock and then another &#34;single&#34; panty hose sock. Took me forever to realize who or what sent this to me. And now I know since I never got this necklace that is was probably this. Weird thing is before I ordered this silver one, I ordered a gold colored one and it showed up and looked fine. But I didn't report it or care because of the price. But I will tell you guys so you know you may not even get it."
1.0,"I used this only 9 months, if it’s leather it will go maybe 5 years, it’s expensive just for 9 months, they are deceiving the people, don’t buy!!!"
1.0,Weird looking stitching to sleeves...returned.
1.0,Liked this watch fine until it stopped working after 7 months. Would not buy this brand again.
1.0,too short and the clips are smaller than a standard size fanny pack clip.
1.0,I bought these for my husband for work and he didn’t like them at all. He said they felt heavy and stiff. And the button broke the first day wearing it. Would not recommend.
1.0,Not worth the money....<br />The post came out of pearl after a month!!<br />Would NEVER buy jewelry online again.
1.0,"They are comfy and loose fitting,  but after wearing them only 3-5 times they started developing holes. I attribute this to a poor quality of fabric. Not worth the money."
1.0,Crop top. Awful material. Sizing was accurate.
1.0,"i didn't realize that Ray-Bans sold out  too, but these are made in China, frames are spindly, lenses are decent but lacking performance like the justin gradient made in ITALY ones I have. Gave these to my daughter, age 7, and she even says they're not dark enough."
1.0,"It doesn't work, I charged it all night and when I wanted to use it doesn't power on unless I have it plugged to the wall."
1.0,These rip so easily. Literally like paper. Ugh
1.0,Looks chipper than I expected. Glue all over the bag
1.0,Way too small. Sizing was way off.
1.0,Must be plugged in to work. Useless outside. Tried to return but the address was “ not known .” This was using the return label company provided us. Don’t buy.
1.0,It came in the mail broking
1.0,"Runs large, not made in USA. I though I was getting made in USA because of the USA flag. The flag is not situated properly on the mask."
1.0,WAY bigger than tha picture. Looks like a bees honeycomb on my face.
1.0,Received damaged. Looks like it was part of a stack that was bound way too tightly. There were two permanent spots on each side where the leather was pulled inwards. I was almost going to exchange it but when I looked at the item it said there was only 1 left. I figured the very last one had a good chance of having the same problem since they might have both been stacked at the bottom. Very disappointing since I searched through so many bracelets and cuffs to find one I liked!
1.0,"I know you get what you pay for, however, I did not expect them to rip the first time I wore them. Super cheaply made!"
1.0,Haven't even worn them and the stones are all falling out
1.0,Very cheap looking material! Very! It looks like a Beetlejuice Halloween dress.
1.0,It didn’t look like the picture at all. I could have made that dress myself
1.0,"I'm a 2X, but I wear a 3X because of broader shoulders, and most shirts tend to be long on me.  This shirt didn't even make it down to my belt, it was that short.  Another inch shorter, and I could call it a belly shirt.  Instant return."
1.0,I had to return this item as damaged it was cheap too king for the price to
1.0,"it's plastic and too small, what the picture show it's not real"
1.0,"Not as good look as pic shown, the CZ stone size is not specified, very tiny, price is not good, bought another one at much lower price but looks more pretty."
1.0,Total waste of money!
1.0,Horrible quality. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,You could not take apart or put together. Not a good product
1.0,These are horrible. Completely a lie. These are sweat pants. Not jeans. Sizes must be in kids sizes. I ordered 2 sizes up and they were still small. Zero stars
1.0,This runs really small. Like it only fit on my 12 yr old neices pinky finger. Had to stretch it so the design isn't so visable.  Not pleased. Would fit perfectly on a tiny 5-6 yr old girl
1.0,When I opened the packaged I found that it was a lady bug hat and not a santa one. There wasn't a reciept or any paper with the product.
1.0,Heed the poor reviews...these are cheap and useless &#34;anti-glare&#34; glasses.
1.0,"The hem curls at the bottom, and trying to iron it out doesn't help.  It's nice material, but I can't get past the curling."
1.0,Cheaply made. Arms constantly fall off
1.0,"I ordered the XL. My daughter is tall and slim and I buy XL in Gap/Target/Old Navy to fit her lengthwise, even though the width is roomy. However, this leotard had an XL tag but was so small that I did not bother to have my daughter try it on. Instead, I returned it."
1.0,The color that is showing in the picture has nothing to do with the one you are getting
1.0,The product came tarnished! I Returned the product. That is not what was shown on the picture of the product.
1.0,Flimsy fabric.  Raw edges.
1.0,Bad product bad cuality
1.0,It’s so small a baby could wear it fashionably. No adult could get it around their head without breaking it.
1.0,"This looks very cute on my 8 months old daugher, and I thought it's a good price as well.<br />However, I put the bow on my daugher for 10 minutes and when I took it off, there was a red line around her head, and her head not big, it is an average size, very disappointed that I have to throw that away."
1.0,Want to  buy American made masks.
1.0,The size says 3T 4T but it's not an exact match
1.0,"Belt is made cheaply, not leather but plastic or vinyl strap. The buckle is made with cheap rivets. My belt came apart while walking into work, lost 2 of its rivets in the buckle. Get what you pay for garbage,, would buy if I were you"
1.0,To tight at top to wear over boots
1.0,"My grandson works inside a freezer in a grocery store. He wore only the 35 below docs because I assured him it would be fine. He had to leave work to get two more pairs on, as he usually does. I do not recommend them for extreme temperatures. VERY DISSAPPOINTED."
1.0,"These look like unfinished scraps. The ends are frayed, not even sewn. Garbage."
1.0,Dress fit fine but arm holes are literally child sized.
1.0,Do not buy these boots!<br />No durability and it will rip and eventually hurt your feet.!
1.0,"These are called ""womens"" well they are not they are mens!! Not happy at all I needed them for a special moment and now I don't have them. Very unhappy customer"
1.0,I DIDN'T LIKE IT....CHEAP
1.0,Sizing is completely wrong as usual. This is a problem with all of the Chinese companies. The size XL is more like a size 6 for women. Does not fit at all. Oh if you are in American with an average body you will not find this in your size. The very largest size is too small for someone who isn’t even overweight.
1.0,"I love the dress. I needed it for an event on Saturday and I ordered it with time. It came today and it has a hole right in the front of it.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed with this. I will be returning it, but it doesn't help my situation for Saturday."
1.0,Do not waste your money on these. They rip and tear way too easily. I can get one maybe two uses out of each pair and then they need to be thrown in the trash.
1.0,"I absolutely hated this jacket.  The picture is cute but when I got it, it was nothing as expected.  It was thin, no lining and the shape was a bit funky.  I wouldn't wear this to work or casually.  This was a waste of my time.  I returned it, immediately."
1.0,"This strap itches terribly. I didn't have any trouble with the original band or my old Jawbone, but I cannot wear this strap for more than 2-3 hours at a time."
1.0,The product displayed was different from the product delivered.<br />They were also in one colour!
1.0,"The headband popped without being stretched much after less than an hour. The band is very pretty however, I put it on and it popped within LESS than an hour of putting it on and not touching it. The stones on the fron of the headband are so very flimsy that it couldn't even be tied so that I could keep the band on for the night. Big disappointment!"
1.0,"Everything fit great but the red leotard isn't made for anyone who has a bust. If you are flat, you should be good to go. If you aren't, don't have any expectations that it will fit at all because it won't."
1.0,This is a knock off and not even close to the 35 below you get in store. They are very thin and don't work at all. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Too small for men this watch is for women or kids.
1.0,All 3 that i ordered broke within a week of wearing them. Do not recommend anyone buying these
1.0,"To much big , very hard plastic, and its come without box ( sunglasses box )<br />I just love design only , that's way I but one star"
1.0,I went by the sizing guide and it was way off. The vest was at least two sizes too small in the bust. I normally wear a women's XL. This was supposedly a US 2XL (Asian 6XL) and it was definitely smaller that that--more like a large.
1.0,Love the feel but out of three pair two came with holes. I bought them and packed them for vacation and here I am with holes in my pants.
1.0,These earrings are not sterling silver.  They change after a few months of wear.
1.0,This necklace broke on the first day my daughter wore it. She brushed her hair away from her neck and the necklace fell off.
1.0,I got this half bandana for work but it's way too big. It wont stay on so I don't get any protection. The description said unisex it's useless.
1.0,"The gloves are complete and utter trash. The shirt is ok, I bought one size larger than I usually wear and it’s still small. The material is mediocre at best, the hat is maybe the only good part but it comes all wrinkly and messed up. Good for maybe 1 night of use. But maybe a little overpriced."
1.0,Very poor quality! Top of boots are very thin. A big price for this ankle boot!
1.0,"I am a size 10, with an hourglass figure, usually a Medium but I bought this in Size Small. It fits in the sleeves but the cloth from my back down to my waist and stomach is too baggy and shapeless, looks very hideous on me."
1.0,The advertisement was misleading. I was suppose to recieve an assortment of heel plates. They were all the same size. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Too small for my 90-pound mother. Too much of a hassle to return. Will donate these and buy her decent gloves at a brick and mortar store. Waste of time and money.
1.0,The size run smaller than stated
1.0,The product comes unzipped and runs small. Coukd not keep the zipper up. Hard to put on so I never bothered to wear it. I am returning it
1.0,"I really wanted to like these sweatpants, they look nothing like the advertised picture. The material is nothing like pictured, it is very thin, clingy and cheap looking. A review I read stated the guy was 6 feet tall and the sweatpants was a good fit. I am 5 feet 10.5 inches tall and the sweatpants was to short for me. I could not give this to the person I purchased it for, due to all of the above. I would not purchase this item, picture and information very misleading!!!"
1.0,They are TINY they may fit a 3 yr old. But not my 8 yr old let alone a 15 yr old!
1.0,It was made incorrectly. The straps were stitch in front of the bust  and the top part was inside out and on the incorrectly attached. It took two months to get here and now it defective.
1.0,Would not recommend. First slip of my knife while whittling and I ended up with a 3/4 inch slice in the palm of my hand deep enough to require stitches. Blood everywhere. Would I expect them to work like armor? Nope.  But I’d expect them to make a difference.  Can’t imagine it being much worse had I not been wearing them.<br /><br />2-1 deals aren’t worth much given the quality of these.
1.0,It fell one time and the flower fell out
1.0,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this dress. The waist bow fell off in less than 10 minutes. Fishing line was poking through and hanging out in several spots. I had to fix it and tie it and melt it to keep it together. Also, I usually always wash clothes before wearing them. Thankfully I didn't because after one wash the Santa face was completely pink and the sleeves weren't red anymore, but pink. Terrible, awful quality. I'm just glad I had only planned on her wearing it on Christmas that one time and didn't wash it first. So it served its purpose."
1.0,Used it for one day and it broke.
1.0,The studs won’t stay on! I wore the flower and in less than 24hrs it had already fallen off. Super disappointed that I’ve lost 3 because they keep falling.
1.0,"Bracelet arrived with a broken clasp that could not be fixed, had to get a completely different kind installed."
1.0,"Not a huge fan, the cross will not stay in place no matter what I do to it.  I tried it wear it yesterday and it fell off of my neck three times before lunch so it went into my purse.  I know it wasn't a lot of money so I can't complain but until I can figure something out it will stay in my purse or it will be lost.  Probably would not purchase this item again."
1.0,Buttons were not centered!
1.0,So I ordered according to the chart and I'm scared to even try them on.. maybe the pants will fit on my arm
1.0,It was boxy and made from odd material. Dont buy.
1.0,I don't like this product.  Inside card capacity not enough.
1.0,The pins didn't fit.  I was unable to use the watch band.  It kept falling out.
1.0,I just Received 2 masks from 4<br />I’m so disappointed  that happened with Amazon
1.0,This is simply a piece of hosiery with cut open  ends. The ends have no seam and are unraveling upon opening.
1.0,Ordered these in a size 16 for my daughter they run very small... shes actually a size 14 but I got them a size up since I ordered them online. I loved the style though....
1.0,The title claims its for women and men but they arrived are small for kids like 4 and under ..mostly toddler size :very disappointed but was able to give it ::my niece very cute socks but meant for toddlers..so be careful
1.0,"Item size was really off. Bra didnt fit, straps were too long. I would have to but a xxl pls a large just for every item to fit"
1.0,"Although this hat fits well, it falls apart when toughing hat. The stitching comes undone when touched just by removing from box and taking out of bag. Unbelievable was of money."
1.0,I didn’t like this pair ... It moves in my ear piercing .. Not comfortable...
1.0,Was excited about how good this band looked.  However it broke and my watch fell down to the pavement.
1.0,They don't fit at all. The plastic thin lens isn't great but I was happy to have something finally on my favorite frame.  I knew someone put 1 star but gave it try and they didn't leave a review just rate it.  We shall see how this return issue goes. Fingers crossed.
1.0,I didn't like the material and it was too small for it to be xxl. I am so disappointed in the product. Why was I sent another pair. I wanted them returned they didn't fit and I want a refund
1.0,Pretty skimpy.
1.0,Does not work!!!! And the package was torn apart. I contact the seller and they never got back to me. DO NOT BUY THIS! YOU WILL BE MAD!
1.0,My son wore his pj’s and then I washed them and they shrank! Not just a little either😡
1.0,It broke a few days after I received it
1.0,No yellow nor is the flower big enough.
1.0,Made in China. Bad idea. They have no idea what a cat looks like
1.0,"Don't waste your money. The quality of DKNY bras has gone down hill drastically. The sizing is too large. The fabric is cheap, flimsy, and itchy and the hardware squeeks all the time."
1.0,Too exspensive not to work
1.0,causes horrible blisters on your skin
1.0,"Product had glue from glue gun very visible all over it. Did not fit the head correctly. Appeared very cheap. It was for my daughter's project so I did not need super high quality, but this was way below expectations. Not pleased at all."
1.0,"It broke within 2nd day,dont even know, where i lost it, completely wasted my money. Dont even try....."
1.0,Terrible quality dress!
1.0,"Size was confusing because of the description but what we got was either of the sizes offered, mich too large!"
1.0,Ugly makes me look huge
1.0,Very cheap. Started to fade by the end of the night (first use) but it is cute.
1.0,Runs very small and completely see through
1.0,"I really wanted to like this but it came out almost a yellow color, not a flattered fit with the sleeves either"
1.0,"I choose large because the sizes for the size was my size but for some reason it was too big, is there any how I can get small or medium"
1.0,Looks like the top to a pair of PJ's
1.0,Read through description and reviews that said these were not see through. They are 100% see through. Pretty disappointed in that. Not what I thought I was getting.
1.0,The xl looked like a xxxl.  The material was very odd.  It was not soft and felt fire retardant .  Returned.
1.0,It’s too tight even though I brought a size up and the v neck is too low and it’s not soft on the skin
1.0,The material feels nice and they look attractive but I can say nothing about how they feel when on for I couldn't get them on in any way shape or form.  They are not just too tight instead they would not go up past my upper thigh.  I wear a medium or large in underwear and I got these in a large.  A waste.  Honestly I have never come across clothing that was so off on the fit.  Cannot recommend.
1.0,I got this for teaching and its pointless it fogs up and you cannot see your mouth.
1.0,"First of all I would not call them a snowshoe  I mean if there is more than an inch of snow your feet are actually getting wet , it's not a waterproof shoe!!!! very cheaply made"
1.0,These earrings are much smaller than I expected.
1.0,"These are tiny, like a children's sock. They stretch to fit, but make my toes feel compressed. They are also thicker in the toe area which makes my shoes feel tight. I'm a long term smartwool fan, but these were a big mistake."
1.0,The dress was short I don’t know what happen and also to small and I order Xl so it could fit good
1.0,Looked great. Looked forward to wearing on vacation. BROKE the first day!
1.0,These earrings are extremely tiny. Suitable for a baby are very young child
1.0,Skip it. These guys must have huge heads for this to be considered a small/medium. And they charge you for sending it back.
1.0,The dress arrived with a hole in the seam and extra thread was on the strap. Unfortunately it looks much nicer in the picture than it does in person. I am definitely returning it.
1.0,Very disappointed in the fabric and color
1.0,"I ordered the large, though the tag says XXL. I'm 5'10&#34;, average/thin build and it comes to a couple inches above my knees, which is about what I was expecting.<br />What I was not expecting is that my entire butt would be exposed to whatever I'm sitting on while wearing this robe. So, beware other tall people, you will have to wear shorts or something underneath this to maintain any sense of modesty. I also -- silly me -- was expecting it to come with the belt, as pictured.<br />I'd return it, but it shipped direct from China and it's not worth the hassle and expense to ship it back. Perhaps that was their plan all along.<br />It was only $15 but I will probably never wear it, so, one star for &#34;I hate it&#34;."
1.0,"The bottoms are made to fit a doll, not real women. The top fit though"
1.0,loved but the bracelet broke in two after I put it on
1.0,Literally only one of the arms was sewn. Absolute waste of money
1.0,String too thin. Rolls up tummy. String was partially shred on 2 upon opening package. Wasted $ n can’t use this
1.0,Ugly color. Sleeves way too long.
1.0,"It's a $15 knockoff of either an Omega or Tag bracelet. It's not great quality, the pins aren't great, it's kinda loose fitting and I don't trust their springbars. Would I rather have a TungChoy Oyster, hell yes but it's also $70. Buy this for a quick style change and as a gateway to a quality bracelet if your unsure if you'll like a steel bracelet. Otherwise it's probably not worth the money.<br /><br />4/10/17 Update -- I've been wearing this bracelet for a few days now and the biggest complaint I have is that if I move my wrist 'down' -- try to touch the palm of my hand to my forearm, it will trigger the clasp release and cause the bracelet to become unbuckled. You can't reverse the bracelet on the watch either as you can still cause it to unclasp. Don't buy this as it could come undone and fall off your wrist."
1.0,Did not fit had to return
1.0,Arrived broken didn't send back because of how cheap they are... get what you pay for
1.0,"The photo looks like these pants are black and white when actually they are taupe and black, plus they are not the real Vocal Brand made in the USA like i thought i was getting. They're cute but material not as good as real Vocal and the color is off. Maybe worth $20 instead of $57"
1.0,not good in any aspect..
1.0,I got this sweater neck way to small. Asked for exchange. They said keep the small they would send me large. Kept checking my account for delivery of new sweater and said was on the way. Should of had it now but when I check my account the claim Is closed.  I would never buy this sweater
1.0,Terrible. As soon as I slipped into my wrist it broke all over the floor. Very cheap
1.0,Ordered a 5T and I’d be surprised if it was a 2T!  It was HILARIOUSLY SMALL!  Sent back don’t waste money on it!
1.0,"This is actuallly comical.  True to size?!  NO WAY!!!  I wear a Medium in women’s, 5’3”, 145lbs.  Ordered a large because it said “juniors top.”  This is more is a XXXL!  I could put 2 of me in this top!  Neck is super stretched out as well.  I mean, I guess if I was looking for a dress this would work.  Very disappointed!!<br />And now they want me to pay shipping to send back!!  I will update after I fight that."
1.0,Design changed from previous order.  What fir beautifully before won’t fit at all with the redesign.  Fabric cut differently and now hangs awkwardly.
1.0,It didn't fit right.  Too difficult to return. Charged for shipping which wasn't returnable even with my AmazonBabyReg Prime membership!! Watch who seller is before you purchase. This probably isn't the only seller who does this.
1.0,Little tight....wasn't impressed with the texture of the material. Disappointed
1.0,These boots are not for little kids. I ordered a size 3 &#34;little kid&#34; boots and what I received was an item for a young toddler at best!
1.0,broke in a week
1.0,"Coofandy (I've purchased a few of their clothing items) has really disappointed me in terms of quality, and this item is no exception. The zipper completely broke after one gentle wash and dry. For $40 you can get a much better quality men's one-piece jumpsuit from a different company, just look around. I can't believe they tried to sell this outfit using the zipper construction that they did; the quality is reminiscent of the cheapest $5 clothing item you can get at any chain supermarket.<br /><br />$40 wasted and lesson learned."
1.0,"I bought a bunch of these T-shirts because I loved the cut of the first one I received.  I put several black and grey ones into frequent rotation and purchased a couple of colors that looked good in the pics.  I came to discover two things: after a few weeks of wearing them I'd noticed that my skin was becoming irritated frequently when I wore them, and especially when wearing them to work out in.  This surprised me since they were described as 90% cotton very clearly in the description.  They also retained body odor more than I'd expect cotton to.  All of this prompted me to do what I should have when I got the first shirt from them...check the label.  It turns out the actual shirts I received (numerous) are only 30% cotton and the rest is Polyester and Spandex! Furthermore the colors I ordered, Wine Red and Blue, do not remotely look like the shades of those colors represented on the website.  Not even close!  The red shirt I received was a bright tomato red, rather than the burgundy wine that is shown on the site. The blue shirt I received is a bright almost turquoise blue rather than the subdued blue depicted on the site.  This is not a matter of minor color differences that can be explained away through inaccurate photography/profiling of monitor etc - these colors aren't even remotely close.  Clearly the listing needs updating, especially the materials. Currently they are grossly misrepresented."
1.0,"just go to walmart if you need a cheap watch, they'll look better and be more durable"
1.0,Straps are very small. Even my 5 year old can't wear it by herself and remove. Very tight to put it in and take it off. We need to help them.
1.0,This dress is horribly made. I bought 4 of the for my family to all wear for Easter and 2 did not fit and the other 2 started ripping under the arms and the seam. Don't waist your money.
1.0,"This is a nice sweater, not the nicest material, but not terrible. It IS true to size, thick, and warm.<br />This took 2 and a half months to be delivered, I wasn't able to cancel it when I got sick of waiting."
1.0,Every pair split down the front when washed on delicate cycle.
1.0,Outfit is a cheap piece of garbage. Returned it and pkg came back as address unknown and in big red letters saying SCAM
1.0,I thought the product was very cheaply made. The material used is very thin and a plastic type.
1.0,To wide and pinches the nose to hard magnetic to strong feels like its crushing my nose . Can't even wear it waste of money
1.0,Right sleeve is shorter than the right sleeve.  Lopsided.
1.0,"These shorts run way to small, & they gave me a diaper booty fit. I will not be purchasing again. Had to return"
1.0,I returned this dress as it is cheaply made. This was not a nice shade of brown either. The fact that it had pockets was the only thing I liked about it.
1.0,Size is way too small. I have purchased many shirts lately all 3x. They all are even a bit big.
1.0,"Awkward to latch and unlatch, looks nice!"
1.0,These are about a 1/2 too small.  Ordered 13.5 and they fit like 13.<br />Tossing in the goodwill pile.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"The title has stainless steel but they are not. Of course further down the page it has they are made of alloy (didnt see that when I bought them, which I suppose is my fault). I should’ve read the entire thing, but the title shouldn’t have had stainless steel. Turned my daughters fingers green and a couple have already broken. Only had since Christmas."
1.0,It didn’t fit right and the sleeves where to short and I’m not tall I’m 5 “2 and still not good 5
1.0,"Took the shoes out of the bag and both noses fell off. I glued them back on with super glue and they have stayed ever since. However, upon wearing the shoes a couple of times, I have lost 3 out of 4 ears. I do not recommend this product."
1.0,I ordered the xsmall according to size chart and this thing is huuuuge. The material is also horrible. Not at all like the picture.
1.0,Compared to DryMax and Injinji these socks are terrible. They are much thinner and I'm already showing places where I know the sock is going to come apart after only 8 or or runs.  They also give me mad blisters on anything greater than 5 miles which is basically all of my runs.  I'd expect more out of a sock with this cost. My only regret is that I didn't try to return them before the window closed. Now I must live with one of my greatest mistakes.
1.0,Horrible.  Sheds terrible.  Worse than a dog.  Washed it once.  Didn't help.
1.0,Very thin material  Cheaply made
1.0,"Don't buy this product, is cheap made and does not have any bra support. I am 36B and It does not fit confortable and it looks horrible."
1.0,"The bow on the back wasn’t in the center when it arrived. It looked silly & im pretty sure it wasn’t meant to be off-center. My mom was able to remove it and sew it in the center. The tag says machine washsable gentle cycle but after the first wash, the tutu frayed! Lots of stars are falling off as well. Pretty leotard, but not sure my daughter will even get two uses out of it! ☹️"
1.0,Well first off I’m  a 13 got a extra large to be on the safe side. Yah not!!! Also the right leg outer seam was in the middle of my knee on the front! So needless to say extremely dissatisfied.
1.0,Had a very harsh chemical smell after talking to the seller suggest I let it air out for a couple days did not change..<br /><br />Gave a very prompt and courteous refund..
1.0,Not worth what I paid for these! I bought two pair and my sister and I both don't even wear them
1.0,"In general the quality of this band is good. However, the problem is that to put it on or take it off I have to remove the band from the watch. This is because it is so small that it won't go over my hand. I fear that in addition to this being difficult to do with only one hand (since my other is unable to reach back that far) it will most likely wear the connection point on this very expensive watch with so many band removals and re-attachments,"
1.0,Came late and is too small for an adult wrist.
1.0,"Seriously, I feel bad for any baby that might have to wear this. The fabric is so awful!"
1.0,"This does not fit true to size, although I don’t believe any size would have worked"
1.0,"When my teen daughter tried this dress on my first thought was ‘hopefully someone else will get some use out of this’.<br /><br />We got the X-Large but it was tight, so I'd say it runs small. We asked one of my teen’s rail thin friends to try it on — which is when I realized the cut of this dress is just not flattering on anyone.<br /><br />Simply put, this dress hangs funny, so much so that it actually makes me laugh when I see it on others.<br /><br />The material is light weight.  Color good.  Cut funky."
1.0,These sunglasses broke on my 3rd day of using them. At first i loved them but the frames broke very easily. there are many cheep sunglasses that are good but these just aren't.
1.0,"After 1 month of wearing it the rubber bands around the magnet got worn-off, the color got black. I shouldve bought the apple one. Its cheap and the quality is not good."
1.0,"When I received these I showed my daughter she was so excited and I was to until she tried them on and I got to looking at them. They had some scratches already on the lenses and although it is rubber and flexible you still want it to fit and sit straight on there face. Well these did not I tried my best to get them to work and look good on her and I could not get them to not be crooked.  Which I figured that was going to be the case when they didn't even sit level. These have a little bag case that comes with them to they would have been perfect but, even getting them in new and having a few scratches on them I was turned away. I would have a total different review on these if that was not the case. I received this at a discounted price for my honest review."
1.0,It's not detailed like the picture it looks like it's fading once you get it  I returned it AS SOON as I opened it
1.0,"I was really dissapointed when I received this product since I read great reviews on it and the seller. When I received it it had scratches and parts of the gold missing in a lot of areas even though it looked new. This tells me this was very poorly made, not like how it was described. The white clover part was all lumpy and the gloss put it on was also lumpy and missing on some areas."
1.0,It doesn't stay in the ear.
1.0,Terrible they broke after i put them on
1.0,Not easy to use.  I cannot get the rings to close with the rind-stone ball and am very disappointed in them.  I would not buy them.
1.0,The prior reviews were extremely misleading. It’s not a evening gown by far and the cut is abnormal. I’m 5’4 120 lbs and it was weird fitting from my tiny frame.
1.0,"This is not an infinity ""circle scarf"". This matetial has to ends and is not continuous."
1.0,"They are very wide and too long for a cropped shirt.  Because it was sent from China, we are unable to process an easy return."
1.0,Fell apart in 3 weeks
1.0,Please buy something else
1.0,"Great look but poor quality. I’ve worn 3 times to work, have not washed and they are beginning to separate at the seams. The cargo pockets are starting to fall off. Material is super thin. Disposable pants."
1.0,"I was surprised when these arrived today.  I read through many of the reviews, and they were so positive.  The angels are backwards - so when they are worn the angel wings are what is seen.  There were also reviews that included pictures of a display card - the way all earrings are sold in stores.  Mine were loose and just sitting in a tiny plastic bag, taped closed.  There are not what I was expecting and I'll be sending them back immediately.  Look elsewhere for better items."
1.0,"I hesitated about spending $65 on a beanie, but I've been trying many different kinds and none were a good fit, and they would bother when on my bald head. Now, we are talking San Diego weather here, not Alaska or New york winters.<br /><br />When I received and put it on I knew right away it was a keeper: Zero itching, extremely light but close stitching so no cold air filters. Overall, it ""disappears"", meaning while it protects my shaved head, you don't feel it is on. Not too tight, not too loose, just a perfect fit. Super nice feeling in the skin.<br /><br />Quality, fit and finish are excellent. My only quibble is the color, who knows maybe I'll get used to it, but it is really not my favourite color, and the seller does not offer other colors. At least it didn't when I ordered mine.<br /><br />The question that will be answered in due time is about cashmere: I'm just hoping it won't pile-up with use, because the stitching looks very good. If it becomes an issue I will update this review.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would buy this beanie again ten times over, that's how much I love it.<br /><br />Update 8 months later. With very light use as San Diego is never freezing cold, only chilly in the evenings during the winter season.<br /><br />Basically my love for this beanie and everything I wrote previously stands. I thought it would last me for years, but sadly that is not the case: for no apparent reason whatsoever, two small holes developed in different areas and are getting larger, and in looking closer I can see how more holes are starting to develop.<br /><br />My head is of normal size, the beany fits easy, not tight at all, and there are no cloth eating moss in my home. And I have no cats that can poke holes in my clothes.<br />So I am very disappointed with this expensive beany. When new it looked perfect, not a flaw anywhere, and now, after wearing it just a few dozen times these holes developed.<br />Pity, a real waste of money.<br />After my experience I would definitely not recommend it, and now that this company is false advertising a product claimed to be made in Scotland when it is actually made in China, and of polyester I would even less recommend it.<br />Very nice description and words of their beanies, pity they are not truth."
1.0,Too small and i ordered a XXL. It looks like a medium at best. Will return.
1.0,My daughter loved the purse but zipper got caught in material & pulled the zipper teeth out.  Dissapointed
1.0,Felt as if I was being suffocated with this thing on.. I thought my time was up when my life flashed before my eyes bcuz this thing prevented me from getting air..
1.0,"Sizing is not correct, you must size up"
1.0,"I really liked this bag. Then after three months, the should strap clasps broke. Travable customer support was incredibly responsive, and ended up shipping me an entirely new bag. That was a month ago. The same clasps broke."
1.0,I’ve worn this dress once. Zipper broke.
1.0,"First the sizing is way small. But whats worse is all the pairs fit differently. Secondly, they are horribly put together. Theres uneven fabric cuts everywhere! Just cheap, dont buy!"
1.0,This jumper has very poor quality material. It does not look even close to the model in the picture. The company was good about refunding my money.
1.0,Item was way more oversized than advertised. I'm not even going to bother returning it since I cant leave my house with a newborn so hopefully I can shrink it and possibly take it in. Extremely disappointing because I was very much looking forward to this dress
1.0,I ordered the 3X and it fit like it was a medium. It is WAY WAY smaller than it should be
1.0,Chain broken broke 2nd time worn...😕
1.0,This shirt was ganas maid poro<br />Its not good material<br />It also was itchy material<br />Poor Poor
1.0,"I didn't like it,looks much better in the picture than in reality"
1.0,"I like the way it looks and the way it’s made both are very nice. The only real problem is that there seems to be no magnetic properties at all! I’ve had other bracelets that would attract metal. This one only attracts lint and dust. I really like it and products like it but there’s no magnetic properties in this thing at all. Maybe I just got a bad one,live and learn."
1.0,"My grandson loved his cap, wears it even indoors.  He loved the bright orange color. It was a hit.<br /><br />mom mom"
1.0,Material came pintched like a pulled threat.
1.0,I purchased a black watch band with white accents which is what is displayed in the picture. I received a white band with black accents in the wrong size and with a different pattern.
1.0,"These socks are large/extra large, for someone five ft.tall that wears a size 7/8 shoe."
1.0,The top looks different than the item I ordered. The material comes together in the middle where the time I thought I ordered looked like a deep scoop neck.  I have A long torso so I’m glad I went with the large however I’m a 34 almost D and the top was a little larger than expected. Material was nice and the inside was lined. Just wish it looked like the picture.  I will Be returning it.
1.0,it lasted two days.
1.0,Fabric is hard and tight. Doesn’t hold much smaller than it’s described
1.0,"Be aware, Officina Del Tempo is no longer in business and company which acquired them is not servicing their watches."
1.0,"In my 36 years of living, I have never seen a shirt that has such bad quality. The smell when you open the box was rancid and there was a big tear in the middle of the shirt. I have never seen something so disgusting, does not fit the description at all!! I will never be buying from this shop again."
1.0,"Just received my zip up hoodie and extremely disappointed.  This is that gross Slinky polyester material - not suited for zip-up hoodies in my opinion.<br /> 65% polyester ?? more like 100% polyester ...  I normally wear a small but will order a medium for a slightly loose fit.  I decided on a small based on the size chart and some reviews but this is huge!! I'm 5'3 and weigh 136 lb. The camo size small fits like a large. And the polyester makes it hang horribly.<br />  There is absolutely NOTHING flattering about this hoodie.<br />went right back in the bag and started my refund process.<br />  If you like gross Slinky polyester material as your zip up hoodie- then this is is definitely for you!<br /> Otherwise,<br />  👉I DO NOT RECOMMEND 👈"
1.0,"The straps did not stay tight on the glasses. Wanted them to be snug to hold secure in the head, strap clips wouldn't stay tight. Very disappointed.  Will look elsewhere."
1.0,Paper. They are paper. I've never seen anything like them. Hard pass. Returning.
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl for extra flowiness. I typically wear an XL, I ordered the olive green, the fabric is very soft, but it is also extremely thin and see through, I thought it wouldn't be an issue for the green an it is, also the thin fabric clings to your body and shows every detail (fat rolls, love handles and all) despite being very loose fitting. I've ordered other similar styled dresses from Amazon that had thicker fabric and I love them, this dress as a disappointment, do not recommend"
1.0,"Really soft & washes well. The zipper has broken, part of it is missing so we cannot do the zipper up all the way."
1.0,These clearly say pockets and there are NO POCKETS. Your header needs to be clear about what you mean by pockets. This was a WASTE of money!
1.0,Not what is pictured at all! Not even functioning!
1.0,"This set is not made of linen - it's a polyester & viscose (rayon) blend, which means it's hand wash only. Rayon is an exceptionally weak and cheap ""fabric"" made of wood pulp, and it bleeds very easily. Linen, on the other hand, is stronger than cotton and can usually be machine washed and ironed with no issues. I did NOT want a suit set that has to be hand washed and can't even be hung to dry because the material tears too easily!<br />Also, I ordered my son a size small. He is 5'9"" and 135 lbs, very athletic but slim build. The vest barely comes past his waist, but the pants are a 38/32? A 38"" waist on a small? Very disappointed."
1.0,it broke the second I put it on
1.0,I am surprised there were great reviews. i bought the red dress based on th reviews but it isnt flattering. The material is uncomfortable and doesnt lay nice. looks like a homemade dress.
1.0,I wear a large so to be on the safe size I order one size up thinking that would help. But to my surprise even with one size up it still didn't fit.
1.0,It didn't even make it on a 10mins ride home before the this cheap strap was already rolling up. It feels and looks like it is about to break apart after one ride home... the strap won't last 5 rides before breaking altogether.
1.0,"Crap - did not like the fabric, fit, there are too many gaps between the buttons that run straight down the front."
1.0,If<br />You don’t have stomach or bug<br />Waist it would be fine. It’s really cute in person. I just think I was too big for it. Small waist line can pull it off.
1.0,These pants run small must buy next size or two up .
1.0,"Very short torso, runs way too small"
1.0,Band was short and cups not size accurate. Too small
1.0,This is a horrible top it's being returned 😕

1.0,Wrong dress. Sent it back.
1.0,much smaller then i had anticipated
1.0,"I love this dress/cover up and the color is beautiful. It's just too small. It's at least one size too small, maybe even two since it's supposed to be loose and flowy. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,Runs small by a few sizes and paper thin material
1.0,Very clunky and didnt fit well.  Very cheap looking in real life.
1.0,Really really bad product. Wrong sized and it will roll down once you sit or do certain movements. Wrong material explanation.
1.0,Not the same dress. The one I received is white and totally see through.
1.0,Can purchase better quality in the Dollar Tree for a lot less.
1.0,"The dress was unflattering and frumpy, and made from a fabric that reminded me of a fabric shower curtain. It looked cute in the picture, but in person, nope. The company was gracious and good to deal with, but unfortunately the dress was a disappointment."
1.0,This outfit is HORRIBLE! The material is super thin and it feels like paper towels!! Worst or the worst! Don’t waste your time and money!
1.0,No no no...will not be wearing this out looks like a used rag...material would be better used for a pet blanket
1.0,This smells horrible! Arrived with an extreme moth ball smell. So gross.
1.0,"Mailed it the wrong place 3 times. One time the one Jesus was gold dust instead of silver. The Jesus are not even close to the same size. The black hair one, the stones will fall out. You're going to want to switch chains too because the ones they come with are form a vending machine. Worked for need but went in the garbage after"
1.0,"This is nothing like described. Not sure how you’d even be able to wear it - it’s literally a cheap piece of flammable material down to another piece. Worse part is, I requested to return weeks ago and have not heard back. Just submitted a claim to Amazon."
1.0,I don’t think it is 18k. Bend turn into copper
1.0,"Very cheap material,,,,,,"
1.0,Comfy! Loved them….. until the zipper broke the second time I wore them. So disappointed!
1.0,Not what I purchased. It came with red hearts on it now I won't match. Waist fits like a small child. I would return but it says I can't 😑
1.0,Just didn't fit & drape of the shorts was wierd. Mostly leggings showing with material over
1.0,"My original order of these shirts, I ordered 2XL and what arrived were at best large.  I returned them and tried again and the same thing, so I guess these things are like 2XL for a 5th grader."
1.0,This was a great hat and I liked it the only problem was I got a big fat dose of lice!!! to go with it. warning do not  where any hats from Amazon without washing them first.  Stupid me figure  something brand-new was actually brand-new
1.0,Material super cheap and thin. Had to return
1.0,I’m 6’5 280lbs the jack fit but the “leather” looks like plastic it’s good for a costume but looks really cheap. The should have made the faux leather look distressed
1.0,this thing arrived shattered :-/ would be best in a box instead of the plastic sleeve.
1.0,I purchased this item from another source and it was beautiful. Unfortunately it was too small so I gave it to my niece and order this one through Amazon. It is printed poorly and is missing several parts of the printing. I would return it if it wasn't for the $8.37 shipping I would have to pay both ways. I didn't even want to give it one star that is how disappointed I am.
1.0,"You can't tell from the picture, it is a wide unnatural looking gold band with a very thin line of stones down the middle"
1.0,"I returned this as it didn’t fit properly. It also didn’t look like it was even the right shirt. It also said on the tag that it was 70% Merino. I thought it was supposed to be 100%. Unfortunately, Amazon never gave me the credit either."
1.0,size not as advertised.  buyer beware.
1.0,"One of my earrings broke the first day I wore it, and it was so cute."
1.0,Had to return. The strings kept untying. Could not walk properly in them.
1.0,Never think about it<br />I throw it away
1.0,This &#34;one size fits most&#34; is nonsense. Even with 3/16&#34; thick foam tape added inside it's still way too big.
1.0,poproportionally wrong for anyone under 5'5&#34;.
1.0,See through and too small. Horrible quality.

1.0,This dress runs smaller then sizes. You get what you pay for!
1.0,"Updated: Forgot to add the puffs in the front of it, they are 2 puffs tied with a white shoe lace. Oh and the laces are whiter than the sweater it is an off color.<br /><br />The first thing is the smell it is really strong, this is a gift and I cannot put this in a box and give it away without washing it first. The next thing I noticed was the material it is made of, definitely a no for me it is not like the pic. To me I picture material that is like a blanket and stays smooth after a wash but this looks and feels more like a blanket you thought was that kind but it actually gets ugly after a wash, also it's thin. Last would be the ears they are placed in the front of the hood not in the middle. Overall I was expecting more but it was a disappointment."
1.0,"It is nothing like the picture.  I'm a tall, slender man and cannot fit into this thing.  It's basically a small polyester neck wrap.  No front or back panels.  Look elsewhere."
1.0,This is not a compressive shirt...your better off buying an Underarmour shirt.
1.0,Very sheer and not the right size
1.0,Wig looked better online once i got it though i was throughly disappointed. the cap barely fits over your head and the material of the cap is so cheap and flimsy.Wig was true to color but it sheds like dog hair. i only needed it for one day and it served its purpose but i won’t purchase another one.
1.0,Pequeño y malo
1.0,Soft material but much too large in the chest. I ordered a small
1.0,I purchased these mask as a back-up to those I use at work.<br />I laughed out loud when I opened the packaging. There was nothing to them.  They appear as a piece of flimsy cloth with holes cut in them and a seam up the middle.  VERY poor quality and highly over-priced.
1.0,The game flap in the front and the color were very disappointing. Item was returned for this reason. Not the size.
1.0,No me ha llegado nada a mi casa
1.0,Sorry but hat is really ugly. Was fine for head and ears during cold weather.

1.0,This ring turn my finger green
1.0,"I ordered this dress for a party that i had and I wasn't in the country when i ordered it. By the time I made it here, I didn't have time to return it but it was see through so i couldn't wear it for the party. It was a waste of money because i never used it and now i can't return it."
1.0,This dress was way to long in the back and the material is very cheap not worth the price
1.0,And poor quality
1.0,"This was not what it said it was..... It's plastic charms. Not vintage coins, plastic. I will not buy anything from them ever again...."

1.0,Didn't fit or flatter. It seemed to add weight to me.
1.0,"Low quality, see through fabric"
1.0,This is super short! No where near the length shown in the picture. My undershirt hangs below the back of this sweater.
1.0,It might look okay from far away but this replica is really bad quality. The bead that was glued in the middle was all crooked and just looked terrible. I returned it.
1.0,Poor quality paint has rubbed off. Edited to add that bracelet broke as well.

1.0,"Received today, returning today."
1.0,Ordered a size 14/16.  It is equivilant  to a 7/8.<br /><br />I’ve got one sad child.
1.0,What a Sad representation of this blouse. The fabric is like a waterproof shower curtain fabric. The material is very loud and the color isn't hardly as vibrant as the online picture. Horrible!
1.0,"It arrived with stains ALL over the dress, it looked like someone had spilled some type of oil all over the bottom."
1.0,Great idea.. doesn't stay on my boot or shoe
1.0,I wore the bracelet once and it turned brown. I will not order from them again. Stainless steel is not suppose to turn.
1.0,I wear a 3x shirt and I purchased a 5x of this to wear over a shirt.....I could not even get in on.  my wife who wears a 2x  tried it on and she could even button it.....so I have say this brand is just chinese junk...and will return....
1.0,"This dress is very poorly made and cut in a way that it ends up coming down way too low on the v cut neck. My daughters whole chest is exposed and if you try to raise it up and tie the top tighter it bunches all the fabric and rides up into her arm pits. Do not buy, completely unwearable!"
1.0,"I bought these for my anatomy lab, and although they were a little pricier than most goggles, I felt that they were cute enough to be worth it. They broke within a week of me having them without even falling on the floor or anything. Other lab members had cute ones that were from a different brand and had no issues. Save your money and get a different brand."
1.0,The hardware was inferior; the logo was off; difficulty holding handles because there was very little space and I have small hands; it looked like junk from China.
1.0,Only padded on 1boob wtf

1.0,"I'm disappointed with this Purchase, I was under the impression that they were gonna say Love on them.  Ok yes I do see where it says Love . But I thought it was gonna Dark ink . To be able to read it better. I also ordered a Size 8 and they don't really fit good. Very tight . I normally wear a 7 Ring. If it's a size 8 it's a very Small 8 then.."
1.0,returned.<br /><br />the quality seems good though. and it should keep your arms warm. i can't say whether or not they will shrink when washed and dried. maybe hand wash them and lay to dry?
1.0,Hardware on laces broke
1.0,Very cheap material in the description it say Cotton blend and it is definitely 100% polyester.

1.0,Tarnished right away...waay too big
1.0,The button in the back was broke off.

1.0,These leggings are so thin and see through. I regret buying them.
1.0,Always a wrinkle on the ankle. No top heel.<br /> These are nothing more than a tube
1.0,The wire broke after wearing it once. I picked it up off the counter and beads went everywhere.  It couldn't be fixed. I had to throw it away.<br /><br />I was very disappointed because it was a pretty piece.  Just a total waste of money.
1.0,Earrings were nice but can't understand how to fasten them.
1.0,"This shirt is way too small, will return immediately"
1.0,Not assorted as posted<br />You will get 4xs 3xs of the same off colors nothing like they advertise.<br />I tried to return these also because the delivery took so much more than was stated when ordering and they make it impossible.<br />Must be shipping from China<br />I wouldn’t have purchased knowing this

1.0,"We even ordered this size larger and it’s just simply too tight, straps are so narrow  making it  uncomfortable"
1.0,I was too embarrassed to take a picture with the dress on. It looks NOTHING like the picture. It is sheer. It is cut differently. There are streaks of GOLD in the fabric. The fabric is this odd shiny fabric. It was so strange!! Nothing like the picture.
1.0,I used this set for the first time on a  7 day cruise and the wheels broke.  I am not pleased.
1.0,"honestly,  is  a waste  of  money the  cup  plastic  is like  a  bottle  plastic  soo  hard  and  run very  small  ..."

1.0,"I thought this dress was beautiful.  Today I out it on my duagrwr for the first time and within 2 hours all the flowers came off. She wasn't rough housing, picking at them or anything they just fell off!! What a waste of money and I'm so upset because I adore this dress"
1.0,Ordered my usual size but was too small. Otherwise seemed like a decent coat.
1.0,I have had these leggings less than a month. I love the fit and they are amazing but quality is HORRIBLE!!!! They are coming apart at the seams and I have only worn them maybe 4 times. HIGHLY disappointed.
1.0,It’s see through the whole thing very cheap material

1.0,"I needed bifocal readers, clear glass on top to see at distances clearly.  These are fuzzy from top to bottom...absolutely useless.  It you can see clearly at a distance, do NOT try these.  Waste of money."
1.0,"The purse is pretty but the strap broke as soon as I took it out of the box.  Also, it has a strange fishy smell."
1.0,"I am very sorry to say that the material of this blouse is of poor taste. Unfortunately, It looks cheap. It would be a good buy only for those without fashion sense :("
1.0,Does not actually fit the watch
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this POS
1.0,"They stretch and break easily. They're supposed to be made for kids, who pull and play with anything. The elastic stretches our and tears too easily"
1.0,This is not a crop jacket. This jacket fit me but it looked like i was wearing a child’s coat. IT looks like I borrow my niece jacket for the day. Horrible. Look and fit nothing like the picture. Returning ASAP!!!!

1.0,"Cheap material, zipper does not work and $275 to ship it back."
1.0,After few days the time had changed totally inaccurate. Built materials is crap. Not recommended to buy it even for one dollar
1.0,Cheap. I was forced to keep them bc I had a sock hop the day after they arrived. These glasses aren't even dollar store quality! I've actually gotten some nicer glasses at the dollar store.  No. These are more like something u would get at a party store that would come 10 in a pack for a couple of bucks. So dissatisfied. The nerve of this company.  They are really small as well.
1.0,Size runs small and mold pour or casting marks are rough on the toes.
1.0,Cute earrings comfortable small good price.  But 2 stones fell out of earrings 1 each earring in the same place
1.0,"I ordered this package for my child and when we opened the backpack, the backpack had a pack of birth control pills inside along with handwritten notes. Unacceptable! This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed."
1.0,"Worse Amazon purchase ever! The 'sports bra' is not a sports bra at all. This is just material attached to a blousey tank top. No support, no true design just awkwardly shaped piece of material."
1.0,It’s not the way it looks in the picture. The fabric is very flimsy and cheap. I wish I can return it. The tie is not attached to collar but goes all the way long that can be dangerous for kids if you are not paying attention. DON’T BUY IT.
1.0,Great packaging to make it look premium. The glasses themselves are really cheap. Based on the original price I thought these were more premium than they were.

1.0,How is anyone's groin supposed to fit in these pants?! I'm a woman and the groin is TOO SMALL for ME. I hate to imagine what it'd be like for a man.

1.0,I ordered a 2x for my son who is a 1x normally it looks like a child large. Order 2x bigger. The detail is very nice though
1.0,Poor quality...Highly disappointed
1.0,Ants in the package

1.0,Cheap looking. Do not order. The quality is not good at all. The bow is flimsy. I was very disappointed.  Order from the Vfemage vendor.
1.0,Legs to Short 👀😩
1.0,There is no possible way this is a Women's XL!  Fits more like a GIRLS' XL--and I mean a size 14-16 GIRLS!!
1.0,"I would love to tell you how warm this sweater is in chilly Maine fall mornings, and evenings. Well I can't do that because the shipping is deathly slow!!! Placed the order 15 days ago and nothing, no order update, or shipping info other than it left shipper facility. When searched on a usps website for tracking, the only information I get is label created.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money, cause you'll end up cold waiting for it!"
1.0,Disliked the color & I ordered the wrong size. Should have been a small.
1.0,I'm super upset that the stitching was done horribly. I cant believe they sent it that way as if they didnt notice.
1.0,"Good fit, zippers broke first day on both side pockets"
1.0,"I expected it to fit small - Probably true to size, but too large.<br />It looked cheap something a grandmother would wear.  I returned."
1.0,"Color is more of a dark rose, not even close to what is advertised."
1.0,My package came with the pouch but it was EMPTY. The rings wasn’t included at all.
1.0,"Its literally flannel pjs, and I'm dumb for not reading the reviews 🙃"
1.0,Cheap plastic jacket. Cut small for 3x.
1.0,"Rolex Datejust II 41mm --  the rubber strap fits with lug, but is not flush or even with face nor bezel.  Poor attention to detail / poorly made.  It seems this may be the difference between these and those of well known companies ( $150 to $200 )"
1.0,Thick as heck!! It’s like a face SHIELD! Not a mask. I haven’t used it but once.
1.0,"Cheap, broke<br />Within the first day, I had to<br />Trash while on vacation. An buy a new bag"

1.0,"The Yoga tank top fabric is cotton and spandex, it does not label the percentage of the blend.<br />The synthetic fabric spandex is non-biodegradable (eventually the process might take 20 to 200 years). Spandex fibers are derived from petroleum."
1.0,This is a crop top!
1.0,I was really disappointed with this sweater the buttons are different then pictured color was different and it was extremely small. I read the reviews and decided just to order a bigger size. My husband is a smaller build and can fit a medium comfortably. So I went with a large and it doesn't fit go figure. I think these are kid sizes which is fine but don't advertise for men if that's not the case. Waste of time and money I am in the process of returning and will not purchase from this seller again
1.0,I bought this to whear to nice places but before I could use it a single time I had to figure out that the dials don't do what they are supposed to. So you can't adjust the day of the month without spinning the minute hand hundreds of times. The timer feature doesn't work. You can't adjust the sun and moon dial at all. There is supposed to be two buttons on the side that you need a thin pointy object to access whatever they are for but they don't exist and the directions are written so badly that you can't understand them to figure the thing out.
1.0,We've had this for a few months now and it's already falling apart. The letters are coming off. We wash with like colors and fabrics and air dry. Disappointed.
1.0,Does not work
1.0,"I wear a Large, ordered a 2x, and they will be given to my daughter who wears a small."
1.0,"These are $50 from Nike and they deliver just as fast. Also, they look taupe in the picture but they are a light grey color. I made the mistake and overpaid on a pair just like them that still had the original price. Also, the elastic band rolls down. Don’t recommend buying Nike from Amazon sellers & don’t recommend elastic band design"
1.0,does not look very nice kind of cheep looking
1.0,"Looked pretty cheap, which I expected for the price-BUT the picture says quartz on the watch face and it doesn't in real life. It's a cheap knock off of the product in the picture. It wasn't working at first til I jiggled the battery. It worked about a week and died. Who needs a cheap watch that doesn't keep time. Invest in a watch, save money on something that doesn't need to work properly."
1.0,"Good mask for most, just not large enough to accommodate beards."
1.0,"I don't know where the sizing is coming from but these do not fit my ears. I've ordered quite a few gauges from KUBOOZ and the sizing seems to be a little off at times. I waited to long to exchange so now I'm stuck with gauges that don't fit. Sheesh, what a waste just wanted what I ordered........."
1.0,I wanted it to wear to church but it was to short. I returned it.
1.0,"Ill fitting, weird seams, sheer, poor quality material, not like the picture. I was not expecting much based on the price, but this was way below my already low expectations."
1.0,Made super cheap they dont look like the picture
1.0,"Well made, poorly designed. When I attached my cameras the back strap pulled up to rest the weight on my neck which is what I was trying to alleviate. No instructions either so I don't know if I'm even putting it on right. Will be returning on Monday...so sad I had high hopes."
1.0,"these are not low rise jeans and ever time i have a return with prime , I am able to have ups pick up right from my house. This was not a option with this order, will not order from here again"
1.0,Terrible - so awkward-looking and didn’t do anything flattering to my 34Cs
1.0,"Very small chain, choker size and definitely not Sterling silver.  Disappointed. Cheap quality, almost like dollar store."
1.0,"It was not what I was expecting.  Did not look anything like the picture.  And even though I ordered a size bigger, it still did not do what it said it would.  Waste of money.  To return, they wanted me to pay for the shipping.  So I got half back, and threw the item in the trash. Ok"
1.0,dislike- am returning it...does not stay on wrist
1.0,Was the worst pair of shorts i have ever bought do not buy
1.0,Sunglasses broke after being worn a few times
1.0,Got a large. After washing I could not get it over my head. Should have believed the reviews. Buyer beware!
1.0,Not at all what I thought I would receive from pictures and descriptions
1.0,Went to wear the outfit and the strap is not even sewn together. Can’t wear
1.0,The $28.00 price on the tags soured me on deal. $69.00  Tacky. It was a gift so I didn't return it but I wish now that I had.
1.0,Can’t set time right hard to work has an alarm that goes off at 12 a.m for no reason
1.0,"Recieved the earrings and the wings were facing the same direction instead of a left wing and right wing, I received two right wings. Beautiful earrings but that was dissapointing."
1.0,"The thickness of the material felt like tissue paper. I was not happy with this product. I guess you get what you paid for. Cheaper price, cheaper construction."
1.0,"Es lo más horrible que he comprado en mi vida en Amazon, está mal hecho , la tela es de mala calidad, caliente, es horrible el cuello horribleeeeeee<br />La estrella que tiene es por que sino no se agrega el comentario"
1.0,… I posted an HONEST review of this horrible dress.
1.0,Fit was bigger than expected and the material is thin.
1.0,The purse is very tiny the size for a Barbie doll
1.0,"I was happy at first with this watch, I wear it 4 times in a year. Only for specials ocasions,  until the band crack like it was a $3 watch . And it's no replacement for it. Bad quality.  I do not recommend this. They look awesome first.  Wait and you will see.<br />Post. Review.<br />After my bad experience with the band I'd been talking to a representative of the seller and I can tell his concern to solve this, so far great customer service. 2 watches same problem .<br /><br />i just found out a band that i can use . made for invicta not from<br />then . apparently they only made the watches not bands??"
1.0,Very displeased only had it for a few months and yesterday the stone fell off out of the setting.
1.0,"I should have listened to the several reviews saying you get bells when you order the tulip cups. I don't know what tulips the person who wrote the description has seen, but these are bells. Maybe a type of lily at best... but certainly not tulips. Returning these today and ordering something closer to what I thought I was buying."
1.0,I loved the color of the material. But it was see through and there was a giant hole in the hem when i recieved it. Didn't wear it out on my date and just sent it back.  Would not buy again.
1.0,"I am amazed at the high ratings this hat has garnered, as the one I received is a piece of junk.  Maybe it is just the red one.<br />  It appears to be thin, flocked cardboard, and the flocking did not cover the brown edge of the cardboard.  The picture clearly shows the cardboard that shows through on the edges - and it was the same all the way around.  Surprisingly, with the materials it seems to be made of, I could not shape it after steaming it, and I've been steaming and shaping hats for many years.<br />  I would have returned it, but I needed it for a special occasion two days after it arrived.  I was able to &#34;save&#34; the hat by using a red felt-tip pen to color the edge, but that shows if one was to look closely.<br />  Pros:  delivered quickly."
1.0,These are trash. Struggled to get them in. Once I was able to get them in I was able to go up a gauge size. Never used them after that.
1.0,I clean my band daily because I am very active. I now have to get a new band because of the rash it keeps giving me.
1.0,This isn't a product you should buy. The design is too tacky. The pack I bought had stains on it. It doesn't fit at all. The color isn't how it's pictured on the ad. I wish I can get a refund from it.
1.0,"I received this bracelet on October 13th.  A couple days ago, I noticed it was beginning to come apart where it is joined together.  Yesterday, the bracelet completely separated (see photo) at that seam.  Now I have a useless piece of junk for which I paid almost $200!!  (I am a 59-year-old woman and wore this bracelet only in the evening, AT HOME.  I do not play any type of sports, and did not sleep or shower with it on.)  Unfortunately, I did not keep the box it came in so I cannot return it.  Save your money and buy something more heavyweight and expensive.  Very disappointing."
1.0,The item was intended for a Christmas gift.  Neither myself or the recipient liked the material  It was like sandpaper.  I will be returning this item for credit.  BUT the purchasing service was great.
1.0,realllly want to return but for some reason cant
1.0,Not a good fit for me.
1.0,They are not sterling silver started turning green
1.0,description not at all accurate. returned 3 times and still none fit. these are children’s sizes.
1.0,The sleeves are super small compared to the body and the item was ripped at the seams
1.0,Wore it for 24 hours before the bottom part of the anchor broke off. Very upset. Loved this ring a lot.
1.0,"This is the first time I have written a review of any product purchased.  I hope that this review will save someone who is seeking to purchase a good watch from wasting their money.  I should have known there was a problem when I was attempting to set the date.  When I got to the number 31 the numbers kept going up to 39.  The directions that accompanied the watch did not have any information about setting the day and month, so the dials were as useless as the 2 buttons on the watch.<br /><br />Finally, to add insult to injury, the watch stopped working on the 4th day I wore it.<br /><br />Sandra"
1.0,"The dress was tight on my arms and extremely loose around my waist. Could just be my top heavy body shape, but it definitely was not for me."
1.0,It did not look good on. The fit was right I ordered a small I'm 5'6 about 130 with a B32 cup size. But it was just a no for me.
1.0,Not kids... more like toddler.
1.0,"It doesn't look like the picture. It wasn't oversize at all, it actually runs small. I ordered my normal size which is Large but the sleeve are short and it fits like a small to be a cardigan. I should have ordered 2xl if I wanted to get the look of the picture in the model. Im return it."
1.0,"This is not the dress pictured<br />It is basically a slip<br />It is not cut the same ,doesn't even have the line pattern in the dress. Looks nothing like advertised.<br />You should be ashamed scamming people's money"
1.0,"The NASA graphic is very poorly placed, right on the pleated part. I was very disappointed. Will be returning."
1.0,"This is one of my biggest amazon disappointments.  The material is so thin that the seams and zipper pucker.  I'm not sure this could keep anyone warm--it's not lined!! The image makes it look like it is lined, but only the hood and two tiny strips by the zipper are lined.  Oh, but there is an added bonus feature...for anyone who wants to hide her face, the zipper xcx goes all the way up through the hood!  I was just thinking the other day, ""Why can't I find a hoodie that I can zip completely shut--over my face?"""
1.0,I had to return it it was too large
1.0,Too short and too tight!
1.0,Right side boot more narrow than the left. Ordered larger side boot because most boots are too narrow and still have problems. Will buy different brand next time.
1.0,"The ""black"" wings are gray, they arrived totally misshapen from poor packaging, and they're just images of feathers printed onto flimsy material.<br /><br />Waste of time and money."
1.0,This was definitely not what I received. This is not a skinny/slim tie!
1.0,Wasn't able to give as gift because the feathers on dreamcatcher were missing on one earring
1.0,"My watch was a gift from my wife. It will not reset to daylight savings time, and the company will NOT honor the warranty.  Do not buy these unreliable watches."
1.0,does not keep correct time and is inferior quality  WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,Order at least two sizes up if you have a bust!
1.0,Ordered a 3x but when it arrived it was way too small....so disappointed!!!!
1.0,The sleeves hung right around my elbows - not quite long short sleeves and not quite 3/4 length sleeves. Shorts were WAY too small.
1.0,Didn't fit my eye pads. Very disappointed. Needs better description what they fit and don't fit.
1.0,"Only thing is they were super long. No where in the description did they say long. Waist fit ok , just we’re so long."
1.0,"I ordered an XL, the seller sent a small. Strong chemical smell, product made in China. Sent back, will purchase one elsewhere."
1.0,Lately the items I have bought from this seller are bad quality. I have bought from them in the past and fell in love with the clothes but not anymore. This bodysuit like another I recently bought was frayed and made for a small child.
1.0,"Absolutely huge, makes them look awkward. Super bummed."
1.0,"the label seal on the plastic bag says size &lt;small > which is I ordered, but the label on the skirt says &lt;XS>.<br />It is wrong size and bad work for online business."
1.0,Sizing is way off
1.0,waste of money<br />did not melt properly and could not get it to stay
1.0,Never ordered this
1.0,"This bag was complete crap. I took it on one trip because it fits Spirit Airlines free carry on requirements. That was all that was good about it. On the trip through the airport on my way there the loop for the shoulder strap started to rip. So I stopped carrying it by the shoulder strap, even though it was much more comfortable to carry it that way.<br /><br />On the return trip home, the zipper came completely off shortly before getting on the plane. So, I had to travel the rest of the way home with a wide open bag with no shoulder strap. It's horrible and a complete waste of money. It didn't even last one trip."
1.0,"I've always wanted a pair of diamond studs, so I ordered these. I wore them for 3 days and then I noticed one of the stones had fallen out onto my couch. They were very pretty until this happened."
1.0,Poor quality; it wrinkles easily and looks cheap.
1.0,One sleeve was bigger then the other and looks nothing like it does in the picture. I was so sad!
1.0,this are too small my 4 year old could wear it but not me!
1.0,I ordered a women's large and the set looks more like a child large. Extremely disappointed
1.0,This is not a two piece!  It is a one piece.  The straps are defective only having 1 hook on one side and the size is way off.  What a disappointment!!!
1.0,"These things are not ""waterproof"" anymore than putting a plastic bag over your hand wrapped with cloth. The outer layer is not waterproof at all and so water will soak through  go inside of it and now, although your hand wont be directly wet, your hand now will be sitting inside of a pool of cold water surrounding it. Also, I went on a short walk at 40 degrees, they were completely dry and in only 10 mins I could already feel the cold coming through to my fingers and a lot of cold coming through on the ouside knuckle of my thumbs. They look ""pretty"" and the packaging was nice, but if you want gloves that actually do something useful, this is an epic fail."
1.0,The WORST camel toe
1.0,XXL is more like a US Large . Very Small
1.0,"This sweater is super short, like its crop top, but not long enough for it to be cute, just go to F21 and buy a sweater from there."
1.0,Item received is missing the part that the keys are to go on!!!
1.0,Sweater very small even though i made sure to order up two sizes. Material cheap not soft like stated. Returning it.
1.0,"I received this dress and it fit well, but there was a fatal flaw. The bottom of the dress is sheer, so they added a sewn-in slip, which would usually be great, but this slip was way too short and did not cover my butt. You can clearly see the slip (and my butt) through the dress. It’s just poorly made and not worth the money."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this set but it had many odd fit problems. The lower sleeves were MASSIVE, it looked like a pajama top. The skirt wouldnt button and it went almost to my ankles. Ordered a size 12, height 5'3, weight 205 and I carry most of it in my hips, butt, and thighs; in proportion I have a pretty small waist. The quality of the fabric was great but the fit was awful. Returning."
1.0,Get what you paid.
1.0,"I used to buy these at our local Target as I’ve worn them for years. I no longer shop at Target so I bought them from Amazon. I bought 1 package instead of 3 or 4 like I usually do to make sure they were the same. They are TERRIBLE!! DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I have always loved them however they are made extremely cheaply now. They don’t come true to size. They are smaller. There is almost NO elastic in the waistband to hold them up. I constantly have to pull them up during the day. At night if I even roll over in bed, they slide all the way down. I’m so glad I only wasted my money on 1 package. They have seriously deteriorated in quality. They have obviously drastically decreased how much money/labor they put into making them. NOT again Hanes, not from me."
1.0,Much larger than expected. The ball doesn’t stay on very well.. big waste of money
1.0,"Most importantly, the material is quite terrible; it's heavy and shiny in a strange way. The top, ruched part is too small, the seams are much too tight for an XX-L and the skirt fits badly, which doesn't normally happen for me. For reference I'm 5'5&#34;, 200.  I'd highly recommend buying a different product."
1.0,Extremely sheer. It was see through. I looked like a colonial woman in this.... the model shows it very well.... not in my case though. Upsetting.
1.0,These are very cute but can't hold a purse that weighed only 4 lbs.  I had a small purse and hung it up at the nail salon and they each snapped under the weight of a tiny handbag.  I was very disappointed and had to place my handbag on the dust covered table.
1.0,Mask was huge.  Material was thin and cheap and appeared dirty.  Save your money.  Would not recommend.
1.0,Arrived ripped at seam where elastic is inserted.
1.0,Horrible broke as I was putting it on!!!!!! Want a refund!
1.0,I'm going to buy the glasses I saw at the store.
1.0,broke the first day :(
1.0,"The size is nice, because I have small wrists; but the bracelet is of poor quality and looks cheap. The initial charm hangs awkwardly and you can barely see it, unless up close."
1.0,I got same designs
1.0,Warning.. This pantsuit is okay.. But the stripes do not look like as shown. It looks more like an inmate jumpsuit.
1.0,Bought for Christmas straps are breaking in march
1.0,"Definitely not cotton.  Uncomfortable against skin, something very artificial."
1.0,Runs small. Cheap quality
1.0,Did not worked and have to rerun
1.0,Bought these for my husband. These are too small and not soft at all! They are a very scratchy cotton. Why would anyone want scratchy pajama pants? Returning.
1.0,I bought 2 packs of these for my girls. Dont waste your money. These dont stick very well. Fall off very quickly. I even tried rubbing alcohol on the ears first.
1.0,"I usually order large but ordered extra large and it is so small. I am going to give to young niece,<br />First time this has happened with Amazon,"
1.0,"These are very poor quality and the seller charges entirely too much for a restocking fee. If you are going to buy these, I would choose a different seller."
1.0,No le gusto a mi Esposo. No tiene calidad
1.0,The shoulder room in this coat is non-existent. I don’t have wide shoulders at all and couldn’t put my arms down when I tried this on. It also looks more like the hideous dress robes Ron got versus Tonks steampunk jacket.
1.0,Cheap products
1.0,Ummmm a lens is missing.... Really???
1.0,I can't even hook this bra.  Runs really small will be returning this item
1.0,These are so brittle and cheap that they literally fell apart after wearing for an hour.  Would like a refund.
1.0,"So sorry to say, in general I'm not a fan of polyester. But this dress is ultra polyester and looks cheap.  The sizing  is very small. Disappointing! I tried to return it but missed the return day by 2 days🙁"
1.0,"These are the worst quality flojos, they must be knock offs. We opened the box and took out the bag and noticed the sole has separated on the front of both flip flops. Very poor quality for the price paid."
1.0,Very bad quality.<br />I have not used ever<br />Does not look clean
1.0,Very poor quality as soon as I put it on to try it on I kept the hitch in my hand
1.0,"The XL was too big, but this was too short.  I was surprised by the huge size difference.  Also, it had aa 8&#34; line running from the middle of the neckline straight down.  The line looked to be made from some heat source (iron?) where the fabric had a definite sheen that the rest of the fabric didn't have.  Therefore...I can't wear it."
1.0,La tela es caliente.
1.0,The material cheap
1.0,These parts were so thin and so small I sent it back right away.
1.0,Super thin and see thru. A size too small.
1.0,Huge and totally visible.  In fact it is all you can see.  Waste of money.
1.0,One Star Recommendation
1.0,Was supposed to be stainless steel and was just nickle plated it was terrible. Turned my skin green and broke if 2 days.
1.0,"Highly dissatisfied with this purchase. This item never worked - it did not light up. I attempted to return and found that I would need to pay my own shipping costs to return. Because of the strange size of this item - the return shipping is about $15 - half of the item price, so I will lose $15 on an item that never worked, best case scenario. I contacted the seller and was told that there was nothing they could do to help me as Amazon sets their return policy."
1.0,"I ordered an M, it was way too big, so had to give it away to someone who wears 2XL-3XL."
1.0,It arrived with a ripped seam - I had to sew it because I didn't have time before the event to wait for it to ship back and receive a replacement. Was not my best amazon experience
1.0,This was a waste of money. Looks nothing like the picture. The material this & see through. I'm straight disappointed!
1.0,"Didn’t last one day, it broke right away. This purchase was a waste of money."
1.0,Poorly made...
1.0,"Hugs in the wrong places, frumpy looking, not flattering, material is cheap and hot."
1.0,I wasn’t a fan of the padding in these shorts. It just felt weird and wasn’t comfortable at all. Decided to buy a more comfortable seat and that works so much better.
1.0,It's cut really wide
1.0,I wasn't pleased with it at all
1.0,Didn’t like the material. Definitely not for shorter people who are bigger in size. It’s extremely long.
1.0,It rolls down in the back and digs into your skin very uncomfortable not worth the money.
1.0,Horrible expirience!
1.0,The product appeared to be of good quality stitched lettering but the letters were glued on and after one wear and wash started to significantly peel and is no longer appropriate for wear. It was a waste of money.
1.0,Way to small does not fit according to measurements.
1.0,The earrings arrived on time but they had both ear piece bent. It can be straightened but hard to put in the ears.<br /><br />I dont know what to do. 😡😡😡
1.0,Not too good as pictures<br />It’s for $25 I think that is real price for it<br />I return it and didn’t get return money for it<br />1 month already!!!
1.0,These glasses are bifocals not progressive multifocals
1.0,The cups are way too small. I will return if I can.
1.0,I did not care for this fabric.  Not a good feel.
1.0,I bought these for me and my 2 daughters. ON the FIRST day the string started falling apart!!!! y daughter ended up taking it off because it was coming apart so easily! DON'T BUY!!!!!
1.0,These took longer to get them than they lasted.  I waited weeks for them to arrive and after 2 days one of them stopped working.
1.0,"I bought this watch in September 2020. It began losing time this week and today, October 7, it stopped working completely. Poor quality. Is not worth the money i paid for it."
1.0,Cheap material doesn’t look good
1.0,I ordered a small and it is way too large!
1.0,Chain broke 2nd day
1.0,"I ordered this band when my original Gear Fit 2 Band broke. I was really happy with it initially, it was much sturdier than my original band and I really liked the texture. Unfortunately, the small round metal piece that serves as the &#34;connector&#34; for the watch irritates my skin A LOT. Would be a great watch band if I wasn't allergic to it."
1.0,"Ordered a medium, got a large in a questionable package with a cover depicting a man and woman both wearing a single pair at the same time (????). Even being a size larger than I needed, this outlines my unmentionables way too much with the fabric being thin with no real support. Not worth the trouble of returning it."
1.0,Fabric quality is very poor!! Is almost see threw don’t buy it!!
1.0,Waffle house employee here. The print is awesome but the sleeve itself is waaaaaay too big.
1.0,"Yikes. I am not a fan of these face bandannas. They are extremely cheaply made, and they appear to be made from  similar fabric as basketball shorts with ""netting"" or mesh material. Sure, it's ""breathable"" but there is no way this is actually going to filter out anything at all. There were also (unintentional) holes along the back stitching, and a few threads that stuck out without any good reason. These are also way too large to actually fit around the face, under the eyes and over the nose, and sink down to the neck with no obvious way to keep them upright. This is a big miss for me."
1.0,"This bracelet looks great. Stylish. When I got it I was very happy with it. A week later, not so happy. It fell apart. No joke! The string holding the metal part to the leather unraveled and fell apart. A bracelet that only last a week is not too good. Cheaply made. Will not last if you wear it. Poor quality."
1.0,"Están muy lindos, pero son muy incómodos, donde se juntan dos materiales solo tiene un pequeño listón en lugar de forro y calan mucho"
1.0,Very poorly made. Would not click to stay closed. Returned for refund.
1.0,DO not purchase...Returned...as you can see the pattern is only printed on one side and there is writing on the other.
1.0,It’s good but it’s very fragile
1.0,Way too small<br />Cheap fabric<br />Will be returning
1.0,Broke. One of the earrings was broken off at the base of the post on arrival.
1.0,Would not recommend. They are so small and hard to put on
1.0,"These earrings are super cute, however when they arrived, one of the stars was broken and there is no way to re-attach because they are connected to the chain by means of soldering. I didn't expect them to be good quality because the price was so low, but I did expect to receive undamaged earrings."
1.0,"Blatant rip off. It's a shirt, but not a sweatshirt. Lightweight cheap material. Colors not accurately depicted. Just don't buy it."
1.0,The fit is for a teenager.
1.0,This so in no way a 3x. I wear a 2x in tops and a 1x in bottoms. This couldn't even pass my thighs. I went up in size because I knew that I would be gaining weight. I would say this would fit someone that normally wears a medium to large and that may still be a snug fit. These are not American sizes. It would not have covered my boobs. I'm tall and the torso is very short on this.
1.0,Aun no yega o talves no yegue
1.0,I am a 42 D and I thought if I got it bigger that the top would be bigger also. Boy was I wrong I was literally spilling out no matter how I positioned it.
1.0,"this dress comes in not the color in picture and they will not even let you return this item, even though it looks nothing like the pictures. PLEASE do not buy."
1.0,Very cute earrings. But the long post snaps off from the main earring way too easily. Went through two pairs in less than a month and now I can’t return the latest ones that just broke.
1.0,Neck line is too small. I buy 2XL.
1.0,SUPER small!!!! And the color is more of a yellow. Don't waste your money on this shirt.
1.0,I am very disappointed in this purchase. They arrived today dirty and I am unsure how/or if they can be cleaned.
1.0,way to small and i have tiny hands
1.0,"The garment was of inferior fabric and workmanship. Typically, I give things away that I can not use OR throw them away. This item will need to be discarded."
1.0,That’s garbage 🥺
1.0,"So, I didn't buy this expecting high quality designer product. However, I did expect a dress. But the fabric reminds me of a tent/tarp, and the sowing is bad quality as out of the package the pockets had holes in them. Would not recommend for my worst enemy, as a dress with pockets is girls best friend. This dress was a major let down."
1.0,Wish they had them in a size bigger .<br />I normally wear between a medium and large I ordered the large and they are too small .<br />Other than the sizing they are really nice shorts.
1.0,"The picture is deceiving. When I received this, it was in 5-pieces. Many of the &#34;stones&#34; were laying in the bottom of the package and SEVERAL were glued on hap-hazardly. The picture shows a beautiful, colorful necklace. Don't buy it, it's terrible quality ! !!!!"
1.0,Really crappy material.
1.0,Cheap quality. Faded material. No stretch or give at all even at the elastic wasteband. Purchase two sizes larger if you want to enjoy these pjs even a little bit.
1.0,"Not worth the money, effort, etc."
1.0,"The product is very clumsy, the frame shape is very good but it needs some weight for it to be hold properly, not worth the money"
1.0,The upper part too tight.
1.0,The bags break after about 3 uses. Do not buy.
1.0,Product right sleeve seam ripped as soon as I put my arm in it on the right side. Very poorly made.
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!!<br />not worth the money at all its tiny like hancercief tiny not big enough to be a scarf and the patern looks nothing like the pic. im serious do not buy not worth a penny!!!
1.0,"Super cheap clasp, only got to wear it once."
1.0,If I could give it 0 stars I would. So small (looks bigger in photo) which isn’t the bad part. the inside bag that has the pineapple leaf part is way too small for the black part which makes it look so weird. So hard to tell it’s a pineapple. needs to be more structured and actually fit into the black part of the bag
1.0,My regular size was too small. The larger size won't stay up. I kept the larger ones anyway. I'll wear them around the house. They also have a chemical odor that I'm still washing out. Not for me.
1.0,"I normally wear a 36D, after reading the reviews, I bought a 36 DD... It's very tight, I managed to put it on but I had muffin tops. Thought I would just put an extender on it but when I went to take it off.... The band is Backwards. I had to pull it back around just to undo it... Gonna keep it because I'm not paying for UPS to pick it up. And I don't have time to find a drop box... Plus, getting the next size up won't solve the backwards band."
1.0,These leggings were completely see through.
1.0,"Very cheaply made and runs small, as soon I I tried it on the strap broke."
1.0,"I ordered my size. I'm very slim. 16 1/2 neck 36-37 sleeve. The only thing that was right was the length on the sleeve. I couldn't ever button this shirt it was so tight. Also this shirt is way thin that you can see your skin through it. I hate to give bad reviews, but it's a s***ty quality shirt and not true to size."
1.0,"These are a joke. Worst bra I Ever tried to get on. Cup to little, strap that goes around is to tight but the one that hooks in front is to big"
1.0,"This wrap was not at all what I expected, and did not do what it was supposed to do. Instead of flattening my tummy, it left my stomach bulging out in the middle. Complete waist of money!!"
1.0,"Did not use, looks cheap & poorly made"
1.0,Didn’t care for the feel of the fabric and colors were ugly
1.0,I dont like that I was decived
1.0,Not what I expected. Not a “wet” look as described. Fit too snug. Did refund money.
1.0,"The whole purpose of purchasing these were to provide easier mask breathing, ease of use, & more importantly aid in prohibiting the constant fogging up of eyeglasses. This product did nothing as advertised. The plastic cut into the skin, the placement on the straps caused it to be ill-fitting on an average adult’s face, & my eyeglasses were fogging up more with it than without. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Was excited to get this to wear for the holidays. But it's a silky material. That is too thin and flimsy. Does not stay up In place. Plus two thin to be any protection.<br />Waste of money
1.0,We had the poor to use it before our vacation and unfortunately it broke at first use very disappointed
1.0,Different than what I expected.
1.0,Product arrived damaged. Returned
1.0,They do not filter and the straps are to long but the front is to small. Does not stay on face.
1.0,"These dont hang correctly. They are cotton, not silk cord, so they look like a clump of blue snot just hanging off my ears."
1.0,Photo is silver item arrived twice in yellow color. Fail.
1.0,Way too small for an adult male.
1.0,I laughed when I got this. Doesnt look like that!
1.0,"Not happy with this product, more like a slip than a dress. I would have sent it back, but have been sick over two months."
1.0,They were really nice. But I must have really small ears because they stuck out over the sides of my ears and the clasp didn't help of course. I ended up giving them to a friend.
1.0,Cheap I'll fitting dress. Don't buy it!
1.0,I ordered this ring because it seemed to be durable. I had it one month and it's already missing a stone. Now that it's been 7months it's missing 2 stones. Would not recommend it.
1.0,"I have natural curly hair. I had to return this product because the stitching that gives it its shape in the back (elastic), is exposed resulting in my hair being snagged. Inside the scarf, the elastic is exposed, it’s meant  to allow for stretching for different hairstyles, but I had planned to use  it as a sleeping bonnet. This works best for a casual day style."
1.0,"Would give 0 if could. Clasp will not work, would send back ups but someone has to be at home(work next 6 days) and closest ups drop off is 20 min. away ( live in boondocks). Beware"
1.0,THIS VEST DOES NOT HAVE ANY HEAT ON THE FRONT OF IT.  THE PICTURE THEY SHOW IS FALSE UNLESS I HAVE A DEFECTIVE ONE.  THE VEST ISNT THAT BAD BUT I NEED HEAT IN THE FRONT.  I HAVE EMAILED ADVENTURE OUTFITTERS 3 TIMES NOW IN THE PAST WEEK AND STILL NO RESPONSE.  I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT SINCE ITS STILL UNDER 30 DAYS.  I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!
1.0,"Product has an incredibly strong, unpleasant perfumed scent that made me ill.  Had to return"
1.0,"As you can see in the pic I attached, the requested color is NOT the same for the 2nd time. I requested the camel color, but received a blk one twice. This is beyond ridiculous that this is monitored more carefully. I needed and want that particular color hat for a reason. I had to end up purchasing a whole different hat from a more reliable seller. Thank God someone wants this WRONG color hat for me for the 2nd time, bc it was certainly a worst of my time and money."
1.0,very poorly made
1.0,"Could be bi-leather, but a very poor quality. Has an odd smell, I wouldn't pay $5 for it. Of course I sent it back."
1.0,Cute dress but way too small for size marked.
1.0,"It looked good on but after I received it, I washed it on gentle cycle before wearing it once! The backstraps became a tangled mess and totally unmanageable. Horrible design. I can't even get one use out of it. I would send it back for a refund but don't have the packaging any longer."
1.0,Way tooo skinny.... bought my regular size and it wasnt even close...
1.0,It's not at all what was pictured. The back of the gloves are mesh and are not heat resistant. I work as a weld robot operator and these gloves were a waste of my money and time waiting for them. They are a piece of crap. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these.
1.0,"I wear L / XL, comfortably … I bought this in a XXL and I can’t get it over my hips. It’s nowhere near an L, let alone XXL as the tag indicates... unless this is supposed to be children sizes. The (torn half tag) says XXL, I don’t know how narrow a person’s hips would have to be to fit these over them. The legs are definitely like a skirt but, the waist is a more like SM to MED with a couple of inches of elastic, if you squeeze. So disappointed."
1.0,"this fit like yo top.....i purchase a size up and i am 145 pounds , 5ft 9inches. not only the sleeves are nothing like whats in the pic, it was a little thing that barely covered my arms."
1.0,This is the second ChainsPro I bought within 6 months and it is much smaller than the first one. I guess I should have ordered the 3mm.
1.0,"MUCH smaller than described in description. The measurements on picture are very wrong. I would return it, but would not be able to order a different purse in time for my trip. Very disappointed"
1.0,"Package is complete different then what shown, was going to give to a friend with the amazing words inside the packet..."
1.0,Not worth to spend even 5 dollar for this product.<br />Very cheap quality
1.0,"The socks in the photo do not say Hallmark, but the ones I received say “I’m watching Hallmark Christmas Movies” which is not what was advertised or what I wanted. Very disappointed."
1.0,We didn't get all the accessories and the colors are different. Also it was ripped along the vest and the shirt
1.0,"Bottoms are the correct sizing, top is way to small!! Save yourself the trouble, it’s going back !!"
1.0,My kid wore it for a few days and one after the other it broke.
1.0,Don't buy !!!!
1.0,The fit on this terrible.  The middle part hangs weird. Returning
1.0,"the product has factory defects, poor finish, and does not match the advertisement."
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  This is not even close to being oversized, unless you're a Barbie doll.  While it says it is spandex and cotton, I'm quite sure I've never had anything cotton smell like a chemical site before.  This top is horrible."
1.0,"They look cute, but very disappointed,  one of the earrings was put together backwards. Sad, won't buy again."
1.0,The shirt was full of mold that didn’t go after washing<br />The threads were loose in the embroidery<br />The size does not match the chart available
1.0,Sized up two sizes and it's still about 3 sizes to small. Dont buy this. It's not worth the money.
1.0,"The earrings came with the posts flattened against the earring (assuming this was to avoid puncturing the bag they came in). When I tried to straighten post to wear them, the posts easily broke off."
1.0,"This onsie is just awful. The photo makes it look like a very cute outfit but upon receiving you will realize that you get what you pay for. Due to the low price i don't feel quite like i got ripped off but even then i will never buy from this seller again. The onsie is a very cheap print and the material is extremely thin and cheap. not worth purchasing!!! Also, the size is VERY small.... the jean look fits more like my child is wearing jean shorts. Not a good product at all!"
1.0,"The design of the buckles seems innovative and practical. And while they feel solid in construction  there is a small retaining pin inside that holds the locking mechanism in place. I have worn two of the belts fewer than five times each, and that pin has fallen out of both. That has rendered the buckles worthless. I am left with two sturdy straps."
1.0,The color is way lighter than the picture
1.0,"I'm very familiar with progressive lens glasses and know that they can take some getting used to. No getting used to these, though. If I turn my head just right, the reading view works. The mid is just a blur that gets more distorted as I move to distance. These are cheap and a waste of money. A note in the case assured me that I would receive a free pair if I posted a five star review. No thanks…they can’t give these away as far as I’m concerned."
1.0,I got to wear these pants 1 time. After I washed them they shrunk and a huge hole(6 inches) form in the seam on the bum.
1.0,Magnets are not strong enough and earrings fall off.
1.0,"i got something completely different. If you look at the related items you'll see a plain metal horde logo keychain, thats what i received. Its not even great quality. not nearly worth the $13 it cost me. and now i have to waste money and time to return it."
1.0,The cold shoulder openings did not have a finished edge. Almost like they were just cut open. Not happy with this at all
1.0,This is most definitely not a dress… it’s more like a fitted t. And it looks nothing like the pic at all. Disappointed in this for sure.
1.0,way too large..def not a one size fits all
1.0,One didn’t stay connected and other literally crumbled apart in my hand when I went to put in..
1.0,"I specifically ordered this belt because of the wider width. I didn't want a skinny belt. It's not 1-1/8&#34; wide. It's only 3/4&#34; wide and the buckle is totally different, too. See picture for what I received versus what I ordered. Not happy at all."
1.0,Would not purchase!  No support in the boob area.  Nothing.  I don’t have big cans but this looked horrible on me!  Threw it out.
1.0,So disappointed and this I am a professional fisherman and I thought it would be the perfect sailor's outfit for me to wear I'm 5 7 and 1/2 and 117 and 1/2 pounds it shows a red ruffle around the dress it's not there as well as the Hat is meant to fit a toddler my suggestion is not to buy this costume a waste of my money
1.0,The chain has broken and it's been about a month since I purchased
1.0,"Fits. However, (1) the fan in the suit arrived broken -- it does not emit enough air to inflate the suit, and (2) the suit arrived in plastic packaging that contained none of the identifying cardboard packaging. My guess is that the broken suit was returned to whomever and, instead of fixing it or throwing it away, it was simply reshipped -- minus the cardboard that the previous recipient or someone had discarded -- and sent to me. I am returning it today."
1.0,Pretty fabric but not secured shut. Felt like a shawl.
1.0,Fits way smaller than expected.
1.0,"Too big and the holes/mesh look go all the way to the crotch. Just not an overall good look. Unfortunately, you have to pay to send them back so im going to donate them instead. I would not recommend."
1.0,Not at all what is pictured
1.0,Too small and even went up a size.
1.0,Hat came folded in half. Vest was 2 sizes too small and bandana 2 sizes too big.
1.0,Love the colors but cheap material.
1.0,Tiny. Not at all as pictured.
1.0,Seriously broke when I tried it on. Didnt have it longer than 2 seconds. Lol. Soooo all I know about it is it broke.
1.0,"A sun bleached crease, flimsy ultra thin and wrinkled and creased “felt”—more like a dryer sheet<br />Only good part was the stuck on leaves and mushrooms which I repurposed<br />Don’t buy unless you want to waste money<br />And no returns accepted, no wonder…"
1.0,"These made for extremely high waisted individuals. Like most men, I have a low waistline; thus, they did not work for me."
1.0,"Extremely low quality, even by the standards of the country it was made in. The threads are falling apart right out of the box. Please see close-up pictures."
1.0,"One would think that steel cables would last more than one day.  This bracelet was very nice to look at, but can't be worn due to poor quality."
1.0,"Dress is way too big and has a split up the front all the way to your belly button. will have to wear something under this. the fabric is super heavy and very very polyester, almost swim suit fabric. I wanted a light summer dress. This is not it. You will sweat and stink in this fabric if you wear this in the summer."
1.0,"Cute dress but the pockets made the waist stick out and I looked pregnant. I’m 5’4” and 119 lbs, curvy, and the small fit but not at the waist."
1.0,picture is not what I recieved
1.0,I ordered gray it is ugly purplesh
1.0,"I thought these would be slightly smaller than other similar styles but I was wrong.  These are definitely on the bigger side of aviator styles.  The bottom of the rims are significantly diagonal, so much so that they look weird on my face.  They may work for some face shapes but definitely not mine. The mirrored finish is also a straight silver, which contrasts negatively with the gold frame; I had been hoping it would be gold tint mirrored.  They felt sturdy enough get my money out of them but I'll be returning them because I dislike the style so much."
1.0,Ugly as sin. Looks more like a potato sack than what the picture shows. Returning immediately.
1.0,Too brittle to be a nose ring. I put it in my cartilage worked okay. Flimsy and easy to break.
1.0,Was supposed to have crop top with it and didn't. Only yoga pants.
1.0,Disappointing. Ordered 5/6. Ran quite small more like a 4. Not good quality for the price. Returned it.
1.0,"We ordered a M and a L would have been better. It runs very small. 36C bust and too tight. bottoms were tight not loose fitting as shown on pic. Daughter disappointed, she like the fabric."
1.0,way to big returned item
1.0,Awful....it rides up. Wayyyyyyy up ladies. Watch out.
1.0,One shoe stopped working.
1.0,The worst.  They look good however they always loosening up and the end strings are too long gets caught on everything. Way to go Canada
1.0,Would have been a nice item IF it stayed closed. The latch was very cheaply made and would not stay closed at all. Not a good watch band at all and super risky to use with a high valued item like the Apple Watch.
1.0,"Snags clothes, magnet fell off. Would not purchase again!"
1.0,not what i was hoping for. very cheap looking
1.0,"Watch was too big, uncomfortable, even came in already damaged when I bought this product new. Just buy a different watch this one is not worth it."
1.0,Doesn’t look as nice as the picture looks like someone squashed it haven’t even worn it!  Looks like it came out of gum ball machine
1.0,Geez... it was too good to be true. Originally bought a medium and it was way too small. Then I wore the large out and it tore so easily on the side like the seem cane undone.
1.0,the orange coloring was very odd. it was a very light light color and almost neon. not tangerine at all.
1.0,The cover up fit perfectly.  Then I washed it once and it shrunk up to the size a small shirt.
1.0,I ordered this thinking it would be shiny and clean looking like the pictures however it came looking tarnished and no sparkles to the fake diamonds. It just looked used to me. I would definitely recommend moving on unfortunately.
1.0,Both broke 1st time I wore them!! Very disappointed!!
1.0,"I like the Tyr anti fog but the price is ridiculous.  Do you realize this is for .5 of an ounce making it one of the most expensive purchases per ounce you will make.  At least with the Speedo anti fog cleaner even though it is expensive  you get 2.5 ounces and it works as well.  I thought when I ordered this it was for 1.1 ounces, my screw up for not making sure as there was no description as to the amount of cleaner.  Some places even sell this for a higher price.  Don't shop Dicks sporting good they want $11.99, unbelievable."
1.0,"I sized up but if I didn’t, there’s no way my chest area would be fully covered. The shirt rips easily from pulling it around.  Super see through and goes up if you lift your arms up.  Don’t recommend. My measurements are correct."
1.0,Bad fit...  just a poor made and fitting shoe.  Can't believe they are trying to sell these
1.0,Poor quality<br />You can buy the same thing in target for 15$.
1.0,"Dislike, Size and quality"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d31283221f0741451c1d0babd358303c]] Cheap materials
1.0,Ring begins to turn.  I wore it about two weeks.  Not happy with it.
1.0,I need to return this product.. Horrible
1.0,"The sole began flaking and pealing after only two weeks. The straps snapped away from the sole before the summer was over.<br />They're very cute, and my daughter loves them, but they just don't function as shoes."
1.0,Not a short as labeled.
1.0,Really cute. Sizing was way off. More a small 6-8 than a large 10 - 12. Unfortunate!
1.0,So so sad!! I ordered a 3x so it would be BIG to tie on the side and it’s soo small!! So disappointed!!
1.0,Not the quality as shown in the pic
1.0,order xlarge and it run small
1.0,It didn't hang off shoulder and too smaĺl
1.0,"What I got was not even close to being matte, just regular cheap shiny black sunglasses, very dissapointing"
1.0,Lifted once phone placed into case. Then when I tried to fix it back on correctly - it cracked a little. Thus causing the glue to no longer hold the protector onto the phone.
1.0,If you have big boobs... Forget about it.... Tiny droopy boob holders... Bla
1.0,"My size is small, but its small size was very loose for me. I returned that and ordered XS, and it was again loose. So, I returned that again and forgot about this product. (Also it was very open from two sides, that everything was transparent.)"
1.0,"Didn’t even bother trying them on although they did appear true to size.  Quality of product was so cheap, material feels like paper. We will be returning."
1.0,Totally different from the picture. Different pattern. I will probably keep it since it might be a struggle to returning it at this time. Too bad.
1.0,not what I was expecting! too small and very see through!
1.0,Disappointed. Does not look like the picture. Extremely small and does not have a long peak. Fits like a child's hat.
1.0,The material was very cheap. Like tshirt material. I expected this dress to be more like the material of a business suit or something.
1.0,If i had known it was made in china ...i would have pased. It's too small to fit my wrist.
1.0,"I bought this as a Christmas Gift. I just found out the first time it was worn, the stem to change the fime fell off and was lost. This watch is basicly usless now unless you put it on the exact time it has stopped to get it working again. So very sad. It is a beautiful watch."
1.0,Came with a hole in the back and smelt of strong chemicals. Really bummed.
1.0,"Chain is not as thin as it looks in the picture. Way to thick, very cheap. Never worn👎🏾"
1.0,Sewing fell apart after one wear. No wash included.
1.0,I didn't like it but i don't have time to wait on another one it was a gift so i'm just going to deal with it bu i hope my dress is right 2x maxi black
1.0,Very cheaply made.  One broke just getting it out of the packaging.
1.0,The material was cheap and it looked terrible on. The picture is not a honest depiction of this dress!
1.0,"Pajamas are not flannel. They are polyester, not cotton flannel.  Pilling after first wash. Very disappointed in quality.  Definitely not worth $40.00!"
1.0,The material felt like plastic and had a strong stench. I had to wash several times and the smell went away temporarily. I previously purchased this same jacket in another color which I wear often and that one is made a a totally different material and had no smell. I just threw this jacket in the trash.
1.0,it is overpriced and cheaply made. it broke within 5min of putting it on. possibly the worst money ive spent on an Amazon product yet.
1.0,"Very dissatisfied with the shorts. At first loved the look, nice and  light weight. Then after a month or so snap buttons fallen off, stitching for especially rear pockets fallen out. Loved the look of shorts when I first bought them purchased every color. Big mistake. Not a fluke, all the shorts I bought stitching did not hold!!!! The real problem was when I put my wallet in my rear pocket not realizing the stitching was gone on a pair of shorts less than a month old. Not only my wallet was lost with at least  two hundred dollars, the worst was the driver's license, credit card etc. Shame on you to have poor workmanship just to save a few cents. I'm a 60 year old man and never had the stitching in the rear pocket fall apart let alone all the shorts I paid over 30 dollars for!!! Especially a pair of shorts less than a month old!!!! Screw You!!!!!"
1.0,The polarization is weak and definitely not HD. Do not buy.
1.0,"A gift for a client, it is apparently too small"
1.0,"They are not sterling silver,I want my money  back..They are tarnished real bad."
1.0,So disappointed!! Was really beautiful but the face is much darker in person and very hard to read.
1.0,"When I received the watches, one was not working at all! The other one had wrong time to I set it to correct time.....but then it kept lagging behind...after 30 minutes it was 10 minutes behind. Didn't think that changing batteries would help (anyway why should one have to purchase batteries for brand new watches!!!) So returned them right away! The watches are made of poor quality! ZERO STAR RATING!"
1.0,"Cheap, poor qua"
1.0,Not happy with them.  Much to large for a 6 year old.  Big and thick
1.0,"To small, the size doesn't match."
1.0,I ordered two of this product. It lists as a three pack of the item. I only received 2 socks so am missing 4 socks
1.0,Not true to size.  Bought as a gift and now have to scramble to find something else.  I guess for a size large you have to purchase a 2XL!!!
1.0,So cheap looking
1.0,"Maybe it was just me, but I ordered a set of XL in grey, and I got a set of L in a bag that was labeled XL.  Obviously manufacturer put wrong size in bag.  But when I returned to Amazon (with detailed information), they of course proceeded to replace it with ANOTHER set of mislabeled shirts.  So I just gave up and got a refund.<br />Meantime I found another brand (John Son) similarly priced that is a much thicker better quality shirt."
1.0,By the first wash it will have piling all over the sleeves and jacket.  For the cost it’s not with the time even for occasional wear.
1.0,There is not stamp with 925 sterlimg silver. So its just cheap cheap one for high price.
1.0,The key selling point on this pair versus the others was the fact that it actually came with remote after waiting almost a month for the product it didn't have a remote... should have went with the cheaper ones for my six-year-old son I bought a second pair at the same time and I had paid way less for my older child and got them in less than a week however that particular pair did not come with remote that's why it was cheaper... here I paid more waited longer and didn't even get what I paid for as these are Christmas gifts for my boys they haven't tried them on yet so I don't know how well they will even work or fit...
1.0,Very see through and thin material. Not something you could wear out in public in my opinion
1.0,"I bought the 4T for a niece and when I received it in the mail it was tiny, it literally fits my 12 MO daughter. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Small, but thick and just terrible"
1.0,Much too wide to adjust to my glasses.
1.0,"Before anything else, I like Clarks - I own several shoes from them, and know exactly what size I wear in Clarks, which is my regular 8.5. I was amazed at how uncomfortable these Sprint Lite Lace shoes were. First of all, they run small. Secondly, the toe box is constructed weirdly, tight in side spots but not uniformly somehow. Not like a narrow size, just... uncomfortable. Thirdly, the sole of the shoes has a high angle (more obvious in the pictures of the pink or white shoes) and my foot kept sliding forward - into a tight toe box.<br />I just returned them."
1.0,These nose ring are huge the gold nose by my thumb is a normal size nose ring. I’m definitely returning these
1.0,Not cute at all. Looks better on the picture
1.0,Was a whole size too small. The XL fit like a L.
1.0,These are so thin they do not hold their shape.
1.0,It's not what I've expected as this quick release spring bars is shorter than the regular spring bars. The str!o would fall of or got detached as its way too short.. No good.. cannot recommend this
1.0,muy mala calidad<br />no lo recomiendo caja rota estuche roto y lentes plasticos de mala calidad
1.0,Pretty material. Shows it has sleeves and it did not come with sleeves. Was for a present and needed sleeves. Gift was ruined.
1.0,Horrible quality. The chain in a week broke and was green. Ugh
1.0,NASTY
1.0,loved the dress just way to long
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. Poor cut.
1.0,Material cheap and flimsy.  No inner strings to tie dress together.
1.0,Fell apart within 2 minutes. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,The screws have already come out.
1.0,"Ordered a 5T, cannot use. Fits like a 2T"
1.0,I’m not going to lie …<br />It was extremely tight .. since I have big thighs it didn’t go up past my thighs
1.0,"The “corset top” fits around my body, but the cups for my chest are super thick and shaped really wide. The didn’t fit snug enough for coverage. I had use safety pins to clasp it closely to a bralette so everything wasn’t exposed. The gems fell off while I was trying it on for the first time, and the arm bands only fit my forearms."
1.0,Can't even see any of the digital features unless you press the button to turn the light on.
1.0,So cheaply made.  Not at all flattering.  Returned!
1.0,No pins came with it! I’ve never purchased a watch band that did not have pins. Useless without them and I’m not paying extra for them.
1.0,The size run small I order a 2X it fits like a Lg
1.0,not at all
1.0,"Was only one, not 24. Totally misleading"
1.0,More yellow than mustard like it looks on the model in the black jeans- was really hoping for mustard. Ordered Small twice and kept recieving Medium..runs big. Wanted a tighter fit. Will keep anyway since it was a Mother's Day gift from my Husband.
1.0,"I purchased a Cloud newborn hat to bring our son home from the hospital in. When I went to wash it, I was so disappointed to find the manufacturer's branding tag was on a black string and that dye had transferred to the interior of the hat leaving multiple striped dye stains. So sad to be returning and not using this product."
1.0,Ran way to big and wide
1.0,I hate this sweater. The fit on the sweater is completely bizarre. The sleeves and length of the sweater are both 3-4 inches too short and it's an almost but not three quarter sleeve. It's also split a couple inches up the side; well above the belly button. And overall it's weirdly boxy and totally unflattering. I was looking for a cozy oversized cable knit for a perfect autumn staple. This is not that sweater. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />For reference I am 5'7&#34; and I typically wear a size small.
1.0,The outfit was very small
1.0,Had to give it at least 1 star to review it.  This product sizing is way off. I did order 2 sizes up and it still didn't fit. The sizing should reflect more accurately.
1.0,"The face of the watch was really pretty, and I was even willing to overlook the scratch, but the strap began to rip IMMEDIATELY from the notch it came closed on (not the notch I wore it on for two minutes). I'm 99% sure the band isn't leather."
1.0,Las luces nunca le sirvieron
1.0,I would like to send this back but I had tried it on and got makeup on it. The blouse was not adjustable at all. Was very loose. I hated it
1.0,"The size delivered is in one size 58cm which is a large, I won't be able to wear it. It's too big. I would need a small."
1.0,Dress is shapeless.  Wide at the bottom. Tight at the top. Bland washed out colors. Not flaterring AT ALL
1.0,This bag lasted 3 months and then split at the seam all the way up. Cheap price for a cheaply made bag.
1.0,"Sorry, but it wasn't what I expected, to big for my fingers."
1.0,Colors are beautiful. Fabric is see through in all areas except the bust where it is double lined.
1.0,Cheaply made and took forever to arrive.
1.0,it’s cheaply made not worth it
1.0,Very cute but the gold finish rubbed off within a week and they are now silver
1.0,"bad, shirt was ripped 2 feet in back"
1.0,This dress was supposed to be a 3X which is a size bigger than what I needed BUUUUUUUUUUUUUT it was really a size 12 and very thin material.
1.0,"Awful, scratchy throughout the mask."
1.0,They ran out and I wanted the ring bad. 😔
1.0,This is the worst thing I have ever ordered from Amazon. Not even close to the shirt shown!!! I am 5’5 and 144 pounds. I ordered an extra large because I wanted it to be big. The sleeves are huge around the wrist.
1.0,Not a very good watch. Can't set the date as the directions say. Tried the stop watch and it stops on its own. Not impressed at all.
1.0,"This dress is poorly cut. The neck and bust are too large and the hips are tighter. A halter neck line is pretty difficult to get wrong (just make it a tie that's adjustable) but somehow these guys got it wrong- it's not a tie, and stitched in such a way that you couldn't even cut it and make it adjustable yourself. The fabric is rough, coarse and not nice, flowy or elegant. It's not chiffon or anything soft. I guess the only plus is that the black is not see-through. Maybe if you're very skinny and have an extra long neck/shoulder/torso, with big boobs then this cut might work for you, but it didn't fit me."
1.0,"This hat came to my house folded into a tiny package, purely felt, and something that could have been purchased from a dollar store.  The picture is deceiving.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,The necklace chain came all knotted up. Had to gift it without the chain because the knot was so tight the chain broke.
1.0,"Contrary to items selling points these masks are RIGID. They do not conform to your face. They are not machine washable nor are they meant to be cleaned with soap. The interior instructions tell you to essentially boil them to sterilize. Are they still functional? Probably, but they aren't as advertised."
1.0,Now the product itself was trash. Made out of Styrofoam and cloth. and cost too much. It arrived in a box that was too small and the head when expanded was bigger then box. Now i will say that the smiles on kids faces and those at work were well worth it but i should have bought the ones they wear at the parades in Japan instead.
1.0,The fringe on this cover up fell apart the first day I wore it before I even washed it. It was a complete mess.
1.0,Is this a joke? I order 14/16 for sizes of 10/12 girl as you said size up.  This would not fit my  11 year old  yet fit my 4 year old grandaughter like a dress of course with her being short! Disappointed
1.0,This belt pulled on my belt loops. Did not work as described. Very disappointed.
1.0,Came without belt holes. Other than that important detail it seems like a nice belt.
1.0,"The picture does not match the real thing, the quality is very poor, and it is very large, it breaks after only a month of wear"
1.0,"I did not like this item. I sold color me beautiful years ago when they had actual pieces of cloth to take with you to shop. I like the size, but that is all.  The colors are off, which is to be expected with print.  I felt it was very hard to shop with this item and is very overpriced. But I would not like it even for $10.  Returning it. Using my old cloth samples."
1.0,All I can say is doesn't fit and has a funny rim around the foot bed.  Footbed itself is uncomfortable with some fancy not useful spongy material in one spot.  Tops are cheap uncomfortable plastic.  Look okay at a distance.  Should I bother to return these?
1.0,"Really disappointed. Although the style is great, the fabric was not. See-through and flimsy which might be expected from this type of knit, but the one I received had several places where stitches were dropped and left obvious holes. Returned."
1.0,"I loved the color, but that is the only thing that is similar to the picture.  I certainly wasn't expecting quality, but this is SO ridiculously light weight it won't lay flat and curls in on itself, not a good look for jewelry.  I won't be returning it as it wasn't Prime and costs as much as I paid for it to return it, but I would never wear this.  Ah well, sometimes you gamble and win, sometimes you lose."
1.0,The description and the tag on the item show #1- 50  They were #51-100
1.0,Product did not last 5 months
1.0,Toooooooo Small<br />Very disapointed :<br /><br /> am very disappointed with this dress<br />I bought for my daughter and others to present my nieces<br />unfortunately one of the dresses on first use destroyed !!!<br />He tore whole and released until the waist band<br />I'd like a return and a position<br />this could not have happened !!<br />follow dress photo after three hours of use :(
1.0,"They are paper thin, ripped vertically on right leg as I put them on. I have skinny legs and couldn't rip across if it wasn't defective crap! The only reason I didn't return was they were cheap and I got what I paid for. Threw away immediately. Never buy!!"
1.0,"Not good quality, after a few wearing the earrings fell apart already."
1.0,Shipping took much longer than expected and stones were missing when it arrived. Very disappointed but I don't want to return due to the time it takes.
1.0,It is to tight for my wrist
1.0,It doesn’t look anything like the picture
1.0,I had two of these break within 5 minutes of wearing them.
1.0,"I am not pleased with this product. It's sized for children. I'm an adult male. Otherwise, it looks good."
1.0,"They were not what I expected, they were very short and I’m 5’4. I ordered a M and they didn’t even come pass my thigh."
1.0,Broke on first day worn
1.0,"Um no. It’s seriously stolen from a hotel uniform catalog. Boring, shapeless and terrible fabric"
1.0,"The bodice of the dress is way too small, unlike the photo.  It's a design problem, not a fit issue."
1.0,These are not cool. The picture shows them as regular sized glasses but they are actually super-sized.  Bug eyes. I do not like them.
1.0,"Strange fit, nothing like the photo."
1.0,Super cute! I thought it was for adults!
1.0,"amazon sent me a used package, already opened with masks clearly used before. Double check and make sure your masks and filters are sealed."
1.0,"When I first got this, I thought there might be other problems, as well, when I noticed that the zippers were so cheap that, even when brand new, they skipped teeth unless you were really careful.<br />Three days after I started using it, I was holding the lid shut whilst I fastened the zipper, and my finger penetrated the seam between the fabric and the zipper! Now it is ripped across the leading edge.<br />Two days after that, I noticed that the fabric is failing where the canvas shoulder strap supports are sewn on to it. Now, after a week, they are failing on both sides.<br />I replaced a very old and torn up bag with this new one, and, after a week, the new one is starting to resemble the old one. I will never purchase anything from these thieves again-I paid over $35 for this bag, and it did not even last three days in new condition."
1.0,The top is not made for a big girl to wear off one shoulder. Only skinny girls will look like the model showing the garment. I wear a 38GG and I look like a linebacker.
1.0,Broke in 2 days
1.0,Cheap plastic.. no pins holding the bows in.  Creaked when I opened the bows.  Would have broken in no time.  I returned them.
1.0,not what I was expecting at all. It was a thick and heavy material. I had to return it. Not flattering at all. I was very dissapointed.
1.0,"I ordered the black solid colored dress for work, size XL. Fit was ok, not tight but material is very, very thin. I would not order again."
1.0,Buttons popped off as soon as I received this sweater. Not made very well. Save your money.
1.0,Broke within 4 days of use
1.0,I ordered 3 and I am upset they are junk
1.0,"Ran very very small.  Very disappointed because I liked it when I saw it online.  Because of the price, rather than exchange it I will give it to a friend if it fits her, otherwise I will donate it."
1.0,"I was happy it arrived very fast but when it came...poor quality, sleeves are not even sewn I am sad and disappointed"
1.0,Pants are WAY too long & cheaply made. The shirt is horribly proportioned...Too big & too short! My daughter will never be able to wear it.
1.0,I was not impressed. Photos are deceiving
1.0,the size does not match and the material is artificial
1.0,Too small. Will take the return
1.0,I had to return it. It was broken in several places when I opened it !
1.0,"The hat was not I expected , poor quality and the rim is crooked and bent , cannot get it to straighten<br />The color was the only thing accurate"
1.0,"The 'POLICE' text was exceptionally crooked. At first, I thought, maybe it's my head! So I gave it the most authoritative test possible: The wife test.<br /><br />I put the hat on, approached my significant other, and said, &#34;Honey, is my head crooked?&#34;<br /><br />No wife would pass the opportunity to answer this question!<br /><br />&#34;No. Your hat is way off. What the heck?&#34;<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />Then I took a tape-measure (second best test, behind the wife test) and sure enough, the difference from the bottom of the P to the brim is about 1 1/3&#34;, and the difference from the E to the brim is just off of 1&#34;. Can't wear it.<br /><br />Making an exchange - hoping it's better."
1.0,"I purchased this item for my son. The item came with a cord necklace. My husband liked it so I ordered one for him. Exact same one, SAME PRICE, I just pressed the ""buy again"" button. The second one arrived without a cord, VERY INCONVENIENT. I feel I was ripped off. Same price should've received the cord too. Never again Steampunkers, Never purchase from you all again."
1.0,"Had high hopes for this. Would not fit on my Casio. Put two hours of solid effort, but it would not fit.<br /><br />Maybe others will have better luck."
1.0,The black robe I got felt and looked like a Halloween costume.  Especially compared to the one I kept -<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D7HPJHW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />Now THAT one is a quality robe!
1.0,Pulled out of package and everything looked good. Went to try on and it fell apart in my hand.
1.0,Very odd...I bought it in red and it was great; bought this one and felt as if it were made for quite a skinny woman.
1.0,It's FAKE
1.0,Plastic bag not completely sealed. No diamond in bag.
1.0,Absolutely terrible. Material is the worst crap I ever tried on. Felt like cardboard. And the ruffle is absolutely horrific....it was sticking straight up covering my face. It is not how it looks in these pics. Do not buy.
1.0,"Cute looking, but they do not stay up at all on bare legs.  Should be re-named &#34;ankle warmers&#34; as that's where they will be if you want to walk in them. I will have to sew in an elastic band in order to use them. I am 5'3&#34; tall and weight 128 pounds; my thighs are not thin."
1.0,Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't work for me. I would return but the seller charges and fee. Not happy!
1.0,Cute hat but mine had a hole in it!  Had to return
1.0,"I wear masks every day - cotton masks, surgical masks - all sorts. It is incredibly difficult to breath in this one. The fabric is dense and heavy. Even without inserting a filter, you have to inhale so hard to get a breath, and you'll start feeling light-headed pretty fast. If you put your hand in front of your face while wearing it and blow out, you'll feel literally nothing, so you can imagine how little air passes through the other way. I had my husband try it and he said the same thing - and he has much stronger lungs than mine. There are plenty of thick cotton masks and carbon filters that protect you and let you breathe. This one is unwearable - even for just a few minutes."
1.0,Rip soon as I put it on
1.0,"Please don't buy these other than for very light jobs.  I mean very light.  I bought these to remove bracelet links for my swiss watch and the tip literally twisted on my first try, rendering them useless.  I thought let me give it another try by using the spare tips and the same thing resulted.  I don't know what kind of metal these are made out of, but it almost feels soft as aluminum (I know they're not). I needed a 1mm sized tip, so I took a chance.  If you need a 1mm tip, do a search for &#34;1mm screw driver&#34; and buy a quality single screwdriver and not a cheap set like this."
1.0,"This is just a giant fail. It’s cheaply made. The pockets are horrible and don’t lay flat so they stick out. The material is thin and clingy so if you have a problem area, this will exacerbate it."
1.0,Supposed to be tortoise shell. Black.but worse than that they are counterfeit nock offs.  Vuarnet has no such model and the lenses are not etched with the V over the ski logo. They therefore; are fakes plain and simple.  I will be contacting Amazon for a full refund.
1.0,False advertisement! This product does not fit the CV2010 model and is not 20MM. The bracelet I received was already scratched as well.
1.0,Fabric was nothing like I expected - it much thicker and doesn’t create the “look” the photos portray - at all.
1.0,Wow they really should make it clear how tiny they are ended up giving them to someone who just had a baby.
1.0,This dress was gathered too much at the waist so the excess material made it look like a maternity dress.  Wasn’t happy with that look.  Material of the dress was good. Very disappointed.
1.0,Its a joke too thin on the back to be worth anything  of substance. Good concept needs to be better
1.0,You get what you pay. Cheap! thin snapped within 5mins while putting it on. My own experience isn’t a good one. Stay away! If you don’t Good luck!
1.0,"It is super big. I'm 5 feet 126 lbs and it fits like a large. Aside from that I am returning it because the pictures show the heart pattern on the whole item. Yet the pattern is only on the front. The back is a solid pink, no pattern at all."
1.0,Too thin. Had to return.
1.0,Loved it but it was to small would not zip up. had to return it due to not being able to zip up.
1.0,"* After further review, these are terrible. Finally cold enough to try them out. The wires used to construct these hurt your ears & poke out. Just not a well made product. Should have known by the price. Had bought a bundle years ago from somewhere that were in the same price range but much different quality.<br /><br />Not exactly what I was expecting. Thin fabric considering what they are meant to do which is keep you warm.<br />The back that goes around your neck is a wire, not sure how well that will hold up. They are not adjustable. The part that covers your ears is huge. suppose they will serve their purpose just not what I was expecting."
1.0,Went to put it on and it broke
1.0,Much much much too small. I ordered XXL fits like medium. Practically a belly shirt. Im 6&#34;2' 175lbs. An XXL always fits no matter what brand. If ur over 5&#34;10 do not buy these shirts they are very very small
1.0,"This is very cheaply made. It’s flimsy, the filters are not cut to fit properly. The holes do not line up. Made in China..with Chinese directions. Where are the instructions for assembly in English? Very disappointed. I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"My wife bought 5 units in Jan for herself and other family members from the sirensong website. Apparently there is a box that needs to be unchecked when purchasing OR else you you are subscribing for a monthly subscription charge. Apparently this charge is for a new unit each month?!?!? Because my wife ordered 5 units, her monthly subscription charge was $39.95 posted against her credit card 2 days ago. This practice is most unsavory."
1.0,Touchscreen way too sensitive.  Slips into setup mode when checking time.  As such not reliable at all.
1.0,Crappiest material ever. The sleeves are so wide and the fabric has no elasticity whatsoever. The seam in the waist has no elastic in it so you can even get it on.
1.0,"I thought these would be great glasses.  Unfortunately, each pair -- -within a week of using each -- lost screws and broke (one on the nose piece, and the others on the ear pieces).  They looked great and worked great for a whopping week each!!!  I super-glued the earpieces into their respective locations, minus the original screw.  If they hadn't all lost their screws, I would have given 5 stars."
1.0,Not made for grown ups..
1.0,Bag is very pretty and arrived on time. I couldn’t keep it as it was a bit scratchy when I put it on my shoulder. Paid $16.99 for the bag and was only refunded $7.61….buyer beware.
1.0,"I bought these in three colors and each one was sewn differently and still didn’t match the item descriptions measurements that I followed! I recently needed new clothes and purchased a good amount, this item being one of them. I appreciate Amazon’s variety and ease but I may return to in store clothing shopping since I received far too many defective items which I have to waste printer ink money and my time to now go return what quality control never should have passed and subsequently allowed to be sent out. Disappointing!"
1.0,Giving them as a xmas gift so I don’t know yet
1.0,Only received the brown pair and they didn’t even have the print like it shows in the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,No...they came broken in half.
1.0,Ordered a size bigger and it was still too small.  The straps are very thin material and curled on my shoulders.  Unwearable for me.  Might be fine for small busted ladies.
1.0,This shirt was nothing like the description.  Very short.  Not realistic to wear and looks nothing like the picture.  Will be returning ASAP.
1.0,"Material was so so. Looked better in the picture, after trying on didn’t care for the the dress. Very cheap quality"
1.0,moon Chris fell off the purse
1.0,Put it back together a few times until pieces of this were just missing and couldn't find. Not good quality at all!!!
1.0,These came in stained with no tags. Were obviously used and returned. Not worth the price at this point.
1.0,Save your money they don’t do anything but make everything yellow. Felt they actually made night driving worse!
1.0,Ordered the correct size as described but it was too small.  Was not satisfied at all.
1.0,"I ordered this medium to see if it would fit better than the small I already have because I love it but it's just a little smaller than I would like. This medium is not the same fabric! It's hot & uncomfortable, not breathable or stretchy or soft like the size small is even though it looks the same its not at all. Returning immediately. Picture is showing the small is 65% cotton / 35% polyester (perfect) and the medium (supposed to be the same item) as you can see is 100% polyester!?!? Hope the seller will fix it or no more money for them! Hope this helps someone else!"
1.0,"I ordered  an E & a J, but was sent two Es😑😑😑 I like the style & quality of it, just wish I'd gotten my J! M Blackshear Gallon"
1.0,They arrived broken.
1.0,"The color is not as depicted. The dress is more a mustard color than yellow. The dress is true to size, I am old slender built, 34B bust and ordered a Small and it fit perfect. However I am returning it because I am 6ft tall and the dress does not make it to my ankle. The quality of the dress feels nice and good as you would expect from a maxi flow dress."
1.0,"My necklace still hasn't straightened out, the &#34;clear fishing string&#34; they probably used is very curly, so when I put it on it doesn't lay flat on my chest. Looks like a very cheap product. Wouldn't buy again or recommend for any occasion."
1.0,Too small and tight for husbands hands.
1.0,Fits fine kn the butt but waaaay too long
1.0,front strap breaks all the time always repairing
1.0,I ordered my normal size and it was the size of one of my thighs.
1.0,"POOR QUALITY. Never wore, just washed once and there is a hole in the side!! One of the buttons fell off. It is super large in the chest area and small in the waist. I can’t even wear it with the hole that was produced with the FIRST WASHING. VERY disappointed and will be attempting to return. don’t waste you money on this one"
1.0,"I couldn't get this top on,  to see if it would fit. It is made horribly. Whoever did purchase this item and it worked for them, you were lucky. It only looks good on the internet."
1.0,"These do not look like the picture, they were really cheap looking. And if you wear them for more than a few hours they start to smell terrible from sweating."
1.0,"Product fit.....terrible. the high waist rolls over on you whenever you lean side to side, or bend over or walk. Just don't do it man, spend the extra few dollars and get a better pair"
1.0,"Was pretty disappointed, I was expecting a nice soft hoodie.  The fabric is a slick nylon type blend.  Not a warm snuggly shirt at all.  Maybe I missed something in the description....  the print is also pretty blurry, again, maybe I missed something.  It’s just not at all what I was looking for."
1.0,The straps have zero stretch and just squish the girls out both sides of the top. Size reference 42/44K.
1.0,"These are cute but, not protective or high quality.<br /><br />The straps unraveled after 2 wears."
1.0,"Ripped down the whole side first day I wore it, material is thin, cheap, and did not hold up on my vacay, disappointing."
1.0,"They look gross. They're not white, they're like a murky gray."
1.0,I bought these for my fiance' and she wore them once.  In that time the fingers unrivaled and the Velcro came off.  stitching is weak and cheaply made
1.0,"spent $25 on a compression shirt for a 6 year old who IS small, and the shirt was too small and way too tight. I really wanted him to be able to wear this under his tshirts at school but he says its very uncomfortable and its too small!  product SHOULD come in at the very least a 3 pack as i can't believe 1 shirt was $25!"
1.0,Extremely disappointed that my ring came smashed. It was such a beautiful design and the size would have been slightly bigger. The baggy says size 6 but it is more like a size 8 but that would have been fine for me since I'm a sizes 7.
1.0,"These were such a cheap plastic poorly constructed mess. I gave them a shot anyway but they couldn't even get close to my prescription which is for reading only. The concept is interesting, but these went right back."
1.0,Do not order!  Straight up junk!
1.0,"Fabric is thick and does not breathe, Its like a sauna."
1.0,Not a good quality  first use and they were ripped. Waste of money
1.0,"The dress I okay on the hanger but doesn’t look the same on. The skirt part is narrower at the bottom than at the waist, which makes it bubble out slightly, giving the illusion of gigantic hips. Not what anyone wants. It just makes me look a lot heavier than I am. Not flattering at all. Unfortunately I missed the return window so I guess I’ll be donating it."
1.0,Purchased and it is very cute but it had a huge hole where the body fabric meets the tulle. Exchanged it for the same thing and this one also has hole in the same place. No option to exchange so will be returning.
1.0,Wasn’t anything like what the photo loookef like on the Amazon page o immediately sent it back to Amazon.
1.0,"I wanted to wear it as a dress, but looks more like a bathrobe. Fabric is too thin."
1.0,Sent me the wrong item. Too small ring.
1.0,"Where do I start? First of all they are thin, see through when you bend over & have zero amount of compression.  I wore the camo ones once and within the first hour I had sagging around the knees.  I suppose if I were simply wearing them around the house it would be fine, but I actually work out. Don't waste your money.  I'm returning mine):"
1.0,"Poor quality fabric. Bought these for my husband who wears them normal fit - not tight, not oversized. And he is not overweight but he bent down after two days of wearing them and they ripped! Not in the seam but in the middle of nowhere - which leads to me believe it's just cheap fabric. And every pocket corner and belt loop has a hole starting!! I am in the garment manufacturing industry and this is overall just cheap work."
1.0,"They have swastikas on them. They are in the trash and out of my home, which stinks bc my twelve year old ordered them for me for Christmas.  Disgusted.  Disappointed in the Chinese manufacturer."
1.0,"This sun hat looks great in the photo, however, totally different upon receipt. It's mishapen, hot glue strings are in several places, and the bow itself is hot glued to the hat ( it's completely visible....the hot glue around and under the bow).  Disappointed, to say the least."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, very cheap looking.  You would have thought they came from out of a gum ball machine.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. I gave mine away"
1.0,The fabric is very rough in texture. No cuddle here! Returning. Very uncomfortable!
1.0,Wish i can give it a no star. Do not buy. The ring is cheaply made and one broke same day i wear it
1.0,This watch is SO cute and stylish but it doesn't keep time. It gets behind in time by 30-60 minutes and then at times it will just freeze up entirely. Not worth it even for that price.
1.0,Awful. Confusing because I thought it was a pair and I received only one earring. Who would want to wear only one earring???
1.0,The earrings were not included. There was an empty plastic package labeled “earrings” but there were no earrings inside
1.0,Very cheap material and I aas sent the wrong color.
1.0,"Broke on arrival... even superglue them back and they fell apart again... cute, but cheap and then not worth the hassle to return/ replace"
1.0,Produces a headache. I saw worse than without them
1.0,The sizes are smaller than what is advertised. Order a size up. I’m 5’7” and 135-140 lbs and I order a medium
1.0,"Very disappointed. Shirt was faded. Looked like it was worn. The size seemed small, like it shrunk."
1.0,"Just received.  Loved the color, but  must return.  Too heavy, and too large."
1.0,It was all broken and there were no clasps.
1.0,"The footbed is not designed to cradle your foot, unless your feet are narrow rectangles, 90 degree angles on the edges. If your feet are rounded, as feet typically are, these will not feel good at all."
1.0,"Doesn't fit anything like the picture. The ""arms"" look stupid.  Terrible dress"
1.0,much smaller than picture indicated.  will be returning this.
1.0,I hand washed this dress once in cold water / hang dry and it shrunk.  I had to wear it to bed to hope that it would stretch back out and it did.  I washed it the second time and it shrunk again. Too much drama and effort/
1.0,I'm a big dude and these were way too small. The fabric was stiff and scratchy and way more see through than I was expecting.
1.0,very cheap low quilty
1.0,"Way too small, I’m 5’1 and 113lb and a size small did not fit me"
1.0,This would of been a dress that was ok.Maybe not great but at least ok.I followed the sellers descriptions.And measurements..So I ordered a medium for the waist and small hips.The hips are very full.They stick out along with the inside tag.The length is about the only thing that was accurate.Buyer beware<br />It is cut very odd.Definitly not a fitted bodycon dress with the cut and measurements provided for buyer's.I should of just ordered a small<br />But I followed the seller's chart.
1.0,I didn't even take them out of the package.  They are made so cheap.  I could tell they would not last.  Buyer beware.
1.0,I like the watch when I got it but after 3 days of wearing the pin holding the clasp came out and the watch fell off and the back popped off.  Cant find the pin and cant get the back to go back on.  If i hadnt broken it I would return it.  For the money buy a name brand with a warranty.
1.0,Cannot give a good review...........poorly made with lot of imperfections in the item. Returned them....poor quality to give as a gift.
1.0,The way they put the sizes is so confusing so needless to say I ordered the wrong size I meant to return this item an forgot now I'm not allowed to return it ! Bunch of B.S it's not right they are allowed to do that to people !!!
1.0,As soon as I opened my package it stunk my entire kitchen up like Vinegar. The smell was so heavy and overwhelming I felt sick almost immediately. I will be returning.
1.0,Stay away. This material is junk. It's clearly the cheapest stuff made poorly.
1.0,Looks and feels like plastic - do t but it!
1.0,I ordered and paid for a two piece set and the pants did not come with the hoodie. Super disappointed. I thought I was buying a set because that's what it said I ordered in my cart. 😡
1.0,These earrings are quite thick and are very hard to put on and take off. I spent half an hour taking them off and ended up bleeding from my cartilage piercing. It was very painful. I don’t recommend this item. I regret buying this
1.0,I followed the advise of other reviewers and bought at least one size up. It's very comfortable. But it doesn't look like the picture. The purple was discolored and the flower pattern is a rather lurid shade of green. The material is also shiny and I saw a woman wear one out of the local discount store. So I wasted money finding this online only to find out it's being sold by discount stores around the world....
1.0,Tiny and overpriced. The metal is thin and will easily bend out of shape in no time. Returned it.
1.0,"I was caught by the tv ads while working out.<br />That was the WORST thing I've ever bought. Same problem with doubled order. Filthy product.<br />The site is really deceptive: you never see the total price, you can't go back to change!!! I hate myself for letting those scumbags know my visa card information.<br />Please, please, don't be stupid like me."
1.0,It wasn’t flattering at all and really cheap looking.
1.0,This item was not like the picture at all. The beads on the earring and not placed well and looks nice poorly made. The fan on the earring is too large unlike the picture. This was a disappointing purchase. I would not recommend.
1.0,Terrible quality. Loose strings hanging from the seems.
1.0,nothing  like the picture once i open the bag it smells like ocean had bad fish smell to it about to send it back<br />waste time and money was for husband anniversary  but i pass on this nothing like pictures waste of 💵
1.0,"Not the best out there ,! The hinge pin came out have too look for another one"
1.0,I wore it in heavy rain and it soaked through in less than 5 minutes. Also had a ripped inner pocket when it was delivered. Very poor quality.
1.0,These do not appear to be new - the blue metal piece on each key ring is scratched and I mean significantly scratched. There is no way I can give these away to people in this condition. I bought them as little thank you’s for employees who go above and beyond<br /><br />I can’t believe someone would even send an item out in this condition<br /><br />REALLY disappointed
1.0,"I intended to use this as an alternative to a face mask for COVID.  When it arrived, I unfolded it and stretched it a bit to see how thin it was (I'm looking for really breathable & lightweight).  It was really thin, so I was happy about that, but I noticed right away that it had 2 small holes in it, which I was willing to overlook.  The top and bottom are literally just the raw edges of cut fabric, not a sewn edge or anything.  Then I put it to my face to test the breathe-ability.  It was kind of stinky so I of course went to wash it.  I washed it by hand and the water instantly turned a dark brown.  Okay, maybe it's excess dye as it is black??  So I wash it again, brown water.  Wash it again, brown water.  I washed it a total of 7 times in soapy water and the water was still coming out brown.  There's no way I'm putting this around my face and breathing through it.  No thanks."
1.0,"Fit awkwardly, waistline hit way too high. :("
1.0,Very cheesy knockoff
1.0,It looks like a tall hat. It is not!<br />It’s very short.
1.0,Not for DD size breast no support so Lord not enough fabric when you tie it up

1.0,Bad quality very cheap and came to me broken would never buy again
1.0,Chains broke same day we got them.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,Purchased this a few years ago. Came as described exact copy vachetta leather with LV stamp on brass parts. Ordered it again this month - got a plastic piece of crap not leather not as described and no stampings.<br />Don’t waste your money unless you want a plastic strap.
1.0,"OMG!!!!! I ordered size small, tag says small but it looks like my whole family can fit inside. It is extremely large size like xxxxxl."
1.0,This is very cheap material and and very small and does not stay open when expanded
1.0,Cheap construction.
1.0,This is very cute but I put it on and it broke.  The hat part broke from the headband part.
1.0,This was way too small. It actually fits my 9 year old
1.0,Extremely loose around the wrist… wrinkly… just poor quality. Like wearing a trashbag..
1.0,"Poorly made, can barely see what it says... the ink is white with a chrome backround... who thought of this"
1.0,Fell apart in less than a week after buying very disappointed
1.0,The dress is super small to be an Xl
1.0,"Don't be fooled, read all the way down to the bottom of the detail section... this does NOT come with hair!! You are paying for a 12 dollar strip of cotton.  They want you to buy the hair/ bangs separately.  Very disappointing that they would be so deliberately misleading.  It's not a &#34;hat's with hair&#34; it's hats with headband and the picture and lack of mention in anything but the fine details is deceptive."
1.0,Loved the fit and the look of this jacket but you could completely see the shoulder pads and any shirt underneath… I’m sure the other colors are great but not the white one!!
1.0,Way to small for anyone bigger than a size 0!
1.0,chrome finished wore off in 2 days started to crack peeled right off
1.0,One lense popping out already. Better quality at corner stores
1.0,"CHEAPPPPPPPPPP looking, feeling, fitting 🤮"
1.0,"Highly disappointed in the condition. These were clearly worn and used. The CQR package was torn open and the pants were muddy. The appear to have been worn outside then folded neatly, placed back in the bag and returned.<br /><br />I ordered this last pair of 103 style pants. I like the fit and style however they should have been sold as worn and not new."
1.0,Don’t waist your money!!! Both of the clasps broke within the first day.
1.0,Too large even after washing. Would not stay up on face.
1.0,The sneakers caused a burn to my child's leg.  I looked and looked to contact the seller but there was no way I could find to communicate with them!  I am extremely disturbed by this product and lack of ability to communicate
1.0,"Leggings are very thick and would be good for outdoors. However, there were fuzzy balls all over the fabric after the first wash! I am very disappointed in the quality of the material."
1.0,too hard to grip
1.0,Very poor quality. Waist band is not elastic enough.
1.0,"Cheap The round boob padding was showing through the dress, the sequence shed EVERYWHERE the second it came out of the bag. Belt over skit is a cheap, not well fitting piece also.  Again NOTHING like Image shown."
1.0,Garbage don't purchase.
1.0,not what expected  - the back too light and thin very easily to rip off and dress no good to be used again - need to take to tailor to fixed it
1.0,Blouse torn in two places. Item looked used and as if came out of a dumpster. There was another rip that was hand stitched with white thread on the black material.<br /><br />Flimsy see through material loose elastic will not stay in place with normal activity.. this Item in good condition would Be worth $5. It is so unfortunate as the style and fit would be great if made with better quality materials.
1.0,Poorly made shoe.
1.0,"As soon as I hooked this to my wallet, one of the rings broke. Now I have a chain with no way to hook it to anything. Thankfully my cat finds shiny things fun to play with."
1.0,"Poor material, broken upon delivery"
1.0,Legs were too long so crotch was a little saggy. Wish they made an XS
1.0,Very uncomfortable and run small. I will be returning these.
1.0,Fabric was terrible and looked cheap
1.0,Shirt shrinks after wash
1.0,"junk , broken parts missing"
1.0,Polka dots are much larger than the picture. Pockets are a great idea but add a lot of bulk to the hip area. If you have a chest at all don’t buy. Does not lay right. I’m 5’4” and normally a small. The length was good but everything else was terrible.
1.0,Seam tore on the first wear....
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes up and they still don’t fit.
1.0,Broke after the first day of having it. Poorly made.
1.0,no please with the product it only lasted a couple days and then it went black and can not be used.<br />would not recommend this product.
1.0,Purchased size XL and ended up giving them to my 12 year old.  Teeny-tiny.
1.0,"WORST SILICONE BRA EVER!<br />ONLY WORE THEM ONCE AND THE SILICONE PLASTIC?  STARTED PEELING OFF. FROM THE INSIDE..????<br />I KNOW THEY COME WITH A PLASTIC THAT PROTECTS IT WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT, YOU PEEL IT OFF BEFORE YOU APPLY TO YOURSELF, NO, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY GLUED A PLASTIC THAT HAD SILICONE ON TOP<br />CHEAPPPP.<br /><br />IVE HAD AND USED THESE KINDS OF BRAS FOR A LONG TIME, EXCEPT IVE BAUGHT THEM IN STORE AT AGACI<br />COUPLE DOLLARS CHEPER TOO MIGHT I ADD,<br />LASTED ME A GOOD WHILE, I HAVE LOTS OF STRAPPY DRESSES SO ITS A MUST I HAVE THIS KIND OF BRA @ALL TIME<br /><br />THIS PURCHASE WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!<br />NOT TO MENTION I PAYED NEXT DAY DELIVERY AND IT GOT TO MY HOUSE AFTER I NEEDED IT AND HAD WENT OFF TO WORK<br />ARRIVED AFTER 8P - UGHHH"
1.0,"Very thin frames, metal easily bendable. returned"
1.0,Material very thin and cheap looking.
1.0,I wish it didn't scratch so easily. I took it out of the hard to open plastic wrap and scratched the gold off with my nail!
1.0,"4 holes in the first 3 hours I had them on, save your money."
1.0,"This item was way too big, I got a size large because I’m very curvy in the hip area. I drowned in this dress, it is not mid-thigh length. It went down to my knees. Beautiful color, cheap fabric."
1.0,Logo wasn’t straight and very small.
1.0,"I couldn’t figure out how to put them together, it was no instructions on it so I sent them back ."
1.0,Horrible! Fit too big and small at the same time if that’s possible. Tried to return but was going to cost me $258 in shipping. Don’t buy this garbage.
1.0,Too large. Looks like it was made for a giant. I usually wear 18-20 but decided to go down a few sizes and buy a XL. I even tried giving it to my mother who is 6 feet and 300 pounds and it didn't fit her either. Only thing that was nice was the color.
1.0,Zipper broke the first day. cheap materials and small.
1.0,The description says these are clip-on ear rings. They are not.
1.0,The price and package description indicate six pairs of socks.  Only received one.
1.0,"weird design, could not put them on"
1.0,Talla súper pequeña
1.0,"The clasps on these earrings are horrible with no elasticity. One broke on my first attempt to open them. Company offered a refund, but you have to pay for return shipping."
1.0,"Low quality materials, looks and feel cheap. And super small."
1.0,"What is going on? I just washed these socks for the first time, before ever wearing them, and ALL have loose threads on the top! Are they unraveling? Should I sew them or return them? I don't have the packaging materials anymore.  They are soft and thick, but I cannot recommend due to this shoddy workmanship."
1.0,Literally put it in and wore for five minutes before realizing the straps had completely torn - 3 of the 4 straps. Comes in size large but definitely actually capable of withstanding a larger bust. Have had success with cute-style workout bras from other brands but never purchasing from Gaiam after this.
1.0,My wife says they poke her in the side
1.0,"i do not like to do bad reviews, but even after i sent the item back and asked for a refund it looks as if i will not get my money back. I vest did not turn on and no power light ether, and it would shut of my battery. sll"
1.0,"First off, the material was just bizarre. I dont' even know how to describe it except that it was not soft or comfortable. Definitely not ""chiffon"" or anything remotely close. Maybe more like a fabric napkin? Anyhow, the fit seemed off as the waist area seemed tight and the fit across the bust was generous (and I am not small busted). I'd look for a different brand if you are searching for a top like this one. It just wasn't for me."
1.0,These are the most cheaply made glasses Ive ever seen.  They are worse quality than a dollar store.  Plastic is flimsy and bendable.  Glasses came bent and do not sit on the face correctly.  Even my 8 year old told me they were garbage.  Wish a zero star choice was an option.
1.0,It looked so pretty in the picture but it didn't look like that in real life. The center stone is teeny tiny. I had to return it.
1.0,Very flimsy fabric and the sewing is not well done.  Colors are overly bright and unattractive.
1.0,"Awful,cheap,pieces were missing"
1.0,Too thick/wide for any tennis shoes I've ever had.  Looks kinda weird.
1.0,"Surprisingly NOT well made. Second time I went to put them on, one of the arms went flying off. Looking at what holds them together tells the story. It is a very flimsy piece of aluminum (?). What a cheap product, but you do get what you pay for."
1.0,Very poor quality. Barely worked and for the price this things was junk. I was very disappointed in this product. And I returned it!
1.0,these shorts are VERY baggy and not form fitting.  I wanted to go running in these but they would absolutely dropped the phone from the inner pocket.
1.0,IT broke off my apron the 1st day
1.0,"My daughter wore the white pair once, and there are runs in them! I will be returning them."
1.0,"Ever order your favorite food on the menu, only to find that the company changed the recipe? That's what happened with this online item.  This evening sleepwear used to be fitted, comfortable and...sexy.  But the company changed the fabric and size parameters.  Now everything in a small size is built for a heavy set short female with large, fat legs and an extra wide torso.  The shorts literally look like my husband's XL boxers on me.  Does the designer assume that all Americans are built like cows?  Ordered five items of various colors so I know it's not just a factory fluke.  Very disappointed."
1.0,See through looks like cheap material
1.0,I didn’t receive the print in the ad. The American flag was wrong. I received one that had “4th of July” on it. I am returning. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheaper quality 😡 waste of money.
1.0,"I ordered a small, looks more like a large and feels like a large.. don't know if they gave me the wrong size but the dress isn't pretty on. It's very thin... like paper thin. I was hoping it was going to be beautiful but I was so disappointed when I received it. I don't ever give bad ratings unless I really feel it's necessary. Skip this one.. I got the light pink and white dress.. not sure if the other colors are better."
1.0,These were ugly and looked stupid.
1.0,Hideous material
1.0,Band cost me my 300 dollar Galaxy watch. It's comfortable but unreliable. Watch fell off in the lake. I had warranty threw Best buy but wouldn't honer it because it only covers damaged watch not lost.  So needless to say I wouldn't trust this band. Very frustrated
1.0,"Disappointment . Cheap fabric, runs small . The size dose not correspond the size guide, runs way smaller!!<br />Vendor should be more efficient with sizing and better the quality"
1.0,"Junk. Cheap. It's very difficult to change the lenses out. The glue that holds the extra lenses' pad, inside the case, failed which is cheap and sad. I would recommend Rivbos sunglasses. That's what I ended up buying."
1.0,Size and color are nothing like what I expected.
1.0,I originally ordered a black size small. It had a nice liner. I bought a second one in green size medium as a gift. The green one was a size medium and was smaller than the black small. The green one also came with no liner and was not as good quality as the black one. Inconsistent items. Please send me a return label. Thank you!
1.0,not the size expected - kidda bad materials
1.0,Picture is misleading.  Glasses are considerably smaller. Returned them
1.0,These pants are ridiculous. I only purchased because they claimed to be linen/cotton. There is not a thread of natural fiber in these things. Totally synthetic! And the color is a garish blue - not subdued like in the photos. Do not buy! Totally false advertising and they have a thoroughly disappointed/unsatisfied customer.
1.0,"This dress was just awful. The worst feeling fabric, kind of felt like I was wearing a tablecloth. This dress was super unflattering and hung weird. Little to no stretch! I ordered this because of the good price, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Looks cheap, not leather and strap doesn’t stay tied."
1.0,"This is cute and all but... The bar was not shaped like any other bar that I have used before. Like it curved to sharply, making it uncomfortable. I cannot wear this for more than an hour without getting imitated by it and removing it."
1.0,Nice piece but cheap ends silver already wearing off after just two months.
1.0,"I really liked the dress, I ordered a small first & it was too tight, then I ordered a Medium and it was too loose around the armpits & hips. The biggest problem with both sizes was there is a layer of lining that runs directly across the chest area & you can see the line it makes! The way it was sewn together it couldn't just be cut out. Disappointed."
1.0,"This item is too flimsy and impossible to wear, it doesn't even fit a teenager it looks like it was made by party City for a 5-year-old. It has no structure and the material is horrible. Do not get this item unless you want to get scammed. This is not worth $16 it is worth $5 or less"
1.0,size is not what it represents.  it would struggle to fit a child or small adult properly.  it also has a no return policy.  just be sure it is what you need before ordering.
1.0,"After reading the previous reviews I made sure to order up.  I'm a size 8/Medium and ordered both the Large AND the Extra Large knowing I would return whichever one didn't fit.  As it turns out, BOTH were entirely too small.  I only actually tried on the XL which was very snug in the mid section and so short in the torso area that it was splitting me right down the ... middle!  That being said I didn't even bother trying on the Large one.  This really should be advertised as children's wear.  Returning both of these."
1.0,The stone does not match the leather. Very cheap quality!
1.0,Size was bigger than said
1.0,They are so small that I can wear them.
1.0,"I normally wear a size 10 womens in most boots. Ugg and emu size 10 but I couldnt even get these on. At all. I would say order a full size up at least. Maybe a size and a half. If you like to wear thick socks, get 2 full sizes bigger. I ended up giving them to a friend that wears a size 8 normally and she said they fit great and still have a little room for thick socks.<br />They are cute, but not run way too small."
1.0,Very small very small
1.0,Sadly this was made for someone very small. I'm not that person!
1.0,"Would give zero stars if I could. Wore them once and the fabric is so thin and cheap there was a hole in them after one wear. They also gave me blisters on my heal somehow. You can see your toes through the sock, that is how thin this material is."
1.0,The metal pins are useless. They don't fit the Ace 2 (which they advertised they did) at all. Such a waste.
1.0,"Does not even resemble the picture. Save your money, do not buy this."
1.0,Was nothing lime the picture.
1.0,"terrible! the image was completely distorted. I use cheap clip ons for fishing, i flip them up and down to tie hooks. The price was right but performance was useless"
1.0,Cute..but the posts aren't long enough to put backings on.... fall off your ears because of it....
1.0,This is a cheaply made item and not true to size.  Buyer beware! and item cannot be returned.  Looks nothing like the product they are trying to sell you!  I wish Amazon would stop selling cheap products !
1.0,"If you're thick and weigh 180, I suggest getting a large. I love them and they always feel nice but they're not stretchy. Not see through though!"
1.0,This is Not flattering at all!<br />The material is very cheap and flimsy I can even see the seams where they sewed it.<br />Immediately want a return<br />Don’t go by the picture!
1.0,My chain broke the first day I wore it
1.0,They must have blown the pic of these earrings up by 1000X because these earrings are so tiny I could barely see them. These are must be for an infant. Returning
1.0,"I don't understand how I could've been sent this dress wIth such a horrible smell! I almost threw up with how bad it smelled. It was clearly used and whoever returned it and shipped it to me didn't even have the audacity to wash it. I ordered 3 different dresses from amazon and this one was my favorite, but unfortunately it was sent in horrible conditions. I loved it so much I even considered just washing it, but my husband convinced me of how unhygienic it would've been."
1.0,I liked how the dress looked but I noticed that the dress was ripped on the lace on the bottom and the fabric on the bottom is longer then the lace the silver button that was  suppose to be in the front came without it
1.0,Too small I wear 2x and this was no where near mi size had to give it away
1.0,I’m 5foot 6 tooooo short I wish this was made for all heights
1.0,If you like very tight spandex on your head this is for you. This was way to tight and small.
1.0,"Curses to the person who invented bras! As with shoes, you really need to try these on before you buy. This bra just has too much going on! Inside the cups there are like two different layers going in weird directions and you really have to jiggle the bra around to center it on your boobs. What's weird is that while the straps and the part that goes around your chest and your back is comfortable it is also loosey-goosey at the same time while the rest of the bra is tight. I ordered an extra large which works for me on other types of bras, but definitely not this one. It seems like two different sizes. Also, one of the shaping cups had a dent in it which showed when wearing a t-shirt."
1.0,"I bought these and quickly found out why o should have passed ..the string unravels as soon as you wear them with your glasses . I thought it was a fluke but nope, all of them"
1.0,"I loved the dress but it was way too long amd didn't want to pay to have it hemmed.  Ordered a medium and I'm 5'6.""  Would have been fine with heels but I can't wear heels."
1.0,"This belt is nothing like the image advertised on the site. Also, it was not the size I ordered. I ordered a black belt and received a noticebly red belt, I can't wear it to work as it is very distracting and does not match a majority of my dress shirts. Very disappointing"
1.0,"This jacket is such a disappointment!  It looks nothing like the picture.  It's very flat due to The vacuum sealed bag.  The lining is uncomfortable and noisy.  I'm 5'5, 144 lbs and I wear a size 2-4.  I ordered a size small.  The body was a little loose, but the sleeves were too short"
1.0,I didn't like it and anyway I returned one of the two sets prior to the return date. But I still didn't get my money back.
1.0,"Horrible quality, extremely thin and cheaply made. Ripped the belt loop just pulling them up my leg. Holes look like I just took a knife and cut a straight line."
1.0,"I really wanted to like these earrings.  They are different and cute.  One fit just fine, the other came bent and never stayed on the way it should.  It looked crooked.  The biggest problem I had is that I don't think they're sterling silver, as the description stated.  I have very sensitive ears and can only wear nickle-free earrings.  Sterling silver would have fit the bill, yet these caused the usual allergic reaction within a couple of hours."
1.0,"The colors here are misrepresentative of what I received: Mine is fluorescent pink.  I know that colors are slightly different on different computers... but this is completely different.  I'm debating whether to return it, bc I'm not sure it's worth the hassle.  But beware, it's not what it looks like.  : /"
1.0,"Very, very thin material.<br />Would not wear in public."
1.0,This shirt feels like it is made out of plastic. Awful. I retuned it.
1.0,"What a piece of Chinese garbage. It took forever to get it, then when I opened it it was broken inside the package."
1.0,Gold finish gone on 2nd day....worth about $1!!! What you expect to get out of a gumball machine!
1.0,Ran about 3 sizes too large
1.0,They’re completely sheer and my normal size was far too small. These were really disappointing to try on. I returned them.
1.0,DO NOT use this in automotive paint!!!!! It is not resistant to the solvents. I mixed up a quart and 12 hours later it was black! The black flake was bleeding into the clear binder. I have flake from another company mixed from a year ago that still looks like it was mixed yesterday!
1.0,The picture was not accurate to the received product. Horrible refund policy. Paid $6.45 then got back a whole $1.63 refund. Buyer beware.
1.0,After wearing 1 time it broke.
1.0,Straps on side of purse are pulling away and I bought it 4 month ago and did not use this bag too much.
1.0,I ordered those dress to have a cute alternative to wear in the winter however this dress was extremely tight it had no stretch to it hardly any and I have had to return it unfortunately. If you’re going to get this I would definitely recommend sizing up one to two sizes. Please note I am now one of these irate irrational unrealistic Amazon reviewer‘s that is in denial about their true size and weight. 90% of the things I order on Amazon are mediums unless I read the reviews and it recommends otherwise.
1.0,"I was so excited for this shirt, but when I received it I was VERY disappointed. The shirt fit way smaller than expected and it had stains all over the front! It looked like I had received a shirt that was previously returned. Definitely will not be ordering again!!!!"
1.0,"The fabric is soft but the fit is awful! I'm 5'7"" & I ordered a small, but the length is weirdly long & unflattering. It was too late for me return it."
1.0,"I used the slippers  just for in house wear. I was disappointed in the quality of it. It wasn't long before these slippers became too loose on my feet. But I was especially disappointed  with the slippers developing holes and having the inside stuffing come out.  And this was just from walking in my own home mostly on carpeting and  not outside with adverse weather or stony, rocky, or sharp  surfaces.  I wish I could purchase a pair of slippers that are both comfortable and durable."
1.0,Didn't stay on my ear
1.0,Blouse was very nice prior to washing. 1st wash was on a gentle cycle and in cold water. After the wash the blouse shrunk and the material looks awful. I had to throw it away xannot be worn again.
1.0,"This hat was bent beyond saving because of how its shipped, plus its more of a peach color than pink."
1.0,Material is cheap thin
1.0,After 6 months the rivet failed. Others have had the same issue
1.0,"For the high price first rate quality should be expected. However,  these shoes were the worst I've purchased.  The fit is accurate. But the straps don't stay put as the velcro strips are too tiny to hold the straps in place rendering the straps useless. Thus, one isn't able to use the shoes at all.<br />Also they claim to be non skid which is s lie. They slip even on carpeting.<br />It was a waste of good money.<br />I do not recommend these shoes nor this brand."
1.0,Terrible product. Didn't fit into anything. Just worthless! Many better ones on the market.
1.0,It wasnt the size i ask for this shirt came 2x i ask for a large in then it Took alinga time to get it it look nothing like the picture
1.0,"The beads are sturdy, but the cross and middle part of Rosary very poorly made. There is no detail and it looks awful. I'm returning them."
1.0,Es muy chiquita
1.0,Bought these intending to have my kids use them. I would not recommend them for use unless you plan on wearing a mask underneath it. Might as well be made of panty hose material it is so see through. Can use as a headband or even for light cleaning. I would not buy again.
1.0,Arrived broken and unwearable and there is no return option. I see now there's several reviews that read the same. Save yourself the trouble.
1.0,the pads are to thin and don't hold the oils to well. can barely get the smell of the oils. do not like this product at all.
1.0,Stitching started to unravel after a few wears
1.0,"im not sure if everyone makes them like this these days, but the brim is flimsy. Not satisfied at all."
1.0,Returned because the post bent when I tried to put it on for the first time.
1.0,This shirt does not fit as expected in correlation with the sizes.
1.0,Item is too expensive
1.0,Terrible quality.  Turned into a hairy dish cloth after one wash in which instructions were followed very carefully
1.0,Purchased this dress and it came with a foul odor and two holes under the arm. The replacement dress received is a complete different fabric percentage make up. Details say 90/10. It looks like the fabric ruffles on the sleeves and bottom of the skirt were flipped on replacement received. Returning both.
1.0,We never did figure out how this worked.  My husband put it on and was unable to release it and we ended up having to cut it off of him.  Should come with instructions.
1.0,UPDATE: I emailed the company after they sent a generic email asking how I liked the watch and no response.  This was a week ago.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.  I got this as a Birthday present and wanted to adjust the time and date before I gave it to my friend. It came in this beautiful packaging and is a beautiful watch but it's broke. So much for that!
1.0,Small and the sleeves were very short.
1.0,Ripped on first use. I'm a size 12 and the XL was too tight
1.0,"You can't see a thing outta it, and the eye part smashes your own eyes! Not worth the money at all"
1.0,It’s flimsy does not hold it shape I wouldn’t even give you two dollars for it
1.0,This came apart and broke the first time my grandson put it on.  Total waste of money.
1.0,I thought this was for a child when I ordered it.It's way too big for that.
1.0,"First, the socks are pretty small.  Just FYI if you are tall and wear an 8 or 9.  Also, one pair of socks had the non-slip dots on the wrong side.  You can tell pretty easily because the holes for your toes align well with the holes.  The largest hole fits your big toe and then they become increasingly smaller (of course).  Since the holes get increasingly smaller you can't flip them and wear them on either side.  It's annoying."
1.0,No No No
1.0,Fell apart in less than month
1.0,They are 3 sizes under normal sizes.  Also missed return window because was a gift.  So 140 dollar boot goes to good will.  Third time trying to buy shoes on Amazon.  Never again.  It appears Amazon male shoe vendors focus on men with effeminate feet or they intentionally are undersized to save material knowing most men are terrible at retuning stuff.  I just went to a real store paid more but got a boot that fits.
1.0,The hook is very loose and is not secure
1.0,Turns orange/green after a while. Not worth it.
1.0,The bracelet broke after 2 wears.
1.0,"broke within 2 days of having it, save your money."
1.0,These come really small for sizing and are a weird stretchy almost athletic material. They are made super cheap and come awfully wrinkled and takes a lot of ironing to get those out.
1.0,"The cut is very full in the shoulders and so narrow at the bottom I can't button it.  The buttons and holes on the opposite side of a ladies top or jacket. Weird that they sell this to women, it's made for men."
1.0,I originally bought this in a 3x after reading reviews. It fit like an xl so i reordered it in a 5x!<br />That came and WAS SMALLER than the 3x!!! Just do not bother.
1.0,really an odd fit. id have to have someone help me hold that tighter to ever get it zipped
1.0,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing. My son wanted this for Christmas. I was disappointed upon opening the box. It is very cheap looking, think worse than dollar store, at least at the dollar store it is a dollar."
1.0,"This watch broke as in no longer  can keep time after wearing it for less than one day.  It is very cheaply made and the fact that it does not<br />work I would like a full refund.  It is as if I bought it from China, do not buy this watch, don't waste your 20 bucks.  Very very<br />disappointing.  Amazon you are going to ruin your reputation selling junk like this."
1.0,"The dress is falsely advertised to be polyester with chiffon fabric in the picture and description, but it really only has chiffon sleeves. All you get is this polyester dress that should be the lining and it makes the dress a shade different than the sleeves. Such a disappointment really. I had bought it for my mom to wear at my wedding and we both hate it so much that I must return it."
1.0,After just 5 days of light use one of the shoe laces started to fray. Fortunately it held until I was able to get a set of rihno laces yo replace them.<br />Would not buy again.
1.0,Way too small and very thin.
1.0,"Plastic, keeps breaking, faded almost immediately"
1.0,"Although material is good, it is poorly executed!!! It has no shape at all!! Far from flattering! Does not look as showed on the pictures! Don’t waste your time and money!"
1.0,Se despegó completamente
1.0,I bought 5 of these sets for gifts for Christmas with 3 pairs being good but unfortunately the set for myself wasn't made well at all. There were numerous areas that had loose threads hanging down. Nice and soft and hate returning mine but just wish this set was made a little better.
1.0,"Cheap material, does not fit like the photo shows.  I returned this item."
1.0,I got lenses only and a cleaning cloth. These were not glassesor as advertised.
1.0,"I bought this bag and before the first month the leather in the inside of the bag started to crack.<br />mine is black on the outside, brown in the inside, but with the cracked leather now it looks black and brown on the inside.<br /><br />I paid $395.00 for it. what a piece of garbage it is. i will never purchase a michael kors product again."
1.0,It came  apart  after  1 week
1.0,I really liked them but the rose gold didn't cut it for me. And it turned my ear green and it also turned green.
1.0,Came USED with stains AND ALSO WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BLOOD STAIN along with a horrible smell! SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!! Packing to leave on my trip today and no time to even return!!!! Total trash!!!
1.0,"Although the quality of the T-shirt fabrics and fit was excellent after the first wash the image chipped, stuck together, and the colors ran."
1.0,"Very cheap, looks nothing like pictured"
1.0,Could not find anywhere to set the time
1.0,Very cheaply made. Poor quality stitching. Rides up your crotch like crazy!! But ya get what ya pay for
1.0,"Let’s just start with it’s a totally different design. The material is not as advertised and it fit irregular like a toddler made it.  It’s  super frustrating when you receive this poor quality trash, that they want you to pay to ship back, it’s truly disappointing and disgusting that Amazon allows a vendor to take advantage of people this way. They not only do that but then pretend like the item is sold out by one vendor and use the same picture to fully stock under another vendor name. SCAM!!!!"
1.0,Too small and the color is different than the picture
1.0,"Unless you have time to gamble that you'll get a hat that doesn't look like it was sewn together in the dark, do not order this product. When I received my hat, it was so crooked it is a complete joke that it was ever allowed to be sold. The bill was lopsided and off center. The company has no quality control it seems. So while I'm sure there are some good hats out there, unless you have enough time to send back the hat and try again for a better one, DO NOT waste your time buying this."
1.0,Broke after just wearing once.
1.0,The “mask” is flimsy and rubber like. I would not over my head for fear of suffocating.
1.0,Cheap material. Don't waste your money.
1.0,This is not for a ratchet style speedflex as advertised
1.0,I bought this shirt for my son in law for Xmas. When my daughter washed it in cold water on delicate the blue faded all over the white part. The shirt was ruined. I felt so bad and really upset . I will not buy clothes from amazon again.
1.0,This is a dollar store hat with a kids iron on sticker. No professional would wear this.<br />I will be returning it.
1.0,You could not set date and time because clasp just spun around.
1.0,The strap would not stay snapped on to my gear fit 2.  I returned it.
1.0,Sorry to say these are not diabetic boots but simply a leather boot devoid of padding. Enclosed with the boots are two types of removable insoles. Very disappointed.
1.0,No me gusta decaería devolverlo
1.0,"After washing the pants they shrunk to a point that I am unable to wear, unfortunately I bought two pair.  This is why I generally do not buy clothes on line."
1.0,"Not sized correctly. If you buy, order two sizes larger than you wear."
1.0,Cheap looking!!! You get what you pay for.
1.0,"I bought three pair of these leggings. Every pair I wore was covered in huge holes by the end of the day. Horrible waste of money. Never, ever again will I buy this brand."
1.0,This leggins are not worth the price the looks snd quslity are the worst ever there isnt any brand label whatsover i ordered them to use then under a dress this leggins are not to use as leggings alone the lokks of the waist are terrble cheap
1.0,The material is not forgiving. Whatever size you wear get a size bigger. Didn't like it. Sent back.
1.0,way to tight
1.0,"Way too small, gave to my 11yr old daughter who’s 72lb. 🥴"
1.0,The size is not what I expected
1.0,Horrible not worth .75 cents
1.0,Shorts are huge. No way are they 18-24m. They could fit a 5 year old.
1.0,"I brought this Stacey Adam slide-on for my husband and it did not last 90 days without the sides coming completely apart.<br /><br />I would not recommend this shoe because it is poorly made.  Also, my husband said it was not all that comfortable also."
1.0,Ordered for Christmas gift. 1 of the skates on left shoes missing so you can not skate. And because of early shopping you can not return.
1.0,Very poorly made. They’re very tight. Inside has threads all over that makes it hard to get your feet in. Absolute waste of money.
1.0,First the brush is missing in my order.<br />Second the product is opened to put the the tray inside causing it to leak out in shipping.<br />Last this product did nothing to my coins. Even leaving in solution for a whole minute. Fingerprints and dirt are all still there. It's like I dipped my coin in water. Waste of money
1.0,After using it one time the straps started to rip.
1.0,"The fit was all off. One arm is longer than the other, the center &#34;v&#34; is lopsided, and the centered pattern is off be almost 4 inches."
1.0,The item fit my phone fine but the buttons do not line up with my phone so it is very difficult to turn phone on and off and to use the volume buttons. Would not recommend this case or brand at all.
1.0,The gloves already ripped apart at the fingers.  We used them for one snow storm to shovel the driveway...  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
1.0,Second d one I oi order cause first was 2 small.  This one was SMALLER<br /><br />DISAPOINTING
1.0,"The material looks cheap like something from Ross for $7.  Its robbed and kind of shiny, glittery.  I'll probably wear it one day as a last resort."
1.0,This purse was advertised as having protective metal feet. They were missing.
1.0,Horrible description!! Nothing like the advertisement picture. Disappointed.
1.0,"I wanted to love these panties.... they looked so pretty right out of the package with all the beautiful colors, but that is where the beauty ends. They fit more like a thong than a boyshort (not at all what I was looking for) and one of the five pairs already had a huge hole where the lace was not stitched to the elastic waist band. The cotton liner is the worst I've ever seen. It's about two inches long and in a diamond shape. There might as well be no liner in these at all, as it provides no coverage. I would not purchase these again. They are just a disappointment all the way around."
1.0,The earrings came apart while in my ear. Three different pieces. Very poor construction.
1.0,More sizes
1.0,The product is fine but it takes 5 weeks to get and would be terribly expensive to return. It is coming from Poland.
1.0,Broke after the first use
1.0,"I cant give it to my doughter, i need to know if you can exchange for another one size 37"
1.0,I don’t know who this is supposed to fit. Nothing about this top fit correctly. The padding was horrific and made no sense. I would not recommend this top to anyone.
1.0,"Does not fit too tight, scratchy & uncomfortable 🥵"
1.0,"I order the same size in this type of clothing all the time, these were too big"
1.0,Broke the same day we received them
1.0,"I've seen other customer reviews that it is made for a child's ear. It's not, it's just made for smaller ears. My daughter can use it but it pulls down on her ear. My girlfriend tried it and it fit her perfect IF she had a second piercing. So it's a hit or miss."
1.0,Horrible shirt. Cinching where the boobs are is way too high for anyone with bigger boobs. Material is thin and cheap. Seriously don’t waste your money.
1.0,Completely see through!
1.0,Refund please.
1.0,Had them checked out with a reputable jeweler and they are only gold plated (maybe)
1.0,Awful. Not even close to matching the size chart and looks/feels even cheaper than it actually was.!
1.0,These are not flattering or slim. Very boxy unflattering cut. Great if you have a thick build but not good for me.
1.0,"Item marked as Celtics tree of life...but item is wicca.<br />Can't expect computer to figure it out, or correct item to appear here in time, waste. Need QA."
1.0,Spend your money on something else.  These fall out.
1.0,It was cute but very delicate and broke upon the first wearing!
1.0,"These biker shorts were so thin that I wouldn't wear them without an over layer, and that defeats the purpose. I returned them."
1.0,"Very disappointed with this fabric, i was in cold all day and never felt like this material was a benefit to me at all. If i had not worn them all day i would have sent them back, not going to buy these again. And i need to add that i live in Deep South Texas where 29 degrees is not common at all."
1.0,There's absolutely no support with this bra it's cheaply made the straps slip constantly.
1.0,Super small total waste
1.0,I wear an 18...and i ordered a 4x...way to small.
1.0,The fabric is cheap.<br />It's nothing like the pictures.<br />Don't even waste your money.
1.0,"NOT off the shoulder at all!<br />I bought it to wear this summer, wanting something light and flowy, and off the shoulder to look sexy. It's too thick, and if I want it to come off the shoulder, I would have to stretch it out over time. It's not flattering at all. I'll be returning it."
1.0,So scratchy & thin fabric that I returned it
1.0,Not as advertised! Not made from bamboo! Label on outside says bamboo but product info inside shows that is false! I have had bamboo masks before and this was not bamboo. Also it appears to be a single layer of cloth with a pocket that it the second layer. So it is very cheaply made. I’ve see masks like this sell for $1.
1.0,"I used this for a month and it has stopped working effectively in the past couple weeks. I have to make sure my watch is sitting in it's cradle perfectly before it begins charging. Now, it won't even charge so I have to purchase a new charger and go without my watch for the next couple runs which is really frustrating."
1.0,Hard to get foot into the sock.  Cuff is way too tight.
1.0,Piece broke off; of course I missed the return window!!!
1.0,Not same bra pictured
1.0,"Unbreathable, makes you clammy.  I hate it!  Piece of junk that will be going to Goodwill soon."
1.0,"The mask is very big, too big for my face and there is no way to tighten around nose area which to me makes it not useful to help prevent from virus getting in.  Am trying to return but have not gotten response from seller for 3 days now.  Would not recommend"
1.0,Terrible. We maybe got a month out of these shoes before the bottoms completely separated. I would give no stars if it was an option.
1.0,Returned the scarf due to it being to slippery.  Didn’t stay tied around my neck.
1.0,"Work. They got wet and didn't hold up in ""all weather conditions"" please replace or refund. I have had other boots and it lasted me 2 years or more and I roughed them up and they stayed strong these are very cheap. Cheaply made thank you for your time"
1.0,Cheap made...
1.0,The fit was way off.
1.0,This dress was way to short.
1.0,"The jacket comes in a compress airtight bag. When I first opened it up it started to take shape but the material was starting to stick to the other parts of the jacket because its been compressed for a while. The material is like GLAD BAGS, TRASH BAG and it has a lingering smell to it. I don't recommend this at all and it hurts writing this negative review because I was so excited to get it but its cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture shown."
1.0,A poor fir. Waste of money.
1.0,Received a palazzo instead of a skirt.
1.0,Colors rub off and chip away
1.0,Total regret buy just isn’t what I like I went out of my comfort zone and tried something different now I know just stay with what I know I will like the purse is beautiful and well made roomy just not my style
1.0,Bought 100 pk and regretted it...they are too big!
1.0,Wrong dress
1.0,The fact that this blazer came to my home in a padded envelope says a lot. There's cheap quality ...and then there's CHEAP quality. It's super thin material basically cut into the shape of the blazer you see in the photo with zero fit or structure. Do NOT buy this blazer. It's worth about $1.00 for scrap fabric.
1.0,The fob slips off too easily
1.0,"Made a huge mistake on this one.  I just assumed with a name like Dr. Scholls attached to it that I was buying a quality product. WRONG! I have already thrown the black pair away.  I washed them before wearing and after walking about the house black balls of thread were falling off and were all over the carpet.  Also, they are indeed somewhat large and come off easily."
1.0,Thin short wrinkles bad
1.0,"The fit of the dress was not flattering at the chest. Where the material should have layed flat, it was bunched up and stitched."
1.0,"Fits really weird. Not made for any woman with bust, it definitely isn't made for anyone with shape."
1.0,This shirt is cheaply made and is garbage. I weigh 120 pounds got a large and it is to short. It would fit a child not an adult woman.
1.0,"I was so excited when I opened the package, then I noticed it had deodorant stains on the armpit area! Stains on the front as well. I'm choosing to wash and keep it instead of returning because I need it for an event tomorrow and I don't have any other options. I'm upset that I paid for what I thought was a brand new item and instead got something used. Sad part is it's a great top and fits well. Just wish it was new. Buyers be aware."
1.0,This was expired!! 12/14/16!
1.0,Absolutely  would not order this again. It is newspaper thin and the stitching is horrible. Barely any stretch. Overall not a good spend of my money.
1.0,"Nothing like the photo! You will be ripped off. As soon as I got the shirt, I returned it."
1.0,Very cheap material. As I was putting the pants on the seams were ripping apart
1.0,Dislike the material. Did not use. Will be returning
1.0,"I don't think this was really linen. I ordered the small and it was huge on me. I am 5'4, 123 pounds. It looked and felt more like a nightgown. The lavendar had a brownish undertone."
1.0,"This ""dress"" is just about useless unless you plan to wear it as a nightgown. I ordered a small and its still way to big and bulky and has no shape whatsoever."
1.0,"I had received this skirt as a gift last year, but it was a little snug so I gave it to my sister. I ordered a new one for myself this week, and the quality of the fabric has gone down significantly. It's now super thin. I've decided to keep it instead of dealing with a return, but if you are looking for a more substantial skirt (like Land's end legging fabric), don't buy this skirt. They changed to super thin stretchy fabric."
1.0,I have had this purse for a few weeks. The exterior &#34;leather&#34; is already cracking and separating.
1.0,"seeing it was 2% spandex, I expected them to stretch some, but they are super tight and the top button hole is too small to even use. Bought these for a vacation and didn't have time to return before I got back and sadly too late to return."
1.0,Cheap. Shortly after I got this bracelet it broke apart and the stones rolled everywhere. I threw it out. I do not recommend it.
1.0,"We ordered this for my son to start going to jiujitsu with me. The C00 top is way too big in the navy blue. Our friends son has the same brand, same size but in a different color and his top is a completely different size than my sons. I’m extremely disappointed because he wants to do jiujitsu but he’s got a bad top now until I can buy him something else. Waste of money."
1.0,"this is the worst item i’ve purchased from amazon to date. the material felt like something a toy baby outfit would be made of & the flag didn’t even have stars on it, they were just dots. i didn’t even try it on for sizing. don’t waste your money or time, because you also have to wait until they get it back to receive the refund, even back in credit."
1.0,Poor quality..poor fit..gave it to goodwill
1.0,"I bought these to replace a pair just like them that I'd lost. The fingers on these gloves, however, are at least an inch and a half longer than my fingers and thumbs. I can't wear them and can't return them because I threw away the packaging before I realized. Threw $25 out the window."
1.0,I wear a bonafide 2X. The shirt I received and subsequently tossed was labled 2X but was an XL at best.
1.0,beautiful just wayyy to small
1.0,way to big...sizes way off... look cheap
1.0,They run small; might work fine for kids.  One of the arms on the sheild was delivered broken.  They are very dark on the inside.
1.0,"Ordered a small and the bottoms were too big, I’m 5 feet, 130lb. I really was hoping i could fit it."
1.0,The black lace fell off after one week.
